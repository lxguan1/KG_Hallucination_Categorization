                      United States Senate,
                        Committee on Small Business
                                      and Entrepreneurship,
                                                    Des Moines, IA.
    The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 1:00 p.m. CDT, at 
Iowa Economic Development Authority, 1963 Bell Avenue, Des 
Moines, Iowa, Hon. Joni Ernst presiding.
    Present: Senator Ernst [presiding].

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ERNST

    Senator Ernst. Well, welcome everybody. We are going to go 
ahead and get started, so those that need chairs, if you can 
find one.
    The hearing is called to order. Good afternoon and thank 
you all for joining us today in beautiful Iowa. I know that 
some of you have traveled from out of state to be here today.
    As the Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business and 
Entrepreneurship Committee I want to specifically thank our 
witnesses for joining us as well as Sean Moore, the Committee's 
Democratic staff director, representing Chairman Ben Cardin. 
The issues facing small businesses continue to be the rare area 
of bipartisanship in Washington, and I appreciate the hard work 
Chairman Cardin, Sean, and their staff put in.
    Today's hearing is focused on rightsizing regulations for 
small businesses because one size does not fit all. Our goal is 
to examine the challenges small businesses face when they are 
forced to comply with the same regulatory requirements as much 
larger competitors. We will also discuss the benefits to small 
businesses when agencies adjust their regulatory demands 
accordingly.
    Small businesses today are drowning in red tape and 
unnecessary regulatory costs. In less than 3 years, the Biden 
administration has imposed almost $400 billion in regulatory 
costs on American businesses. By comparison, the previous two 
administrations combined, over the same time period, imposed 
$258 billion in regulatory costs, including during the 
implementation of Obamacare, with its hundreds of accompanying 
rules. In other words, the Biden administration has already 
imposed almost $140 billion more in regulatory costs than the 
previous two administrations did, combined. By one estimate, 
Biden's out-of-control regulatory agenda has imposed over 
$5,000 per household in costs, and I would like to submit for 
the record a Wall Street Journal editorial entitled 
``Regulators Gone Wild,'' showing the full scale of the 
overreach.
    Senator Ernst. How can any small business keep up, and 
folks, sadly they cannot. And while those numbers are truly 
staggering, they do not even begin to tell a whole story of 
just how complex the Federal regulatory climate is for small 
businesses in Iowa and across the country.
    While regulatory costs hit all businesses, they are 
particularly damaging to small businesses, which is why, since 
1980, the Regulatory Flexibility Act has required agencies to 
rightsize regulations by providing less-costly alternatives.
    When writing a new rule, the only way agencies can evade 
the rightsize requirement is by checking a box to certify that 
the regulation will not significantly impact small businesses. 
And folks, we know that any time Washington is creating a new 
regulation, chances are our small businesses will be severely 
impacted.
    Unfortunately, this has become a loophole for agencies to 
not put in the work to rightsize the regulation and provide 
flexibility to small businesses. The SBA's Office of Advocacy 
is an independent entity in the Federal Government that is 
charged with policing the Reg Flex Act, and we appreciate that 
the leader of this critical office, Mr. Major Clark, is with us 
today.
    When regulators significantly underestimate the real costs 
of regulations it results in very real consequences for small 
businesses. To illustrate let's look at just two regulations 
with broad impacts on Iowa small businesses that Advocacy found 
were improperly certified.
    First, the Federal Trade Commission recently underestimated 
the costs a regulation would place on auto dealer small 
businesses by almost $70 billion. Iowa franchised auto 
dealerships employ over 15,000 Iowans, and most are small 
businesses. I would like to submit for the record a one-pager 
from the Iowa and National Automobile Dealers Associations 
illustrating the problem.
    Second, the Environmental Protection Agency improperly 
claimed a rule defining Waters of the United States would not 
significantly impact small businesses despite the fact that it 
would likely affect every farmer and small businesses that 
wished to build a new barn or expand their business.
    In Iowa, 98 percent of agriculture businesses, 99 percent 
of construction businesses, and 89 percent of manufacturers are 
small businesses, and collectively employ over 46,000 Iowans. 
That is why I supported a resolution to repeal the WOTUS rule 
that passed the Senate, but unfortunately it was vetoed by the 
President.
    So what happens when small businesses or the SBA make it 
known to these regulators that their costs are underestimated 
and they should find alternatives to protect small businesses? 
Unfortunately, right now agencies can simply ignore them. This 
is why I introduced the PROVE IT Act of 2023, to prevent 
agencies from simply checking the box and empowering the SBA 
Office of Advocacy to require these agencies to show their 
work.
    My PROVE IT Act would require Federal agencies to prove 
they are not avoiding the Reg Flex Act and demonstrate that any 
new regulation is actually compliant with existing laws. It 
would also, for the first time, consider both the direct and 
indirect costs placed on small businesses, which would directly 
push back on the Biden administration's efforts to use far-
reaching global benefits to justify imposing any costs. 
Finally, my bill would give Advocacy the tools they need to 
require, rather than ask, agencies to consider less-costly 
alternatives for small businesses.
    I am proud to see that over 10,000 small businesses around 
the country and 75 small businesses in Iowa have sent letters 
to Congress showing support for my legislation.
    As you can clearly see, it matters when agencies simply 
check the box and avoid rightsizing regulations. One-size-fits-
all regulations do not suit Iowa's entrepreneurs, and that is 
why I am fighting to ensure our small businesses are heard and 
considered in future regulatory mandates from Washington. I 
look forward to hearing from our witnesses on this issue and 
how to address it.
    Now we will introduce our witnesses, and again thank you to 
our witnesses for being here today. First we have Major L. 
Clark III. He is the Deputy Chief Counsel, Small Business 
Administration Office of Advocacy. He currently serves as the 
Deputy Chief Counsel for SBA's Office of Advocacy. The SBA 
Office of Advocacy is the independent voice for small 
businesses within the Federal Government to advance the views 
and interests of small firms with Federal agencies. In fiscal 
year 2021 and 2022 alone, Mr. Clark and his staff engaged with 
Federal agencies on almost 40 regulations that led to almost 
$3.4 billion in estimated regulatory cost savings.
    Prior to joining the Small Business Administration, Mr. 
Clark was the Senior Corporate Officer for the Maxima 
Corporation and served as the Chief Administrative Officer for 
the House Small Business Committee. Thank you again for joining 
us today, Mr. Clark.
    Next we have Representative Shannon Latham. Shannon is the 
Representative for Iowa's 55th Legislative District in the Iowa 
House of Representatives, serving since 2021, and it covers 
parts of Wright, Franklin, and Hamilton Counties. During her 
time in the Iowa House, Representative Latham has been a strong 
advocate for Iowa small businesses and has been a staunch ally 
in Governor Reynolds' efforts to modernize the regulatory 
system and make Iowa the best place in the country to do 
business.
    In addition to serving in the Iowa House, Representative 
Latham also co-owns Latham Hi-Tech Seeds, a family-owned seed 
company headquartered in Alexander, Iowa. A fellow graduate of 
my alma mater, Representative Latham received her BS in Ag 
Journalism and Public Service and Administration in Agriculture 
from Iowa State University, and her MBA from the University of 
Iowa.
    And finally we have Mrs. Megan Green. She currently serves 
as the Counsel and Engineering Manager for Knoxville-based 
Weiler Products, which designs, engineers, and manufactures 
equipment for the paving market. Mrs. Green is a member of the 
senior leadership team and serves as the President of the 
Weiler Foundation for Charitable Giving. She was also recently 
appointed as a member of the People's Bank Board of Director.
    Prior to joining her current employment, Mrs. Green served 
as an in-house counsel for the State Farm in Bloomington, 
Illinois, counseling clients in multiple states on regulatory, 
legislative, and public policy issues. Mrs. Green also attended 
my alma mater, receiving her bachelor's degree in finance from 
Iowa State University and her JD from the University of Iowa.
    And I will also mention, while it was not in his biography, 
Major Clark also attended the University of Iowa. So we all 
have those Iowa connections.
    I do want to thank our witnesses very much for being here 
today.
    We will go ahead and proceed with the testimony, and Mr. 
Clark, we will start with you please, sir.

 STATEMENT OF MAJOR L. CLARK III, ACTING CHIEF COUNSEL, OFFICE 
 OF ADVOCACY, U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, WASHINGTON, 
                              D.C.

     Mr. Clark. Good afternoon, Ranking Member Ernst and 
distinguished guests. I am honored to be able to return to 
Iowa. It has been a while since I have been here, but fond 
memories during my period here. Iowa taught me how to be a good 
lawyer, not one of the bad lawyers, so I am very honored with 
that.
    Congress recognized the importance of small business to our 
nation's economy. As such, Advocacy was created in 1976, to be 
an independent voice for small businesses within the Federal 
Government, particularly during the Federal regulatory process. 
But that is not all that we do. Our legal team works to ensure 
regulations do not unduly burden small businesses, our regional 
advocates and our information team provide outreach to small 
business stakeholders across the country, and our economic 
research team conducts important research on small business and 
their roles, some of that which you have just heard from the 
Ranking Member.
    Advocacy's research demonstrates that small businesses 
continue to be a critical part not only of the nation's economy 
but also local economies, as here in Des Moines and in the 
total state of Iowa. We released a new small business profile 
series, which is available on the table behind you. It is the 
2022 Small Business Profile, which focuses specifically on this 
great state of Iowa.
    This research confirms that small businesses are a vital 
component of Des Moines' and Iowa's economy. Small businesses 
account for 47 percent of Iowa's employment, which exceed the 
national share. Here in Des Moines metropolitan area, 98 
percent of all businesses are small and account for about 41 
percent of employment.
    Our research also shows that small businesses play an 
important role in rural areas. For example, small businesses 
provide 54 percent of rural jobs in the United States. 
Advocacy's economic research also inform agencies on the small 
business economic impacts of their regulations, which is 
critical. It is also our hope that this now helps stakeholders, 
many of you who are here today, understand the critical role 
that you play as small business owners in the local economy.
    After hearing from small businesses like those here in the 
state of Iowa, Congress passed what is called the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act to ensure Federal regulations are not, as the 
Chairman said, one size fits all. Rather, Federal agencies must 
consider the impacts of their regulations on small business, 
analyze effective alternatives that minimize small entity 
impacts, and make their analysis available for you, the public.
     As the watchdog for small businesses, Congress charged 
Advocacy with ensuring agency compliance with the RFA. Advocacy 
is required to report to Congress every year on agency 
compliance with the RFA, and our report for fiscal year 2022 
was submitted to the Committees, House and Senate, in May of 
this year. Advocacy continues to remain active during fiscal 
year 2022. On behalf of our nation's small businesses, we 
submitted a record 37 comment letters to Federal agencies and 
hosted a record 30 roundtables on regulatory concerns facing 
small businesses.
    We also achieved numerous victories for small businesses by 
working with agencies on RFA compliance, including what was 
mentioned earlier, the $73.5 million in cost savings for our 
small businesses across the country. And these numbers were 
due, in large part, I think, to new methods that we implemented 
to reach more stakeholders, to reach outside of the Washington, 
D.C., area, including holding virtual meetings, roundtables, 
and events as we are having today, and also our site visits.
    In this current fiscal year, Advocacy has continued to be 
productive, and since October 1, of 2022, we have already 
submitted over 40 letters and held 23 roundtables this year.
    Advocacy has increasingly argued that Federal agencies need 
to conduct more outreach to small entities during the 
rulemaking process and improve the quality of their small 
business data. Advocacy relies on stakeholders, primarily you, 
to provide input in the regulatory process by writing comment 
letters, directing to Federal agencies, and by sending us their 
concerns. It is critical for all small businesses, including 
those here, to express concerns to Federal agencies on 
regulations that may impact their economic survival. Our 
success, in Advocacy, depends on you, our stakeholders.
    Madam Chair, this concludes my oral testimony, and I 
request that Advocacy's RFA report for fiscal year 2022 be 
included in the hearing record.
    Thank you for this opportunity to testify today, and you 
know that I am happy to answer any questions that you may have, 
so thank you.

        STATEMENT OF REP. SHANNON LATHAM, IOWA HOUSE OF 
                REPRESENTATIVES, DES MOINES, IA

    Ms. Latham. Thank you. Good afternoon, Ranking Member 
Ernst, members of the Committee, and distinguished guests. It 
is a real honor to be here as a representative of Latham Hi-
Tech Seeds to provide insights about difficulties faced by 
small businesses when complying with regulatory requirements.
    Latham Hi-Tech Seeds is a third-generation, family-owned 
seed company that is headquartered on our family's Century Farm 
in north central Iowa. Latham brand hybrid seed corn, soybeans, 
and alfalfa products are sold across the Upper Midwest, 
primarily through a farmer-dealer network.
    We are proud to have celebrated our company's 75th 
anniversary in 2022, but our success did not come without 
overcoming obstacles, and some of the obstacles we face today 
include gene editing, antitrust enforcement, and trucking.
    So I will begin with gene editing. Sustainable agriculture 
and food production require a range of innovative solutions, 
including the latest precision plant breeding tools, like gene 
editing. These tools allow plant breeders to develop better 
crops, in less time, with more accuracy than other methods. And 
because our seed company has a corn breeding program, we are 
greatly concerned with EPA's recent final rule on plant 
incorporated protectants. The EPA's precautionary and process-
based policy imposes non-risk-based regulatory hurdles for 
certain plant characteristics created using the latest 
precision breeding tools.
    And antitrust enforcement. Consolidation in agriculture, 
livestock, fertilizer, chemicals, and seed is reducing 
competition, and we know that reduced competition leads to 
increased costs. The United States Department of Agriculture, 
in March 2023, issued a competition report that issued 
recommendations of being a voice for farmers and plant breeders 
as well as interagency coordination to promote fair 
competition.
    And trucking, I could have gone on a while for trucking. 
The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Motor Carrier 
Safety Administration Entry Level Driver Training final rule 
went into effect in February of 2022. The additional coursework 
costs between $1,000 and $4,000, depending on the course and 
the provider. This is a really large investment for small 
businesses. Whenever you add time and money it discourages 
people from actually getting their CDL.
    In addition to decreasing regulatory costs, one policy 
change that can help address trucking shortages is lifting 
interstate weight limits and making them uniform nationwide. 
Increasing interstate weight limits would create added 
efficiencies to transporting goods.
    During the 2023 session, the Iowa legislation passed a 
resolution encouraging Congress to increase weight limits on 
interstate highways in Iowa. Iowa allows higher weight limits 
on our state highways during the business times for 
agriculture. And because drivers can operate heavier loads on 
road that are under state jurisdiction they often avoid 
interstates. If the interstate system allowed heavier loads, 
truck drivers could take the most direct route, they would save 
driving time, and reduce fuel usage.
    And finally, electronic logging devices, or ELDs, are time-
consuming and expensive for small businesses. It is especially 
challenging for businesses like ours that serve rural America. 
Electronics are prone to error, plus there are just a lot of 
areas in our trade territory where we lose phone service and we 
cannot get satellite signals.
    Another downfall is that these logs start clocking your 
time as soon as the truck moves. So it is problematic for a 
company like ours, like when we are trying to just load seed 
from a dock, because it will begin to clock the time. And then 
we have had instances where the driver forgot to log out, and 
then it made it look like the truck was parked and he was 
there. Yeah, you can overcome those, but it takes time and 
energy, and it just detracts from your day-to-day business.
    One solution for the overburdensome ELD regulations is to 
exempt companies with five trucks or fewer. Another solution is 
to just simply exempt anyone who carries 100 percent of their 
own products. This solution offered for ELDs is an example of 
how one-size regulations do not fit all businesses. Small 
businesses frequently encounter challenges stemming from 
regulations that were designed for larger enterprises. Examples 
include burdensome paperwork, expensive compliance measures, 
and intricate reporting requirements.
    These issues all impede growth, discourage innovation, and 
often lead to disproportionate costs that hinder small business 
success. I encourage this Committee to consider the 
recommendations presented here.
    The written document I submitted also includes comments 
that I gathered from other small business owners throughout my 
district and across the state. As a member of the Iowa House of 
Representatives, I visit regularly with business owners, and it 
is my honor to represent them.
    Thank you for your attention. Together I know that we can 
help Federal regulations become a catalyst rather than a 
hindrance for small business success. And you know I would be 
happy to answer questions.

    Senator Ernst. Wonderful, and thank you Representative 
Latham.
    And Mrs. Green.

  STATEMENT OF MEGAN GREEN, COUNSEL AND ENGINEERING MANAGER, 
                 WEILER PRODUCTS, KNOXVILLE, IA

     Ms. Green. Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you to 
Ranking Member Ernst for inviting me to testify today. My name 
is Megan Weiler Green and I am Counsel and Engineering Manager 
for Weiler Products in Knoxville. We are a heavy equipment 
manufacturer. We do everything from design to taking raw steel 
all the way to a finished product. We make heavy equipment, 
primarily for the asphalt paving industry.
    I am also a second-generation business owner. Our business 
was started in 2000, with 4 employees and we have 615--or 618 
or 620, depending on the day--employees now. What started as a 
small business in a 40,000-square-foot spec building is now 
625,000 square feet under roof. Our equipment is sold into all 
50 states and 15 countries.
    We are the market leader because we listen to our 
customers. We are proactive. We move quickly. We are innovative 
and find innovative solutions. And we are hands on. These core 
values describe many small businesses and many Iowa success 
stories. But they are often at odds with government regulators 
and government regulations. Entire industries are born out of 
interpreting government regulations for small businesses.
    We know from our experience that every minute one of our 
employees spends trying to decipher new regulations, creating 
reports to respond to regulations, purchasing new systems that 
add no value to our organization other than compliance with a 
new regulation is a minute taken away from what we do best: 
serve our customers and design industry-leading equipment.
    As we react to new regulations, small businesses are often 
left wondering ``who is this benefitting?'' The purpose of 
regulations is often nonobvious from the perspective of those 
who are asked to comply. We have also seen several instances of 
regulations being announced alongside the deadline for 
compliance. While we, as a business, work diligently to 
decipher unreadable regulatory jargon, announcements from the 
government are released days before that compliance deadline 
hits, saying we are going to move that date back. There is no 
recognition of the wasted time and duplicative effort that that 
puts on our business.
    Similarly, our team works together to gather complicated 
reports and data to respond to various mandatory surveys and 
government requests for information. While the demand for this 
information is firm, there is no discernible benefit to us, as 
a company, or explanation as to how the collection of this 
information is moving the greater good forward.
    In business, we operate in cost/benefit analyses. In order 
to come out with an accurate assessment, we need information 
that we can rely on. When new regulations are announced, we are 
often in a position to ask ourselves: Does this apply to our 
business? What does this mean for our business? Can I find 
anyone in this government agency who can answer my questions? 
And maybe most importantly, what happens if I do this wrong?
    When the rules are unknown, or the rules change in the 
middle of the game, we cannot trust that we are making 
decisions in the best interest of our customers and our 
employees.
    Entrepreneurs and small business owners created their 
companies out of a passion for a product, a passion for serving 
customers, or a passion for improving the status quo. No one 
starts their own business out of a passion for the paperwork. 
Dedicating resources to regulatory compliance makes it more 
difficult for small businesses to compete with large companies, 
who can depend on big staff and healthy budgets dedicated to 
outside experts who can assist with information gathering, 
compliance, and audits.
    The bottom line is this: small businesses want to do the 
right thing. The Senate Committee on Small Business and 
Entrepreneurship can assist by helping small businesses in the 
following ways. Help small businesses understand regulatory 
requirements and the why behind new regulations. Leverage data 
that is already required, rather than creating new reporting 
requirements. Be flexible on what the output looks like for 
small businesses. Provide resources and access to people who 
can help navigate changing rules.
    We appreciate the attention that Senator Ernst and her 
office is bringing to this issue, and I welcome any questions 
that you have and appreciate your time.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Green follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Ernst. Thank you. Thank you, Megan, and a big 
thank-you to all of you for being here today and serving as our 
witnesses. It has been very informative testimony, and we 
appreciate your unique perspectives on today's hearing.
    Mr. Clark, we will start with you, sir, and thank to you 
and your staff for the great work that you do on behalf of our 
small businesses in Iowa and across the country. I also want to 
thank Darcella Craven, who is the regional advocate serving 
Iowa and the Midwest. Thank you for being here and for being a 
resource for Iowans.
    Mr. Clark, Federal agencies often improperly certify that a 
regulation will not significantly impact small businesses to 
avoid the Regulatory Flexibility Act, such as the EPA's WOTUS 
rule. Can you share why this happens and the significance of 
this issue for our small businesses?
    Mr. Clark. Thank you for your question, and yes, I can give 
you our insight as to why it may happen--well, not may happen. 
It does happen in some of the situations.
    One of the things--and I enjoyed the testimony from the 
other two distinguished guests because everything that was said 
kind of fit into what we look and see and do. But one of the 
things that is missing in this equation, extensively, is 
adequate data on small businesses. One of the things that we 
attempt to do when we worked with agencies is to get agencies 
to understand, as this hearing is talking about, one size does 
not fit all. So we want agencies to be able to break down their 
small business data to better respond to the types of small 
businesses that are being impacted, the small business that is 
1 to 5 member employees, or 10 member employees, or 20 members 
employees, because that analysis has a different impact on each 
one of those groups. So that is one of the issues that goes on 
with this certification.
    The other issue is with training. Executive order--I cannot 
remember the executive order. Gray hair makes me forget 
executive orders. But there was an executive order that 
requires us to train agencies on the compliance with the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act. And we, in our RFA report, talk 
about the amount of training that we have done. That training 
has been very instrumental, I think, in getting some of these 
agents to better understand the significance of why it is 
important to analyze small businesses. So we have to do more 
training.
    And I think the other part of it is really the overall just 
education that goes on with this whole process. And that is, 
some of the agencies simply think that they are not going to be 
called to task in some of these situations. And what our office 
is designed to do, by statute, is to bring this to their 
attention when they fail to comply with these requirements.
    Senator Ernst. And Mr. Clark, so when an agency then 
improperly certifies a rule under the RFA, and you do bring it 
to their attention, you are notifying them in a timely manner, 
what then happens if that agency just simply chooses to ignore 
you?
    Mr. Clark. Well, several things happen in that situation. 
First, some of the agencies attempt to provide this 
certification when the rule is in its proposed stage. And when 
it is in that particular stage one of the things that we bring 
out to them is that depending on what that rules is really 
saying and depending on how they have provided the information 
we will bring out to them that they did not provide an 
adequate, factual basis for this particular rule.
    And in that regard, we will basically provide them with an 
alternative, and the alternative is to either provide a better 
factual basis to comply with the certification requirement or 
to conduct what is called an IRFA, an Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis, which goes into a little more detail in 
terms of the impact of that rule on small businesses. That IRFA 
looks at alternatives that the agency could come up with, and 
so forth.
    So in that regard, as a proposal, we are watching that 
process. If that rule actually goes final one of the things 
that his required, again, by another executive order, is that 
agency has to, in its final regulation, specifically mention 
what Advocacy has shared with them, told them about that 
process. And that then becomes--the next level for that clearly 
is the basis for litigation once that rule goes final.
    Senator Ernst. Okay. So just bottom line up front then, an 
agency, they do not have to change the rule, even if presented 
alternatives by Advocacy. Would that be correct?
    Mr. Clark. They do not have to change the rule but they 
have to provide a factual basis for that rule, such as we were 
talking about with the trucking here. They are going to have to 
show how that particular rule, what is the factual basis for 
that rule, how that rule impacts small businesses so that in 
that proposal stage that information can then be shared with 
the public for comment. Because if that certification does not 
have that factual basis then we are not able to get testimony 
from a Latham Seed or anyone else in terms of the impact that 
regulation is having.
    So the critical piece of that is the factual basis and then 
being able to get public input as to the impact.
    Senator Ernst. Right. And so you stated then that the 
organizations do have that right to judicial review of those 
improper certifications. You cannot bring the lawsuit until 
after the rule is finalized. And can you talk about why that is 
an issue and whether review of the certification prior to the 
finalization could give small entities some real relief?
    Mr. Clark. Well, the review prior to the certification 
would actually give small entities--we say small entities but 
we are really saying small businesses--would really give small 
businesses the opportunity to better dissect that rule in terms 
of impact. And it would also give small businesses a better 
opportunity to propose alternatives to what is being proposed.
    I mean, for example, we just heard from dealing with 
trucking. Would exempting small businesses from one to five 
employees be better than just a blanket covering of that 
situation? So that is why it becomes important to have that 
factual basis, and that is why it becomes important for 
stakeholders, here today and across the state of Iowa, to be 
able to provide us with comments so that we can better 
challenge the agency in terms of what they are proposing.
    Senator Ernst. Very good. Thank you, sir.
    Representative Latham, thank you for joining us as well and 
the great work that you do serving the 55th District of Iowa. 
And I would like to start by asking you about the state-led 
efforts here in Iowa to reduce the regulatory burden on small 
businesses.
    So can you share what you think are the greatest success 
stories and whether there are any lessons that I could take 
from your examples back to Washington?
    Ms. Latham. Sure. I would be glad to share what I think are 
a couple of our successes at the state level. Three examples of 
recently passed legislation come to mind. One is updating the 
Iowa code on youth employment, another one is realigning state 
government, and then prohibiting local regulations on home-
based businesses.
    So when we were working on updating youth employment it was 
not without controversy. But what we did is we just stuck to 
the facts. We also made sure we listened to Iowans and small 
businesses who are living this day-to-day, and that is really 
what guided our decision-making. We believe that youth 
employment can help. It is not going to totally solve the 
workforce crisis, but it is certainly going to help, especially 
in businesses that need help at night, on the evenings, 
weekends, and during the summer.
    One of the things that was outdated--and I am smiling as I 
even think about this--is why should teenagers in the workplace 
not be able to use a microwave? I mean, that was one of the 
questions we asked because they were prohibited from doing 
that. As someone who grew up in a family restaurant and bar, 
there were times when there were two of us working, and we were 
swamped, but I could not help in ways like grabbing the 
alcoholic beverage off the bar and taking it to a table I was 
already serving. She would have to walk all the way around. 
That is a change that has been made. If an adult is present, 
the parents approve it, you are in full sight, why not let that 
17-year-old just simply deliver the alcoholic beverage.
    The third one is why should teenagers not be able to work 
past 7 p.m.? That is the heart of the dinner rush hour. They 
were prohibited from working past 7:00. As a mom of an athlete 
who played four sports, I mean, I would have loved him to be 
home at 7 p.m., but there were times when games started after 
that and buses did not get home until late. So why are we 
penalizing teenagers who want to work?
    So we removed those barriers while still keeping the 
requirements for safety and training and supervision in place. 
So that is one.
    Another one that I think is worth exploring is passing 
prohibitions on local regulations. We did that for home-based 
businesses. It pertained to requiring applications, permits, 
fees, zoning. Basically what it would do is allow startups to 
grow up a little bit before they had to comply with all of the 
regulations of a storefront business.
    The other thing that the realignment did that we passed 
this session was really to simplify the regulatory process so 
now it is almost one-stop location from the Iowa Department of 
Inspection and Appeals for licensing, building permits, safety. 
I think the more we can simplify processes for small 
businesses, the better. I mean, I agree with Mrs. Green when 
she said small businesses really want to comply, so let's not 
make it overly cumbersome, so we can help them do the right 
thing.
    And then I think I would also be remiss if I did not 
mention childcare. It is a huge workforce issue. We know that 
there are people who cannot go to work because they cannot find 
quality childcare. And the last 3 years I have served in the 
Iowa legislature we have sent 11 childcare-related bills that 
the governor has signed. Many of these came from her task 
force. I think whenever people hear ``task force'' they think, 
oh, that is just somebody checking the box, but really, there 
were recommendations that were implemented that are making a 
difference.
    And again, I truly believe that is just key to economic 
growth, is helping get those highly skilled, highly qualified 
people back in the workforce. So those are just a few of the 
highlights.
    Senator Ernst. Wonderful. No, that is fabulous, and I am 
very excited that our Iowa House and Senate and the Governor's 
Office have been able to find a way forward on these issues. 
And thank you for mentioning, as well, childcare. We did just, 
in the recent package that we put through, the Senate Small 
Business Committee did include a provision within that package 
for childcare, expanding opportunities for childcare, and 
thanking Senator Jacky Rosen for working me on that issue, and 
Senator Ben Cardin for including that in this recently passed 
package.
    We have some work to do with the House, but still great 
effort moving forward. It is key to getting people back into a 
place of employment if they know that they have safe and low-
cost childcare available to them. So thank you.
    Mrs. Green, for you. Again, thank you for being with us and 
for sharing your story as well because it is really an 
incredible Iowa success story, so thank you. Iowa is very, very 
lucky to have Weiler Products in our state.
    In your testimony you discussed the difficulty of trying to 
grow a small business, manufacturing business, in a field with 
many, many large competitors. So why do you believe it is hard 
for a company like Weiler to face the same regulations and 
costs as larger manufacturers?
    Ms. Green. Well thank you for the question. I think it 
really comes down to resources. It is hours in the day. 
Workforce continues to be an issue for us. And even if we were 
fully staffed, we want our employees to focus on what moves our 
company forward, which is taking care of our customers.
    I think what we are seeing in many government regulations 
is uncertainty and things being passed that may never be 
implemented or things being implemented that may later change. 
And uncertainty is really expensive for businesses, in general, 
and it is increasingly expensive for small businesses. And if 
you think about even in your personal life, uncertainty is 
expensive, it is a distraction, and it takes our focus away 
from where it needs to be, which is customers and innovation on 
the business front.
    Senator Ernst. That is very good. I was doing a county 
visit earlier today in Taylor County, and that was brought up 
by a number of the farmers, the contractors, the state workers. 
It was at a conservation project that had been done in some 
farmland. And they mentioned just the changes in rules and 
regulations from one administration to the next, and that 
uncertainty, how it affects the decision-making process of 
those that are investing in their farmland, in their 
businesses. That is a very, very good point.
    Representative Latham, going off of Mrs. Green's comments, 
I am going to ask you to take off your legislative cap and 
focus on your business cap and ask the same question as well. 
Can you please talk about why it is so important to ensure 
regulations are rightsized so that your family-owned seed 
business is not burdened by the same costs as much larger 
companies in the grain industry?
    Ms. Latham. Sure. So family-owned businesses like ours are 
operating on much smaller margins, so regulations that might 
just be considered maybe inconvenient for a larger competitor 
could essentially shut down our business. It could put smaller 
businesses just simply out of business.
    You know, larger companies have resources that we do not 
have. You know, we do not have anybody on staff with a legal 
background. We rely a lot on trade associations to help keep us 
abreast of regulations. There are companies who cannot even, 
because of the economy they are in today, cannot even afford to 
pay for those associations. So they are trying to navigate 
through these regulations, and it really does have that ripple 
effect. You wind up with lower competition, increased costs.
    And it does have a ripple effect on the small communities 
too. Like I am just thinking at Latham Seeds we invest not only 
in our people but I mentioned we market through farmer-dealer 
networks, and those people are invested in their communities. 
They are the ones that are helping support the local league, 
the prom, the whatever. So as you get larger competitors who 
are not located in those communities, you have got out-of-state 
or out-of-country, they just do not have that same commitment 
to community. And then, ultimately, that affects the whole 
culture in the state of Iowa. We are a state of many small 
businesses, many small communities. That is really the backbone 
and the heart of who we really are, as Iowans.
    Senator Ernst. I really appreciate that context as well 
because we do have so many visitors that are here from out of 
state. The makeup of Iowa is large, in part, small, rural, Ag-
based communities where those small businesses really do 
reinvest back into their communities. You mentioned prom and 
things of that nature. But yes, that is how our communities 
survive is by assisting one another. So whether it is here in 
Iowa, whether it is in Maryland, wherever it might happen to 
be, all of these little, small communities made up of small 
businesses and people reinvesting in the livelihoods of others. 
So thank you for that perspective.
    Mr. Clark, we will turn back to you. The Biden 
administration recently changed how agencies calculate the 
costs and benefits of their regulations. According to the Wall 
Street Journal article I referenced in my opening statement, 
those changes have given agencies the ability to justify 
regulatory costs on Iowans by claiming the rules could provide 
global benefits.
    What are your thoughts on this change, and do you believe 
agencies should be required to consider indirect costs if they 
are going to consider indirect benefits?
    Mr. Clark. Madam Chair, I am not sure what global really 
means in terms of small business because as you just said, 
small businesses are really very localized. One of the things 
that we--as I said earlier in my testimony, one of the things 
that we strive to do is to provide and to solicit and to gain 
data on the various impacts on small business. So changing the 
cost-benefit analysis, I am not sure really deals with the 
essence of what happens with a regulation in terms of its 
impact on small business.
    We just heard from Representative Latham and Mrs. Green 
that it is the margins. So when you start looking at cost-
benefit analysis, and you are not able to break that analysis 
down into the detail it has to be broken down into in terms of 
the small business itself, it is hard to get a true cost-
benefit analysis in terms of the impact.
    We had a regulation some years ago with the Department--not 
some years ago but a few years back--Department of Defense on 
what is called RFI, radio frequency, and the Department of 
Defense did not want to do a cost-benefit analysis on small 
business. We were able to get them to do one, and what we found 
was that the small business that only had a contract with the 
Department of Defense for one or two items paid a great cost as 
opposed to that regulation than a business that had 10 or 15 
contracts.
    So it is very important, in Advocacy, when we look at this 
issue that we look at it from the context of who is being 
impacted, what size business is being impacted, and what are 
the margins, and what are the other parameters that impact of 
that situation.
    So when we go to whether it is direct or indirect, right 
now we are primarily looking at direct costs. But there are 
arguments to be made for looking at indirect costs. And the 
only situation that really occurs with looking at indirect 
costs is how far down that chain do you go to find the real 
impact, and continuing to go down that chain may force a 
missing of the family seed farm and other entities in that 
process.
    So we need to be careful as to how far we go down that 
chain, looking at indirect costs. But definitely look at direct 
costs and look at some baseline for indirect costs makes a lot 
of sense, yes.
    Senator Ernst. Thank you, and I had the same thoughts about 
global benefits. I was not sure exactly what the definition of 
``global benefit'' was. Thank you.
    Mr. Clark. Well, I am not sure it relates to small 
business, and that is our statutory authority, to look at small 
business.
    Senator Ernst. Right. Thank you very much.
    Mrs. Green, one important piece of the PROVE IT Act is that 
it would ensure small businesses like Weiler can easily access 
agency guidance documents and allow small businesses to comment 
on these documents to seek clarification or suggest 
improvements. Can you discuss your experience with guidance 
documents and whether this provision would help you and other 
small businesses?
    Ms. Green. I think the concept is wonderful, and if it is 
implemented effectively it has great potential to be really 
useful. The concerns that I would have are being sure that 
whoever the comments are going to have the ability to respond 
quickly to those comments and that whoever is on the other end 
of responding to those comments has the authority to buy into 
whatever agency that are responding on behalf of.
    I have a law degree so I am the one who ends up, on behalf 
of the company, calling a lot of these agencies, saying, ``What 
does this mean?'' And a lot of times the agency, either they 
are not really sure or we have not really gotten there yet, or 
I am not sure how that is going to apply to you yet. But all of 
the time when you call, what I am about to tell you is just my 
interpretation, this is not binding on this agency. I mean, if 
I were to answer a question to my customer in that way, think 
about how that would go.
    So I think that is just really important, that whatever 
advice we are getting from that agency, we have to be able to 
rely on it, because again, that uncertainty is so expensive, so 
distracting, and just makes it so difficult to run a business.
    Senator Ernst. Okay. That is a very important point, Mrs. 
Green. And you have the legal background. But when you are 
calling an agency they will state that ``This is just my 
interpretation. It is not binding on the agency that I 
represent.''
    Ms. Green. Yes.
    Senator Ernst. So again, why the call in the first place 
then, because it could change in the future. You may start to 
act on a rule or regulation and not actually have that be the 
right interpretation then.
    Ms. Green. Correct. And again, we would not be calling if 
we were not trying to do the right thing. We want to play by 
the rules, but we have to understand what they are.
    Senator Ernst. Okay. Very important point. Thank you.
    And for all of our witnesses--and again, thank you so much 
for this incredible testimony--I would like to finish today's 
hearing by asking one question to each of you, and we will 
start with Mr. Clark and then we will go on down the table.
    Mr. Clark, if you could leave one message for Federal 
regulators about the importance of truly considering how their 
regulatory costs hurt small businesses, what would it be?
    Mr. Clark. You are asking a lawyer to leave one message.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Clark. Well, the message to the regulatory community 
has to be that small businesses are the economic backbone of 
our nation, and if we do not have small businesses then this 
global environment that they are talking about does not exist. 
So we have to find ways to ensure that our small businesses 
continue to survive, but more so than continue to survive we 
have to find ways to ensure that they continue to grow and to 
expand and become multigenerational businesses because that is 
where wealth is built for many of our small businesses.
    So from a regulatory standpoint, it is clearly what we have 
pushed, and that is that one size does not fit all, that we 
must look at a deeper dive, take a deeper dive into the impact 
of the regulation on our small businesses.
    Senator Ernst. Thank you so much. And one of my favorite 
phrases, Mr. Clark, is ``not just survive but thrive.'' We 
really want them to thrive. Thank you very much.
    And Representative Latham, the same question to you. What 
would your message be?
    Ms. Latham. So if I could just leave them with one message 
it would be just because you can does not mean you should. And 
as a business owner, whenever we are starting a new project or 
somebody proposes a new idea, my very first question is what is 
the objective?
    So I think we need to ask, is it going to make it easier 
for small businesses, less confusing, easier for compliance? 
Does it increase safety? I think every regulation, every 
administrative rule should really be scrutinized to make sure 
it is even needed or is it vitally important.
    Again, less is more. The smaller the code is, the fewer the 
regulations, the more small businesses can thrive. Thank you.
    Senator Ernst. Wonderful. Thank you, Representative Latham.
    And Mrs. Green.
    Ms. Green. I would echo both thoughts. I think regulators 
need to take a step back and figure out what the end goal is, 
what is the actual objective that they are trying to 
accomplish, and then say is this actually moving the ball 
forward or are we regulating for the sake of regulating. And 
then just to continue with my theme of anything that we can do 
to reduce uncertainty and make it easier to run a business for 
the long term I think will be very effective.
    Senator Ernst. Wonderful. Thank you. Once again, thanks to 
all of you for joining us today, and a special thank you to our 
witnesses for their enlightening testimony.
    Before we conclude the hearing I would like to add to the 
record the following: an op-ed from John Sorensen, President 
and CEO of the Iowa Bankers Association, who published in the 
Des Moines Register. Thank you for that very much. We are very 
lucky to have you with us today. And also a statement from the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who I am thankful has sent Tom 
Sullivan, the Chamber's Vice President for Small Business 
Policy, to join us today. As well, a letter from Alfredo Ortiz, 
the President and CEO of the Job Creators Network, who we are 
also lucky to have join us today. Thank you, Mr. Ortiz. And 
then a statement from the National Federation of Independent 
Businesses; a letter from Dr. James Berlau, a senior fellow and 
regulatory economist with the Competitive Enterprise Institute; 
a letter from Daniel Goldbeck, the Director of Regulatory 
Policy at the American Action Forum; and a statement from Karen 
Kerrigan at the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council.
    [The information follows:]
    Senator Ernst. And with that today's hearing has concluded. 
I want to thank everyone for joining us today.
    [Whereupon, at 1:57 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
