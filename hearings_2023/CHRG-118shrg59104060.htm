                FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT
                   APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2024

                              ----------                              


                      TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
           Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations,
                                                    Washington, DC.

    The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:35 p.m., in 
room SD-124, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Chris Van 
Hollen (Chairman) presiding.
    Present: Senators Van Hollen, Manchin, Hagerty, and 
Kennedy.

                 U.S. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION

             OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN

    Senator Van Hollen. This Committee, the Subcommittee on 
Financial Services and General Government Hearing will come to 
order.
    I would like to begin by thanking my Ranking Member, 
Senator Hagerty, and other Members of the Committee for our 
continued oversight efforts of agencies under our jurisdiction.
    We are very grateful to be joined today by the Chair of the 
U.S. Federal Communications Commission, Jessica Rosenworcel. 
Welcome to you.
    The FCC has a very important set of responsibilities, from 
working to provide access to affordable high-speed Internet to 
keeping spectrum licensing competitive, and much more. The 
mission of the FCC is essential to ensuring that the United 
States remains on the cutting edge of communications' 
technologies in the 21st century, and that, in turn, is 
essential to the success of our country, our economy, and 
important, of course, to national security.
    I am pleased the Senate confirmed President Biden's 
nominee, Anna Gomez, to the Commission earlier this month, 
bringing the FCC to its full contingent of five Commissioners.
    And I would like to applaud Chair Rosenworcel and the 
entire FCC team, including all the Commissioners, for their 
rapid response to the disasters in Hawaii and Florida. Their 
work in the early days of the disaster helped save lives by 
ensuring that survivors could stay connected to their loved 
ones and to emergency response teams. Tragedies like this show 
us just how essential access to broadband is in our modern 
life. It is not a luxury; it is a necessity.
    And if we did not know that before the pandemic, we 
certainly know it now. America scrambled to get online; Zoom 
became a verb, and Congress worked through a number of measures 
to try to address these issues and get more Americans 
connected. Before the pandemic struck, I had introduced 
legislation to close what we call the ``homework gap'', because 
students without access to broadband were put at a big 
disadvantage when doing their homework, compared to their peers 
who were connected. But with the pandemic, now the homework gap 
became a full-blown learning gap. As classes went online, 
students who were unconnected were bound to fall even further 
behind.
    Many States and local jurisdictions used the emergency 
school funding they had through the CARES Bills to help their 
students connect with remote learning. But there was not a 
dedicated program until, as part of the American Rescue Plan, 
we established the Emergency Connectivity Fund, a critical 
lifeline to students around the country.
    And that Emergency Connectivity Fund has helped more than 
18 million students connect to the Internet by providing them 
with Wi-Fi hotspots, modems, routers, and Internet-enabled 
devices, as well as Internet service to those devices.
    This was an emergency measure, and its dedicated funding 
will run out in December. But it has established a strong 
foundation that we can build on by modernizing and adapting the 
E-Rate Program. We need to ensure that the E-Rate Program can 
provide connectivity beyond the walls of our classrooms and our 
libraries. And I know Chair Rosenworcel is passionate about 
this issue, and I salute you for your efforts.
    We must, of course, not only connect students to broadband 
but every American household and small business, no matter 
where they live--in rural, suburban, and urban areas. 
Nationwide, tens of millions of Americans remain without access 
to broadband, but thanks to the passage of the Infrastructure 
Modernization Bill, we are well on our way to connecting them. 
That law launched and funded the Broadband Equity Access and 
Deployment Program, known as the BEAD Program, to connect 
America.
    But the BEAD Program and other Internet connectivity 
programs would be flying blind if it were not for the FCC's 
broadband mapping program. For years, the FCC had a broken 
mapping system. Many Americans were told they were connected to 
the Internet when, in fact, they were not. By creating an 
interactive system, the FCC has dramatically improved the 
mapping process so we can implement plans to connect all 
Americans. There are still issues, and we are working through 
them, but it is much better today than it was, much better.
    My home State of Maryland received nearly $268 million to 
expand access to affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband 
across our State, and the FCC's map is providing crucial data 
to aid in the implementation of that effort. But we all know 
that getting people physically connected to the Internet won't 
do them any good if they cannot afford to pay the bill for 
services. That is why the Infrastructure Modernization Bill 
also launched the FCC's Affordable Connectivity Program.
    This program provides eligible low-income households with 
high-speed Internet plans at little or no cost. In my home 
State of Maryland, over 255,000 households have already 
enrolled in ACP, and more than 20 million households in every 
part of the country have enrolled in the program, and 
enrollment is growing by the day. The Affordable Connectivity 
Program has been vital to ensuring equitable access to high-
quality, modern broadband infrastructure, especially in rural 
areas, and low- and moderate-income communities.
    And today, we will discuss the importance of providing 
ongoing support for that program.
    Turning to another area of FCC responsibility, it has been 
6 months since the FCC's Spectrum Auction Authority has lapsed, 
the first time the FCC has not had this authority in over 30 
years. This is on Members of Congress to address, but we look 
forward to Chair Rosenworcel's comments on that matter.
    Colleagues, we need to quickly come to agreement so the FCC 
can conduct auctions that are necessary to ensure the United 
States remains on the cutting edge of global communications, 
technology, it is important to our economy and our national 
security.
    Today's hearing will give us an opportunity to learn more 
about that and other issues, and inform the work we are doing 
together on behalf of the American people.
    So with that, I will now turn to Senator Hagerty for his 
opening statement; Senator.

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BILL HAGERTY

    Senator Hagerty. Well, thank you, Chairman Van Hollen, for 
holding this hearing. As the Ranking Member, I look forward to 
working with you on this subcommittee and with all of our 
staffs to continue to make certain that our tax dollars are 
spent effectively and efficiently.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel, welcome to you. It has been good to 
get to know you by phone. I am glad to see you here today and 
looking forward to your testimony.
    As with the airwaves that are broadcasting this hearing, 
the FCC's influence on the economy, our national security, and 
the daily routines of American life is paradoxically both 
ubiquitous and invisible. The FCC regulates the non-Federal use 
of the electromagnetic spectrum that we rely upon for mundane 
activities, like our garage door openers, all the way to the 
global delivery of events that shape the world and allow us to 
witness history as it unfolds, in real time. And not just on 
television, but over mobile devices now.
    The FCC also regulates speech, specifically children's 
programming, campaign advertising, and indecency. But today, 
that is only for broadcasters. Whether the FCC should, or 
should not, or to what degree, regulate the speech of social 
media platforms is currently under debate.
    Personally, I have introduced legislation, the 21st Century 
Free Speech Act that would ensure that all Americans have 
reasonable, nondiscriminatory access to Big Tech speech 
platforms. It would also limit the ability of Big Tech 
platforms to discriminate against free speech on ideological or 
political grounds.
    That is because I believe that Americans, rather than Big 
Tech companies, should determine what information to consume, 
what information to share, and what information to believe.
    The FCC also, in coordination with other Federal agencies, 
has a role in regulating communications equipment, equipment 
that may pose an unacceptable national security risk, which 
means the FCC can prohibit the sale or use of domestic or 
foreign-made equipment in the United States. We are in an 
information age that depends on reliable and secure data, 
video, and voice transmissions, as well as reliable and secure 
networks and devices. We all experience that first-hand during 
the pandemic, trying to work from home while sitting around the 
kitchen table with our children who are trying to attend 
classes remotely.
    The FCC's highest priority, according to a strategic plan, 
is to help bring affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband to 
100 percent of the population. Once upon a time, back in the 
1950s, the FCC's highest priority was to bring telephone 
service to 100 percent of the population. Telephones, then 
rotary ones, were considered a necessity that should be 
provided to all.
    The FCC has come close, but still hasn't achieved ubiquity. 
As technology change, the definition of universal service has 
changed as well, to encompass wireless service, and now it 
includes broadband. I will also add that the definition of 
broadband has changed. At one point, it was the 10:1 standard; 
now it is 25:3, and in the future, it could be 100:20.
    In other words, as long as the definition and measure of 
universal service in broadband keep changing, then the goal of 
100 percent connectivity is practically unattainable. One 
thing, however, that has not changed, nor will it ever, is that 
resources are limited. The FCC relies on fees to pay for its 
operations. In Federal budget parlance, these costs are offset, 
which was often mistaken for free.
    These costs are not free. They are ultimately paid by the 
consumer. And it is this subcommittee's prerogative and duty to 
limit these costs, which are growing. If the FCC's full budget 
requests were enacted, then the FCC's costs will have grown by 
26 percent or 8 percent annually on average since fiscal year 
2021, excluding mandatory funding.
    As a former businessman, I want to see evidence of a 
corresponding increase in output or productivity for that type 
of investment.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel, I am certain that you will address 
these concerns today in your testimony. I look forward to 
hearing you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator Hagerty. We have 
been joined by Senator Kennedy.
    And now I am going to turn it over to Chair Rosenworcel. 
And we will not go through your long and very impressive 
biography, but just to say that the Chair has over two decades 
of communications policy and public service experience, 
including as the Senior Communications Council for the United 
States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation.
    And with that, let me turn it over to you. If you could try 
to keep your opening statement to about 5 minutes; and then we 
will take questions. Chair Rosenworcel.

STATEMENT OF HON. JESSICA ROSENWORCEL, CHAIRWOMAN, U.S. 
            FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Thank you. Chairman Van Hollen, 
Ranking Member Hagerty, Senator Kennedy; thank you for the 
opportunity to appear before you today, and for providing full 
funding for the FCC in your fiscal year 2024 bill.
    As a fee-funded agency, the FCC has worked hard to develop 
a budget that maximizes benefits to consumers while remaining 
fair to those responsible for funding our requested 
appropriation. We do this because the work of the FCC matters. 
Communications technologies power one-sixth of the economy, and 
I believe everyone needs access to these technologies to have a 
fair shot at 21st-century success.
    Although this is not my first hearing before this 
subcommittee, it is a first in other ways. It is my first 
presentation of the agency budget under my leadership, and the 
first time in our Nation's history that a woman has permanently 
led the FCC.
    So let me draw attention to some of the recent efforts of 
the agency. First up, our Affordable Connectivity Program, it 
is the largest broadband affordability effort in the history of 
the United States. It now helps 21 million households get 
online and stay online. But for this program to continue to do 
this good work, we will need additional funds because support 
from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will run out as early as 
April of next year. We have come too far to turn back. Keeping 
this program funded needs to be a priority.
    Of course, this program is not the only one to help get 
broadband to those who need it. I want to acknowledge that the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund, championed by Chairman Van Hollen, 
has also been instrumental in closing the digital divide, 
especially for students.
    Second, the FCC launched its Space Bureau. The space 
economy is growing fast, and the agency's satellite licensing 
policies need to keep up. I want to thank the subcommittee for 
supporting this reorganization.
    Third, we have modernized our regulatory fee structure to 
be more transparent and fair.
    Fourth, we have developed the National Broadband Map. It is 
a detailed effort to identify where broadband is and is not all 
across the country. This effort is iterative; it is improving 
all the time.
    Fifth, we implemented the Pirate Act. The budget increase 
you provided has made it possible to enforce this law.
    Sixth, the FCC is working to connect the most vulnerable. 
We are implementing the Safe Connections Act to assist 
survivors of domestic violence. We are also implementing the 
Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act to 
ensure that the rates for prison pay phone calls are truly just 
and reasonable. On top of this, we took steps to ensure video 
conferencing services have those that have become ubiquitous, 
like Zoom, Teams, and WebEx, are accessible to people with 
disabilities.
    Seventh, we are doubling down on our efforts to stop scam 
robocalls and robotexts. We have new technologies to cut them 
off and new legal procedures to stop carriers from sending 
along these scams, and our efforts are beginning to bear fruit. 
For instance, we were able to shut down a major auto warranty 
robocall scam, but we are going to need new tools from Congress 
to continue to keep this junk off the line.
    Eighth, we are connecting people to emergency services. We 
set up 9-8-8, the new three-digit easy-to-remember number to 
call or text the Suicide and Crisis Hotline.
    Ninth, we are focused on network security. We have updated 
our rules to improve the reliability of wireless networks 
during disaster, and for the first time in history, we have 
revoked the authorization to provide telecommunications 
services for Chinese communications providers. We have also set 
up the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement 
Program to remove and replace insecure equipment in our 
Nation's networks. To fully fund this effort, we will need 
additional funds.
    And tenth, we are focused on spectrum policy. We are 
identifying airwaves in the 7 to 16 gigahertz span to ensure 
the United States leads in 5G, 6G, and beyond. We have also put 
a premium on ensuring Spectrum reaches Tribal communities. As a 
result of our work, today, more than 80 percent of federally 
recognized Tribes have access to licensed spectrum.
    But as we plan for the future, we need Congress to restore 
the FCC's Spectrum Auction Authority. For 3 decades the agency 
has had the power to auction airwaves for commercial use. 
During that time, we have held 100 auctions and raised $233 
billion for the United States Treasury. Letting this authority 
lapse jeopardizes our wireless leadership and ability to 
compete in a global economy. Simply put, we need this authority 
back.
    Thank you again, to the subcommittee for your support for 
the fiscal year 2024 bill. And I look forward to answering any 
questions you might have.

    [The statement follows:]
               Prepared Statement of Jessica Rosenworcel
    Chairman Van Hollen, Ranking Member Hagerty and Members of the 
Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee, thank you for 
this opportunity to appear before you today.
    I want to start by thanking the Subcommittee for its decision to 
provide full funding for the Federal Communications Commission in your 
Fiscal Year 2024 FSGG bill.
    The work of the Commission matters. Communications technologies 
power one-sixth of the nation's economy--and everyone needs access to 
these technologies to have a fair shot at 21st Century success. As a 
fee-funded agency, the Commission has worked hard to develop a 
reasonable budget that maximizes benefits to consumers, while remaining 
fair to the industries responsible for funding our requested 
$410,743,000 appropriation. Your support will go a long way toward 
ensuring that the Commission meets its statutory mandates and upholds 
the core values of our laws--consumer protection, universal service, 
competition, national security, and public safety--all while keeping 
pace with ever-changing and advancing technologies.
    Although this is not my first hearing before the Financial Services 
and General Government Subcommittee, it is my first presentation of the 
budget as Chairwoman, and the first woman to permanently lead the 
agency in our Nation's history. I'd like to highlight some the 
Commission's recent work, made possible by your support of our budget, 
under my leadership.
    First, the Commission's Affordable Connectivity Program, the 
largest broadband affordability program in our Nation's history, now 
helps 21 million households pay for high-speed Internet service. Across 
the country, I have met with people who have been able to get online 
and stay online thanks to this program for work, school, healthcare, 
and more. Our current projections indicate that the appropriated funds 
provided through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to keep 
these households connected will run out as early as April of next year. 
I strongly support identifying a way to fund the Affordable 
Connectivity Program into the future to help more families get and stay 
connected to the high-speed Internet they need to participate in modern 
life.
    In addition to the Affordable Connectivity Program, I want to note 
the work the agency did with the Emergency Connectivity Fund, a program 
Senator Van Hollen championed. This one-time effort developed during 
the early days of the pandemic was designed to assist students and 
library patrons with access to connections and devices. To date, more 
than 18 million students have benefited from Emergency Connectivity 
Fund support. It has helped close the Homework Gap, ensuring that kids 
everywhere have the ability to get online for schoolwork both in the 
classroom and at home.
    Second, we are doing our part to keep pace with rapid development 
of the satellite sector and the growing importance of space-based 
communications. I want to thank the Subcommittee for supporting our 
ability to do this by approving the Commission's request earlier this 
year to establish the Space Bureau. The space industry has entered an 
era of unprecedented growth, which is fueling an increase in both the 
complexity and the number of applications for space services before the 
Commission. The Space Bureau is up and running and already hard at 
work. The Commission is preparing for the coming convergence of 
satellite and terrestrial convergence--we call it Single Network 
Future. And later this week, the Commission will vote on new rules to 
streamline our satellite policies and expedite the processing of space 
and earth station applications as well as a new licensing framework for 
commercial space launches.
    Third, the Commission made the regulatory fees that support our 
work more transparent and more fair. In August, we unanimously adopted 
a long-overdue, comprehensive review of our internal regulatory fee 
process that aligns the assessment of regulatory fees more closely with 
the burden of the work being performed by Commission employees in each 
category.
    Fourth, the agency's work to create the National Broadband Map--the 
most accurate broadband map ever created--will help close the digital 
divide. For decades, the Commission produced broadband maps based on 
Census blocks. In practice, this meant that if there was high-speed 
Internet service in a single location in a Census block, the agency 
assumed there was service throughout the area. Needless to say, this 
methodology overstated service nationwide. Following the Broadband DATA 
Act, in November 2022, thanks to the appropriated funds you provided--
$98 million total--the FCC developed its first location-based broadband 
map to paint a more accurate picture of where broadband is and is not 
available across the United States. This new map identifies every 
household and small business in the country that should have access to 
high-speed Internet service. For context, on how much more granular 
this is than what came before, in our current mapping effort the 
Commission identified over 114 million locations where fixed broadband 
could be installed compared to data from just 8.1 million Census blocks 
in our prior maps. We will keep iterating and improving this map and 
look forward to using this data to help efforts all over this country 
to bring broadband to everyone, everywhere. Given the time, effort and 
money that went into starting it up, we need to make certain that we 
have the resources to continue to update and maintain our maps well 
into the future.
    Fifth, we implemented the Pirate Act and enhanced our protections 
of licensed broadcasters from pirate radio. We did this with a $5 
million budget increase to our base appropriation to support this 
resource-intensive, on-the-ground work. In addition to tougher fines on 
those who violate the spectrum rights of broadcasters, the law requires 
the FCC to conduct periodic enforcement sweeps, and grants the 
Commission authority to take enforcement action against landlords and 
property owners that knowingly permit illegal pirate radio activity on 
their properties. In March, we proposed over $2 million in fines 
against violators. And in 2023 so far, we've issued 24 notices to 
property owners warning them of apparent pirate radio broadcasts from 
their property. At the current spending level approved by this 
Subcommittee, we will be able to continue this important work.
    Sixth, the Commission is working to connect the most vulnerable. 
This past February, the Commission took steps to implement the Safe 
Connections Act. Under this new law, the Commission now has authority 
to help survivors of domestic abuse to swiftly and securely separate 
from communications contracts like family plans and receive emergency 
communications support from Lifeline or the Affordable Connectivity 
Program for up to 6 months.
    We are also implementing the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable 
Communications Act. We are going to use this new law and the expanded 
authority it provides to ensure the rates for prison phone calls--both 
interstate and intrastate--are just and reasonable. We are going to use 
it to address advanced communications services like video. And we are 
going to use it to ensure access to these communications by those with 
disabilities.
    In addition, in June, we took steps to make the video conferencing 
services that have become ubiquitous more accessible to people with 
disabilities.
    Seventh, we are doubling down on our efforts to stop scam robocalls 
and robotexts. Robocalls and robotexts aren't just exasperating, they 
are a pathway for fraudsters to harm consumers. So, we have been 
attacking them from all angles--cutting off bad actors from our 
networks, requiring providers to block unwanted calls, and mandating 
technology to stop call spoofing. Some of our efforts are beginning to 
bear fruit. After we identified the companies behind the auto warranty 
robocall scam, we told the rest of the industry to cut them off and 
auto warranty calls fell by over 90 percent. We used the same method to 
reduce student loan scam calls by 88 percent. And because this is 
problem that requires coordination among law enforcement, we now have a 
memorandum of understanding with Attorneys General from 47 States.
    Eighth, the Commission is helping connect people to emergency 
services. This past July was the first anniversary of 988--the three-
digit, easy-to-remember number you can dial to reach the Suicide and 
Crisis Lifeline. Thanks in part to the Commission's work, if you text 
or dial 988, you will now be connected to professional, compassionate 
support for mental health emergencies.
    Ninth, the Commission is doing more than ever before to keep your 
communications more resilient and secure. For example, we have updated 
our rules to improve the reliability and resiliency of wireless 
networks during emergencies. We launched the Mandatory Disaster 
Response Initiative, which promotes service continuity through 
coordination, assistance, and information sharing during emergencies 
and disasters. And we opened up our Network Outage Reporting Systems 
and Disaster Information Reporting System for sharing with Federal, 
state, Tribal and territory access. Sharing this information will 
enhance the ability of these agencies to respond more rapidly to 
outages and help save lives.
    And under my strategy of ``deter, defend, develop'': deter bad 
actors, defend against untrusted vendors, and develop a market for 
trustworthy innovation, the Commission has taken a number of actions to 
protect our networks from national security threats. For the first time 
in history, we have revoked the authorization to provide 
telecommunications services for four Chinese communications providers. 
In addition, the Commission adopted my proposal to regularly review 
foreign companies' authorizations to provide telecommunications 
services in the United States. On top of this, we have launched the 
Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program to 
remove Huawei and ZTE equipment in our communications networks. This is 
important for our domestic security and also sends a signal to the 
world that going forward we will not support insecure equipment in 
essential infrastructure. However, the $1.9 billion previously 
appropriated to operate the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks 
Reimbursement Program is not going to be enough to secure our networks. 
After receiving and reviewing applications, we currently face a more 
than $3.08 billion shortfall to fully reimburse participating carriers 
for removal, replacement and disposal of the problematic equipment. The 
Commission has received its first reimbursement requests from 
participants and, unless a further funding source is identified, will 
only be able provide forty cents on the dollar to those companies in 
reimbursement.
    And tenth, we are finding more ways to use spectrum to support 
wireless communications into the future. We are working to free up more 
spectrum to serve as a launching pad for new technologies. We have 
already identified the 7-16 GHz band as prime mid-band airwaves for 5G, 
6G and beyond. That is why I proposed making 550 megahertz of spectrum 
in the 12.7-13.25 GHz band available for new commercial mobile use. And 
we're not stopping there, the FCC is already looking to what a 6G 
future could look like including its impact on the digital divide, 
machine learning, how it could make life easier and more efficient for 
consumers, and new ways to connect industries, technology, and 
communities. Those communities include Tribal communities, and as a 
result of our work in the 2.5 GHz band, today more than 80 percent of 
federally-recognized Tribes have licensed spectrum. That is real 
change--and real opportunity.
    But as we plan for the future, we also need to be mindful of the 
spectrum demands in the present. And one thing that absolutely needs to 
happen is the restoration of the FCC's spectrum auction authority. For 
three decades the FCC has had the authority to auction off airwaves to 
commercial actors to use to deploy, create, and innovate. But on March 
9 of this year, that authority expired for the first time. As this 
Committee knows, if this is not corrected, it could have a tremendous 
impact. Over the past three decades, the FCC has held 100 spectrum 
auctions and, in the process, raised more than $233 billion for the 
United States Treasury.
    Restoring this authority will provide the United States with the 
strongest foundation to compete in a global economy, counter our 
adversaries' technology ambitions, and safeguard our national security. 
Most importantly, we cannot afford to wait. The global wireless 
community is convening for the World Radiocommunication Conference at 
the end of this year. It is where we set the future of spectrum policy. 
Restoring the FCC's auction authority is the first step in doing that, 
and it is my hope we can do it soon.
    So that's ten things the FCC is doing to bring high-speed 
connectivity to everyone, everywhere that is secure, resilient, and 
ready for the future. The budget that this Subcommittee has provided in 
its FY2024 FSGG bill will help to support these critical efforts into 
the future. Thank you for the opportunity to join you today to share 
these details about the Commission's ongoing work. I look forward to 
your questions.

    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    And I am going to start where you left off on the issue of 
spectrum authority and just get your sense of what the harmful 
impact is to our economy, to our national security, to a whole 
range of issues because that authority has now lapsed? And if 
you could just provide your impressions about how we can best 
navigate a solution, which of course does need to come from 
Congress.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Thank you. The United States is a 
wireless leader. The smartphone started here, the application 
economy began on our shores, and we have powered this wireless 
revolution with spectrum. We have been able to take airwaves 
and repurpose them for new commercial use and hold commercial 
spectrum auctions. Those auctions have been a model for the 
world, and they have been lucrative for the United States 
Treasury. Like I just mentioned, we have raised $233 billion.
    But for the first time in 3 years, we don't have that 
authority. And this year is an especially important year 
because we are going to the World Radio Conference. That is a 
conference where global spectrum authorities gather every 4 
years to discuss their plans for the wireless future. And in 
the United States, we now do not have the authority to hold 
commercial spectrum auctions, and we lack a commercial spectrum 
pipeline.
    So what I am concerned about is that the future won't look 
like the past, and our leadership is less secured than it 
should be.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, thank you. Thank you, Chair 
Rosenworcel. And just, to my colleagues here, we have really 
got to resolve this. I mean, as you know, it expired in March 
and, you know, we are just hurting our own country and our 
economy. So I hope we will all figure out a way forward on 
this.
    If I could turn now to trying to connect all of America to 
high-speed Internet, and really ask you to focus on two 
programs that both you and I mentioned in our opening 
statements. One is the Affordable Connectivity Program. How 
many people are on it? How many people do you expect to join in 
the coming weeks? And what would be the consequences of 
Congress failing to provide additional funding for that 
program? And actually, I will wait until you answer that one 
before I ask a second question.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. All right, it gets complicated 
fast. The Affordable Connectivity Program is the largest 
broadband affordability effort in our Nation's history. It is 
the byproduct of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act. The FCC 
runs it; it means low-income households in every State can get 
access to support for basic broadband service. It is helping 21 
million households across the country get online and stay 
online.
    Right now, our best estimate is that the funding provided 
in that law will run out in April, and by April, we might have 
as many as 25 million households that are connected to this 
program. We have come so far; we can't stop now. We absolutely 
need another direct appropriation from Congress to continue the 
good work this program is doing. It has been of extraordinary 
benefit to people around the country who can now go to work, go 
to school, take health care appointments, and participate in 
their communities because they have reliable Internet access.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, thank you. As you said, I think 
24 million people and in every State around the country, this 
would obviously be a huge blow to our effort to really connect 
people, because physical connection is important, but if you 
can't afford it, it doesn't do you much good.
    On the homework gap issue, but as you indicated during the 
pandemic, we put in place the Emergency Connectivity Fund. 
Those funds will--those dedicated funds will expire at the end 
of this year. There was an emergency program, but we are 
hopeful that you will be able to adapt the E-Rate Program to 
make sure that we don't lose the ground we have gained and 
instead build upon that foundation. Can you talk about some of 
your ideas for doing that?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Sure. The E-Rate Program is a quiet 
powerhouse. Since 1996, we have been able to connect schools 
and libraries across the country to high-speed Internet. We 
lead the world in our efforts to do so. And what we need to do 
now is update that program for the moment we are in. So I have 
proposed what I call Learn Without Limits, where we use the E-
Rate Program and modernize it. For kids in rural America who 
spend lots of time on a school bus, we propose to use the E-
Rate program to develop Wi-Fi on Wheels, to hook those school 
buses up to the school network so kids who spend time on those 
school buses can get some school work done.
    I have been on buses in rural communities that have it; it 
is pretty dramatic, and those buses were funded by the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund, so we know it works.
    Now, the other part of Learn Without Limits is making sure 
every school library and library in this country has wireless 
hotspots to loan out. I think the E-Rate Program is well suited 
for doing both of those things, and in the process, it can help 
us solve that homework gap you and I have talked so much about.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. And we look forward to 
working with you on those initiatives.
    Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Chairman Van Hollen.
    And welcome again, Chair Rosenworcel. We have talked about 
National Security before. I would like to talk with you about 
it again today. We all know that Chinese technology is a threat 
not only to the Federal Government but to private industry here 
in America, and the FCC's covered list effectively bans the 
sale, bans the use, and the importation of certain 
communications equipment and services. I think it is a very 
potent tool.
    One of the things, and you and I have touched on this 
before, is it seems that the list is quite narrow, and so just 
as an opening question, I would like to ask you. Is the 
Commission being deliberately cautious here, or is there 
something that is holding you back?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. That is a really good question, 
Senator. The covered list is a list of equipment that our 
Nation's National Security authorities have found to be 
insecure, and as a result, it cannot be used for any FCC 
expenditure. So if you get money from us to help you build your 
network, you cannot use it to purchase any of that equipment.
    We update it from time to time, but we only are permitted 
under the law to update it if national security authorities 
identify additional companies. And so on a fairly regular 
basis, we reach out to those national security authorities 
enumerated in the law, like the FBI, like the Department of 
Justice, like the Office of the Director of National 
Intelligence, and ask for updates. And recently, we even wrote 
them with the names of two companies that had been brought to 
our attention by some Members of the House of Representatives 
and asked for their assessment on it.
    So if I could ask you to do one thing, it would be to make 
sure that those national security authorities get back to us 
and help us keep that list up to date.
    Senator Hagerty. That is a very helpful suggestion, and I 
think our work right here on the Appropriations Committee, we 
may be able to help in that regard.
    Staying on this, the covered list, what would be the 
implications of a more extensive list, even a retroactive list? 
How would that help you utilize the covered list to the fullest 
extent?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Well, a covered list has other 
values too. I just want to acknowledge that when we publicly 
produce a list of equipment that we believe is insecure that 
the government won't support we are also telling the private 
sector this isn't stuff you should be buying or using.
    Senator Hagerty. It is an important message.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. And we are also telling the global 
economy that we don't trust this equipment. So I do want to 
acknowledge that that list has power beyond just the FCC and 
our immediate programs. I think it is narrow because our 
national security authorities are careful, which is 
appropriate, but I also think we can't let this list wither. We 
need to update it from time to time and reaching out to them 
regularly as we do has been useful, but of course, you also 
pointing out that this should be a priority would be helpful as 
well.
    Senator Hagerty. And amplify the point you just made; when 
I was serving in a previous role as United States Ambassador to 
Japan, the third largest economy in the world, we were able to 
get them to block untrusted carriers because of what had 
happened here. Our ability to point to that, and the example 
that we set, as you say, can have repercussions around the 
world. So thanks for that to continue.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Absolutely. That is absolutely 
correct.
    Senator Hagerty. The strength of the covered list rests 
with the Commission's Equipment Authorization Program, and that 
predates the covered list. And my question is if -- you had the 
Equipment Authorization Program, are there other FCC programs 
that are already in place that might serve as a foundation for 
addressing national security concerns beyond the covered list?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. We have been exploring what kind of 
certifications might be necessary from applicants before the 
FCC.
    Senator Hagerty. Mm-hmm.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. For instance, if you are about to 
bid in a spectrum auction in the future, should you certify 
that none of your funding comes from countries whose revenues 
and governments we have concerns about? We have also been 
exploring whether or not when we give you an authorization to 
participate in our economy, what kind of national security 
questions we should ask at the outset, including what 
equipments might be used in your networks, and what kind of 
managed services you might get from some foreign-provided 
company.
    So we are looking across the board for other points to 
create opportunities for certification to make sure that 
networks in this country are secure.
    Senator Hagerty. As you think about the national security 
ramifications of what you do, and I am sure you do this every 
day, know that our staff stands ready to work with you, and 
that I would be very interested in any thoughts that you might 
have in terms of looking at existing authorities and new ways 
to utilize those. And frankly, if there is any way we can 
support you in that, or if you need our support, letting us 
know.
    Very quickly, I would like to turn to the satellite 
industry. It is growing; it has an incredibly important role in 
communications. The creation of the Space Bureau is intended to 
align the Commission's resources with its responsibilities. And 
I just want to get an update from you on what the current 
status of the space Bureau is, how you are going to know if the 
reorganization that you are undertaking is a success? How will 
you measure that?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Sure. First of all, I want to thank 
the subcommittee for supporting this reorganization. When I got 
to the agency and I saw the backlog we had of satellite 
applications, I felt that we had to reorganize to address them 
more rapidly. Just this week, the agency will be voting on an 
effort to streamline the application process. We also have a 
transparency initiative.
    And then globally, we are leading with what I call the 
``single network future'' because we are trying to develop a 
framework for figuring out how terrestrial wireless services 
can combine with new satellite services in the phones in our 
pockets and the devices on the ground. So I think we are 
actually making great strides. The challenge now is to continue 
and to hire people who can help us with all the applications we 
have before us.
    Senator Hagerty. And I would think you will find great 
opportunities as well for cost savings when you think about 
your connectivity objectives as well, utilizing this, as you 
call it, the ``single network'' approach----
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. The future.
    Senator Hagerty [continuing]. Future. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you Senator Hagerty. We have been 
joined by Senator Manchin, who has agreed to defer his 
opportunity to question first to Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Thank you, Senators.
    Madam Chair, welcome. You have been on the FCC for a while, 
haven't you?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Kennedy. You know what I am talking about then when 
I refer to the C-band.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. I do. I do.
    Senator Kennedy. Yes, I bet you do. That is sort of the 
part of the spectrum that the companies that want to roll out 
5G cell phone service really need; am I right?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. It is mid-band airwaves that are 
like Gold Coast territory for wireless.
    Senator Kennedy. All right. I am going to call them the C-
band. You will remember then in 2018, I certainly do.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Kennedy. Not you, but some of your colleagues on 
the FCC decided they were going to give the C-Band away, my 
words, not yours. At the time, that C-band, we didn't know how 
important it was. It was licensed to some foreign satellite 
companies.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. That is right.
    Senator Kennedy. And we discovered how valuable that C-band 
was. And the 5G telecommunication companies, mostly American 
companies, were really anxious to get it. And some members of 
the FCC, and frankly some senators, came up with a proposal to 
give that C-band to the foreign satellite companies and let 
them sell it to the 5G companies and keep the money.
    And I didn't like that, and neither did Senator Cantwell, 
and neither did Senator Schatz. And we called the President and 
insisted that--and the President called the FCC and said we 
need to bid this out. Do you remember all that?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. I do, Senator. Yes.
    Senator Kennedy. And we saved about $81 billion. Now, you 
have been auctioning the C-Band out. You held an auction in 
September, did you not?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Yes.
    Senator Kennedy. Number 107, I think it is called.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. I believe that is right. Auction 
107 as referenced here involved the auction of the C Band (3.7 
GHz band), but that auction took place between December 8, 2020 
and February 17, 2021. Auction 107 garnered over $81 billion 
for the U.S. Treasury and no longer has outstanding 
applications on file. Auction 108 (2.5 GHz band) occurred from 
July 29, 2022 to August 29, 2022 with the winning bidders 
published on September 1, 2022. Auction 108's licensing process 
was incomplete when the FCC's auction authority expired under 
Section 309(j) of the Communications Act.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. The problem, that we have got two 
problems here, your authority to hold auctions has run out.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Yes.
    Senator Kennedy. And number two, more immediately, you 
conducted some auctions in September, awarded some licenses to 
the C-band based on auctions, highest bidder.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. That is right. The licenses in 
question are for the 2.5 GHz band. The licensing process for 
the winning bidders cannot be completed due to the expiration 
of auction authority under Section 309(j) of the Communications 
Act.
    Senator Kennedy. Took those companies' money, and then your 
authority ran out.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. That is right.
    Senator Kennedy. And the FCC hadn't given them the 
licenses.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. That is right.
    Senator Kennedy. Why can't you give them the licenses, they 
paid for it.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. I agree with you, the situation is 
unfair. They paid for it. They deserve to have that license.
    Senator Kennedy. So why can't you give it to them?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. So the Communications Act is very 
straightforward. It says: Our authority to grant licenses 
expired on March 9, 2023. We got a lot of laws before us that 
are tortured and confusing, but this is a straightforward 
provision; it expired.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. And so we are going to need your 
help getting rid of that expiration.
    Senator Kennedy. What if we did two things? What if, number 
one, to solve the immediate problem, we passed a bill that 
said, only one time, short-term basis, we are giving you, Madam 
Chair, and the FCC, the authority to go ahead and award those 
licenses that people have already paid for? That is the first 
bill. The second bill would be to renew your authority to hold 
auctions. Would you have any objection to us doing those two 
things?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Sure. I don't object to you trying 
to be specific about the licenses in your bill. But I want to 
emphasize how much we do need that authority back.
    Senator Kennedy. All right. Tell me. I mean, this sounds 
very, very simple when we talk about it here, tell me, tell me 
who is pushing back on reauthorizing your authority to hold 
auctions?
    Senator Kennedy. Well, that is happening in Congress. I 
certainly have uniform support among my colleagues at the FCC 
for getting auctions reauthorized.
    Senator Kennedy. But who is--who is against it? And I am 
not asking personalities, I am asking what interest groups are 
against it?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Well, you know, the way that we 
auction spectrum, and have in the last several years, the C-
band being an exception, is we frequently identify airwaves 
with Federal users, from the Department of Defense, or the 
Department of Transportation, and we say, perhaps they could do 
the same function with a little less spectrum.
    And then we identify a way to take some of that spectrum, 
repurpose it for new commercial use. And then with the revenues 
from our auctions, we make the Defense Department or the 
Department of Transportation whole by giving them funds from 
the auction----
    Senator Kennedy. So you are getting pushed back from the 
Defense Department and the Department of Transportation?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Well, those are the two largest 
Federal authorities with airwaves below 6 gigahertz, so I 
focused on them here. But the reality is we are putting more 
stuff in our skies for communication than ever before, they all 
have to----
    Senator Kennedy. I know. But you can't say this, but I can. 
You are getting pushed back from Defense and Transportation. We 
have got a turf battle here. What can we do to sit down with 
DOD, and Transportation, and the FCC and work this out? We are 
all for national defense.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Absolutely.
    Senator Kennedy. We are also for 5G. So what can we do to 
get this worked out?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Well, I could offer the services of 
my office and my whole agency to assist you because I want to 
make clear that when our commercial wireless economy grows, 
technology expands, and the U.S. does better. That is true 
across the board.
    Senator Kennedy. If our Chairman called a meeting and tried 
to get everybody together, would you come to it?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. I would.
    Senator Kennedy. And would you bring your colleagues on the 
FCC?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. I would. Absolutely.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. We need to get this battle worked 
out.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. I agree with you.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Senator Van Hollen. Senator Kennedy, before I turn it over 
to Senator Manchin, I say, amen, to everything you said, both 
in terms of making sure that those companies that have already 
paid for their spectrum should get it. But they could also get 
that if we just reauthorize the--write the authority to enter 
into these contracts.
    I talked to Senator Cantwell about this issue today, who 
chairs the Senate Commerce Committee with authorizing 
jurisdiction. Not a long conversation. But I agree with you. We 
need to get this done in the coming weeks because it is hurting 
all of us. Thank you.
    Senator Manchin.
    Senator Manchin. I also agree. Let me just say this, the 
fiscal year 2021 Omnibus Bill appropriated $1.9 billion to 
carry out the Secured and Trusted Communications Networks 
Reimbursement Program, which is also known as a Rip and Replace 
Program.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Yes.
    Senator Manchin. For all the people that we say are out 
there that we got to get off these services. Where do you stand 
on that? What are the security implications that we are not 
fully aware of, and we are not----
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Well, there is insecure Chinese 
equipment----
    Senator Manchin. Right.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel [continuing]. And many of our 
Nation's smallest wireless carriers, and Congress provided us 
with $1.9 billion to take it out so they could replace it.
    Senator Manchin. Right.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. But as I have told the authorizing 
committees, we need an additional $3.08 billion to fully take 
that equipment out securely and place----
    Senator Manchin. We are paying for all, the Federal 
Government is paying to reimburse those who were led to believe 
this is safe and secure and it is cheaper.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. That is exactly right. I think we 
have decided that this equipment is insecure----
    Senator Manchin. And so would you----
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel [continuing]. And we need to take it 
out at all costs. And the smallest carriers have it in their 
networks with the least resources and the fewest companies--and 
the fewest customers.
    Senator Manchin. Okay.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. So Congress set aside funding for 
it but those funds are not sufficient to fully fund 
reimbursement.
    Senator Manchin. Madam Chairwoman, then talk to me about 
your FCC's budget for 2024.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Yes. Our budget maintains----
    Senator Manchin. Is it in there? Is your request in there?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Our request is not part of our 
budget. That funding was set aside in the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act, Division J, Title IV.
    Senator Manchin. The reason I am saying that this is -- 
everything we are talking about is extremely important. That 
was one of the most offensive things that we had found out 
about all the different users that we had using something that 
could be detrimental to all of us and our security.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Yes.
    Senator Manchin. So to me, that would be a high priority. 
That I think if you don't identify it, I can guarantee you, 
they won't come forward and just say: Oh, yes, we still think 
that is needed. But it must not be your highest priority 
because it is not in your budget request.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Well, we have--I have written to 
Members of Congress on this on five or six different separate 
occasions asking to be able to have this funding made 
available. So we have made it a priority, and we are working 
with the carriers that have it in their networks right now to 
try to identify what our funding stream options are.
    Senator Manchin. What are your highest priorities right now 
within your budget request; as far as the mission of the FCC?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. I think we have got to make sure 
that we figure out a way to get broadband to everyone in this 
country. We have got to make sure that our maps can actually be 
accurate and help with that process. We got to make sure that 
wireless services reach everyone and that we get our spectrum 
authorities back.
    Senator Manchin. How do you, how do you in rural areas such 
as mine, in Louisiana, and Tennessee, and on, and on, and 
Maryland even has some rural areas that I am very familiar 
with, how do we make sure that the carriers who have exclusive 
rights in those areas, who have had rights, and have told us 
everything in the maps would have been totally erroneous, or 
maps when they protect their territory? How can we make sure 
that they are doing what is needed?
    I had a person call me today, one-half mile from where 
Frontier was going eight homes down over, and they won't come. 
How can it be----
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Yes. No, we hear stories like that 
all the time.
    Senator Manchin. Yes.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. What we are trying to do with our 
maps, and this is a process, it is not something that happens 
overnight, as we build the kind of database where consumers, 
States, and municipalities can come to us and say: This 
information's not right. I live here, and in my own backyard, 
let me tell you, you have got it wrong. And what the carriers 
are telling you isn't right.
    And I think you know we have been working with the West 
Virginia Broadband Office to do a lot of that work, and a lot 
of State broadband offices have really stepped up to help us 
understand where our data is right and where it is wrong. And I 
just got to tell you, we are going to have to commit to that 
process for the long haul to make sure that things like those 
BEAD monies that are being spent right now get spent in the 
right places.
    Senator Manchin. Do you have enough resources to do the 
mapping and making sure the maps are accurate and followed as 
we designed?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. We do right now, but in the next 
fiscal year we will have to ask for an additional appropriation 
to keep those maps up and running, and continue to improve 
them.
    Senator Manchin. My recommendation would be, based on what 
we talked, with the Huaweis, and all the concerns we had, that 
we just mentioned, that that be a high priority of yours to ask 
in your budget?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Yes.
    Senator Manchin. And so for the additional background on 
this because just in common sense, I tell people back home, and 
they remember their grandparents, or great-grandparents talking 
about when they had no electricity, in 1936 we had the rural 
broadband electrification. I could never figure how we got into 
so many hollers and up so many creeks and everything else. I 
never could figure it out. And then I heard about co-ops.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Yes.
    Senator Manchin. And it was people who didn't basically 
look at anything except the service they needed, and they 
gathered as a co-op and was able to take it the lowest cost. Is 
that type of a model still available for broadband when we 
can't get the big guys to go because they say, well it is not--
there is no return on investment, so why are you forcing me to 
go up this hollers, or down this road here, and there is only 
five people?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. I think we have a perfect analog 
with the Rural Electrification Act. I mean, there was a time 
where we thought we could only bring electricity to the cities; 
you weren't going to turn the lights on in parts of rural West 
Virginia.
    Senator Manchin. There is not that many rural co-ops still 
left.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. And what we did was we mapped where 
electricity was and was not, and then we identified where 
commercial actors could take it, and where commercial actors 
wouldn't take it, we developed public-private partnerships to 
deploy in those communities.
    Senator Manchin. So we can go--we can identify some areas 
ourselves where they are just, they just cannot get service. I 
mean, I am sure that John, I am sure that all of us here have 
that same problem, and if we can identify that to where you 
will assist and help them put a collective together?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Absolutely. What you have to be 
mindful of, is some State laws prevent some of those municipal 
deployments, and you need to make sure that the State 
legislature does not stop those activities from happening. But 
you know history shows that when we didn't have barns, or 
roads, or bridges, we came together as communities to build 
them.
    Senator Manchin. Sure.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. This, to me, feels exactly the 
same.
    Senator Manchin. Well, we have got one shot, because you 
have put a lot of money on it right, and if we don't follow 
through we will not have it.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. You are right. The BEAD Program is 
a-once-in-a-lifetime kind of effort.
    Senator Manchin. Thank you.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, thank you, Senator Manchin.
    And as the Chair Rosenworcel said, in some of these areas 
and, you know, because we have had conversations in Western 
Maryland; in some of the areas there has been local resistance 
to allowing a municipality, for example, to simply, you know, 
start their own broadband service, if there is no other 
provider, and some State laws preempt it, but I look forward to 
working with you on that.
    Let me just say with respect to Rip and Replace, right, 
this was our effort to improve the security of our own 
networks, there were a number of networks around the country 
that had ZTE and Huawei, part of it. As part of the 2021 
Omnibus, we collectively, Congress provided $1.9 billion in 
mandatory funding to rip and replace those funds. So it has 
never been part of the baseline, it was considered a one-time 
expenditure. It was not enough. So my understanding, and 
correct me if I am wrong Madam--Chair Rosenworcel, is that it 
requires another approximately $3 billion to finish the job; is 
that right?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. That is correct.
    Senator Van Hollen. And we are hoping that that might be 
included as part of an effort to extend the--your authority 
when it comes to--you know, when it comes to the sales, leasing 
of the spectrum.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. That is right.
    Senator Manchin. Mr. Chairman, can I just follow up on?
    Senator Van Hollen. Yes.
    Senator Manchin. Is that only for domestic?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Yes.
    Senator Manchin. Rip and Replace is just for a domestic?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Just for carriers in the United 
States.
    Senator Manchin. The United States, because we have an 
awful lot of our allies who really follow----
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Absolutely; but only carriers in 
the United States, yes.
    Senator Manchin. Got you.
    Senator Van Hollen. Let me turn quickly to the question of 
robocalls. And we are obviously going to do another round of 
questions for any members who are interested.
    Robocalls are obviously a constant challenge for consumers, 
and it is always a bit of a cat and mouse game, trying to keep 
one step ahead of the robocallers who are violating the law. So 
if you could speak to two things, one the challenge of 
collecting fines that have been leveled against violators and 
whether we can be helpful in any way, or whether they are sort 
of fly-by-night operations.
    The second as you mentioned in your testimony the need for 
Congress to help you fill a loophole in the law, my 
understanding is there has been a recent lawsuit, and maybe 
current law does not cover texting. So if you could cover those 
two issues.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Sure. Robocalls are annoying, 
robotexts are irritating. We need to do everything we can to 
stop them. We have deployed new technology like STIR/SHAKEN. We 
have got a Trace Back Consortium working on it. I have now got 
partnerships with 47 of our State Attorneys General to work 
with them on this issue. We have issued cease-and-desist 
letters; we are doing new things, new tools. But there are two 
gaping loopholes that I see.
    The first is a Supreme Court decision in 2021 decided to 
freeze the definition of auto-dialer in the early 1990s, and as 
a result, there are a whole lot of scam artists out there who 
can evade our authority in the Telephone Consumer Protection 
Act. We would like to update that definition so that we can 
enforce the law against them.
    And second, we have issued more than $700 million in fines 
against robocallers and robotexters since I have been at the 
helm of the agency, but I can't take them to court and go 
collect that money. I have to hand that off to the Department 
of Justice, and I am sure they have got lots of other 
priorities. And I am sure many of those companies are fly-by-
night, and collecting those fines may not be easy. But I still 
would like the authority to do it, because I have to do 
everything we can to hold those folks to account if we want 
this effort of enforcement to be successful.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, speaking for myself, I would like 
to help you on both counts there, and maybe we can work with 
your team. The second part, which is giving the FCC the 
authority to directly go to court to collect the fees, do you 
have any estimate of what that would require in terms of 
additional resources?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. I suspect the consent of the 
Department of Justice, and that might prove more challenging in 
identifying the resources, but I just feel like we have got to 
hold some of these folks accountable, and issuing fines, and 
letting them disappear is not the way to do it.
    Senator Van Hollen. Absolutely. But as you know, there are 
other Federal agencies that do have the authority to bring 
lawsuits, and they develop sort of shared authorities----
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Right.
    Senator Van Hollen [continuing]. With the Department of 
Justice, so if you don't have----
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Yes. And we are working----
    Senator Van Hollen [continuing]. The time or capacity to do 
this; maybe we should talk to them.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. And we have been working with State 
Attorneys General. We have had a lot of success working with 
the Ohio Attorney General on auto warranty scams; we have done 
some mortgage scams with the Florida Attorney General. Really, 
no matter where you are in this country, people are irritated 
by this. So we are trying to develop as many partnerships as we 
can to make sure these folks are held to account.
    Senator Van Hollen. Got it. And my last question really 
picks up on something that Senator Manchin raised and which I 
raised; all of us have raised; which is the mapping question.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Van Hollen. And as I said in my opening remarks, I 
think the FCC has made dramatic strides in improving the system 
by creating that feedback loop. But I am sure you are aware of 
the 2022 GAO Report that talked about the 15 Federal agencies 
administering broadband programs.
    Now, the BEAD Program is obviously a big one in the 
Department of Commerce, but there are many others. Can you talk 
to--discuss the effort and coordination? Because I can tell 
you, you know, in preparing for this hearing, in fact, one of 
the reasons we want to have the hearing was just as we sort of 
look through the chart of, you know, Department of Agriculture, 
FCC, Commerce, all of these agencies that are involved.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Yes.
    Senator Van Hollen. If you were going to recreate this, do 
you have any thoughts on how we design it, or how we can better 
coordinate with the existing programs?
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. You know, Senator, if I had a magic 
wand, I would make it simpler. I understand what you are 
describing. So what I have been trying to do at the agency is 
figure out how we can coordinate with as many of these actors 
as possible. I signed a memorandum of understanding with the 
Department of Commerce because they have a lot of programs like 
BEAD, and I signed a memorandum of understanding with the 
Department of Agriculture because the Rural Utility Service has 
a lot of programs.
    I also went to the Department of the Treasury because their 
Capital Projects Fund is loaning out a lot of money. So I went 
to the biggest actors and said: We are all going to share 
information and data.
    On top of that, I have developed something called the 
Broadband Funding Map using $10 million in direct 
appropriations set aside in the IIJA. It is not the map that 
gets all the attention, but I think going forward it should get 
more attention, because I am asking everyone who has a 
broadband program to file data with us about where they have 
given out grants, so that we have a map of the enforceable 
commitments around the country.
    To be clear, I have had a lot of positive feedback from the 
Department of Commerce; we coordinate well. I have got to work 
with some of the other agencies to get more information and 
more data from them, but it is starting to come in. And keeping 
these other agencies reporting to us about where their grants 
are going, where their dollars are headed, and what they are 
doing is a really important part of making sure that we don't 
overfund some areas and ignore others.
    And so that Broadband Funding Map, I think, is a very 
important tool for Congress and its oversight. But I am going 
to need all those other agencies to give me their data in a 
very specific format in order to ensure that tool is really 
valuable.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, if you can keep us posted, I am 
sure we have a shared interest in making sure you get full 
cooperation from the other agencies. Because as you said, one 
thing that--it is important is to have a map to know who has 
broadband connections, and who doesn't. It is also important to 
have a map of who is funding what and where, so we don't 
duplicate effort.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Right. Exactly.
    Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Hagerty. Yes. I think that is a great suggestion, 
Mr. Chair. And I certainly applaud your asking the question. 
And Chair Rosenworcel, I hope you will share even the interim 
data on this Broadband Funding Map with our teams. I would very 
much like to see just the data to date and what it is showing 
you, what it is telling you, where it might lead us as 
policymakers and appropriators.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Yes.
    Senator Hagerty. I would like to just come back to the 
topic of our allies for a moment. And I think you are working 
hard, you are working apace, you have even identified the cost 
of $3.08 billion, what it will take to rip and replace here, 
and try to get our networks secure. I think it is terribly 
important that we do it. I think it is also important that our 
allies do the same. And one of the most important aspects of 
our alliances around the world is our interoperability with our 
allies.
    That is constrained dramatically when we have systems that 
we can't trust on the other side. And I have seen a real gap, 
if you will, in terms of understanding amongst our allies, of 
what the threats are, what the concerns might be.
    And I am not certain what the vehicle would be, and it 
might take you a little longer than just this moment to think 
it through, but if there is a role that you could play in terms 
of putting together the information that would help persuade 
our allies of the urgency of doing exactly what you are trying 
to accomplish here, in terms of getting their networks secure 
so that we can share more information with them, and so that we 
will be more interoperable with them, I think would do us a 
great service. I would love to get your thoughts on that.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Yes. I think, and I have talked to 
national security authorities about this. I think that if we 
choose to take this equipment out of our networks and fully 
fund its replacement costs, we have to go tell everyone around 
the world that we chose to do that. The United States decided 
that this equipment was so insecure we needed to take it out, 
remove it, and we paid for it. I think that is a really 
powerful example. And when we do it, we need to share that with 
our allies around the world.
    And there are other countries that are working with us on 
this issue, not all of them. But I think it is also 
simultaneously important that we help build up a better market 
for network equipment in the United States, and in our allies, 
because we have gotten to a place where there is only a handful 
of network equipment providers in the world right now; some of 
the biggest come from China.
    We need to make sure that the equipment market is more 
diverse, and more competitive, and less costly. I think that 
will also benefit us and our, you know, political interest in 
making sure that secure equipment is here at home and also 
abroad.
    Senator Hagerty. Back in 2017, I asked for a chart that 
showed what an end-to-end non-China solution for 5G would look 
like. And we actually put flags on the chart; multiple nations 
are involved for us to get this done, and multiple 
opportunities, therefore, to cooperate, and the need to 
cooperate with those nations, in terms of their standards, the 
specs for those devices. It is a big opportunity and a big 
challenge at the same time.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel. Yes, we can't do this on our own. 
We have got to find like-minded nations and then work with 
others to make sure that this equipment, which isn't just about 
Communications networks, it is about the infrastructure that 
supports modern economies, is actually secure and not 
vulnerable to foreign actors who might eventually wish to do 
them harm.
    Senator Hagerty. Yes. I think the vulnerability is clear, 
and I very much appreciate your continued thinking on this. And 
if you see an opportunity for us to help support you in this 
effort, please know that we are all supportive of doing that. 
Thank you.
    Thanks, Mr. Chair.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Well, Chair Rosenworcel, so 
we have covered a lot of territory today.
    Thank you, Senator Hagerty, other members who were here.

                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    Senator Van Hollen. The hearing record will remain open for 
7 days, allowing Members to submit statements and/or questions 
for the record, which should be sent to the subcommittee by 
close of business Tuesday, September 25, 2023.

    [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but 
were submitted to the Internal Revenue Service for response 
subsequent to the hearing:]
         Questions Submitted to Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel
               Questions Submitted by Senator Joe Manchin
    Question. The IIJA established the BEAD program to expand high-
speed Internet access across the country, including my home state of 
West Virginia. The BEAD program requires that funding be allocated 
based on each state's proportion of unserved locations according to the 
National Broadband Map. For decades, the FCC was allowing Internet 
providers to draw the broadband maps and they were wildly inaccurate 
with grossly overstated coverage. I led the fight to fix the map, 
because without correcting these maps, West Virginia would never have 
received the resources necessary to address the lack of coverage.
    It is imperative that the map be accurate and accessible to the 
general public.
    In that vein, I secured report language accompanying the FY24 
Financial Service and General Government appropriations bill that would 
direct the FCC to work with other agencies, including NTIA and USDA, to 
develop broadband maps that display eligibility for broadband 
deployment programs designed to expand broadband access and close the 
digital divide, particularly in rural areas.
    I also secured report language that would ask the FCC to address 
any ongoing accuracy issues with the National Broadband Map. What is 
your plan to continue the important work of improving the National 
Broadband Map?

    Answer. I understand how vital it is for the Commission to work to 
continually improve the accuracy of the National Broadband Map. This 
map is an important tool to help close the digital divide because it 
identifies, like no other data collection before it, where broadband is 
and is not all across the country. Moreover, this map is being used to 
inform broadband funding decisions at both the Federal and state level, 
including for the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program at the 
Department of Commerce.
    The Broadband DATA Act is the law that governs the agency's data 
collections that are used to assemble the National Broadband Map on a 
biannual basis. This process is designed to be iterative, with each new 
version of the map providing a more accurate and up-to-date picture of 
where broadband services are nationwide.
    Twice a year the agency releases an updated broadband Fabric, which 
is a database of all broadband serviceable locations in the United 
States. The Fabric is developed using hundreds of data sources, 
including tax records, property records, parcel boundary records, and 
satellite building imagery.
    Following the release of each updated Fabric, providers are 
required to supply information about the service they provide at each 
broadband serviceable location. The combination of this information and 
the Fabric database leads to the production of each map.
    Our next map issued using this process will be released in November 
and will reflect provider-reported availability data as of June 30, 
2023. It will be our third map issued pursuant to the Broadband DATA 
Act.
    We will continue using all the tools available to the Commission to 
update and improve the map, including: improvements to the underlying 
data used to identify broadband serviceable locations on the Fabric, 
collecting updated broadband availability data every 6 months, 
processing challenges to the Fabric and broadband availability data 
shown on the map, and validating the data providers are filing.
    Our current version of the Fabric includes over 115 million 
locations where fixed broadband could be installed. This reflects 
steady improvement in the Fabric since it was initially released in 
June of 2022. Working with our vendor CostQuest, over one million 
additional broadband serviceable locations have been added to the map 
since the November 2022 pre-production map, and the November 2023 map 
will add over 800,000 additional locations nationwide.
    These additional locations are primarily the result of our work 
with our vendor to update and improve the Fabric by refining the models 
and processes for creating the Fabric and using updated and improved 
input data sources such as new parcel data. The current version of the 
Fabric also incorporates millions of adjustments to the data associated 
with locations that were already included in earlier versions of the 
Fabric, including, for example, changes to address fields, unit counts, 
secondary addresses, broadband serviceable location status, and 
building and land use codes. Stakeholders--including municipalities, 
states, Tribes and individual consumers--are also helping to improve 
the Fabric through the challenge process. Over 1.5 million Fabric 
challenges have been accepted and incorporated into the Fabric itself. 
These challenges have helped identify missing locations and correct 
addresses and other information associated with the broadband 
serviceable locations included in the Fabric. Going forward, these 
efforts to improve the Fabric will continue to be a critical tool for 
improvement of the National Broadband Map.
    In addition to our continuing efforts to improve the Fabric, we are 
also focused on making use of the tools provided in the Broadband DATA 
Act to ensure that the availability data shown on the map are as 
accurate as possible.
    When providers submit data there are several steps the Commission 
takes to ensure as accurate-as-possible reporting, including automated 
system validations, informal and formal data verification efforts, 
audits, and when warranted enforcement referrals. The FCC has built 
automated error and anomaly detection and data cross-checks into the 
Broadband Data Collection system to validate submissions from Internet 
providers. Some require the provider to make a correction before the 
submission is accepted and others are reviewed by FCC staff.
    To date, FCC staff have initiated over 900 verification inquiries. 
This has resulted in updates to over 600 submissions from providers and 
a clearer picture of broadband availability in every state and 
territory. The agency is also conducting audits of reported mobile 
coverage in a number of states.
    In addition to audits and verifications, the Commission has also 
engaged directly with providers to offer technical assistance and 
support ensuring that the availability data that is reported is of 
sufficient quality. This outreach includes webinars, tutorials, 
standing up a technical assistance help desk, and one-on-one meetings 
with staff.
    Another important tool is the availability challenge process. It 
has resulted in our mapping team processing over 4.8 million challenges 
to provider reported availability data since the release of our first 
pre-production map in November 2022. These challenges have already 
yielded important changes in the map data and I anticipate that, over 
time, the challenge process will continue to serve as an important tool 
for correcting inaccuracies in provide reported data on the map.
    Finally, the Broadband Data Act also gives the FCC authority to 
take enforcement actions to address situations where a provider 
``willfully, and knowingly, or recklessly'' submits ``materially 
inaccurate or incomplete'' availability information. While I cannot 
provide information about specific enforcement referrals as these are 
ongoing law enforcement investigations, I can confirm that we have 
ongoing enforcement investigations. Moreover, I want to be clear that 
we will not hesitate to use this process when warranted, including 
against providers that have failed to report data or falsified data.

    Question. How do you ensure the National Broadband Map is accurate?

    Answer. The National Broadband Map is designed to be iterative--and 
consistently improving. To ensure these improvements are featured on 
the map, the Commission uses a number of tools to prevent, identify, 
and address inaccuracies and anomalies in both the fabric database and 
broadband availability data submitted by providers.
    The Fabric is an evolving dataset of all broadband serviceable 
locations in the United States that will need to change as new 
locations come online. Substantial improvements have been made to the 
Fabric since its first pre-production release in November 2022, and it 
continues to improve with each release.
    With respect to the Fabric, the Commission uses a number of 
practices to ensure it is as accurate as possible. Following each new 
Fabric release, the FCC's contractor, CostQuest, continues to refine 
and update its models, gain access to new and improved data sources 
used to identify broadband serviceable locations, such as new 
construction data, and makes other updates to the locations on the 
Fabric based on stakeholder feedback both through the challenge process 
and direct engagement.
    We have acknowledged that there were a few discrete instances where 
the data in the initial release of the Fabric did not meet our 
expectations. The known instances correspond to areas in the United 
States where the underlying datasets used to create the Fabric (parcel 
data, tax assessor data, high-resolution imagery data) were either 
outdated or simply not available. To improve the Fabric data in these 
areas, the FCC and our contractor, CostQuest, have invested significant 
resources since the release of the first version of the Fabric to 
undertake manual review above and beyond the baseline methodology to 
identify additional broadband serviceable locations in these areas.
    In addition, the FCC has developed a robust Fabric location 
challenge process through which stakeholders can raise location 
specific issues, such as missing locations, misidentified locations 
(i.e., a house incorrectly labeled as a large business), incorrect 
location information including address or unit count, and incorrect 
location placement on the map. Once submitted, the FCC and its vendor 
review the submissions using a series of geospatial checks and 
ultimately visual verification of satellite and fly over imagery for 
certain challenge types. Location changes resulting from a challenge 
are reflected in the next Fabric release.
    Stakeholders including states, local and tribal governments and 
consumers have submitted over 1.5 million challenges which been 
accepted and incorporated into the Fabric to date. We continue to 
accept both bulk and individual location challenges on a rolling basis. 
The FCC has taken a number of steps to inform and engage stakeholders 
in the Fabric challenge process, including holding webinars and 
workshops, and releasing outreach and technical assistance materials.
    With respect to availability data, the Commission is also using 
every tool available to ensure the information is as accurate as 
possible. For starters, Commission staff provide technical assistance 
and support to providers to assist with the correct filing of data 
through webinars, tutorials, articles, a technical assistance help 
desk, and one-on-one meetings. The Commission also uses system 
validations, data verifications and audits, enforcement actions and a 
challenge process to ensure the availability data on the map is as 
accurate as possible.
    The system providers use to submit availability data features a 
validation process, is designed to recognize patterns that suggest a 
problem with the underlying information provided to the agency. This 
has resulted in over 900 verification inquiries from Commission staff, 
followed by updates to more than 600 submissions from providers. These 
informal and formal verifications play an important role in ensuring 
the map is accurate. The FCC has also been using the audit tools 
provided in the DATA Act to verify the accuracy of mobile coverage data 
in a number of states. Providers are also required to certify the 
accuracy of their submissions to the agency. This facilitates our 
ability to refer matters for investigation and enforcement where 
appropriate, something we have not hesitated to do.
    One of the most important tools we have for ensuring the accuracy 
of broadband availability data is the challenge process laid out in the 
Broadband DATA Act. We accept challenges to availability data shown on 
the map on a rolling basis and update the map to reflect the results of 
these challenges. These challenges can be filed individually through 
the user-friendly map interface, or as bulk submissions into the BDC 
filing system. These processes allow those in the best position to know 
the accuracy of the data, consumers and other local stakeholders to 
help verify the accuracy of availability data on the map.
    To date, our mapping team has processed over 4.8 million challenges 
to provider reported availability data. These challenge can be 
submitted by individuals, state, local and Tribal governments and other 
entities. When a challenge is filed, FCC staff reviews the challenge to 
ensure it aligns with reason code selected for the challenge and then 
forwards accepted challenges to the provider for its response. 
Providers have 60 days to either concede or dispute the challenge. If 
the challenger and provider don't agree on the actual availability of 
the service reported at the location in questions it goes to the FCC 
for adjudication. Conceded challenges and those adjudicated in the 
challenger's favor result in corrections to the data shown on the map.
    West Virginia is a good example of how participation in the 
challenge processes and working in partnership with the FCC can yield 
important improvements to the accuracy of the data reflected in the 
National Broadband Map. The West Virginia State Broadband office filed 
both location and availability challenges and worked closely with FCC 
staff to identify discrete concerns that may warrant FCC verification. 
This back-and-forth helped contribute to an increase of 86,860 unserved 
locations in West Virginia between the release of our pre-production 
draft in November 2022 and the data used by the Department of Commerce 
for its allocation in the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment 
program.
    Given the importance of stakeholder participation in the challenge 
processes in refining the data depicted on the map and ensuring that 
the map is as accurate as possible, we have conducted extensive 
outreach to state, local, and Tribal governmental entities, service 
providers, and others to inform stakeholders about how they can 
participate in the process. Commission staff have held hundreds of 
meetings with congressional offices, service providers, public interest 
groups, and governmental entities across the nation to be sure we are 
offering support and technical assistance throughout this process. The 
Commission continues to conduct outreach meetings in person and 
virtually as well as produce guidance and educational materials on an 
ongoing basis as we work with stakeholders to improve the accuracy of 
the data on the National Broadband Map.

    Question. As a follow up, NTIA relies heavily on the FCC National 
Broadband Map to implement the BEAD program. As Federal investments in 
broadband move into full swing in states like West Virginia--which is 
the second least-served state in the country--we need to ensure we have 
the most up-to-date FCC map. Needless to say, the National Broadband 
Map has a significant impact on the BEAD program.
    Do we have adequate resources to support the National Broadband 
Map, and if not, do you have plans to ask the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) for additional funding next fiscal year?

    Answer. The Commission currently has funding sufficient to support 
the National Broadband Map through Fiscal Year 2024. However, it does 
not have funding adequate to support the map beyond Fiscal Year 2024. 
That is why we are requesting funding resources in our regular budget 
for Fiscal Year 2025.
    By way of background, it is important to know that in the Fiscal 
Year 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act (Public Law 116-260), the 
Commission received $98 million in funding for the start-up and 
implementation of the Broadband DATA Act (Public Law 116-130). Congress 
provided funding in two distinct sections of the Fiscal Year 2021 
Consolidated Appropriations Act. The first $33 million Congress 
provided was in the Commission's regular appropriation and derived from 
regulatory fees (Division E, Title V, 134 STAT 1408). Congress later 
provided an additional $65 million in direct appropriations under 
Division N, Section 906 to ensure ongoing implementation of the newly 
established mapping effort (134 STAT. 2144).
    In light of this, on February 17, 2021, I established a Broadband 
Data Task Force to use this funding and lead a cross-agency effort to 
implement the Broadband DATA Act.
    The resulting maps are, consistent with the law, designed to be 
refined through an iterative process. That is why the agency developed 
systems that allow for the steady collection and integration of new 
data and the release of new maps. Providers are required to submit 
updated availability data twice a year, and the fabric underlying the 
maps is also refreshed twice a year to reflect broadband serviceable 
location updates. Ongoing map updates remain essential at this juncture 
and this data is being used to inform the agency's universal service 
funding decisions.
    To date, the Commission has carefully managed the mapping program 
to ensure that it provides data that is as accurate as possible under 
the law in light of the limited appropriated funds. However, the agency 
is now facing ``out years'' beyond the initial program start and 
implementation period. That is why the initial Fiscal Year 2021 
investment will need to be replenished in Fiscal Year 2025 and on an 
ongoing basis until such time when Congress determines that mapping is 
no longer needed. I want to be clear, however, that I think that having 
this tool is essential, especially right now, as we work to address the 
gaps in deployment that contribute to the digital divide. That is why I 
have directed our management team to ask the Office of Management and 
Budget for additional funds for Fiscal Year 2025 that are within the 
range of the original funds provided as part of our fee-derived funding 
in Fiscal Year 2021.

    Question. The FCC established the 5G Fund for Rural America, which 
uses reverse auctions to distribute $9 billion to bring 5G broadband 
service to rural communities unlikely to otherwise see the deployment 
of 5G-capable networks.
    I understand that you've Noticed a Proposed Rulemaking that seeks 
to improve the implementation of the 5G Fund.
    The Notice says, ``In the 5G Fund Report and Order, the Commission 
decided that it would accept bids and identify winning bids in the 5G 
Fund auctions using a support price per adjusted square kilometer.'' 
And would factor in such things as terrain and elevation.
    Considering that lower bids win in reverse auctions, this may be a 
reason why West Virginia is not getting its fair share of funding 
compared to a flatter state, since it is more expensive to build a 
tower that will be blocked on one side by a mountain.
    What is your approach to accounting for terrain and elevation when 
accepting and identifying winning bids?

    Answer. The 5G Fund was first proposed in 2020 as a way to 
modernize the Commission's universal service support system for 
wireless carriers serving rural and high-cost areas of the country. At 
that time the agency decided that it would assess bids in an auction on 
the basis of support price per adjusted square kilometer. This 
methodology featured the use of an adjustment factor designed to take 
characteristics like terrain, elevation, and population density into 
account.
    I believe we should update this approach. For the first time in our 
history, thanks to our new mapping initiatives, we have comprehensive 
data regarding the state of wireless service all across the country. We 
now know, for instance, that over 14 million homes and businesses 
nationwide--including over 360,000 in West Virginia--do not have mobile 
5G wireless coverage today. On top of this, the pandemic has changed 
our thinking about where we live, work, and travel, expanding our 
expectations for wireless service nationwide.
    It is imperative that as we move forward with the 5G Fund, we take 
these facts into account. That is why I believe we need to expand our 
thinking beyond what was first proposed for the 5G Fund in 2020. To 
this end, on September 21, 2023, the Commission began a rulemaking to 
consider new ways to administer this program. Specifically, the agency 
sought comment on how to best incorporate the use of mapping data in 
the 5G Fund, in light of the clear gaps it demonstrates in coverage. We 
seek comment on how to do so in light of the methodology that was 
adopted when the 5G Fund was first introduced, including through 
changes to the adjustment factor. I am looking forward to the record 
that we receive in response to this rulemaking. I am hopeful that we 
can modernize our approach so that we both appropriately account for 
areas that are costly to serve, including for topological reasons, and 
ensure we reach those locations that our mapping data indicate are 
without service today.

            Questions Submitted by Senator Chris Van Hollen
    Question. I want to bolster the Commission's efforts to stop scam 
robocalls and robotexts. In 1991, Congress passed the Telephone 
Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) to tackle the rising issue of 
unsolicited telemarketing calls or robocalls. The TCPA generally 
restricts the use of certain automated telephone equipment for making 
calls to consumers without prior consent. In the preceding years, the 
Commission has established regulations under the TCPA to ensure that 
emerging technologies fall under its protective umbrella, such as 
extending the consent requirement to text messages made using an 
autodialer. In a 2021 case interpreting the TCPA, Facebook, Inc. v. 
Duguid, the Supreme Court adopted a narrow interpretation of the class 
of equipment typically considered autodialers, potentially reducing the 
number of text messages for which prior consumer consent is required.
    Commission data show that consumers receive increasing numbers of 
illegal and unwanted text messages, and the problem worsens yearly. Are 
there limitations on your authority to address robotexts, to implement 
anti-robotexting rules, or to collect enforcement remedies that 
Congress can address? If so, please indicate what additional 
authorities you need to address this issue.

    Answer. There are at least three additional ways that Congress 
could grant the FCC authority to better address the increasing number 
of illegal and unwanted text messages.
    First, Congress could update the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. 
The TCPA's definition of ``automatic telephone dialing system'' has 
been unaltered since 1991, despite many changes in technology during 
the intervening years. Moreover, the Supreme Court's 2021 decision in 
Facebook v. Duguid narrowed the definition of automatic telephone 
dialing system, as a practical matter limiting it only to those systems 
with a random or sequential number generator. This decision makes it 
harder for the agency to ensure the protections in this law cover how 
many scam artists now use technology to reach us with junk calls and 
texts. To address this loophole, Congress could expand the TCPA's 
definition of ``automatic telephone dialing system'' to specify that it 
includes calls made from a stored list of numbers. Congress could also 
amend the TCPA, and specifically Section 227(b)(1)(A) of the 
Communications Act, to specify that it is unlawful to send robotexts 
under this section. The Commission has, since 2003, taken the position 
that the term ``call'' in Section 227(b)(1)(A) includes both voice 
calls and text messages and courts have supported this determination. 
See, e.g., Satterfield v. Simon & Schuster, Inc., 569 F.3d 946, 954 
(9th Cir. 2009). Nonetheless, I believe that legislation to make that 
explicit would bolster the Commission's ability to protect consumers 
from unwanted robotexts.
    Second, I believe it would be beneficial for Congress to provide 
the Commission with the authority to collect the fines we impose 
against the bad actors responsible for illegal robocalls and robotexts. 
Right now, our enforcement work ends when we issue a forfeiture order 
because we lack the authority to pursue collection in court without the 
Department of Justice. To put this in context, note that in the last 
year alone, the agency has finalized more than $500 million in fines 
for illegal robocalls but lacks the ability to even try to collect 
these funds in court.
    Third, the Commission could benefit from authority to access Bank 
Secrecy Act information in order to help identify more quickly the 
financial records of our calling targets without giving those targets 
suspected of scams a heads up that we are coming for them. We are 
currently engaged in discussions with the Department of Treasury to 
acquire the access to this information. If we are able to access this 
information, it would allow the Commission to obtain evidence that can 
help identify who is actually responsible for illegal robocall 
campaigns, and to prevent scam artists from registering new entities 
under new names after enforcement actions shut them down.

    Question. Our commitment to the universal service principle, 
ensuring that all Americans have access to essential communication 
services, is currently facing a serious test. The Communications Act, 
which established the FCC, firmly laid down this principle. However, 
the funding for two highly successful programs that play a crucial role 
in bridging the digital divide and ensuring affordable broadband access 
for all Americans will be depleted within months. The first of these 
programs, the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), offers financial 
assistance for broadband access to over 20 million working families. 
The second program, the Emergency Connectivity Fund (ECF), has provided 
invaluable support to more than 18 million students and library 
patrons, enabling them to access Internet connections and devices vital 
for their education and information needs.
    Numerous constituencies have sounded the alarm about this impending 
funding crisis. The Universal Service Fund (USF) has historically 
played a pivotal role in extending telecommunication services to 
underserved areas, paid for by fees collected from telecommunications 
carriers rather than direct appropriations. Could the Commission 
leverage the USF model, which underpins several vital initiatives, 
including Lifeline, the E-rate program, rural health delivery, and the 
expansion of rural broadband infrastructure, to fund the ACP and ECF, 
as some have suggested, without significantly increasing fees on 
consumers?

    Answer. The Affordable Connectivity Program is the Nation's 
largest-ever broadband affordability effort. Today, it is responsible 
for helping more than 21 million households get online and stay online. 
Based on our current projections, we expect that existing funding for 
the ACP from Congress will run out in April of 2024. Without additional 
funding, these ACP households are at risk of losing access to high-
speed Internet service. Cutting them off will also cut off access to 
work, education, and healthcare opportunities that are now online.
    For this reason, I have consistently stressed that the agency will 
need additional ACP funding. To address the emergency need for funds in 
the immediate future, the Administration recently proposed $6 billion 
in direct, supplemental funding for ACP. This request would provide the 
agency with funding to continue to program through the end of 2024, 
with some potential program changes.
    To be clear, additional congressional funding is the only path 
forward for the ACP in the immediate term. If Congress does not provide 
this additional funding, the FCC would be able to simply leverage the 
Universal Service Fund to support ACP. To do this successfully would 
require legislative action and significant time to resolve complex 
legal and administrative issues, including the fact that many ACP 
providers are not eligible to participate in traditional universal 
service programs and many ACP households are not eligible to 
participate in the FCC's traditional universal service low-income 
program--leading to substantial fall out of providers and customers. 
Even if these issues could be resolved through legislation, relying on 
the Universal Service Fund for ACP would more than double the size of 
this fund. Our current estimates suggest that this would triple the 
contribution factor--which in turn impacts the assessment that 
consumers pay into this fund on their bill. In practice, this would 
mean an additional increase of at least $6 to $10 on the monthly 
communications service bill of consumers in this country.

                                 ______
                                 
              Questions Submitted by Senator John Boozman
    Question. What is the FCC's plan to continue the Affordable 
Connectivity Program (ACP), absent Congressional action, in light of 
funding running out?

    Answer. When Congress tasked the Commission with developing the 
Affordable Connectivity Program it also provided an appropriation of 
$14.2 billion. Today, these funds support more than 21 million 
households that count on ACP to get online, including over 200,000 
households in Arkansas. To ensure that these households can continue to 
count on ACP for high-speed Internet access, the Administration 
recently requested that Congress provide an additional $6 billion in 
funding for ACP. In fact, our current estimate is that the initial 
appropriation of $14.2 billion will expire in April of 2024, which may 
result in millions of these households losing access to the Internet. 
So without further funding from Congress, this program is in jeopardy.

    Question. What is the FCC doing to communicate the possible 
upcoming changes to the ACP, including a lapse in funding, with 
consumers so that they aren't surprised by a sudden price increase or 
loss of service?

    Answer. The Commission fully recognizes the importance of 
communicating with participating households and providers about any 
changes to the Affordable Connectivity Program. However, it would be 
premature to communicate about potential program changes while 
discussions concerning additional funding for the ACP are ongoing. As 
noted above, the Administration has requested that Congress provide an 
additional $6 billion in funding for the ACP and the FCC remains 
hopeful that Congress will provide this additional funding. However, if 
Congress does not provide further funding for the ACP, staring early 
next year the Commission will provide guidance to both consumers and 
providers about the end of the program in order to prevent unexpected 
price increases or loss of service.

    Question. On March 29 of this year, I joined a bipartisan letter 
with 27 of my Senate colleagues asking the FCC to engage proactively in 
the ongoing ATSC 3.0 broadcast television transition. I have been 
pleased to see that the Commission announced the formulation of a task 
force and have been informed that the Commission has started to work on 
various rulemakings that would help lay the groundwork for a successful 
transition. Could you provide an update on where those rulemakings 
stand as well as how the task force meetings are progressing?

    Answer. The Commission is committed to helping with the rollout of 
next generation television based on the ATSC 3.0 standard and ensuring 
when this occurs consumers are protected from service disruption, 
service loss, and being saddled with the cost of expensive new 
equipment to maintain television service. To this end, the agency has 
worked with the National Association of Broadcasters in a public-
private effort known as the Future of Television Initiative. This 
initiative features a broad group of stakeholders working through 
challenging matters associated with the transition--both from an 
industry and consumer perspective--with an eye to creating a roadmap 
for a transition that serves the public interest. While this work is 
still in its early stages, we have appreciated the way this forum is 
facilitating discussion on major issues, including the conditions 
needed to complete the transition, what the post-transition landscape 
should look like, and challenges presented by the lack of backwards 
compatibility of equipment for consumers.
    This last point is an especially important one, because while ATSC 
3.0 has the potential to create new business opportunities for 
broadcasters, it is vital that we think upfront about what the 
transition means for consumers. To be clear, there are potential 
benefits for consumers in this transition, including new services and a 
higher quality viewing experience. Nonetheless, the next generation 
television standard is not backward compatible, meaning it does not 
work with existing television sets or set-top boxes. While progress has 
been made with the expansion of ATSC 3.0 signal availability, with over 
60 percent of households nationwide having access to next generation 
television signals, most households lack equipment necessary to receive 
this service. Some manufacturers, however, have started to include ATSC 
3.0 tuners in their new mid-range and high-end sets, but options are 
limited and remain costly, especially for households that do not want 
to purchase a new set right now nor have the means to do so. This means 
we do not yet have a solution that works for all consumers and moving 
to the next standard right now would mean many of the most vulnerable 
consumers would lose access to service.
    In order to prevent consumers from losing access to their free, 
local broadcast television service and still allow broadcasters to take 
steps forward and innovate, many stations are broadcasting in a manner 
that reaches viewers with a signal using the existing standard (ATSC 
1.0) while on a strictly voluntary basis transitioning to ATSC 3.0. 
This approach minimizes viewer disruption, allowing those who have not 
replaced their television or purchased a special reception device for 
ATSC 3.0 service to continue to receive broadcast television service.
    In order to further minimize viewer disruption, the Commission has 
had a ``substantially similar'' requirement that ensures that any 
broadcaster providing a signal in ATSC 3.0 provide programming content 
stream that is substantially similar on their ATSC 1.0 signal. This 
requirement was slated to expire on July 17, 2023. However, on June 23, 
2023, the Commission acted to extend this deadline to July 17, 2027 and 
committed to review it 1 year in advance in order to reassess market 
conditions.
    On June 23, 2023, the Commission also initiated a rulemaking to 
further our understanding of the current marketplace for ATSC 3.0 
Standard Essential Patents and the ability of third parties to develop 
products that rely upon them as well as the impact on consumers if the 
Commission were to require these patent holders to commit to licensing 
them on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Comments received in 
response to this proceeding are currently under review.

    Question. What is the FCC doing to coordinate with state broadband 
offices to provide status updates (such as timelines, construction 
progress, which providers are behind in their plans or likely to 
default, etc.) on the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) program?

    Answer. The Commission recognizes the importance of keeping states 
informed about the Rural Digital Opportunities Fund. That is why the 
agency uses a variety of different measures to ensure that states 
receive updated information about carriers awarded funding under this 
program in their respective states. First, the FCC produces a Broadband 
Funding Map. This tool provides states with the ability to view areas 
where carriers have RDOF commitments and already provide service due to 
RDOF obligations. Second, the FCC is closely monitoring carrier 
progress and compliance with RDOF obligations and will notify state 
broadband offices when the agency learns that a carrier subject to an 
obligation does not intend to meet it in the state or otherwise falls 
short. Third, the FCC plans to ask carriers to directly engage with 
state broadband offices when they develop their state-specific 
challenge processes under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment 
program in order to keep state authorities fully apprised of existing 
deployment plans and the technologies they intend to use to meet their 
RDOF obligations. Fourth, in the event a carrier withdraws from RDOF, 
the FCC announces this in a public notice which it shares with both the 
Department of Commerce and relevant state broadband offices. On top of 
this, the Broadband Funding Map is updated to reflect any such 
withdrawal. Finally, the Commission staff is always open to inquiries 
from our state colleagues about any carrier and its participation in 
RDOF at any time.

                                 ______
                                 
              Questions Submitted by Senator Bill Hagerty
    Question. I have heard from constituents that the FCC is 
considering updating the rules surrounding spectrum to potentially 
facilitate new two-way wireless broadband services in the lower 12 GHz 
band. They tell me that updating these rules could help serve consumers 
in rural Tennessee by closing the digital divide.
    The FCC unanimously approved a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to 
consider how to best modernize the rules for 12 GHz band and 
potentially facilitate new two-way wireless broadband services, and I 
understand no final decision has been made.
    Chairwoman Rosenworcel, as the Commission explores options for 
transitioning to 5G, could you discuss your thoughts on new rules for 
fixed broadband in the lower 12 GHz band and a timeline on a looming 
decision?

    Answer. The Commission has identified more than 1000 megahertz of 
prime mid-band spectrum in the 12 GHz Band (12.2-13.25 GHz) for new and 
innovative uses. These are airwaves are right in the middle of the 7-16 
GHz band that we have identified as the sweet spot for the next 
generation of wireless technology--or 6G. We are the first country in 
the world to identify these bands for new wireless use and take action.
    I believe these airwaves can be optimized with a mix of licensed, 
unlicensed, and space-based services. The 12.7-13.25 GHz band is a 
prime candidate for new mobile use, so we are exploring how to put it 
in the pipeline for new wireless broadband, which is critical for 
United States wireless leadership.
    Meanwhile, the 12.2-12.7 GHz band presents an opportunity to allow 
new services to use the band efficiently while protecting incumbent 
satellite functions that millions of people in this country rely on 
every day. As a result, we are exploring how these airwaves can be used 
for fixed licensed and unlicensed terrestrial services, including two-
way point-to-multipoint links and other use cases that could, among 
other things, expand backhaul to support advanced broadband capacity.
    The deadline for comments on these proposals was in September. 
Commission staff is reviewing the record carefully with an eye to 
moving forward and opening up this band for new services.

    Question. Chairwoman Rosenworcel, as the debate around cable 
regulations and new streaming platforms continues to play out in the 
public arena, could you provide the Subcommittee an update on where the 
FCC stands?

    Answer. The video marketplace has changed significantly with the 
introduction of streaming services. There are so many new screens and 
new ways to watch programming. This is exciting for viewers who can 
consume content from near and far at virtually anytime and anyplace. At 
the same time, it is important to recognize that television 
broadcasting, which is uniquely local, should have the opportunity to 
thrive in this new landscape.
    The primary laws governing the distribution and carriage of 
broadcast television stations on multichannel video programming 
distributors (MVPDs) include the Cable Communications Policy Act of 
1984 and the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act 
of 1992. Both of these laws amend the Communications Act. Therefore, 
this remains the legal framework under which the Commission must assess 
all issues associated with MVPDs.
    When the Commission last attempted to address this matter, in a 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking adopted in 2014, the record revealed 
significant concerns with the agency asserting jurisdiction over MVPDs 
in a way that the statutory framework was not designed to support in 
1984 or 1992. To understand why, consider that Section 602(13) of the 
Communications Act defines an MVPD as an entity that ``makes available 
for purchase, by subscribers or customers, multiple channels of video 
programming.'' At the same time, Section 602(4) of the Communications 
Act defines a channel as ``a portion of the electromagnetic frequency 
spectrum which is used in a cable system and which is capable of 
delivering a television channel.'' It is imperative that the Commission 
give these words full meaning. As reflected in the record, online video 
programming distributors do not neatly fit in these statutory 
definitions because they lack a physical connection to subscribers and 
do not use any electromagnetic frequencies when delivering programming 
to their viewers. As you know, the Commission lacks the power to change 
these unambiguous provisions on its own but can do so if Congress 
changes the underlying law.
    In addition, the record demonstrated that even if the Commission 
were to proceed, it would require changes to underlying copyright 
policies. It is not clear if the Copyright Office would, with an 
altered Commission interpretation of the definition of MVPD, allow the 
current statutory copyright license to be used by online video 
programming distributors. As you know, the existing statutory copyright 
license works hand-in-hand with the retransmission consent policies in 
the Communications Act. What this means in practice is that the 
carriage of broadcast television station signals on traditional MVPDs 
can take place without negotiations with every single copyright holder 
associated with the station programming. Without a statutory copyright 
license applying to new online video programming distributors, those 
distributors would be obligated to black out programming for which they 
are not able to negotiate copyright licenses.
    Because we recognize that it is important that local broadcast 
stations have the ability to reach viewers where they are in this new 
media environment, the Commission is meeting with stakeholders to learn 
more. To this end, we understand that carriage via online video 
programming distributors is now the subject of private negotiations 
between local broadcast stations and their affiliated networks. We are 
monitoring these efforts, to better understand the consequences for 
carriage and consumers. We are also continuing to review the record 
from 2014 to identify outstanding issues.
