  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BILL JOHNSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
                CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO

    Well, again, good morning, and welcome to today's hearing 
titled ``Clean Power Plan 2.0: EPA's Latest Attack on America's 
Electric Reliability.''
    Since day one, President Biden has jeopardized America's 
energy security by pushing a whole-of-government climate agenda 
that increases energy costs, degrades energy reliability, and 
harms our economic and national security. At the forefront of 
this regulatory onslaught is the EPA's recent announcement 
proposing expensive and unproven greenhouse gas emissions 
standards on electric generating units, particularly coal and 
natural-gas-fired power generation, which alone make up 60 
percent of America's electric generation capacity.
    Under the Biden administration's Clean Power Plan, existing 
coal-fired generation must either, one, limit its capacity 
factor to 20 percent; cofire with 40 percent natural gas; or 
capture 90 percent of its carbon dioxide with carbon capture 
technology. Similarly, natural-gas-fired power generation must 
either, by varying dates, cofire with 30 percent clean hydrogen 
or install carbon capture and sequestration and cofire with 
over 90 percent clean hydrogen.
    Now, this sounds great, except the devil is in the details. 
These requirements on this timeline--and let me emphasize ``on 
this timeline''--experts tell us are infeasible and technically 
unattainable if the grid is to remain operational. That is a 
big problem, and I look forward to hearing more about this 
today.
    I do wonder, though: Is that by design?
    We are starting down a path to severe grid reliability 
challenges throughout the country. In fact, a case could be 
made that we are already there. Just a few months ago, the 
Nation's largest grid operator, the PJM Interconnection, whose 
service territory covers the entire State of Ohio, released a 
report noting it could face severe generation capacity 
shortfalls by 2030. The report specifically noted that existing 
EPA regulations, including the coal combustion residuals, the 
good neighbor rule, and the effluent limitation guidelines are 
all reasons for this potential capacity shortfall.
    Add all this new regulatory attack on baseload generation 
to that list. Even though the proposal is not finalized, it 
sends signals to the market that investing in new gas-fired 
power generation or keeping existing units operating through 
their service life is not economically feasible.
    In addition, the North American Electric Reliability 
Corporation, in its annual summer reliability assessment, 
warned that the vast majority of the country is at elevated 
risk of insufficient operating reserves during above-normal 
demand this summer--not 2030, this summer. Let me emphasize 
that.
    This isn't happening by accident. These electric 
reliability challenges are a direct result of onerous climate 
regulations favored by many congressional Democrats and the 
Biden administration. The Biden administration has no plans to 
ensure more reliable generation capacity is connected to the 
grid.
    Due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy, a 
megawatt of wind or solar is fundamentally not the same as a 
megawatt of coal, nuclear, or natural-gas-fired generation. 
That is science, folks, it is not--it is a fact. Yet the Biden 
EPA insists on regulating reliable sources of energy out of 
existence.
    The proposed regulation is another attempt by the 
environmental left to fundamentally change our Nation's 
electric generation portfolio. This is--this blatantly 
contradicts a State's right to choose its own electric 
generation mix, which is a core component of the Federal Power 
Act.
    We saw what happened last time they attempted to regulate 
natural gas and coal out of existence. In a landmark decision 
in West Virginia v. EPA, the Supreme Court found that such 
sweeping regulations by the Federal Government failed the major 
questions doctrine, which states that an action of major 
national importance must have explicit direction from Congress. 
EPA had no such authority then, and it has no such authority 
now to transform our electric sector.
    I am also concerned about the process by which this 
proposed regulation was developed. According to numerous 
reports, the EPA submitted an original proposal to the White 
House for review that did not include regulations on existing 
natural-gas-fired generation. But after the White House had a 
chance to review, the EPA reportedly revised the rule to put 
existing natural-gas-fired generation in their crosshairs.
    They took this extreme action in spite of the fact that 
natural gas makes up roughly 40 percent of our electric 
generation portfolio and is the primary driver behind emissions 
reductions in the electric power sector. This is further proof 
that this administration is interested in nothing else but 
decarbonization. Consumer costs and energy reliability and 
resilience are afterthoughts in their pursuit of a zero-carbon 
electric grid and a net-zero economy.
    Thank you to our witnesses for being here today, especially 
Mr. O'Loughlin and Mr. Snitchler, who hail from the Buckeye 
State.
    Thank you both for being here.
    I look forward to hearing from each of our witnesses on the 
harmful effects this proposed regulation will have on our 
energy sector reliability, resiliency, and affordability.

    Mr. Johnson. And with that, I yield back and I recognize 
the ranking member from New York, Mr. Tonko, for his opening 
statement.

   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PAUL TONKO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK

    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Chair Johnson, and thank you to our 
witnesses for attending today.
    Under the Clean Air Act, EPA has a responsibility and an 
obligation to protect Americans' public health and the 
environment from air pollution, and this does include carbon 
pollution.
    As we know, the power sector is the second-largest source 
of greenhouse gas emissions in our United States. Many of the 
coal-fired power plants that we will hear about today will have 
been operating for over 60 years by the time EPA's proposed 
rule would require them to take any compliance action. During 
those decades they have been able to emit limitless carbon 
pollution without consequences. Now, do my Republican 
colleagues truly believe these plants should continue to be 
able to pollute at these levels for as long as possible?
    Section 111 of the Clean Air Act allows the agency to 
establish standards of performance. Those standards are for new 
and existing electric generating units. EPA has successfully 
used this authority to reduce air pollution since the 1970s, 
and each time regulated entities have found cost-effective 
methods by which to comply with reasonable--and with reasonable 
standards. This proposed rule will be no different, but today I 
expect we will hear misrepresentations of what is included in 
the proposal and fearmongering about how it will jeopardize 
grid reliability.
    So I would like to be clear about what is actually in the 
proposed rule.
    First, the rule is reasonable. It is a far cry from a 
government takeover of our power sector. On the contrary, it is 
based on existing market trends, which include significant coal 
plant retirements for economic reasons and increased deployment 
of renewables. This is ultimately a modest rule that builds 
upon the Inflation Reduction Act, which will further support 
cost-effective compliance with the proposed standards.
    Second, this proposal provides ample flexibility to 
entities. The rule has proposed to regulate generating units by 
subcategories, taking into consideration a variety of factors 
such as the size of units, when units plan to retire, and just 
how often units intend to operate. It acknowledges that, 
depending on the date of retirement, the cost effectiveness of 
pollution controls will change.
    Therefore, units planning to shut down within the next 15 
years will need to take less stringent steps to comply, and 
some units will not need to do much of anything at all. This 
will avoid stranded assets from the installation of pollution 
controls on power plants that will not operate for long enough 
to make those investments recoverable.
    The proposal also allows for several pathways for 
compliance and does not dictate a specific type of pollution 
control strategy. Some units may choose to pursue carbon 
capture, others may adopt hydrogen cofiring, and it provides 
ample timelines by which they can strive for compliance, which 
will allow utilities and grid operators to make those long-term 
plans.
    Third, this proposal is targeted. The most stringent 
emissions controls will only be required on a small number of 
the largest and, indeed, most polluting power plants. These are 
disproportionate polluters: 28 percent of power sector 
emissions come from just 45 facilities that provide only 11 
percent of our Nation's power. This rule intends that the most 
polluting sources of carbon pollution take greater action to 
reduce that pollution, and it ensures that smaller units, which 
may have a role to play in grid balancing as we achieve a 
cleaner electricity mix, are able to continue to operate. For 
example, existing gas peaker plants, which do not run as often, 
will likely not be covered at all.
    Finally, I want to say a word on reliability. Despite this 
rule being incredibly different from the Obama administration's 
Clean Power Plan, many of the attacks against it remain 
unchanged. Back then we also heard scare tactics that the rule 
would threaten reliability. What happened instead? Before the 
rule would have even gone into effect, market trends enabled 
nearly every State to achieve the 2030 goals of the proposal. 
Just like then, today Members are vastly underestimating just 
how quickly our electricity system is becoming cleaner and how 
quickly pollution control technologies will become cheaper.
    Now, there certainly are steps Congress should take to 
strengthen the reliability of our electric grid. Unfortunately, 
our Republican colleagues missed a huge opportunity by failing 
to agree to any serious transmission policies as part of last 
week's debt ceiling agreement. We could have taken meaningful, 
commonsense steps to strengthen transmission connections 
between and amongst regions. This definitely would have 
enhanced grid resilience in the short term, as we face 
increasing numbers of extreme weather events, and the long 
term, as our electricity mix continues to change.
    Mr. Chair, I believe, despite what we will hear today, EPA 
has taken a sensible, flexible, targeted, and certainly 
achievable approach to reduce emission from some of the largest 
carbon polluters in our country. I do look forward to today's 
discussion. But more importantly, I look forward to EPA 
finalizing this proposal.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Tonko follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Tonko. And with that, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the Chair of the full Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, for 5 minutes for an opening 
statement.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS, A 
    REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to our 
witnesses.
    Energy is foundational to everything we do, and America's 
ability to harness it through innovation and entrepreneurship 
has completely transformed the human condition.
    Energy powers our economy, and it is why America is leading 
lifting people out of poverty and raising the standard of 
living. And we have achieved this while being the leader in 
emissions reduction and maintaining some of the highest 
environmental and labor standards in the world.
    In order to build on this remarkable legacy, we must 
continue to innovate and take advantage of our abundant natural 
resources for a diverse energy mix. Today, however, more and 
more people in America are being forced to face the threats of 
blackouts and brownouts. This is happening across the country. 
In California, rush-to-green policies are driving out baseload 
and dispatchable generation in exchange for less reliable 
weather-dependent substitutes. This crisis is playing out in 
Texas too, where overreliance on weather-dependent sources has 
limited its capacity to endure severe regional weather.
    Last year, the American--North American Reliability 
Corporation, NERC, warned that more than half the Nation was at 
an elevated risk of forced blackouts during the summer. This 
year NERC is projecting that number will be roughly two-thirds 
of the Nation.
    The reliability of our electric grid is essential to 
America's health and safety. Rushing to dismantle our Nation's 
electricity generation is not how we improve people's lives and 
well-being. Yet the EPA has sought to use the Clean Air Act to 
restructure the American power sector by shutting down coal-
fired power plants and shifting electricity generation to 
weather-dependent sources.
    These efforts to transform the Nation's electricity system 
would have damaging and lasting effects on reliability for 
Americans across the country and would go well beyond the EPA's 
congressionally mandated authority. The Supreme Court ruled 
just that in West Virginia v. EPA when it found that the EPA's 
efforts to circumvent Congress and restructure the U.S. power 
sector through the Clean Air Act were unconstitutional. Given 
the Court's ruling, the EPA must be completely transparent with 
the public about how its sweeping new rules would jeopardize 
the reliability of our electric grid and shut down our economy.
    This morning, the committee sent a letter to the EPA 
Administrator Regan demanding the agency extend its comment 
period for the proposed greenhouse gas and power plant rules. 
The EPA is setting a strict, costly, and untested standard on 
both new and existing natural gas generators and remaining coal 
generators, and the agency is doing it on an extremely fast 
compliance timeline. This is unacceptable. This complex 
proposal would affect the entire U.S. coal-generating fleet, 
all future natural gas power plants, as well as existing plants 
producing more than 300 megawatts of power. These changes will 
have a chilling effect on American natural gas, which is 
critical for generating electricity across the country. It will 
make life more expensive across the board.
    It is clear these profound changes sought by the EPA pose 
risk to the structure of our entire electric generation and 
energy mix. The comment period on the proposal should be 
extended to enable stakeholders time to evaluate and respond 
fully.
    In order to ensure the American people have access to 
affordable, reliable energy to keep them safe, fed, and warm, 
it is vital that we, the committee of jurisdiction, understand 
and take actions to address the EPA's proposals and what they 
mean for the Nation's electricity systems, as well as 
Americans--America's energy leadership. That is our goal today.
    And I thank the witnesses for being here, and I look 
forward to our discussion.

    Mrs. Rodgers. I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the full committee ranking member, Mr. Pallone, for 
5 minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, Jr., A REPRESENTATIVE 
            IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Chairman Johnson.
    Today we will be discussing the EPA's recently proposed new 
carbon pollution standards for fossil fuel power plants. This 
proposal is long overdue, and is critical to reducing dangerous 
air pollution, fighting the worsening climate crisis, and 
protecting communities across the Nation. It builds on the 
climate and public health investments President Biden and 
congressional Democrats made with the Inflation Reduction Act, 
and it is necessary now because the power sector is the second-
largest source of climate pollution in the United States, yet 
these power plants are still allowed to spew carbon pollution 
without any oversight.
    I think most Americans would be surprised to hear that 
right now there are no limitations on how much carbon pollution 
these power plants can emit. It simply defies logic when you 
consider that, week in and week out, communities around the 
Nation are devastated by extreme weather events made worse by 
the climate crisis: Lives are lost; homes and livelihoods are 
destroyed.
    Power plants are the single largest industrial cause of 
global warming in the United States. They make up 25 percent of 
all carbon pollution nationwide. With fossil fuel power plants 
being such a significant contributor to dangerous air pollution 
that only exacerbates the worsening climate crisis, these 
proposed standards are an important complementary action that 
will benefit all Americans as well as our environment and our 
economy.
    Now, the EPA's proposal will finally set necessary emission 
limits and guidelines for carbon pollution from new and 
existing fossil fuel power plants. It will cut dangerous carbon 
pollution and dramatically improve public health, particularly 
for communities already overburdened by air pollution. And this 
is critical to our ongoing efforts to safeguard clean and safe 
air for all Americans.
    The proposal is estimated to avoid up to 617 million metric 
tons of total carbon dioxide through 2042. That is equivalent 
to the annual emissions of roughly half of the cars in the 
United States. And within the same timeframe, EPA projects that 
the proposed standards will result in up to $85 billion in net 
climate and health-related benefits. We are going to save 
billions of dollars because Americans will be healthier, thanks 
to this proposal's reductions in carbon pollution.
    Now, these are significant benefits, but my Republican 
colleagues would rather ignore them as they continue to push 
their polluters-over-people agenda. They have no problem 
letting dangerous air pollution go unchecked. In fact, they are 
opposed to this proposal. So today we will undoubtedly hear 
arguments from the Republican majority about how EPA's proposal 
is illegal, will shut down power plants and turn off the 
lights. We have heard these claims before, and none of them are 
true. In fact, they get rolled out whenever this or any 
administration acts on air pollution or the climate crisis.
    Now, take the critical investments included in the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act 
to upgrade our Nation's power infrastructure, strengthen the 
grid, and cut power sector pollution with clean energy tax 
credits. Just because none of my Republican colleagues here 
today voted for these laws doesn't mean they don't get--exist. 
They did get enacted. The truth is the market, bolstered by 
these few--by these key Federal investments, is already driving 
changes in the power sector. And EPA's proposal merely builds 
on this existing momentum.
    Republicans are simply not interested in finding solutions 
to our carbon pollution problems. They are not interested in 
developing a plan to help us reduce emissions while still 
maintaining a safe, reasonably priced electricity system.
    The Clean Air Act is clear. EPA has both the authority and 
obligation to protect Americans from dangerous carbon 
pollution, and Republicans have not offered any practical 
solution to address the serious threat of air pollution and the 
climate crisis. Frankly, I think the Republican policy of 
``just say no to any climate action'' is just getting old.
    In my opinion, the EPA's proposal, combined with the 
historic climate investments Democrats made last Congress, will 
put us on track to cleaner air, better health, a safer climate, 
and a stronger economy.

STATEMENTS OF PATRICK O'LOUGHLIN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
     OFFICER, BUCKEYE POWER, INC., AND OHIO RURAL ELECTRIC 
  COOPERATIVES; TODD SNITCHLER, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
    OFFICER, ELECTRIC POWER SUPPLY ASSOCIATION; JAY DUFFY, 
LITIGATION DIRECTOR, CLEAN AIR TASK FORCE; AND MICHAEL J. NASI, 
                  PARTNER, JACKSON WALKER, LLP

                STATEMENT OF PATRICK O'LOUGHLIN

    Mr. O'Loughlin. Thank you, Chairman Johnson.
    Buckeye Power operates as a not-for-profit electric 
cooperative owned by and serving 25 electric distribution 
cooperatives that provide electric service to approximately 1 
million Ohioans. Ohio Electric Cooperative members are largely 
residential and generally living in rural and lower-income 
parts of the State.
    Buckeye owns and operates a diverse set of generating 
resources to meet the power demand requirements of our members 
reliably and economically every hour of every day, during 
normal weather, and during extreme weather events. Today we use 
coal, natural gas, hydropower, biogas, and solar generation, 
coordinated with an extensive demand response program to 
achieve this mission.
    Buckeye Power has invested more than $1 billion in 
environmental control technologies over the last 20 years and 
achieved not only full compliance with all current 
environmental regulations but truly state-of-the-art emission 
reductions.
    Today, however, our electric power system is already 
straining to provide reliable, continuous service. Throughout 
the country, we are experiencing supply emergencies any time 
there is an extreme weather event. The demand for electricity 
is continuing to increase and is expected to increase at an 
even faster pace as more and more end uses are electrified, 
especially the growing demand for electricity to fuel our 
transportation needs.
    New-generation additions in recent years have been limited 
almost exclusively to natural gas, wind, and solar, but they 
have not kept pace with the rapid and disorderly retirement of 
coal-fired generation over this period. Reliability challenges 
have continued to grow as that always-available generation is 
increasingly being replaced by intermittent renewable sources. 
These retirements and many more expected in the coming years 
have largely resulted from a never-ending flood of 
environmental regulations.
    EPA's existing 2020 wastewater discharge rule has caused 
several more plants to plan to retire by 2028. EPA has since 
proposed a new wastewater rule that creates even greater 
hurdles to continued operation.
    The proposed greenhouse gas rule for power plants forces 
unproven emission control concepts on power plant operators in 
unrealistic timeframes. If enacted, it will jeopardize nearly 
every coal-fired power plant by 2039--and, in fact, most by 
2030. Buckeye Power will likely be required to shut down all of 
our coal units by 2030, which currently supply more than 80 
percent of our annual energy requirements, and we have nearly 
no hope of replacing this generation within that short 
timeframe.
    Carbon capture for coal-fired power plants has not been 
proven on more than a portion of the flue gas at a few sites 
and has not been able to operate on a continuous basis at the 
required removal rates that EPA proposes. Large-scale carbon 
capture projects cannot be permitted, designed, procured, and 
installed on more than a few units--being those that are 
already in advanced design stages today--by the 2030 deadline 
EPA requires in order for continued operation.
    The more-than-500-page rule follows 3 other major 
environmental rules either proposed or finalized by EPA aimed 
at fossil-fired power plants just this year, all with somewhat 
questionable support from both an economic and technical 
viewpoint.
    We are a small company. Our entire office staff is about 80 
people charged with running a generation transmission utility 
to meet our members' needs. We are not a regulatory review 
company, yet we are forced to review and comment on these very 
significant regulations in only 60 days. Our company and our 
member consumers can't afford to implement full-scale science 
experiments at our production facilities.
    We all need a reliable electric system for our safety, 
security, and well-being. We can and have implemented large-
scale environmental improvements at our power plants when we 
have commercially available technology that has been 
demonstrated at a reasonable cost. This proposed rule ignores 
these needs that a well-functioning electric system requires.
    Thank you for having me here today, Chairman.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. O'Loughlin follows:]

    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back.
    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Snitchler for your 5 minutes.

                  STATEMENT OF TODD SNITCHLER

    Mr. Snitchler. Good morning, Chairman Johnson and the 
committee.
    Try that again. Good morning, Chairman Johnson, and to the 
committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the 
subcommittee this morning.
    EPSA is the national trade association representing 
America's independent power producers that compete every day in 
regions operating competitive wholesale markets. I would like 
to note that my testimony represents the position of EPSA and 
not necessarily the review--the views of any particular member.
    EPSA members own and operate generating assets which 
account for roughly 20 percent of the Nation's installed 
capacity. Those assets include nearly 115,000 megawatts of 
natural-gas-fired generation. Members also own and operate 
nuclear, wind, solar, battery storage, and coal resources.
    EPSA's members have a deep commitment to the electric grid 
and its reliability, and strongly support the clean energy 
expansion. However, as--even as this energy expansion takes 
place, we cannot lose sight of job number one, which is to 
ensure reliability of the system.
    To ensure reliability, the energy expansion must be done by 
augmenting investment in clean resources with an appropriate 
attention to dispatchable resources and not simply ignoring the 
impacts of efforts to drive dispatchable resources from the 
grid.
    I would like to highlight a few key aspects from my 
testimony.
    First, natural gas generation is critical, and a critical 
component to electric grid reliability, and will only increase 
in importance as variable weather-dependent resources become a 
greater part of our generation mix. In the coming years, 
natural gas generation will be even more important to our 
electric grid reliability in an era of evolving climate 
priorities.
    As the nameplate capacity for wind and solar resources on 
the electric grid increases, the potential volatility of real-
time renewable energy production increases as well. Grid 
operators will need sufficient dispatchable resources like 
natural gas that can serve as a balancing resource as renewable 
energy output rises and falls. The most prominent voices 
highlighting reliability concerns are NERC, FERC, and the grid 
operators themselves: neutral, independent parties with a great 
understanding of the threats facing the electric grid.
    Second, electrification policies are only going to increase 
demands on the power grid at a time when State and Federal 
policies and regulations are driving existing dispatchable 
resources off the system. The electric grid expansion is not 
about a static level of demand being met by dynamic generation 
resources. Electrification policies are going to continue to 
increase demand for additional electricity generation. That 
means we will need more resources, not less, and those 
resources will have to complement each other to deliver on the 
goal of reliability.
    Third, innovative technologies like carbon capture and 
sequestration, long duration electric storage, and hydrogen 
cofiring are promising but are not yet commercially ready for 
widespread adoption. Some who would dismiss concerns about the 
loss of both natural gas and coal generation cite advancements 
in both long duration battery storage and CCS technologies to 
calm fears about reliability. It is important to note that, as 
of June 2023, not a single commercial power plant in the United 
States uses CCS technology, and there are no megawatts of long 
duration, multiday battery storage interconnected to the bulk 
power system. Cofiring hydrogen with natural gas to reduce 
carbon emissions is another developing technology that shows 
promise yet does not have significant commercial adoption 
today.
    Under the proposed rule, these technologies will be the key 
pieces needed to ensure reliability. However, despite not being 
widely used, there is an intense rush to disconnect existing 
resources vital to economic--to electric grid reliability on 
the assumption that these not-yet-available technologies will 
be available when they are needed.
    The voices seeking to dismiss reliability concerns by 
arguing the electric industry has always been able to meet 
policy demands and ensure power is reliable ignore the 
specifics of the current situation and directly contradict the 
reliability concerns voiced by NERC, FERC, and the grid 
operators.
    Our concern is that the EPA's proposed rule once again puts 
aspirational policy goals ahead of operational reality. If 
finalized, these proposed rules will likely lead to power plant 
retirements or reduced availability due to operational limits 
at a time when reliability coordinators and regulators have 
warned that our Nation is already facing a reliability crisis 
due to the accelerated retirement of dispatchable resources.
    EPSA's members maintain a strong commitment to reliability 
and stand ready to help the Nation meet its reliability and 
growing energy needs while enabling the coming energy 
expansion.
    Thank you for the opportunity to be here, and I look 
forward to your questions.

    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back.
    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Duffy for 5 minutes.

                     STATEMENT OF JAY DUFFY

    Mr. Duffy. Thank you, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member 
Tonko, and honorable members of the committee. My name is Jay 
Duffy. I am the litigation director at Clean Air Task Force, a 
nonprofit organization. I have been an attorney with CATF for 
10 years, working on the rules that we will be talking about 
today.
    CATF's mission is to push the technology and policy changes 
needed to achieve a zero-emissions, high-energy planet at an 
affordable cost. In furtherance of that mission, CATF advocates 
for and defends strong pollution control standards for power 
plants.
    A series of listings, findings, and rulemakings made 
pursuant to congressional instructions in the Clean Air Act 
require EPA to set standards and emission guidelines for 
greenhouse gases from fossil-fuel-fired power plants.
    The Clean Air Act is technology forcing and forward 
looking, and its standards of pollution are based on pollution 
controls that the Administrator determines are adequately 
demonstrated and cost reasonable.
    The Supreme Court recently spoke more favorably about 
traditional, at-the-source pollution controls that are cost 
reasonable and cause a power plant to operate more cleanly. But 
a pollution control need not be on every street corner in order 
to be the basis of standards. Standards have been upheld on the 
basis of pilot control technology, test programs, operation of 
one-plant vendor information, and the performance of controls 
in other industries.
    History shows that pollution control options can be 
developed, available, and cost reasonable, yet sit on the 
shelves gathering dust until some regulation or incentive 
pushes or pulls an industry to reduce their pollution. 
Accounting for the changing role and trajectory of the 
regulated power plants and the recent limits imposed by the 
Supreme Court, EPA has undertaken its job, as defined by 
Congress in the Clean Air Act, and it has proposed emission 
standards and guidelines for greenhouse gases from existing and 
new power plants. The proposal can and it should be 
strengthened, but the core elements of the proposal are strong.
    It is key to reality: coal plants are retiring; overall, 
fossil plants are running less, and they are supporting an 
increasingly renewable grid; pollution control costs are coming 
down, both due to learnings through the industry and 
advancements and incentives passed by Congress.
    Generally, EPA's proposal provides a pathway for older 
plants that are approaching retirement and plants that do not 
operate as much to control their pollution based on fuels and 
efficiency. And let's be clear: As proposed, that is the 
majority of the fleet.
    Irrespective of this rule, EPA's model projects that coal-
fired generation capacity will fall from 100 gigawatts in 2028 
to 33 gigawatts in 2035, and that 84 percent of new and 
existing gas units will fall into the proposed low and 
intermediate subcategories with less stringent standards. But 
for those baseload power plants that are operating the most and 
polluting the most, EPA proposes that they meet an emission 
limit commensurate with carbon capture and sequestration or 
hydrogen cofiring.
    EPA first found CCS adequately demonstrated and cost 
reasonable in 2015 for new coal-fired power plants. Post-
combustion capture has only become more cost reasonable, 
widespread, and proven since that time. When EPA set standards 
based on sulfur scrubbers in the 1970s, there were only three 
units in operation, and one vendor for the technology. After 
regulation, the technology was successfully deployed, cost 
declined, and the control became the industry standard.
    At least 13 vendors have done significant testing and offer 
carbon capture and pollution standard--carbon capture pollution 
controls specifically for coal and gas-fired power plants. And 
carbon capture has been--or CCS--has been installed and proven 
on two large-scale coal-fired power plants, and carbon capture 
is currently operating on three coal-fired power plants in the 
United States.
    The Bellingham Natural Gas Combined Cycle Plant 
demonstrated postcombustion capture from 1991 to 2005, 
capturing 85 to 95 percent of its CO<INF>2</INF> emissions. 
There are also several FEED studies that determine the 
technical and economic feasibility of applying postcombustion 
capture to coal- and gas-fired power plants. Due to learning by 
doing and the 45Q tax credits, EPA found the cost of CCS even 
more reasonable now than they did in 2015, and it is well below 
the cost of sulfur scrubbers, a comparable pollution control. 
EPA's record to support standards based on CCS is robust and 
more than sufficient for the purposes of a forward-looking and 
technology-forcing statute.
    The impacts of this proposal are modest and manageable. 
Several overlapping layers of security are in place to ensure 
that we do not need to choose between public health and 
reliable electricity.
    Thank you for inviting me to this important hearing. I look 
forward to the discussion.

    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back.
    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Nasi for 5 minutes.

                  STATEMENT OF MICHAEL J. NASI

    Mr. Nasi. Thank you, Chair Johnson, Ranking Member Tonko, 
and members of the subcommittee. My name is Mike Nasi of the 
Austin office of Jackson Walker, and thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today regarding EPA's new section 111(b) 
and (d) new carbon rule for new and existing power plants.
    As an environmental lawyer who has celebrated the success 
of the Clean Air Act in classes, businesses, and companies 
alike, I regret that the rule reflects a recent trend by EPA to 
act as an energy policymaker as opposed to an environmental 
regulator.
    As a practitioner with 28 years in the power sector and 20 
years in CCS development, I am aware of the promises and the 
challenges we face in CCS. I am also involved in hydrogen 
projects, so I am no stranger to their promise or problems 
either. It is with that background that I come before you today 
to express concerns about EPA's new carbon rule and to point 
out the immediate and lasting impacts it will have on our 
Nation's grid, our economic security, and the rule of law.
    In my written testimony, I spend some time giving a sense 
of the risky state of the electric grid, because it is 
essential that we have that in mind when we enter into a 
discussion about the carbon rule.
    I heavily--I am heavily involved in other EPA dockets, each 
of which will have significant grid impacts, but none as 
significant as the new carbon rule.
    One of the graphics I include in my written testimony 
depicts the compressed timeline that will force premature 
retirements of coal plants on the front end, and ultimately 
drive massive, wide-scale retirements of both coal and gas on 
the back end. For the existing coal fleet, we stand to lose 
about 155,000 megawatts of coal--and that is not the coal that 
is already planning on retiring, that is the coal that is 
planning on sticking around--because they will be faced with 
the immediate doubt and--about the prudence of continuing to 
spend dollars on facilities whose useful lives are now going to 
be cut short because of the deadlines and the infeasible 
control requirements that are starting in just January of 2030, 
which will be, at best, 3 years, you know, to do--to come into 
compliance by the time the State plans are completed.
    Just to give you perspective, 155,000 megawatts is the 
amount of power needed to power between 78 and 140 million 
homes.
    For the existing gas fleet, which is in--also in the same 
range of potential impacts ranging up to about 204,000 
megawatts, they are going to be faced with an impossible 
choice. They are either going to have to down-dispatch to stay 
out of the baseload category, which in many regions will be 
uneconomic and means they will retire, or they will have to 
take the unprecedented risk of hoping that CCS and/or these 
hydrogen technologies will work.
    For the hydrogen pathway, it involves displacing fully 30 
percent of the natural gas they currently use with low GHG 
hydrogen, a water-consumptive fuel that is not yet in existence 
at scale. And in just 6 years after that they have to go to a 
96 percent cofiring of low-GHG hydrogen--again, a nonexistent 
fuel, but then will require a whole new transportation pipeline 
system. If the low hydrogen pathway isn't chosen, they must 
deploy the already mentioned carbon capture at a scale and in a 
timeframe that is unprecedented, even if it is conceivable.
    For those contemplating new gas generation, this rule has 
already chilled investment in efficient, combined-cycle gas 
plants and large-frame combustion turbines because, as of last 
month, they will be held to the same standards with unproven 
technologies in their future. And our inability, our slowing of 
this new gas build is going to prevent us from filling the void 
that is being left by the continued retirement of coal, 
nuclear, and older gas units.
    Turning to the legal defects of the new carbon rule, the 
Clean Power Plan certainly triggers major questions and, 
contrary to those who have suggested otherwise, is running 
afoul of the Supreme Court's decision in
    West Virginia v.
    EPA.
    No matter how much EPA and supporting advocates will try to 
argue that this rule is simply technology forcing, the 
technologies they chose to force don't just force technology at 
the power plant, they force our entire Nation to consent to, 
among other things, the construction of thousands of miles of 
hydrogen and CO<INF>2</INF> pipelines and CO<INF>2</INF> 
storage sites. Even if such an unprecedented national energy 
infrastructure overhaul was conceivable, it is simply not EPA's 
job to mandate it.
    This reliance on outside defense infrastructure is what 
distinguishes CCS from scrubbers, which you have referred to, 
for sulfur dioxide. When we put scrubbers in place, the entire 
system is in our control at the plant. We have the systems to 
manage it all on site. By contrast, CCS necessarily requires 
outside-the-fence infrastructure to transport and inject that 
CO<INF>2</INF>. In all but a handful of cases, that will be 
outside the control of the power plant operator.
    In conclusion, I urge the committee to request the EPA to 
withdraw this proposal and rework the rule. EPA should 
simultaneously reexamine the grid impacts of this rule. And at 
the very least, EPA should extend the current 60-day time 
period to make sure that we do this rule right, because if we 
do it wrong it will be irreversible and ultimately tragic. 
Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Nasi follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back, and I thank our 
witnesses for their testimony, and we will now move into the 
Q&A portion of the hearing. I will begin the questioning, and I 
recognize myself for 5 minutes.
    You know, the timing of this proposal rule--proposed 
rulemaking could not be worse. Our Nation's largest grid 
operator, PJM, which covers my district and the entire State of 
Ohio, warned it could face significant capacity shortfalls by 
the end of the decade. It cited specific EPA rules as the 
primary driver behind this energy shortfall.
    And it is not just Ohio. In fact, the Governor of Virginia 
sent me a copy of a letter he sent to the EPA yesterday in 
advance of this hearing. Virginia, part of the PJM grid, just 
as Ohio is, Governor Youngkin warns that ``this proposal not 
only ignores this looming potential energy crisis, but 
exacerbates the problem.'' I have the letter right here, and I 
am entering it into the record.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr. Johnson. The North American Electric Reliability 
Corporation, NERC, also has noted that significant portions of 
the country face capacity shortfalls during normal and above-
normal demand scenarios. In fact, the CEO of NERC stated just 
last week before a Senate hearing that ``the pace of change is 
overtaking the reliability needs of the system.
    ``Unless reliability and resilience are appropriately 
prioritized, current trends indicate the potential for more 
frequent and more serious long-duration reliability 
disruptions, including the possibility of national consequence 
events.''
    I mean, I have heard my colleagues talk about the EPA's 
mission to manage public health. When is freezing to death and 
suffering from heat exhaustion because you can't heat and cool 
your home because your power is shut down--why is that not a 
public health issue? And I don't understand why the EPA doesn't 
see that.
    I have a question for each of you on the panel, starting 
with my fellow Ohioans.
    Mr. O'Loughlin, for the record here, if this rule goes into 
effect along with the litany of other EPA rules on power 
generation, can my constituents in the PJM grid and families 
across the country expect equal to or better grid reliability 
in 2032 than they do right now?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. Chairman Johnson----
    Mr. Johnson. A quick answer, if you could.
    Mr. O'Loughlin. I don't see any possible way that would be 
true. We are at great risk today, and this will definitely make 
it significantly worse.
    Mr. Johnson. OK. Mr. Snitchler.
    Mr. Snitchler. Mr. Chairman, we would have concerns about 
what the ultimate outcome would be of the litany of policies 
EPA----
    Mr. Johnson. Is that a no under these rules? You don't 
think it is going to be----
    Mr. Snitchler. It has yet to be determined, but it sets us 
up for a real reliability challenge.
    Mr. Johnson. OK. What about Mr. Duffy?
    Mr. Duffy. I think we can maintain reliability. There are 
plenty of flexibilities in this rulemaking, and long 
timelines----
    Mr. Johnson. Yes or no, will it be the same or equal to or 
better?
    Mr. Duffy. I think we can maintain reliability.
    Mr. Johnson. OK. Mr. Nasi.
    Mr. Nasi. There is no way, if you look at the data of the 
RTOs, that our reliability will not be in a much worse shape.
    Mr. Johnson. OK. I am also concerned this rule sends 
negative signals to the energy industry to invest in critical 
natural gas infrastructure. My district sits atop the Utica and 
Marcellus Shale, where we produce clean, abundant American 
natural gas for a number of power generation facilities in our 
region. However, due to many of the market subsidies like tax 
credits for unreliable and nondispatchable wind and solar, 
natural gas generation is becoming increasingly less 
economically competitive.
    On top of that, it is clear that EPA regulations are taking 
this one step further, threatening the economic viability of 
current and future gas-fired generation. For example, the 
proposed rule sets unrealistic requirements like cofiring with 
over 90 percent hydrogen by certain fast-approaching dates, 
despite the fact this technology has never even been adequately 
demonstrated.
    So, Mr. Snitchler, can you explain to us how this rule will 
further harm the economic viability of reliable gas generation 
on our electric grid now and into the future?
    Mr. Snitchler. As owners of natural gas resources or 
developers of new natural gas resources, we are always looking 
for some degree of certainty that would ensure the long-term 
viability and low-cost operation, because unlike regulated 
utilities, competitive power generators have to compete to be 
the lowest-cost, most efficient unit to run.
    And when you find yourself in a situation where you are not 
sure that you will be able to earn a reasonable rate of return 
and you are asked to make billions of dollars of investments, 
that has a chilling effect on investment that suggests that we 
will not see the needed amount of natural gas resources that, 
if you want to increase your wind and solar resources, you need 
to have additional natural gas resources to support them. They 
work together. And if you turn off one, you are left with only 
the other.
    Mr. Johnson. I would submit that PJM's report actually says 
that, of all the retirement and the energy coming off of the 
grid, only 6 percent of it is--of the replacement is natural 
gas. Only 6 percent.
    With that, I yield back and I recognize the ranking member, 
Mr. Tonko, for his questions.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Chairman Johnson.
    Many utilities--excuse me--and power producers have already 
made commitments to close their oldest and their most polluting 
power plants. These announcements long predate this proposal, 
and this is largely because all across the country renewable 
energy is able to compete with existing fossil fuel resources.
    So Mr. Duffy, your testimony mentioned that EPA's modeling 
projects coal-fired power plant capacity will decline from 100 
gigawatts in 2028, and I believe you said 33 gigawatts in 2035, 
irrespective of this rule. Can you expand upon this trend in 
the power sector toward cleaner alternatives?
    And just how does EPA's proposed rule align with trends 
already underway?
    Mr. Duffy. Sure. So what EPA does here is it uses design 
features that they have used for decades with the Clean Air 
Act. So they took the fleet, they divided it into 
subcategories, and then set standards for those subcategories. 
They took into account the fact that these plants are already 
planning on retiring. It doesn't make sense to do a big, huge 
pollution control project on a plant that is intending to 
retire. So there are pathways there.
    And then, as we have mentioned before, the natural gas 
fleet is operating at lower capacity factors to support an 
increasingly renewable grid. And so for those plants there are 
less stringent standards. It is the baseload plants that is--an 
increasingly small percentage that have the more stringent 
standards.
    Mr. Tonko. And again, Mr. Duffy, last year Congress enacted 
the Inflation Reduction Act. How do the incentives included in 
that law complement the rule?
    And will the IRA help reduce compliance costs?
    Mr. Duffy. Yes, for sure. In 2015, when EPA decided that--
determined that CCS was--adequately demonstrated cost 
reasonable, the 45Q credit was at $20. It is now at $85. So 
that significantly changes things.
    And then the baseline, of course, of what the generation 
mix looks like right now has been changed, making, you know, 
carbon pollution standards easier to meet.
    Mr. Tonko. Right. Mr. Duffy, your testimony mentioned an 
analysis that the proposed rule would only cover 7 percent of 
existing natural gas plants, which must be greater than 300 
megawatts and have a capacity factor greater than 50 percent to 
be covered. And I am sure there are many environmental and 
public health organizations that feel too few existing gas 
plants are covered.
    And for the record, I would like to see more sources 
covered too. But for now, let's just examine what EPA has 
actually proposed. Can you please help make this clear to 
everyone?
    Has EPA gone to great lengths to tailor this rule, as 
proposed, toward the largest and the most polluting sources?
    Mr. Duffy. Yes, the most stringent standards are certainly 
on that small percentage that runs baseload.
    Mr. Tonko. And when setting these thresholds, was EPA 
considering the already-underway long-term expected shift in 
our electricity mix, where some of these gas plants--smaller, 
less polluting ones that don't run as frequently--may play a 
role in balancing a grid that is much more reliant on renewable 
resources?
    Mr. Duffy. Certainly. I mean, EPA makes clear that power 
trends were a driving factor in how they designed this rule, 
and also that reliability was of paramount concern in the 
design.
    Mr. Tonko. Right. Well, we made great efforts to make 
certain that we don't claw back some of the incentives of the 
IRA, which are extremely beneficial to this entire picture.
    To summarize, many existing coal plants are already 
planning to retire, and certainly will not be required to take 
meaningful actions under the rule. And many existing gas 
plants, which can play a smaller but certainly perhaps needed a 
role--needed role in grid balancing and reliability, are also 
not covered by the rule.
    This, therefore, I believe, is reasonable and achievable as 
an approach that allows EPA to target the most polluting units 
while following preexisting power sector market trends. We 
should not suggest otherwise.
    And with that, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
    Mr. Palmer [presiding]. I thank the gentleman for his 
questions. The Chair now recognizes the chairman of the full 
committee, the gentlelady from Washington, Mrs. McMorris 
Rodgers, for her questions.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you.
    Delivering electric power reliability and affordability is 
vital for public health and safety. Yet irresponsible climate 
policies have relentlessly been pushing to eliminate the 
baseload generation that is essential for assuring that people 
have power, especially when they need it the most. Grid 
authorities are finally speaking up about the risk to the 
public, as witnesses today are highlighting.
    The Biden administration, like the Obama administration, 
has set policy goals to decarbonize the grid by 2035. And it is 
a pace that is dangerous to the public. The Obama 
administration used the Clean Air Act to circumvent Congress as 
a weapon to force retirements and drive out baseload power, 
even when proposed standards did not withstand legal challenge. 
It looks like the Biden EPA is attempting the same thing.
    Mr. Nasi, would you briefly walk through the estimates in 
your testimony for the immediate and long-term impacts of EPA's 
proposals, how much coal and gas generation could be retired?
    Mr. Nasi. Thank you, Chairwoman, I will. Pages 11 and 12 of 
my testimony set out the data. EPA's models about what is going 
to happen, frankly, are not credible; they don't confer with 
NERC, FERC, RTOs, or States to develop them, and they conflict 
specifically with many of my clients' plans.
    So you have to look at the data, and the data from EIA, 
both Forms 860M and 923, show that about 55,000 megawatts of 
coal is expected to retire by 2032, but 155,000 megawatts are 
not. And so that is what is on the block, the chopping block 
for retirement, for the reasons I explained.
    On the gas fleet, because they have done this by capacity 
factor, you look at that same data set, and you look at the 
capacity factors. And those that are over a 45 percent capacity 
factor--it depends on an economic test, but grossly speaking, 
that would impact 194,000 megawatts of existing gas-fired 
generation. At the best case, if it is actually only over a 55 
percent capacity factor, it is 126,000 gigawatts of existing 
gas. So EPA's predictions are, frankly, at odds with the data 
and the announced plans of folks, and the compressed timelines 
are going to force those retirements.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you. Do you know how many plants would 
actually comply with this rule?
    Mr. Nasi. I mean, we will have a handful of plants--I said 
in my written testimony I am a big supporter of CCS technology. 
I have been involved in projects for 20 years--a handful of 
projects that are sitting on great geology that might be able 
to take the risk. But that is in the hundreds and maybe a 
couple thousand megawatts of that massive fleet. The other 
facilities are just too dependent upon pipeline infrastructure 
that doesn't exist and, on the gas side, hydrogen that doesn't 
exist. Low GHG hydrogen is not a commercial product.
    And so to bank a standard on something that doesn't exist 
in reality now--and even because of metallurgical and other 
reasons, frankly, can't realistically be moved around--is a big 
problem.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you.
    Mr. O'Loughlin and Mr. Snitchler, you are either directly 
responsible for producing and providing power or represent the 
companies that do so. Would retirements on this scale that Mr. 
Nasi just described substantially change the generation mix on 
the grid?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. It will. And what is particularly being 
targeted are baseload generation units, which may be few in 
number, but they provide a large percentage of the energy and a 
large percentage of the reliability services that we depend on.
    You know, as I have said earlier, anybody that has 
seriously looked at our current situation realizes that we have 
elevated risk right now during extreme weather events, and any 
decline in those baseload resources greater than what we are 
already expecting is certainly going to have a negative impact 
on that going forward.
    Mr. Snitchler. I would echo the comments about the need for 
us to ensure that we have sufficient resources. And if you look 
at the EIA data from their most recent report--it just came out 
about a month ago--it talks about the potential need for 
additional resources to support the system, even under a high 
renewables penetration scenario. It is at a minimum of 9 
gigawatts of new natural gas or as high as 360 gigawatts of new 
natural gas which would be required in order to ensure 
reliability on the system. That suggests to me that we are 
going to need more, not less. It is a both-and, not an either-
or, scenario.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you. Back to Mr. Nasi.
    You were involved in the litigation over President Obama's 
Clean Power Plan, which eventually resulted in West Virginia v. 
EPA. Do you think section 111 of the Clean Air Act authorized 
EPA to transform the electric system like this, or is it just 
another example of the Federal agency circumventing Congress' 
Article I authorities?
    Mr. Nasi. Absolutely. You know, the Clean Air Act is based 
in a principle that you can't infer massive powers from 
Congress in vague language. And the Act requires--and the 
Supreme Court's opinion requires--that the system of emission 
reduction start and finish inside the fence of a facility.
    When you are banking on an overhaul of an entire energy 
system, you are technology forcing in a way that is explicitly 
prohibited by both the Act and by the Supreme Court.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you. We are the elected representatives 
of the people. We should be making these decisions around the 
Clean Air Act.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Palmer. The gentlelady yields. The Chair now recognizes 
the gentlewoman from Colorado, Ms. DeGette, for her questions.
    Ms. DeGette. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. So the Clean 
Air Act was specifically designed to give the EPA the authority 
to regulate air pollution, to improve public health and the 
environment, and has held accordingly. And it was also designed 
to be a driver of technologies that can address air pollution 
in a forward-thinking way.
    So, Mr. Duffy, I want to ask you, would you agree that the 
Clean Air Act is technology driving?
    Mr. Duffy. I would, and I think more importantly, so would 
the courts.
    Ms. DeGette. Right.
    Mr. Duffy. They--history shows that you can have pollution 
controls that are not--you know, being deployed, but they are 
not being deployed because there is not a regulation to require 
them. Why would you install a pollution control if there is no 
regulation to do so?
    Ms. DeGette. Exactly. And this rule that we are talking 
about today, as proposed, fits in with the description of 
technology driving under the Clean Air Act. Is that right?
    Mr. Duffy. That is right. I mean, for, you know, the fuels 
and efficiencies, which is the bulk of--the basis of the 
standards, those have been done for decades. CCS, there is 
adequate demonstration that it can be scaled up for this source 
category.
    Ms. DeGette. And also, this draft rule is aligned with 
EPA's previous work under the Clean Air Act. And I am wondering 
if you can expand your last answer to explain exactly how the 
draft rule is similar to previous EPA rules.
    Mr. Duffy. Sure. So, you know, I have used the example of 
sulfur scrubbers. You know, in the 1970s we were hearing these 
same sorts of arguments because there was only one vendor out 
there for sulfur scrubbers. There were only three in operation. 
And they set standards, and cost declined, the pollution 
control was deployed, there were 16 vendors by the end of the 
decade, and it became the industry standard.
    Ms. DeGette. Right, that is right. So this rule, it seems 
to me, seems like sort of the next step in combating air 
pollution from coal- and gas-fired plants.
    And so I want to move on and say EPA projects that coal-
fired electricity generation will fall to 33 gigawatts in 2035, 
regardless of whether this rule was implemented or not.
    So how does this rule complement the trends that are 
already taking place in the markets?
    Mr. Duffy. Right. I mean, it was actually pursuant to, you 
know, large trade associations' request that EPA set these 
glide paths, these pathways for plants that are nearing the end 
of their useful lives, such that they didn't have to install 
major pollution control technologies and make that investment 
when they wouldn't be able to recoup it. So that seems to me a 
meaningful--a reasonable path forward when these plants are, 
you know, at the end of their useful lives.
    Those that continue to run, CCS is cost effective and 
available and, most importantly, reduces nearly all the 
pollution, the climate pollution, from the power plant. And so 
that is the basis of the standards for that sector.
    Ms. DeGette. Yes, and frankly, we are seeing this in my 
home State of Colorado already, where the coal-fired plants, 
for business reasons, are coming offline and people are moving 
to other alternatives.
    And so Mr. Tonko asked you the question, and I think it is 
worth expanding on it. The Inflation Reduction Act actually 
lowered the cost for the new technologies, is that right?
    Mr. Duffy. That is right. As I said, it is kind of a two-
part answer. It, number one, reduced the cost of CCS to be even 
more reasonable and, in some places, you know, cost effective, 
not just, you know, a cost of doing business. And so there is 
that.
    And then there is also the fact that the grid is being 
supported in a way where, you know, replacement generation is 
more and more affordable.
    Ms. DeGette. Yes. So in your opinion, does this rule seem 
overly burdensome, or does it seem like a commonsense next step 
that EPA should take?
    Mr. Duffy. This seems like a pretty traditional, inside-
the-fence rule that EPA has been doing for decades under 
section 111.
    Ms. DeGette. Great. Thank you very much.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Palmer. I thank the gentlelady. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Carter, for his 
questions.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank each of you 
for being here. This is extremely important, and this is 
something I am very concerned with, and that is EPA and other 
agencies promulgating rules and essentially doing the work of 
what is supposed to be Congress and the elected officials, and 
then what we are going to find here is that this is going to 
send negative signals to the entire power industry to invest in 
baseload generation. And that is not what we need.
    You know, I am still stinging from the State of the Union 
address, when the President of the United States, in the same 
breath, blamed the high price of gasoline on the fact that the 
fossil fuel industry was not investing in the infrastructure, 
and then in the next breath said, oh, we are not going to need 
fossil fuels in the next 10 years, anyway. Duh.
    I mean, this is serious stuff here, and I am very concerned 
about this. We are putting every rule imaginable into the way 
of the most reliable power-generating sources we have. Sixty 
percent of this Nation's energy comes from natural gas and 
coal, and we are--and here is the EPA putting these rules and 
regulations in the way of this. And it is just--when you talk 
about carbon capture technology, it is just not economical yet. 
Do we want to get there? Yes, we want to get there. But it is--
we are not there yet, and that is a problem.
    I had the opportunity to travel with the Conservative 
Conference--the Conservative Climate Caucus, to Europe. And 
what we recognized there and what we saw was that they have 
allowed their policies to get ahead of their innovation in 
Europe, and now they have got a mess. Now they are going back 
to coal after they shut down their nuclear plants and 
everything else. We should learn an important lesson there that 
we not let our policies get ahead of our innovation.
    Mr. O'Loughlin, I want to ask you. In light of this rule, 
in light of the rule that we are discussing here today and many 
others from EPA, where do you see investments in the power 
sector going?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. Yes, well, it is a difficult answer for 
baseload generation. Obviously, the Government is incenting 
more wind and solar, and I think we will see more of that, and 
we--which is fine.
    But the investment--you know, I would like to expand a 
little bit on why I am so confident that we are going to see a 
lot of closures of coal plants and probably some basic natural 
gas, and it is the state of carbon capture systems, which are--
have been demonstrated to be able to capture carbon at some 
larger scale, but they have never been demonstrated according 
to the requirements in this EPA proposed rule. They have never 
captured a full output of a unit of the size and scope of the 
units that we operate. It has never been required to operate on 
a continuous basis at a 90 percent capture rate, and they just 
simply have not been demonstrated to even be able to do that, 
let alone to do it at a reasonable cost.
    So I am quite confident that many operators of coal plants 
are not going to be able to just throw money away on this--what 
I will call a science experiment--that this might work on a 
full-scale----
    Mr. Carter. Understood.
    Mr. O'Loughlin [continuing]. Large, baseload-generating 
unit.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you.
    Mr. Snitchler, let me ask you. How is it simply proposing 
this rule, simply proposing it and subjecting the industry to 
further regulatory uncertainty, affect planning and investment? 
How does a company do that?
    Mr. Snitchler. The degree of uncertainty that is raised 
chills investment, quite simply.
    If you look at the----
    Mr. Carter. Sort of like if the President says we are not 
going to need fossil fuel in the next 10 years?
    Mr. Snitchler. Well, if you are looking at making a 20- or 
30-year investment in infrastructure to a power plant, you are 
not going to make a 20-year or 30-year investment on a 10-year 
time horizon. So you elect not to make that investment.
    The challenge becomes, as we look at this energy expansion, 
as I noted before, with electrification, increased load, you 
are going to need more resources, not less. And as the resource 
mix changes, it is not a one-for-one replacement. If you add 
10,000 megawatts of wind or solar, you still need to have 1,000 
megawatts or more of natural-gas-fired resources in order to 
back them up when they don't operate. And so they work 
symbiotically, and they are required to work together.
    Mr. Carter. Let's talk about pipelines for a second, and 
that is important to me because we just got a letter, the 
Georgia delegation just got a letter from the Georgia Public 
Service Commission to the entire delegation telling us how a 
lack of pipelines is threatening our ability to be competitive. 
Do you think that is true?
    Mr. Snitchler. I think the need for infrastructure is 
clear. If we are going to need to see an expansion of the 
natural gas system, even if it operates less frequently and at 
a lower capacity factor, it is going to need to be able to have 
access to the resources. And right now there is not sufficient 
access to those resources. And that creates a problem, because 
if you can't--if it is not there, it doesn't matter if you 
build a plant or not.
    Mr. Carter. Is it a financial problem or a liability 
problem, or both?
    Mr. Snitchler. It is an all-of-the-above problem.
    Mr. Carter. OK. All right, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it.
    Thank you both. Thank all of you for being here. This is 
extremely important.
    And thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will yield back.
    Mr. Johnson [presiding]. The gentleman yields back. The 
Chair now recognizes the gentlelady Ms. Schakowsky for 5 
minutes.
    Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Under the proposed 
rule, EPA estimates that the new standard would actually have 
net climate, health, and--climate and health benefits to the 
tune of about $85 billion.
    Specifically, the new standards would prevent more than 
1,000 premature deaths, 300,000 asthma attacks, 38,000 school 
absences, 66,000 losses in jobs that we would be able to save.
    So, Mr. Duffy, I wanted to ask you, can you go into more 
detail about the--about how the rule would actually result in 
some cost savings, especially when it comes to healthcare?
    Mr. Duffy. Sure. You know, so as Ben Franklin said, an 
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and that 
certainly is the case with the Clean Air Act. These health 
benefits, EPA estimates, will outweigh the compliance costs 7 
to 1. So I think that is important here. And as you mentioned, 
between 2024 and 2042, the range of health benefits associated 
with this rule is 64 billion to 85 billion.
    So I think, you know, we need to be conscious of what--the 
purpose of this Act here, which is to protect public health.
    Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you. And also, Mr. Duffy, I wanted to 
ask you, did the clean energy provisions that are included in 
the bills that we have passed--we have talked about the 
Inflation Reduction Act, et cetera--and the EPA rule increase 
costs to American consumers?
    I think that is sort of a bottom line that people are 
asking. And what is your view? I think we ought to, you know, 
set the record straight.
    Mr. Duffy. Yes, let's do that. So per the Princeton 
University's REPEAT Project, enacting the Inflation Reduction 
Act would lower annual U.S. energy expenditures by at least 4 
percent in 2030. That is a savings of nearly $50 billion per 
household per year for businesses, households, industry. That 
translates into hundreds of dollars in annual energy savings 
costs for U.S. households.
    Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you. So in your testimony you state 
that fossil fuel power plants are operating at lower capacity, 
and that what we are seeing now is that renewable generation is 
actually accounting for greater energy production.
    Mr. Duffy. Yes, that is right. I mean, that's the trends 
and, you know, the power sector trends that EPA is keying these 
rulemakings to. They want to make sure that they are supporting 
an ongoing transition that is happening already.
    So, as you mentioned, you know, fossil plants are running 
less to support an increasingly renewable grid, baseload power 
plants are retiring, pollution control costs are coming down. 
These are things that are happening in reality. And it is EPA's 
job to look at what is happening in the world and determine the 
best systems of emission reduction for carbon pollution.
    Ms. Schakowsky. So we are hearing a lot about--a lot of 
pessimism, I think, about the possibility of the kind of 
innovation that we need to have in order to achieve both our 
goals of power generation and also healthcare. Can you comment 
on that?
    Mr. Duffy. Absolutely. I am similarly struck. I think, you 
know, the Clean Air Act has driven, you know, American 
innovation for decades.
    Once a regulation is set, industry generally overcomplies, 
has costs come down lower than even anticipated, and then we 
don't have the air pollution and the public health detriments 
that are associated with their pollution.
    Ms. Schakowsky. So you think that we can achieve the goal 
to--we don't have to make a choice between clean air and 
energy?
    Mr. Duffy. No, I don't think so. And that is how the Clean 
Air Act is designed: It provides those factors, it gives EPA 
the job of looking at what are the pollution controls that are 
out there, which ones are adequately demonstrated, which ones 
are cost reasonable, consider energy. So all of those things 
are the job of EPA, and they have set about doing that here, 
and I think it is--they did it fairly successfully.
    Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you.
    And I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes Mr. Palmer for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Palmer. Just a couple of points here. I would like to 
quote the former chairman of this committee, John Dingell, who 
said that he was present when we--meaning Congress--wrote the 
Clean Air Act, and he thought it was clear enough that not even 
the Supreme Court was stupid enough to determine that the EPA 
had the authority to regulate greenhouse gases. I think I agree 
with Congressman Dingell, Chairman Dingell.
    I just want to point out a couple of things. One, I keep 
hearing people talk about this existential threat that climate 
change is to the country. And I don't know where they get that 
information, because even the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change findings indicate that there has been no 
connection to human activity to increase the frequency or the 
intensity of hurricanes, or droughts, or any of that. So I just 
want to--I just wish people would stick to the science.
    But there has been a lot of discussion about the health 
impacts. And there was an article a couple of weeks ago in The 
Economist where they had done a study, and they determined that 
68,000 people died as a result of higher energy costs in 
Europe. Sixty-eight thousand. Is that a problem, Mr. Duffy?
    Mr. Duffy. Absolutely.
    Mr. Palmer. Well, why would you inflict that on American 
people?
    Mr. Duffy. I think that is a false choice.
    Mr. Palmer. No, it isn't a false choice, because it is the 
conversion of European hydrocarbon energy to renewables that 
precipitated this. It is the problem in the UK, an enormous 
problem in the UK. Residential household energy use in the UK 
has gone down 10 percent, not because they have become more 
efficient but because they can't afford it. That 68,000 is more 
than the estimated number of people who died from COVID at 
59,700.
    And I think it is a huge problem, Mr. Nasi, that we 
continue to make these moves that have--could have and are 
having enormously devastating consequences for people, 
particularly people who are living in energy poverty already.
    Mr. Nasi. Yes, sir. I mean, I think on page 18 of my 
testimony I conclude with a statement of you really don't even 
have to debate climate change to know that the Clean Air Act 
directs this agency, this EPA, to do a materiality analysis.
    I mean, we can zero out our entire fossil fleet and we make 
a 0.7 percent difference in global CO<INF>2</INF> 
concentrations. That is not a debate about climate science. 
That is assuming all linkages that IPCC would assume. That is 
just math. And so, when you balance that against the actual 
exposure of--to life and treasure that are associated with 
outages, it is a big problem.
    In Texas I was without power a week. We killed between 250 
and 700 people. It is an embarrassment. It is a cautionary tale 
for the entire world to follow. We accelerated too fast, too 
far. And this rule would do more of the same.
    Mr. Palmer. Well, not only would it do that, not only would 
it endanger the lives of American people, it makes--it becomes 
a national security issue as well, because we cannot have a 
power grid that is 100 percent renewable without being almost 
100 percent reliant on China to provide the resources that we 
need, many of--much of which was built with slave labor, but 
that is a whole different point. I guess that is just 
considered collateral damage by some folks who are supporting 
renewables.
    But wouldn't that not only be a problem for our economy but 
also for our national security?
    Mr. Nasi. Yes, I mean, it is a big geopolitical issue. I 
mean, I think the sad truth is, for those that would actually 
want to see CCS deployed--which I actually have historically 
been a supporter of--the picture is global. And the fact that 
the United States is defunding fossil projects even if they are 
CCS-equipped is a problem.
    We need to turn--everybody can agree that we need to help 
bring people out of energy poverty. That will have material 
health benefits to human flourishing. And nothing we do 
domestically is going to change that reality, and so it is just 
a misallocation of capital. We should be focusing on the bigger 
picture.
    Mr. Palmer. What is interesting is that, as India and China 
have gone to fossil fuel coal predominantly to build out their 
energy infrastructure, the life expectancies in those countries 
have gone up dramatically----
    Mr. Nasi. Right.
    Mr. Palmer [continuing]. Over the last 25 years, yet there 
are still 2.4 billion people who don't have access to reliable 
energy. They are cooking their food indoors using wood and 
biomass, cow dung, other stuff. I think the WHO estimates about 
500,000 have died as a result of that. What would the impact be 
if we could provide them with, say, natural gas as a means of 
providing energy, and particularly as a means of cooking their 
food?
    Mr. Nasi. I mean, I spoke to the United Nations a few 
months ago, and I simply stated climate deprivation is not a 
moral climate--I am sorry, energy deprivation is not a moral 
climate policy. We should be empowering them to build gas and 
bring themselves out of energy poverty.
    Mr. Palmer. Mr. Chairman, I think what he just said should 
be taken note of, that the policies that are being pushed are 
immoral, and the dangers that they inflict on people.
    One quick question. Mr. Duffy, you mentioned that flue gas 
scrubbers--the first one was built in the 1970s. What company 
was that? You mentioned the only vendor in 1970. Do you know 
what company that was?
    Mr. Duffy. I apologize, I don't know what the company's 
name was off the top of my head.
    Mr. Palmer. Well, I worked for the company that built them.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Duffy. The gentleman's time has 
expired. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Sarbanes for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to 
the panel.
    I can't think of a greater moral imperative than to 
successfully make this transition to renewable sources of 
energy as quickly as we can, but also practically, if we are 
going to address climate change and address the health effects 
that we see from reliance on fossil fuels for sourcing 
electricity and other power.
    The EPA's proposed power plant rule, which, obviously, we 
are talking about today, is part of a very sensible, ongoing 
effort by the Biden-Harris administration to ensure that 
reliable energy does not come at the expense of public health. 
That is the idea here. And the rule would set very reasonable 
pollution limits on power plants protecting the health and 
well-being of Americans across the country. In particular, I 
will just mention the low-income often--and communities of 
color that have often borne the brunt of such pollution, again, 
if we want to tie it back to a moral imperative underlying 
this.
    The rule is not an overreach. It is a sound, commonsense, 
practical step to take. It is exactly what the EPA should be 
doing.
    I want to touch on reliability, which is a topic, 
obviously, that we have been talking about quite a bit here 
today. I represent central Maryland, which is firmly within the 
PJM grid. Earlier this year, PJM forecasted that its grid would 
see roughly 40 gigawatts of retirements--retirements, I will 
note, that it explicitly did not tie to the rule that we are 
discussing today. It has also had, as of the time of that 
report, 290 gigawatts of capacity trying to connect to PJM's 
grid.
    Mr. Duffy, we have heard some fearmongering clearly about 
resource retirements today, but could you talk a little bit 
about how the grid operators actually have quite a big lever to 
get more power onto their grid quickly by reforming their 
interconnection policies?
    Mr. Duffy. So fortunately or unfortunately, I am not a FERC 
attorney, but I can--you know, I--as I am not prepared to speak 
on kind of reforming the interconnection policies. But what I 
can share is that the proposal is going to allow grid 
operators, plant owners, and States significant lead time in 
order to, you know, deal with these sorts of issues so that 
they can--the flexibilities can accommodate the dynamics in 
their grid.
    EPA has also committed to near-constant communication with 
DOE and FERC throughout this process. I am also happy to talk 
about kind of the reliability features that are in this rule--
--
    Mr. Sarbanes. Right.
    Mr. Duffy [continuing]. To help support the rule.
    Mr. Sarbanes. I appreciate that.
    Mr. Chairman, without objection, I would like to enter into 
the record a report prepared by Wilson Energy Economics 
critiquing the PJM report.
    Mr. Johnson. Without objection, so ordered.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Mr. Sarbanes. Thanks very much.
    My Republican colleagues are concerned, clearly, about 
energy reliability in these discussions about EPA potentially 
regulating pollution from power plants. But I think they may be 
actively--or maybe it is unwittingly--ignoring the significant 
reliability shortcomings of fossil fuels.
    So Mr. Duffy, maybe take a shot at that. Can you describe 
the reliability concerns associated with fossil fuels--because 
we keep hearing about it on the other side of the ledger--and 
why we should remember that fossil fuels are not 100 percent 
reliable?
    Mr. Duffy. Sure. I mean, especially with aging coal plants, 
they--you know, as they reach their remaining useful life, 
there is more time that they have to--they break down and need 
to be fixed. You know, we have had coal piles being frozen 
before. So it is not a--there is not a silver bullet here. And 
the best way to keep fossil on the grid at baseload is with 
this virtually free carbon pollution technology.
    Mr. Sarbanes. I appreciate that. I mean, the goal here, 
obviously, is to strike a balance as we move as quickly and 
intentionally as we can towards a new portfolio when it comes 
to how we power our society and, frankly, how we lead globally 
here. And we have got more to do in that respect.
    So I want to thank you for explaining how we don't have to 
choose between reasonable pollution regulation, which will lead 
to healthier communities on the one hand, and reliable 
electricity, which, from what I can discern, EPA's rule will 
actually enhance over time.
    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Crenshaw, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    We are here today to discuss yet another horribly 
unrealistic rule proposed by the EPA. This rule would require 
that we reduce CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from power plants to 
such an extent that most coal and many natural gas plants will 
likely be forced offline by the end of the decade. So we are in 
a country where our energy demand will increase by at least 30 
percent over the next couple of decades. This EPA wants to 
reduce our energy generation, which is just genius.
    And I heard earlier that power plants are the biggest 
emitter of carbon dioxide in America, and so we have to, you 
know, save Americans from them. Yet they are also the biggest 
emitter of electricity. Yes, electricity. And I don't know how 
that doesn't matter to this administration or the entire 
Democrat Party. Why does no one seem to have an answer for how 
we might replace that power generation, replace that 
electricity? Why won't anyone from this administration or the 
other side of the aisle acknowledge how physically impossible 
it is to replace baseload energy with renewables?
    I would love answers--answers, for instance, how we are 
going to come up with a land mass the size of South Dakota to 
put the amount of solar and wind farms necessary to replace 
such generation, or the thousands of miles of additional power 
lines, or the additional steel required, the copper, the 
cobalt, all of the critical minerals. Where is that going to 
come from? There is just some whimsical assumptions that it 
will all work out because Greta Thunberg says it will.
    Now, if the goal is to protect Americans, maybe protecting 
their ability to heat their homes or cool their homes in the 
summer might be important. You know, not a single American is 
actually harmed by CO<INF>2</INF> as a pollutant, and yet that 
has been the claim by my colleagues in this hearing as we all 
breathe out copious amounts of CO<INF>2</INF>. It is not the 
pollutant giving anyone asthma. Can we at least stick to the 
science if we are going to have this discussion?
    And if the claim is that additional CO<INF>2</INF> warms 
the planet over time, then we might consider the fact that 
all--if the U.S. completely abolished all CO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions, then it would have a negligible effect on 
temperature and climate. And that is not according to me, that 
is according to all relevant climate modeling. A carbon-free 
America by 2050 would reduce CO<INF>2</INF> concentration by a 
mere 2.2 percent, and a negligible effect on the climate.
    So once again, we find ourselves in a really simple policy 
discussion about costs versus benefits. This EPA seems content 
to impose massive costs on Americans without any clear benefits 
to speak of. I don't think the mission, the original one, of 
the EPA was supposed to be to reverse human flourishing, but it 
certainly seems that that is the goal now. They want to remove 
power generation from an already stressed electrical grid.
    And for what benefit? None. Just some hand-waving and 
sloganeering about, you know, saving the Earth and protecting 
people and our children. But catchy slogans and angry teenagers 
from Sweden are not a good excuse to upend the American way of 
life and threaten the reliability of the power grid.
    Mr. Nasi, you mentioned that over 55,000 megawatts of 
existing coal is already scheduled for retirement by 2032. And 
because of this proposed rule, we have got another potential 
155,000 megawatts at risk of retirement. I just have a 
question. Is there any real chance that this loss of generation 
gets replaced by reliable energy, or even intermittent 
renewable energy?
    Mr. Nasi. Well, I mean, even if theoretically we could fill 
that gap with natural gas generation, as you have heard 
multiple witnesses testify, this rule just put a chilling 
effect.
    I mean, I have clients that are trying to build new gas. 
This rule freezes everybody in place, not just because of the 
general uncertainty, but as of May 23rd, you know, last month, 
any plant built after that date is subject to things that don't 
exist today. And who is going to invest and finance that 
project, right? And so it is a problem that we are not going to 
solve.
    And to the point of EPA modeling what coal plants are--it 
is not EPA's job to say whether a coal plant is going to 
retire. It is actually, under the Clean Air Act, the State's 
job. And EPA is running right through that stop sign and 
modeling a rule predicting something that is contrary to the 
data. And actually, the Clean Air Act contemplated that and 
told them, no, you are going to actually have to ask the 
State's opinion, and they have not.
    Mr. Crenshaw. Mr. O'Loughlin, could you build upon that 
notion of potential investment in reliable baseload energy 
because of this rule?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. Yes. The rule--I mean, there has been this 
choice between reasonable environmental regulation and reliable 
electricity. I agree we don't have to make that choice. But I 
would say this is not a reasonable environmental regulation. It 
is going to force unproven technologies onto plants, and 
operators like ourselves that have to answer to consumers are 
not going to invest in things that they can't reliably depend 
on to meet their needs and create further stranded costs above 
what has already been created by the--by this rule.
    So it is going to cause us to not invest in our current 
facilities, and it has sort of shut off natural gas as an 
option, because it has got the same problem: unproven 
technologies to try to replace our coal fleet.
    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, and I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentlelady from New York, Ms. Clarke, for 5 
minutes.
    Ms. Clarke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank our 
Ranking Member Tonko. I thank our panelists for being here to 
testify for us today.
    And while I am glad that this subcommittee is considering 
the importance of power plant emissions to ensure our 
constituents have clean air to breathe, I reject the premise of 
the hearing that we cannot set our Nation on a path to 
decarbonize the power sector without having reliable and low-
cost energy--electricity.
    The State of New York is a clear counterexample to the 
false Republican narrative. Our State passed the Climate 
Leadership and Community Protection Act of 2019 and is now well 
on its way to achieving 70 percent renewable energy by 2030 
without significant reliability concerns. If Republicans were 
serious about their concerns with reliability, they would 
commit to working with Democrats to modernize our Nation's 
transmission infrastructure, which would immediately improve 
reliability and resiliency against extreme weather events and 
lower energy costs.
    My first question is to Mr. Duffy.
    In your testimony, you called the EPA's current proposal a 
reasonable approach in line with the power sector's trends but 
note that it should be strengthened. I agree with the 
assessment. I was disappointed to see the proposal lack action 
toward peaker power plants, which in New York represent more 
than 50 fossil fuel power plants. Many of these have been 
operating since the 1970s or earlier and have little or no 
pollution control equipment to reduce emissions and are located 
almost exclusively in environmentally overburdened communities 
of color.
    In what ways can this rule be strengthened, especially with 
regard to the Nation's dirtiest power plants and in ways to 
protect the most vulnerable communities from overlapping 
sources of pollution?
    Mr. Duffy. Sure. Thank you for that question. So there are 
two things that--you know, it is early days in reviewing this 
big proposal, but there are two things that come to mind as far 
as strengthening it.
    One is, as you mentioned, the coverage of the existing gas 
plants. So EPA has proposed to cover those that are bigger than 
300 megawatts and that are operating more than 50 percent of 
the time. That covers just 7 percent of the existing natural 
gas fleet, less than 30 percent of their CO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions. EPA has asked for comment on down to 150 megawatts 
and 40 percent capacity factors. That would move us up to 44 
percent of all units covering almost 80 percent of emissions. 
So there is a really big swing that can happen there, and we 
have been looking at that.
    The second is on timelines. It makes a lot of sense to have 
longer timelines for big pollution control technology, 
construction like CCS, but for things like fuels and 
efficiencies we are looking at whether that can be done on a 
shorter timeframe.
    Ms. Clarke. Thank you. It is important that when policy 
prioritizes polluters over public health, it is our most 
vulnerable community members--seniors, pregnant women, 
children--who are hurt the most. Further handcuffing our 
economy to fossil fuels does nothing but trap our frontline 
communities in unhealthy environments, as communities of color 
are often the ones bearing a disproportionate share of the 
impacts from pollution and climate change.
    I mentioned earlier that New York has led the country in 
setting emissions reductions goals and making actionable plans 
to meet those goals. For example, New York's Peaker Rule is 
expected to retire over 1,600 megawatts of fossil fuel peaker 
power plants by 2025, setting the State on a path towards 70 
percent renewable energy by 2030 and saving countless lives 
caused by environmental pollution.
    However, I know not every one of my colleagues is blessed 
to represent a State that has taken significant steps toward 
climate pollution reductions. Mr. Duffy, EPA's proposed rule 
included necessary flexibility to account for the different 
resources and meet States where they are. What flexibilities 
are available to States to comply with these standards, and 
does that flexibility account for the need for grid reliability 
and resiliency?
    Mr. Duffy. Yes. So the way the Clean Air Act works, EPA 
sets emission guidelines for existing sources. The States then 
write their own plans. Generally, they have to have those--the 
standards be equivalent to what EPA has proposed. They can go 
stronger. They can also consider the remaining useful life and 
other factors of these plants and have less stringent 
standards.
    EPA is also taking a lot of comments on how--whether or not 
trading and averaging and different types of compliance 
programs could be equivalent with EPA's emission guidelines. So 
there is a lot of flexibility for the States to engage with 
local communities, with the power plant owners, and design a 
plan that works for them.
    Ms. Clarke. Very well. Thank you.
    I remain committed to ensuring my constituents have clean 
air to breathe and that we act with the urgency the climate 
crisis demands.
    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania, our Vice Chair of 
the Environment, Manufacturing, and Critical Materials 
Subcommittee, Dr. John Joyce.
    Mr. Joyce. First of all, I want to thank you, Chairman 
Johnson, for holding today's important hearing.
    Over the past few years, we have heard the Biden 
administration proudly discuss the so-called wonders of 
renewable energy. And unfortunately, the rush to adopt green 
technology will have dramatic consequences on the reliability 
of the electric grid. This year, the regional transmission 
organization PJM released a report on the state of the grid and 
its load capacity. There were significant decreases in energy 
resources for the third year in a row, especially in coal. This 
continued decline of energy has led PJM to project that its 
reserve margin will decrease from 23 percent currently to a 
maximum of 15 percent, or perhaps even as low as 5 percent by 
2030.
    Through my conversations with Pennsylvania utility 
companies, I know how close we came last Christmas Eve to 
rolling blackouts as the temperatures dropped to below zero 
degrees Fahrenheit. I am deeply concerned that escalating EPA 
regulations will further push baseload power generation off the 
grid and close the critical power plants that are desperately 
needed for the energy that my constituents rely on summer, 
winter, fall, and spring.
    One example in my home State is the closure of Homer City 
generation facility as the largest coal power plant in the 
State. Losing its generating capacity will move my constituents 
one step closer to the rolling brownouts that Texas and 
California have experienced. It could not be clearer that the 
regulatory uncertainty created by the EPA is a large factor 
driving investment away from plants like these.
    Our Nation has led the world in emissions reduction, and we 
can continue to do that through American innovation and 
American ingenuity. But we cannot afford to let--government 
policies written with a misunderstanding of real world will put 
Americans at risk.
    My first question is for you, Mr. O'Loughlin. I am 
concerned about how deployable some of the new power generation 
technology is in the short term. Has a power plant with carbon 
capture and storage or a power plant that is hydrogen cofired 
to date been adequately demonstrated for 24/7 power generation 
and connected to the grid? Does that exist right now?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. It does not. We don't have any examples of 
those in the United States today. And as I said, the CCS 
projects that have been demonstrated to date have been at a 
much lesser reliability and at a lower quantity of flue gas 
that they have been able to treat.
    And I think there has been some disagreement about how 
reasonable this is and what the effect on reliability is. EPA 
has worked on this rule for 18 months. We now have 60 days to 
digest it and respond to it. And I guess I would suggest that 
EPA provide an adequate time for an independent review of the 
reliability impacts of this rule, because I think there is a 
lot to it and I think that it is likely to have a very 
significant negative impact on reliability at coal plants and 
at natural gas plants.
    Mr. Joyce. I share your concerns about that negative 
potential impact.
    Mr. Nasi, utilities have to make decisions in the next few 
years about the future of their generation fleets, and there is 
simply not enough time to prove and deploy the technology that 
EPA expects. For example, if a coal plant does not plan to 
retire, it must be running with carbon capture and storage at 
90 percent by 2030. Similar decisions will be required for 
existing natural gas generations, as they are mandated to add 
carbon capture or hydrogen in similar timeframes.
    Including the time needed for State regulations to be 
implemented, how much time will utilities have to decide the 
fate of their existing fleets? Is it 10 years? Is it 5 years? 
Is it 2 years? What can we expect?
    Mr. Nasi. Well, thank you, Doctor. And on page 11 of my 
testimony I put together a graphic, because that is really the 
heart and soul of the reliability problem, is that by the time 
the States get their 2 years--and they will use every bit of 
that, because they will need it--we will basically have 3 years 
to build this stuff.
    And every day at power plants--and I am at their boards all 
the time--they are making capital decisions about can I afford 
to keep on putting money into a plant, and they always evaluate 
how much life do I have. And if I have got a 30-year remaining 
useful life that just got cut down to 10, I am not going to 
make a capital investment. That is what accelerates the 
retirements, is when you force people to amortize it over a 
shorter period of time.
    Mr. Joyce. Mr. Snitchler, without a clear path for 
replacement of natural gas generation, what are the options for 
operators? Will baseload nuclear be available to replace the 
140 gigawatts of coal or the 40 to 60 percent of the coal fleet 
within 3 years?
    Mr. Snitchler. Well, given the experience of the nuclear 
fleet now, there is only one nuclear unit currently under 
construction in the United States, and that is in Georgia. So I 
don't think we are going to see a rapid expansion of nuclear 
resources that are capable of filling that gap. And unless 
there is a technology breakthrough that we are hoping for--but 
you can't plan your grid around hope--then we are not going to 
find ourselves in a spot where we have sufficient resources 
should those retirements occur.
    And so the technologies that are evolving and may work--
small modular reactors and carbon capture and hydrogen 
cofiring--all are great on the drawing board, but they are not 
commercially available today. And if we want to meet those 
aggressive timelines, you have to have technology that can be 
deployable now.
    Mr. Joyce. I think that you concluded with a great take-
home message: We cannot build that just on hope.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Ruiz, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Ruiz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    My home State of California has made serious efforts to 
move away from an addiction or dependance on fossil fuels as we 
look towards the future. The Inflation Reduction Act and the 
CHIPS and Science Act have made much-needed investments in 
domestic battery manufacturing and lithium recovery. This 
funding is essential to advancing renewable energy here at 
home.
    A smooth transition--smooth transition--is needed to remove 
our grids from the dirty climate-changing energy of the past 
and catapult us into the future of a new, reliable and clean 
energy grid. This includes powering our homes and businesses 
with solar, wind, and battery storage and all of the above.
    However, we cannot move forward at the expense of 
vulnerable or frontline communities. We cannot invest in 
production without enforcement of the Clean Air Act standard 
for healthy air quality. I believe we can advance our grid 
while keeping our air quality safe to breathe.
    The American Lung Association has given all three of the 
counties in my district a failing grade for air particle 
pollution, which has serious impacts on the health of my 
constituents. And as you know, I am an emergency medicine 
physician and public health expert, and that is very important 
to me. That is why I am particularly passionate about 
supporting the EPA's congressionally granted authority to 
protect the public's health and the environment, including 
through pollution standards like the one we are discussing 
today.
    And as a physician, I have seen firsthand the connection 
between a person's health and the environment where they live, 
and the very real effect of environmental injustices. 
Communities that face the biggest burdens are oftentimes 
marginalized, impoverished communities of color, and they have 
10 years less life expectancy who live in high-polluted, poor 
air quality communities than in other places that don't have 
the same pollution in their air. So it has real-life health 
impacts in the communities.
    Mr. Duffy, how would the EPA's proposed rule reduce 
pollution from power plants?
    Mr. Duffy. Sure. So this rule will significantly reduce 
pollution associated with especially the baseload plants but 
will also control those that are running less often.
    You know, this is--also, this is part of a whole suite of 
power sector rules. Some are more focused on hazardous air 
pollutants and local criteria pollutants. This, of course, is 
focused on CO<INF>2</INF>. It will have cobenefits associated 
with that. And as you mentioned, the impacts of climate change 
are falling most heavily on those overburdened communities 
already.
    The other thing EPA is doing in this rulemaking is to 
ensure active community engagement when these State plans are 
written such that, you know, the concerns of local communities 
can be brought to bear when power plants are--and States are 
considering how to move forward.
    Mr. Ruiz. Well, according to the American Lung 
Association's 2023 report card, my congressional district ranks 
as one of the worst for air pollution in the country. From a 
large volume of transportation, warehouse development, and air 
particulate matter from saline mineral dust in the Salton Sea 
region, the communities in my district suffer from a high rate 
of asthma and other respiratory health complications.
    Can you elaborate more on the engagement with local 
community partners?
    Mr. Duffy. Yes, yes. So EPA has in its proposal as well as 
a complementary rule, which is--it is called implementing--how 
to implement these sort of 111(d) rulemakings--has really 
elevated and made it clear that, you know, shallow community 
engagement is no longer sufficient for meeting the meaningful 
engagement requirements of the Clean Air Act. And so they will 
need to demonstrate in their plans that they have reached out 
to the communities that are most impacted, and that they have 
gotten sufficient input about concerns associated with the 
technologies, concerns associated with health, et cetera, such 
that the plans are reflective of those concerns.
    Mr. Ruiz. One of the biggest concerns are the cumulative 
impact of polluting projects, industries that come in, and 
taking an individual and assessing the increment of pollution 
that they add over time. Although the individual emission can 
meet certain criteria to allow them to pursue, over time you 
are just adding to a conglomerate of dirty air, which has 
significant impact.
    So where are we with assessing the cumulative impacts?
    Mr. Duffy. Right. I mean, I think that is why it is so 
important that Administrator Regan came in and said, you know, 
not only for communities but also for companies, we are going 
to set the rules of the road early with a lot of lead time and 
we are going to, you know, make sure that our fossil fleet is 
operating cleanly. We are going to do that by focusing on 
hazardous air pollutants, on the criteria of PM, ozone 
pollutants, and we are going to focus on climate pollution such 
that these can be comprehensive solutions that communities can 
engage with, power companies can plan, the grids can plan, the 
States can plan.
    Mr. Ruiz. As part of meaningful consultation, they bring 
community--and I have worked on this, especially during--with 
some of the Tribes that often experience check-the-box: We sent 
out a message and now we--you know, now, because they haven't 
responded, we have done our job.
    Mr. Duffy. Right.
    Mr. Ruiz. And it is a problem that we are dealing in in 
Energy, in this committee, with wanting to allow cable 
companies to do the same for Tribes to enter their land, to 
build, you know, on their land without their permission if they 
don't respond within 45 days.
    Mr. Duffy. Right.
    Mr. Ruiz. But part of the meaningful consultation means to 
have conversations about mitigation efforts in case something 
goes bad.
    Mr. Duffy. Right.
    Mr. Ruiz. Is that part of the necessity? So in case 
something goes bad, that the--those that pollute the area, the 
water--the air, in this case, can--there is some kind of 
accountability, some kind of recompense to the local 
communities?
    Mr. Duffy. Right. So in here EPA has enforcement authority, 
obviously, if they do not meet their standards. And if a plant 
has committed to retirement or to doing a CCS project, there 
are increments of progress to make sure that they are on a path 
to achieving those pollution reductions.
    Mr. Johnson. OK.
    Mr. Ruiz. Thank you.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you. The gentleman yields back. The 
Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Allen, for 
5 minutes.
    Mr. Allen. Thank you, Chairman Johnson, and--for holding 
this important hearing today. And I know we are all learning a 
lot, and as we discussed the Biden administration's proposed 
rule that would severely impact the reliability of our power 
grid and would shut down American energy.
    You know, this was going on under the Obama administration 
when I first was elected to Congress. My--all of my EMCs had 
spent millions of dollars putting in these scrubbers to meet 
that administration's rule. And, of course, now here we are. 
And so, you know, it is no doubt since President Biden's first 
days in office, he has launched a war on fossil fuel.
    And it occurred to me sitting in this hearing, you know, 
most of my district is rural. My air quality is excellent. In 
fact, I need carbon to grow my trees and my crops. And it seems 
like, to me, that the big problem is in these big, congested 
cities. They are the air quality problem. Why do people live 
there? I don't understand that. They can come to my rural 
America and have excellent quality of living--you know, the 
costs are much lower--and grow their own food.
    But anyway, the recent proposed rule by the Environmental 
Protection Agency, the Clean Power Plan 2.0, is one of this 
administration's latest attempts to end the use of natural gas 
in our Nation. We have heard today how detrimental this would 
be to the reliability of our grid.
    Mr. O'Loughlin, in your testimony you referenced the 
retire-or-else strategy of EPA compliance, where you can avoid 
excessive compliance costs--if compliance costs is even 
possible--by simply retiring units earlier than their planned 
service dates. That is a serious issue of reliability.
    Last month, I asked the EPA Administrator Regan about 
whether manufacturers, utilities, or others pay attention to 
potential future regulatory costs and compliance costs when 
making long-term decisions to maintain or expand operations. 
The more EPA signals and outlines what it plans for 
regulations, owners of facilities take that into account. And 
he agreed they did.
    We know from experience that some of EPA's rules will never 
be implemented, but that is not the problem. The problem is EPA 
appears to be sending as many signals as possible that future 
costs are going to increase. And with that, owners and 
investors will decide to shut down some power generation 
permanently. That is why I am so glad that we have Unit 3 in 
Georgia in my district running at 100 percent, the first 
nuclear power facility built. In fact, I tell my friends from 
California they are going to have to come to Georgia to charge 
their electric cars.
    You know, that is the entire--that is the retire-or-else 
strategy. Administrator Regan refused to say that that was the 
case, but from the evidence of all the compliance requirements 
across all the rules that the EPA has presented, utilities and 
power producers, do you think that is what is going on, Mr. 
Nasi, Mr. Snitchler? Would you both like to share your thoughts 
on this?
    Mr. Nasi. Yes, I mean, I will start with I do a lot of work 
in rural America. Rural electric cooperatives are trying to 
serve their populations, and they are having to make these 
difficult decisions. And as Mr. O'Loughlin has done a great job 
of articulating, you can't sit around that board table and make 
multimillion, multihundred-million-dollar decisions to keep a 
facility going if you have no idea whether you are going to 
live out its useful life. Otherwise, you have to accelerate 
that expenditure onto the ratepayers.
    So I think it is a very intentional effort, frankly, by the 
administration----
    Mr. Allen. Yes.
    Mr. Nasi [continuing]. To create that kind of uncertainty.
    Mr. Allen. To punish rural America, yes.
    Mr. Snitchler?
    Mr. Snitchler. I think one of the challenges that you bump 
into is also that not every resource is the same in that 
utilities have a different business model than independent 
power producers do. And we don't have captive customers on 
which we can rely to recover those costs over any period of 
time.
    And so when a rule has additional costs or expenses that 
are going to be incurred on the part of the shareholders or the 
investors, then business decisions have to be made about 
whether you are going to continue to operate that, whether you 
are going to continue to make investments to prolong its life, 
or you make the business decision to say it is more cost 
effective to retire it.
    Mr. Allen. I mean, is this a responsible use of EPA's Clean 
Air Act authorities, Mr. Snitchler?
    Mr. Snitchler. I won't opine as to whether it is an 
appropriate or reasonable use. We find ourselves in the 
position of having to comply with whatever the rules are. And 
the challenge I think we find with this rule is that, unlike 
the last Clean Power Plan proposal under the Obama 
administration, there isn't a coal fleet that can retire and a 
natural gas fleet that will be able to support the system. If 
this rule is implemented and it has a negative effect on 
natural gas resources, we don't have sufficient wind, solar, 
and nuclear to power the country.
    Mr. Allen. Thank you. Thank you so much for your time and 
your expertise.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Balderson [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Allen. Next up is 
Mr. Peters from California.
    Mr. Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess I have been 
around here a while now. When I first came in, the argument the 
industry was making was for clean coal, and the 
environmentalists were very skeptical of carbon capture. Today 
the administration is asking for clean coal and the 
environmentalists like carbon capture. And in fact, carbon 
capture and sequestration is a clean energy technology that is 
supported by Republicans and Democrats and now a diverse group 
of industries.
    In 2020 I was proud to coauthor the USE IT Act with my 
Republican colleague from West Virginia--California and West 
Virginia working together--Dave McKinley. That passed in the 
spending bill. In 2021 the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act provided $12 billion in new investments for CCS, 
and the Inflation Reduction Act made the strongest investment 
in CCS to date by increasing the existing CCS tax credit to $85 
per ton.
    As I said, environmentalists had been very skeptical of 
this, and now we are trying to offer it, and it is--now it is 
getting resistance.
    So despite major technological advancements and broad 
support for CCS, my colleagues apparently are choosing to 
undermine the technology today. But to be very clear, CCS will 
be a cost-effective approach to complying with the proposed EPA 
power plant standards, and the proposed rule is a reasonable, 
flexible approach to reducing climate pollution while 
maintaining an affordable and reliable electric grid.
    Beyond the specifics of the rule, I would share my concern 
about ensuring that our power system is reliable. I do believe 
we have major challenges ahead of us, particularly with 
increasingly severe weather events.
    I would just offer that one of the best ways to improve 
grid reliability is interregional electric transmission, which 
can improve reliability by making more power resources 
available to grid operators across more geographic locations so 
if extreme weather hits one State, a robust system of 
interregional transmission helps ensure that the power stays on 
and the costs stay low. And that transmission doesn't 
discriminate among energy sources. The imported power could 
come from coal, gas, nuclear, hydro, solar, wind, whatever.
    The research is clear that interregional transmission is 
essential to maintaining an affordable, reliable power system, 
and we are terrible at building it today. We are bad at it. 
According to the Americans for a Clean Energy Grid, North 
America has built just 7 gigawatts of interregional 
transmission, and less than half of that in the United States. 
Since 2014, 7. South America has built 22; Europe, 44; and 
China, 260.
    And that is largely a permitting and siting issue. For 
example, the Department of the Interior recently approved the 
TransWest transmission line, which will carry power from 
Wyoming to California, to begin construction. The permitting 
took 15 years. So I invite my colleagues on the other side to 
work with us to advance bipartisan transmission policies for 
liability and for better cost for consumers and for a stable 
grid.
    So back to this rule. The Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change found that carbon capture and sequestration, or 
CCS, will be an essential technology to reach our climate goals 
by mid-century. Mr. Duffy, can you elaborate on the role that 
CCS will play in a decarbonized energy system?
    Mr. Duffy. Sure. So this is more broadly. The, you know, 
leading climate experts, economists, energy systems experts say 
that carbon capture and sequestration is an essential tool 
needed to cut carbon pollution and address climate change. The 
International Energy Agency has reached the exact same 
conclusion, calling it impossible to meet our goals without 
CCS.
    Mr. Peters. Do you agree with EPA's determination that CCS 
should be considered a best system of emission reductions under 
their proposed rule?
    Mr. Duffy. I do. As I have said, you know, it is a 
technology-forcing, forward-looking statute, and there is 
sufficient evidence that the technology is available to be 
deployed.
    Mr. Peters. I don't begrudge or--in any way--the industry's 
skepticism or their statement of a difficulty of complying. But 
I just want you to touch on the research defending CCS as a 
cost-effective emissions control technology. Can you comment on 
that for me?
    Mr. Duffy. Sure, sure. So DOE and NETL have recently done--
released studies on the costs of CCS. Those are the costs that 
EPA uses in this rulemaking. Their cost estimate for 90 percent 
CCS, including transport and storage and considering 45Q, is 
$11 a ton for existing gas plants. You are up $22 a ton for 
existing coal plants and up $15 a ton for new gas plants.
    Now, that is the low end and assumes a high capacity 
factor, but EPA undertook a conservative approach, still found 
it well within the line of comparable pollution controls like 
scrubbers.
    Mr. Peters. And I would just conclude by saying again to my 
colleagues, I am happy to talk about reliability, and I do 
think we face real challenges. I just want that conversation to 
include transmission as a focus.
    And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Balderson. Thank you, Mr. Peters. Next is me, next in 
line.
    Welcome, the two Ohio boys. This is like old times, isn't 
it?
    Thank you all for being here, not only the Ohio ones. But 
my first question is for Mr. O'Loughlin, and I would like to 
follow up on a point that Mr. Carter raised earlier.
    Regardless of future actions or issues that may arise with 
litigation down the road, how does the EPA's latest carbon 
proposal impact the planning and investments for your members 
in Ohio today and the near future?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. Thank you, Congressman. It clearly creates 
a stranded cost risk for us today and also going into the 
future. It also creates a reliability risk, as the timeframe 
that has been laid out is not something that we can meet. And I 
think we have looked at other studies. We have been watching 
carbon capture technology for some time. It is at least 7 to 10 
years to put a system into place in a commercial basis if it 
would work, which is unclear to us at this time. And the rule 
requires it by 2030, and there is just no way we can make that.
    So we are not able to invest in something that can't be on 
time, and we don't know what the cost will be because, 
ultimately, we are accountable to our consumers for recovery of 
that cost, and that is just not a wise use of their funds. And 
it is going to have a reliability impact, because it is going 
to force--if it is enacted as proposed, it is going to force 
the retirement of several units like ours that right now 
provide the backbone of a reliable electric system.
    Mr. Balderson. OK. Thank you. Continuing, Mr. O'Loughlin, 
as you know, the PJM report that came out a few months ago 
shows that 40 gigawatts of existing generation in the region 
are at risk of retirement by 2030, which you somewhat just 
explained there. Do you think renewables can make up for more 
retirements that will be forced because of this policy?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. Well, I don't and, more importantly, I 
think PJM does not. And I also think NERC and pretty much 
anybody else that has looked at it has realized that we are not 
going to be able to site and build that much--interconnect that 
much in that timeframe and also that it doesn't provide the 
same reliability services that the existing baseload fleet 
provides and--because of its intermittent nature.
    And so I think, again, I would say it would be a great idea 
for EPA to allow some independent analysis of the reliability 
impacts so that you can hear differing views on it, but why not 
take a little bit of time and let the independent authorities 
like PJM, like NERC go ahead and study it and tell us what they 
think? Because that prediction they made was even prior to this 
rule being issued. So--and I think it is hard to see that it 
wouldn't have a further negative impact on reliability.
    Mr. Balderson. Speaking for Ohio, in terms of potential 
rate increases, blackouts, or general reliability concerns, is 
that all part of it too?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. It sure is. You know, so I was here a 
couple of months ago. Last Christmas Eve we were very close to 
having rolling blackouts. We had mandatory conservation 
requests. And we have retired 5,000 megawatts within PJM just 
since December. And so we are at a tipping point on reliability 
today in Ohio, and we have retired--we used to have 21 coal-
fired power plants in 2009 operating in Ohio. Today we have 
four. We have lost about 15,000 megawatts of capacity. About 
half of that has been replaced with other sources. And we 
continue to see this having a further negative effect.
    Mr. Balderson. Thank you.
    Mr. Snitchler, as you know, I recently introduced the Grid 
Reliability and Resiliency Improvement Act, which would require 
NERC, in consultation with FERC, the Department of Energy, and 
RTOs and ISOs, to issue a report every 2 years addressing long-
term reliability concerns with the electric grid.
    The PJM report that we have discussed came out months 
before the EPA's tailpipe emissions proposal and this Clean 
Power Plan 2.0. So the EPA is actively increasing demand while 
forcing retirements and taking resources offline.
    Do you think it would be a good policy for the agencies 
responsible for ensuring grid reliability and the operators of 
the bulk power system report back to us on potential issues and 
threatened grid reliability?
    Mr. Snitchler. It would seem to me that having the people 
who are most closely aligned and responsible for reliability 
ought to be the ones who are advising Members of Congress about 
what the situation is on the ground. And so we would strongly 
support that type of information being provided by 
dispassionate third parties that allow you to make wise policy 
choices instead of having aspirational goals get ahead of 
operational realities.
    Mr. Balderson. I will follow up with that. And in the same 
vein, we know the EPA is issuing these proposals without 
providing detailed information on how they will impact 
reliability. That is the concern I raised with Administrator 
Regan a few weeks ago before the--before this subcommittee. Do 
you think it would make sense for NERC to provide an 
independent assessment before EPA rules affecting the power 
sector are finalized and go into effect?
    Mr. Snitchler. I think it would be helpful to have all of 
the information. NERC has been providing updates for years and 
warnings for at least the last 4 or 5 years about reliability 
concerns that it sees, so their involvement and engagement in 
rulemaking to at least have an eyes-wide-open approach seems 
like that would be an informed way for rulemakings to proceed.
    Mr. Balderson. OK. Thank you all very much. I yield back my 
time and I yield now to the gentlelady from California, Ms. 
Barragan.
    Ms. Barragan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The EPA's new carbon pollution standards for power plants 
is important for the U.S. efforts to fight the climate crisis 
and to reduce air pollution in communities of color. Ninety 
percent of the top 50 polluters are power plants that burn coal 
or gas. Many are in low-income communities and communities of 
color.
    Mr. Duffy, how will the EPA proposed carbon pollution 
standards benefit environmental justice communities?
    Mr. Duffy. Sure. So this is part of a whole suite of EPA 
actions focusing on local pollutants, hazardous pollutants. And 
this, of course, is focused on CO<INF>2</INF>, which has broad 
implications, but of course environmental justice communities 
are--have a--are shouldering a heavier burden of the impacts.
    This rule also, you know, has cobenefits that--particulate 
matter and other pollutants that will impact public health, 
also requires meaningful engagement during the State planning 
process.
    Ms. Barragan. Well, thank you. I can tell you that in my 
congressional district doctors' offices and the clinics have 
asthma inhalers, like, stocked up in boxes because they are 
expecting more children there to come in who have developed 
asthma because of the air pollution and the impact there.
    Mr. Duffy, why is it important that existing gas plants 
were included in the proposed rule?
    Mr. Duffy. Yes, thank you for this question. It is really 
important.
    First is because the Clean Air Act requires it. EPA set 
standards for new gas plants in 2015. That sets a--that 
triggers a responsibility to set standards for the existing gas 
fleet.
    Second, in 2022 the gas fleet emitted 661 million metric 
tons of CO<INF>2</INF>. That is 43 percent of total sector 
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions. The emissions from the gas fleet have 
increased by 65 percent since 2010.
    And third, not covering the existing gas fleet is kind of 
robbing Peter to pay Paul. You end up just leaking all of the 
emissions from, you know, from coal and the other sources 
that--sectors that are regulated, and the existing gas fleet 
will just run more. And that is unacceptable when there is a 
pollution control that is cost reasonable and available.
    Ms. Barragan. Thank you. One of the concerns that I have is 
that only the largest gas plants that run the most frequently 
are covered.
    Mr. Duffy. Yes.
    Ms. Barragan. However, smaller gas plants that mainly run 
during the hottest summer months can cause unhealthy air in 
frontline communities. How important is it for our climate and 
environmental justice efforts for the EPA to strengthen the 
rule to cover more gas power plants?
    Mr. Duffy. Very important. And we are looking at that and 
will likely be advocating for expanded coverage. Right now, EPA 
is proposing to cover 7 percent of the natural gas units. They 
are requesting comment on taking a--on covering a larger 
portion, and that would end up covering 80 percent of emissions 
if it was down to what--the lowest thing that they are taking 
comment on, which is, I think, 100 megawatts and 40 percent 
capacity factor.
    Ms. Barragan. Great, thank you. Mr. Duffy, there has also 
been support from the White House for a more ambitious timeline 
of 2035 for coal plants to curb emissions by 90 percent or 
retire, rather than year 2040. It is a faster timeline 
feasible, and should this rule be strengthened to include it?
    Mr. Duffy. Yes, I--well, I am trying to get the timelines 
right. I think if you--for coal, if you retire by 2040 you need 
to start--you need to install--if you retire after 2040, the 
compliance period is 2030. For gas it is out to 2035. So with 
gas, with the gas fleet, yes.
    I think there are places where these big kind of carbon 
capture, hydrogen pollution control technologies will need time 
to build out, to construct, to get permitted, et cetera. But 
the other pollution standards that are associated with 
efficiencies and fuels, those can be done on a shorter 
timeline.
    Ms. Barragan. And Mr. Duffy, is there anything else that 
you haven't been asked today, or information that you think 
should be shared with the public?
    Mr. Duffy. No, I think, you know, the agency is doing 
exactly what the Supreme Court told it to do. It is basing 
reasonable standards for the biggest polluters on traditional 
inside-the-fence approaches that are going to cause these power 
plants to operate more cleanly and protect public health.
    Ms. Barragan. Well, thank you. Thank you for your work. You 
know, I am a big advocate for environmental justice communities 
to make sure that we all have access to clean air and to be 
able to breathe clean air. We have seen the health impacts. I 
have heard from constituents and people across the country who 
just want to breathe clean air and who are seeing the impacts 
to climate and these emissions. So thank you.
    With that, I yield back.
    Mr. Balderson. Thank you. I now turn it over to the 
gentleman from Texas, Mr. Pfluger.
    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the 
witnesses for being here.
    This is a national security issue. We are literally facing 
decisions and a pacing of the decisions that will lead us to a 
grid that not only is unreliable, but it will make the winter 
storms and the other events that we have seen recently, 
honestly, look like a junior-varsity exercise when you have a 
lack of dispatchable and readily available energy.
    I will start by saying that in the last 10 years a billion 
people have been lifted out of poverty worldwide, and that has 
happened because we have affordable, reliable energy that is 
able to get to places like sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian 
subcontinent, and other places in the world that have never had 
energy before. So the fact that we are literally facing rule 
after rule after rule from unelected bureaucrats who are not 
cooperating, communicating, or consulting with industry, with 
communities, with Congress is unbelievable.
    Our current baseload, annual baseload, demands about 4 
trillion kilowatt hours per year. And so my question--I will 
start with Mr. Nasi.
    I really enjoyed your testimony, and all of you. Does the 
EPA or the Department of Energy have a plan for providing 
baseload power when you look at what they are trying to do with 
this latest rule?
    Mr. Nasi. Well, I mean, first and foremost, it is EPA's 
statutory obligation to evaluate those impacts but not to do so 
in a silo. And that is one of the fundamental things that I 
think you have heard many of us say, is that this thing needs 
to be rebooted with real consultation, not just with NERC, 
FERC, but also with the regional transmission organizations 
and, ultimately, those who have the sovereign power over the 
grids: the States. It is the exclusion of the States that is 
the biggest problem to me, as a practitioner, because we are 
the ones who actually are on the ground keeping the grid alive, 
as you know. We both experienced Winter Storm Uri.
    So it is a problem, and so they need to start over. And 
frankly, before they do a rule they should evaluate what is 
possible, not try to rationalize how we might get out of it 
after they have already cooked the rule.
    Mr. Pfluger. Do you think that they have a plan?
    Mr. Nasi. They----
    Mr. Pfluger. And have they done the math?
    Mr. Nasi. They have models. And I have already said their 
models explicitly contradict the data and the actual real-world 
expectations of power plant operators. And it is not the first 
time.
    We try to work with the EPA to improve their models. I 
think there is a lot of well-intentioned people at EPA, but the 
fact is that this rule has a model that doesn't measure up to 
reality.
    Mr. Pfluger. Mr. O'Loughlin--thank you for that. Mr. 
O'Loughlin, do you think that the EPA has done the math on what 
is going to be required, supplywise, to meet demand?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. Well, they have done some modeling, and I 
would just suggest that they take the time and go ahead and let 
the independent reliability experts, the ISOs like PJM, NERC go 
ahead and do an independent reliability assessment, and let's 
just see what an independent view of that looks like.
    Mr. Pfluger. A couple of weeks ago, we had the Secretary of 
Energy before this committee, the full committee, and I asked 
her what the demand would grow to if the 2032 EV mandate took 
place. And I quote: ``It would double.''
    Do we have the ability to service a doubling of electricity 
demand with this EPA rule, Mr. O'Loughlin?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. Yes, we are strained today. We don't--this 
is not going to enable the baseload capacity that we are going 
to need to meet greater demand.
    And oh, by the way, you know, carbon capture requires about 
25 percent of the output of a power plant to operate, hydrogen 
is electrolysis, green--is a very electric-intensive activity, 
so those would be further demands on the electric system that 
we would see placed through this rule.
    Mr. Pfluger. Why are companies shutting down their carbon 
capture plants, carbon capture, you know, features of 
production plants right now?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. Yes, well, I am not intimately familiar, 
but I do understand that the two that have been operating in 
North America are--largely have been providing for enhanced oil 
recovery as part of their economic stream, which is unclear 
that this rule would even allow for that, which we haven't 
really talked much about, but it also requires storage of 
carbon dioxide, which is something that is definitely unproven 
at the scale that is being requested here.
    Mr. Pfluger. And I think that is the reason.
    And Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit for the record a 
letter from the Texas General Land Office to the EPA 
highlighting Dr. Buckingham's extreme concern with the EPA's 
implementation of this Clean Power Plan 2.0.
    Mr. Johnson [presiding]. Without objection, so ordered.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr. Pfluger. You know, the--I just spoke with the CEO, one 
of your colleagues, Mr. O'Loughlin, just a few minutes ago 
outside. And I think the answer to this question of why carbon 
capture is not working is because it is not financially 
sustainable. It doesn't work. Without the funds and the 
subsidies, it doesn't work. In fact, the only carbon pollution 
that I think is dangerous at this point in time is that which 
fills the halls of Congress with the hot air that comes out and 
doesn't actually look at the financial and economic impacts to 
our country.
    So I appreciate everyone's testimony today. We have to do 
the math. And if Secretary Granholm is right and energy demand 
is going to double, then this is a terrible plan that we would 
be--we would not suit our constituents well by not pushing back 
on it.
    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentleman from Idaho, Mr. Fulcher, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Fulcher. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And to the panel, 
thank you for your flexibility. We, as you probably know, we 
have got dueling committees today. And so what I ask may be a 
rerun, and so for that I will ask for forgiveness in advance.
    But, Mr. O'Loughlin, I just caught the tail end of your 
comments on this last go-around here. And given this Clean 
Power Plan, can electric generating units realistically and 
economically achieve these--this Biden administration goal and 
the timeline, given this new set of rules?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. Yes, well, my understanding of the timeline 
is the answer is no to that on the timeline. I think it is 
unclear and undemonstrated whether carbon capture will be able 
to provide the level that is being requested. But what we have 
today has not been demonstrated.
    And so it is very difficult for small companies like ours 
and others to invest in projects that are unclear whether they 
will work and that are unclear whether they can meet the 
timelines that are required and it is unclear whether they can 
meet the standards that are required, even if they do work. So 
it makes it something that we can't in good faith spend our 
member consumers' money on.
    Mr. Fulcher. Just to follow up that, do you know if--how 
many coal-fired plants, how many natural-gas-fired plants will 
be forced to retire as a function----
    Mr. O'Loughlin. Yes----
    Mr. Fulcher [continuing]. Of this?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. I don't know the answer to that. I know EPA 
has modeled some things, but I would expect it would be nearly 
all the coal-fired power plants would have to retire in this 
country if this rule is implemented. There are a few that have 
already begun working on carbon capture projects that might 
have a chance of at least trying to put those in service. But 
most of the industry can't possibly meet this timeline for coal 
plants.
    Natural gas has a little bit longer, so it is a little less 
clear to me what they--whether they will be able to do it. But 
I think the bigger question is whether they will be willing to 
invest the money in this unproven technology.
    Mr. Fulcher. Thank you for that.
    Mr. Nasi, I am going to direct this to you. I know you have 
got some legal background, but if there is someone else on the 
panel that wants to take a crack at it, I am perfectly fine 
with that too. Permitting seems to be such a significant issue. 
I can tell you in my State, whether it be power plants or any 
kind of a project, you name it, the permitting always is an 
issue.
    Do you think, given the--what you understand about this 
rule, this new set of rules, will electric companies be able to 
build and obtain the permits for CCS hydrogen infrastructure 
that is required, moving forward?
    Mr. Nasi. Yes, I mean, as a practitioner in the space, 
there is no possibility that we will be able to permit the 
scale of pipeline infrastructure necessary to actually 
transport CO<INF>2</INF> to storage facilities across the 
entire fleet, or even a significant component of it.
    And, you know, the congressman from California raised the 
point about permitting and how it takes 15 years to do a 
transmission line. Welcome to pipeline construction. We know 
they are not exactly noncontroversial. Rural America has--I 
think, correctly--got rights to actually stand up against 
condemnation when it doesn't make sense.
    And so it--projects are hard, and they take a long time. We 
don't mandate technology requirements based on the hope that 
all that is going to work out and we are going to do it three 
times faster than we ever have. That is just not the way the 
Clean Air Act works.
    Mr. Fulcher. Yes, thank you for that. I have got a minute 
left.
    Mr. Duffy, Mr. Snitchler, if either of you would like to 
comment on that, you are certainly welcome in the minute I have 
got left.
    Mr. Duffy. I would just say, I mean, you will get no 
argument from me that permitting, you know, needs to be 
expedited, but it needs to be done in an environmentally 
conscious way.
    But as far as, you know, Class 6 permits and things like 
that, we certainly need to ensure that the infrastructure that 
will support this transition is able to be built out.
    Mr. Fulcher. OK.
    Mr. Snitchler. I think it is clear that there are a lot of 
knock-on effects to this proposed rule that would require 
significant amounts of investment: permitting, siting, 
construction, labor, all of the materials that will be required 
that I don't think are properly accounted for in the timeline 
that has been established.
    Mr. Fulcher. Thank you for that. Thank you to the panel.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. Would the gentleman yield?
    Mr. Fulcher. Yes, I will yield.
    Mr. Johnson. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to 
follow up on a question that I asked and I, if I could, just 
get a quick yes-or-no answer from you folks.
    Do you see the inability to heat our homes in freezing 
winter temperatures, the inability to cool our homes in the 
heat of the summer in rural Appalachia, and the inability to 
cook our food because we don't have electricity because of 
brownouts or blackouts--do you see that as a public health 
problem, Mr. O'Loughlin?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. I do, and I would say that the lower-income 
portion of the people that we serve are the most negatively 
affected by that.
    Mr. Johnson. OK. Mr. Snitchler?
    Mr. Snitchler. I would agree that that is a public health 
problem.
    Mr. Johnson. Mr. Duffy?
    Mr. Duffy. Yes.
    Mr. Johnson. OK, thank you.
    Mr. Nasi. Yes.
    Mr. Johnson. Mr. Nasi? OK, thank you.
    I yield back, and with that----
    Mr. Fulcher. I----
    Mr. Johnson [presiding]. I now recognize the gentlelady 
from Iowa, Dr. Miller-Meeks.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I thank all of 
our witnesses for being here.
    First, let me state--because I do this at every hearing we 
have on Energy and Commerce--that Iowa is a State where over 50 
percent of its energy is from renewables. We are now almost up 
to 60 percent of our electricity is from wind, and we are an 
exporter of energy. Despite that, last year there was concern 
that we were going to have brownouts and rolling blackouts in 
Iowa from a lack of energy.
    And so as I think about this entire process and I watched 
what unveiled in Europe this past winter and their energy 
crisis in Europe, which was already imposed upon very high 
electricity prices, and then when I think about the EPA's 
recently proposed greenhouse gas emissions standards for coal 
and natural-gas-fired power plants, I have immediate concerns 
about our ability to ensure electric reliability and meet 
increased energy demand in the United States, which--we know 
demand is going up. At both COP26 and COP27 they readily 
admitted demand is going up.
    And I also think about the consequences of power shortages. 
Of course, it varies by region, but there are several days if 
not months of the year that heating and cooling American's 
homes is not a luxury but a necessity. In fact, a 2012 study 
showed that the installation of air conditioning in American 
homes is the reason why the chances of dying on an extremely 
hot day fell 80 percent over the past half-century.
    In a previous hearing at the Energy Subcommittee, I spoke 
about the lives lost globally each year from heat and cold. 
Lancet and Wall Street Journal articles in 2021 indicated 
exposure to hot or cold temperatures is associated with over 5 
million premature deaths globally each year. Heat death is 
responsible for about 1 percent of global fatalities, 600,000, 
but cold kills 8 times as many people, 4.5 million annually.
    A 2019 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research 
estimates that, by driving down gas prices, the fracking 
revolution saved more than 11,000 American lives annually since 
2010. Natural gas, targeted by the EPA's proposed rule, 
provided 40 percent of the electricity nationally in 2022. And 
as we have already heard, Secretary Granholm estimated that the 
demand for electricity would double with the emission standards 
yielding to electric vehicles.
    If the U.S. does not have the energy to make up what the 
EPA proposes to take offline with this rule, it will cost 
lives, not just harm the economy. It is not pie in the sky.
    It is always puzzling to me as a doctor that--Mr. Duffy, do 
you think our air is cleaner than it was 15 years ago?
    Mr. Duffy. Yes.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. So our air is vastly cleaner than it was 
15 years ago, but yet my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle want to continually allude to increasing asthma rates, 
and it has puzzled me. We are saving lives because of air 
conditioning and heating because we have affordable, reliable 
electricity, but yet we have cleaner air and asthma is going 
up. Maybe we did the wrong thing in the EPA.
    Mr. O'Loughlin, the North American Electric Reliability 
Corporation, NERC, and RTOs like PJM have warned that energy 
availability and electric reliability in the United States are 
already at risk as of today. EPA's proposed ruling would place 
further restrictions on power plants that would force early 
closures of key baseload energy facilities. Looking to the 
future, McKinsey's estimated that electricity demand is 
expected to triple by 2050.
    How will the United States be able to meet the significant 
increase in demand if EPA's regulations are finalized?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. Well, that is a great question. I wish I 
had a great answer for you, because I am not really sure how we 
will be able to meet increased demand with diminished electric 
supply.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Does anyone know what the carbon 
emissions are from the mining of lithium, cobalt, rare earth 
elements that go into a solar panel, or the steel for 
manufacturing for wind turbines, or the petroleum that goes 
into wind turbines for their--or the disposal of those said 
units when their life expectancy is expired? Do we know the 
carbon emissions? Mr. Duffy, do you know the carbon emissions?
    Mr. Duffy. I know that there is there is no silver bullet, 
and that all of these----
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. So you have taken that into account at 
the EPA?
    Mr. Duffy. EPA's job is to look at these power plants and 
determine the best system of pollution control for those power 
plants.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. So you don't care about the pollution 
control of other sources of energy?
    Mr. Duffy. We certainly do. But what we are talking about 
today is the rule at issue here.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Thank you. And Mr. Snitchler, how will 
the closure of natural gas production affect our carbon 
emissions?
    Mr. Snitchler. Natural gas has led to the largest reduction 
in emissions in U.S. history. Since 2005, restructured regions 
around the country have had emissions dropped by north of 35 
percent. So we are actually going in the wrong direction if we 
try to eliminate natural gas, which has been the largest driver 
of reduced emissions.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Chair, I yield back my time.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Obernolte, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Obernolte. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
Thank you to our witnesses. This is a very important hearing on 
a very important topic.
    Mr. O'Loughlin, thanks for your testimony. I would like to 
kind of narrow down exactly what we mean when we talk about the 
fact that electricity prices would increase should this rule be 
implemented. Can you tell us what the--your average current 
customer pays for a kilowatt hour of electricity and how much 
that would go up should this rule become law?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. Yes. Our average price today in Ohio for 
electricity in a rural cooperative is between 13 and 14 cents a 
kilowatt hour, which is pretty close to the national average. 
And most of that, about two-thirds of that cost, is made up of 
the cost of production of generating that electricity.
    I wish I could tell you how much our costs would increase 
if we had to implement this rule, but unfortunately, I am 
unable to estimate that because I am not really sure what we 
are going to do to replace our electricity and what the market 
conditions for electricity will likely be if we have a 
shortage, other than I know it will be considerably higher than 
it is today.
    We would replace some with some renewables at a somewhat 
higher cost, and we would be forced to close our plants and 
have stranded assets which we would need to continue to recover 
for the next 10 or 12 years from our member consumers. And then 
we would be purchasing electricity to make up the difference in 
a constrained market, which I expect would be significantly 
higher than today's market prices.
    Mr. Obernolte. So, I mean, it stands to reason by a 
substantial increase we are not talking about a cent or two per 
kilowatt hour.
    Mr. O'Loughlin. Yes.
    Mr. Obernolte. We are talking about something more 
substantial.
    Mr. O'Loughlin. I would expect it to be much more 
substantial than----
    Mr. Obernolte. Like doubling?
    Mr. O'Loughlin. Like--yes, I would be speculating at that 
point, but it would be easy to see it going up 50 percent or 
more, yes.
    Mr. Obernolte. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Duffy, it--I was very interested in your testimony. And 
by the way, thank you for being here. It is not easy to be the 
opposite--the opposition witness, I know.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Duffy. I appreciate that.
    Mr. Obernolte. You used a couple of terms multiple times. 
You used the words ``affordable'' and ``cost reasonable.''
    Mr. Duffy. Mm-hmm.
    Mr. Obernolte. So is a 50 percent increase in the cost of 
energy, is that affordable and cost reasonable?
    Mr. Duffy. I don't know about that. But I do know what EPA 
did estimate as the electricity price increases. The Inflation 
Reduction Act reduces electricity prices 4 percent. There is a 
2 percent increase in retail price in 2030, which goes down to 
a quarter of a percentage increase by 2035, and .08 percent 
increase in 2040 associated with EPA's modeling for this rule.
    Mr. Obernolte. I am sorry, you lost me there. The EPA 
believes that their rule would decrease the cost of 
electricity?
    Mr. Duffy. No, this is a 2 percent increase. I was saying 
the Inflation Reduction Act, in and of itself----
    Mr. Obernolte. Sure, sure. We are talking about this 
proposed rule, you know, in isolation.
    Mr. Duffy. Yes. So in isolation, a 2 percent increase in 
retail price, 2030; a less than a quarter percent increase in 
2035; and .08 percent in 2040. The benefits of this rule 
outweigh the costs 7 to 1.
    Mr. Obernolte. OK. Mr. O'Loughlin, who is the expert 
because he runs a co-op that does energy generation, just 
testified that it is going to increase costs 50 percent for his 
customers. Do you--is that wrong?
    Mr. Duffy. I don't have the background information to know 
if that is wrong or right. All I can go by is what EPA has 
modeled here.
    Mr. Obernolte. OK. Well, I mean----
    Mr. Duffy. I am sure he is being forthright, but I don't 
know the----
    Mr. Obernolte. There is----
    Mr. Duffy [continuing]. Background.
    Mr. Obernolte. I am just saying that there is a huge 
disparity between the EPA saying, you know, a 2 percent cost 
increase and system operators saying a 50 percent cost 
increase.
    OK, well, you know, let me just, in the time I have got, 
illustrate something that is very poignant for the people that 
I represent. I represent a lot of folks that are on a fixed 
income, they are retired. They struggle to pay their bills. My 
hometown--I wish, Mr. O'Loughlin, that I lived in your service 
area, because my local electric provider just submitted a rate 
case to the California Public Utility Commission asking for 
base electric rates to be increased over 40 cents a kilowatt 
hour.
    Every time those rates go up, more and more of the folks 
that I represent get driven into poverty. There was a study 
that just occurred a couple of months ago that said that over a 
third of Americans have had to choose between paying an energy 
bill and paying for other household goods in the last year. You 
know, that should be meaningful to everybody.
    So we are all protectors of our environment. We want to be 
good stewards of our planet. You know, we have to balance the 
requirement to do that with also the requirement to provide 
basic necessities to the people that live here. And it is going 
to be a balance. It can't be all of one or the other.
    And my problem with this proposed rule, an increase of 50 
percent does not seem affordable or cost reasonable to me. And 
so I really think it needs to be rethought and reexamined. But 
I want to thank you very much for your testimony.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back. And seeing there 
are no further Members asking--wishing to ask questions, I 
would like to thank, once again, all of our witnesses from--for 
being here today.
    I ask unanimous consent to insert in the record the 
documents included on the staff hearing documents list.
    Without objection, that will be the order.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr. Johnson. Pursuant to committee rules, I will remind 
Members that they have 10 business days to submit additional 
questions for the record, and I ask that witnesses submit their 
response within 10 business days upon receipt of the questions.
    Without objection, the subcommittee is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:59 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
    [Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:]
