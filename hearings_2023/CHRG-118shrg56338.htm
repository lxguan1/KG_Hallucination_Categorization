STATEMENT OF HON. DEBBIE STABENOW, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE 
    OF MICHIGAN, CHAIRWOMAN, U.S. COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, 
                    NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well good morning. I call this hearing 
of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and 
Forestry to order. Welcome to our witnesses. Thank you all for 
being here today.
    American agriculture has always been at the forefront of 
innovation, and artificial intelligence has the potential to 
revolutionize the way we grow, harvest, and distribute our 
crops. In this rapidly evolving landscape, it is imperative 
that we strike a balance between harnessing the benefits 
Artifical Intelligence (AI) offers while addressing the 
concerns it raises, such as data privacy, work force 
implications, and equitable access to technological 
advancements.
    Our discussion today will help us navigate this intricate 
path, ensuring that American agriculture remains sustainable, 
competitive, and resilient in the face of a changing world.
    The reality is that artificial intelligence is already 
being integrated into our daily lives. In fact--I am going to 
pause--my Statement up to this point was entirely generated by 
AI, and it is something I would have said, so it is incredible, 
actually, to me. I did not ask them to put my voice with it, so 
we are not sure how that would have worked.
    This just shows us how real this technology and its 
implications can be. It is opening new pathways to address the 
climate crisis, increase production, lower input costs, and 
automate planting and harvesting.
    Tractors that scan for weeds and apply targeted herbicides, 
harvesting machines that use AI to determine ripeness in real 
time and autonomously pick crops, and systems that integrate 
satellite and soil data to more efficiently apply fertilizer 
are not in the realm of science fiction. These technologies are 
being put to use on farms across the country today, and we will 
hear more about it today. These are exciting opportunities, and 
this Committee must work to ensure that America does not fall 
behind.
    USDA is taking steps to explore the future of this 
technology. For example, the National Institute of Food and 
Agriculture is investing in cutting-edge research to study how 
we can apply AI to some of American agriculture's greatest 
challenges.
    We must also be cautious about the significant risks. 
Placing vast amounts of data in the hands of a few private 
companies could accelerate the trend of consolidation in the 
agricultural industry or perpetuate bias that has harmed small 
farmers and farmers of color for decades.
    High costs are putting AI and precision agriculture 
technology out of reach for everyone except the largest 
operations. We must work to ensure that its application does 
not force even more small and medium-sized farms out of 
business by ensuring that there is fair access to its benefits.
    I also remain concerned that a small handful of companies 
that provide this technology will be the same companies that 
sell the fertilizer and seeds that their technology recommends 
as a solution. Farmers should be the ones benefiting from their 
data, not big corporations.
    I cannot allow the opportunity pass to remind everyone that 
this technology cannot work on farms if we do not continue to 
extend the reach of broadband and high-speed internet into 
every rural community, the very best quality possible.
    There is a tremendous opportunity to use this technology to 
bring new and high-paying jobs into rural communities. This 
opportunity should not be forfeited to big cities, but it 
should have a chance to thrive in the heartland where it is 
being put to use in fields and on farms across the country.
    I am glad that President Biden issued an Executive order as 
a first step to managing these kinds of risks. I am grateful 
that Majority Leader Schumer has initiated a thoughtful 
bipartisan effort so that we in the Senate can fully evaluate 
the potential risks and benefits of AI in every part of our 
lives and our economy. The responsibility of this Committee is 
to understand the implications of regulating this technology on 
farms and in our food system.
    We also cannot allow flashy headlines about the potential 
of AI to distract us from the very real need we know we have to 
support agriculture research broadly. Today's hearing is not 
just about AI and precision agriculture. We also need a 
moonshot in agriculture research. Every dollar invested in 
agricultural research generates $20 in domestic economic 
activity.
    Meanwhile, China has quintupled its investment in public 
agriculture research since 2000, and now it invests twice as 
much as we do. As farmers work to tackle the climate crisis, 
navigate constantly changing markets, and feed a growing global 
population, investments in agriculture research and trustworthy 
economic data will only become more important.
    My goals for the farm bill are to keep farmers farming, 
keep families fed, and keep rural communities strong. Investing 
in research and leveraging technology and artificial 
intelligence will be a critical component to achieving all 
three.
    With that, I will turn to my partner and Ranking Member 
Boozman for his opening comments.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BOOZMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF 
                            ARKANSAS

    Senator Boozman. Thank you, Madam Chair, and we are very 
anxious today to have this hearing to examine the current and 
potential uses of artificial intelligence in our agricultural 
system. We have a panel of experts before us who are able to 
discuss and educate this Committee on the potential of this 
technology within agricultural industry. Thank you all for 
being here. I look forward to learning from you all.
    While agriculture faces many challenges, there are also 
tremendous opportunities on the horizon. I am excited to 
explore some of those opportunities here today.
    AI-powered technology takes many forms across agriculture, 
making it difficult to pinpoint just one definition. Diverse 
uses such as monitoring of livestock for disease protection or 
climate monitoring to mitigate the chance and impacts of 
wildfire are just the starting point.
    Precision agriculture powered by artificial intelligence 
holds promise for American agriculture. From targeted 
fertilizer and pesticide applications guided by dozens of high-
resolution cameras to irrigation systems that can sense the 
source of leaks before crop losses, AI has the potential to 
dramatically increase efficiency, minimize waste, resulting in 
improved yields and profitability.
    AI also has a role to play in our food supply chain. In 
2023, researchers at the University of Arkansas were awarded a 
$5 million U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Institute of 
Food and Agriculture grant to establish the Center for Scalable 
and Intelligent Automation in Poultry Processing. This center 
will study ways to increase use of AI and robotics in poultry 
processing to reduce waste and detect pathogens. This 
technology may be useful in so many different ways for 
processing plant employees to achieve consistency in the 
specifications of products while also mitigating the threats 
posed by pathogens and making our food supply even safer.
    However, while AI holds great potential, we should also ask 
tough questions about the potential risks. New regulations may 
be needed to ensure that consumers are kept safe, especially 
when it comes to the use of applications that handle sensitive 
data.
    For decades, the United States has led the world in 
innovation. One-third of the $5 trillion global information 
technology market in 2022 was located in the U.S. Since the 
beginning of the technological revolution, America exercised a 
light-touch approach toward regulating this budding industry 
while others like Europe took a different approach. We must 
determine if that approach is appropriate when it comes to 
regulating AI and its uses in agriculture.
    Before concluding, I would like to discuss the pending farm 
bill extension. Text was unveiled this weekend outlining the 
agreement among Chairwoman Stabenow, myself, and our colleagues 
leading the House Agriculture Committee. We have agreed to 
provide a one-year extension of the 2018 Farm Bill and to 
maintain funding for the orphan programs.
    I want to thank the Chair very, very much for her 
leadership and partnership to provide certainty to our farmers 
and ranchers, so they can go about running their businesses as 
we continue our work to reauthorize the farm bill.
    It is more important than ever to pass a farm bill that 
reflects the needs and challenges of today and gives certainty 
to those responsible for producing the food and fiber that 
feeds and clothes the world. We owe it to them to get this farm 
bill and get it done right.
    In closing, I am encouraged by the work of my colleagues on 
this Committee to explore risk and regulatory remedies needed 
to protect Americans from potential risks posed by AI while 
also encouraging innovation to thrive.
    Before I end my remarks I wanted to recognize a member of 
Senator Ernst's staff, Steph Carlson, who serves as the deputy 
legislative director and ag advisor to Senator Ernst. Steph is 
returning to her home State of Iowa to be closer to family and 
to work for the National Pork Producers Council, so we will 
still be seeing you around.
    I was fortunate to spend some time with Steph this spring 
during my visit to Iowa. There is no question that Steph is 
committed to helping Iowa's farm families. I appreciate her 
contribution to the work of this Committee and wish her the 
best.
    Thank you again, Madam Chair, and I look forward to today's 
discussion.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well thank you so much, Senator 
Boozman. I want to thank you as well for our work on a full 
extension for up to one year. We want to get the farm bill done 
before that year is up. I am confident we can do that. I very 
much appreciate your leadership as well and am pushing forward 
to make sure we continue the full farm bill programs and to 
know that we have agreement from our House partners. The Four 
Corners agreement gives me optimism that we can move forward 
and get a farm bill done. I really look forward to working with 
you on that.
    We will introduce each of our witnesses now and then turn 
it to you for your comments.
    Our first witness is Dr. Mason Earles. He is an Assistant 
Professor at the University of California, Davis, where he 
leads a research lab and team focused on AI and agriculture. 
Dr. Earles is also a co-lead for the USDA-funded National AI 
Institute for Next-Generation Food Systems. Prior to joining UC 
Davis, he worked at Apple as a data science engineer, and 
recently founded an agriculture technology startup called 
Scout.
    Our next witness is Mr. Sanjeev Krishnan. Mr. Krishnan is 
the Chief Investment Officer and Founding Managing Director at 
S2G Ventures. He has nearly 20 years of experience in sourcing 
and managing venture and capital equity investments, focusing 
on agriculture and food companies. Mr. Krishnan is a graduate 
of the London School of Economics and grew up in Grosse Pointe, 
Michigan, so that is a special reason why I am glad that you 
are here. He enjoys spending time with his family and friends 
in their home city of Chicago, Illinois. Thank you so much for 
being here.
    I am now going to turn to Senator Thune to make the next 
introduction.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Madam Chair, and let me just echo 
what was said earlier by the Ranking Member, Senator Boozman. 
Thank you to you and to him for working and facilitating an 
extension of the farm bill and dealing with the orphan 
programs. I am pleased we are able to get that done, although I 
would say that it is no substitute for a multi-year 
authorization and I hope we keep our heads down and try and get 
that accomplished.
    I do want to welcome Dr. Jose-Marie Griffiths to the panel 
today. She President at Dakota State University. I have had the 
privilege of working with her for several years, and she has 
testified numerous times in front of the Senate Commerce 
Committee where she shared her expertise, and I am grateful 
that she is willing to share that expertise today with the 
Senate Ag Committee.
    Dr. Griffiths has served in Presidential appointments for 
the National Science Board, Commission on Libraries and 
Information Science, and she has recently been appointed to be 
a member of the National Security Commission on Artificial 
Intelligence. Because of Dr. Griffiths' passion about expanding 
research and educational opportunities, Dakota State University 
is a leader in the Nation in developing a high-quality skilled 
technology and cyber work force, and DSU has played a critical 
part in ensuring that our farmers and ranchers are able to take 
part in the technological revolution.
    DSU, in partnership with South Dakota State University, 
launched a joint doctorate program on precision ag and cyber. 
This program brings an important focus to the cybersecurity 
threats the agricultural economy faces, and this is critically 
important as new technologies like artificial intelligence 
become more prevalent in the agriculture sector.
    It is important work. This hearing is important. There is a 
huge intersection between agriculture, which is our State's No. 
1 industry, and technology, all of which can boost yields and 
incomes for agriculture and make us more competitive in the 
global marketplace. Dr. Griffiths, thank you for your great 
work and welcome here today, and we look forward to hearings 
yours. Thank you to all the panelists for being here to share 
your expertise with this panel. Thanks.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you. Senator Boozman will have 
the next introduction.
    Senator Boozman. Yes. I am pleased to welcome Dr. Jahmy 
Hindman, who is Senior Vice President and Chief Technology 
Officer at Deere & Company, a position he has held since July 
2020. He is responsible for building Deere's tech stack, the 
company's intuitive end-to-end software, end-to-end equipment 
solution, made up of hardware and devices, embedded software, 
connectivity, data platforms, and applications. It is so 
complicated I cannot even read it.
    He leads the company's Intelligence Solutions Group, its 
global network of technology, innovation centers, and the

    STATEMENT OF MASON EARLES, Ph.D., ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, 
 VITICULTURE & ENOLOGY, BIOLOGICAL & AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING, 
 CO-PI AND LEAD OF AGRICULTURAL CLUSTER, AI INSTITUTE FOR NEXT-
   GENERATION FOOD SYSTEMS, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS, 
                           DAVIS, CA

    Dr. Earles. Thank you. Good morning, Chairwoman Stabenow, 
Ranking Member Boozman, and members of the Committee. I am 
happy to be here today to discuss the topic of leveraging 
technology and artificial intelligence for innovation in 
American agriculture.
    My name is Mason Earles, and I am an Assistant Professor at 
the University of California, Davis. I am also a CO-PI and 
Agricultural Production Cluster Lead at the USDA-funded 
National AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems, and as 
mentioned earlier, a co-founder of an ag tech startup. Prior to 
joining UC Davis, I worked as a Data Science Engineer at Apple, 
and before this I worked on the basics of how plants work, the 
fundamentals of plant physiology.
    Today, my lab at UC Davis sits at the crossroads of 
agriculture and artificial intelligence, or AI. I lead a team 
of engineers, computer scientists, and biologists who are 
making AI-enabled sensing systems that aim to help agricultural 
producers manage more precisely, efficiently, and sustainably. 
However, I am not here just to talk about what we do in my lab 
but I want to more broadly discuss the rapidly growing trend of 
AI and technology in agriculture and food systems, and the role 
of research institutions in spurring such innovation.
    We are sitting here today because of unprecedented 
advancements in hardware and software which have massively 
expanded the capacity of AI computer programs to learn from 
complex real-world data like what we see in agriculture and 
food systems.
    Before going any further, however, I would like to define 
``AI'' using a relevant example. Put simply, an AI is a 
computer program that takes in one or more inputs, like an 
image, audio recording, or table of data, and outputs some 
prediction or physical action. Okay, so what do I mean by that?
    As an example, let's say we input into our computer program 
thousands of images taken from a camera mounted on a tractor 
weeding implement in a carrot field and we want the AI to 
predict if an invasive weed, such as nightshade, is present in 
the image, which could, in response, trigger a precise 
herbicide spray application, for instance. We typically train 
these AI computer programs by showing them many examples of 
inputs with ``correct'' outputs. In our carrot versus 
nightshade example, this means that a human first categorizes 
which images do or do not have nightshade, literally clicking 
``yes'' or ``no'' on a screen. The AI computer program then 
repeatedly tries to predict which images contain nightshade 
versus carrots and is penalized for incorrect predictions. Once 
training reaches a desired performance target, this AI can then 
be used to automate the detection, and potentially spraying, of 
nightshade based on input images without the need for human 
categorization. This is just one of many, many possible 
examples of the growing number of current and potential 
applications of AI in agriculture and food systems.
    At the AI Institute for Next-Generation Food Systems, our 
team of more than 40 researchers across six national 
institutions aims to accelerate critical solutions to big 
challenges in the food supply chain, from crop breeding and 
farming to food processing and nutrition. Imagine if AI could 
bring together genomic and sensor data to uncover novel 
molecular patterns to enable plant breeders to discover more 
flavorful and nutritious strawberries.
    Now, imagine those same strawberries growing in a field 
where hundreds of cheap, paperclip-sized soil sensors are 
measuring nutrient and water stress, and wirelessly sending 
data to a drone that flies overhead each day. After harvest, 
these strawberries are transported to a processing facility 
that rapidly samples washwater to rule out the presence of E. 
Coli pathogens using AI-enabled microscopy. Finally, a consumer 
points their phone at their plate which uses AI to estimate the 
macro and micronutrients of the strawberries and every other 
ingredient they are about eat.
    Critically, the socioeconomic and ethical risks of 
introducing AI tools across the food supply chain, such as data 
privacy and security, and potential effects on labor must be 
considered. Our researchers and industry partners at the AI 
Institute for Next-Generation Food Systems are investigating 
each of these topics, among many others. We see ourselves as 
one of the world's leaders in research, development, and 
commercialization of such novel, importantly open-sourced, AI-
based solutions in food and agriculture. We do this through a 
three-pronged strategy of multidisciplinary science, industry 
engagement, and work force development.
    Such a massive effort and innovation is made possible by 
more than $20 million in funding provided over five years by 
USDA's NIFA as part of NSF's National AI Institutes. In fact, 
four additional National AI Institutes focused on food and 
agriculture are funded by USDA NIFA, totaling more than 30 
research institutions and industry partners across America. 
These National AI Institutes are working on programs that aim 
to relieve labor shortages via AI-driven robotic harvesters in 
tree crops, monitor the health and stress of livestock using 
AI-enabled sensors, and predict climate and crop risk by 
building AI-accelerated models that could eventually be used to 
precisely control irrigation and nutrient emitters. Each of 
these AI Institutes is focused on tech transfer and meeting 
industry needs, with partners including dairy producers, 
soybean farmers, chemical and agricultural machinery producers, 
among others.
    Thinking to the future of our work force, in 2021 more than 
161,000 undergraduate and graduate computer science degrees 
were awarded in the U.S. alone. While we do not have exact 
numbers, a very small fraction of these students end up working 
in the agricultural and food sector. This needs to change.
    Building on these accomplishments and to keep America as a 
global leader in agricultural innovation, I strongly encourage 
the Committee to continue, and even expand, funding for these 
National AI Institutes among other funding sources provide 
through the USDA that focuses on AI solutions for food and 
agriculture. I believe that this is how we will accelerate more 
research innovation and industry collaboration, and create a 
wider funnel for motivating more computer science and 
engineering students to solve the big challenges in the 
agricultural sector via AI and new technology. Thank you.

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much.
    Next we will hear from Mr. Krishnan. Thank you, Mr. 
Krishnan, for coming and sharing your thoughts.

  STATEMENT OF SANJEEV KRISHNAN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AND 
      SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, S2G VENTURES, CHICAGO, IL

    Mr. Krishnan. Chairwoman Stabenow, Ranking Member Boozman, 
and members of the Senate Agriculture Committee, thank you for 
the opportunity to speak to you today. My name is Sanjeev 
Krishnan. I am a founding team member and Chief Investment 
Officer of S2G Ventures.
    S2G was founded in 2014, and is now one of the largest 
investment firms focused on sustainable food and agriculture 
solutions and technologies. Today we manage $2 billion of 
capital, and our portfolio includes investments in more than 90 
companies. We are based in the Midwest and deploy capital that 
creates jobs and returns in the heartland.
    At S2G I help lead a team of more than 40 sector experts 
and investors focused on identifying and making investments in 
technologies and entrepreneurs. Nearly all 90 portfolio 
companies are either headquartered or maintain operations in 
the United States. Across our portfolio we have companies that 
either operate, manufacture, or distribute in every State 
represented by members of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
    We do not just write checks. We ask what problems need to 
be solved and seek to understand how individuals experience 
them. What does the consumer in Iowa see in terms of price and 
quality? What is the farmer in Michigan or a rancher in 
Colorado experiencing? How are communities in Mississippi 
impacted? We explore those leverage points and make targeted 
investments across the ecosystem. In practice, this might look 
like identifying a durable consumer trend. We might consider 
investing in new consumer products to meet this trend. Or 
companies using machine learning to develop more flavorful and 
nutrient-dense ingredients through improved seed genetics; what 
farmers might need to plant this hypothetical crop; the 
infrastructure needed to take crops from farm field to finished 
goods; less intense ways to nourish those crops; tools that 
enable farmers to measure and profit from those environmental 
benefits, and fintech solutions that de-risk the transition to 
a new crop.
    My comments today will draw from this system's perspective, 
focusing on four themes.
    One, the journey of the American farmer is a remarkable 
story of embracing innovation and transformation. Technology 
and artificial intelligence build on this tradition. These 
technologies and their applications and implications are just 
beginning to emerge, but they offer a unique toolkit to rapidly 
accelerate breakthrough solutions and significant per-acre 
value generation.
    Today, farmers are drowning in data and not in solutions. 
We now have aggregated data points from sensors, machinery, and 
many other sources. Improving that data's quality and utilizing 
the data will drive better, faster, and more efficient and 
precise ag tech solutions. These solutions will be able to 
automatically adapt and moderate the impacts of extreme 
weather, volatile commodity prices, and more. This also 
represents a new frontier of deriving value from on-farm data.
    Third, AI can help enhance the foundation of U.S. 
agriculture: trust and community. This sounds counterintuitive, 
but ag technology, data analytics, and AI have an important 
role to play in strengthening human relationships. For example, 
AI offers nearly instant power to analyze and identify patterns 
across massive amounts of historical research and on-farm data. 
Combined with the real-world experience, AI can enable 
independent agronomists or certified crop advisors to offer 
faster, more precise advice and actual insights to farmers. AI 
can help make existing ag technologies better and more 
effective and help weed out ineffective approaches. This 
enables farmers to focus their resources and time on options 
that work best with the conditions on their operations.
    Fourth, public policy plays a critical role in developing 
and scaling critical ag tech solutions. Federal loan guarantees 
and other financing opportunities offer security to the 
developers of nascent technology that, once they are at scale, 
offer a public good in the form of improved sustainability or 
profitability. Financial instruments will continue to be an 
important area for public-private partnership and innovation. 
Improving data quality and sharing will be critical. The public 
and private sector should work together to avoid duplicative 
work and focus limited resources on filling data gaps, and it 
will be critical to protect privacy, support the farmer, and 
build tools that account for the full diversity of the food and 
agriculture system.
    Thank you again to the Committee for your leadership in 
convening today's hearing. I look forward to responding to your 
questions.

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much.
    Now we will hear from Dr. Griffiths. Welcome.

  STATEMENT OF JOSE-MARIE GRIFFITHS, Ph.D., PRESIDENT, DAKOTA 
                 STATE UNIVERSITY, MADISON, SD

    Dr. Griffiths. Good morning, Chairwoman Stabenow and 
Ranking Member Boozman and members of the Committee. Thank you 
for this opportunity to testify today. I am Jose-Marie 
Griffiths, President of Dakota State University, located in 
Madison, South Dakota.
    At our institution we are focused on training the next 
generation of professionals in emerging technology fields such 
as AI, cybersecurity, and quantum computing. Dakota State 
University is one of only ten universities nationwide to hold 
all three Center of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity 
designations from the National Security Agency and Department 
of Homeland Security, and we have innovative R&D campus 
facilities and public-private partnership models that empower 
students to immediately enter the cyber work force upon 
graduation. One example is the Dakota State University Applied 
Research Corporation, which operates and manages the Dakota 
State University Applied Research Lab.
    Additionally, we are partnering with South Dakota State 
University, the State's leading agricultural institution, on 
collaborative research through a precision CyberAg partnership, 
where South Dakota State University brings the data generated 
by precision technologies and we leverage our cyber and AI 
expertise.
    Agriculture has evolved tremendously over the past 100 
years. Innovative technology is now being leveraged to drive 
farming equipment, predict crop health, optimize yields, and 
monitor the entire produce supply chain from seeds to stomach.
    The integration of technology and AI stands to shape the 
future of agriculture with both tremendous benefits and risks. 
Amidst the modern cyber threat landscape, further research is 
needed to ensure AI can reach its full potential.
    As the Committee considers how to deploy AI across 
agriculture, Dakota State University offers the following 
recommendations.
    First, support the increased adoption of AI and its 
transformative potential in the U.S. agriculture sector. When 
embedded in connected systems, AI technologies enable the 
widespread collection of vast amounts of data from crops and 
livestock through satellites, drones, sensors, and robots. 
Analysis of these data can lower costs and improve yields and 
production
    Second, support stronger cybersecurity protections to 
safeguard the critical infrastructure of the U.S. agriculture 
industry. Embedding AI into internet-connected farming 
machinery vehicles and devices does inherently make systems 
more vulnerable to cyberattacks, but there are solutions to 
protect this critical infrastructure powering our national food 
supply.
    Third, support the expansion of agricultural research 
focused on AI to help increase the sustainability of the 
agriculture industry. This research can led to the creation of 
new technologies and improved policies that will enhance 
agricultural productivity and resilience.
    Fourth, intellectual property confidentiality risk is 
another key consideration. As AI applications are rapidly 
developed and deployed, IP confidentiality is essential to 
protect and prioritize the development of leading innovations 
in the field.
    Finally, the fifth recommendation is for a heightened 
concern for cyber and national security that involves the 
acquisition of land by unfriendly nations, especially in 
sensitive areas or close proximity to critical infrastructure 
and agricultural areas. It is crucial to secure our land for 
the sake of national security.
    The United States has a critical opportunity to advance the 
use of AI to further innovation the agriculture sector while 
also helping address very real cyber risks and challenges 
associated with a growing attack surface. There are crucial 
steps that academia, in partnership with industry and Federal 
agencies, can take to ensure the safe, responsible, and 
effective use of AI.
    The agriculture industry has been automating and innovating 
for decades. While the deployment of AI across agriculture is a 
transformative shift, it is nothing we cannot be prepared for. 
I would like to recognize our leaders in South Dakota, 
including Senator Thune, Senator Rounds, Representative 
Johnson, and Governor Noem for their continued leadership in 
this area.
    Dakota State University looks forward to continued 
collaboration with the Committee to develop policies to advance 
the safe, responsible, and effective deployment of AI across 
agriculture.
    Thank you for your time.

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much.
    Dr. Hindman, welcome.

 STATEMENT OF JAHMY HINDMAN, Ph.D., SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND 
     CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER, DEERE & COMPANY, MOLINE, IL

    Dr. Hindman. Good morning. On behalf of Deere's 80,000 
employees worldwide, I want to thank the Committee for the 
opportunity to address you here today.
    John Deere is dedicated to assisting customers in meeting 
the increasing global demand for food, fuel, shelter, and 
clothing. We tackle challenges like limited land, water, and 
rural labor by leveraging technology, including artificial 
intelligence, to empower growers to achieve higher productivity 
with fewer resources. This approach allows farmers to 
accomplish more with less while improving both their economic 
and environmental sustainability.
    Deere currently connects over 650,000 machines around the 
world using terrestrial cellular networks. This allows data 
generated during farming tasks like planting and harvesting to 
be sent to the cloud for analysis. The insights gained from 
this analysis help optimize a farmer's current tasks, such as 
improving logistics, and contribute to enhancing future farming 
seasons.
    A common concern regarding farmers' data is ownership, and 
we are unequivocal on this matter: John Deere customers retain 
control over their data, including how it is collected, stored, 
processed, and shared. That said, we also believe that the 
valuable insights that can be derived from this information 
will play a crucial role in meeting our industry's collective 
objective of sustaining a growing global population.
    Farmers use these same connections to deliver data-driven 
instructions back to their machines, such as prescriptions for 
applying different rates of fertilizer to different parts of a 
field, navigation information used to auto-steer machines, and 
input specifications like seed and fertilizer. These network 
services are offered to farmers through partnerships with 
third-party companies, allowing farmers to have greater 
flexibility in choosing the services based on their own 
preferences and needs. However, it is vitally important to 
address connectivity challenges in rural areas, including in-
field connectivity, to fully unlock the benefits of technology 
for farmers.
    In addition to connecting our products, we have 
significantly increased the computing capability embedded 
within those products. This allows for more advanced control 
and enables a unique ``plant-level management'' capability, 
where each plant can be nurtured to achieve its optimal 
potential. Our self-propelled sprayers, for example, feature 
nine graphical processing units and 36 cameras. These cameras 
can scan a distance of 120 feet at a speed of 12 miles per 
hour. Through artificial intelligence, they analyze images to 
identify weed pixels, allowing precise herbicide application 
only where necessary. This See & Spray TM technology is not 
some futuristic vision. It is already in the field. In 2023, 
U.S. farmers achieved an impressive 61 percent reduction in 
contact herbicide usage across 275,000 acres of corn, soy, and 
cotton, saving approximately two million gallons of herbicide.
    Reducing herbicide use is just the start of AI's potential 
in agriculture. For instance, we have integrated the same 
graphical processing units with stereo cameras in our 
autonomous tillage solution. This application of artificial 
intelligence allows us to identify obstacles in the fields, 
prompting the fully autonomous tractor and tillage tool to 
pause and await further instructions from the farmer, who may 
be engaged in other, higher-value tasks. This solution directly 
addresses labor scarcity, especially during critical 
agricultural periods such as harvest and planting. In the past 
two growing seasons, this AI technology facilitated autonomous 
operations on approximately 45,000 acres of corn and soy in 
North America. As rural-to-urban migration continues, AI-
powered solutions like this one become even more essential to 
U.S. farm productivity.
    Additionally, we leverage the power of AI to train models 
using our technical assistance data. This enables us to 
promptly address customer or dealer machine issues, ensuring 
swift problem resolution. AI allows us to efficiently identify 
similar issues across a machine population and expedite 
solutions for affected customers. As a result, the impact 
duration during crucial agronomic timing windows is 
significantly reduced.
    The future of U.S. agriculture is being built today with 
tools that enable data-driven decisionmaking by farmers. 
Artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in unlocking the 
value of that data and turning it into actionable insights in 
the field. We need your help.
    U.S. farmers would benefit greatly from incentives to help 
them acquire the precision technology needed to do their jobs 
more effectively and sustainably. As you deliberate the 
upcoming farm bill, I urge you to consider such proposals as 
the PRECISE Act, and the Precision Ag Loan Act, that would 
expand eligibility for USDA conservation and loan programs to 
include the adoption of precision technologies. Further, bills 
like the Last Acre Act are essential for farmers to fully 
leverage the benefits of AI and precision technologies.
    Putting these technologies in the hands of America's 
farmers not only improves productivity and profitability for 
growers, but also enables them to produce enough food, fuel, 
shelter, and clothing to sustain the growing world population. 
That benefits us all.
    Thank you.

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much.
    Now we ask Mr. Janzen. Welcome.

   STATEMENT OF TODD J. JANZEN, PRESIDENT, JANZEN SCHROEDER 
   AGRICULTURAL LAW LLC; ADMINISTRATOR, AG DATA TRANSPARENT 
                 ORGANIZATION, INDIANAPOLIS, IN

    Mr. Janzen. Thank you, Chairwoman Stabenow, Ranking Member 
Boozman, and members of the Committee. My name is Todd Janzen. 
I am an attorney at the law firm of Janzen Schroeder 
Agricultural Law LLC, based in Indianapolis, Indiana, and we 
serve the needs of America's farmers, agribusinesses, and also 
ag tech providers. I am also here today because I grew up on a 
farm in south-central Kansas and so I have agriculture at my 
roots.
    I would like to make three points here today about 
agricultural technology, the digitalization of farming, and 
artificial intelligence.
    First, there are many ways that farmers are already 
interfacing with digital technologies today. We have everything 
from farm management information systems, which provide a suite 
of services to farmers in exchange for collection of data and 
allow farmers to analyze their decisions and make informed 
decision based upon all that data.
    On the other end of the spectrum we have remote sensors and 
items that are very specific about performing one task, but 
these are also connected to the internet and often referred to 
as Internet-of-Things devices. They allow farmers to remotely 
monitor what is going on on the farm.
    Then, of course, there is everything in between, from 
aerial imagery, satellite imagery, connected machines, and even 
connected livestock on the farm.
    All of these tools share one common denominator, which is 
that they all collect a lot of data from farmers, and farmers 
are a sensitive group when it comes to talking about sharing 
their data, and they have a good reason to be so.
    Second I want to talk about what are some of the reasons 
that farmers are reluctant to share data with companies that 
want to offer these digital tools. When farmers are polled, it 
is almost always the same three things bubble to the surface, 
and I would say the first is a lack of trust in a lot of these 
platforms. Farmers just do not know what happens after the data 
moves to these cloud-based platforms.
    Second, privacy concerns. Obviously, this is proprietary 
data for a lot of farmers, and so it is their livelihood, so 
they want to know that it is protected.
    Third, from my standpoint, what I also see is a lot of 
overly complex technical agreements that make it difficult for 
farmers to understand exactly what it is they are giving up as 
far as the data.
    Much of my work has been done to try and alleviate these 
concerns in the technology space as a number of companies want 
to move into the agricultural area. I have done this through a 
project called the Ag Data Transparent Organization. What Ag 
Data Transparent does is certify companies that work to show 
that they are transparent with how they are collecting and 
using and storing farmers' data. To date, this Ag Data 
Transparent Organization has certified over 40 companies, and 
there are still many more that need to be certified, and there 
is much work to do.
    I would like to also talk just a couple of minutes about 
artificial intelligence and how that is arriving on the farm. I 
like to think of it in different buckets. On one end we have 
narrow AI, or narrow artificial intelligence, which takes a 
number of datapoints to make a single, informed decision about 
something, like is this a weed or is this a valuable crop.
    On the other end of the spectrum we have the general AI, 
which takes a lot of data from different sources and is focused 
on trying to mimic human behavior. An example might be 
analyzing a whole catalog of different seeds that are available 
and then applying those to a specific farmer's fields for a 
specific area, based upon the weather predictions for that 
year, to suggest this is the ideal crop to plant for you.
    With all of these, though, of course, there is more data 
collection, and so that remains a concern for protection. 
Farmers should know how their data is going to be used. They 
should know, when they sign up for AI platforms, if it is going 
to be used to train these platforms and what that means for 
them.
    Finally, I would like to offer just three policy 
considerations based upon my work as an attorney in this 
sector. First, I think that any policy should focus on leveling 
the playing field and not stifling innovation because this is 
such an innovative sector. Second, when I think trust is 
lacking, then transparency becomes even more important. If 
anyone is collecting data and they do not have that farmer 
trust, they have to be extremely transparent with how they are 
using it.
    Finally, any platform that uses agricultural data should 
try to return an equal or greater value of that data back to 
the farmer in the resulting product. I would say to you that 
all three of these recommendations are true whether it is 
private industry collecting data or whether or not it is the 
government collecting data for use in some farm program.
    Thank you very much. I look forward to the questions today.

    [The prepared statement of Mr. Janzen can be found on page 
69 in the appendix.]

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well, thank you to all of you for your 
thoughtful testimony and raising what I think are really 
important issues. Let me start with Dr. Earles.
    The world was a very different place five years ago when we 
wrote the last farm bill, and from your position now, through 
your leadership, when you see firsthand how quickly everything 
is changing, how is our understanding of artificial 
intelligence in the agriculture sector different than five 
years ago? Where are we going, specifically? Could you talk 
more specifically about what we need to be paying attention to 
and doing.
    Dr. Earles. Sure, yes. That is a great question. When I 
think of what has changed in the last five years, I think the 
biggest change has been for actually software developers. What 
I mean by that is, this has upstream consequences for everybody 
that is going to consume the products from AI. What that means 
is it is a lot faster to go from nothing to product today than 
it was five years ago.
    For example, today it may only take a day to build an AI 
model that counts destructive versus beneficial moths on a 
piece of paper from images, whereas five years ago a smaller 
group of people, of skilled individuals, software developers, 
it would have taken them much longer to do this. What that ends 
up meaning is that we get more products to market faster for 
agricultural AI startups and industry.
    What has not changed, though, I think, is that AI models 
still require data, and they require human supervision. What I 
mean by that, as I mentioned earlier, someone has to go in and 
punch in a computer what they see, and that person is an 
expert, an agricultural expert, and those are still in high 
demand but low supply. Being able to connect those agricultural 
experts to the software development process is something that 
is changing quickly but still needs to change faster.
    In the next five years, I think you had asked what I see 
going into the next five years as well, I think even in the 
last week or two weeks we have seen a huge change in how AI and 
humans communicate.
    I am going to give a quick example of this, and what I did 
last night. I sat down and I took my phone out, opened up an 
app-and you mentioned you generated your comments through AI-I 
asked it, I said, ``I am soybean farmer outside of Des Moines, 
Iowa. I have some small worm that is infesting my crop. I am 
near a river. What do you think it is?'' It came back with five 
different possible responses within 30 seconds, and it said, 
``I might be able to help you figure this out if you show me an 
image.''
    First I did this with my voice. I said this to the AI, and 
it responded with its voice and text. It then gave me an option 
to show it an image. This was just like talking to a person, 
right? I show it an image of what I know to be this certain 
type of worm, and it correctly identifies this type of worm.
    To me this is how we communicate with AI that is changing 
rapidly, and they have the soon-to-be role, if not already role 
of being AI advisors.
    I think this is something we need to think a lot about is 
what are the recommendations that they are making and how are 
we training those models such that they are giving reliable, 
robust recommendations, and how are we regulating what is 
coming out of the models, which may end up being easier than 
thinking of how farm advisors are actually doing, but we also 
need to take that into consideration.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Krishnan, when we look at these innovations, of course 
none of them matter if they are just in the lab. They have to 
be out in the hands of farmers. To do that we will need a 
partnership between researchers and the private sector with a 
willing and able work force also.
    Could you speak to what you hear from others in the private 
sector about their reluctance to invest in agricultural 
technology and how can we use these advances to bring new high-
paying jobs to our States?
    Mr. Krishnan. Thank you. Given the need to feed a 
population of 10 billion globally and America's leadership, 
there is increasing interest in the venture capital community 
in this space. Ten years ago it was less than $1 billion, and 
at its peak we hit $12 billion. Year-to-date venture capital 
has invested close to $6 billion in this sector.
    I will say, though, a lot of venture capital investors 
recognize this takes longer. This is more tough tech than 
traditional tech, so the sales cycle and product cycle takes 
longer. There is more risk aversion across the field. That is 
why you have seen less than three percent of venture capital 
dedicated to ag tech. We think we need to improve that, and 
there is a huge amount of opportunity for the public sector and 
private sector to be in partnership to accelerate this adoption 
cycle and get more venture capital into the sector.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Boozman.
    Senator Boozman. Thank you, Madam Chair. We do appreciate 
you all being here. It is interesting the Ag Committee really 
is, for almost everything that we deal with, is very 
bipartisan, and the minority selects witnesses, the majority 
selects witnesses, but all of you all, again, could be 
witnesses for any of us. Like I say, you are just trying to 
figure out answers, trying to come up with solutions, in this 
very interesting field that has the promise of really making a 
huge difference to humanity in so many different ways. Thank 
you all for what you are doing and what you are working on.
    Dr. Hindman, in your testimony you State ``John Deere 
customers retain control over their data, including how it is 
collected, stored, processed, and shared.'' Can you talk a 
little more about how this works in practice, including the 
process for producers who may wish to make changes in the way 
their data is being handled?
    Dr. Hindman. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. Today, in 
our digital application, John Deere Operations Center, that is 
where customers can control, modify, change the information 
that they have that is reflecting their particular farm 
operation. They get the opportunity to invite people within 
their organization to participate in that application and 
define the access rights for those people. That might be other 
labor on the farm. It might be an agronomist that they are 
working with. It might be a third company that potentially is 
working with them on different aspects of their operation. They 
get to determine what that information is, where it goes, and 
what it is used for.
    They can change that dynamically. They can change it on 
their mobile phone if they want. They can change it in the 
desktop application. They can do that at any point in time.
    They also have the ability, if they so choose, to delete 
that information if they want to remove the record. Generally 
that is a pretty unlikely thing in our experience, but they 
have the capability and the opportunity to do that if they 
choose.
    Senator Boozman. Very good. Dr. Griffiths, what are the 
cybersecurity risks associated with integrating more 
technologies like AI into the agricultural sector? Why is it 
important to research and explore the transformative potential 
of AI in this area?
    Dr. Griffiths. Thank you for the question. Well, the risks 
are the same kinds of risks that you get with any AI 
application. Artificial intelligence, first of all, it is 
basically a set of algorithms or computer programs, and it is 
data, whether it is test data or live data, and you have the 
opportunity to attack either. Hackers will and can attack 
either, for whatever reasons they wish to do it.
    In the agricultural sector we really need to start 
protecting the data, and that is part of the kinds of research 
that we are engaged in with industry and with South Dakota 
State University. For example, we have been looking at how data 
go from satellite to the cloud-we also have data in the cloud 
these days-and how can we ensure data confidentiality and 
integrity as the data move from one place to another, because 
it is easy to attack those data.
    We look at developing an effective method both for 
encrypting the data and then doing that at a speed and cost 
without involving any delay in the processing of the data, 
which, as you just heard, sort of operates in sort of 
milliseconds in time. It is very, very important for the data 
to get to the person who is making ultimate decisions from the 
AI.
    I think as AI evolves we are seeing more and more 
technology being incorporated into the agricultural sector, and 
that increases what we call the threat landscape. There are 
more and more points at which you can begin to attack the 
system. You are only as strong as the weakest link, as it were.
    I will give you another example. Just before Russia invaded 
Ukraine, we saw pictures of tractors stuck in fields, unable to 
move because the systems had been attacked, and that created an 
impetus for us to do some work on trying to protect farm 
vehicles from similar kinds of attacks that could occur from 
unfriendly States.
    We have looked at enhancing the security of these farming 
vehicles, developing artificial intelligence-enhanced, we call 
intrusion detection systems, people who are trying to get into 
the system to do damage. These systems are designed to 
strengthen the cybersecurity of agricultural machine. We are 
looking at this not just for today's technology but we are 
looking five years out at the technology that will be in the 
fields, to try and ensure that they are robust and cyber 
protected from the beginning.
    I think it is important to remember that this entire supply 
chain, this entire food and security and clothing supply chain, 
it needs to be addressed at every single point and scale. I 
often say we talk a lot about protecting the data from sensors 
and from tractors and other vehicles, but we also have to 
protect the seeds and the treatment of seeds and how the 
fungicides and herbicides are being measured to be put on seeds 
for seed production, because we actually could see a 
significant latent effect on the actual development or non-
development of crops going on in the future.
    I hate to be the negative person here. I am very excited 
about what artificial intelligence can do in the agricultural 
sector. I feel like the child in the Sixth Sense. You know, I 
see cyber threats everywhere. When I see a vulnerability I 
think we have to find a way to attack it. I just ask that you 
be fully aware that you cannot separate any new technology 
these days from cybersecurity. The two have to go together. As 
technology evolves and as artificial intelligence evolves-it is 
multiple things; it is not a single thing-we have to evolve the 
cybersecurity that goes with it.
    Senator Boozman. Thank you very much. Thank you, Madam 
Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator 
Klobuchar.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much to both of you. I am 
excited about the work that is going on.
    This summer I toured a number of farms in Minnesota that 
were making impressive use of precision agriculture. On one of 
the farms the sprayer had been configured to only spray on 
plants that it correctly identified as weeds. I know you are 
seeing this all over in our agriculture communities. We know it 
helps reduce input costs, better for conservation. That is why 
Senator Fischer and I introduced the Precision Agriculture Loan 
Act, and I know, Dr. Hindman, you mentioned the Precision Ag 
bill in your testimony, which I appreciate.
    I guess I would start with you, Mr. Krishnan. In your 
testimony you discussed the important role that Federal 
financing opportunities can have in helping scale these kinds 
of technologies. Could you talk a little more about that?
    Mr. Krishnan. I think as agriculture goes from data poor to 
data rich everyone is talking about precision agriculture, so 
drones, satellites, remote sensing, et cetera. We also see a 
more data-driven food and ag system supporting new risk 
management lending solutions, particularly not only to adopt 
and de-risk scaling of new technologies but also for longer 
term decisionmaking, focused on soil health and sustainability. 
I think this is a really important area for public policy to 
get involved in, to give farmers not just the tools but the 
financing to increase yield per acre and profit per acre.
    Senator Klobuchar. Exactly. Senator Thune and I lead a 
different bill that would require the USDA to identify and 
collect and analyze the data. What you are saying is that it is 
helpful to have both the data as well as the financing.
    Mr. Krishnan. I think both are really important and 
critical.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Dr. Earles, in your testimony you 
talked about the work you are leading at UC Davis to develop 
AI-enabled sensing systems that help producers manage their 
operations more precisely. Can you talk about how that can help 
with costs in the long term. It is an investment in the short 
term, please. Thank you.
    Dr. Earles. Absolutely. In terms of on the farm, you know, 
we think of the breakdowns in terms of cost. I think more of 
specialty crops because I am coming from California, but I 
think this applies across many different types of crops. Where 
we have all of these inputs that farmers are facing, they are 
spread across a number of different activities.
    AI has the potential to hit various activities, whether it 
be fertilization, pest management, yield forecasting and 
prediction, and other types of irrigation and so on. I think 
these are cost-saving measures that may be somewhere between 5 
to 15 percent, on average, in any given farmer's operations. 
One of the challenges in going from an idea to a product in 
agricultural for cost savings is finding those real value 
propositions, I think, in precision agriculture.
    What we have been working on is really identifying what 
those are. That really depends on what crop type we are looking 
at, and I think this is a big challenge for AI going forward, 
is finding each one of those crop types' pivot points that they 
are willing to bring AI into adoption.
    Senator Klobuchar. You cannot really do most of this 
without broadband, and as we know, that is a big piece of this, 
to get broadband to every corner of our country. We made sure 
that the Bipartisan Infrastructure law that many of us at this 
table supported included a significant investment in broadband 
infrastructure. I actually led that bill before it got included 
in the Bipartisan Infrastructure law.
    Dr. Griffiths, can you talk about the importance of 
broadband to making AI-enabled ag technologies work for 
farmers, and how can we do more to solve the work force 
shortage, which is another issue that is plaguing us in rural.
    Dr. Griffiths. Absolutely. Thank you for that. Yes. I will 
start with the broadband question. Given the fact that we are 
able to potentially generate huge amounts of data, we have to 
send the data somewhere, and we have to do it in a timely 
manner, and in order to do that we need the broadband 
infrastructure to become ubiquitous across the entire country, 
but especially in the farmlands and in the middle of the United 
States, where it is not necessarily uniformly available at this 
time. That has been something, actually, that I have testified 
on before, and here it is again. We cannot ignore that as 
enabling infrastructure for the use of many of these additional 
and new and emerging technologies.
    Even in South Dakota, we are doing pretty well on broadband 
infrastructure on one side of the State and the other side not 
so good. Then we have Badlands and topologies where it is very, 
very difficult to try and ensure that equal access to broadband 
technologies. We are working on it, and will continue to do so.
    The work force issue is another issue that is plaguing us, 
because we really do not have sufficient numbers of people who 
are fully aware of the capabilities of our artificial 
intelligence. I classify the work force needs into three areas. 
We have the need for additional experts who are actually going 
to help develop these AI-related applications to agriculture 
and to other sectors, and we are in relatively short supply of 
those people. We need to encourage more people to go into STEM, 
and I think that particular issue will not be solved with 
domestic personnel alone. We are going to have to look at legal 
immigration.
    The second area, though, we are going to have more people 
engaged in what we call the users. There are two kinds of users 
of AI technologies. They are the producers of products and 
services who are using AI technologies to create their 
offerings, and then we also have the end users of those 
products and service, so you could say the individual farmers 
or ranchers who actually need to use those products and 
service. Then we ultimately have the general public. What 
should the general public know about artificial intelligence?
    I think the key here is, one, we do need more people moving 
into these fields, and second, we need to do more to educate 
the users and end users of the capabilities and the risks 
associated with these technologies so that we can develop 
artificial applications, artificial intelligence applications 
responsibly that actually do what we want them to do, that 
carry the kinds of values the United States wishes to spread 
and continue to spread around the world, and minimize the risk 
that is associated with these technologies so that we can 
optimize the use.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Ernst.
    Senator Ernst. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and thanks 
to our witnesses for being here today as well, and thank you, 
Senator Boozman, for mentioning Steph Carlson. We will miss 
Stephanie as she returns back to Iowa to be closer to her Iowa 
family, friends, and, of course, her great Iowa Army National 
Guard unit as well. We really appreciate Steph and the great 
contributions that she has made to the Committee and to my 
office, so thanks, Steph.
    When we passed the farm bill of 2018, we thought it was a 
very significant accomplishment, but here we are today, five 
years later, and we still have no farm bill. It actually 
expired on September 30th. I am encouraged to see that we do 
have a one-year extension agreed to, contingent on the 
continuing resolution being passed. The lack of urgency and 
progress on this once-every-5-year piece of legislation has 
been a real disservice to rural America, and I hope that we can 
see more farm in the farm bill as we move forward and that we 
can get it done early this next year. We really need to work 
hard for our farmers and ranchers.
    I always make this point. Many of you have heard it before. 
I believe that food security is national security, so we need 
to continue on and make sure that we get this over the finish 
line.
    The topic on hand today, it really does have so much 
potential for the future of ag. Whether it is identifying that 
specific type of insect, just as was pointed out--thank you for 
that example--or whether it is monitoring animal behavior in a 
hog barn, AI has the ability to provide our farmers with new 
tools to help them navigate through very difficult decisions.
    I am very proud to say that Iowa has been leading when it 
comes to AI, and my alma mater, Iowa State University, is home 
to the AI Institute for Resilient Agriculture. By partnering 
with Iowa farmers and companies like John Deere--and thank you 
very much, Dr. Hindman, for being here today--I am excited to 
see the future of agriculture. Together they are focused on 
technology that makes smarter, more profitable, and more 
sustainable, to better meet the demands of our future 
generations. Thank you for engaging.
    Dr. Hindman, I will start with you. As you mentioned in 
your testimony, the utilization of AI in ag requires a 
significant amount of user data, which our Iowa farmers are 
collecting when they plant, spray, fertilize, or harvest their 
crops. My brother-in-law uses this technology as well. It is 
pretty exciting to hear him talk about the opportunities there.
    How do you ensure that the information and the privacy--
which is something even my father, he has a good dose of Iowa 
farmer skepticism--how do you ensure that all of that privacy 
is protected for those farmers when they are utilizing your 
particular technology?
    Dr. Hindman. Thank you, Senator. It is a great question. I 
think first I will go back to they control who accesses their 
data within their account, within the Operation Center.
    Before we even get to that stage, we take this very 
seriously within Deere, and we start with a principle of 
security by design, so making sure that as we are developing 
software we are doing it with a seriousness about the security 
aspects of that software, first and foremost, making sure that 
it is secure by design. That is sort of the bedrock of how we 
do software development, whether it is digital or embedded. 
Even with that we still, no doubt, create opportunities for 
threat actors, given the complicated threat surfaces that are 
involved to infiltrate that data.
    We then look toward external partners to help us do things 
like penetration testing, testing the systems to make sure that 
they are resilient to external people trying to get into those 
systems. We partner with white hat hackers. HackerOne would be 
an example where we do a bug bounty program. We pay for ethical 
hackers to try to hack into our systems and expose 
vulnerabilities before they become public so that we can remedy 
those and keep that data intact.
    Senator Ernst. No, that is really good to know, and that 
will help some of these older generations of farmers understand 
the new technology is safe to use and their data is safe.
    Once you have captured all of that data, then how is John 
Deere--do you turn around and use that data to help our 
farmers?
    Dr. Hindman. Yes, it is used in a variety of ways for 
growers, ways for us to look at how to improve the next 
product. You know, is the current product performing to the 
expectations of the customer or not? If not, what can we do to 
move the needle to make it perform better?
    We also utilize it for things like predicting when failures 
might occur in the equipment so that we can provide proactive 
service parts, proactive support for those failures. Especially 
in those critical timing windows of planting and harvesting, 
when every minute matters machine downtime is a problem, and so 
we work to make sure that we can try to position both customers 
and dealers in the best position possible to be able to address 
those disruptions.
    Senator Ernst. That is really great. The military has 
actually been using predictive maintenance and models for a 
very long time, which does save the Federal Government a lot of 
money, and in this case, utilizing this technology on our farms 
may save our farmers a significant amount of money and downtime 
as well.
    Thank you very much. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Absolutely. Senator Welch.
    Senator Welch. Thank you very much. I do want to thank 
Senator Stabenow and Senator Boozman for the one-year Farm Bill 
extension. Time is wasting and we have a sketchy situation over 
there on the other side of the building so we better get to 
work pretty quickly to get that five-year farm bill passed.
    There is a lot of opportunity with AI. I'm concerned about 
the viability of AI for our small-scale producers. We have a 
lot of small farms in Vermont. A lot of times something will 
come up that is an opportunity for bigger ag where you can 
spread the cost over time, but for a lot of small-scale 
producers they are skeptic about whether they can get a return 
on investment.
    A McKinsey poll fund that fifty-two percent of North 
American farmers cite high costs, and 40 percent cite uncertain 
returns as the biggest challenges to adopting farm-management 
systems. Many of our farmers have greater confidence in a 
fellow farmer or some of the folks from Extension, people they 
have worked with over the years. They have confidence in them 
to understand the dynamics of AI and agriculture. This is going 
to get to a point where we talk about the profitability over 
yield per acre.
    The big question I have about AI is with the entry cost. 
How can we do things that are going to help the smaller farmers 
get the benefit of AI when they are just not going to be able 
to take that risk about the high upfront cost. Can you address 
that, Dr. Earles?
    Dr. Earles. Absolutely. I think there are two buckets that 
I would put what AI might help farmers do. One is decision 
support. This has typically been the role for small farmers of 
Extension types of agents. They rely very heavily on Extension 
oftentimes for various sorts of advice. Then the other one is 
mechanization and automation, which I think those two can often 
come with very different costs associated with them.
    I think in terms of AI and their impact on those two areas, 
on the Extension side I mentioned this idea of there are not 
enough Extension agents out there right now, because really, 
they are experts in 100 different things.
    Senator Welch. Let me put a little ripple on it too, 
because in addition to that, the smaller farmers, a lot of 
times will be wanting to do this, focus on profitability and 
value added products. The data that goes into the AI algorithm 
is essentially generated by the larger operations. How is that 
going to make it more difficult for the smaller farms that have 
a different business model, in effect, to be able to take 
benefit of AI? How do we integrate that into the systems?
    Dr. Earles. Yep. I think there is an opportunity for using 
things people already have, like their phones, and people are 
taking advantage of this because our phones are loaded with 
many different types of sensors. You know, we may not realize 
it but there are probably 15 different types of sensors on 
there, from cameras through accelerometers, et cetera.
    I think there is an opportunity for smaller farmers, and 
people are leveraging this opportunity to develop products 
around phones.
    Senator Welch. Okay. Thank you. That is helpful. I will ask 
you, Mr. Krishnan, I know in your work you focus on 
profitability per acre to better incentivize climate-friendly 
practices. That is a big deal for our farmers. They are trying 
to do things that regenerate the soil. They are trying to do 
things that reduce the cost of a lot of these inputs so that 
their profitability is greater, at the end of the day, 
obviously what is important.
    Talk to me about AI and how our farmers can focus on 
profitability as opposed to anything else, really.
    Mr. Krishnan. I think what AI and better sensing allows you 
to do is focus on precision agriculture, so improve the 
resource efficiency of water, pesticide, fertilizer management. 
This should increase resource efficiency and profit per acre.
    I think the second thing that AI will allow us to do is 
sort of understand agriculture and the farm as a soil health 
asset class, and effectively really mine what is already 
naturally occurring in the topsoil.
    Senator Welch. Talk to me about that soil health, because 
that is a real concern for our farmers. I mean, everybody. The 
more of these inputs we have to put in, the herbicides, 
pesticides, and so on, the more it challenges the soil health, 
is what I understand.
    Mr. Krishnan. Yes. There are close to a trillion living 
things within six inches of our soil, and there are different 
consortia--microbes, fungi, bacteria. I think there is a real 
opportunity to focus on organic matter, which is a measurement 
of all that life----
    Senator Welch. The better the soil health, the higher the 
yield, right?
    Mr. Krishnan. Exactly.
    Senator Welch. Yes. Did you want to add something, Dr. 
Griffiths?
    Dr. Griffiths. Yes, if I may. The Extension Service at 
South Dakota State University just received a significant grant 
for soil conservancy in the State, to look at areas of soil in 
fields that are not very productive right now, and replanting 
natural grasses that go down sometimes 20 feet, with roots down 
20 feet----
    Senator Welch. Really?
    Dr. Griffiths [continuing]. to rejuvenate and re-nutrient 
the soil so that it will be available for future use. The idea 
of farming, on the one hand, and conservancy on the other, it 
is a balancing act, and AI is going to help with that balancing 
act saying where and when you should start conserving.
    Senator Welch. Yes. Well, I hope it is affordable to the 
smaller farmers. Thank you all very much. Madam Chair, thank 
you. I yield back.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Braun.
    Senator Braun. Thank you, Madam Chair. Before I got to the 
Senate I ran a company that was a distribution and logistics 
company, very kind of mundane, until we discovered technology. 
Once it was kind of beaten into my head in terms of being way 
too expensive for the benefits, the older of my two sons, who 
now run the company with one of their sisters, I became a 
believer in it. The benefits of it, amazing how it gets, in our 
case, a train to show up on time, figuratively speaking, how 
much it costs, but the benefits have always been there. Anymore 
I do not argue. I just say how much and we do it. Of course, it 
is not my decision anymore.
    We still, though, today, in touching base, have to fend off 
from across the world people trying to take your technology, 
and for no real good reason, disrupt it, run it, ransom it, all 
that.
    I want to use that as kind of what we deal with before we 
heard much about AI. I would like to ask Mr. Krishnan and Dr. 
Hindman your opinion, what the main worries would be when we 
take something as wholesome as agriculture and to see what we 
want to do with it, what would you see as being the biggest 
risks, in your mind, of how we apply AI to agriculture and not 
to have a maleficent end result in the process of doing it? We 
will start over here.
    Mr. Krishnan. It is a great question. I think AI is just 
like any other technology or toolkit. It has pros and cons. It 
can definitely increase productivity, as you saw in your 
business, but also increase disparity between small producers 
or large producers or people with access to those high value 
revenues and people who do not, people that have high sensor 
penetration and people that do not on farm.
    I think data has become this raw material for these 
algorithms to make them more valuable or productive and more 
profitable. I think a lot of what we have talked about today 
around data privacy, data ownership, cyber, are very critical. 
I think the biggest thing, whether it is in AI or in ag tech is 
really trust and transparency I think they are very important, 
and a lot is in the details and nuances. I really encourage 
maybe an expert working group to really tackle the issues 
around data ownership, data privacy, and data protection.
    Senator Braun. Thank you. Mr. Hindman.
    Dr. Hindman. Yes, I think, it is relatively easy to get a 
machine learning model to be 80 percent accurate. It is much 
harder to get it to be 99, 95 percent accurate, and the 
difference between those two is the difference in data. It is 
how much data you have, the quality of that data that is used 
to train the model.
    Data is the currency of artificial intelligence. It is what 
powers it. It is what makes it go. For an example, in the See & 
Spray application that we produce, where we are discriminating 
between weeds and healthy crops and spraying only the weeds, we 
created a dataset that is an image catalog, effectively, of 
millions of images of weeds at all different growth stages and 
different light conditions across corn, soy, cotton, across the 
southern part of the U.S. to the northern part of the U.S.
    This dataset is very, very valuable. It is what gives us 
the ability to discriminate a weed in the machine learning 
model across the geography of the United States in those three 
crop production systems. If you think about the value of that 
data, one of the things that keeps me awake at night is the 
threat actors that you mentioned having access to it so that 
they can go create something very, very similar without putting 
the effort into collecting the information that was necessary 
to produce it.
    Senator Braun. Thank you. Mr. Janzen, since you deal with 
the farmers in your practice and the industry itself, 
especially from the perspective of farmers, they need every 
tool they can get to nurse that extra dollar per acre out of a 
tough, tough business. We talked about that a little bit 
earlier. What are they saying that they are looking forward to 
out of it, and what risks are they talking about that might be 
associated with it?
    Mr. Janzen. Yes, thank you, Senator Braun. I would say that 
what they really want to see is return on investment, and they 
are always very reluctant, I think, to give over data to a lot 
of the companies that want to use it for, whether it is farm 
management system or training AI models. If they know that they 
are going to get at least an equal amount of value back in 
return for giving that data over, then I think it is worth it 
to them.
    Farming is their livelihood, and so that is why I think 
they have a reason to be skeptical of just turning over all 
this information about their livelihood to third parties unless 
there is that trust there.
    Senator Braun. I think that is a good point because my 
feeling is that is the toughest small business in the whole 
spectrum of enterprise to run, inherently low margin in an 
increasingly concentrated industry. Any leg up they can get, 
they need it, and ROI may be the best way to measure that.
    Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Lujan.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to our 
Ranking Member for this hearing.
    Dr. Earles, in your testimony you discussed research into 
how farms and workers can utilize AI technologies to monitor 
livestock, help provide nutrients, predict climate, and control 
irrigation. Yes or no, is there a work force ready to fully 
develop and operate these technologies so that farms across the 
Nation can fully benefit?
    Dr. Earles. Thank you. I think that is a great question. It 
really depends on which crop we are probably talking about, but 
across the board I would say that the work force is probably 
not as there in specialty crops, for example, as it may be 
where we have much more manual labor, and so there are a lot 
more difficult types of tasks humans are doing. I think maybe 
we are closer on the front where we already have major 
penetration and mechanization, so in some of the row crops and 
things like that, where maybe there is less manual labor.
    I think that is probably the biggest differentiator in my 
mind of what drives readiness for the work force.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that, and Madam Chair, I think 
that is just a reminder that the Committee not lose sight of 
the human component here as well as this conversation continues 
to grow.
    Dr. Earles, California has a large Spanish-speaking 
population, as does New Mexico. Are efforts being made to make 
AI-enabled agricultural technologies easy to use by non-English 
speakers?
    Dr. Earles. Yes, I will speak from an example in this case. 
I think if someone is not doing this, then the technology is 
not going to penetrate the market.
    Senator Lujan. Would you repeat that?
    Dr. Earles. Yes. I think if there is not an effort to make 
Spanish-first or at least bilingual in these tools, especially 
in specialty crops where we have predominantly Spanish-speaking 
workers, then the tools are unlikely to succeed. I have seen 
this firsthand in grape and wine industry, where people 
building tools internally are Spanish mode first.
    Senator Lujan. Dr. Hindman, would you agree with that?
    Dr. Hindman. I would.
    Senator Lujan. Is Deere doing it?
    Dr. Hindman. We do from an operations perspective in all of 
our equipment. The ability to operate the equipment exists in 
multiple language, Spanish being one of them.
    Senator Lujan. To operate. What about the AI component of 
all the smart stuff you all build into your tractors and farm 
equipment?
    Dr. Hindman. What we build into the tractors to this point 
has been largely visual. It is machine learning image 
recognition, so it is language agnostic, in a sense.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that, and I look forward to 
learning more about that.
    Mr. Krishnan, you firm helps identify and develop AI 
technologies in the agricultural sector. How can companies like 
yours work with Congress and other government agencies to 
ensure that full diversity of American farmers and farm workers 
have a say in the development and deployment of AI agricultural 
technologies?
    Mr. Krishnan. Thank you for that very important question.
    Our hope is AI can improve and democratize access to 
information, networks, and knowledge, and create a more level 
playing field. In order to do that you need to have smart 
policy and partnership with the private sector.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that very much. Dr. Hindman, 
there have been several conversations, questions around 
broadband connectivity and the importance of access, especially 
along the last acre, which I am proud to be working on with 
Senator Fischer, talking about last-acre connectivity. The idea 
here is to expand network connectivity across farmland and 
ranchland to ensure our rural communities and smaller farms can 
benefit from emerging technologies.
    You have deployed precision agricultural technology, Deere 
has, that allows for plant level management. Now yes or no, 
does every rural community in America have access to the 
wireless networks needed to support that level of precision ag?
    Dr. Hindman. It does not.
    Senator Lujan. How important is it to expand connectivity 
to allow that to occur?
    Dr. Hindman. Ultimately important.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that. Madam Chair, this is a 
question that I know many of us have been asking, especially 
those of us who represent more rural areas and more rural 
communities. With the commitments that were made with the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill with broadband, there was a 
commitment made that everyone was going to get connected. All 
of that was going to happen. As a former utility commissioner I 
pay attention to the filings at the FCC, and there are several 
of those companies that have been submitting those filings. One 
of them, I think, used an adage of, well, what about someone 
that lives down a longer road? What if it is too expensive to 
connect them? I thought that was the idea of the bill.
    I live down a long dirt road. I am sure a few of us do. It 
is just one of those reminders that if we are going to live up 
to the promise, especially in this particular space, of AI to 
help food production, improve profits for farmers and producers 
across the country, they need to have that simple technology 
that takes advantage of spectrum to be able to utilize these 
tools. I hope that is something else that we can impress up.
    Dr. Hindman, with Deere--and I appreciate your response to 
the threat actors having access to data. Now my question is, 
does Deere sell the data that they collect? Do they profit? Do 
they use a third party? Or does Deere keep that information 
just to themselves for their own product improvement?
    Dr. Hindman. We do not sell it. We are approached routinely 
by others who would like access to it. Our response is you have 
to go get approval from every farmer who has data that you are 
interested in.
    Senator Lujan. I want to thank you for that. I know that 
that is a tough decision, but especially as you are protecting 
the intellectual property, behavior, whatever it may be, or the 
confidence with those users as well. I just want to thank Deere 
for that and for your response here.
    Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much Senator Lujan. Let 
me just say that they used to say that it was too expensive to 
put the farmer at the end of the road into telephone or 
electricity, and somehow we managed to do that. I could not 
agree with you more. Senator Thune.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Madam Chair, and just as a 
followup to Senator Lujan's comments on some of these, there 
are tens of billions of dollars available, and yet I met last 
week, or the week before, with our independent telephone co-ops 
in South Dakota, and not a single one was applying for any of 
that money, partly because of all the regulations and red tape 
and requirements that have been attached to it. You have got to 
hire certain types of people. You know, the unions had their 
say in that. We are a right-to-work State. We do not have that 
kind of work force. Then, of course, there is all the climate 
requirements you have to prove.
    Yes, there are a lot of places in South Dakota, like the 
State that you represent, New Mexico, that desperately need 
that connectivity, and there are companies that are willing to 
invest and put money into it. That, to me, was pretty striking, 
that not a single one of them was going to apply for that 
funding because it just did not make sense for them 
economically.
    Let me come back, and I am going to try and combine several 
questions here into one, Dr. Griffiths. I think it is really 
important, and there is a bipartisan bill that I am working on 
that is focused on putting the right guardrails in place for 
the highest impact AI systems while also, at the same time, 
allowing for innovation. I think that is an important balance 
we have to strike.
    What I believe is important, as we think about that, that 
we keep innovation in it but we also know that there are 
riskier applications that are going to need a little bit, at 
least some amount of guardrails around it. Could you give a few 
examples of--and you mentioned this in your testimony--how new 
AI systems, the tools are being used to benefit agriculture? 
Second, what some of those risks are and why Congress needs to 
establish at least a light touch approach with respect to 
guardrails for AI deployment. Then you also mentioned the 
threat of unfriendly nations asserting themselves into U.S. 
agriculture, and maybe touch briefly why it is important for 
the U.S. to lead in innovation on artificial intelligence to 
stay ahead of some of those unfriendly nations that are also 
trying to deploy it in ways that would perhaps be detrimental 
to us.
    Dr. Griffiths. Thank you, Senator, for the complex 
question. Well, first of all, in terms of how AI is being used, 
we have talked a lot about that today. Precision agriculture or 
precision farming, precision ranching are being incorporated to 
improve yield, cut down on data processing and inform better 
farming practices. Examples include autonomous farming, the use 
of self-driving tractors, robots for crop inspection and crop 
harvesting. I am not an agricultural specialist so I am 
learning the vocabulary of agriculture. Autonomous systems used 
for spraying, et cetera.
    A number of agricultural startups are leveraging the power 
of data to use AI to better inform practice, and I do believe 
that with some of the recent developments in artificial 
intelligence technologies the cost of entry is lowering, not so 
much for the large data to train AI systems, but then once you 
have got the AI system available you can apply it to your own 
environment at a much lower expense.
    I think there are a lot of things that we can do. There is 
the individual field and the individual herd, if you like, that 
you can manage, but now you can go up a level and talk about 
how do you optimize the use of land, how do you optimize--we 
have talked about soil health and things of that kind. All of 
those are better informed by AI.
    In terms of establishing guardrails, I do believe very 
strongly in a lighter touch than heavy-duty regulation because 
the moment regulation gets too much, innovation shrinks, 
naturally. The United States has always had a lighter touch on 
regulation than other parts of the world, particularly, for 
example, Europe, which has its AI framework.
    I think it is important that we ensure that innovation can 
occur, but at the same time that we can have these guardrails 
to help mitigate risks. I know the beginnings of this have 
already started with companies volunteering efforts to make 
sure that they are appropriately secure, and hopefully that 
will continue and then hopefully the Senate and the House will 
begin to put some of these lighter guardrails in place. I do 
think under-regulation would put the industry and the public at 
risk, so it is that nuanced balance between how much regulation 
is sufficient. Involving the agricultural producers and 
providers and technologists in the conversation I think is 
going to be very important.
    Then in terms of unfriendly nations, we do get concerned 
that tends to be the high end of cybersecurity that I worry 
about on a regular basis. It keeps me up at night. The United 
States has a lead in artificial intelligence. It has the lead 
in the high end research activities. It has the advantage in 
the high end chips that are a piece of the infrastructure 
needed to do high end AI research.
    Some other countries are very interested in this, some 
because they want to use it for good, others because they do 
not wish us well. I do think that the United States needs to 
stay in a lead role, and then we might see unfriendly 
countries, or let's say less friendly countries, perhaps they 
will become fast followers of whatever we produce. Whatever we 
produce, they are going to take up as quickly as they can and 
mimic and deploy on their own.
    I do think it is important to maintain that research edge. 
It is what I believe has kept the United States in the lead for 
many, many decades, and I think it is important that investing 
in research in AI applications across multiple sectors is going 
to be very important.
    We are really talking about one of the 15 critical 
infrastructures in the United States. Agriculture is a critical 
infrastructure. It came quite late to the area of 
cybersecurity, if I might say. I think 2015 we finally saw the 
first USDA report on that. I think it is important to bring the 
agricultural sector into this world very, very quickly to 
advance the benefits of AI, which is moving very, very quickly, 
and is going to need the various infrastructures that exist, 
including 5G, and at the same time making sure we protect that 
infrastructure so the United States can stay one or two 
generations ahead of much of the rest of the world. It is the 
only way we are going to be able to move ahead.
    Senator Thune. It has been remarkable just the progress we 
have already made in precision agriculture and what that has 
done on yields and just productivity in our country and how 
that has improved the bottom lines of agriculture but also, as 
I mentioned earlier, makes us more competitive globally.
    Very quickly here--I see Senator Sullivan here--let me ask 
Mr. Hindman. When we think about precision ag technologies now 
that are utilized, how important is it that we, as 
policymakers, take a tech-neutral approach with respect to 
broadband deployment?
    Dr. Hindman. I think it is very important. I think the 
reality is to connect the last acre requires a different 
solution than to connect the last household, and in precision 
agriculture it is that last acre that is important.
    Senator Thune. Thank you. My time has expired, Madam Chair. 
I might submit some questions for the record, but thank you 
all.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Absolutely. Thank you so much. Senator 
Fischer, I almost did not see you. Senator Fischer is next, and 
then Senator Hoeven.
    Senator Fischer. I didn't want to get in the way----
    Chairwoman Stabenow. That was very courteous.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to 
our witnesses today. I appreciate you being here.
    I am glad to see this hearing today on how we can leverage 
technology to help our producers. Farmers and ranchers have 
been using precision agriculture technology to improve yields, 
reduce inputs, and optimize water usage. There are more ways 
that we can boost access to these tools right now.
    I have written several bills that focus on expanding access 
to advanced technologies and ensuring farmers and ranchers can 
fully utilize the benefits of precision ag technology. My 
Precision Ag Loan Program would provide dedicated financing for 
precision ag technologies. My PRECISE Act would leverage 
existing conservation programs to increase access to precision 
ag technologies. My Last Acre Act would expand network 
connectivity across farm and ranch land so these technologies 
can work reliably in the field. These bills have received broad 
stakeholder support. I appreciate the love this panel has shown 
these bills today, and I thank many of my colleagues here on 
this Committee who have joined me as co-sponsors on those 
bills.
    Just last week, the Joint FCC-USDA Precision Ag 
Connectivity Task Force voted to include both the PAL Act and 
the Last Acre Act as part of their final recommendations.
    We know that precision ag technologies give producers the 
ability to monitor and decrease their use of inputs, like 
fertilizer and water, while still producing safe, high quality 
crops. For example, precision agriculture's ability to optimize 
water usage is enormously important, particularly for our 
western States. Nebraska, for example, has 8.6 million acres of 
irrigated cropland, the most in the whole United States.
    Dr. Griffiths, in your written testimony you describe some 
of the benefits of precision agriculture. Would you please 
expand on the economic and environmental benefits that can be 
gained through the use of precision ag technologies?
    Dr. Griffiths. Yes. Thank you. Basically, the technologies 
allow much more specific information to be provided to the 
farmer or the rancher. As a result, they can use their 
resources sparingly, only when and where needed. That is 
basically why costs are reduced.
    Also, AI can allow us to identify and develop plants can be 
harvested more frequently so that you could actually 
potentially have two crops per year rather than one. I know 
there is a lot of research on the bio side of agriculture that 
is looking at how to develop these new crops and products and 
new things that you can grow. Same thing in animals, where we 
are doing that kind of research as well.
    Basically that is what AI allows us to do.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you. Despite the benefits that we 
have discussed here today, producers continue to face 
challenges adopting new precision ag technologies, and that is 
mostly due to the high cost and the lack of connectivity in 
rural areas.
    Mr. Hindman, I appreciate your testimony supporting the 
inclusion of my precision ag package in the farm bill. As a 
technology developer, can you explain some of the financial 
challenges facing producers in adopting these advanced 
technologies, and then second, even if producers can acquire 
the technology, what barriers prevent them from being able to 
fully leverage the precision ag technologies on their own farm?
    Dr. Hindman. Sure. Yes, the technologies that we are 
talking about--you know, graphical processing units, cameras, 
et cetera--are expensive technologies to start with. I think 
the first barrier is that initial cost of the technology, and 
that is a barrier to entry for some growers at some sizes into 
the market.
    Which is, I think, why it is important for these new-to-
world type of technologies for us to not just work on the 
technology development but the business model that accompanies 
it. We can shift the business model to make it more amenable to 
smaller farmers and pay-for-use type of mechanisms, those sorts 
of things. The business model I would expect to shift over time 
as well.
    Your second question, Senator, is a connectivity question, 
pure and simple. There are fundamentally technologies, and an 
increasing number of them, that will be in marketplace--they 
are in the marketplace today and will be in the marketplace in 
the future--that are connectivity dependent, connectivity 
ubiquitously throughout whatever the field is that the farmer 
happens to be using.
    Senator Fischer. Not just building to building, to be able 
to connect there. We have got to be able to look again at that 
last acre if we are truly going to make a difference.
    Dr. Hindman. Acre-based, not household-based.
    Senator Fischer. Exactly. Thank you. Thank you very much.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much, Senator Fischer. 
I just want to thank you for all your work in this area. 
Senator Boozman and I were just talking about that, the 
importance of having your work become part of what we are doing 
in the farm bill, so thank you very much. Senator Hoeven.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thanks to you and 
the Ranking Member for calling this meeting today. I appreciate 
it very much. Thanks to all of our witnesses.
    Senator Klobuchar and I have introduced bipartisan 
legislation to increase the loan limits, modernize loan limits 
for the Farm Service Agency Farm Loan Programs. We did that 
before the last farm bill and made that part of the farm bill. 
We are looking to do that again.
    Do all of you agree that we need to modernize those lending 
programs, increasing the loan limits, which would include not 
only the direct loans but also the guarantees and 
subordinations? I would welcome comments from any and all of 
you, unless they are in the negative.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Krishnan. I will be in the very positive. Thank you, 
Senator, for your question. I think particularly on the topic 
of AI in ag tech, as agriculture goes from data poor to data 
rich, it is not just about sensors and Internet of Things and 
getting the farm super connected. I think we can use that data 
to provide new risk and lending solutions to farmers, 
particularly as the U.S. business model goes from more rented 
acres as opposed to owned acres. I think it is really 
important.
    Senator Hoeven. Anybody disagree with that? Anybody want to 
add to it? Is there anything specific you want to see in these 
lending programs?
    Mr. Krishnan. I think just allowing for private sector 
involvement. Fintech has gone to small business, has gone to 
many other parts of our economy, to the consumer, but has not 
yet gone to agriculture, and there is a really interesting 
opportunity to provide more competition and products and 
services from fintech overall to the agriculture sector.
    Senator Hoeven. Would you also agree that it is very 
important for beginning farmers that we have these programs 
available, and that they are adequate to meet the needs?
    Mr. Krishnan. They provide a ladder to acquire working 
capital, to acquire farmland, and to bringing new generational 
farmers into the system.
    Senator Hoeven. Right, because we need to bring in your 
people and the capital barriers are significant with modern 
agriculture. You would agree with that?
    Mr. Krishnan. Absolutely.
    Senator Hoeven. Then in North Dakota we have a project 
called Grand Farm, which is conceptually to be an autonomous 
farm, where we are using AI and precision ag and all these 
incredible developments to develop a farm that is highly 
automated. In essence we say autonomous, although, of course, 
it would never be fully. Really to be on the cutting edge of 
the development of precision ag. John Deere is involved, as are 
many other, Microsoft. Many leading companies are involved in 
this incredible effort.
    Tell me, from each of your perspectives, how do you think 
you can bring resources to bear to help these kinds of efforts 
like Grand Farm? Since John Deere Controls has a major 
development office in Fargo, maybe you would start.
    Dr. Hindman. Sure. I think it is important. Grand Farm is a 
really good example of painting a picture of the future of what 
agriculture can be and to do it in a location that allows 
growers to see it sort of in their own backyard. I think that 
is incredibly important. It also provides an ecosystem where 
multiple entities, public and private, can collaborate on 
solutions within the context of a public farm that I think 
paints an interesting and compelling picture for the future.
    Senator Hoeven. Who else? What other ideas can you bring, 
either from higher ed or from the business world?
    Dr. Griffiths. I think it is a great idea to actually 
demonstrate what can be done. I think that will allow for sort 
of people to understand that it is available and to have some 
understanding of how it works and what it costs.
    We have had a slightly different approach, mainly because 
we do not have a Grand Farm Initiative. We have used virtual 
reality to demonstrate what that kind of precision agriculture 
could do. It is on a somewhat limited basis, but we are able to 
bring people in and demonstrate that you could be driving an 
autonomous vehicles, you can be riding in an autonomous 
vehicle. It can be doing all these things for you in the 
future, and give them a sense of it that way.
    Senator Hoeven. Dr. Griffiths, what is the most important 
thing that we can do include in NIFA funding this year?
    Dr. Griffiths. I think many of the things we have talked 
about--support for ongoing research and development, loans to 
farmers so that they can really get up and running and reduce 
the cost of entry for those small, independent farms.
    Senator Hoeven. Is there anything we should do in terms of 
the NIFA funding that you would recommend that could make it 
even more effective, I mean other than, I am sure, increasing 
the dollars. Are there recommendations you have regarding NIFA 
specifically, or anyone else?
    Dr. Earles. I might add one thing to it. In the NIFA 
funding one interesting piece to me is that across all of the 
different topics that you will see within NIFA, which is a lot, 
right, within AFRI, for example, there is an opportunity for AI 
to be embedded in almost every one of those.
    I think it is a cross-cutting technology, so how we can 
make it a cross-cutting type of opportunity I think is really 
important.
    Senator Hoeven. Yes. As the Chairwoman said, adding AI to 
the language in the right way, both to give you the authorities 
but also so that we are careful in its development. I would 
echo her thoughts on that.
    Thanks to all of you. Thanks, Madam Chair and the Ranking 
Member.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you so much. This has really 
been a terrific discussion, very helpful, and we have lots more 
to do. We look forward to working with you going forward. This 
is really important to our work in supporting future 
innovations. We know that agriculture is all about innovation, 
and that is how our farmers have been able to effectively feed 
the world with the most abundant, lowest cost, safest food 
supply in the world, which is what we all have.
    We have covered a lot of ground today. It is our 
responsibility, on the Committee, to ensure that America 
continues to lead the world in agricultural innovation, and I 
know that Senator Boozman joins me in strongly supporting that 
effort, to get that done. We look forward to working with every 
member of the Committee as we draft a strong bipartisan farm 
bill. This has been very helpful to us today.
    The record will remain open for five business days, and the 
hearing is adjourned.

    [Whereupon, at 11:48 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
