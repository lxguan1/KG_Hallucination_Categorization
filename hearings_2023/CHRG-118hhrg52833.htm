                        WEDNESDAY, JULY 19, 2023

                          House of Representatives,
               Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,
                                                   Washington, D.C.

    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:04 p.m., in 
room 2318 of the Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Frank 
Lucas [Chairman of the Committee] presiding.
    Chairman Lucas. The Committee will come to order.
    Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare 
recesses of the Committee at any time.
    Welcome to the Science Committee Members' Day hearing for 
the 118th Congress. And before we proceed, I would like to, by 
unanimous consent request, that a letter from Representative 
Pfluger of Texas referencing his priorities be added into the 
record. Seeing no objection, so ordered.
    I recognize myself for 5 minutes for an opening statement.
    Good afternoon, and welcome to the Science, Space, and 
Technology Committee's Members' Day hearing for the 118th 
Congress. I want to thank our colleagues for joining us today. 
We appreciate your time and look forward to hearing your 
priorities under the Committee's jurisdiction, especially those 
issues that are important to your districts.
    This Committee has a history of bipartisan consensus, 
dedicated to driving American scientific progress. Whether it's 
supporting pioneering research and basic science in our 
national labs, promoting cutting-edge technologies, or 
maintaining America's global leadership in space exploration, 
we are keen to foster meaningful advances that will not only 
benefit us today, but the generations of tomorrow. I look 
forward to continue our priorities as Congress and welcome my 
colleagues' thoughts on these important topics today.
    [The prepared statement of Chairman Lucas follows:]

    Good afternoon and welcome to the Science, Space, and 
Technology Committee's Members' Day hearing for the 118th 
Congress.
    I want to thank our colleagues--both on the Committee and 
off--for joining us today. We appreciate your time and look 
forward to hearing your priorities under the Committee's 
jurisdiction, especially those issues that are important to 
your districts.
    This Committee has a history of bipartisan consensus, 
dedicated to driving American scientific progress.
    Whether it's supporting pioneering research and basic 
science at our national labs, promoting cutting edge 
technologies, or maintaining America's global leadership in 
space exploration, we are keen to foster meaningful 
advancements that will not only benefit us today, but the 
generations of tomorrow.
    I look forward to continuing our priorities this Congress 
and welcome my colleagues' thoughts on these important topics 
today.
    I now recognize the Ranking Member for her opening 
statement.

    Chairman Lucas. I now recognize the Ranking Member for her 
opening statement.
    Ms. Lofgren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and for this hearing 
today. I look forward to hearing from our witness and our 
colleague. The Space and Science Committee has looked at a lot 
of important issues so far this Congress from artificial 
intelligence (AI), drones, advanced air mobility systems, and 
most importantly, fusion energy. And when you say it out loud, 
you realize how much this Committee really is about the future.
    These topics should never be partisan issues, and I want to 
once again acknowledge you, Mr. Chairman, for your efforts to 
work toward bipartisan consensus. It is in keeping with the 
long tradition of this Committee, and it's really the only way 
that we can address these profound issues in a meaningful and 
thoughtful way. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back, and I 
look forward to hearing from our colleague.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Lofgren follows:]

    Thank you, Chairman Lucas, for holding today's hearing. I 
look forward to hearing from Members today to hear their 
priorities for the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.
    So far this Congress, the Science Committee has looked at 
an array of issues- from artificial intelligence, to fusion 
energy, to drones and advanced air mobility systems. When you 
say it out loud you realize just how much this Committee is 
really about the future.
    These topics shouldn't be partisan issues, and I want to 
once again acknowledge Chairman Lucas and his efforts to try 
and work with bipartisan consensus. It is in keeping with the 
long tradition of this Committee, and it's really the only way 
we can address these profound issues in a meaningful 
andthoughtful way.
    I thank the Chair, and I yield back.

    Chairman Lucas. Thank you. Thank you, Ranking Member 
Lofgren. Other Members are welcome to submit written statements 
for the record.
    Our colleague, Representative Lee from the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania, is recognized for 5 minutes to present her 
testimony.
    Ms. Lee. Thank you, Chairman Lucas, Ranking Member Lofgren. 
Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the opportunities for 
this body to be more reflective of the Nation it serves.
    This Committee strives to excellence and enhance innovation 
and problem-solving through funding and direction we provide 
these agencies to carry out groundbreaking research. For too 
long, we have failed to prioritize or even acknowledge the vast 
contributions that the Black community and other minoritized 
groups have made toward scientific discovery and innovation. 
Well-documented gaps exist between the number of recognized 
works produced by women compared to men in science, bearing 
significant consequences for the retention and promotion of 
women.
    Black and Brown bodies have for centuries been used to save 
the lives of others while losing our own. For example, the 
genetic materials of Henrietta Lacks, taken without consent, 
has been studied and use globally in major developments on 
vaccine production, cancer treatments, fertility treatments, 
and numerous other applications. Katherine Johnson's hand-
calculated orbital equations where electronic machines failed 
helped NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) 
safely send an astronaut into space and back to Earth. Her 
coauthored report on orbital spaceflight just 2 years prior was 
the first time a woman in the flight research division received 
credit as an author of a research report. This highlights the 
ethical imperative for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) 
in the scientific fields, unbiased pursuit of knowledge without 
discrimination, promoting fairness and equal opportunities for 
all.
    The 118th Congress has demonized all things remotely 
related to DEI. It's not surprising, seeing that one of my 
colleagues just last week referred to Black people as colored 
people on the House floor. When I look up at the walls of this 
Committee room and only see one person who looks like me, I 
feel reminded that many people for a long time did not believe 
that people like me belong here. Eddie Bernice Johnson, the 
first and only Black person to ever chair this Committee, she 
dedicated 40 years of her life to public service, and her work 
championed STEM (science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics) education, diversity--and diversity. Fittingly, 
her contributions helped generational investment through the 
CHIPS and Science Act. And that became law. She leaves a legacy 
of providing access to career paths and opportunities in STEM 
for countless Americans across the country. I look at her work, 
and I'm inspired to make sure some more diverse portraits are 
hung on this wall.
    Diversity fosters a wider range of ideas and approaches, 
leading to more innovative solutions and better problem-solving 
capabilities in the scientific community. As legislators who 
are entrusted with driving the policies that will help shape 
the Nation for years to come, we are better-positioned to serve 
our constituents, our country by listening to individuals with 
diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences.
    Last month, I introduced and withdrew an amendment at the 
request of Chairman Lucas that encapsulates my legitimate 
concerns on disparate impacts AI technologies have on people 
that look like me. Chairman Lucas and this Committee have been 
supportive of addressing these issues, and I'm eager to discuss 
what progress has been made on this in any way I or my staff 
can be supportive of that work.
    I also look forward to circulating and presenting a letter 
to Chairman Lucas and Ranking Member Lofgren highlighting the 
need for improved representation in the witnesses we invite to 
testify before us. The scientific community serves the public 
interest through space, science, and technology. Inviting a 
more diverse pool from the scientific community ensures that 
research questions, methodologies, and findings are more 
reflective of the American population that research serves--
aims to serve, excuse me. To inspire the next generation of 
innovators, we must commit to fully embracing diversity, 
equity, and inclusion, fundamental principles that hold immense 
significance in the scientific field. These cannot be mere 
buzzwords.
    Many of my colleagues on this Committee have had more 
experience on analyzing scientific topics than me, but my 
constituents sent me to this seat to address the unique 
everyday needs and challenges faced by communities in western 
Pennsylvania. You don't need to be an astrophysicist to be a 
member of this Committee, and that is a good thing.
    The work this Committee does has an impact on people of all 
creeds, all backgrounds, regardless of your last name or your 
alma mater. When I chose to be a Member of the Science--of the 
Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I did so to help 
create a more equitable and just society, specifically within 
the realm of STEM. Embracing DEI initiatives and ensuring 
diverse representation among congressional witnesses will be a 
crucial step this Committee can take towards creating a more 
inclusive, innovative, and ethical future for everyone. Thank 
you.

congressional witnesses will be a crucial step this committee 
can take towards creating a more inclusive, innovative, and 
ethical future for everyone.

    Chairman Lucas. Thank you, Congresswoman, for the very 
thoughtful statement. The testimony given in these hearings is 
very important to us. I would acknowledge that I agree with 
you. My formal training is as an agricultural economist. And 
while the inelasticity of the demand for food, which is a key 
issue in ag econ, occasionally will put people to sleep, 
nonetheless, economics is about taking limited resources and 
allocating them amongst unlimited demands to create the 
greatest possible return--rate of return.
    Our people in this great country is our greatest asset and 
our greatest resource. How we make sure that everyone has a 
fair and equitable opportunity to live up to their potential 
will determine everyone's future.
    That said, I do share your concerns about the disparate 
impacts of AI. And that is one of many facets we must consider 
as we address the development of the technology. And I remain 
committed to working with you and the Ranking Member on this 
issue and supporting the development of fair, transparent, 
unbiased, artificial intelligence.
    Again, thank you for being who you are and the 
representative of your constituents that you are. And with 
that, I yield back.
    And I believe the Ranking Member seeks recognition for 5 
minutes.
    Ms. Lofgren. I do. And first, let me thank you for your 
testimony. I am sure that your constituents are proud to see 
you here not only today, but every day and the contributions 
you make to our Committee, as well as to our country.
    I agree with you that diversity is one of our greatest 
strengths as a nation, and that ensuring that our agencies and 
the broader science and tech community, as well as our witness 
panels reflect the beautiful diversity of our Nation is an 
important endeavor.
    Now, I had the honor of serving with Eddie Bernice Johnson 
for the entire time I've been in Congress. I was--became a 
Member of Congress in January of 1995, and her years of work on 
STEM diversity, which was codified in the CHIPS and Science 
Act, was extremely meaningful and is making a difference around 
the country today. And I am sure that our Committee and every 
Member understands we can continue to build on her fabulous 
record, so we owe her a lot.
    I have just a couple of questions if I could. Greenhouse 
gas emissions, as we know, are fueling more frequent and more 
devastating weather-related disasters. Now you're a freshman 
Member of Congress, but you have had an environmental justice 
advocacy role prior to your service here. How do you look 
forward to championing that cause on this Committee?
    Ms. Lee. Thank you, Ranking Member, for that question. As 
we know, climate change and our climate crisis is a massively 
critical issue that can't be solved in one Congress. I believe 
this Committee's work will be an important start. Abandoned oil 
and gas wells are a growing problem in the United States as we 
transition to a clean energy economy. Some unplugged wells date 
back to the 1850's and continually emit methane and cause 
environmental damage. I and my colleague Rep. Bice plan to 
introduce our bipartisan Abandoned Well and Remediation 
Research and Development Act to create an abandoned wells 
research development and demonstration program at the 
Department of Energy. I look forward to working with both of 
you, of course, at the eventual markup to make this legislation 
as thorough as possible to support R&D (research and 
development) that will help drastically reduce methane 
emissions.
    Ms. Lofgren. Thank you for that, and I look forward to 
working with you on that. As matter of fact, California just 
today announced a program for capping abandoned wells to try 
and reduce emissions, and I'm hoping that will be very 
successful.
    One final question. A few weeks ago, as you mentioned, we 
had a hearing on artificial intelligence and machine learning 
and some of the practical applications. And at that time, you 
highlighted how both have the potential to possibly criminalize 
people of color, who have historically been victims of racial 
bias in the algorithms that are used in AI and machine 
learning. Can you highlight any examples of these biases and 
resulting consequences? And do you have thoughts on what are 
some of the more worrying implications of the use of AI and 
machine learning in law enforcement that would inform our 
thinking in terms of what we might do to set guardrails and 
prevent harm?
    Ms. Lee. Yes, so this technology has become more and more 
common in recent years. It's--but when we--when I think about 
the question you're asking, a case that comes to mind is the 
case of Randall Reed. That makes us worry about the criminal 
justice system that almost indiscriminate--indiscriminately 
incarcerates Black and Brown people, and it's going to be 
worsened by AI. In Randall's case, he was wrongly arrested and 
jailed for a crime he didn't commit, and it was in a State that 
he had not been in. But the reason why he had been jailed is 
because there was a use of a bad facial recognition match. Six 
days he spent in jail, thousands of dollars he had to spend on 
lawyers, and really an investigation to find these answers, 
right? It was irreparable damage to his mental well-being and 
his loved ones who have went through--gone through that with 
him because of this colorblind technology.
    But the reality is, is that in this case, you know, it was 
not even documented that there was a use of this technology, 
this facial recognition technology, which is why we had the 
factfinding mission that there was to even figure out that this 
was him or that this is how he was identified. So the detective 
who sought the arrest warrant and affidavit, he said that there 
was only--that he had only been advised by a credible source. 
In this case, there was no source. It was AI. It sets a 
dangerous precedent that this Committee, I believe, has a 
responsibility to answer or really to kind of account for.
    That's why it's so important that we look at the biases 
that AI technology presents, that we look at ways that, as we 
are providing and kind of got that guidance and the--excuse me, 
directing money for R&D, that we are aware of these biases, 
that we are aware of the ways in which they're being used in 
our criminal legal system, and that we take those into account 
as we are pushing forward and forging forward with this 
technology that's inevitable, of course, but making sure that 
we're using it in the best way possible and that we are 
supporting the development in an ethical and biased--and 
unbiased ways.
    Ms. Lofgren. Thank you for that. And it stimulates a lot of 
ideas on my part and how we might take a look at the data bases 
that are used for machine learning to make sure that they are 
not feeding discrimination, as well as holding those who rely 
on to--on machine learning and then have detrimental outcomes 
to have some culpability for that.
    But with that, I just want to thank you for your thoughtful 
presentation, and I will yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Lucas. With that, the gentlelady yields back.
    Seeing no other questions, I want to thank the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania for her valuable testimony and the other 
members of the Committee.
    Seeing no further witnesses at this time, the record will 
remain open for 10 days for additional comments and written 
questions from Members. This hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 2:19 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
