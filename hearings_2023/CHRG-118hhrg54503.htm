      Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations,
                            Committee on Veterans' Affairs,
                                                   Washington, D.C.
    The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:03 a.m., in 
room 360, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Jen Kiggans 
[chairwoman of the subcommittee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives Kiggans, Radewagen, Bergman, 
Rosendale, Mrvan, Pappas, and Cherfilus-McCormick.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF JENNIFER A. KIGGANS, CHAIRWOMAN

    Ms. Kiggans. Good morning. The subcommittee will come to 
order. Thank you all for being here today as the subcommittee 
conducts important oversight on VA's background check process. 
To obtain VA employment, applicants must go through a three-
part background check. First, applicants must self report 
information, including violations of law. Second, applicant 
fingerprints are submitted to the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) for a criminal history check. Finally, the 
Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency investigates 
the applicant. During each step of this process, VA staff 
reviews relevant information to determine if the applicant is 
qualified, competent, and suitable for the position they are 
applying to. If the background check reveals an applicant has a 
felony-controlled substance related conviction, and the 
applicant will have access to controlled substances in their VA 
position, the VA must submit a waiver for Drug Enforcement 
Agency or DEA approval.
    Though these background checks take time, they are a 
crucial part of the hiring process. Even though there has been 
a lot of pressure to hire as many VA employees as possible, it 
is also crucial that the right people care for our veterans so 
veterans and their family members know they are in safe hands. 
Individuals with a controlled substance criminal history should 
not, absent a DEA employment waiver, be hired for positions 
where they have access to controlled substances.
    When the wrong people are hired for the job, veteran safety 
is put at risk. Just a few years ago, one of VA's nursing 
assistants in Clarksburg, West Virginia, murdered seven 
patients after deliberately administering lethal insulin 
dosages. Since then, there have been numerous instances where 
medical professionals have been caught stealing medication that 
is procured for veterans. These instances contributed to the 
more than 1,400 incidents of controlled substance theft or loss 
at VA, about 7 percent of the 20,000 total incidents reported 
to the DEA in 2021.
    Given the VA's consistent failure to get rid of its few bad 
employees, including in situations I have heard about, like 
employee drug theft, it is crucial that the VA does not hire 
dangerous employees in the first place. Despite the importance 
of effectively carrying out the employee background check 
process, evidence suggests the VA is failing to follow the law 
and commonsense policy, resulting in background check 
deficiencies.
    Inspector General (IG) reports in both 2019 and 2023 
highlight major issues with the VA's management of the 
background check process. The 2023 report outlines how the VA 
background investigations are often initiated late, not timely, 
or not properly documented, in violation of the VA's own 
policies. Disturbingly, the report also highlights in some 
cases for unknown reasons, applicants have never had background 
investigations done in the first place. This includes hundreds 
of employees with indications of a controlled substance related 
criminal history that Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
estimates have not completed background investigations.
    The absence of these background investigations is alarming, 
as DEA regulations require employers, including the VA, to 
apply for and receive employment waivers for those with access 
to controlled substances who were convicted of a controlled 
substance related felony. Simply put, this is not optional. 
These DEA regulations are in place to prevent drug theft and 
loss, which is common at the VA, unfortunately.
    Evidence suggests the VA is not properly executing DEA 
employment waivers as well. GAO in both 2019 and 2023, found 
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has a zero DEA employment 
waiver policy in place, including guidance for determining 
whether employees have access to controlled substances. I am 
very concerned that over 4 years have passed since the VA was 
first made aware of these deficiencies, and there has still 
been little to no progress made to improve the background check 
process. I look forward to all of you testifying before us 
today explaining why the VA has failed to fix the deficiencies 
in its background check and DEA employment waiver process. With 
that, I now recognize Ranking Member Mrvan for his opening 
comments.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF FRANK J. MRVAN, RANKING MEMBER

    Mr. Mrvan. Thank you, Chair Kiggans. I appreciate you 
holding this hearing. Ensuring VA has an effective and robust 
workforce is a priority for me. As the Department implements 
the Honoring Our PACT Act and its monumental expansion of 
veterans benefits, it is critical VA has the staff it needs to 
support existing and new veterans entering the VA healthcare 
system. It is equally critical that those new VA workers have 
the required skills and background as we entrust them to care 
for our veterans. I share Chair Kiggans's concerns about the 
deficiencies in VA personnel suitability program that have been 
identified by the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the 
Government Accountability Office.
    I hope this hearing can help us identify ways to improve 
VA's process for screening employees so that we can strike the 
right balance of swiftly onboarding the staff we need while 
promptly and accurately vetting them to ensure patient safety. 
The length of VA's onboarding process has long been cited as a 
recruitment and retention issue. Historically, VA has struggled 
to attract and keep talent due in part to the lengthy timeline 
to get prospective staff to work after an offer of employment 
is made. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) authorized VA to use hiring 
flexibilities in an expedited process to get staff into 
positions more quickly. However, there are risks associated 
with instituting a quicker process, and there need to be 
safeguards in place to ensure that the hired staff have the 
background and skills needed to care for and deliver benefits 
to our veterans.
    After reviewing the testimony prepared by our witnesses 
today, it seems to me that a common thread and core cause of 
weaknesses in vetting is staffing. This is a bit circular, but 
it appears that VA does not have the requisite staffing levels 
needed to onboard additional staff. The areas of improvement 
identified by both the IG and the GAO all seem to center around 
the fact that VA does not have enough qualified personnel to 
run its personnel suitability program. This has created an 
unattainable cycle of staff shortages, causing new staff to 
enter the VA workforce without the completion of appropriate 
and required vetting.
    I am particularly concerned by the IG's findings related to 
the VA Information Technology (IT) system that are used to 
track and manage background check processes. In my role last 
Congress as the Technology Modernization Subcommittee Chairman, 
I frequently did deep dives into VA software capabilities. VA 
currently has two information systems to manage the 
sustainability determination process, HR Smart and the VA 
Centralized Adjudication Background Investigation System, or 
VA-CABS. In its review of the VA's personnel suitability 
program, the VA IG identified issues with these data management 
systems and determined the use of the multiple data systems can 
lead to missing or inaccurate information.
    I hope to hear an update today from the VA on its 
implementation of the VA-CABS 2.0 and its plan to ensure that 
future systems offer the functionality needed to effectively 
oversee and manage the background investigation process. I am 
disappointed that VA did not make sustained improvements of the 
execution or oversight of its personnel suitability program 
between the 2018 and 2023 IG audits. This hearing serves as an 
opportunity for VA to commit to plans to improve staffing 
levels and data management throughout the functions of its 
personnel suitability and credentialing programs. I look 
forward to the VA following up on the coming months as to its 
progress.
    Finally, I was disturbed by the GAO's findings related to 
the VA's lack of control procedures for determining whether 
employees who have access to controlled substances have been 
adequately vetted. Again, this process seems to be stifled by 
VA not having enough staff to operate and oversee an effective 
background check and credentialing process in compliance with 
the policy and regulation related to the Controlled Substance 
Act. Ensuring all practitioners who care for veterans are in 
compliance with the Controlled Substance Act and the DEA 
policies is important, and I hope to hear today from our 
witnesses how this vetting process translates for care veterans 
receive from community providers.
    Thank you to our witnesses for being here today, and I look 
forward to a productive conversation. With that, I yield back.
    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you, Ranking Member Mrvan. We will now 
turn to witness testimony. Testifying before us today on our 
panel we have Mr. Daniel Galik, the Executive Director for 
Identity Credential and Access Management in the Office of 
Human Resources and Administration, Operations, Security and 
Preparedness (HRA/OSP) at the Department of Veteran Affairs. We 
have Ms. Jessica Bonjorni, the Chief of Human Capital 
Management at the Veteran Health Administration. We have Mr. 
Shawn Steele, Director of the Healthcare Infrastructure 
Division at the Office of Inspector General. We have Mr. Seto 
Bagdoyan, Director for Audit Services in the U.S. Government 
Accountability Office for Forensic Audits and Investigative 
Service. Will the witnesses please stand and raise your right 
hand and be sworn in.
    [Witnesses sworn.]
    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you very much. Let the record reflect 
that the witnesses answered in the affirmative. Mr. Galik, you 
are now recognized for 5 minutes to provide your testimony.

                   STATEMENT OF DANIEL GALIK

    Mr. Galik. Thank you. Good morning, Chairwoman Higgins, 
Ranking Member Mrvan, and members of the subcommittee. Thank 
you for the opportunity to discuss the Department of Veterans 
Affairs Human Resources background investigation and 
suitability programs and processes. I am accompanied today by 
Jessica Bonjorni, Chief Human Capital Management, Veterans 
Health Administration.
    VA recognizes that rigorous suitability protocols for its 
workforce are vital to maintaining the trust of veterans, 
caregivers, and veterans' families. VA's suitability program 
aligns with the guidelines established by the Office of 
Personnel Management. Preemployment screening and suitability 
determinations are mandatory for Federal employees to determine 
their suitability for employment.
    Once a tentative offer of employment has been made to the 
applicant, VA begins preemployment screening. At this stage, 
self-declared information and available criminal history are 
reviewed. In line with Federal regulations, any issues 
identified during the preemployment screening process are 
forwarded to a trained adjudicator for review and appropriate 
action. If the adjudicator cannot mitigate the issues found 
during the preemployment screening process, VA may withdraw the 
offer.
    An applicant's qualifications and credentialing 
requirements are also reviewed by VA's credentialing and 
privileging staff. If issues are identified with professional 
licensing or credentialing, these are communicated to HR to 
determine the appropriate follow-up action. If an applicant has 
a favorable initial screening, a background investigations is 
initiated at the appropriate level for the position with the 
Defense, Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA).
    After the background investigation is completed by DCSA, a 
final suitability determination is made by a VA suitability 
adjudicator. This determination involves a review of a person's 
character or conduct that may have impact on the integrity or 
efficiency of the service. When issues are discovered after a 
person is hired, such as when a report or an alert is received 
by the VA from DCSA or other sources, these reports and alerts 
are reviewed by a VA adjudicator and HR staff. If necessary, VA 
or HR may initiate the appropriate action on employees that are 
past their probationary period.
    In late 2020, VA established working groups to conduct 
governance, oversight, and compliance and to review the 
processes used within VA to initiate background investigations 
and the subsequent adjudication by VA staff. Process 
enhancements were identified and implemented for instances 
where there were weaknesses in how background investigations 
were adjudicated by VA's adjudicators. VA has made progress, 
but more work is needed to strengthen governance, oversight, 
compliance, and policies.
    VA is also addressing weaknesses in the governance of the 
suitability program, as identified in September 2023 VA OIG 
audit. HRA/OSP is developing an updated plan with each 
administration to establish this more robust governance and 
oversight of VA's personnel suitability program, including 
conducting program reviews at VA facilities, updating policies 
and oversight processes, verifying that background 
investigations are initiated and adjudicated within prescribed 
timelines, and that documentation is filed as required.
    The administration, and in particular VHA, has taken action 
to create a more structured approach to oversight and 
compliance. The VA, HR and suitability programs are working 
with the VA CIO's information technology team to also address 
and resolve the data quality and other issues identified with 
our IT systems that support the HR and suitability programs.
    We appreciate this opportunity to share more information on 
VA's background investigation and HR processes and how VA helps 
protect our veterans. Our objective is to give the Nation's 
veterans the top-quality care they have earned and deserve by 
carefully and thoroughly vetting all personnel who will 
interact with veterans, their families, and others at VA. We 
appreciate this subcommittee's continued support and 
encouragement. This concludes my testimony.

    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you so much, Mr. Galik. Mr. Steele, you 
are now recognized for 5 minutes to provide your testimony.

                   STATEMENT OF SHAWN STEELE

    Mr. Steele. Good morning. Chairwoman Kiggans, Ranking 
Member Mrvan, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for 
the opportunity to testify on the OIG's oversight of VA's 
personnel suitability program. A high performing screening 
program is critical for VHA to ensure the integrity of its 
workforce, to support the delivery of safe, high-quality 
patient care, and to protect sensitive information from misuse.
    As the OIG has documented, VA faces significant staffing 
shortages across many of its programs, including critical 
positions within VHA. These staffing shortages extend to human 
resources and personnel suitability staff essential to the 
hiring and vetting process. We have published reports on 
deficiencies in the personnel suitability program for several 
years. Our 2018 report recommended that VA and VHA establish 
robust oversight, ensure reliable investigation data are 
collected and maintained, correct data integrity issues, and 
implement a plan to review the suitability status of all VHA 
personnel. While we closed those recommendations between 2019 
and 2022, the OIG became concerned that the program was not 
sustaining the improved controls.
    Our September 2023 follow-up audit had two main findings. 
First, neither VA nor VHA provided effective governance of the 
program, and second, they lacked adequate IT systems to ensure 
that required background investigations were completed timely. 
In our first finding, we identified that VA did not 
consistently initiate or adjudicate background investigations 
timely or at all. In multiple instances, staff were in position 
to provide direct patient care without being vetted.
    These issues occurred because neither VA nor VHA dedicated 
sufficient resources to carry out key internal controls or 
accomplish program tasks. HRA/OSP suspended required 
inspections of the suitability program due to insufficient 
staffing. VHA's Workforce Management Consulting office also did 
not conduct program reviews of its suitability functions, 
largely delegating oversight to the Veterans Integrated 
Services Networks (VISNs). The VISNs, however, lacked 
sufficient staff to consistently perform their 
responsibilities. VISN personnel security chiefs reported they 
did not consistently review their suitability programs because 
they were covering for VISN staffing shortages. Many VISN 
suitability specialists also reported difficulty handling their 
workload.
    Our report highlighted examples of facilities that were 
supported by only one adjudicator despite employee counts 
ranging from 1,200 to 4,700 Full-Time Equivalency (FTE). We 
issued four recommendations for this first finding calling on 
VA to refocus its oversight of VHA's personnel suitability 
program and implement updated staffing metrics to ensure 
requirements were met.
    Next, we found that VA's background investigation data and 
information systems were insufficient to track the status of 
investigations or conduct program oversight. For example, HR 
Smart data were not consistently up to date. Similarly, 
critical VA-CABS data fields were either empty or inaccurate.
    While we recognize VA has now replaced VA-CABS, they did 
not provide us with evidence during our audit that VA-CABS 2.0 
will address known program and data weaknesses. As such, VA may 
have allocated resources toward developing a system that has 
functionality issues or duplicates other efforts given that a 
governmentwide suitability IT system is in development.
    Unless data reliability and system design and functionality 
are improved, VA lacks assurance that investigations have been 
fully processed and data integrity concerns have been 
mitigated. For this finding, we issued three recommendations 
for VA to collect and maintain sufficient and appropriate data 
to track investigations, as well as ensure that future systems 
can support the management and oversight of the background 
investigation process.
    The issues found in this report persisted from 2018, and a 
single responsible party was needed to coordinate corrective 
actions taken by HRA/OSP and VHA, all seven of the report's 
recommendations were issued to the Deputy Secretary. VA 
concurred with all the recommendations which remain open. In 
conclusion, the OIG remains committed to continued oversight of 
VA's personnel suitability program because of its importance to 
onboarding a highly qualified workforce and because of the risk 
to veterans, their family members, and staff if employees are 
not fully vetted. Presently, OIG audit teams are evaluating the 
personnel suitability programs in Veterans Benefits 
Administration (VBA) and National Cemetery Administration (NCA) 
to gain an enterprise-wide perspective. Additionally, the OIG 
is assessing VA's compliance with requirements for vetting 
contractor employees.
    Madam Chairwoman, this concludes my statement. I would be 
happy to answer any questions you or members of the 
subcommittee may have.

    [The Prepared Statement Of Shawn Steele Appears In The 
Appendix]

    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you, Mr. Steele. Mr. Bagdoyan, you are 
now recognized for 5 minutes to provide your testimony.

                   STATEMENT OF SETO BAGDOYAN

    Mr. Bagdoyan. Thank you. Chairwoman Kiggans, Ranking Member 
Mrvan, members of the Subcommittee, I am pleased to appear 
before you today to discuss GAO's February 2023 report on VHA's 
employee screening process. As context, VHA operates one of the 
largest healthcare systems in the Nation, with over 9 million 
veterans enrolled in the VHA healthcare program. VHA is 
responsible for ensuring that its 400,000-plus healthcare 
providers and support staff are qualified, competent, and 
suitable to provide safe care to veterans.
    Of this number, we identified 12,569 employees with 
indications of criminal history related to controlled 
substances, of whom we estimate 1,800 had felony convictions. A 
projectable sample of 305 from this universe constituted the 
basis of our analyses. We referred over 12,500 out of the 
original number to VHA for review and appropriate action.
    My remarks today will address our report's two principal 
findings, the extent to which VHA has responded to adverse 
information regarding its employees' criminal history or DEA 
registrations. Second, whether vulnerabilities exist in VHA's 
processes for completing and documenting employee background 
investigations or BIs. Our bottom line, our findings pose a 
double risk. As you mentioned, first, harm to veterans' care 
and also diversion of controlled substances for illegal 
purposes.
    Regarding our first finding, VHA received adverse 
information about some employees, but lacked policies and 
controls to ensure it responded as required. For example, VHA 
received information about some employees' control substance 
related felony convictions and actions taken against certain 
employees by DEA. VHA was required to obtain waivers from DEA 
for any of these employees whose job involved access to 
controlled substances. Specifically, from our projectable 
sample, we identified 50 employees who had one or more felony 
convictions related to controlled substances. VHA did not 
request DEA waivers for 48 of these individuals and could not 
confirm it requested waivers for the other two.
    At the time of our review, VHA did not have a waiver policy 
to guide its actions, but nevertheless determined that no 
waivers were required. Without such a policy, including 
guidance for determining whether an employee has access to 
controlled substances, VHA cannot assess whether its employees 
require waivers. Further, VHA risks that its facilities are not 
consistently complying with DEA regulations designed to control 
against theft and diversion of controlled substances.
    Regarding our second finding, we identified vulnerabilities 
in VHA's processes for completing employee background 
investigations. Specifically, we found that 13 employees in our 
projectable sample did not have a background investigation 
completed as required by both OPM guidance and VA policy. VHA 
was not aware of this until we brought the matter to its 
attention.
    Without adequate controls to ensure that it completes 
background investigations as required, VHA lacks reasonable 
assurance that its employees are properly vetted and suitable 
to provide care to veterans. In our February 2023 report, we 
made 14 recommendations to VHA, including five involving 
finalizing and implementing a DEA waiver policy and others for 
establishing controls to ensure that BIs are completed and 
documented. VHA agreed with the recommendations and outlined 
some actions in response, including reviewing a draft policy on 
waivers with a March 2024 target for implementation. As of 
today, all recommendations remain open.
    In closing, I would note first that our findings are 
consistent with those that resulted in veterans healthcare 
being added to GAO's high-risk list in 2015 involving ambiguous 
policies, inconsistent processes, and inadequate oversight. 
They are also generally consistent with the Veterans 
Administration-Office of Inspector Genera's (VA-OIG's) findings 
that Mr. Steele just enumerated. Second, the control 
deficiencies we identified could have broader implications for 
the vetting of all VHA employees beyond those with just 
criminal histories. Accordingly, VHA should act decisively and 
implement our recommendations in a timely fashion to enhance 
its oversight of and controls over employee vetting and help 
minimize the risks I identified.
    Chairwoman Kiggans, Ranking Member Mrvan, and members of 
the subcommittee, this concludes my opening remarks. I would be 
pleased to answer your questions. Thank you.

    [The Prepared Statement Of Seto Bagdoyan Appears In The 
Appendix]

    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you very much for all of your 
testimonies. We will now move to questions, and I yield myself 
5 minutes first. Mr. Galik how does the DEA define access to a 
controlled substance?
    Mr. Galik. Chairwoman, I am going to defer to my colleague 
here as the VHA team is working the details of the DEA waiver 
policy.
    Ms. Kiggans. Okay.
    Ms. Bonjorni. Yes, thank you. The DEA definition of access 
to controlled substances includes anyone who dispenses or 
administers a controlled substance and anyone who has access or 
influence to how those controlled substances are administered 
or stored.
    Ms. Kiggans. Mr. Bagdoyan, do you agree with that 
definition?
    Mr. Bagdoyan. That is my general understanding that it is 
correct to access, dispensation, influence, proximity. It does 
not have to be direct access based on my understanding, but 
that is generally accurate, yes.
    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you. Mr. Galik, are there VA employees 
who do not prescribe or dispense controlled substances but 
still have access to them according to the DEA's definition?
    Mr. Galik. Again, I am sorry, but I will have to defer to 
my colleague to respond to that.
    Ms. Bonjorni. Yes, there are employees who do not dispense 
or administer, and those would be reviewed on an individual 
basis at each facility based on their procedures. This new 
review, based on the feedback that we got from the GAO, is in 
our draft policy that we are working to roll out in January of 
this year to do the review that they recommended.
    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you. Mr. Bagdoyan, under what 
circumstances would a VA employee who has access to controlled 
substances need a DEA employment waiver?
    Mr. Bagdoyan. Yes, if they have a criminal history with a 
felony conviction for a controlled substance, and also, they do 
not have DEA registration, which would provide upfront sort of 
a dispensation that that was considered. Those would be the two 
principal triggers. Of course, access is----
    Ms. Kiggans. Right.
    Mr. Bagdoyan [continuing]. another issue as well, yes----
    Ms. Kiggans. Right.
    Mr. Bagdoyan [continuing]. or consideration, rather.
    Ms. Kiggans. Gotcha. Ms. Bonjorni, when was the last time 
the VA requested a DEA employment waiver?
    Ms. Bonjorni. We do not track that centrally under not 
having the policy in place yet that has been recommended. Under 
the new policy, any request for a waiver would have to come all 
the way up to central office, and so we would be able to track 
those centrally, and they would be reviewed at a national 
level.
    Ms. Kiggans. Okay. Just out of curiosity, what is the 
biggest problem with doing these background checks? We hear 
from other jobs that require background checks, and the length 
of time it takes to get them is one problem. What do you think 
the hindrance is? I think maybe, in my personal opinion, 
everyone should have a background check who is directly related 
to care for our veterans. What is the biggest problem with 
asking for and implementing background checks?
    Mr. Galik. I would say staffing is definitely a 
consideration, but all of our adjudicators who perform the 
adjudication of the background investigation results that come 
from DCSA are trained in accordance with the standards and 
criteria for how to conduct a background or how to assess the 
results of a background investigation. I think the VA, we are 
committed to performing those background investigations 
consistently and properly so that we have good workforce.
    These particular instances that have been noted in the 
reports do not really have a good explanation for how some of 
these occurred. We are trying to improve our oversight and 
compliance to track those and catch those instances where 
background investigations maybe were deficient or were not 
performed for whatever reason. I do not really have a good 
explanation as to why they occurred, but we are committed to 
ensuring that those types of events do not continue to occur in 
the future.
    Ms. Kiggans. Several of you mentioned just staffing 
challenges with tracking. What does the tracking process look 
like during that hiring process? People that require background 
checks, is there an electronic system? Is it a paper, or how 
are we actually charting who needs a background check, who has 
had one? Where they are in that process, is that adequate?
    Mr. Galik. Right. As highlighted, we have two primary 
systems right now, HR Smart, and also a new system, relatively 
new system, VA-CABS. We are moving toward VA-CABS being the one 
centralized system that captures all the data that is collected 
in the hiring process, the fingerprint results, the 
documentation that the application fills out related to the 
background investigation, also the results of the DCSA 
investigation. Right now, we do have some of that information 
in HR Smart, which is our HR primary system for employee 
tracking, but we are moving all of that here in early 2024 to 
one system, VA-CABS.
    Ms. Kiggans. Okay. Then, just out of curiosity, before I 
yield to Ranking Member Mrvan, what is the security like in 
your pharmacies? Are there cameras on all medications? Is there 
especially security cameras on things like the opioid 
distribution machines? I know different hospital systems are 
set up differently. Sometimes the staff has to scan a card 
before they can have access to the machines. For the medication 
to get in the machine, there are a lot of places where the 
medication has to get from where it is manufactured into the 
building, into the pharmacy, into the distribution machine. Is 
there adequate security? Are there cameras? Is there scanning 
of badges to know who comes in and out of the room and who has 
access to the machines? Or what does that security look like?
    Mr. Galik. I will ask my colleague to address that.
    Ms. Bonjorni. The detailed specifics are outside of my 
realm of expertise. My understanding is that, yes, there are 
requirements for scanning in and out whenever we are dispensing 
or administering any controlled substances. We have adequate 
control procedures in place with our pharmacy teams.
    Ms. Kiggans. Are there cameras installed?
    Ms. Bonjorni. I would have to get back to you on that.
    Ms. Kiggans. Just curious if that is a requirement or not. 
Great. Thank you so much. I yield to Ranking Member Mrvan.
    Mr. Mrvan. Thank you, Chairwoman. Mr. Bagdoyan, did the 
GAO's review of the VA's compliance with DEA policies and 
procedures include a review of the community care providers' 
compliance with the DEA policies? How can the VA ensure 
providers in the community who are reimbursed for caring for 
veterans are in compliance with DEA policies?
    Mr. Bagdoyan. Thank you for your question, Mr. Mrvan. That 
was not something that we focused on in our audit work leading 
to the report. The responsibility for seeking waivers, for 
example, for those providers, if appropriate, rests with their 
employers. With that in mind, VHA really does not have any 
influence on that process, at least that is my understanding. 
Our VHA colleagues may have a different take on it, but that is 
not something that we looked at.
    Mr. Mrvan. Okay. Mr. Galik, Chairman Kiggins asked a quick 
question, and you had answered that staffing is a consideration 
to one of the reasons why the process is not up to speed. Can 
you take a little deeper dive of what you mean as staffing as a 
consideration?
    Mr. Galik. Yes. Thank you for the question. Both department 
wide and also specifically VHA have put a good amount of time 
into assessing the workload and determining what are the 
appropriate grade levels and staffing levels that are necessary 
to support as we ramped up to support The Sergeant First Class 
Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive 
Toxics (PACT) Act and the hiring surge there over the more 
recent past. All this occurred around the COVID timeframe and 
we lost some momentum there in the 2020 timeframe.
    Basically, it is a staffing analysis. We did bring on some 
contractor support to do some work on assessing the workload, 
and what would be the appropriate grade levels and numbers of 
individuals required to support the workload. We just have not 
followed up yet and actually done the hiring to support the 
requirements that were identified.
    Mr. Mrvan. Thank you. Ms. Bonjorni, what policies and 
procedures are in place to ensure that community care providers 
are in compliance with the requirements of the Controlled 
Substance Act?
    Ms. Bonjorni. I would echo the comments of my GAO colleague 
that those would be the requirements of their employer. It is 
not something that we would administer in the human capital 
space in VHA.
    Mr. Mrvan. Right. The next level would that, does the VA 
verify from their employers that they are in compliance prior 
to allowing the veterans to go to a third party? Can you 
identify the loophole that we are trying to hone-in on?
    Ms. Bonjorni. Yes, I understand what you are asking. It 
is----
    Mr. Mrvan. Okay.
    Ms. Bonjorni [continuing]. that would be something that is 
required in the contracts that we have with our community care 
providers and the overall network, but outside of my portfolio.
    Mr. Mrvan. Okay. Can someone get us that answer?
    Ms. Bonjorni. Absolutely.
    Mr. Mrvan. Okay, thank you. My next question is, Mr. Galik, 
per VHA policy, the adjudicators have discretion in reviewing 
an onboarding employee's record and making a final suitability 
determination. In instances when a prospective employee has a 
criminal record, what information regarding that record do 
adjudicators take into account when making that sustainability 
determination, for example?
    Mr. Galik. Yes. All our adjudicators are formally trained 
in the criteria and standards that are established by the 
Office of Personnel Management. Includes factors such as 
criminal record, the debt commitment.
    Mr. Mrvan. Can I ask, does the length of time from the 
violation that it occurred, is that taken into account?
    Mr. Galik. Yes, that is taken into account. In terms of was 
it something that occurred perhaps a long time ago? If it was 
an employee, maybe something occurred with that individual 
where they were in the college environment and committed some 
type of activity or a crime like marijuana use or something 
along those----
    Mr. Mrvan. Is that policy on paper?
    Mr. Galik. In terms of the timeline? It is discussed----
    Mr. Mrvan. For the crime timeline consideration and the 
types of crime?
    Mr. Galik. Right. It is in the OPM guidelines----
    Mr. Mrvan. Okay.
    Mr. Galik [continuing]. and standards where that assists 
the adjudicator in making that call.
    Mr. Mrvan. How does this process take into account when 
state laws reclassify felony drug offenses as misdemeanors?
    Mr. Galik. I would have to get back to you on that one 
particular question, sir. I do know that dealing--we have to 
comply with the state laws in terms of those type of issues or 
they are taken into consideration. It becomes an area where the 
staff will need assistance from OGC, General Counsel and 
others, in making their ruling.
    Mr. Mrvan. Thank you. With that, I yield back.
    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you, Mr. Mrvan. Mrs. Radewagen, you are 
now recognized for 5 minutes for questioning.
    Ms. Radewagen. Thank you, Chairwoman Kiggans and Ranking 
Member Mrvan for holding this hearing today. Thank you to the 
witnesses for your testimony. Mr. Steele, your testimony 
highlighted steps VA should take to improve its background 
check program. Could you explain these steps?
    Mr. Steele. Yes, thank you. Our work identified gaps 
related to people, processes, and technology that support the 
personnel suitability program. We made numerous recommendations 
to establish robust oversight, commit staff to both oversight 
and operations at the headquarters level and in the field, and 
commit resources to ensuring that future systems support case 
management for the program.
    Ms. Radewagen. Mr. Steele, in your testimony, you also note 
how VA's information systems do not adequately support the 
background check program. Can you discuss this further? I mean, 
what is inadequate about VA's information systems?
    Mr. Steele. The IT systems were critical to the issues that 
we identified. As Mr. Galik noted in his testimony, VA relies 
on two systems, HR Smart and VA-CABS, to support the personnel 
suitability program and track the five key milestones that are 
associated with that process. While that is not prohibited, it 
is not ideal for case management and complicates the issue.
    We also identified some functionality issues with VA-CABS. 
For example, a field that was meant to collect the date when an 
investigation was scheduled with DCSA was meant to be auto 
populated. However, we found that in about one third of the 
cases that did not occur, and the process was able to move 
forward without that particular field being populated. We made 
recommendations for VA to consider closing those gaps, which we 
will monitor through our process.
    Ms. Radewagen. What can VA do to ensure its information 
systems adequately support VA's background check program moving 
forward?
    Mr. Steele. I can speak to the gaps that we identified 
during our audit, which were lack of functionality and the 
duality of the systems that impaired case management. In terms 
of the resources that VA needs to carry those out, I would have 
to defer those questions to VA.
    Ms. Radewagen. Mr. Galik, has VA made any improvements to 
its background check related information systems?
    Mr. Galik. Yes, that is very important to us. We are 
putting quite a bit of attention and effort into the new 
system, VA-CABS. We do have two systems at this time, HR Smart, 
to track the employee background investigation, and that data 
is moving, including making automated connections to move the 
data from HR Smart to VA-CABS. Working with our Chief 
Information Officer (CIO) information technology partners to 
address the requirements, whether it is provide the appropriate 
reports that can enable staff to perform their oversight role 
and also to improve the data quality so the data is accurate 
for each of the key milestones that enable us to track 
performance of those systems so the employees would feel that 
they are getting an effective tool to enable them to perform 
their job.
    Ms. Radewagen. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I yield back.
    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you, Mrs. Radewagen. Mr. Pappas, you are 
now recognized for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr. Pappas. Well, thank you very much, Madam Chair. I find 
the reports that we heard about from OIG and GAO deeply 
concerning. We are talking about a breakdown of basic 
governance, oversight, compliance that is potentially putting 
veterans at risk. Maybe I could start with you, Mr. Galik, and 
just ask if VA was surprised by these recommendations at all 
and if you can tell us any more about a timetable for when 
these recommendations will be satisfied and closed?
    Mr. Galik. Yes, thank you for the question. This is 
obviously the report findings and recommendations highlight a 
number of key issues. We kicked off a number of working groups 
and are putting together an overall oversight compliance plan 
that involved reinstituting the program reviews and onsite 
inspections or virtual inspections of each of the programs at 
each of the VA facilities. The timeline, it appears that most 
of the recommendations have moved a little bit to the right 
beyond the initial commitments, and we are working to complete 
most all of them in 2024, early calendar 2024.
    Mr. Pappas. Well, maybe if I can ask you about a comment I 
heard from Mr. Steele, I believe just talking about 
insufficient staff, which you have explored with some of the 
other members here through their questioning. He said that some 
of this work has been delegated down to the VISN level, but we 
also lack oversight in terms of what is happening at the VISN 
level. According to the OIG team, all five VISN personnel 
security chiefs that they interviewed did not consistently 
conduct reviews of the programs in their network.
    Oversight is basic. It is so essential, and we need to see 
more of it at VA at the VISN level. What are the plans to 
provide VISN security chiefs with the adequate support, 
staffing or otherwise, that they need to be able to conduct 
these reviews of the programs in their networks?
    Mr. Galik. I will ask my colleague to address that one for 
VHA.
    Ms. Bonjorni. Sure. Thank you for the question, 
Congressman. We were not surprised by the reports, as you asked 
about earlier, but it did put things into clear guidelines and 
pathways that we need to follow. Based on the recommendations 
that we received from OIG and GAO, we have developed a staffing 
model for personnel security functions in the field in VHA that 
we rolled out last month. That tool is now available for 
facilities to evaluate how well their staffing is doing.
    We did increase the total number of personnel security 
staff we have on board by about 35 percent over last year. We 
are making an improvement there. Then within our own office, we 
are adding additional personnel to perform those compliance and 
oversight duties and reinstitute the onsite personnel security 
reviews starting in 2024 once we fill our positions. We are 
taking all of their advice very, very seriously.
    Mr. Pappas. Well, thank you for that. Another question. As 
part of the Cleland-Dole Act that was signed into law last 
year, we enacted provisions that require VA to improve its 
credentialing processes to include ensuring covered healthcare 
professionals hold active DEA registrations. It also required 
VA to audit Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMCs) 
annually to check compliance. The first reports are due to 
Congress at the end of this year, and I am wondering if you can 
tell us when we expect to receive those reports and if you have 
any sort of a preview on that.
    Mr. Galik. I will ask my colleague to address that.
    Ms. Bonjorni. Credentialing is another area that is not in 
my portfolio, but we will be happy to get back for you on the 
timeline for that.
    Mr. Pappas. Okay. Well, thank you for that. With that, I 
will yield back. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you, Mr. Pappas. Mr. Bergman, you are 
now recognized for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr. Bergman. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Let us get right 
to it. Mr. Steele, when did OIG first find deficiencies in VA's 
background check process?
    Mr. Steele. The OIG became alert to potential issues in the 
background process when a whistleblower identified a backlog of 
cases at the Atlanta VA Medical Center. We substantiated those 
issues in a January 2017 report, but it was clear that we 
needed to conduct a nationwide review of the program. Our March 
2018 audit identified gaps related to insufficient staffing, 
inadequate processes, and inadequate IT systems. We made 
numerous recommendations to VA at that time for corrective 
action.
    Mr. Bergman. Okay. 2017 identified through a whistleblower. 
You did your due diligence, issued a report. Are these 
deficiencies similar to those the OIG described in its 
September 2023 report?
    Mr. Steele. Yes. VA has, in between our two reports, 
implemented new advisories and policies. They introduced VA-
CABS between our 2018 report and 2023, but the underlying 
issues remain the same. There are still gaps related to people, 
processes, and technology that need to be closed.
    Mr. Bergman. If we are identifying the same things over and 
again, why or what has not allowed--what has been inhibiting VA 
from making significant progress in fixing the deficiencies?
    Mr. Steele. The personnel suitability program is a people-
driven process, and I think the theme as we have----
    Mr. Bergman. Define people driven process in this case.
    Mr. Steele. There is workload that needs to be completed 
and a need for people to be dedicated to carrying----
    Mr. Bergman. Okay.
    Mr. Steele [continuing]. out those tasks.
    Mr. Bergman. You have got a workload that is not matched 
with the humans, the number of humans' ability to really get 
into that workload. Are you saying you need more people?
    Mr. Steele. That is correct.
    Mr. Bergman. Okay. Do you need them full-time or do we just 
work off the backlog? Are there any folks that VA could 
contract with to bring in qualified, for lack of a better term, 
investigators, adjudicators, whatever you want to call it, to 
bring down the backlog? I see you shaking your head. The answer 
is no. Why not? Whether it be the governmental sector or the 
private sector, there are expertises that exist that if your 
goal is to knock down a backlog or decrease the time without 
adding unnecessarily full-time equivalents, because if you add 
full-time equivalents now, you have got someone on the payroll. 
If you knock it down, do they have work to do? Okay. Tell me, 
you were shaking your head. Why is it the way it is?
    Ms. Bonjorni. Adjudicators are one of those inherently 
governmental functions that cannot be contracted out to a 
contractor.
    Mr. Bergman. By law, by policy, or by capability?
    Ms. Bonjorni. I believe by law and OPM requirements.
    Mr. Bergman. It is not as though it cannot be done by 
changing the requirements and the law, it is just that it is 
being used as a reason to not do it because it is the law, it 
is the policy. Am I hearing you correctly?
    Ms. Bonjorni. Yes. I would add that it is because we are 
asking them to make a decision about whether someone is 
suitable for Federal employment. That is not typically 
something we would want to outsource outside the government.
    Mr. Bergman. Want to or need to? What do we sacrifice by 
delaying? Do we sacrifice the ability of our good people who 
are trying to do the job and do it right and get others in? Who 
fails in the end? Where does the burden of lack of performance, 
lack of the ability to get it down? Who does that lie with? 
Does that lie with the bureaucracy? Does that lie with who? The 
policymakers like us? Who should we pin the rose on?
    Ms. Bonjorni. Right now, you can continue to pin it on the 
VA because we need to be making more improvements swiftly to 
staff, which is what we are doing right now. We are staffing up 
those positions to make sure that we can address backlogs and 
issues.
    Mr. Bergman. Some of us who have been to the war fight, 
when you are in the fight, you are really not worried about 
policy. You are worried about what have you got for ammunition 
and what have you got for support? I would suggest we could all 
improve. We want to work with you, but how do we take, do the 
right thing long term, but do something in the short term that 
actually benefits the veterans through good adjudication, then 
hiring, and all of that? With that, Madam Chair, I yield back.
    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you very much. Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick, 
you are now recognized for 5 minutes for questions.
    Ms. Cherfilus-McCormick. Thank you, Madam Chair. I wanted 
to kind of circle back to one of the initial conversations you 
were having with Ranking Member Mrvan. I wanted to know what is 
your oversight mechanisms to ensure that the community care 
providers are living up to their contractual obligations? Now, 
Mr. Steele mentioned real quick the audit process, I just want 
to dive a little deeper into that.
    Mr. Galik. I will ask my colleague if she could address 
that.
    Ms. Bonjorni. I will continue to need to get back to you. 
Community care is outside of my area of expertise.
    Ms. Cherfilus-McCormick. What is the audit process or 
oversight process you have? One of my concerns is, before I 
came to Congress, I worked 15 years as a Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO) of a healthcare company. One of our preliminary 
things that we did, we had an audit process to make sure we 
were living up to our contractual obligations. Compliance was 
always the first lever. Those who gave us the contract, they 
actually had a mechanism in place even before you can get paid. 
That has been the priority that I have seen, the standard. I 
wanted to know what was yours, because I think that is really 
going to be one of the linchpins in figuring out how to solve 
this long term and short term. I would love to get that 
information back, because I think that is where we are really 
finding the problem.
    I heard a lot about the policies, procedures. Policies and 
procedures and reports are wonderful, but we are really looking 
at the implementation plan so we can protect our veterans. Is 
there any implementation plans that you could talk about today 
that will assist us in protecting our veterans?
    Ms. Bonjorni. As it relates to community care providers or 
our employees?
    Ms. Cherfilus-McCormick. Employees, community care 
providers. I am really looking into the background checks, the 
lapse of those people who were able to work without those 
background checks.
    Ms. Bonjorni. Oh, as it relates to background 
investigations for our employees, I could speak to what we are 
doing internally to VHA. As mentioned, we are increasing our 
staffing to try to tackle those issues to make sure we do not 
end up with situations as Mr. Steele referenced before, where 
we had just one person onsite to adjudicate background 
investigations. We have to make sure that we have multiple 
people there for checks and balances. We have instituted that 
already across the system.
    We are also instituting a compliance checklist that we are 
piloting in two networks right now based on some of the 
recommendations we got from our partners here on the dais that 
we are going to roll out throughout the system in March 2024.
    Ms. Cherfilus-McCormick. The proficiency of the things that 
you are implementing right now, are you confident that they are 
actually going to solve this problem, that we will not be going 
into 2024 finding the lapse of background checks?
    Ms. Bonjorni. Yes. I think that we are finally identifying 
the things that we really need to tackle with the help of the 
technology improvements that we are seeing.
    Ms. Cherfilus-McCormick. My next question, it is really 
about the hiring. We looked, and we see that throughout the 
entire spectrum of healthcare, there is a shortage of getting 
qualified nurses, nurse practitioners into the system. When I 
visited VAs from in my State of Florida and also in Texas, they 
all complained about the lag time. They are extremely long. We 
heard from our stakeholders during the hearing also that we had 
that employee hiring process times at the VA often can run as 
long as 6 months. By contrast, effectively run private 
hospitals typically turned around the same level of paperwork 
no longer than 4 weeks.
    In addition to that, when we spoke to healthcare providers, 
they said they would love to work for the VA. However, the long 
time of waiting made it unacceptable for them because they had 
to take another job. What steps are you taking to actually cut 
it down? I am aware of the problems that we are having with our 
technology modernization as the ranking member, so I wanted to 
know what we can do on that front also to cut down those times?
    Ms. Bonjorni. Sure, I could speak to the hiring process 
improvements. Our team is charged with tackling that. It 
remains a priority for our leadership. Right now, we are doing 
a lot of different things in 2024, looking at sharing best 
practices across the system. We look at each of our locations 
that have done one step in the process really, really well. We 
are trying to take what they have learned at that site and 
share it across the system to improve time to hire.
    Ms. Cherfilus-McCormick. In that process--I do not mean 
interrupt you--it looks like you are looking at best practices. 
When you are looking at best practices in hiring, what has been 
the average rate, timeframe? You are going from not 6 months 
now, the ones that who have the best practices, what is that 
timeline like?
    Ms. Bonjorni. It is still longer than the community. In the 
places where we are doing the best, we have locations where 
they have time to fill in the range of 90 days. That is still 
much better than our average, which is 168 days for time to 
fill in VHA.
    Ms. Cherfilus-McCormick. What do you think is an acceptable 
timeframe in this area that we are in where it is so hard to 
get healthcare professionals, what is the goal timeframe that 
you would like to see the VA in hiring?
    Ms. Bonjorni. Our goal, in conjunction with OPM, is 80 days 
for hires. I still think that is too long. We would love to get 
closer to 60 days or less.
    Ms. Cherfilus-McCormick. Thank you. I yield back.
    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you so much. Mr. Rosendale, you are now 
recognized for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr. Rosendale. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and thank 
you very much, Madam Chair, for holding this hearing. The U.S. 
Department of Veteran Affairs is required to have individuals 
to go through an extensive background check before being hired 
to protect veterans, veterans' family members, and fellow VA 
employees. Any employee of the VA must properly be vetted to 
ensure that our veterans receive the best possible care.
    VA's personnel suitability program governs the background 
check process and is designed to ensure individuals hired to 
care for veterans or handle veterans' sensitive information are 
suited for those responsibilities. The Office of the Inspector 
General and the Government Accountability Office have both 
released reports that found the VA violates its own policies by 
allowing individuals to obtain employment without completed 
background checks. This is unacceptable, and I appreciate the 
committee's effort to search for those answers.
    More closer to home, we had these problems arising at the 
Fort Harrison medical facility in Montana. It was so, so 
terrible and egregious that after an investigation was 
conducted, we most recently had been able to have the director 
removed from that facility. That is what we call accountability 
in Montana.
    I am tired of representatives from the Veterans 
Administration sitting here and telling us, I take fully 
responsibility for these actions and the things that are going 
on, but they continue in their same positions with their same 
compensation, and that is not taking responsibility.
    More recently, I want to ask about human resources failure 
by the VA. This is to Ms. Bonjorni. I cosigned a letter by 
Congressman Luttrell regarding Shekeba Morrad, an attorney at 
the VA who shared a video where she was antisemitic and mocked 
hostages. The VA was supposed to have provided a response by 
last night and has not done so. What is the VA's response to 
this disturbing video?
    Ms. Bonjorni. Thank you for raising that issue. It has 
absolutely been brought to the attention of leaders throughout 
the organization. We have had extensive conversations about the 
importance of educating employees on appropriate social media 
use.
    Mr. Rosendale. Brought to the attention, and we have had 
conversations about educating them. Okay.
    Ms. Bonjorni. Yes, but----
    Mr. Rosendale. If anyone in this dais had conducted 
themselves in the way that Ms. Morrad did, they would be 
calling for an expulsion on the House floor right now. The 
action took place on November 12. The letter was sent out on 
November 30, so this was not like 72 hours. The letter for 
request of information was sent out on November 30. We have had 
3-1/2 weeks since the act. What action has been taken place 
except to identify that, yes, we do have a problem?
    Ms. Bonjorni. To my knowledge, it is an ongoing 
investigation without final decision.
    Mr. Rosendale. Is Ms. Morrad still receiving compensation 
and sitting in her regular duties?
    Ms. Bonjorni. I would have to get back to you on that.
    Mr. Rosendale. I would like to know that, because that is 
very problematic for someone who released an antisemitic video 
that was posted on November 12. Ms. Morrad actively mocked the 
Israeli hostages being held captive by Hamas.
    As you were well aware, on October 7 of this year, Hamas 
committed one of the vilest terrorist attacks in recent 
history. I am taking this directly from the letter. During the 
attack, men, women, and children, and children that Hamas did 
not kill, were taken back to Gaza to be held as hostages. Ms. 
Morrad's mocking of these people and their families is 
unacceptable and quite frankly, dangerous to the other staff 
and dangerous to the actions that are taking place in the 
facility. I find it troubling that you would sit there and say 
that we have identified that issue, but yet you have no 
understanding of where Ms. Morrad is, if she is being 
compensated, and what has taken place.
    This letter went out on November 30, and so I would say by 
close of business today, I would like to have some kind of 
information about her status as it exists right now and what 
actions are being taken as we move forward. I yield back. Thank 
you very much, Madam Chair.
    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you, Mr. Rosendale. I want to proceed to 
just a second round of questions and getting back to some of 
the issues with background checks and whatnot. Mr. Steele, is 
it possible that some of the VA employees with felony drug 
convictions have never received a background check?
    Mr. Steele. Well, I cannot speak to that element of the 
background check process. Our report did identify gaps related 
to people, processes, and technology that suggests that VA does 
not consistently complete suitability actions timely or at all. 
In terms of the specific DEA waiver process, I would have to 
defer that to VA.
    Ms. Kiggans. It is possible that there are people with 
felony drug convictions that have not received a background 
check working at the VA?
    Mr. Steele. There are gaps in the background check process 
that do not ensure that they are completed.
    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you. Mr. Bagdoyan, does the VA have a 
policy in place to determine whether an employee has access to 
controlled substances?
    Mr. Bagdoyan. Policy for access, I am not sure, I know they 
do not have one for waivers. I would redirect to the VA if they 
do. Apologies for not knowing that off the top of my head.
    Ms. Kiggans. Would it be possible, do you think, for and 
maybe, Ms. Bonjorni, you would be better suited to answer the 
question, but for someone like a maintenance staff or cleaning 
staff that might have access to controlled substances?
    Ms. Bonjorni. Maintenance staff or cleaning staff would not 
have access to controlled substances. However, in the draft 
policy that we are planning to move forward with in January, we 
are going to be issuing guidance to facilities as well to 
evaluate each position so they are able to understand how to 
make that designation of which positions have access or do not. 
A maintenance worker would not have access.
    Ms. Kiggans. In this report that will come out then in 
January, this policy, will security be addressed in that as 
well so there will be ways to track? I feel like that is 
another just step of good deterrence for when people know that 
they are being watched and on camera.
    Ms. Bonjorni. That would be covered under other policies 
about how we administer and manage controlled substances. The 
one that we are putting forward is an HR policy.
    Ms. Kiggans. Okay. Great. We will follow up on that. Mr. 
Bagdoyan, in your testimony, you note the risk that the VA is 
taking by not having this policy. Could you talk about the 
risks of not having just a policy in place to determine whether 
an employee has access or not?
    Mr. Bagdoyan. Sure, yes. As I highlighted in my opening 
remarks, it is the care or the attention that a veteran needs 
when in facility and also, of course, the diversion risk. As 
reported to DEA in 2021 there were 50 instances within VHA 
where there was employee theft involved. I am not certain 
whether that involved also diversion for illegal purposes.
    You know, if you go by a standard of one is one too many, 
it is close to an absolute standard. Given that veterans are 
involved, that may be something to really take a close look at 
in terms of how certain do you have to be through processes and 
procedures to make sure that these potentially unsuitable 
employees do not have access and then harm veterans or engage 
in other illegal activities.
    Ms. Kiggans. Can any of you answer just this question? When 
you do find in a VA facility that there has been people that 
there are controlled substances that are missing, there are 
people there that are involved in maybe some nefarious 
activities, what is the process done then? Is there a procedure 
in place that they come in and they take a closer look at each 
employee that has access to those controlled substances? What 
are we doing to actually rectify that problem once it is 
highlighted?
    Ms. Bonjorni. Yes, so, our facilities do have standard 
procedures to do investigations. When there is an issue 
identified of potential loss or diversion of controlled 
substances, those procedures are standard and in place.
    Ms. Kiggans. They happen every time?
    Ms. Bonjorni. Yes.
    Ms. Kiggans. Okay. Mr. Bagdoyan, when did the GAO first 
recommend that the VA develop a policy?
    Mr. Bagdoyan. For waivers, yes. That goes back to our 2019 
report that we issued. The audit work for that actually went 
back as far as 2015. That is something that we flagged quite a 
while ago. Of course, our 2023 report found similar challenges 
with the absence of a waiver policy, which is the anchor in 
terms of, or the roadmap, if you will, of what needs to be 
done. Further to Mr. Steele's point of people, processes, and 
technology, you will not know what you need unless you have a 
policy to anchor all those activities on.
    Ms. Kiggans. It has been a while, several years----
    Mr. Bagdoyan. Yes, ma'am.
    Ms. Kiggans [continuing]. and multiple occasions----
    Mr. Bagdoyan. Yes.
    Ms. Kiggans [continuing]. that you have asked for that.
    Mr. Bagdoyan. Eight years and counting, yes.
    Ms. Kiggans. Okay. Ms. Bonjorni, why has it taken so long 
for the VA to create this policy?
    Ms. Bonjorni. My understanding is that our group who was 
looking at developing the policy had extensive discussions with 
the DEA to make sure that we understood what their requirements 
were until we got to a point where we feel we understand 
exactly what they are looking for and we can publish a policy. 
It has been drafted now for a few months, and we are getting 
ready to issue it.
    Ms. Kiggans. January we will receive a policy or we can 
find it----
    Ms. Bonjorni. An interim policy will come out in January, 
yes.
    Ms. Kiggans. Okay, great.
    Ms. Bonjorni. That facilities can start making sure they 
are doing the appropriate reviews.
    Ms. Kiggans. I am looking forward to reviewing that. Will 
the policy include the DEA's definition of access to controlled 
substances?
    Ms. Bonjorni. Yes, it will.
    Ms. Kiggans. Great. Last question, Mr. Bagdoyan, will you 
be reviewing the VA's policy when they publish it?
    Mr. Bagdoyan. Yes, that is part of our recommendation 
monitoring process. We engage regularly with VA and other 
agency personnel as they implement our recommendations, of 
course, within the boundaries of independence on both sides. 
Yes, we look forward to seeing that as evidence so that we 
consider closing the recommendation and giving the department 
credit for taking action. I would point out that it has to be 
action in fact, in addition to action on paper. Those are two 
different things.
    Ms. Kiggans. Right.
    Mr. Bagdoyan. I just want to make a note of that.
    Ms. Kiggans. We too in this committee will be anxiously 
looking forward to reviewing the policy and following up on its 
implementation. Thank you very much for that, and I yield to 
Ranking Member Mrvan.
    Mr. Mrvan. Mr. Steele, in your audit of the VA's personnel 
suitability program, you determine that staffing is a core 
deficiency leading to the issues with how the personnel 
suitability program operates or fails to operate effectively. 
In your audit, you identified examples of human capital 
concerns throughout the personnel suitability process. For 
instance, there is a single VISN adjudicator to address 
thousands of employee onboarding files at a number of 
facilities. In your view, how many employees are needed to fill 
the need to onboard on time to get to the goals that Mrs. 
Bonjorni talked about?
    Mr. Steele. Our audit identified clearly that personnel 
suitability actions were not being completed timely or at all, 
and that could be attributed to a lack of staffing. We did not 
evaluate staffing metrics or other benchmarks that would guide 
that. VA did provide us a draft staffing model that we 
highlighted in our report. However, we made a recommendation 
that we will follow up on to see where they eventually end up 
with that metric. In terms of specific questions related to 
staffing levels, I would have to defer to VA.
    Mr. Mrvan. Okay. Ms. Bonjorni, as far as that staffing 
model, can you elaborate on what that looked like?
    Ms. Bonjorni. Sure. The staffing model that we recently 
rolled out for facility use includes recommendations around 
total staffing for both personnel security specialists and 
personnel security assistants who participate in this entire 
process in the HR realm. Right now, we have about 800 total on 
board between those two occupational groups, and we estimate 
that we still have a gap of about 145 total that still need to 
be hired to get to full capacity.
    Mr. Mrvan. Okay. Mr. Steele, we heard from the VA that they 
have made progress in implementing the new case management IT 
system for personnel suitability deemed the VA-CABS 2.0. Has 
the IG had a chance to review this updated system? What 
features would an updated case management IT system ideally 
have to help the VA effectively manage its personnel 
suitability program?
    Mr. Steele. We made recommendations related to the new VA-
CABS 2.0 system. However, our first follow up to those 
recommendations will not occur until later this month. We have 
not reviewed anything related to how VA has defined their 
requirements for that new system.
    Mr. Mrvan. Okay. With that, I yield back, chairwoman.
    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you, Mr. Mrvan. The chair now recognizes 
Mr. Rosendale for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr. Rosendale. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. You did a 
really good job of outlining the process that is deficient and 
trying to establish a new one going forward. I appreciate that. 
That wiped out a bunch of my questions. It sounds to me just 
what I am hearing here is that the focus needs to be on the 
actual onboarding of the employees, that joining the VA is not 
the origins of these people having different drug problems, 
Okay? They had these problems with substance abuse and/or the 
felonies prior to joining the VA. We really need to be drilling 
down on the onboarding process, the hiring process, to make 
sure that we are not bringing these people that already have 
problems into a system that might provide them with the means 
to access the substances that are giving them problems in their 
lives to begin with. Mr. Bagdoyan, am I pronouncing that 
correctly?
    Mr. Bagdoyan. Yes, sir, thank you.
    Mr. Rosendale. Bagdoyan, yes, sir. VA testified that it has 
been years since the last submitted a DEA employment waiver. Do 
you think the department was properly following Federal laws 
and regulations by doing so?
    Mr. Bagdoyan. Well, Mr. Rosendale, if they do not have a 
policy which I identified as the anchor of what VA should be 
doing, I do not want to speculate on whether they violated 
something or not, but it clearly is a gap that should be 
closed. As Ms. Bonjorni indicated----
    Mr. Rosendale. If they were not violating something, they 
certainly were not following the intent of what DEA was trying 
to do, then can we say that?
    Mr. Bagdoyan. I would say that in the case of the 50 people 
we identified in our projectable sample, the determinations 
that these individuals, at least for 48 of them, that VA 
confirmed that they did not need a waiver for one reason or 
another. That was kind of an ad hoc decision, if you will, that 
was not----
    Mr. Rosendale. Yes. So, again----
    Mr. Bagdoyan [continuing]. grounded in policy----
    Mr. Rosendale [continuing]. the waiver was not necessary. 
However, they had previous problems that had not been detected. 
Again, this is where we go to the onboarding. If somebody has a 
problem, I mean, are we going to take a kleptomaniac and leave 
them in charge of security of the store? I do not think so, 
okay. Do not expose them.
    Ms. Bonjorni, I hope that you are now clear on DEA's 
guidance. How many current VA employees require employment 
waivers but do not have them?
    Ms. Bonjorni. That is one of the things that we will be 
reviewing when we roll this policy out.
    Mr. Rosendale. Do we have any kind of estimate whatsoever? 
Is this some numbers that you can provide to us within the next 
week?
    Ms. Bonjorni. When we do the review, so when we roll out 
the draft policy as well as the guidance for facilities about 
how to do the review, we will be able to provide you additional 
information on that.
    Mr. Rosendale. Okay. Ms. Bonjorni, in 2021, VA accounted 
for 7 percent of DEA's total reports of theft or loss of 
controlled substances. Have any of these incidents involved 
employees with a criminal record?
    Ms. Bonjorni. I would need to get back to you on that.
    Mr. Rosendale. Okay. Again, I am drilling down, trying to 
get to the point that what we need to be focusing on is the 
preemployment. We have to be focused on the onboarding of these 
employees so that we are not putting people in a position where 
they can be a danger to themselves and others. Do you think 
that having a controlled substance policy that complies with 
DEA regulations could help reduce those numbers?
    Ms. Bonjorni. I do think it could help, but I would offer 
that right now, we are following the personnel suitability 
requirements that are in place already from OPM. We also are 
reviewing to make sure that people have appropriate 
unrestricted licenses. Any type of felony conviction would tend 
to have some kind of impact on licensure already. That is 
reviewed in the credentialing process as well.
    Mr. Rosendale. Okay. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would yield 
back the balance of my time.
    Ms. Kiggans. Thank you, Mr. Rosendale. I just want to thank 
our committee members and especially those of you who came to 
testify before us today. Thank you very much. I know there is 
work to be done. It was very educational for me and I am sure 
the other members to hear of the good work that you all are 
doing.
    I feel like the opioid crisis is a crisis, right? We are 
working to just make positive changes in all facets of it. I 
feel like we have done a good job. The DEA works hard with 
providers. As a nurse practitioner, I know that we have a drug 
data base. We are careful about our prescribing habits. I think 
that the VA does a good job of ensuring patient safety through 
things like drug contracts and drug screenings and just really 
watching how we are prescribing opioids.
    This is kind of the back end of that loop. Just curtailing 
that, again, nefarious activity. We have made it harder to get 
opioids, which is a good thing.
    We need to close the loop on the back end to make sure that 
we are--the employees that we are hiring, not just for patient 
safety, but cost too. I mean, there are costs associated with 
that type of theft. Making sure we are doing all of the right 
things to provide the best care for our veterans. Thank you for 
all the good work you are doing. Thank you to our members. I 
ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days 
in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any 
extraneous material. Hearing no objection, so ordered. This 
hearing is now adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:17 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

                   Prepared Statement of Daniel Galik

    Good afternoon, Chairwoman Kiggans, Ranking Member Mrvan and 
Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss 
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Human Resources (HR) and 
Background Investigation processes. I am accompanied today by Jessica 
Bonjorni, Chief, Human Capital Management, Veterans Health 
Administration (VHA).
    VA recognizes that rigorous personnel security and suitability 
protocols for its health care workforce are vital to maintaining the 
trust of Veterans, Veteran families, and VA employees in its health 
care delivery system. VA's background investigation processes for all 
employees aligns with 5 C.F.R. Part 731 and guidelines established by 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

Suitability Processes

    Pre-employment screening for Federal employees to determine 
suitability for employment generally begins once a tentative job offer 
is made. At this stage, self-declared information and available 
criminal history are reviewed. Once an applicant has a favorable 
screening, a background investigation is initiated at the appropriate 
level for the position.
    Suitability determinations involve a review of the person's 
character or conduct that may have an impact on the integrity or 
efficiency of the service. Once a completed background investigation is 
sent from Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) to VA 
and a trained suitability adjudicator makes a final determination. This 
determination considers whether the individual has the appropriate 
character and conduct for Federal employment in the position sought.
    The Office of Human Resources and Administration/Operations, 
Security and Preparedness (HRA/OSP) sets VA enterprise policy and has 
oversight over background investigations processed for VA employees. VA 
Administrations (VHA, Veterans Benefits Administration and National 
Cemetery Administration) are responsible for following VA policy when 
processing background investigations to ensure the safety of Veterans, 
employees and visitors. Achievement of the investigative requirements 
is verified during VA information technology account provisioning and 
Personal Identity Verification badge issuance.
    Background investigations for Federal employees should be initiated 
before appointment but no later than 14 calendar days after placement 
in the position. VA uses the same standard for contractors. A final 
suitability decision is made after the conclusion of the background 
investigation by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency 
(DCSA) and in accordance with 5 C.F.R. part 731, must be reported to 
the governmentwide reciprocity system no later than 90 days after the 
investigation is completed.
    Issues discovered during the pre-employment screening process are 
forwarded to a trained adjudicator for review and appropriate action. 
If the adjudicator cannot mitigate the issues found during the pre-
employment screening process, the VA HR Onboarding Point-of-Contact 
(POC) may decide to withdraw the offer.
    Qualification issues, to include U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) registration, are also identified by VA's 
credentialing POC and communicated to the HR POC to determine the 
appropriate follow-up action.
    Similarly, issues discovered during the background investigation 
process are forwarded to a trained adjudicator for review and 
appropriate action \1\. If the adjudicator cannot mitigate the 
identified issues, a decision of unsuitable may be rendered. The 
adjudicator will determine if a suitability action or action under 
another applicable authority may be appropriate. The decision on which 
authority may be applied may take into account the length of time on 
the job and the seriousness of the issues.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    When issues are discovered after a person is hired, such as when an 
alert is received by VA from DCSA Continuous Vetting products updated 
criminal history information), these alerts are reviewed by a trained 
adjudicator \2\. As appropriate, Employee Relations and Labor Relations 
may initiate appropriate adverse action on employees. In response to 
GAO Audit (#23-104296) VA, under HRA/OSP guidance, developed a RAP BACK 
action plan that includes development of control procedures and any 
other action that must be completed to ensure RAP BACK notifications 
are routed and resolved appropriately.

Efforts to improve VA's Personnel Security and Suitability Program

    In late 2020, VA established working groups and Integrated Project 
Teams (IPT) to review the processes used within VA to initiate 
background investigations and the subsequent adjudication by VA staff 
of those investigations. The IPTs identified process enhancements that 
were implemented to mitigate weaknesses and inconsistencies in how 
background investigations were adjudicated by VA's adjudicators. The 
findings from the Fiscal Year 2022 Federal Information Security 
Management Act (FISMA) audit determined that VA has made and continues 
to make progress, and continued focus is needed to processing address 
the improvements identified in the audit. VA is continuing to update 
our corrective action plans to resolve issues identified in the FISMA 
audit reports.
    VA is also addressing how to improve governance of the personnel 
suitability program as identified in VA Office of Inspector General 
(OIG) Audit Report 21-03718-189, dated September 21, 2023. HRA/OSP is 
leading the development of a VA-wide plan with actions and milestones 
to increase oversight of VA's personnel security and suitability 
program, identify roles and responsibilities, review and update 
oversight processes as well as verify that background investigations 
are initiated and adjudicated within prescribed timelines and that 
documentation is filed as required. VHA completed a personnel security 
oversight and compliance pilot on October 31, 2023, to test guidelines 
and job aids to enhance VHA Personnel Security programs. Those 
guidelines and job aids are being refined for deployment across VHA 
through March 2024. This more structured approach to oversight and 
compliance will be supported through a new Personnel Security staffing 
model recently published for Veterans Integrated Service Networks and 
other VHA offices to implement.
    In partnership with HRA/OSP, the Administrations will also develop 
plans to establish robust oversight of their personnel suitability 
programs. HRA/OSP will integrate these plans into the VA-wide plan. The 
plan will include the actions and resources required by HRA/OSP and the 
Administrations to reimplement the monitoring program required by VA 
Handbook 0710 on the personnel vetting program. It will also identify, 
prevent, and mitigate any systemic areas of improvement in the 
personnel suitability program. The plan will be submitted to OIG by 
December 31, 2023.

VA's Rehabilitation Program

    VA emphasizes the importance of finding a balance in our mission to 
provide world-class health care to Veterans and our mission to support 
the rehabilitation of Veterans who have had complex histories including 
substance abuse. For example, VA's Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) 
program is a clinical vocational rehabilitation program offered at 
every VA medical center. CWT provides Veterans with evidence-based 
vocational rehabilitation services. These services include partnerships 
with business, industry and Government agencies to provide Veteran 
candidates with employment.
    To be considered for participation in the CWT program, a Veteran 
must be eligible to receive VA health care services, have a goal of 
returning to competitive employment and have experienced barriers to 
obtaining and/or retaining employment, which requires the intensive 
supports provided by one of the CWT service components. There are 
numerous success stories of the CWT program, including Veterans who 
graduated from VA's CWT program to become full-time employees at VA 
medical centers or as cemetery caretakers, and employers have realized 
the benefits of hiring Veterans from the program.
    VA seeks to hire Veterans who have rehabilitated on their own or 
through structured VA programs, including the 52,000 Veterans VA serves 
annually through the CWT program. Enhancing Veteran readiness for re-
employment and successful reintegration back into the workforce 
balances VHA care delivery with our mission to rehabilitate Veterans, 
including those with histories of substance use, or prior criminal 
history. In the event a CWT program participant is offered employment 
at VA at the conclusion of their therapy, these Veterans are subject to 
the same suitability requirements as other VA employees.

Conclusion

    Madam Chair and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the 
opportunity to share more information on VA's background investigation 
and HR processes and how VA helps protect Veterans. Our objective is to 
give the Nation's Veterans the top-quality care they have earned and 
deserve by carefully and thoroughly vetting all personnel who will 
interact with Veterans, their families, and others at VA. We appreciate 
this Subcommittee's continued support and encouragement.
    This concludes my testimony. Ms. Bonjorni and I are prepared to 
respond to any questions you may have.
