                        THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
                 Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:00 a.m., in 
Room SD-366, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Joe Manchin 
III, Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

    The Chairman. The Committee will come to order.
    Before I turn to my opening statement about our hearing 
today, let me begin by noting that if we get a quorum of seven 
members, we are going to take a moment to adopt the resolution 
appointing members of our subcommittees.
    And now today, we will be discussing the steps needed to 
address cybersecurity threats to the United States' energy 
infrastructure. In addition to energy resources that are being 
used as a geopolitical weapon against our friends and allies, 
our adversaries have increasingly begun using cyberattacks to 
infiltrate American infrastructure to disrupt our energy 
security and economy.
    The rapidly changing cyber threat landscape will require 
constant federal attention and strategic flexibility to ensure 
that we are ahead of the curve and not caught off guard to the 
detriment of our national security, public health and safety, 
and our economy. Our government has taken substantial steps in 
the past decade to improve federal coordination, increase 
funding for research and development, enhance intelligent 
dissemination, and build on existing public-private 
partnerships.
    I want to thank our witnesses for joining us today to 
contribute to this important discussion and provide input on 
additional actions Congress needs to take to strengthen our 
energy cybersecurity strategy. Cyber threats can be attributed 
to individual bad actors, transnational organized crime, state-
sponsored groups, and nations themselves. The 2022 annual 
threat assessment from the Office of the Director of National 
Intelligence assessed China as the broadest and most active 
cyber threat to the U.S. Government and private-sector 
networks. In addition, the assessment identifies Russia as the 
top cyber threat that is specifically focused on targeting our 
critical infrastructure. Russia's cyberattack that shut down 
Ukraine's electricity grid in 2015 was a wake-up call to the 
possibility of large-scale cyberattacks on critical 
infrastructure like our electric grid. Putin's vicious 
aggression in Ukraine increased the likelihood that Russia will 
increasingly rely on extreme dangerous tactics against 
Ukraine's allies, such as using cyberattacks as retaliation for 
sending arms and aid to the Ukrainians.
    Domestically, our relevant agencies and industries have 
been on heightened alert. Cyber incidents impacting our 
domestic energy infrastructure pose a persistent threat, many 
of which we never even hear about. However, some attacks have 
highlighted the severity of attacks directed to our energy 
infrastructure. In 2021, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware 
attack forced the shutdown of the country's most important fuel 
pipeline for nearly a week. Colonial delivers nearly half of 
the gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel to the East Coast, over 100 
million gallons per day. The Department of Energy provided a 
stark assessment--if the pipeline had been down for a few more 
days, it would have resulted in diesel rationing, and chemical 
and refinery operations would have been suspended due to an 
inability to transport their production. Just last year, the 
Department of Justice charged four Russian government officials 
who used cyberattacks to target critical infrastructure and 
companies from 2012 to 2018. They breached hundreds of energy 
companies worldwide, including a nuclear power plant in Kansas, 
intending to disrupt our global energy system.
    Moreover, there have been numerous reports of attempted 
cyberattacks on the U.S. electric grid and natural gas sites. 
Our energy system is rapidly evolving. Our aging grid is not 
designed to protect itself from modern cyberattacks and is 
transforming into a new network-connected environment. In 
addition to the electric grid, pipeline networks are becoming 
more dependent on internet-based control systems for their 
operations. As we improve our energy systems with remote and 
automated capabilities intended to make energy more reliable, 
this new connectivity raises the stakes for security 
intrusions.
    We must also consider the new distributed energy resources 
connected to our grid. Americans are purchasing rooftop solar 
panels and electric vehicles at a rapid rate. These resources 
provide benefits to consumers, but present serious 
cybersecurity challenges to our grid. While experts are still 
determining the degree of risk, there is concern that these new 
resources can serve as additional entry points for cyber 
adversaries to target the grid, and could have the possibility 
to cause major disruptions.
    As cyberattacks on our energy system have increased, our 
nation's national and energy security relies on steadfast 
commitment from our federal agencies and private partners. DOE 
is the Sector Risk Management Agency for the energy sector. 
This means DOE has the responsibility to coordinate information 
sharing and response operations, technology development and 
deployment, and other energy cybersecurity responsibilities 
across the Federal Government. In that role, DOE works closely 
with FERC and NERC, which have jurisdiction over cybersecurity 
standards for electric generators and transmission, and the 
TSA, which has jurisdiction over pipeline cybersecurity.
    Yesterday, Senator Risch and I introduced the ETAC 
Establishment Act, which establishes the Energy Threat Analysis 
Center at DOE. ETAC will serve as the energy sector's 
centralized hub in the Federal Government for cyber information 
sharing and threat response so DOE will be able to better 
defend the U.S. energy sector against cyber threats and inform 
the industry of actionable steps that they can take with their 
threat response. The creation of this center is critical to the 
energy security of our nation, and I look forward to hearing 
from DOE about their work on it.
    A cybersecurity incident has the ability to cripple our 
economy, and we must pay attention. We took action last 
Congress by providing $1.9 billion in the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act to shore up cybersecurity across the 
transportation, energy, and water sectors by supporting 
utilities and state and local governments. I am immensely proud 
of this work. In addition, the CHIPS and Science bill 
authorized $14.7 billion in funding for our national labs, 
which led our nation with their expertise in advancing the 
research and development of the cybersecurity capabilities. But 
more can be done. As Chair of the Committee and the Senate 
Armed Services Cybersecurity Subcommittee, I am very invested 
in the security of our energy infrastructure. We have gathered 
before us a group of experts in this field who I know can 
provide us with recommendations that we can turn into concrete, 
bipartisan legislative action. Cybersecurity and energy 
security impacts all of us and all of our constituents. We can 
and we must continue to take steps to empower our agencies and 
industries to effectively respond to these threats.
    With that, I turn it over to Senator Barrasso for his 
opening remarks.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING

    Senator Barrasso. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree with the 
comments you made. I want to thank you for holding the hearing 
today. The reliability and resilience of the electric grid and 
our nation's pipeline network are critical to our national 
security. From healthcare to finance to manufacturing and 
transportation, these sectors rely heavily on a steady supply 
of energy to help keep our nation going.
    Nearly two years ago, the ransomware attack on the Colonial 
Pipeline offered a disturbing example of the cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities of our nation's critical energy infrastructure. 
It forced a temporary shutdown of a pipeline network that 
supplies almost half of the gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel to 
the Eastern part of the United States. As China and Russia have 
grown more aggressive on the world stage, so too have their 
tactics in cyberspace. In the opening weeks of Russia's 
invasion of Ukraine, Russian counter-connected hackers 
attempted to take almost a dozen American power plants and 
natural gas sites offline. Mr. Lee, who is testifying before us 
today, described the malicious software they used as a wartime 
capability. Russian cyberattacks are an immediate threat to the 
American energy sector. It is the Chinese government, though, 
that poses the greatest long-term cyber threat to America's 
critical energy infrastructure.
    China has been targeting American pipeline control systems 
for more than a decade. The FBI and the Department of Homeland 
Security believe these hackers are attempting to establish 
control over American pipelines to use in future China-backed 
operations. The Director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency warned us just a few weeks ago 
about China. She said that in the case of an invasion of 
Taiwan, China would likely launch cyberattacks against 
America's critical energy infrastructure. She stated, ``the big 
threat we all need to care about is China.'' Now, the Biden 
Administration has prioritized, wrongly so, prioritized 
greening of the grid over the reliability of energy production 
and delivery. This is a dangerous mistake. It dramatically 
increases the risk to our national security. From solar panels 
to electric vehicles, this Administration is forcing the rapid 
adoption of technology that is inherently more vulnerable to 
cyberattacks and exploitation.
    According to leading cybersecurity experts, electric 
vehicles offer orders of magnitude more targets for 
cyberattacks than standard internal combustion engines--orders 
of magnitude--greater risk. Remarkably, the Secretary of Energy 
chose to downgrade the leadership of the Department's Office of 
Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response. This is 
at the very time that her own department is pushing the 
adoption of technologies that pose an increased cybersecurity 
risk. Soon after Secretary Granholm was sworn in, I, along with 
a bipartisan group of Senators, wrote her to urge the 
Department to assign an Assistant Secretary to lead the 
Department's Office of Cybersecurity. We explained the role of 
the office would be diminished if a Senate-confirmed official 
did not lead it. She took no action. Two months later, the 
Colonial Pipeline was hacked and forced to shut down.
    To revitalize the Department of Energy's Cybersecurity 
Office, Senators Risch and Collins and Crapo and I introduced a 
bill this week to ensure that an Assistant Secretary will lead 
the Department's Cybersecurity Office. Restoring the office to 
its prior standing is an obvious first step, but more needs to 
be done. The Federal Government must get its cyber house in 
order. It must do more to counter on China and Russia. We must 
work to strengthen public-private partnerships to improve the 
cybersecurity of our critical infrastructure and we must not 
weaken our security in the headlong rush to electrify 
everything.
    I want to thank the witnesses for all joining us today. I 
look forward to their testimony and to their answering our 
questions.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Barrasso.
    And I would like to turn to our witnesses now. We will 
begin with Mr. Kumar, then he will be followed by Mr. Lee and 
then Mr. Swick. I want to thank you all again for joining us 
today and we will start with Mr. Kumar.

STATEMENT OF PUESH M. KUMAR, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF CYBERSECURITY, 
  ENERGY SECURITY, AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PREPAREDNESS, U.S. 
                      DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

    Mr. Kumar. Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member Barrasso, and 
distinguished members of the Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today on behalf of the Department of 
Energy on our efforts to secure the nation's critical energy 
infrastructure. I appreciate the Committee's ongoing 
partnership on this critical issue. It is undeniable, cyber 
risks to energy systems are increasing both from nation states 
such as China and Russia and from criminal actors. For the past 
four years running, each annual threat assessment of the U.S. 
intelligence community has pointed to persistent and malicious 
cyber threats facing U.S. infrastructure. These reports are 
clear. The cyber actors targeting U.S. energy infrastructure 
are a threat to national security.
    Simultaneously, the energy sector is becoming steadily more 
digitally connected and interconnected. This interconnectedness 
increases the grid's flexibility and ability to recover after 
disruptions, making it stronger and more resilient. However, as 
our digital footprint increases, there are inherently more 
access points for cyber adversaries to exploit. DOE is uniquely 
positioned to address malicious cyber threats facing the U.S. 
energy sector, and we are doing so in three significant ways: 
(1) by enhancing cyber threat collaboration with the private 
sector, (2) by strengthening the cybersecurity of hardware and 
software used in the sector, and (3) by embracing the 
philosophy of security by design when designing the energy 
systems of the future. Today, I am pleased to provide a brief 
overview of these activities, starting with one of CESER's 
newer efforts to strengthen the cybersecurity of the energy 
sector.
    The recently released National Cybersecurity Strategy 
raised the bar for public-private collaboration and 
specifically named DOE's pilot of the Energy Threat Analysis 
Center, or ETAC, as an example of the new and innovative 
capabilities that the nation needs to effectively collaborate 
at the scale and speed required to defend critical 
infrastructure from cyber threats. The ETAC pilot brings 
experts from government and industry, intel and non-intel, to 
jointly analyze and address cyber threats to the energy sector. 
The goal is to establish a collective defense posture by 
connecting dots between what industry is seeing on private-
sector networks to what we are seeing through government 
channels to get a true picture of the cyber threats and then be 
able to get timely and actual information out to owners and 
operators across the country in an expeditious manner. We plan 
on leveraging the incredible capabilities at the national 
laboratories, subject matter expertise from electricity, oil 
and natural gas companies, manufacturers, and cyber technology 
companies to come together in a unified front under the ETAC 
pilot.
    On supply chain security, it is imperative that hardware 
and software is secure before it is deployed in the sector. To 
that end, we are partnering with global manufacturers such as 
GE, Schweitzer, and Schneider to secure their systems through 
testing and innovation. These partnerships have resulted in the 
discovery of vulnerabilities in critical equipment that we have 
been able to address before they are exploited by cyber actors. 
Finally, recognizing that it is far more efficient and cost-
effective to build in cybersecurity measures as technologies 
are designed than it is to bolt them on once the technology is 
in the field, CESER is leading the charge to realize security 
by design in the energy sector. We are doing this in two 
fundamental ways: (1) we are partnering with states and 
industry to develop cybersecurity baselines for distribution 
systems and distributed energy resources, and (2) we are 
investing in research and development to identify, protect, 
detect, respond, and recover from cyber intrusions. The R&D 
efforts are threat-informed so that we are building 
cybersecurity solutions not only for the threats of today, but 
also the threats of tomorrow. These solutions rely on strong 
partnerships with our industry colleagues--an individual from 
AEP on the panel today, national laboratories, academia, and 
other private-sector companies.
    Energy security is critical to our national security, and 
CESER is committed to ensuring that the U.S. energy sector is 
secure and resilient for Americans today and for generations to 
come. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look 
forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Kumar follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    And now, we are going to go to Mr. Lee.

                  STATEMENT OF ROBERT M. LEE, 
                CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, DRAGOS, INC.

    Mr. Lee. Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member Barrasso, and 
members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to 
testify before you today.
    I am Robert Lee, the CEO and co-founder of Dragos, a 
leading industrial cybersecurity technology provider. Five 
years ago, I testified before this Committee about the 
industrial cybersecurity threat landscape, focusing 
specifically on the operational technology, or what we call OT, 
and those industrial control systems. These are the specialized 
computers and networks that interact with the physical 
environment, such as a control system that opens up a circuit 
breaker on an electric substation or gas turbine control system 
that generates electricity. They are what make critical 
infrastructure critical.
    Despite decades of focus on infrastructure cybersecurity, 
the industrial portion of that had largely been ignored and 
under-invested in. At the time, I noted there were only five 
state-actor cyber groups that were explicitly targeting 
industrial networks. Now, Dragos tracks over 20 such groups, 
including those that have targeted human life directly. Today, 
my message has more urgency. My testimony this morning focuses 
on what has changed over the last five years and the actions we 
must take to protect our national security and our local 
communities. I will present three key points that are relevant 
to this hearing's focus.
    My first point is that the industrial threat landscape has 
shifted irreversibly this past year. Prior to 2018, the 
heterogeneous nature of our industrial infrastructure made it 
difficult for adversaries to create repeatable attacks that 
caused disruption or physical damage. For good reason, industry 
has moved toward homogenous infrastructure, with common 
software packages, network protocols, facility designs, 
training, and so forth. I warned that one day an adversary 
would take advantage of this, though, and it would be a massive 
shift for the industry. In 2022, that adversary emerged. Dragos 
was contacted by an undisclosed third party that identified a 
new collection of malware, and our experts analyzed this 
capability, and with permission, partnered closely with U.S. 
Government agencies. We coined this capability ``PIPEDREAM.''
    PIPEDREAM was developed by a highly capable, strategic 
state adversary, and is the first reusable, cross-industry 
capability that can achieve disruptive or destructive effects 
on domestic industrial equipment. Based on Dragos's assessment, 
PIPEDREAM initially targeted energy assets, but can work in 
almost all operational environments, including military weapon 
systems. PIPEDREAM cannot just simply be patched away. Once it 
is in a network, it is a reliable tool for attack, making 
detection and response of those capabilities as important as 
prevention. There is a victory here as well, though. Dragos 
worked very closely with the National Security Agency, Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency, and Department of Energy to further analyze 
and report on PIPEDREAM out to the broader infrastructure 
community prior to it being employed. This makes it one of the 
most significant public-private partnership wins of all time in 
cybersecurity, in my opinion.
    For my second point, I turn to how the government can be 
more effective in countering strategic national threats by 
seeking to understand and prioritize what is working and stop 
spending effort on things that are not.
    A few examples: Government labs are still a resource to 
create their own cybersecurity technologies, most of which are 
duplicative with existing commercial technologies. I struggle 
to name one cybersecurity technology from a national lab from 
the last 20 years that is commercially viable or still used 
across the industry today. Yet, these same labs and the 
Department of Energy have an amazing set of talent and do a 
great job on strategic efforts like cyber-informed engineering. 
That is, of course, to rethink how we design the energy system 
of the future to engineer out some of the cyber risk. I 
recommend refocusing national lab programs to utilize their 
amazing talent on similar, longer-term, strategic initiatives.
    Industry also needs, as another example, harmonized 
messaging from government agencies. A typical power company 
receives guidance and priorities from the DHS, the DOE, FBI 
field offices, DOD, all their bases in the various service 
territory, state regulators, state officials, federal 
regulators, and federal officials. These priorities identified 
by all the different agencies often differ, causing analysis 
paralysis in the security teams, leaving many companies not 
knowing exactly what the government would like them to do. 
Regulations also overlap in intent, but are often not aligned 
with each other. We need to regulate toward outcomes, not 
prescriptive requirements, using the expertise of the private 
sector, and be sure they are not counterproductive to what we 
are trying to accomplish, such as overlapping reporting 
requirements that cause confusion. Ultimately, the Federal 
Government should eliminate duplicative or unnecessary projects 
and redirect supports and efforts, such as cyber-informed 
engineering and the Energy Threat Analysis Center.
    The third point is that the government must identify what 
is critical, especially with the risk scenarios and resources 
that are required. As an example, the government must be 
resourced appropriately to protect its own networks. DOE and 
CISA both require authorities and resourcing to all the DOE and 
government agencies accountable for cybersecurity requirements 
on new projects, such as distributed energy resources. It is 
difficult for the government to talk credibly on the topic of 
cybersecurity when its institutions sometimes have less 
security than most energy sites.
    So in conclusion, leadership is necessary on actual 
priorities and requirements. PIPEDREAM has changed the game, 
and ultimately, the government does have an important role and 
responsibility to play. I sincerely thank the Committee for 
providing me the opportunity to testify today and welcome any 
questions or requests for additional information.

STATEMENT OF STEPHEN L. SWICK, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, AMERICAN 
                         ELECTRIC POWER

    Mr. Swick. Good morning, Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member 
Barrasso, members of the Committee, and fellow panelists. My 
name is Steve Swick. I am the Chief Security Officer of 
American Electric Power, where I am responsible for both 
physical and cybersecurity. I have led AEP cybersecurity for 
over 25 years. Prior to my time at AEP, I served in the U.S. 
Air Force and helped establish initial cyber-response 
capabilities in the U.S. with the Air Force Computer Emergency 
Response Team, which was prior to the creation of U.S. Cyber 
Command. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak with you 
today about threats facing U.S. critical infrastructure, and in 
particular, the electric power industry.
    Today's cyber threats are complex and dynamic, requiring 
flexibility, creativity, and collaboration to address. At AEP, 
we firmly believe that resilience begins with security and 
security is resilience. Offensive cyber tools and services are 
now widely accessible to bad actors of all types, from low-
level criminals to nation states. The recently released Office 
of Director of National Intelligence Annual Threat Assessment 
asserts that nation-states are developing offensive cyber 
capabilities for the purpose of impacting critical 
infrastructure, including the electric power industry. To best 
protect the electric grid, we must proactively identify 
threats, coordinate a collective strategy to shield against 
them, and share relevant intelligence and mitigations to 
strengthen our defenses. AEP participates in forums and 
collaborates with groups and governmental entities, including 
the CEO-led Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, and the 
public-private Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Group. We 
work closely with the Energy Information Sharing and Analysis 
Center and the Department of Energy's Cybersecurity, Energy 
Security, and Emergency Response Office, which allows us to 
benefit from DOE's expertise. AEP also maintains close ties 
with state governments in our service territory, which allows 
us to ensure timely and accurate data sharing.
    Security standards play an important role in defending 
against bad actors. However, these standards should be flexible 
and practical in their application to support alignment across 
the industry. Overly prescriptive regulations can hamper our 
ability to quickly respond to new threats and often make 
achieving the intended security objective a challenge. To 
prepare for and defend for the future, we will need improved 
vendor integrity and product security. Encouraging vendors to 
focus on security by design and being first to security rather 
than first to market enables members of this sector, regardless 
of size, to have a reasonable level of confidence in their 
security investments.
    We also need to encourage more mature cyber hygiene and 
adoption of secure products. Incentivizing utilities to adopt a 
robust, holistic, and long-term cyber resilience program 
through the recent FERC notice of proposed rulemaking is an 
important step toward a more secure electric grid. Speed of 
sharing is also a key priority to improve the speed of 
collective action in cyberspace. Collaboration spaces, like 
DOE's Energy Threat Analysis Center, offer a potential way to 
deepen our public-private partnership and reduce time to share. 
For utilities like AEP that provide services in several states, 
competing--and at times conflicting--requirements can increase 
the burden of sharing information and slow progress. As the 
national cybersecurity strategy highlights, harmonizing 
regulations is a key priority, of which AEP is very supportive.
    We hope this is the start of an ongoing dialogue, and I 
thank you for the opportunity to address you on these issues. I 
would be happy to respond to any questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Swick follows:]
   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Now we are going to start with the questions. I will begin 
with mine. The energy cybersecurity threat environment--this is 
for all the panelists, you can think about this--is rapidly 
evolving, requiring constant adjustments to protect this. The 
proliferation of network-connected equipment and the improper 
stewardship of sensitive data can lead to enormous 
consequences, as we found with the Colonial Pipeline ransomware 
attack and other attacks. It is increasingly clear that the 
state and non-state actors are targeting our energy 
infrastructure to disrupt our economy and for financial gain. 
We have various vulnerabilities. I wanted to get the panelists' 
perspective on the current cyber threat environment. We have 
many more critical assets in different areas, whether it is 
going to be the Colonial Pipeline and other areas such as that. 
If I was going to create a cyberattack, I would hit the most 
critical to have the most impact, to send the greatest message.
    So are we hardening those first? Have we picked our 
priorities? Do you all know of anything that is being done or 
would you suggest something that should be done?
    And we can start right and go down the line, very quickly, 
if you can.
    Mr. Kumar. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question.
    You have raised a really important piece of this. When I 
think of what keeps me up at night in terms of the various 
cyber threats, there are three big buckets that I think about. 
One is, like you said, there are increasing cyber threats. The 
intel community keeps telling us--China, Russia, and then with 
Colonial, it was a criminal actor that was able to disrupt. So 
if a criminal actor is able to disrupt that, imagine the 
capabilities of a nation-state to conduct a similar incident.
    Number two, it is the digitization. The reality is, the 
grid, and the energy sector more broadly, is becoming more 
digitally connected, and that is good, because it helps us 
become more reliable and more resilient as a country. It lets 
us connect different generation sources from across the 
country, but we also have an opportunity to build in security. 
And so that is another area that, as we become more digitally 
connected as a society, we need to be including cybersecurity.
    And three, we need to look at our workforce. The reality 
is, across the country we have a shortage of about 700,000 
cybersecurity professionals across critical infrastructure in 
the United States. And if you just think about energy, it is 
folks who know energy and----
    The Chairman. What are we doing to educate or recruit?
    Mr. Kumar. We need to do both of those, sir.
    The Chairman. Are we doing it?
    Mr. Kumar. We have programs involved to work on exactly 
that. Of our current workforce, our future workforce, both 
pieces need to be addressed----
    The Chairman. Very quickly because I only have so much 
time. Let me ask this to all of you to make sure you tell me. 
Have we prioritized--do you know of any groups, such as 
yourself, that are working to prioritize the most critical 
infrastructure we have in all segments of our society?
    Mr. Kumar. Sir, we at the Department, that is one of our 
roles as sector management agency----
    The Chairman. How far along are you?
    Mr. Kumar. We have an electric sector risk register.
    The Chairman. Could you share that with our Committee? I 
know that Senator Barrasso and all of us would be really, 
really interested in seeing what you have identified as 
critical and what we have done to date.
    Mr. Kumar. Sir, we are happy to brief you on that.
    The Chairman. Yes, please.
    Mr. Lee. I would briefly state that I am very excited about 
the DOE's work, but I don't think we have those critical lists. 
I think there are a lot of overlapping lists, and some of the 
most critical sites in the country are based on use cases. You 
want to put troops in the South China Sea in a conflict? It is 
not going to be the largest sites that are important. It might 
be a tiny substation supporting a port. And nowhere in the 
government am I aware that that is identified.
    The Chairman. Are you all doing that yourself--evaluating 
it?
    Mr. Lee. Not from a Dragos perspective, but it is something 
that I have testified about before that the government should 
absolutely look at.
    The Chairman. Why are you not?
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Lee. We are working with the sector to do that, sir. 
And we are happy to brief you on that.
    The Chairman. Well, we are going to bring all of you--and 
Mr. Swick, real quick.
    Mr. Swick. So as a major asset owner, I know myself, as AEP 
is prioritizing all the critical assets. We have a tiering 
methodology----
    The Chairman. How well are you connected with the 
government trying to give you advice or recommendations or 
alerting you to any type of challenges you may have?
    Mr. Swick. Regular classified and unclassified level 
discussions on----
    The Chairman. That's good.
    Mr. Swick [continuing]. What we think is most critical and 
where we should focus and all that, and that includes my peers, 
larger peers.
    The Chairman. Are you working on hardening your most 
critical substations and infrastructure?
    Mr. Swick. Oh, absolutely. That has been underway for a 
long time and we continue to look and reevaluate as new threats 
evolve and new things change.
    The Chairman. Okay, real quick on this. Given your roles at 
CESER--and this is for Mr. Kumar, very quickly--and how 
important transformers are for maintaining electric 
reliability, especially when recovering from malicious attacks 
on equipment and natural disasters, the lead times for new 
distribution transformers are as long as three years, when 
these products were available within 8 to 12 weeks just a few 
years ago. I don't know what happened to the production line.
    What concrete action is DOE taking to address the 
transformer shortages?
    Mr. Kumar. Sir, that is a really important issue. Last 
year, we partnered with the electricity sector owners and 
operators to identify what was the cause of specific supply 
challenges that we were having across the country. We also----
    The Chairman. What did you find out?
    Mr. Kumar. There are two big items that we learned. One was 
labor. A lot of the transformer manufacturers did not have the 
labor to actually produce some of the transformers. The second 
thing was minerals. And then the third thing that was a 
contributing factor was, as we become more electrified as a 
community, it was putting a demand on increasing more of the 
production.
    The Chairman. Let me ask you this. You are all seeing it 
firsthand of what happens if we do not have the critical 
minerals supply or reliable foreign supply chain. Then why 
don't you push harder for us to get permitting done to where we 
can secure our own? If DOE would speak up, it might help us.
    Mr. Kumar. Mr. Chairman, we could not agree more that 
permitting is an issue that we do need to address. It would 
help connect sources of generation and potentially help 
alleviate some of the----
    The Chairman. I have been talking to Secretary Granholm and 
we need the Department's voice involved in this very much.
    Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks so much, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Lee, President Biden's Senior Advisor for Clean Energy 
Innovation and Implementation, John Podesta--he stated just a 
few weeks ago that domestic manufacturing for clean energy 
technologies is going depend on, in his words, ``China-
dominated supply chains.'' That is what the White House is 
saying. They are going to depend on China-dominated supply 
chains. Do you believe that a reliance on China for critical 
components of clean energy technology presents, say, an 
increased cybersecurity risk to the grid and to American 
families?
    Mr. Lee. Yes, sir, absolutely. And beyond the cybersecurity 
risk, even depending on them for what we need for critical 
national security use cases, even if they were trying to help 
us, outsourcing that to another country is probably not the 
best idea.
    Senator Barrasso. So Mr. Kumar, what do you think? I mean, 
this is the Administration.
    Mr. Kumar. So thank you, Senator, for the question. Your 
identification of the threats from China are very real and we 
need to take those threats seriously. So what we need to be 
doing is, we really need to be thinking about what requirements 
we need to put on manufacturers from China versus domestic 
manufacturers. The reality is, we do need to go ahead and push 
on domestic manufacturing to ensure that we have more secure, 
resilient supply chains, from a security perspective, but to 
the Chairman's question, also from an availability perspective. 
We need to be able to produce these things domestically.
    Now, if they are being acquired from nations like China, we 
might need to think about additional requirements for security 
before we install them here in the United States.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, I wish you would take that message 
back to the White House.
    Mr. Lee, so here is a Wall Street Journal article, 
cybersecurity, ``Could Electric Vehicles Be Hacked?'' And the 
picture inside shows a guy looking in his rear-view mirror and 
seeing the spy sitting in the back seat. Mr. Chairman, there is 
a spy sitting in the back seat----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Barrasso. How EVs might be hacked. Right there.
    The Chairman. Do we know that person?
    Senator Barrasso. Ah, well, we don't, but you know, it 
could be--looking from this situation and what we are looking 
at and who is coming after us, we know likely where the sources 
of these are.
    [The article referred to follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Barrasso. So the Wall Street Journal, ``Could 
Electric Vehicles Be Hacked?'' The subheading answers the 
question--yes. There are all sorts of potential doors in EVs 
for hackers to take advantage of. So cybersecurity expert Jim 
Guinn goes on to say, ``Some of the EV charging networks are 
very insecure because they were not designed with security in 
mind.''
    So do you believe that EVs and the EV charging network 
increase the cyber risk for consumers and the grid?
    Mr. Lee. Yes, absolutely. When you look at any of these 
lower cost assets, to include distributed energy resources, it 
is very common for the priority to be, as was stated by Mr. 
Swick, first to market, no security built in. The cheaper the 
asset, usually the less security you have.
    Senator Barrasso. So Director Kumar, how is your office 
working with the rest of the Department to ensure that the 
consumers are protected from this expanded cyber risk that has 
been pointed out in the paper and to Mr. Lee's comments about 
first to market, cheapest to be produced, highest risk?
    Mr. Kumar. Senator Barrasso, thank you for that question. 
We really do think we need to think about it across a couple of 
different ways. The first one is, we need to think about what 
are the policies we need to be thinking about. What are the 
cyber baselines that we need to ensure--DERs, EV stations, EV 
providers, need to be considering. So that is an effort we have 
underway currently to develop those baselines for things like 
EV manufacturing.
    The second thing we are doing is, we are leveraging the 
capabilities of our partnerships with industry--so the EV 
manufacturers themselves and the national laboratories. So we 
have an effort underway to conduct cyber testing of some of the 
charging stations out there so we can produce better security 
for some of these charging stations going forward.
    And then, most recently, a couple of months ago, the White 
House convened a meeting with EV manufacturers to talk about 
the classified threats of some of these threats that are 
heading toward us and what we can collectively do to buy down 
those threats, sir.
    Senator Barrasso. So Mr. Swick, it is abundantly clear, 
long-term integrity and cybersecurity of our critical energy 
infrastructure is going to depend on effective public-private 
partnerships. In your view, what could the Federal Government 
be doing better in its efforts to work with the private sector 
to establish greater cybersecurity to the critical 
infrastructure that we need to protect?
    Mr. Swick. AEP is very passionate about that public-private 
partnership. Invests heavily. The efforts like ETAC, which is 
being proposed right now, are valuable because they give access 
to our utilities themselves to high-side data, collaboration 
with intelligence sources directly versus some briefings that 
many of us attend. So I think that is a good step. The other 
piece to that is more clearances to make sure everybody can 
attend those. AEP will get there, but not everybody has the 
level of clearances potentially needed to get to those 
discussions that may be valuable. So continuing to push on that 
is very important. And then, standardization of regulation 
across will very much help.
    Senator Barrasso. And then, finally, to Director Kumar, you 
know, in the previous Administration your role was filled by a 
Senate-confirmed office head working through the interagency 
process. Would it be helpful if the Department of Energy Cyber 
Office had that same senior standing to signify how important 
it is with the threats that were coming out and the efforts to 
address that?
    Mr. Kumar. Senator, thank you for your continued support of 
the office. I am proud to lead the Office of Cybersecurity, and 
it is an incredible mission that I am lucky to lead from 
security and resilience--from an all hazards perspective, as 
you know, sir. This is the mission that brought me back from 
the private sector, to come back and lead this. It was too 
important to not do it. I will defer to the President and 
Congress on the title of the position, but I can confidently 
tell you that I have access to the Department's resources and 
leaders to accomplish this mission.
    Senator Barrasso. Mr. Lee, do you have an opinion on it?
    Mr. Lee. I do. Director Kumar is fantastic. I have known 
him for years and I am surprised the position was not elevated, 
absolutely. It has caused them to be sidelined in some 
meetings. Titles matter in government, whether we like it or 
not.
    Senator Barrasso. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Cortez Masto.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. This is a great 
conversation and so I appreciate it.
    Let me say this--I agree. This position needs to be 
elevated. This should have been done a long time ago, under 
previous Administrations. You know, I just have to say this is 
a conversation that we keep having over and over and over 
again. It is time to do something on so many levels. And let me 
just bring you back here because when I was attorney general of 
the state, I created the Technological Crimes Division to 
address all these issues. At that time, we were talking about 
the need for secure-by-design products. It is so ridiculous 
that we take all these off the shelf and then try to 
superimpose some cybersecurity on it. Now we are going into the 
21st century with this new technology and we are not forcing 
the secure-by-design because now it still is first to the 
market. It is a crazy conversation but we have been having it 
for the last 20 years. So I am just, I am so frustrated, as you 
can tell, with this conversation that we repeat over and over 
and it is time we do something about it. We have to elevate 
this discussion. We have to make sure we make it a priority at 
the federal level. The states want it. I wanted it when I was 
working in the state. We all need to be collaborating for the 
very reasons that you are all talking about.
    Now, let me just take it to one specific area that I am 
concerned about because we have oversight over this, which is 
the electrical grid. The transformers conversation is not new. 
It is something, again, there are not only books written about 
it, but it is an issue that we keep talking about. I know this. 
You all know this. We have transformers in this country. Let's 
just take the high-voltage transformers. Now, they make up less 
than three percent of U.S. transformers, but they carry 60 to 
70 percent of the nation's electricity. And there has been 
widespread agreement among government agencies, utilities, and 
manufacturers that HV transformers in the U.S. are vulnerable 
to a terrorist attack and a natural disaster, and that such an 
attack, potentially, could have catastrophic consequences. Why? 
Because these transformers are extremely large and complex grid 
equipment, which typically takes 18 to 24 months to develop and 
install. This is not new. This is something we have known.
    And so, my question, I guess, for all of you, and let me 
start with you, Mr. Kumar, is what else should we be doing 
here? You identified in response to the Chairman's question to 
you about this partnership with the private sector. It is not 
new, this issue. You identified a labor issue. Yes, it is 
there. What are we doing about it?
    Mr. Kumar. Senator, thank you for the question.
    We, as a result of some of the conversations we have been 
having on the availability of some of this equipment, first and 
foremost, we recognize that things like domestic manufacturing 
are something that we need to really be focused on as a 
government.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Yes, I know that we need to focus on 
it. But what are we doing about it? What do you need to tell us 
that can help your department figure out how we partner with 
the private sector--because the private sector is key to all of 
this--and address this very issue that we have been talking 
about for years now? What do you need from us?
    Dr. Kumar. I appreciate you asking that. You know, I think 
there is--we are thinking of this problem as both a short-term 
problem and a medium- and long-term problem. So domestic 
manufacturing is not going to address the short-term issues. It 
is going to address the medium- and long-term issues. Short-
term, you know, one of the things we have been talking about is 
allocating funds for the Defense Production Act to actually 
start to incentivize building transformers here in the United 
States. That is a short-term solution. The other solutions we 
are working with the utilities and manufacturers on are 
thinking through apprenticeship programs to bring people into 
the trade of building transformers. So we have actually 
connected the Department of Labor and the Department of 
Commerce with manufacturers and we are going to be actioning 
some of that effort going forward.
    Another area we are going to be focusing on is 
standardization. So how do we reduce the production times to 
develop some of these big pieces of equipment, as you 
rightfully noted. They take, in some cases, 18 months. Plus, 
for large power transformers, how do we improve, increase the 
speed of the production of some of those transformers? So 
standardization is another piece that we are going to be 
looking at.
    And finally, my colleagues in the Office of Electricity are 
focused on how to make transformers more modular. How to make 
the production and movement of these big pieces of equipment--
through innovation and R&D--how to make it easier to build some 
of these things going forward. So we need to be looking at all 
of those areas that you rightfully noted, Ma'am.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. And I only have so much 
time left. Any other panelists want to comment on this as well?
    Mr. Lee. Yes, I would just briefly state that the electric 
utilities have done an amazing job and they are highly 
regulated already. Put more requirements on the vendors. As a 
vendor, my software is deployed in nuclear power plants and 
rail providers and things like that and we made the extremely 
costly choice to put 100 percent of our software developers as 
U.S. citizens in the U.S. Why do I have that choice as a vendor 
servicing national security requirements?
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    Anything else?
    Mr. Swick. I would just add that the supply chain diversity 
in vendors is really one of the ways we are looking at to help 
manage the risk. We do realize it. We have sharing agreements 
where we can share transformers across and focus on the 
managing of the supply as well as the cyber risk. So thank you.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. Very helpful. Appreciate 
it.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Now we have Senator Hawley. Early, early--early Hawley.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank 
you. Early bird gets the worm.
    Mr. Kumar, let me start with you. We have talked about 
software targeting American networks. I want to ask you about 
hardware in some of these systems, particularly transformers. 
Some of the components for transformers, of course, are 
produced in China, and the risk of malicious hardware implants 
was sufficiently high that the last Administration seized some 
Chinese transformers back in 2020.
    The Chairman. Senator Hawley.
    Senator Hawley. Yes.
    The Chairman. Could I interrupt you?
    Senator Hawley. Sure.
    The Chairman. For just a second because we have seven and 
we have some business that we need to get done.
    Senator Hawley. Yes.
    The Chairman. We will come right back to you, okay?
    [RECESS TO BUSINESS MEETING]
    The Chairman. And we will now resume our hearing, and back 
to Senator Hawley.
    Thank you.
    Senator Hawley. Great, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Ah, there we go, just waiting for my time to be reset.
    All right, Mr. Kumar, back to you. We were talking about 
transformers and I was about to ask you if you know what 
percentage of the U.S. electric grid contains components that 
are manufactured in China?
    Mr. Kumar. Senator Hawley, thank you for the question, and 
I appreciate your recognition that we really need to be focused 
on the China threat when it comes to the grid equipment, both 
hardware and software that is deployed across the United 
States.
    Where we have really been focused is on four different 
areas here. One is, we need to understand what are those 
critical components that, if disrupted, could have a 
debilitating impact on the United States. The second area where 
we are focused is on establishing provenance to really 
understanding what is in this equipment, what is in the 
subcomponent levels and what pieces are potentially from an 
adversarial nation, like China. The third area we are focused 
on is testing. So we are testing some of this equipment down to 
the chip level and down to the software level in partnership 
with the DOE national laboratories. And then finally, we are 
getting education and awareness out to the sector. That is 
where the focus of our effort is right now, and we are doing 
some of that analysis currently, and we are happy to brief you 
on some of that work.
    Senator Hawley. So does that mean you don't know? You don't 
know what percentage of the grid contains components 
manufactured in China?
    Mr. Kumar. So sir, there's a number of components that are 
built. The hard part about some of these questions is, you 
know, at the top level it could be, it looks like an American 
manufacturer or a friendly country.
    Senator Hawley. That is why I am asking you.
    Mr. Kumar. The reality is, when you go down to the 
subcomponent level, that is where it gets a lot harder. So our 
focus is really looking at all of that equipment and we are 
doing that analysis right now to see what pieces of equipment 
have some of these concerning areas. Now----
    Senator Hawley. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, so my 
time is limited here, but I just want to--so it sounds like you 
don't know. When do you think you might know? You say you are 
doing the analysis. When will it be done and when will we find 
out?
    Mr. Kumar. Sir, we are doing a broad analysis on what are 
the critical components in the sector and what we need to be 
prioritizing when it comes to some of our testing. And we are 
taking a risk-based approach. The reality is----
    Senator Hawley. But when will you know? When will you know? 
So I didn't think this would be very hard. I asked you what 
percentage of the grid contains components manufactured in 
China. You don't know. But you say you are looking at it. I 
just want to know when you are going to be done. When are we 
going to know?
    Mr. Kumar. So sir, it is a complex question. As you know, 
the grid is very--it has thousands and--of hardware----
    Senator Hawley. Date. I am looking for a date. I am looking 
for a date. You are exhausting my patience now. When are you 
going to be done with the analysis?
    Mr. Kumar. Sir, I think, so the one thing we have to 
remember is when you have an analysis like this, China may not 
just choose to exploit equipment they are developing. They may 
choose to exploit equipment that is developed by someone else 
that has a vulnerability----
    Senator Hawley. Oh, my gosh. I feel like I am on the Senate 
floor. This is like a filibuster. Okay, I will give this to you 
for the record.
    Let me try something else.
    What percentage of large power transformers are 
manufactured in China? Do you know that?
    Mr. Kumar. So currently that number is not as high. We are 
doing----
    Senator Hawley. Well, wait a minute. You just told me a 
second ago you don't have any idea what the number is. When you 
say it is not as high, what are we even talking about here?
    Mr. Kumar. So the United States is not purchasing as many 
large power transformers----
    Senator Hawley. How many?
    Mr. Kumar. As it was back in the day----
    Senator Hawley. Back in the day? What does that even mean?
    Mr. Kumar. So what I find is a lot of the utilities 
themselves recognize the China risk and they themselves are not 
purchasing these large power transformers----
    Senator Hawley. Well, what percentage are manufactured in 
China of our large power transformers? Do you know? It's fine 
if you don't know. I am just trying to get answers here. You 
just say ``I don't know'' and then I am going to ask you when 
you are going to know. Just----
    Mr. Kumar. I am happy to get back with you on the answer, 
sir.
    Senator Hawley. Okay.
    Okay, I find this really quite baffling. This leads me to 
ask why it is that this Administration suspended the last 
Administration's executive order that restricted the 
procurement of foreign electric equipment. That was Executive 
Order 13920. Why did they? I mean, why allow procurement of 
foreign electric equipment that could be so dangerous to the 
grid? Do you know why this happened?
    Mr. Kumar. So sir, right now, what the focus is, we have to 
take a holistic view of supply chain security. Just having an 
approved/unapproved list is not the only way to secure our 
supply chains----
    Senator Hawley. But that may be true. I am just wondering 
why would we allow China, a country that is suspected of 
numerous cyberattacks against us, to supply major components 
for our electrical grid. I mean, is that a smart thing to do?
    Mr. Kumar. So again, what we are taking is a more strategic 
approach to this to look all of those different pieces I just 
mentioned, to ensure we look at security from all different 
aspects, including security by design, which is a key component 
of how we need to tackle this problem. It is too large of a 
problem to start to have one solution, which was the solution 
in that executive order. Now, that executive order is under 
review. I defer to the White House in terms of a replacement 
executive order, but know that this is an area that is a 
priority for us at the department to ensure that the supply 
chain is secure and we are doing that very actively.
    Senator Hawley. Well, all right, my time is expired and 
there's lots of my colleagues who want to ask questions. I am 
going to give these questions to you, again, for the record. I 
would like to know what percentage of the grid contains 
components manufactured in China. And if you don't know, that 
is fine. I would like to know when you are going to have your 
analysis done. I would like to know what percentage of large 
power transformers are manufactured in China.
    And I just humbly submit to you that allowing China--
getting procurement of electric equipment made in China and 
allowing it to be integrated into our grid is a bad idea. And I 
am baffled as to why this Administration is allowing it to go 
forward. I will probably have some more questions for you for 
the record.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    And Mr. Kumar, I think it is fair to say that we would all 
like to see what our dependency is on China's supply chain 
because we are trying to break that immediately, if not 
quicker. Thank you.
    With that, we have now, Senator Hickenlooper.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Mr. Ranking 
Member. Thank all of you for taking the time and being with us.
    Let me start with Mr. Lee. I was intrigued by your 
suggestion of how we could help infrastructure asset owners and 
operators. You suggested that the U.S. Government might clarify 
cyber roles and responsibilities in the energy sector to 
identify requirements and identify realistic threat scenarios. 
To what degree is some of that already happening, and what 
needs to occur to accelerate that and actually realize the 
goal?
    Mr. Lee. Thank you, Senator.
    There is a lot of collaboration that happens, but the short 
answer is, a lot of times the requirements are to be 
cybersecure against cyber risks and that is just not actionable 
to anybody. So it would be much more effective if the 
government clarified what it wants out of a pipeline or what it 
wants an electric grid operator to do, and again, to what 
scenarios. Are we concerned with a Chinese-based threat 
scenario that we have seen before? Let's clarify that and have 
them focus on that. And most importantly, I think it is 
important for the government to advise on why they care, what 
they want the outcome to be, but not tell the asset owners how 
to do it. There's so much expertise at these electric 
companies, they will figure out the how, just clarify why we 
are doing it and what you want.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great, I appreciate that.
    Mr. Swick, in your testimony you talked about the need for 
non-prescriptive regulation that allows for customized 
solutions. Actually, you all said that to a certain extent. You 
also described the difficulty operating in different states 
with different regulations. Almost ten years ago, I helped put 
together the National Cybersecurity Center in Colorado Springs, 
which specifically tries to discuss that and address that and 
look at that. Have you got any thoughts on how we can harmonize 
regulations, including between state and federal levels, 
without making them overly prescriptive?
    Mr. Swick. Actually, I have talked to my friend, Puesh, at 
the end a few times about this on how we can----
    Senator Hickenlooper. Well, he is next. He is next.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Swick. Okay.
    So baselines that we can get out to the states to have them 
design their requirements around those so we are all hitting 
the same target across all the states and at the federal level 
will help us a lot because that is the concern we have when we 
have to hit various targets, whether it is reporting 
requirements or security requirements, that puts a lot of extra 
load on us, determining what the actual request is, as well as 
implementing it and designing it.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right. I guess I would just throw out 
there, I think it is important to make sure we get the right 
people at the table as we establish what those levels are.
    Mr. Swick. Yes.
    Senator Hickenlooper. And make sure that we have buy-in up 
and down the food chain.
    Mr. Swick. Absolutely, I very much agree, sir.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great.
    Mr. Kumar, we are hearing about the need for timely 
communication, the need for trust between energy companies, 
their suppliers, DOE. Since the government regulates so much of 
the energy space, sometimes it appears industry may be 
reluctant to share its problems for fear of drawing the 
attention of regulators and the Federal Government to possible 
shortcomings. And I think the government has to be careful 
about how and if it shares threat information, which obviously 
is often sensitive, but reflects back on those private 
operators. Cybersecurity only works when everyone is talking. I 
don't think there is any substitute for that. How can we break 
down these barriers to effective communication, and how will 
the ETAC play a pivotal role?
    Mr. Kumar. Senator, thank you for that question and I could 
not agree more with you.
    The cybersecurity community is built on trust. It is 
trusted relationships that allow information sharing. So in our 
role at the Department of Energy, we are the sector risk 
management agency for the energy sector, sir, where we leave 
the regulations to our colleagues at the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission. We let them do the regulations. We focus 
on building that trusted partnership with colleagues at the 
utilities, but also cyber technology companies and 
manufacturers. And what we have found is, they are willing to 
share with us. They want to tell us when they have a cyber 
incident. They want to make sure that it gets cascaded across 
the sector and that we have a collective defense posture. And 
that collective defense posture is where the ETAC is really 
focused on. That is the place where we want to bring together 
the community to look at threats.
    For such a long time, everyone has been looking at threats 
in their own individual companies. We look at it on the 
government side. How do we look at it together so that we can 
determine what is the true risk to our national security and 
then implement defensive measures and get information out to 
the entire sector.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right, I got that.
    I agree completely. I could not be more supportive of that. 
And you are currently working with independent contractors on a 
pilot for ETAC. Where are you on that feasibility?
    Mr. Kumar. Sir, yes. So we are conducting pilot activities 
both here in the DC area, but also out in Denver, Colorado, 
working with both the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, but 
also industry and other interagency colleagues. We have a 
critical mass there so we are leveraging some of our pilot 
activities there. And the feasibility study that we are 
currently conducting will tell us where this ETAC needs to 
live, how large it needs to be, who needs to be in it, and how 
we make sure it can include all parts of the sector. And that 
feasibility study is due to be done this summer, sir.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Oh, great. That is terrific. Well, 
anyway, keep up the good work, all of you. I appreciate it. 
Excellent panel, I say to the leadership.
    I yield back.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Now, we are anxiously awaiting to hear from Senator Hoeven.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to both you 
and the Ranking Member for holding the hearing today and I 
appreciate the witnesses being here.
    I worked with Senator Rosen, who was here earlier, and we 
passed the Cyber Sense Act, and essentially it was to help test 
products and technologies intended for use in bulk power 
systems for any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. And so, could 
you give and update on, you know, your implementation of the 
Cyber Sense Act and you know, both in terms of what you are 
doing and if you are finding that it is helpful and effective?
    Mr. Kumar. Senator, thank you for that question and thank 
you for the support of the work the Department has been doing 
on cyber testing through the energy Cyber Sense Act. That act 
allows us to bring the community together. And when I say the 
community, it is not just DOE and the labs, it is the utilities 
who are installing the equipment and it is the manufacturers 
who are building the equipment. And then, we are also thinking 
about standards organizations to build in security into some of 
the standards that are used to design the grid of the future.
    So where we are right now is, we have four global 
manufacturers who are part of the program. The first one is 
Schneider, Schweitzer, and Hitachi Energy and then a couple of 
weeks ago, this past--a month ago, in fact, we signed on GE Gas 
Power to partner with us. These are all willing partners to 
ensure that security is built in through testing, and to that 
end, we have already had a number of vulnerabilities tested, or 
found through the testing program, and we have disclosed those 
vulnerabilities, certainly to the manufacturers so they can 
patch their systems and get the fixes out. We will also 
publicly disclose them.
    Senator Hoeven. Right.
    Mr. Kumar. So the community can actually benefit from this 
testing.
    Senator Hoeven. Right. I mean, the whole idea, of course, 
is to find these things, but then to inform others so that they 
can avoid, you know, some of the cyber problems that you do 
find. So I think that is a very important part of it.
    Talk about some of the other steps you are taking, 
particularly in regard to, you know, we are so integrated in so 
many ways. If you have a cyber issue in one place, how do you 
prevent conflagration, you know, having that spread through the 
system, because things move so rapidly? The technology is 
changing so rapidly, you know, how do you create firewalls or 
breaks in the system so that it just doesn't flash through the 
system in a way where, you know, you not only have bigger 
problems, but it is really hard to track it down and root it 
out?
    Mr. Kumar. Absolutely, Senator.
    So this is where we need to be thinking about, certainly we 
talk a lot about security by design, but in some way, in the 
energy sector, we have to think about resilience by design. We 
have to think how can we limit that potential impact of a 
cyberattack. How do we limit it from actually causing a larger 
disruption? You know, we think back on the solar winds attack. 
One manufacturer that was exploited, or one software supplier 
was exploited, and it caused global impacts to companies using 
solar winds. We need to be thinking about how this is a key 
target for some cyber actors and how do we ensure that we 
cannot only protect those systems, but also ensure that it 
doesn't cause a cascading effect. This is where some of our 
research and development comes into play, where we can limit 
some of these cyberattacks and actually be able to contain them 
before they cause some of these impacts. So that is a key focus 
for us in our R&D program at CESER.
    Senator Hoeven. Yes, that is the term, you said it much 
better--cascading impacts. It seems to me you really do have to 
be very aggressive in that regard so that you don't have 
something--it's one thing to have an isolated attack or 
problem, that is bad enough, but the cascading effect, 
obviously, could get out of control and hurt. It seems to me 
that has to be a real area of focus.
    Right now, how are you doing? How are we doing? I mean, in 
terms of some of our adversaries--China, Russia, Iran, North 
Korea, so on and so forth. How are we doing on staying on top 
of this cyber issue? I mean, do we really know what is going 
on? Do you really feel confident we know what the risks are out 
there and we are getting to them, you know, you don't bat a 
thousand, but that we are on top of this?
    Mr. Kumar. So sir, this is an evolving risk landscape, and 
particularly in the cyber domain, it is a rapidly evolving 
cyber risk landscape. And so we absolutely have to stay on top 
of this. We are certainly doing that through some of the R&D 
that we are doing with the national laboratories. They are 
leading the charge on some of this. Our private-sector partners 
are also innovating quickly.
    Now, we do still have some gaps, and this is where the 
Energy Threat Analysis Center pilot is going to help us. We are 
all seeing our own cyber threats in our own spaces, but we are 
not connecting the dots. We are not seeing if this is happening 
out West, is it also happening out East? How do we connect 
those dots with what we learn from private sector networks and 
cyber technology companies with the intelligence community? 
That is where we need to go in the future if we are truly going 
to get on top of this threat.
    Senator Hoeven. Last question, real quick.
    Are you able to get the people that you need, you know, the 
sharp people with the kind of training you need to really get 
after this?
    Mr. Kumar. Senator, I really appreciate that question. When 
I started in CESER, we had a whopping 20 federal employees for 
the entire cybersecurity/energy security mission of all 
hazards. Since then, we have doubled our team, and then thanks 
to Congress and passing the budget in December, we are now able 
to even double that size. And our focus is to hire cyber 
talent, engineering talent, and we are implementing cyber 
retention incentives to attract that talent to the government 
so that we can actually execute these important programs.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you.
    Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    And now we have Senator Hirono.
    Senator Hirono. What, no adjective for me?
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Hirono. I feel hurt.
    The Chairman. You are just solid. That is all I can say is 
that you are solid, Senator.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Hirono. Okay, I will take that.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    For Mr. Kumar, we have heard from Mr. Swick of AEP, 
representing one of the largest electric utilities in the 
country. At past hearings under Chair Murkowski, we heard from 
similar or smaller utilities that struggle to find the 
resources to secure their systems from cyberattacks. As part of 
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, this Committee 
established a $250 million grant and technical assistance 
program called the Rural and Municipal Utility Advances 
Cybersecurity Grant and Technical Assistance Program--that is a 
mouthful--to help improve the cyber capabilities of smaller 
utilities and rural electric cooperatives such as the Kauai 
Island Utility Cooperative in Hawaii. Can you update us on 
DOE's implementation of this program?
    Mr. Kumar. Senator, thank you for that question, and this 
is a really important area, as we need to really be focused on 
some of those under-resourced communities. When you are 
thinking about the municipal utilities, the rural cooperatives, 
there are over 2,700 of them across the United States. So we 
need to prioritize their efforts----
    Senator Hirono. Yes, that is why we have this program.
    Mr. Kumar. That is--and I think----
    Senator Hirono. How is it going?
    Mr. Kumar. Where we are right now with the program is, we 
have conducted listening sessions with the companies 
themselves. So we had listening sessions with over 250 
municipal, rural cooperative utilities with cyber technology 
companies to really understand where we need to focus those 
resources so we can have an impact. And so, we are in the 
process, after those listening sessions that we convened, with 
all of these different stakeholders--we are now in the process 
of starting to execute some of that funding and get it out the 
door to the communities.
    Senator Hirono. So can you give me an example of what some 
of these smaller utilities and rural entities need in the area 
of cyber protection?
    Mr. Kumar. So one of the things that we found through some 
of the listening sessions is, in some cases it might just be 
cyber hygiene. In other cases, they may not have the resources 
to hire cyber talent. And so, they might need to bring in third 
parties who can come in and execute some of the cybersecurity 
measures for them. And so, we need to meet them where they are 
to ensure that we can actually have a sustainable program 
because we want to ensure that it is not going to be a thing 
where they have funding for a couple of years and then they 
don't have funding after that. It has to be sustainable.
    Senator Hirono. Yes.
    Mr. Kumar. That has been our focus, is to make sure it is a 
sustainable program beyond the life of the funding that we 
have.
    Senator Hirono. So in these listening sessions that you 
had, was the Kauai utility one of those entities that you heard 
from?
    Mr. Kumar. Senator, I am not sure right now, but I am happy 
to get back with you.
    Senator Hirono. You are available to help them, right, 
because----
    Mr. Kumar. Absolutely, ma'am.
    Senator Hirono. They are the only utility co-op in Hawaii.
    We are going to need a highly trained--again for you, Mr. 
Kumar--a trained workforce to help defend the critical 
infrastructure against these kinds of attacks, and we have 
CESER. What is CESER doing to improve post-secondary 
educational cybersecurity training curricula?
    Mr. Kumar. Senator, workforce is a key element, as I 
mentioned earlier. We have 700,000 unfilled jobs. And then when 
you actually take a look at those that know energy systems, 
that is an even smaller pool. So to that end, we are focused in 
three areas. One is the future workforce and that is focused on 
the post-secondary workforce. So we have a competition where we 
bring together colleges, universities, technical colleges, all 
together to defend energy systems in a mock cyber scenario. And 
the idea is we also connect, we bring in private sector so that 
they can look at jobs in the private sector, jobs at the 
national laboratories and of course, jobs with us in CESER. We 
are training them to understand the cyber threats and make it 
real where it is not just that cyber is a thing that happens in 
an IT environment, and it actually has operational impact to 
the availability of electricity, oil, and natural gas. And so, 
we are training them through the competition.
    Senator Hirono. That sounds good.
    Has your office considered supporting students with 
fellowship opportunities, for example, in the government or 
energy sectors, so that they can get some hands-on experience 
and create a commitment and interest in working within the 
government sector?
    Mr. Kumar. Senator, that is music to my ears. We are 
actually actively looking at fellowships to bring in fellows 
into the Department of Energy to help us accomplish our 
mission.
    Senator Hirono. Please let us know because I am a big 
supporter of internships and fellowship programs to really give 
people the experience within government and the kinds of jobs, 
et cetera, and what they can do as part of our effort, you 
know, we are all in this together. So to build that is pretty 
core. I think that is a good thing.
    Okay, I would like to ask one of the other, oh, well, I am 
out of time.
    The Chairman. Go ahead.
    Senator Hirono. Okay. For Mr. Swick, investing in the 
modern electrical grid will play a key role in ensuring 
reliable power, higher levels of renewable power, and lower 
energy bills. And you may know that Hawaii pays the highest 
electric bills, I think we still pay the highest in the 
country. So in addition, microgrids, with local energy and 
energy storage systems offer the potential to ensure hospitals, 
fire stations, and military installations can quickly recover 
from natural disasters or cyberattacks of the larger grid. What 
should regulators, owners, and operators of assets in the power 
sector do to take advantage of the benefits and reduce the 
risks that come as local power systems incorporate larger 
shares of distributed renewable power sources and energy 
storage?
    Mr. Swick. A big piece of that is making sure we manage the 
risk that those could introduce. As we have all the 
distributive resources to get connected, we need to make sure 
the right guidelines exist for them so they don't introduce 
risk while they are managing the risk. Their whole intent is to 
help manage that risk, but we need to make sure we are not 
introducing more as it is being implemented. So controlling 
those, as well as partnering with the local areas and making 
sure we figure out what they need, and AEP is doing a lot in 
those areas to help create microgrids in other distributed 
areas where we can work with partners to enable that to be 
provided.
    Senator Hirono. So do you think that the utilities are 
doing a good job to make sure that they are not introducing 
risk into their systems?
    Mr. Swick. I think the utilities are doing a good job 
helping manage that, and I am sure that some of the distributed 
providers may not have the same level of capabilities or focus 
and they may not be able to get security first to market. Those 
are some areas where, I think, we need to continue to focus and 
help manage that risk because it is things that I may not be 
able to control because I can only reach so far into it, right? 
So we need them to step up and bring secure stuff to connect.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    And Senator King.
    Senator King. I am only sorry we did not have this hearing 
last week, Mr. Chairman. We could have started it with CESER, 
beware the ides of March.
    [Laughter.]
    The Chairman. Oh, boy.
    Senator King. Sorry, I sometimes can't stop myself.
    Mr. Kumar, this rarely happens with me, but I want to 
associate myself with the questions of Senator Hawley. I think 
determining the Chinese origin content of crucial parts of the 
electric system, whether it is SCADA systems, transformers, 
wherever, is a hair-on-fire, urgent matter. The next time you 
are here, we need a much sharper answer to that because that is 
an enormous opportunity for malicious activity.
    The other point I wanted to make, Senator Manchin, is none 
of these witnesses really, but in New England anyway, the 
pipeline system is really part of the grid. Over 60 percent of 
our electricity in New England comes from natural gas. All of 
the natural gas comes through pipelines. So it bothers me that 
we have got TSA over here and FERC over here and I am not sure 
there is a consistent regulatory----
    The Chairman. We are trying to fix that, sir.
    Senator King [continuing]. Structure. I think we have to 
fix that because, you know, we can put all of our efforts into 
grid security, as you know, and then if the pipeline goes down, 
the power is off.
    Mr. Swick, do you do red teaming and pen testing of your 
system?
    Mr. Swick. Yes, sir, we do in the IT space and we do with 
substations and others to make sure we understand how they 
connect, where the risks are. We have an internal team and we 
have mandatory external testing that also occurs.
    Senator King. Hackers for hire.
    Mr. Swick. Hackers for hire, white-hat hackers, whatever we 
want to call them. We have our internal team and external----
    Senator King. Is that typical throughout the industry? 
Because I think that is really the most effective thing, 
because if you ask any CIO if we are safe, the answer is, ``of 
course.'' Nobody knows that until they are tested.
    Mr. Swick. Right. And it has to be a quality attacker. So 
if they don't find something, then go find another person 
because there is always something to find. But I do think all 
the peers I talk to leverage similar practices to make sure we 
are finding what the actual risks are and quickly address them.
    Senator King. Mr. Lee, do you think pen testing is an 
important part of this process?
    Mr. Lee. Senator, it is absolutely important, but I think 
it is also really important for the utilities and others to 
know what they are trying to accomplish out of it, which goes 
back to those requirements I mentioned that the government can 
help with about what are we actually trying to solve for. 
Having a pen tester come in just to show that something is 
exploitable may not be that valuable. Having a red team or 
someone else emulating one of the threats that we actually 
expect to face and then seeing how the systems and our people 
do in the face of that, is a wonderful endeavor.
    Senator King. But it may be important just to wake up the 
executive suite.
    Mr. Lee. When we get called in for a pen test, that is 
almost always what it is, is hey, we know there is a problem, 
but can you prove it for us to get the resourcing required?
    Senator King. Do you believe that there are already sleeper 
cells in our grid? Have they already been penetrated by the 
Russians and perhaps by the Chinese that are waiting for 
exploitation?
    Mr. Lee. I think it is a very reasonable assumption, but 
the bigger problem is, we don't know, and actually goes to your 
Chinese component discussion as well that Mr. Kumar was talking 
about, which is if you look at the guidance and regulation that 
has come out from the government to the asset owners, about 95 
percent of it is preventative--patch passwords, access 
management, and so forth. That leaves very little for 
visibility, detection, response, recovery.
    Senator King. That is what is concerning me. We may have 
already lost this battle in some sense.
    Mr. Lee. If they are not already, I mean, they have tried 
multiple times--not to be too flippant--but if they are not 
already in key parts of it, I don't think they are doing their 
job very well.
    Senator King. Mr. Kumar, your thoughts about the existence 
of, I call them sleeper cells, but you understand what I mean.
    Mr. Kumar. So Senator, as Mr. Lee was mentioning, we need 
to invest in detection of adversaries. We need to be able to 
see them. So how do we know that they are already there, and we 
may not know? And how do we get that awareness? So one of the 
big focus areas for us over the last year has been that we need 
to deploy sensor technologies. This was a White House-led 
initiative to say we need more visibility in our energy sector 
networks and we need to get sensors to do that. And if we see 
something that is anomalous in those networks, we need to be 
able to connect those dots and say, well, why did that 
malfunction happen versus was it just a technical failure, or 
was it something more malicious? We don't know that and we need 
to get that visibility, sir.
    Senator King. Well, I want to ask another question about a 
gap in our defenses. Is the NSA allowed to work with you on 
determining what is going on in the grid systems?
    Mr. Kumar. Senator, we have a fantastic relationship with 
our colleagues at the NSA. DOE, as a member of the intelligence 
community, has a robust Office of Intelligence and 
Counterintelligence, and we have a robust relationship through 
them with the entire intelligence community, including the NSA.
    Senator King. Well, that is important, because we have 
amazing capabilities throughout the government. The question is 
whether you can access them or whether TSA can access them or 
FERC. That is what worries me is that we can have a falling-
between-the-cracks phenomenon.
    Mr. Kumar. Senator, we are actively working with them. They 
are a great partner.
    Senator King. Thank you. Thank you all very much. Thanks 
for appearing.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Barrasso [presiding]. Senator Cantwell.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I would like to talk about the vulnerabilities on our 
nation's natural gas pipelines--maybe someday, too, hydrogen 
pipelines, but the Colonial Pipeline attack that occurred last 
spring was definitely a wakeup call. And after Colonial 
Pipeline and the Texas big freeze event, it became clear that 
we need to do more to ensure reliability of the bulk power 
system without--you have to do both. You have to have the whole 
system.
    So I would like to get the witnesses' views on the bulk 
electricity system and energy pipeline system. I want to work 
with the Chairman, Senator Manchin, and others--Senator 
Barrasso and members of the Committee. When Chair Chatterjee at 
FERC was there, we needed reliability and cybersecurity 
standards for pipelines. And with the help of NERC and FERC, we 
have improved that, but I believe that we need standards that 
work well and will be around for a long time. So I want to work 
with the Committee and the Chairman and Ranking Member to 
introduce legislation that will give FERC this very clear role. 
I think that is what needs to be done in protecting our 
pipeline from cybersecurity attacks.
    So I would like to know what the witnesses think about 
that, and Mr. Swick, I also believe that fiber is one of the 
best antidotes to helping us here, and I have been working with 
Senator Capito and others on the cost share of building out 
fiber capacity for our nation's grid, legislation that has been 
supported by EEI and the National Rural Co-op Association, 
Washington utilities, but I know that AEP has been a strong 
leader in national grid fiber, and wanted to see if you could 
add in with your comments as to why that makes sense as it 
relates to helping build a better, secure grid. So maybe we 
will start with you and then go down.
    Mr. Swick. Yes, ma'am.
    We will start with the fiber question. It was the last one. 
AEP has invested significantly in fiber and so, alternative, 
private fiber, or private communications, I think, there is 
absolute value in it. AEP has been investing for years and has 
one of the largest private fiber networks. So we see the value 
in it for us as well as potentially for others. So I think that 
should be a continued focus, whether it is fiber or different 
wireless methods, I think there is value in that.
    Senator Cantwell. Well, how can fiber help us on the 
security side?
    Mr. Swick. So in our case, we have a private fiber network 
that we can penetration test. We can ensure it's a closed-loop 
system and we know what's on that network and who can touch 
that network and we manage that ourselves. So there are 
benefits to having visibility and control across, from end to 
end.
    Senator Cantwell. So a closed-loop network compared to 
where we are today, just compare what you think the threat 
level is.
    Mr. Swick. So I know that there is no Chinese made network 
equipment in our fiber network. So things like that, where I 
can see what's in there. I know what technologies are 
implemented. I know how it's designed and how it's implemented 
versus, you get to the public internet, there are things on the 
big carriers that I don't have the visibility into, a lot of 
them are extremely good at what they do, but I don't have that 
visibility or----
    Senator Cantwell. The closed-loop network increases greatly 
our cybersecurity capacity as a nation.
    Mr. Swick. I believe it does, and AEP does. With our 
investment, that continues.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    And to the FERC role in pipelines.
    Mr. Swick. The electric industry has been regulated and has 
had cyber regulations for well over a decade. Gas pipeline--
which we significantly rely on, as Senator King referenced for 
New England and other areas--we need that gas pipeline to be 
just as reliable as the electric grid. So now we have got 
regulations and a lot of pressure on the gas pipelines, but it 
should be standardized. And if FERC can lead that, then I think 
they will line up well and we can have the same progress for 
both industries, and we do work closely together with the gas 
pipeline industry, but similar regulators--there would be 
benefit, I believe.
    Senator Cantwell. Well, I have legislation to do just that, 
but Mr. Lee and Mr. Kumar, do you think that is a good idea?
    Mr. Lee. Yes, very quickly, Senator, I would say that FERC 
is a very logical choice. I don't really particularly care 
which one takes it so long as it is one. When TSA rolled out 
the regulations, no offense to them, but it was massively 
rushed, like a 24-hour heads-up, no understanding of why we 
were doing it, what we were supposed to accomplish, only how to 
operate our systems. If you would have followed the original 
TSA SD-02 guidance to a tee, you would have taken down 
pipelines in this country. TSA SD-02C is a lot better and they 
have worked very hard. So who takes it? Don't really care. 
Somebody needs to and actually standardize instead of having 
competing requirements.
    On the discussion from closed-loop fiber, absolutely where 
it is feasible, but I think the broader point to make is, there 
are lots of different options, and people in the electric 
system know how to have a secure electric system. But we have 
got payment discussions and policy discussions around how to 
actually do that, and we are operating the electric system 
today in this country in a way it was never designed, in a way 
that is rapidly changing--changing energy portfolio and so 
forth. That is just adding immense complexity, and then cyber. 
And so, we have to address it completely, otherwise, we will 
take our own system down.
    Mr. Kumar. Senator, on your question regarding pipeline 
cybersecurity, I could not agree more in terms of the 
interdependency between electricity and natural gas. We need to 
ensure that the pipelines--and I would even extend it to the 
broader oil and natural gas sector--we need to really up our 
cybersecurity defenses across the country. And so, in this 
case, TSA certainly has that authority currently to do that, 
and I was glad to see the requirements that were put out for 
the pipelines. And we are happy to work with the Committee 
moving forward on how we would like to do that going forward.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks so very much.
    I just have a couple of additional questions, and then I 
don't know, Senator King, if you do as well.
    First, Mr. Lee, the Air Force's former chief software 
officer said last year that the United States would not stand, 
``a fighting chance if China and Russia combine their cyber 
warfare capabilities against the United States.'' Do you 
believe that cooperation between these two regimes could put 
our critical energy infrastructure in even further damage?
    Mr. Lee. Thank you, Senator.
    As a prior Air Force officer and NSA veteran, I would never 
count America out. That being said, yes, it poses a real risk. 
China and Russia are explicitly two that have continued to try, 
and sometimes have been successful in compromising our energy 
system. Working together, they would absolutely pose 
significant risk, and the predominance of cybersecurity is done 
in the private sector, not by the government for private sector 
entities, and we absolutely need to make sure the resources and 
policies are aligned to go against that kind of threat.
    Senator Barrasso. Anyone else on the panel want to comment 
on that?
    Mr. Kumar. Senator Barrasso, you know, we need to be 
thinking about both of those countries. They are highly capable 
adversaries and we need to make sure that we are defending our 
networks with the threat that is looming from Russia and China.
    Senator Barrasso. Anything additional, Mr. Swick?
    Mr. Swick. No, nothing to add, good comments.
    Senator Barrasso. Senator Manchin had to go to another 
committee hearing. He wanted to make a statement and then a 
question.
    Pipeline cybersecurity is overseen by the Transportation 
Security Administration, the TSA Service Operations Division, 
while FERC and NERC oversee electric grid cybersecurity. After 
the cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline in 2021, the TSA 
issued some mandatory pipeline cybersecurity standards for the 
first time. And so the question is, Mr. Kumar, what are 
Department of Energy's thoughts on TSA's new pipeline 
standards? And how does the Department of Energy coordinate 
with TSA to promote energy cybersecurity?
    Mr. Kumar. Senator, thank you for that question.
    So we at the Department actually co-chair what is called 
the Oil and Natural Gas Subsector Coordinating Council. That is 
the meeting where we bring together oil and natural gas 
companies from across the country with government agencies, 
including DOE and DHS as the co-chairs. TSA, PHMSA, and other 
agencies participate in that, and the focused area of that is 
security and resilience. And so we provide classified threat 
briefings to these companies.
    Now, in terms of your specific question regarding the 
security directives, the current version of the security 
directives are a much better representation of things that the 
pipeline companies should be doing. And so we are glad to 
partner with TSA in terms of ensuring that actually happens.
    Senator Barrasso. And then, finally, Mr. Lee, as someone 
who provides cybersecurity services for pipeline companies, 
what are your views on TSA's program?
    Mr. Lee. Yes, as Mr. Kumar stated, the current version is 
directionally accurate. The previous version, again, was 
something that would not have actually increased security very 
much at all, but would have increased the risk of the pipeline 
significantly. I would just simply state that as we look at 
these standards going forward, it is never a bad idea to talk 
to the regulated about what we are going to do before you 
introduce regulation.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, thank you all.
    Senator King, you would admit, this is a terrific panel 
that really knew their stuff. Great bipartisan agreement in 
needing to do more.
     So thank you again to the witnesses.
    Members will have until the close of business tomorrow to 
submit additional questions for the record, and I expect, Mr. 
Kumar, you will be getting some from Senator Hawley.
    The Committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:25 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
