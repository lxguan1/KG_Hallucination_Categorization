                              ----------                              


                        TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
                 Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:00 a.m. in 
Room SD-366, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Maria 
Cantwell presiding.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    Senator Cantwell. The U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources will come to order. I am obviously filling in 
for Chairman Manchin this morning, who expects to be here later 
today.
    I want to thank Chief Moore for being here today. In the 
last 18 months, Congress has provided you with a more than a 
quarter of a billion dollar increase in annual appropriations, 
an additional $5.4 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
funds, and an additional $5 billion in funding from the 
Inflation Reduction Act. These are timely and vital 
investments. In February, the President's Council of Advisors 
on Science and Technology issued a report to the President 
noting that more than 100 million Americans now live in areas 
that are threatened by wildfires. And as the Government 
Accountability Office noted last week, between January and 
October of last year, nearly 60,000 wildfires affected 7.2 
million acres of land. GAO noted that the length of the fire 
season and frequency of fires are increasing, while more people 
and infrastructure are at risk from these wildfires.
    Chief Moore, I know you are excited to discuss the proposed 
budget and how to meet those challenges. We, too, want to 
discuss those priorities because fire season is fast 
approaching. While I am relieved to see that the National 
Interagency Fire Center has not yet predicted a dangerous fire 
season for the West, an area facing significant wildfire risk 
is the Central Washington part of our state. This is home to a 
very highly productive agricultural part of our state, and I 
want to better understand how the Forest Service is going to 
help rural communities in Central Washington prevent and 
protect and recover from wildfire season.
    As we consider the Forest Service budget today, it is 
important to discuss how the Forest Service is spending 
historic investments made last Congress and how additional 
funding the Administration is seeking would bolster our 
investments. I would like to start by commending you on the 
legislative proposal included in your budget to address a 
number of the problems facing wildland firefighters. I 
appreciate your setting up a new pay table for these workers, 
building off the successes of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
and your stated desire to hire 970 more men and women to fill 
these roles. As we work through this, I do want to make sure 
that we are cognizant of what funding it is going to take to 
make these proposals a reality.
    I am told there is not a lot of cushion in the wildfire 
contingency reserve that we enacted five years ago as part of 
the fire borrowing fix, and as everyone knows, we wanted to 
quit borrowing from the fund and actually do the work that 
would help us prevent some of the fires from being at that 
catastrophic level. I was commenting to Senator Barrasso and 
thanking him for him coming to Seattle and us having a 
subcommittee hearing on wildland firefighting then, after we 
had seen devastating fires in the same Central Washington part 
of our state. And so these are very, very important issues. 
Senators Wyden, Risch, and I, along with others, worked hard to 
successfully end the practice of fire borrowing, and we must 
ensure that the Forest Service does not return to that practice 
of robbing non-fire accounts to cover fire costs.
    Lastly, I was surprised and disappointed to see that your 
proposal did not include anything with regard to your 
requirements under the Dingell Act to provide firefighters with 
the best technology for fighting fires and keeping firefighters 
safe. The Dingell Act, which required Forest Service to equip 
firefighters with technologies that are meant to prove safety--
I see nothing with regard to this requirement in the Forest 
Service proposal. So we will have a chance to ask in the Q&A 
about that.
    I would like to acknowledge a few other components of your 
budget proposal that are important to my state. For example, I 
appreciate this year's budget establishment of a permanent 
program to fund rehabilitation work after wildfires. The Burned 
Area Emergency Response Program will be able to provide more 
resources to areas impacted by wildfire, like those impacted by 
the Bolt Creek Fire that shut down Highway 2 in Washington last 
year after the fire burned the mountain slope just above the 
highway. These are really important areas for keeping 
communities operating, and in this case, a very vital link 
between the east and west part of our state, open and moving.
    I also appreciate the discussion in your budget about the 
inventory--the old-growth stands on the national forest. Your 
proposed investment in outdoor recreation funding is historic. 
Outdoor recreation employs over 114,000 people in the State of 
Washington. And according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, 
this sector grew by 8.7 percent over the last year. So we love 
the outdoor economy. It is continuing to grow. And we are 
working with our colleagues to try to very specifically focus 
on trail funding. But we are still falling short of what we 
need to do because these are mini family day trips, mini 
backpacking adventures that many people come to Washington for 
and many people in Washington want to enjoy.
    So with that, there is a lot to talk about in the Q&A and a 
lot to hear from our witnesses on.
    I will now turn it over to the Ranking Member, Senator 
Barrasso, for his opening remarks.
    And thanks again for your long-stead interest in these 
issues and paying attention to them and being willing to come 
to Washington after one of our big, big fire seasons.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING

    Senator Barrasso. Well, thank you very much, Madam 
Chairman. Thank you for today's hearing on the Forest Service 
budget request. Chief Moore, welcome back to the Committee. 
Glad to have you here today. We are looking forward to hearing 
how the proposed budget intends to further the critical mission 
of the agency.
    I am pleased with some of your priorities within the budget 
request. For example, there is funding to protect our forests 
from catastrophic fire, as the Chairman just said. Providing 
badly needed pay increases to our brave firefighters. We have a 
number of them here with us today. I also do have some 
significant concerns.
    In the last two years, Congress has provided over $10 
billion additional dollars to the Forest Service. The budget 
proposes massive increases in new spending. You know, your 
request for $7.4 billion in discretionary appropriations would 
amount to a 52 percent increase over current funding levels. In 
an era of historic budget deficits, the Forest Service really 
needs to prioritize.
    To be clear, the Forest Service faces enormous challenges 
in the fight against wildfires. One-third of our national 
forests are at serious risk of being consumed by catastrophic 
fires. There is broad agreement among members of this 
Committee, both sides of the aisle, that the historic forest 
fire treatment levels are historically and totally inadequate 
to meet the challenge. While I support robust funding for the 
efforts, I am not convinced that we can simply just spend our 
way out of problems that have plagued the forest for decades. 
The Forest Service needs to fully embrace efforts to streamline 
its processes for approving projects that improve forest 
health. The agency needs to more aggressively defend against 
harmful litigation that prevents projects from moving forward. 
Far too often, when extreme environmental groups sue, vital 
wildfire reduction projects get tied up in the courts and don't 
get accomplished.
    I am also deeply troubled by what appears to be the 
intentional exclusion of Wyoming from major Forest Service 
initiatives aimed at reducing wildfire risk. In its ten-year 
strategy to combat the wildfire crisis, the agency has 
announced significant spending across 21 designated areas. 
These dollars fund projects that are critical for reducing 
wildfire risk and defending America's forests. They are going 
to protect people's lives and livelihoods. Inexplicably, 
Wyoming is the only state located on or west of the Rocky 
Mountains that has not received funding under this strategy--
the only state--of all of those. Further, Wyoming is the only 
western state to be excluded from the Wildland Fire Mitigation 
and Management Commission. This is a commission created by 
Congress to help improve strategies to prevent, to manage, to 
suppress, and to recover from wildfires. That is why in March 
of last year, I, along with the rest of the Wyoming delegation, 
sent a letter specifically requesting that Wyoming be 
represented on the commission. Here we are a year later. 
Wyoming is still not represented. This is a pattern of neglect 
that simply must change.
    [The letter referred to follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Barrasso. Much like other western states, Wyoming 
is highly vulnerable to wildfires. According to the Forest 
Service estimates, more than four million acres of Wyoming 
forests are at either high or very high risk to catastrophic 
wildfires. And we have seen the tragic results of the failure 
to properly manage these acres. In four of the past five years, 
Wyoming has been hit by numerous destructive fires. In 2020 
alone, we experienced nearly 340,000 burned acres. Now, that is 
a land larger than a third of the entire area of the 
President's home State of Delaware. We are talking about a 
large area of land.
    Today, our communities remain in harm's way. According to 
the Forest Service website, wildfirerisk.org, towns in Wyoming, 
like Dubois, Jackson, Buffalo, Lander, and Saratoga are all at 
high risk to destructive wildfires. I believe the people of 
Wyoming deserve better protection. And at the very least, they 
deserve the same protections that every other western state is 
getting.
    Thanks so much, Madam Chairman. I look forward to the 
questioning and hearing today.
    Senator Cantwell. Chief Moore, welcome. Again, thank you 
for being here. We look forward to your testimony.

  STATEMENT OF RANDY MOORE, CHIEF, U.S. FOREST SERVICE, U.S. 
 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE; ACCOMPANIED BY MARK LICHTENSTEIN, 
  DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC PLANNING, BUDGET, AND ACCOUNTABILITY, 
                      U.S. FOREST SERVICE

    Mr. Moore. Thank you, and Chairwoman Cantwell, Ranking 
Member Barrasso, and members of the Committee, thank you for 
inviting me to testify before you today. I appreciate the 
opportunity to share how the Forest Service is putting 
America's money to work. The FY24 request focuses on three 
primary areas: modernizing the wildland fire management system, 
confronting the wildfire crisis, and ensuring equitable access 
to and benefits from the National Forest System.
    The people we serve deserve nothing less than to see the 
value of their money at work for their benefit. National 
forests and grasslands cover about 193 million acres, some 180 
million people, and over 68,000 communities, and they rely on 
these lands to capture and filter that drinking water. Our work 
contributes to over 373,000 jobs and $40.3 billion to the GDP. 
We work with tribes, states, and local governments, private 
landowners, and many other partners across the country to keep 
forests and grasslands healthy and safe. Today, America's 
forests face dire threats from wildfire, climate change, and 
insects and disease, especially in the West. This is an 
emergency situation in many places and we are acting with a 
sense of urgency in collaboration with communities and our 
partners. Our top priority is to reduce the wildfire threats by 
safeguarding communities and critical infrastructure and create 
a healthy, resilient forest.
    Through our wildfire crisis strategy, we have ramped up to 
treat the right places at the right scale using an all-hands, 
all-lands approach. This past January, we announced investments 
of $930 million in 21 high-risk landscapes in the West, 
benefiting roughly 200 communities and many other resources 
that people value. In addition to this, we have awarded nearly 
$200 million in Community Wildfire Defense Grants toward 100 
projects to 22 states and seven tribes, including to the 
Crooked Creek Community Fuels Mitigation Project in Wyoming. 
Recent investments by Congress give us a historic opportunity 
to take bold and strategic action. We are working to do just 
that, to put every dollar to good use.
    We are grateful to Congress, and this Committee in 
particular, for investing foundational funding to do this work. 
Sustained execution depends on continued federal investments. 
The proposed FY24 budget responds to this need. This budget 
also calls for a $1.4 billion investment in salaries, health, 
safety, and well-being for firefighters. A suite of new actions 
will permanently increase pay, improve options for housing, and 
provide better care and support for physical and mental health. 
It also increases the number of firefighters.
    While firefighters represent the backbone of our wildfire 
system, we also need active and aggressive land management to 
confront the wildfire crisis. This budget invests $300 million 
in hazardous fuels treatments. It supports execution of the 
wildfire crisis strategy. It targets investments in burned area 
rehabilitation for $56 million to expedite recovery from 
wildfire. It supports use of the latest research and grants to 
universities to support educational and technical assistance 
for innovative wood products, including a recent award to West 
Virginia University for the conceptual design of the first mass 
timber building using hardwood.
    National forests and grasslands belong to every American. 
We are grateful for the Great American Outdoors Act funds that 
helped to reduce our $7.7 billion maintenance backlog and 
ensure public access. Every person should feel a personal 
invitation and connection to these lands. We remain committed 
to removing barriers so all people can enjoy National Forest 
System lands and services, particularly tribal and underserved 
communities. We continue to focus policies, accountability, and 
training to ensure an equitable, respectful, and harassment-
free workforce. We know what's at stake if we don't address the 
effects of climate change and the wildfire crisis, the health 
of our forests and communities, clean water, a vibrant wood 
products industry, and jobs and resources that Americans depend 
on. We need to act now to meet the challenges before us.
    Thank you. I am grateful for your support, and I welcome 
your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Moore follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Mr. Lichtenstein, are you making a statement?
    Mr. Lichtenstein. No, ma'am.
    Senator Cantwell. Just here to take the hard questions.
    Mr. Lichtenstein. Yes, indeed.
    Senator Cantwell. Okay, all right.
    Well, let's get started.
    I wanted to start with this year's fire season question. 
The Forest Service has put out an announcement that might make 
most parts of Washington feel pretty good about what is 
happening, but the central part of our state, which is a very 
big Ag economy--$2 billion worth of agricultural products--
seems to be right in the epicenter of what people are saying 
will be the hot spot. You might put the whole map up for the 
rest of the U.S. Okay.
    [The map referred to follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Cantwell. So again, definitely, my colleague from 
Oregon, I am sure will show up and communicate about what this 
forecast is showing for Oregon, but you know, we have a very 
big apple, pears, hops, cherries, wine industry in this part of 
the United States. So we really want to know about your 
workforce and firefighting budget. Right now, firefighters have 
to work hundreds of hours of overtime, and how is your proposed 
increase going to help us address what we are facing here in 
the central part of Washington and in Oregon?
    Mr. Moore. So Chairwoman Cantwell, that was about three 
questions into one and so I will try to address them----
    Senator Cantwell. Well, I have three more.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Cantwell. Because I really want to ask you the 
inventory of old growth. I want to ask you why you have not 
implemented the technology, and definitely want to ask you 
about, you know, the trails issue. But for now, I am just, I am 
really giving you a softball, which is, you want more people. I 
am saying you want more people.
    By the way, I want to recognize that we have a bunch of 
firefighters here, particularly from the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie 
Forest. So thank you for being here. Thanks for what you guys--
I noticed when I talked about Bolt Creek, they were nodding 
because they know how bad that fire--literally caused a problem 
with shutting down Highway 2. So these are really integral day 
to day. So what can we do on the workforce side to make sure 
that we have the personnel here and ready to fight this fire 
season?
    Mr. Moore. Yes. Excellent question. So as we approach the 
busiest part of the fire year, 2023, for this year, the Forest 
Service is really aspiring to have about 11,300 firefighters on 
board. You know, we know that we need additional capacity, 
which is why we are requesting additional capacity in the FY24 
President's budget. And we are requesting funding for an 
additional 970 firefighters and support personnel. This really 
reinforces the need to enact pay, housing, mental health, and 
other reforms proposed in the FY24 President's budget to 
effectively recruit and retain wildland firefighters. Housing 
is a really big issue, and it is an issue of availability, but 
also affordability. And so we are working feverishly to work 
with Congress and we would be happy to follow up with you to 
look at some options that we are currently trying to explore, 
but to also look to see and work together on other options that 
we might want to pursue. But it is a significant issue, not 
only in recruitment of firefighters, but retention of 
firefighters.
    Senator Cantwell. Great. Well, I think what we would like, 
and maybe Mr. Lichtenstein can add some value to this and get 
us an answer, but I talked to my state and I am sure you have 
statistics about what we are seeing as an increase in fire 
season--the risk, the burn, the damage, the economic impact. 
And so I think we can put that into some sort of percentage, 
and if you say you don't have the workforce to combat it, this 
is how much more challenging it will be. And so I guess that is 
what we are looking for, but we will come back on that.
    On the Dingell Act, on the technology side, I noticed the 
President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology 
issued a report, ``Modernizing Wildland Firefighting To Protect 
Our Firefighters,'' and the President's Council's quote was 
that the report highlights ``immediate needs that can be 
addressed with existing technology, and strategic, long-term 
investments in new science and technology to ensure that our 
firefighters do not have to face tomorrow's fires with 
yesterday's tools. ''
    [The PCAST report referred to follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Cantwell. We passed the Dingell Act several years 
ago. So when are we going to have these new tools for 
firefighters this year on technology, on mapping, on 
communication?
    Mr. Moore. So Chairwoman Cantwell, we have deployed 
trackers in certain areas and we are working through the 
interoperability in other areas. We are also issuing and 
developing standards for their use. We will be deploying 
resource trackers on our fire and our fleet vehicles this year, 
this fiscal year, and we plan to operationalize the wildland 
Fire Factor trackers in 2024. We are also working with the 
Colorado Center of Excellence to develop team awareness kits 
that really provide a common operating picture for the crews as 
they work on these incidents.
    Senator Cantwell. Well, I can't emphasize enough how 
important this technology and information is. You may know we 
were very involved, particularly when it came to weather 
forecasting, because we, again--what turned into a deadly fire 
in the central part of the state, and a forecaster basically 
said, yes, go deploy people. The people in Seattle were 
definitely saying no, you should not have deployed people. The 
winds were that high. So we have to get the right information 
in the hands of people who are on the ground taking the risk. 
And so we will follow up with you and get even more specificity 
on what the resources may be that we need to make sure this is 
implemented.
    Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Thanks so much, Madam Chairman.
    Chief Moore, last month, I sent a letter to you along with 
Senator Lummis from Wyoming and Representative Hageman. We sent 
the letter to you as well as Secretary Vilsack. The letter 
details our concern over our home State of Wyoming's exclusion 
from the ten-year strategy to address the wildfire crisis. We 
have a map here. You see in bright red, those are the areas 
that are designated. We saw your map, Madam Chairman. These are 
the areas that have been designated for wildfire mitigation 
under the strategy that you have outlined.
    [The letter and map referred to follow:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Barrasso. Every state west of the Rocky Mountains 
has designated areas except the State of Wyoming. What is the 
rationale, when I have already outlined earlier how many acres 
have burned and the threats that we have in Wyoming and the 
places even on your own website where there are threats for 
Wyoming? Why in the world would Wyoming be excluded from these 
designations?
    Mr. Moore. So let me say up front, Senator, there is no 
reason I could give you that you would accept simply because 
Wyoming appears to be missing. I will say that we have other 
ways of working in Wyoming, and we are working in Wyoming in 
other ways through the collaboratives. You are getting quite a 
bit of funding there. We are also looking at wildland urban 
interface areas where we have had members from the different 
states and tribes evaluating the proposals. We had 100 
proposals for this work. And so, you know, this is the first 
round. We awarded a little over $200 million, but we have up to 
a billion dollars to award. So the fact that you don't have 
anything currently does not mean that you will not be getting 
anything in the future.
    But I will say too, though, that you are pointing out the 
need for us to continue in this effort that we are doing. And 
as much money as we are receiving, and we are very thankful to 
Congress for that, it is not enough to take care of the 
problems to the degree that we see them taking place, 
particularly across the West. So this down payment that we have 
through the bill's funding and the IRA funding is a good down 
payment and it is very much appreciated, but it is not enough 
to hit all of the areas out West. Our intent is to make sure 
that we don't leave Wyoming out in this picture that we are 
trying to create in terms of how we are responding to 
wildfires. And so, Senator, I would just say that, for right 
now, you did not get one of the 21 landscapes, but please 
understand that there is so much other work going on outside of 
the 21 landscapes where Wyoming is benefiting.
    Senator Barrasso. So is the Forest Service planning to 
designate areas in Wyoming in the future?
    Mr. Moore. I don't know, but we would certainly be happy to 
work with you as we take a look at what the possibilities are. 
And I can say with certainty that if there is another round of 
funding, that Wyoming would certainly be one of the landscapes 
that we would focus on.
    Senator Barrasso. You know, the first time we met it was to 
discuss the situation of the Black Hills National Forest. At 
the time, our local sawmills were teetering on the brink of 
collapse. Some actually ended up closing down or reducing their 
hours. This was due in large part to the Forest Service actions 
that dramatically lowered the timber harvest levels. Since our 
meeting, I have been encouraged by many of your actions to help 
address the dire situation, but still, there is a long way to 
go in order to ensure the long-term viability of the remaining 
sawmills. Your state partners in Wyoming and South Dakota 
really stand ready to help. How might your agency find ways to 
further leverage the good efforts the people of Wyoming and 
South Dakota are engaged in right now?
    Mr. Moore. So Senator, you know, we have been working 
really hard with the state agencies, as well as other partners, 
to really look at just the viability of the industry going 
forward. And while we are focusing on innovations moving into 
the future, we also have to look at retaining existing 
infrastructure. And so, we have a pilot project that the Black 
Hills is tied into where we are moving timber from one part of 
the country to other parts of the country to maintain its 
viability. And so, we will continue to do that. I am really 
pleased with the success and the progress that we have had to 
date on that project. And I would really like to encourage 
other parts of the country to look at this pilot program that 
we are working on between South Dakota, Wyoming, and 
California.
    Senator Barrasso. We are hoping that the agency could use 
its Good Neighbor Authority to allow states to help complete 
needed permitting reviews themselves, do it themselves without 
having to go further.
    Mr. Moore. We are certainly working toward that. In fact, 
we have 37 states where we have Good Neighbor Authority 
agreements in place.
    Senator Barrasso. Thanks, Madam Chairman.
    I have some questions for a second round.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Heinrich.
    Senator Heinrich. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
    And let me just start by saying this hearing is about the 
Forest Service's budget, and any budget is reflective of our 
values and our priorities. And if we believe that fuel 
treatments are critical, then we need to fund those projects. 
And I believe it is clear that not adequately funding this 
agency's budget will clearly result in more catastrophic 
wildfires. We can't have it both ways. Congress needs to step 
up and help you have the resources to address these issues.
    Now, Chief, as you know, northern New Mexico experienced 
the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon fire last spring. That was a 
prescribed fire run amok. It was the most devastating and 
largest fire in our state's history. We just passed the one-
year anniversary of that fire, and the communities in this area 
are still, in my opinion, in the very early stages of recovery. 
And that recovery is critical to rebuilding trust with the 
Service. One of the concerns that I am hearing about is whether 
last year's flood mitigation efforts on Forest Service land 
will be sufficient to keep downstream communities from 
flooding. So I want to ask you, one, are you confident that the 
work over the summer and the fall will be sufficient, and 
secondly, will the Forest Service continue mulching and seeding 
treatments this spring?
    Mr. Moore. Yes, Senator, let me first acknowledge the 
extraordinary impacts that these events have had on the people 
and the communities in New Mexico. I have personally gone out 
to tour the area, and the impacts have been really devastating 
in many of the communities that you serve, and that we serve, 
in general. The Forest Service and USDA, in general, is 
actively working with the state and FEMA to monitor the results 
of our treatments that we put in place last year and also to 
look at what the potential risks are for flooding and how the 
work that we have done last year might be affected. So we are 
working on a joint project--joint mitigation response--and we 
have a team that is in place to monitor the impacts that this 
spring's runoff would have on that work that was done.
    Senator Heinrich. Are you planning on additional mulching 
and seeding treatments this spring?
    Mr. Moore. Yes, let me say also that the work that we did 
last year and the funding that we received to do that work last 
year, we did complete that work. And so, as I said, now what we 
need to do is monitor the effectiveness of the work that we 
did. Going forward, particularly looking at the supplemental 
funding, that will allow us to fund more work in the coming 
years, depending on how----
    Senator Heinrich. So for places where it is found not to be 
effective, you will go in and do more?
    Mr. Moore. Well, what it does is, it gives us a long-term 
option to repair the damage from the fires. The supplemental 
dollars are really useful, but they are not necessarily timely, 
and that is the issue--we are trying to get the emergency 
disaster work done in a timely manner before the spring storms 
hit so that we can hold this is place, but we are pretty 
optimistic so far on the work. The communities have really just 
gone above and beyond working with us and FDA in general----
    Senator Heinrich. No question.
    Mr. Moore [continuing]. In terms of the state setting aside 
funding to supplement what the feds are doing. The communities 
are coming out, developing community groups to work with us and 
to help point us in the right direction. And one of the impacts 
that we have seen, and I may get the pronunciation wrong being 
from the south, but the acequias----
    Senator Heinrich. Pretty close.
    Mr. Moore [continuing]. That have been damaged 
significantly.
    Senator Heinrich. Yes.
    Mr. Moore. Through a lot of fire.
    Senator Heinrich. Sedimentation.
    Mr. Moore. That was in the uplands.
    Senator Heinrich. Yes.
    Mr. Moore. So we toured those areas and we do think it is a 
tragic situation and we are committed, Senator, to trying to 
replace the resources damaged through that fire.
    Senator Heinrich. If resources are an issue, I want to hear 
from you, Chief, because the only way we are going to rebuild 
trust is to make sure that we see this through for the long 
term.
    It has been almost three years ago now that Congress passed 
the Great American Outdoors Act, and that made the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund funding permanent. Now that funding 
through LWCF is guaranteed and is predictable, how quickly is 
the Forest Service able to move to closing on projects, and in 
particular, for 2021 and 2022, how much of the Forest Service's 
land acquisition budget from LWCF has actually gone out the 
door versus projects that are still in the closing process?
    Mr. Moore. So let me say going into this though that, you 
know, our processes served us well in the past, and what I am 
finding more often than not, is that the processes that we are 
using need to be streamlined. And you take the situation that 
you just mentioned--right now it is taking about three years. 
The process is complicated, so that's no mistake about that, 
but we are looking at our policies to streamlining approaches 
to really work to streamline that because we are seeing where 
other entities can get this done in a much quicker fashion. And 
so, the logical question is, then, why can't we?
    And so we are interested in working with you to see if we 
can't work quicker on these areas. But Senator, we are 
committed to streamlining as much as we possibly can, like we 
have done in other areas so far because we do want to meet 
Congress's intent when they allocate monies to us. And we do 
want to show that we are a good place to make an investment.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Senator Daines.
    Senator Daines. Senator Cantwell, thank you.
    Wildfires are already burning. They are currently burning 
in the southern and southwest areas of the country. I think 
over 300,000 acres have already burned. And while this is 
occurring, needed forest management work that will decrease the 
risk of catastrophic wildfires is delayed across the West by 
litigation. In fact, in Montana alone, there are over 300 
million board-feet tied up by litigation. If we are serious 
about maintaining healthy forests and ending the cycle of these 
catastrophic wildfires that we see every summer, we must, 
number one--cut red tape to speed up the NEPA process. You 
talked about the process and how long it takes just now, Chief. 
Two--empower states, empower counties, and empower our tribes 
to better manage our national forests through partnerships like 
the Good Neighbor Authority. And three--continue to hold the 
Forest Service accountable for commitments they make. So Chief 
Moore, thanks for being here today to discuss the Forest 
Service budget request.
    Back in 2018, Congress did pass a partial fix to the Ninth 
Circuit's Cottonwood decision, but this fix expired in March. 
In fact, it was exactly March 23, 2023. The Forest Service has 
testified that 87 forest plans--87--will have to immediately 
reinitiate consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service. And this consultation will take between five and ten 
years to finish, and it is going to cost tens of millions of 
dollars. How does the re-consultation requirement on these 87 
forest plans, Chief Moore, impact the Forest Service's ability 
to complete work on your ten-year wildfire strategy?
    Mr. Moore. Well, Senator, first, thank you for your help 
and support on this issue. I think it almost goes without 
saying that if we have to divert a lot of our resources and 
attention to reconsulting at the plan level with, you know, 
Fish and Wildlife and others, that it is going to have an 
impact on what we are planning to do throughout this year. And 
the wildfire crisis strategy is our priority. Getting resources 
in for our firefighters, you know, you are looking at mental 
health. I mentioned earlier, all those things that we are 
trying to do as well as hiring and retaining a lot of our 
firefighters, but also our workforce in general. That would be 
taking away from our ability to implement a lot of the things 
that we have planned for this year. So it would be a huge 
impact.
    Senator Daines. We were warning the folks up here on the 
Hill about the expiration. That is why we needed to get that 
Ninth Circuit Cottonwood fix passed because of this looming 
deadline that now expired last month. And now that it has 
expired, would you agree that a full and permanent Cottonwood 
solution should be a high priority and a bipartisan priority 
for this Congress?
    Mr. Moore. Yes, sir, I do.
    Senator Daines. Thanks. And I look forward to working with 
my colleagues and continuing to work with you to get this 
legislation across the finish line.
    In 2021, Congress provided the Forest Service with a new 
categorical exclusion for linear fuel breaks and a new 
emergency authority to expedite projects to avert or respond to 
catastrophic wildfires. The Forest Service reported using the 
linear fuel break authority, but only this year did Secretary 
Vilsack invoke the other new emergency authority across 250 
high-risk firesheds that the Forest Service has now identified. 
Twenty-three of these high-risk firesheds are in Montana and we 
split a 24th with Idaho. So it is important that this emergency 
authority be used to get management work done on the ground. My 
question, Chief Moore, is how many requests have you received 
from regions to use this new emergency authority, and how many 
of these have you approved, or what do you anticipate the 
timeline might be?
    Mr. Moore. So Senator, so far, we have had eight requests 
to come in. We have approved six of those.
    Senator Daines. And how many of these linear fuel breaks 
categorical exclusions have they actually used and in which 
regions?
    Mr. Moore. Well, so, for context, let me say in general, 
you know, right now about 85 percent of our projects use 
categorical exclusion. And if you want to know in terms of a 
number, that is about 4,000 CEs per year that we are using, on 
average, and that is a pretty significant increase from a few 
years ago. So we are looking at streamlining. We are looking at 
using the appropriate tool depending on the situation out on 
that landscape. We are looking to continue trying to streamline 
our processes. I mentioned that earlier. That is one of my 
priorities, is to look at where we can streamline our processes 
to really get the work done at that ground level rather than 
spending so much time planning.
    Senator Daines. Yes.
    Mr. Moore. I think we have a pretty good bead on planning. 
We see where we have some opportunities to decrease the amount 
of time that we are spending on that and we are also seeing 
productivity increasing out in the field when we are able to do 
that.
    Senator Daines. Thank you, Chief Moore.
    Senator Cantwell, thank you.
    I look forward to working with you on that Ninth Circuit 
Cottonwood fix. Talk about streamlining, it is adding five to 
ten years, and there is no time right now. But that is a golden 
opportunity for us to take advantage of right now in this 
Congress. I hope we can do it and help you on that.
    Thank you.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Senator Hirono.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chief Moore, it is good to see you again. I appreciate your 
attentiveness to Hawaii and the Pacific region and note that 
state natural resource managers back home tell me that they 
have a good working relationship with the Forest Service. We 
are always looking for new opportunities to strengthen those 
relationships, one of which is through potentially establishing 
a national forest in Hawaii. As the bill requiring the study 
was signed into law late last year, can you provide an update 
on where the Forest Service is in conducting the study, and 
going forward can you provide me with quarterly updates on the 
study?
    Mr. Moore. Sure. So we expect a contract out and completion 
of the study within the next 90 days. And I do think quarterly 
updates would be logical and practical, but Senator, also know 
that any time you would like to have an update, we would be 
happy to provide you with one.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you very much.
    The use of natural infrastructure is becoming an 
increasingly popular and effective alternative to more 
traditional gray infrastructure solutions throughout our 
country. I currently have a bill that directs the Forest 
Service and U.S. Geological Survey to establish a joint natural 
infrastructure science program that would work with colleges 
and universities to supply the necessary research on natural 
infrastructure solutions. Can you discuss in general the Forest 
Service's experience with using natural infrastructure and the 
role you see it playing in future projects?
    Mr. Moore. So this is a critical piece that we should be 
looking at, and I think there is a critical role for natural 
infrastructure protecting and sustaining, particularly, source 
watersheds, as we talk about. The research topics, which our 
Forest Service scientists and collaborators can primarily 
address, are those involving wood building materials and the 
use of wood to enhance other building material.
    Senator Hirono. So would you support the establishment of a 
joint natural infrastructure science program, because I find 
that working with universities, or, in fact, even with students 
in high school and in earlier grades where they are exposed to 
these kinds of methods, really plays a big part in our 
contending with the changes that, you know--the need to protect 
our environment. So would you support such a science program?
    Mr. Moore. Yes, of course I would, Senator.
    Senator Hirono. Okay.
    There is also broad interest in establishing a climate hub 
in Hawaii to promote more localized tools and resources in the 
Pacific region, and of course, the lessons learned in Hawaii 
through the creation of such a hub would have applicability to 
island nations throughout the Pacific because we are contending 
with the impact of climate change. So additional funding is 
needed to make such a hub a reality, as identified in the 
Agricultural Research Service's FY24 budget request, and I am 
currently working with my colleagues to secure that funding. 
Can you discuss the role that climate hubs play in helping 
producers and land managers adapt to climate change, and do you 
expect stakeholder demand for these hubs to increase in the 
future?
    Mr. Moore. I do expect for the demand to increase in the 
future. One of the examples from a USDA Southwest Climate Hub 
hearing is the Pacific Drought Knowledge Exchange website. This 
enables collaborative relationships, you know, among drought 
stakeholders in Hawaii and the Pacific Island nations. And it 
also provides clear factual information for educational 
purposes, staff training, and also community outreach.
    Senator Hirono. So these hubs work to bring, I think, 
focused attention on that kind of work, and I hope that you 
will support our efforts to fund such a hub in Hawaii.
    Mr. Moore. Yes.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Senator Cortez Masto.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chief Moore, it is good to see you again. Thank you for 
being here.
    Mr. Moore. It is good to see you.
    Senator Cortez Masto. I don't think you had a choice, but 
thank you.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Cortez Masto. Let me start, because you talked a 
little, and you have been hearing about this. Our fire seasons 
have become a year-round reality, as you have heard, 
particularly in the West and in Nevada as well, threatening 
lives, property, and small businesses. It is critical now more 
than ever that we provide our firefighters with the support and 
tools they need to combat these wildfires that are hotter and 
longer as we see happening. Accordingly, the Forest Service's 
FY24 budget request notes your agency's intent to build on the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which you talked about today, as 
well as last year's budget request, to enhance compensation for 
our wildland firefighters. Every time I meet with our local 
firefighters in Nevada, they express their concerns to me about 
the ability to recruit, to train, and retain their workforce. 
Salaries, benefits, and housing--you talked a little bit about 
that--are strong components that obviously need greater 
attention.
    So can you please provide me with an update on these 
previously appropriated funds, and tell us how firefighters are 
seeing the benefits of increased funding for wildland 
firefighter compensation?
    Mr. Moore. Thank you, Senator. To date, everything that the 
firefighters are beginning to see is temporary. The FY24 budget 
is proposed to make these permanent shifts. In the permanent 
shifts, it's looking at pay, it's looking at housing, and it's 
looking at mental care and well-being. And it also would make 
these pieces permanent. So we are hopeful that this budget will 
pass as is.
    And it's no secret that we have had a recruitment and 
retention problem, even last year when we were trying to hire 
up to 11,300 firefighters, we had a lot of issues. And it's 
geographic in nature in many cases, but in my experience, 
particularly coming out of California, you know, you had other 
entities paying two and sometimes three times the salaries that 
the Forest Service and the Federal Government, really, was 
paying our firefighters. And these are people that are at the 
low end of the pay scale that are really on the ground, sucking 
smoke and dirt for most of the time that they are on this fire. 
And you know, there is no way that I could ever be okay with 
what we pay our firefighters and not push, with everything I 
have to try and have more of an equitable program and that the 
wildland firefighters in the Forest Service are well paid, they 
are well cared for. We are looking out at the communities that 
we serve and protect, but they can't afford to live in those 
communities that we serve and protect.
    Senator Cortez Masto. So Chief, can I--because I have only 
got a few minutes. So your goal is, with this fiscal year 
budget, to make sure that you are increasing that compensation, 
those benefits, and making that permanent. That's one, correct?
    And then you talked about housing and mental health, which 
are areas that I also want to focus on. What are you 
specifically doing about the housing issue, and how can we 
help?
    Mr. Moore. So we have put together a team, a national team 
to really look at the housing issue. And we are piloting in 
some areas. The White River National Forest in Colorado is one 
of the areas where we are piloting a long-term program where we 
are working with the communities to build houses for our 
firefighters in exchange for the land. We are very optimistic 
about that. We are also looking at other areas across the 
country where we can engage the community into helping us find 
a solution to this problem because the communities benefit as 
much as anyone in maintaining a firefighter's support into 
their communities.
    Senator Cortez Masto. So when you say, ``in exchange for 
the land,'' meaning what, that it is already federal land and 
you want it cheaply or----
    Mr. Moore. We would lease the land to them for, I believe 
in this case, it was 50 years or 100 years.
    Senator Cortez Masto. It is federal land that you would 
lease back at a low rate?
    Mr. Moore. Yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Or no rate to help affordable 
housing?
    Mr. Moore. Yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Okay.
    Mental health--what efforts are you taking to turn that 
conversation that I know you had earlier this month--the Forest 
Service and the Interior Department held a summit to develop 
mental health resources for fire personnel--now, how are you 
turning that conversation into action?
    Mr. Moore. So we just started that. In fact, last week, 
Secretary Vilsack, as well as Secretary Haaland, presented at 
this meeting that we had in Idaho. We also had a number of 
firefighting personnel that were present there as well. And at 
that meeting, we talked about the need for support for mental 
health care and well-being. And Senator, I have to tell you 
that in my career, I have seen the underbelly of what can 
happen when things don't work out right. And I am deeply 
committed to trying to provide that mental care and well-being, 
both trauma care as well as when things go wrong, because it 
leaves a hole in not only the person, but that person's family 
and the colleagues that they work with. I have scars from that 
myself, and because of the scars that I have and what I have 
seen, I am deeply committed to trying to provide this necessary 
service to our firefighters and our----
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. And I know my time is up, 
but this is essential, not just the compensation and the 
benefits are key here, but also the housing and the mental 
health.
    Mr. Moore. Yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. So I would hope you would come back 
to us to figure out how we can continue to work together on all 
three of those areas, but at least you are talking about it and 
that is a key for us really addressing this issue. Now, let's 
turn it into action. So thank you, Chief Moore, I appreciate 
it.
    Mr. Moore. Thank you.
    The Chairman [presiding]. Senator Hickenlooper.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Chair, and I admire the 
new haircut, as someone who got, obviously, their hair cut on 
the same day, I think, kind of a----
    The Chairman. Just a change of pace.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Hickenlooper. Mutual admiration society.
    Mr. Moore, I appreciate all of your work. Nice to see you 
again. Obviously, outdoor recreation plays a large role in 
Colorado's economy. White River Forest, you have talked about 
several times, with 18 million visitors a year, more than 
22,000 jobs, $1.6 billion in economic impact. I think that, you 
know, there is a lot of discussion now of opening an office of 
outdoor recreation. Twenty-two different states have offices of 
outdoor recreation, most of them connected to their economic 
development arms. I think commerce might be able to create that 
office of outdoor recreation, but they would have to work very, 
very closely with the Forest Service. You are such a large 
part--you guys and the BLM as well. Is that something you are 
open to and willing to put in some resources and personnel to 
try and make sure that if and when this office of outdoor 
recreation gets stood up, that it can get the support, the 
interagency support, that it needs?
    Mr. Moore. Yes, and Senator, we would be happy--we always 
partner with communities and states in trying to really bring 
recognition to recreation and just the get outdoors type of a 
feel. You know, you said it, and it's true, outdoor recreation 
provides a lot of not only economic benefit to this country, 
but also a spiritual benefit as well, you know, when you are 
able to get out and recreate. What we have found since the 
pandemic is that we have a lot more visitors visiting the 
national forest. We have non-traditional visitors visiting the 
national forest as well. You know, when the museums were 
closed, they needed to find somewhere to go, and so they found 
the outdoors, the national forest as one of those examples.
    So looking at recreation in general, it has been 
underfunded for quite some time now. And as we focus more on 
recreation and just really providing that release for our 
American people, we really need to work with all of our 
partners to help find solutions for how they can get outdoors 
and enjoy the great outdoors.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right, and I could not agree more. 
Spiritual is a huge part of that value, and health, physical 
health as well. And in many countries, especially Scandinavian 
countries, they will, the doctor will prescribe, you know, 
three walks--three one-hour walks a week in forests to help 
someone's medical condition. So thank you for that. I think 
that is very exciting. And most states now have dedicated 
people toward trying to find more access points into the 
national forest. I know Colorado does. Hopefully, we can find 
some resources within your organization to get more parking 
lots and not have to spend 12 years doing a survey on that.
    The other point I wanted to talk about, you talked a little 
bit about the affordable housing, and the 50 and 100-year 
leases. And I think that is a place where all over the country 
we are seeing this pinch. And I love that the Forest Service is 
willing to be part of that at the 50 to 100-year leases. I know 
that sometimes it is hard to keep everybody at the table. In 
other words, I think that local communities, the counties, the 
municipalities, all have to step up and contribute what they 
can and make sure that the value that they are creating stays 
owned by the community. In other words, that it isn't a 30-year 
or a 20-year benefit that suddenly becomes private housing. And 
I know that sometimes that gets in the way of some of your 
rules and regulations. And I am hopeful that--I am sure you are 
aware of it--but that we can navigate that.
    Mr. Moore. Yes, we are finding that it is an increasingly 
difficult situation that we find ourselves in. And that is why, 
if there is a solution to be discovered in this, we need to do 
this with the communities. And I think we need to be willing 
to--everyone needs to put a little skin in the game, so to 
speak, so that we can find solutions because it is imperative 
that we have presence in these communities. In order to do 
that, we are going to need to be able to afford to live in 
these communities.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right, exactly. Great, well, thank 
you. I will yield back my 30 seconds remaining. That is, I 
think, the largest I have yielded back, not because I don't 
have a lot of questions, but the next question would take 20 
minutes.
    I have three other questions I will submit in writing.
    Thank you. I yield back to the Chair.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    I am going to go ahead and give my questions now.
    Chief Moore, in the last 18 months, you have received a 
more than a quarter of a billion dollar increase in annual 
appropriations. You had an additional $5.4 billion in the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. You have had an additional $5 
billion in the Inflation Reduction Act. And I would like to 
know how you have spent it or how you are going to spend it. 
This is the third hearing in a row where I am pointing out your 
agency's ignoring an essential requirement in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law--to perform work on the ten million acres 
that your agency previously identified as being the most 
dangerous and track your progress with specific performance 
measures. The Forest Service is continuing to ignore both parts 
of this requirement. The Forest Service is obligating hundreds 
of millions of dollars, but not in the places required by the 
law.
    So with regard to performance measures last year, NBC News 
showed the same acres being reported as treated by the Forest 
Service more than 30 times in four years. Both the GAO and the 
OIG have said the Forest Service's current measures are 
``misleading and inaccurate.'' The OIG noted in their report 
that Congress and Forest Service management run the risk of 
making funding prioritization decisions based on inaccurate 
information. I think I can speak for all of us that Congress 
would like to make its funding decisions based on more accurate 
information, not less accurate. We know we need more proactive 
management in our national forests to restore their health and 
address fire risk, but as senators responsible for oversight of 
your agency, on behalf of all of us as Americans, we demand 
accountability for funding that we have given you.
    So my question would be, do you intend to adhere to the 
requirement in the law?
    Mr. Moore. Senator, in my opinion, we are adhering to the 
law.
    The Chairman. You have not given us any reports at all.
    Mr. Moore. We'd be happy to give you any report. In fact, 
we are keeping weekly reports of what we are able to do and 
what we are able to get accomplished. So we would be happy to 
provide you----
    The Chairman. On the ten million acres that are most at 
risk?
    Mr. Moore. We can give you more than ten million acres, if 
that is what you wish.
    The Chairman. No, no, the law is very clear. Here is--I 
will read the law to you, sir, again. I mean, the treatment 
``of the federal land or Indian forest land or rangeland that 
has been identified as having a very high wildfire hazard 
potential, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of 
Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, 
shall, by not later than September 30, 2027, conduct 
restoration treatments and improve the Fire Regime Condition 
Class of ten million acres that are located in the wildland-
urban interface or a public drinking water source area.''
    Mr. Moore. So in the wildland public interface, we have 
just let a lot of the contract out to the tune of about $200 
million. And we actually pulled together tribal members and 
state members to look at the first hundred projects that came 
in for funding. So that has just been completed and we are 
looking at working on the second round of projects. We sent our 
proposal out. And I would ask all of your constituents to look 
at the notice of forest projects that is coming out so that you 
can compete for those projects.
    The Chairman. Do you have a point person that we can put 
our Committee staff on?
    Mr. Moore. Yes.
    The Chairman. Because we don't seem to be getting direct 
answers. We are getting a lot of run around from you all.
    Mr. Moore. Mark Lichtenstein would be the point person.
    The Chairman. Okay. I will have Bryan--he will be right 
with you, Okay?
    My second question: The Forest Service reported that last 
year it only sold 2.9 billion board-feet of timber, almost ten 
percent less than it sold two years ago, despite the $10.4 
billion appropriated above ever-increasing annual 
appropriations. We are producing less. I believe that many 
states are willing to share their staff and resources with you 
so they can help you carry out this work. Over the last four 
years, states have administered the sales for 1.1 billion 
board-feet of Forest Service timber under your Good Neighbor 
Authority and they have a proven track record of working. 
However, I understand that just $28 million of the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law funding has been allocated thus far for Good 
Neighbor Authority projects. So I would like the Forest Service 
to take advantage of the staff and resources that many states 
have to offer with you in conjunction.
    So what portion of the $10.4 billion that Congress has 
provided to the Forest Service do you envision the states 
helping you manage?
    Mr. Moore. So I can't answer that specifically, but what I 
can tell you though, to your earlier point, is that we have not 
produced less timber than we have in the past. In fact, we are 
producing more than we have in the last ten years. Now, we 
accomplished about 2.9 billion board-feet in 2022. And a part 
of the reason that we did not accomplish the 3 billion board-
feet that was our target is because of so many fires that had 
happened that burned through some of the timber sales. This 
year, in 2023, our plan is to produce 3.4 billion board-feet 
and we are on track to achieve that. And next year, that is 
going up to 3.5, and then we are working toward a 4 billion 
board-feet program. So we are, I think, being really productive 
in that arena.
    The other thing that I have done, Senator, for the 
accountability piece of it, I have given each region a target 
and we are tracking that target every quarter to see how we are 
doing in terms of meeting that target. I have just had our mid-
year reviews with all of our regional foresters. We are on 
target to achieve 3.4 billion. We may even go slightly over 
that.
    The Chairman. So basically, you are not in agreement with 
the ten-percent less than you sold two years ago? We have those 
numbers from your----
    Mr. Moore. I am not in agreement that we are producing less 
than we have in the recent past.
    The Chairman. Those numbers came from your request for your 
budget.
    Mr. Moore. No, we achieved 2.9 billion board-feet this past 
year, 2.9 billion.
    The Chairman. Last year.
    Mr. Moore. Yes, last year, in 2022, the fiscal year 2022.
    The Chairman. That was ten percent less than you did two 
years ago.
    Mr. Moore. Yes, and I am saying the reason we did not 
exceed that was because of the fires and the storms that took 
place across this country.
    The Chairman. All right.
    Senator King.
    Senator King. I am going to start on deferred maintenance 
and talk to Mr. Lichtenstein. You have submitted answers, or 
the Department submitted answers to questions a year ago that 
you have about $58 billion worth of capital assets. A rule of 
thumb is one to four percent of value of capital for 
maintenance. Yet, your budget this year is, I think, $100 
million. What gives? That's ridiculous. Are you expecting the 
Congress to bail you out every ten years with the Great 
American Outdoors Act? You have to stop digging the hole.
    Mr. Lichtenstein. No, sir. We do not expect you to bail us 
out every year. Recognizing that the cost of deferred 
maintenance continues to grow and the value----
    Senator King. So why isn't there more money in the budget 
for maintenance?
    Mr. Lichtenstein. There are always difficult decisions to 
make. We are always trying to stay ahead of our----
    Senator King. Yes, and the easiest one is deferred 
maintenance, but that is not really a cut. All it is, is a 
moving of the expense further into the future.
    Mr. Lichtenstein. Understood. I think we are in the same 
position as many other federal agencies in addressing our 
maintenance problems in terms of our overall asset inventory. 
So we are still working on analyzing our assets to make sure we 
are having the best assets available to meet those mission 
requirements.
    Senator King. Well, $100 million for a $58 billion asset 
base is an insult to the people of the United States. So I am 
hoping that the Administration could take this more seriously 
because, you know, the Great American Outdoors Act was a heavy 
lift around here.
    Mr. Lichtenstein. Indeed.
    Senator King. And it is not something that we are going to 
be able to do every two or three years, particularly to make 
the case to our colleagues that we need more funding for 
deferred maintenance when the deferred maintenance is getting 
worse and worse.
    Mr. Lichtenstein. And we do appreciate your work with the 
Great American Outdoors Act. It has made a significant impact 
on our ability to address those concerns.
    Senator King. Chief Moore, we were talking about harvest 
levels, 2.9 billion last year. I think in the 80s it was 
something like 13 billion. Isn't that correct?
    Mr. Moore. Yes, roughly 12 or so, yes.
    Senator King. So explain to me what is going on? I mean, 
one of the problems, I mean, the forest fire problem, of 
course, relates to climate and weather and drought and those 
kind of things, but it also relates to a lot of slash and dead 
wood and small diameter trees on the ground because of a lack 
of harvesting. How has harvesting fallen by a factor of five in 
the last 25 to 30 years?
    Mr. Moore. Yes, sir. If we go back, and you know, it is 
really taking a historical perspective of the Forest Service 
and how it was working in the 80s and even prior to the 80s. 
And I think as a country we were in a different place. I think 
in the 80s the Forest Service brought in a number of 
``ologists'' if you will, to really look at doing some analysis 
on the NEPA that was being planned for these projects. And a 
part of the reason is because we were harvesting timber without 
the appropriate consideration for the resources.
    Senator King. Do you think we were overharvesting?
    Mr. Moore. Well----
    Senator King. Is there any evidence? Are there any studies 
that indicate that? If there are, I hope you will supply them 
to the Committee.
    Mr. Moore. Well, you know, it's more complex than that, 
Senator. It's a combination of--not now--is that we did not and 
are not removing the amount of vegetation that we have on the 
landscape. And that is part of the problem we have with these 
fires now.
    Senator King. Well, that is what I just said. So why aren't 
you increasing the harvest?
    Mr. Moore. Well, we are trying----
    Senator King. Why is the harvest ten percent of what it 
was, no, not ten percent of it, 20 percent of what it was 30 
years ago?
    Mr. Moore. Not two years ago, sir. I say our problem is 
twofold, you know, we are out trying to remove the vegetation. 
We do the work that we need to lay out the timber sales and 
then fires sometimes roll through the planned timber sale 
areas. We also have storms that take place, whether it is in 
the south, the east or the west, that also blow down areas that 
we have already laid out for timber sales. So that gets in the 
way of some of this.
    Senator King. But a reduction from 13 to 2.9 is a huge 
reduction. We can talk about this more extensively. Perhaps we 
can meet together to talk about it. But the other piece that 
sort of relates to this is inventory analysis--knowing what we 
have got. Last year we worked very hard to get an extra $10 
million in the budget to do that. The current budget cuts that 
by $2 million. Wouldn't it be nice to know what it is we have? 
That is the starting point for knowing what harvest levels 
should be. Why are we cutting the budget for inventory 
analysis?
    Mr. Moore. Well, I am saying now we know what we want to 
do, getting up to about four billion board-feet, which we 
expect to reach by FY27.
    Senator King. Eisenhower retook Europe in 11 months. I am 
not sure we need to wait three or four years to decide how much 
wood we are going to cut.
    Mr. Moore. Well, we have to look at the infrastructure and 
our capacity and what our ability is. You know, over the last 
15 to 20 years, we have lost over 40 percent of our non-fire 
workforce. And so, if we are looking at building up the 
vegetation side of the house, we have to rebuild that 
infrastructure because it is missing. And so we are doing that, 
but we also are facing a lot of the problems that many others 
are facing. And I give you an example, last year we hired about 
3,400 new employees and we lost 2,600 through attrition. And 
so, while we are trying to add capacity, there are other things 
going on where we are losing people through attrition. And so, 
we are digging into why, but the bottom line, sir, is that we 
recognize, and the wildfire crisis strategy recognizes that we 
need to remove more vegetation off the land.
    Senator King. We agree on that. And I understand the 
workforce. I just came from an Armed Services hearing. Exactly 
the same problem in the defense industrial base. So workforce 
is a real problem everywhere, and I do understand that. And I 
am glad that you are moving forward on that front, but I do 
think that the combination of the fires and just the value that 
is being lost to the supply chain is significant. So I 
appreciate your testimony and your work and hope that we can 
continue to work together. Anything we can do to help on the 
workforce problem, you should let us know.
    Mr. Moore. So Senator, can I ask for your support in 
looking at wood innovations because when I look, you know----
    Senator King. One hundred percent. That is one of the most 
important things we need to do, things like CLT, for example. I 
am totally in, yes, sir.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Lee.
    Senator Lee. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Thanks to both of you for being here.
    Chief Moore, in 2018, the Weber Basin Water Conservancy 
District began planning with the NRCS to try to update 
infrastructure. The project would repair seven storage 
facilities that provide water to communities below them, 
downstream from them. Then in 2019, the same conservancy 
district began working with the Forest Service as a cooperating 
agency. Since then, they have needed two time request 
extensions and the agency is saying that it will likely need to 
do a full EIS instead of relying on the original EA. So Chief, 
I have read the applicable law. There is no need for an EIS 
here. There simply isn't. I will have my staff reach out to 
yours, but will you commit to emphasizing with your agency that 
expediency is key with this project, especially as it relates 
to community water?
    Mr. Moore. I will, Senator.
    Senator Lee. Thank you. I appreciate that.
    Now, we have seen for several decades a growing reluctance 
from land managers to permit authorized uses of federal land, 
often due to just minimal negative public feedback. And we have 
seen this with timber harvesting, certainly. We have seen it 
with mining, with grazing, and we have seen it with other 
activities as well. And we are also seeing it with recreation. 
Just this month, the Flagstaff Ranger District in Arizona 
canceled plans to issue seven new permits to commercial guides 
just because some people wrote in concerned about jeeps 
overrunning the area. But unfortunately, they completely missed 
the mark. The people who wrote in did not seem to be informed 
at all by the actual proposal, which included rock climbing, 
mountain biking, and birding guides.
    So what can we do to increase the resiliency of our 
district offices to ensure that would-be users of public land 
are not kept out by nimbyism, especially, in some cases, 
uninformed nimbyism?
    Mr. Moore. Yes, sir. I am not familiar with that particular 
case that you brought up, Senator, but I will certainly look 
into it and get back with you on that.
    Usually, in a case moving from an EA to an EIS, it is 
really around an issue of significance, and I don't know what 
that might be without looking into it.
    Senator Lee. Yes, if you take a look at 16 U.S.C. 
1133(d)(4), I think it's there, but my staff will touch base 
with yours to compare our arguments.
    Mr. Moore. Great.
    Senator Lee. And thank you for your commitment on that.
    Timber harvesting, I want to get back to that for a minute. 
I share concern expressed by others here today, and Senator 
King and I agree in a number of areas, and I think this is one 
of them. It is critical to managing our landscapes effectively 
and it plays a really important role in the economies of rural 
communities, especially where there are lands that you manage. 
Unfortunately, timber outputs are far below the Forest 
Service's allowable sales quantities. What steps do you think 
that the Forest Service needs to take in order to attain 
harvests at the allowable sales quantities or even probable 
sales quantities?
    Mr. Moore. Yes, Senator, there has been a lot of concern 
over the years with our ability to remove vegetation. Part of 
it is resources, both money and people, that we have not had. 
With the bill and IRA, we have an opportunity to really 
increase the amount of work that we are doing to remove 
vegetation because we have said that that is one of the primary 
causes of the fire situation--disease, and insects that we 
have, particularly across the West--is our inability to remove 
the amount of vegetation that is necessary in order to have 
positive effects on fire behavior. So our wildfire crisis 
strategy is really designed around removing vegetation, and 
that is why we want to emphasize wood innovations, because a 
lot of our traditional mills don't have the capability to use 
small-diameter, low-value material.
    So part of the bill monies have been used to retrofit some 
of our mills to be able to handle that. All of this to create 
new opportunities through things like, as was mentioned 
earlier, cross-laminated timber, biochar, biofuels, some of 
those types of things that we can begin to use. And we are 
seeing a lot of successes in both of these areas. And so we are 
really optimistic that we will be able to provide a lot more of 
the vegetation--our resources that we have not, in the past--
and we are still trying to build capacity. We are having unique 
agreements with counties and states to really get at adding 
capacity where county and state officials are helping us with 
timber sale layouts, marketing, and some of those types of 
things. And so, we are creating non-traditional partnerships 
with a lot of our folks at the local level. RC&D is another 
area where we are partnering with the resource conservation 
districts to do some of the NEPA work.
    So we are exploring that.
    Senator Lee. Thank you, Chief Moore. I see my time is 
expired, but I do want to thank you for your commitments on 
those, and I hope you will continue to look at them. I do think 
that we are onto something here about the timber harvesting. I 
think that if you do that right, it can help you with the 
wildfire problem. It can help you achieve balance when it comes 
to the stand density index, and if you mess up the stand 
density index, you are at greater risk for wildfires and it 
also tends to contribute to drought in states like mine. So 
thank you very much.
    Mr. Moore. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    It's your turn, I think.
    Senator Kelly.
    Senator Kelly. I am up, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
And Senator Lee, thank you, perfect lead-in to my question on 
timber harvesting as well and on 4FRI.
    In Arizona, the Four Forests Restoration Initiative is 
finally underway. It is getting into its implementation phase, 
and we are going to do this landscape-scale restoration of the 
biggest ponderosa pine forest on the planet. So what does the 
timeline for implementation look like, and are there any 
anticipated roadblocks? And if there are, what are we going to 
do to get ahead of them?
    Mr. Moore. So this year, 2023, Senator, the forest--and I 
say the forest, but it is the four forests that comprise 4FRI--
receives about $42 million from bill funding and they are 
currently implementing timber, fuels, roads, and bridge 
projects to support that land restoration project that we have 
been talking about earlier. Also included in that is about 
47,000 acres of mechanical thinning and we are putting a 
contract out this year. We also have, in addition to that, 
about 17,000 acres of hazardous fuel reduction, and we are also 
planning to do about 100,000 acres of prescribed burning to 
complement that.
    Senator Kelly. So you got the contracts on the 47,000 acres 
this year, and right now, my understanding is the 
infrastructure needed to do this work is currently underway.
    Mr. Moore. We believe so. We are constantly hiring 
personnel because that seemed to be one of our biggest 
challenges there on bringing people on with the experience 
level that we need at that journey level. And you know, it 
takes time to train them, but one of the ways that we are 
supplementing that is by developing unique partnerships with 
some of our county and state officials to provide some of that 
expertise to work for the common good between the state, feds, 
and local level.
    Senator Kelly. Okay, thank you.
    And since we are speaking of workforce, the firefighter 
compensation reform package included in the Forest Service FY24 
request aims to help the workforce for the wildland 
firefighters by increasing--let me say permanently--increasing 
their pay, improving mental health and physical health support, 
and expanding housing options. So Chief, if the proposed FY24 
firefighter compensation reform package is not passed in 
Congress in this session, what would be the impact on the 
wildland firefighter workforce, and what would you have to do 
to mitigate for the downside of this?
    Mr. Moore. Yes, excellent question, with a disaster of an 
outcome, Senator. I----
    Senator Kelly. Literally, a disaster, I mean, because we 
are talking about, you know, wildfires that are natural 
disasters.
    Mr. Moore. And we are talking about having a workforce that 
can respond to these fires. We have seen on a number of 
occasions where whole communities have burned. If you don't 
have a workforce in place to be responsive to these fires, then 
you are going to see more of that sort of thing happening, God 
forbid. And so we think it is imperative that we are able to 
respond to these issues around our firefighter needs if we are 
going to have a workforce that is going to be responsive to our 
community needs.
    Senator Kelly. Well, thank you.
    One last question, Chief. Last Congress, Senator Romney and 
I introduced the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management 
Commission Act, which was signed into law as part of the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This established a commission of 
federal, state, and local stakeholders to study and recommend 
new fire prevention mitigation management and rehabilitation 
policies for forests and grasslands. And earlier this year, we 
saw the commission release the first part of their 
recommendations. And the full report is due in September. Is 
this timeline of the full report coming out in September 
correct, and how will the Forest Service work to evaluate and 
incorporate the recommendations of this commission?
    Mr. Moore. I believe it will meet its intent. I, you know, 
we--while we are not directly involved in it, we are involved 
from a distance. And we feel that so far, from what I know, 
what we know, that these are good recommendations coming out of 
the commission.
    Senator Kelly. And you feel like you will be able to 
implement them?
    Mr. Moore. I certainly hope so. But, you know, it is all 
going to boil down to whether we are funded to implement a lot 
of these types of issues, but the interest is there, the 
motivation is there. It is just a matter of do we have the 
resources to match that.
    Senator Kelly. Okay, thank you.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    And now, we have Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chief, good to see you again. Second time in a month, I 
guess, here. Last month, at the appropriations discussion, I 
asked you about tribal co-management and the Forest Service. 
Many of the tribes in Alaska, as you know, are leaders in self-
governance. They are very interested in the opportunities that 
can be presented through tribal management and through co-
management operations, specifically on the 638 contracts. So we 
have a farm bill in 2018 that authorized the 638 contracting 
for tribal forest restoration projects, but as we discussed, 
that authority is limited to projects on federal lands that are 
bordering on or adjacent to Indian forest or rangeland. So we 
did get some technical assistance from USDA that can perhaps 
help address these geographic limitations, but we are also 
trying to figure out a way to expand 638 contracting and 
compacting to some additional activities.
    So the question to you and your team is whether or not we 
will have the information or the legal reviews that we need to 
fix the existing 638 contracting authority that was in that 
prior farm bill to be able to extend it, to be able to allow 
for compacting so that we can utilize this in Alaska. Can you 
give me an update or a heads-up on that?
    Mr. Moore. I think that USDA may be a better source to 
provide that information, Senator. I don't have it.
    Senator Murkowski. Okay. I think that maybe this is an 
issue where both of you think that the other one is doing it. 
So let's follow up on this. Afterwards, we will connect with 
USDA as well, but I just want to make sure that we do not miss 
this window. We have the farm bill coming up. This, obviously, 
is an area of interest, not just for us in Alaska, but others 
as well, so.
    Mr. Moore. And I would agree that this would be important, 
and I think it would be, really, a good addition.
    Senator Murkowski. Good. Thank you. Let's work on that.
    I also mentioned at the last hearing the Southeast Alaska 
Sustainability Strategy and USDA's initial commitment there--
$25 million to address the situation in the Tongass. When this 
was announced--the $25 million was announced in July 2021--it 
was underscored at that time and reinforced that this was an 
initial commitment to the region. Can you share with me where 
the Forest Service is with requesting additional support for 
the Southeast Sustainability Strategy in the President's 
budget?
    Mr. Moore. I do not believe it is specifically marked out 
in the President's budget, Senator, but we do plan to provide 
resources to that project.
    Senator Murkowski. Can you share with me any expectation in 
terms of a timeline or what you are thinking about in terms of 
time and what the communities in the region might expect?
    Mr. Moore. So I will commit to you this year, yet, in terms 
of the specifics, I will follow up with you on that, but I 
will----
    Senator Murkowski. Okay, well, again, we have communities 
that, as you know, are struggling, as we have seen, yet one 
more round of imposition of the Roadless Rule and the 
limitations that that provides--I don't think that $25 million 
is adequate to address the decline that we see within the 
industry there, the timber industry in Southeast, and I think 
those of you in the Forest Service have concurred with my 
assessment of that. And so, there have been a lot of promises, 
but we really have not seen beyond that initial announcement 
that there has been additional follow-on. And so, I will keep 
pressing to make sure that you know that Alaskans were led to 
believe that that was an initial commitment to the region and 
that there will be more to come.
    One----
    Mr. Moore. Before you leave that one, Senator, can I follow 
up with you next week?
    Senator Murkowski. Yes.
    Mr. Moore. With the specifics of that.
    Senator Murkowski. Yes, I would look forward to that. Thank 
you, Chief.
     And then, last question here--I have also raised 
previously--the local hire and the incorporation of local 
knowledge in land management is super-important for us in 
Alaska, but particularly, empowering our tribes to partner as 
wildland firefighters is a pretty powerful tool for that. So 
any updates on what the service is doing to recruit and retain 
more tribal partners?
    Mr. Moore. Yes, actually, I was just told recently that we 
have just hired 100 of our tribal partners and we are still 
going off of other opportunities for potential, but the region 
has been very optimistic and very happy to be able to bring 
that many of their tribal members on board. And so----
    Senator Murkowski. Good. Well, maybe as we do a follow-up 
in the next week or so on these other issues, you can provide 
me a little more detail on where we are seeing those additional 
hires. That is good news.
    Mr. Moore. I would be happy to.
    Senator Murkowski. Good.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Chief.
    The Chairman. Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    A couple quick things, Chief Moore. On March 30 of this 
year, the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the 
Interior issued a proposed rule that seeks to lock Americans 
out of their public lands, effectively upending the agency's 
multiple-use mandate. This proposed rule was devised and 
written without any input from critical partners and leaders on 
the ground. So Wyoming families, our local economies, depend on 
access to public lands for energy and critical mineral 
development, for grazing, for forest and timber management, and 
recreation. So what I ask you is, to your knowledge, is the 
Forest Service or the Department of Agriculture in any way 
devising a similar rule for national forests and grasslands?
    Mr. Moore. No, Senator, we are not.
    Senator Barrasso. Great.
    I want to follow up a little bit with what Senator King was 
talking about. The budget request that you came out with 
includes a $2 million cut to the roads line-item. I have it 
right here, under capital improvements and maintenance. So when 
I go to this $2 million cut and read under it, ``forest system 
roads and bridges provide access for first responders in 
emergencies.'' Your own report says that a decrease of $2 
million, which you are proposing, cutting it by $2 million, 
would reduce the capital improvements, would reduce maintenance 
on roads, maintenance on bridges, and it could negatively 
affect priority access work for fuel reductions and watershed 
health. All right.
    So you say you cut $2 million and we know it is going to be 
bad because it is going to cause these hardships. At the same 
time, your budget increases the facilities line-item by $71 
million, of which $60 million is for electric vehicle charging 
infrastructure--$60 million for electric vehicle charging 
infrastructure--but you are willing to cut roads and bridges 
for our first responders, for fuel reduction, and for watershed 
health, which is only, you know, which is $2 million. You know, 
you look at this and say, why is the Forest Service 
prioritizing electric vehicles over public safety and fighting 
forest fires and allowing first responders access to the area?
    Mr. Moore. I would never agree that it is a matter of 
choosing between the two. I think it is always just trying to 
balance out, you know, emerging issues. And when we look at 
recreation and increased visitor use and we look at some of the 
trends that are occurring in this country where more and more 
electric vehicles are being purchased, then we also want to be 
able to try and provide resources, not only for that trend that 
we see in America, but also for our vehicles that we are 
starting to purchase that are electric in nature. So when 
visitors come to our national forests and our recreation 
facilities, we, in some locations, are wanting to put in plug-
in opportunities so that they don't incidentally get stranded 
along the way.
    So it is just a trend that we are trying to be responsive 
to, Senator.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, I won't want to make it be a trend 
that we are willing to give up on fuel reduction and watershed 
health.
    Mr. Moore. Yes.
    Senator Barrasso. I mean, you should have thought, well you 
could have said, well, let's just not do that and only put $58 
million into the other issue, but you did not choose to do 
that. You did--the trend is to get rid of what we think we need 
is really important to do something. I would just say, look, I 
know that President Biden is singularly focused on forcing 
every American into an electric vehicle, no matter the cost, no 
matter the consequences. That is his big deal. I would hope 
that you are going to fight against the rest of the 
Administration's efforts to prioritize EVs over saving lives, 
over saving property, over forest health. If a loss of life and 
property is not enough to convince the Administration, maybe 
you can remind them that wildfires release massive amounts of 
carbon into the atmosphere and preventing a forest fire, 
getting earlier access in there, is going to have a much bigger 
impact on carbon emissions than the vehicles coming into the 
forest. I mean, it just seems ridiculous.
    Mr. Moore. It sounds like you are making a statement, sir, 
not necessarily a question?
    Senator Barrasso. Well, I would ask you, does what I am 
saying make sense in terms of what you want to do for forest 
health?
    Mr. Moore. Well, I think it is really vitally important for 
us to really look at forest health. I mean, we have a 
significant problem out there and I have testified earlier 
that, in my opinion, we are in an emergency situation out on 
our lands and that we need to prioritize it. And I think we 
are, to a large degree. We said that this is an emergent 
situation. We are using all kinds of tools to indicate that it 
is an emergent situation. And I think that we are providing as 
much attention as we possibly can on this issue that we have 
out on our public lands.
    Senator Barrasso. But certainly, it seems to me, that in 
terms of what may be an emerging trend years from now, mandated 
by the Administration--clearly not needed for the emergent 
situation that I have heard you describe today--it does seem 
that there is a reallocation issue that I would prefer had gone 
a different direction.
    Let me just--one other area. In addition to managing forest 
landscapes, the agency also manages rangelands and grasslands. 
Ranching families in Wyoming and across the West partner with 
the Forest Service to ensure good stewardship over all of these 
lands. Revenues generated by grazing fees that are paid by our 
ranchers go into the Range Betterment Fund. This fund is used 
to help keep our range and grasslands in a healthy condition. 
My legislation, the RANCH Act, would effectively double this 
contribution without raising grazing fees or the deficit. The 
agency could be matching our ranchers' contribution with its 
own funds. This would demonstrate a more meaningful commitment 
from the agency to help improve rangeland health.
    Why isn't the Forest Service matching the funds that are 
put into this program by the ranchers?
    Mr. Moore. I am not familiar with that part of it, Senator. 
We certainly feel that range management is critically 
important, and particularly out West. And so I would be happy 
to sit down with you to get ideas from you on what you think we 
could and should be doing.
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    I have just one final question and then we will wrap up. 
But Chief Moore, I noticed you are requesting a $52 million 
increase in your IT budget in order to accommodate telework. I 
believe in physical attendance. You don't agree with that?
    Mr. Moore. I would like for you to finish.
    The Chairman. Well, I mean, it is just horrible, people got 
to come to work. They are not coming to work. That's in a 
nutshell. Just make me understand why you think they should be 
spending $52 million to make sure they don't come to work.
    Mr. Moore. So the reason I was looking there, and I am not 
familiar with the $52 million to come to work. What I will say 
is that OMB announced last week the order to come back to work. 
And so what we are doing now within the Department of 
Agriculture is working to develop a plan within the next 30 
days to see what that would look like. In my case, for the 
Forest Service, within the Department--what that would look 
like for the agencies within the Department. We just recently 
put a team together as of this week and we have begun to work 
on what that would look like--coming back to work, what that 
would look like.
    The Chairman. I'm just saying, we just picked it up out of 
your budget. It said $52 million for IT, which I assumed was 
going to be computers for people to take home and work from. Is 
that----
    Mr. Moore. Yes, ideally, if we are going to be working from 
home, you know, we need to provide the resources available to 
work from home, but keep in mind that that was there before 
this decision was made last week, and so we are going to have 
to make some adjustments based on the new decision that was 
made as of last week.
    The Chairman. Yes, well, you all can check it in your own 
request. It's pretty plain.
    Mr. Moore. I am saying that request was before the 
announcement that was made last week, and so now we will have 
to adjust that.
    The Chairman. Okay, well, let me make sure that you 
understand that a lot of us up here are hearing from groups 
that long partnered in past administrations for the Forest 
Service. They are telling me part of the reason that the Forest 
Service is not hitting so many of its targets is because 
employees are not coming to work.
    Mr. Moore. But I would say----
    The Chairman. It's not just in the Forest Service, sir. We 
are hearing it across the board.
    Mr. Moore. But I----
    The Chairman. Yes, go ahead.
    Mr. Moore. I'm sorry. I would say that that is not true. In 
fact, our productivity has slightly increased. And keep in 
mind, Senator----
    The Chairman. You ought to tell these people that--
    Mr. Moore. A lot of our field-going people were never 
really teleworking or remote working. They have been working 
through this entire pandemic. Where that has happened to a 
greater degree has been in our regional offices, our station 
offices, and our national headquarters. It is where that has 
been, generally. So the field-going, at that forest level and 
district level, has always been at work----
    The Chairman. Well, I am not talking--yes, I know what you 
are saying. As far as that goes, you are always going to have 
your field work. We understand that. We are understanding that 
basically a lot the phones are not getting answered, not just 
in yours, but so many agencies across the Federal Government. 
Reports are not being filed. Timeliness as far as getting 
anything done, people are waiting longer periods of time for 
any type of permit process or procedure just because people are 
not showing up. You can take the IRS all the way through the 
Federal Government and we are throwing money at it from this 
standpoint. I don't know if it's going to improve unless people 
are required to come to work or find another job. That's about 
it.
    So with that, I will stop it there.
    I want thank you all, again, for coming.
    Members are going to have until the close of business 
tomorrow to submit additional questions for the record.
    And the Committee will stand adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:37 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
