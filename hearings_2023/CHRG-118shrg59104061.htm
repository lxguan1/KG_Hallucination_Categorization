                        U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE


             opening statement of senator christopher coons


    Senator Coons. I call this hearing to order. Welcome to the 
first State and Foreign Operations Hearing of the fiscal year 
2024 Appropriations process.
    Each member of the subcommittee will have 7 minutes for 
questions. Those present will be called in order of seniority, 
followed by members in order of arrival. Alternating sides, of 
course, between the parties. If you miss your turn and later 
come back and rejoin, I will do my best to insert you at the 
appropriate time. We will have a second round of questions, 
time permitting.
    Mr. Secretary, it is great to have you with us again. We 
have a lot to cover. But let me briefly first mention that 
tomorrow is the 1 year anniversary of the passing of a dear 
friend, Secretary Madeleine Albright. I was pleased that we 
could honor her tremendous impact on U.S. diplomacy and 
national security in last year's fiscal year 2023 SFOPS Bill, 
and will continue to reflect our shared values through the work 
of the State Department.
    Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for what you are doing to keep 
alive her memory, as someone who was a clear-eyed, high 
spirited, and hardworking advocate for our unique role, as the 
indispensable nation.
    I know that you and the President also believe in the 
importance, the centrality of bipartisanship in foreign policy. 
I am very fortunate to have Senator Graham as the Ranking 
Member on this subcommittee, and strong subcommittee membership 
on both sides of the aisle. I am confident we can forge and 
maintain bipartisan support to address the most critical 
challenges facing us, and to advance America's interests, 
including supporting Ukraine's determined fight against Russian 
aggression, countering the threats posed by China, and 
leveraging our trade tools in the private sector to drive our 
core economic interests.
    We have made real progress together to advance our national 
security priorities over the last 2 years, this subcommittee 
has provided you and the President with the tools you need to 
lead the international community in unwavering support of the 
Ukrainian people. We have recognized the need to enhance U.S. 
competitiveness globally, using our diplomatic and 
developmental tools, especially to address the coercive 
influence of authoritarian states, like the PRC and Russia.
    We work closely together to help you strengthen the State 
Department workforce, provided additional flexibility, 
increased funding, and work to expand the U.S. presence 
overseas, accordingly, including in the Indo-Pacific.
    We have addressed the impacts of an unprecedented number of 
globally displaced people, roughly 100 million, so far, and an 
ongoing global food crisis. And we reaffirmed U.S. multilateral 
engagement by enabling you to rejoin UNESCO, and increase 
investments to support Americans seeking entry-level and 
leadership positions in international organizations.
    But, we face enormous challenges. Vladimir Putin continues 
his barbaric assault on Ukraine. The PRC, through 
misinformation, and expanded diplomatic developmental trade 
investments seeks to reshape the global environment challenging 
our core interests. There are the ongoing impacts of climate 
change including increased water and food insecurity that are 
driving mass displacement and fueling instability. And a 
sustained global trend of democratic backsliding.
    We need to be proactive, and use every tool at our disposal 
to get ahead of these challenges. Your task is daunting, and my 
message to my colleagues is simple: We can't do more with less. 
We must increase our investments in our diplomatic and 
development tools if we want to strengthen our national 
security. That is why I am encouraged by the fiscal year 2024 
budget request for the State Department, USAID, and Related 
Agencies. It is an ambitious request, but the challenges of our 
time demand no less.
    We look forward to discussing the details with you, 
including your highest priorities, as we consider how best to 
support the Department's critically important people, programs, 
and operations.
    Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
    Senator Graham.


              opening statement of senator lindsey graham


    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to also 
welcome Senator Collins, and Senator Murray. They have done a 
good job of getting the Committee back in business. We are 
having hearings, we are going to do markups, we are going to 
become appropriators again, and that is welcome news to me.
    As to the budget request, it is ambitious. We have got to 
deal with the House eventually. An 11 percent increase, I don't 
think the market will bear that, but we will do the best we 
can. I consider this account to be national security in another 
form. Soft power, to me, is just as important as hard power, 
and many times even more important.
    We are dealing with real threats out there. Countering 
China is one of them. A 13.1 billion dollar mandatory spending 
request in this budget is not going to fly. We need to 
appropriate money directly to counter the influence of China, 
but it will not be in a mandatory spending construct, like it 
has been requested. I want to work with you Mr. Chairman, and 
the Department, for coming up with some funds to counter China 
throughout the world, particularly in their backyard.
    Bottom line is we will get the bill done. We always do. I 
enjoy working with you. On Taiwan: there is no funding in the 
budget, specifically, for Taiwan. Senator Menendez and I, and 
many others have pushed for a $2 million authorization for 
Taiwan's defense needs, and I think we need to put money 
directed for Taiwan's defense needs in the bill during markup, 
when that time comes.
    But Mr. Secretary, I want to say this to you and your 
personnel; you serve in very dangerous places without a lot of 
military support at times. The military gets a lot of credit, 
and they deserve it, but our men and women of the State 
Department, they are heroes in their own way. And I appreciate 
what they do for our country.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Ranking Member Graham.
    It is my understanding the Chair and Vice Chair did not 
want to make opening statements?
    Senator Murray. I do have one, but I can wait for the 
Secretary.
    Senator Coons. Mr. Secretary, if you would, please proceed.

STATEMENT OF HON. ANTONY J. BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF 
            STATE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you, very, very much.
    Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, very good to be with 
you; Chair Murray, Vice Chair Collins, to all the Committee 
Members here today, thank you for this opportunity to speak 
with you about our proposed fiscal year 2024 budget for the 
State Department and USAID.
    And I think as you have both laid out in different ways, we 
are meeting at an inflection point. The post-Cold War era is 
over, and there is an intense competition underway to shape, to 
determine, what comes next.
    We, the United States, have a positive vision for the 
future: a world that is free, that is secure, that is open, 
that is prosperous. And it is our belief that the budget that 
we put forward will help advance that vision and deliver on 
issues that actually matter to the American people, 
particularly by preparing us to effectively meet two broad sets 
of challenges.
    The first is the challenge posed by our strategic 
competitors. The immediate, acute threat posed by Russia's 
autocracy and aggression, most destructively, of course, 
through its brutal aggression against Ukraine, and the long-
term challenge from the People's Republic of China.
    The second set of challenges is really posed by shared 
global tests, including the climate crisis, migration, food and 
energy insecurity, pandemics, all of which directly impact the 
lives and livelihoods of Americans and people around the world.
    With this committee's leadership and support, including 
through the fiscal year 2023 Omnibus, the United States is in a 
stronger geopolitical position than we were 2 years ago, hence 
our ability to deal with these challenges, I think has been 
enhanced.
    We have drawn enormous power from investments that we have 
made in our own economic strength and technological edge at 
home, including through the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, the 
CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act.
    The unmatched network of alliances and partnerships has 
never been stronger. In fact, we have been building on it, not 
only strengthening existing alliances and partnerships, but 
building new coalitions of countries and other institutions 
that are fit-for-purpose.
    We are expanding our presence in critical regions, like the 
Indo-Pacific. We are leading the unprecedented coalitions to 
confront aggression and address humanitarian challenges around 
the world.
    The fiscal year 2024 budget request for the State 
Department and USAID meets this moment head on. This budget 
will sustain our security, economic, energy, and humanitarian 
support for Ukraine to ensure that President Putin's war 
remains a strategic failure.
    It will strengthen our efforts to outcompete the PRC. 
President Biden is firmly committed to advancing a free and 
open Indo-Pacific, which is why this proposal asks for an 18 
percent increase in our budget for that region over fiscal year 
2023.
    The budget contains both discretionary and mandatory 
proposals, and we are happy to talk about why we proceeded this 
way, for new, innovative investments to outcompete China. 
Including, by enhancing our presence in the region, and 
ensuring that what we and our fellow democracies are able to 
offer, including maritime security, disease surveillance, clean 
energy infrastructure, digital technology, is more attractive 
than any alternative.
    The budget will help us push back on advancing 
authoritarianism and democratic backsliding by strengthening 
democracies around the world, including through supporting 
independent media, countering corruption, defending free and 
fair elections. And it will allow us to pay our contributions 
to international organizations, because we need to be at the 
table wherever and whenever new international rules that affect 
the livelihoods of our people are being debated and being 
decided.
    The budget will allow us to continue leading the world to 
addressing these global challenges, from food and energy 
insecurity to climate and health crises.
    And just on that last point, as you all know, we are 
celebrating now the 20th anniversary of PEPFAR, which I think 
is one of the greatest achievements in our foreign policy over 
the last decades. It has helped us save 25 million lives around 
the world.
    This budget will help us continue the fight against HIV/
AIDS, while advancing health security more broadly through a 
new Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy, which I 
look forward to working with Congress to establish this year.
    The budget will advance our efforts to modernize the State 
Department, including by expanding our training float, updating 
our technology, carrying out diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility initiatives including, to make our overseas 
missions more accessible.
    I am grateful for the progress we have already made 
together, including Congress' support in updating the Secure 
Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act, and 
Accountability Review Board to give us some of the flexibility 
that we need to open new missions and better manage the risks 
that we face.
    We know there is more to do. And we are looking forward to 
working with Congress to accelerate these modernization efforts 
so that the Department can better attract, better retain, and 
support a first-rate workforce as they advance our interests in 
what is a very complex and fast-moving world.
    Finally, the budget will further a personal priority for 
me, and I know for many of you, and that is supporting Enduring 
Welcome, our whole-of-government effort to resettle our Afghan 
allies. Keeping our promises to those who served alongside the 
U.S. remains an unwavering priority. This budget will help us 
continue to make good on that commitment.
    When I took on this role, I committed to doing my part to 
try to restore Congress' place as an equal partner in our 
foreign policymaking. I am determined to continue to do that 
and very much appreciate the work that we have been able to do 
with this committee over the last couple of years and look 
forward to the work ahead.
    And with that, I welcome any questions. Thank you.

    Prepared Statement of Secretary of State Hon. Antony J. Blinken
    Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, Chair Murray, Vice Chair 
Collins, committee members: thank you for the opportunity to speak with 
you about the administration's proposed FY 2024 budget for the State

    Prepared Statement of Diana R. Shaw, Deputy Inspector General* 
    (*Performing The Duties Of The Inspector General) United States 
                          Department of State
    Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, and distinguished Members of 
the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony 
today for this hearing on the U.S. Department of State's fiscal year 
2024 budget request.
    The Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the U.S. Department of 
State (Department) inspects embassies and diplomatic posts throughout 
the world to determine whether policy goals are being achieved and 
whether the interests of the United States are being represented and 
advanced effectively. OIG performs specialized security inspections and 
audits in support of the Department's mission to provide effective 
protection to our personnel, facilities, and sensitive information. OIG 
also audits Department operations and activities to ensure that they 
are as effective and efficient as possible. Finally, OIG investigates 
instances of fraud, waste, and mismanagement that may constitute either 
criminal wrongdoing or violations of Department regulations. In short, 
OIG plays a crucial role in overseeing the funds Congress appropriates 
to the Department for its many programs and activities and we believe 
that our work can play an important role in assisting Subcommittee 
Members with funding decisions.
    A growing and substantial element of our mission emerged within the 
last year: oversight of the U.S. government's response to the invasion 
of Ukraine. In the past fiscal year, we have worked closely with our 
OIG counterparts in the Department of Defense (DoD) and the U.S. Agency 
for International Development (USAID), as well as the broader oversight 
community, to ensure comprehensive oversight of the more than $113 
billion in U.S. assistance that has been appropriated as a result of 
the war in Ukraine. This remains our top priority for the coming year.
    In this testimony, I will discuss the nature and scope of our 
oversight mission, various projects related to Ukraine and Afghanistan, 
and other recently completed and noteworthy projects. I will conclude 
by making an appeal for the subcommittee's assistance in addressing 
OIG's resource challenges.
                          mission and results
    OIG's mandate covers both Department and the U.S. Agency for Global 
Media (USAGM) programs and operations, which include more than 80,000 
employees and more than 270 overseas missions and domestic entities. We 
also oversee the U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water 
Commission, a Federal agency that operates under the foreign policy 
guidance of the Department. In terms of dollars, we are responsible for 
the oversight of more than $81 billion in Department, USAGM, and 
foreign assistance resources.
    In pursuit of this mission, OIG provides valuable return on 
investment through its audits, evaluations, inspections, and 
investigations. In FY 2022 alone, OIG identified nearly $400 million in 
questioned costs and taxpayer funds that could be put to better use. 
Additionally, OIG's criminal, civil, and administrative investigations 
produced $14.7 million in monetary results (including fines, 
restitution, and recoveries) in the last fiscal year.
    Our work consistently results in findings and recommendations that 
significantly improve the programs and activities we oversee--including 
improvements that are not easily quantifiable, such as our safety and 
security work. By helping the Department improve its security, OIG's 
work safeguards the lives of the thousands of people who work in or 
visit U.S. posts abroad and at home. Our recommendations frequently 
address inadequate compliance with emergency planning standards and 
facility safety and security deficiencies.
    Further, our investigative work consistently holds employees, 
contractors, and grantees accountable. In FY 2022, OIG obtained 14 
indictments or informations\1\ and 16 convictions. In one case, a 
former employee was sentenced to 5 years in prison and ordered to pay 
approximately $2 million in restitution for using his official position 
to embezzle grant money by falsifying official documents to solicit 
overpayments.
                          ukraine-related work
    As mentioned, Ukraine oversight is our top priority. State OIG, 
along with DoD and USAID OIGs, as well as other U.S. government 
oversight organizations, have adopted a collaborative approach to 
ensure that our oversight of the U.S. government's response to the 
Ukraine crisis is comprehensive, relevant, timely, and transparent, and 
preemptively identifies and mitigates gaps in coverage or duplication 
of effort. At State OIG, we have 43 staff members working on Ukraine 
oversight projects full time and a total of 107 staff members 
contributing on at least a part-time basis. Congress provided us with 
$13.5 million in dedicated funding for Ukraine response oversight--
funds that are available through FY 2024. We are grateful for this 
essential support and are using these funds to support about two dozen 
Ukraine response oversight projects. As of today, we have completed 
four of these projects.
    One of the completed projects is an information brief issued in 
December of last year.\2\ This brief is a tool for decisionmakers at 
the Department to assist them with preventing and mitigating challenges 
encountered in similar situations. In the brief, we noted that Embassy 
Kyiv's dispersed operations, with essential functions simultaneously 
based in Poland and Ukraine, present a similar set of leadership and 
management challenges faced by remote missions examined in prior work. 
The brief highlights effective practices for addressing such challenges 
and was well received by Department personnel.
    Also in the brief, we noted the challenge of conducting official 
activities in Ukraine where there are significant security 
restrictions. Although this makes monitoring and evaluation activities 
difficult, we identified and shared practices from our past work that 
have been successful in addressing such difficult circumstances, 
including the establishment of third-party monitoring contracts to 
increase visibility on the ground and the need to properly document 
monitoring and evaluation practices.
    We have many other projects underway, including a review of the 
management and operations at Embassy Kyiv to determine whether the 
Department established a foreign assistance strategy and how it is 
exercising its foreign assistance coordination responsibilities. We 
will also describe Embassy Kyiv's operating status, highlight potential 
risks, and outline how the Department plans to address facilities, 
staffing, and security challenges. Other projects will address end use 
monitoring of security assistance to Ukraine and examine whether the 
Department implemented Ukraine-related humanitarian assistance in 
accordance with policies, guidance, and award terms and conditions to 
ensure funds achieve intended objectives.
    I believe that robust oversight of the U.S. government's response 
to the invasion of Ukraine will help give both taxpayers and Congress 
the necessary confidence that our resources are being used efficiently 
and effectively.
                        afghanistan-related work
    Another priority is oversight of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
In the wake of the Department's suspension of operations in 2021, OIG 
devoted substantial time and resources to planning and coordinating 
oversight activities focusing on key aspects of the situation and its 
aftermath. For example, in response to a congressional request, OIG 
issued an information report on the Afghan special immigrant visa 
(SIV)\3\ process and related data.\4\ In an audit of the same program, 
we found that the Department's actions to address open OIG 
recommendations related to the SIV process did not improve methods for 
collecting or verifying Afghan SIV application processing times.\5\ 
Specifically, the Department established procedures for calculating the 
average processing time for applications; however, it continued to use 
inconsistent calculation methods because the procedures lacked details 
and did not encompass the entire Afghan SIV process.
    In addition, we discovered a lack of internal controls for 
verifying Afghan SIV data and the Department continued to face a 
significant SIV application backlog. The backlog occurred for several 
reasons, including insufficient staffing, limited coordination with the 
Department of Defense, and the lack of prioritizing SIV functionality 
within the Department's consular system modernization program. We 
concluded that these deficiencies may have delayed vulnerable Afghan 
allies from reaching safety.
    In other work, we inspected the Afghanistan Affairs Unit (AAU) and 
learned that Department and interagency stakeholders were unclear about 
the lines of responsibility among the multiple Department entities that 
had a role in managing U.S. government policy or programs for 
Afghanistan: the AAU, the Special Representative for Afghanistan, the 
Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs' Afghanistan Desk, and the 
Special Envoy for Afghan Women, Girls, and Human Rights, among others. 
Although there was some principal-level coordination, an understanding 
about the division of responsibilities at the working level was less 
clear. Failure to redefine responsibilities and authorities when 
multiple entities contribute to the Department's policies and programs 
can result in duplication of effort, delayed action, and resource 
misallocation.
    Our work on Afghanistan is ongoing. We continue to closely 
coordinate with other relevant OIGs, and we have several forthcoming 
projects, including a review of the evacuation and suspension of 
operations at Embassy Kabul.
                        other oversight efforts
    For our oversight work outside of the specific contexts of Ukraine 
and Afghanistan, I would like to highlight some recent findings and 
recommendations that relate to three management challenges that we have 
consistently identified for the Department: safety and security, 
stewardship, and staffing.
Safety and Security
    Safeguarding people, facilities, property, and information is a 
continual challenge for the Department. Physical security and safety 
deficiencies at diplomatic facilities is one aspect of this challenge. 
To illustrate, a recent inspection of Embassy Kuwait City, Kuwait, 
found that the Embassy did not comply with all Department standards for 
two buildings constructed on the chancery compound.\6\ The Embassy 
built the permanent structures without requesting the required 
technical review to ensure the projects conformed to Department 
building codes. This is problematic because construction and subsequent 
use of structures without ensuring building code requirements are met 
poses significant life safety risks to employees.
    Residential safety is another area that our inspection work 
frequently assesses. In an inspection of Embassy La Paz, Bolivia, we 
found the Embassy did not assess 17 of its 46 residences for seismic 
risk to mitigate deficiencies. Failure to conduct seismic evaluations 
and mitigate deficiencies risks the life safety of residential 
occupants and could result in fatalities or serious injuries in an 
earthquake.\7\
    Another health and safety risk our work often highlights relates to 
emergency action planning. For example, an audit of emergency action 
plans at domestic facilities showed that plans were not always 
certified in a timely manner and did not always contain complete, 
accurate, and executable information.\8\ Our report noted that when the 
Department addressed the emergency action plan deficiencies, domestic 
Department personnel would be better prepared to execute emergency 
procedures that are meant to prevent injury, loss of life, and property 
damage.
    In addition to the security of people and property, we often focus 
on information security, and our oversight of the Department's IT 
security program continues to identify numerous control weaknesses. The 
FY 2022 Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) audit 
concluded again that the Department had not fully developed and 
implemented an effective organization-wide information security 
program.\9\ Specifically, we reported that the Department was operating 
below an effective level in four of five FISMA cybersecurity functions, 
making it vulnerable to IT-focused attacks and threats to its critical 
mission-related functions.
Stewardship
    Efficiently and effectively managing its significant resources is 
another longstanding challenge for the Department. OIG's work 
demonstrates that the Department could enhance its stewardship of 
taxpayer resources by improving its ability to identify and address 
weaknesses in financial and property management and contract and grant 
oversight. Additionally, identifying and addressing weaknesses in its 
internal controls is an element of the Department's stewardship 
challenge.
    For example, a January inspection revealed that the Bureau of 
International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) had weak and 
missing internal controls related to monitoring, evaluating, and 
closeout of foreign assistance projects. OIG also found multiple 
internal control weaknesses in the management of its bureau resources 
and information management operations. Regarding the latter, OIG found 
deficiencies and waste in information technology contract management, 
and a lack of oversight for both domestic and overseas systems. Most of 
OIG's 28 recommendations were related to weak internal controls, which 
collectively hindered INL's ability to effectively plan, manage, and 
evaluate the results of its projects, programs, and operations.\10\
    Turning to contracts, during one project we found that the 
Department did not administer its domestic guard services contract, 
valued at approximately $362 million, in accordance with applicable 
Federal and Department standards.\11\ For example, we found that 
Contracting Officer's Representatives files were incomplete. We also 
found that the Department had not obtained sufficient documentation to 
support invoice approval. During the project, we identified numerous 
issues with the invoices, including mathematical errors, incorrect 
number of hours worked, and lack of overtime approval. As a result of 
these deficiencies, we questioned the entire amount of the contract 
(approximately $362 million).
    We also issued a report related to how the Department promotes 
competition for overseas construction projects.\12\ During that 
project, we found that the Department took steps to promote competition 
as required by law but had not developed a formal process to guide its 
efforts. Moreover, the Department did not fully comply with acquisition 
planning and market research requirements. Until deficiencies are 
addressed, the Department will continue to miss opportunities for 
increased competition that could enhance the Department's ability to 
obtain quality construction services at reasonable prices.
    Likewise, proper oversight and management of grants and cooperative 
agreements continues to be a challenge for the Department. In an audit 
of Federal assistance to for-profit organizations, we found that Grants 
Officers and Grants Officer Representatives did not always manage and 
monitor selected awards in accordance with requirements.\13\ 
Specifically, the grant officials did not consistently perform and 
document performance and financial monitoring, complete updates to risk 
assessments and monitoring plans, or conduct annual reviews when 
applicable. Until the deficiencies are addressed, the Department will 
not have reasonable assurance that awards are being administered in 
accordance with requirements.
Staffing
    The Department expends substantial resources on recruiting, 
training, and retaining a diverse, talented workforce capable of 
carrying out the Department's foreign policy mission and priorities. 
However, OIG's work finds that staffing gaps, frequent turnover, poor 
oversight, and inexperienced and undertrained staff are frequent 
challenges for the Department.
    In one report from the past year, OIG examined the process for 
selecting public members of Foreign Service Selection Boards (FSSBs), 
the entities responsible for selecting and promoting all Foreign 
Service Officers. OIG found that the Bureau of Global Talent Management 
did not demonstrate that it considered all required criteria when 
recruiting and selecting FSSB public members. Less than half of the 
public members who served from 2019 through 2021 were fully qualified 
under these criteria. OIG also found that the public member recruitment 
and selection process lacked adequate management oversight and internal 
controls to minimize the risk of favoritism and to ensure that the best 
qualified applicants were recruited and chosen. For example, family 
members of Department employees received public member contracts to 
serve on FSSBs every year from 2014 to 2021.\14\
    In another example, an OIG inspection of Embassy Khartoum, Sudan, 
illustrated the unique staffing challenges presented in a difficult or 
critical operating environment. We found the diplomatic post had 
persistent difficulty in attracting bidders to fill Foreign Service 
positions. Despite incentives and allowances, the Embassy struggled to 
attract mid-level officers, which, in turn led to long-term staffing 
gaps in the Embassy's Political-Economic, Public Diplomacy, and 
Consular Sections. For instance, the Public Diplomacy Section sustained 
a staffing gap of 20 months or more for two of its three U.S. direct-
hire positions. Similarly, the Political-Economic and Consular Sections 
sustained long-term gaps of more than 1 year.\15\
                               resources
    We appreciate the subcommittee's ongoing support of our work and 
are grateful for the $13.5 billion in supplemental funding for Ukraine 
response oversight. The subcommittee's timely foresight in recognizing 
the draw on OIG resources created by the invasion of Ukraine allowed us 
to strategically shift our focus and resources to this critical and 
dynamic event.
    Nonetheless, OIG's baseline budget has remained relatively flat in 
recent years, which has affected our operations in significant ways. We 
have not been able to keep pace with inflation due to our static budget 
and we have had to scale back staffing--instituting a hiring freeze for 
the first 9 months of FY 2022. More fundamentally, it has jeopardized 
our ability to sustain high-quality oversight work across the wide 
spectrum of programs and activities at the Department and USAGM. In 
addition to meeting our mandated reporting responsibilities, the 
effectiveness of our oversight relies on our ability to take on 
important discretionary work, including work on big initiatives of 
congressional interest, such as Afghanistan. Our funding challenges 
have made this difficult.
    I would like to quantify the magnitude of this challenge. As 
mentioned earlier, we oversee approximately $81 billion in agency 
resources, funds that span more than 35 appropriation accounts. While 
those accounts have grown over time, our budget has remained relatively 
constant, resulting in our budget being less than a quarter of 1 
percent of what is appropriated to the accounts we oversee. In absolute 
terms, OIG would have needed an additional $94 million across FYs 2020-
2023 to keep pace with increases in the scale and scope of the programs 
we oversee.
    Our FY 2024 budget request was designed to reset the relationship 
between our budget and the dollars we oversee, while also addressing 
past shortfalls. Our FY 2023 baseline appropriation was $93 million, 
and we are pursuing a roughly 15 percent increase for FY 2024 to $106.8 
million. This level of funding will help us address key priorities 
related to Department and USAGM management challenges, maintain our 
core operations, and adapt to future workforce needs.
    Beyond securing adequate funding, a related resource priority for 
State OIG is securing quality oversight professionals to meet 
increasing oversight demands. I am fortunate to lead an organization 
with outstanding staff members who have pivoted quickly to focus on 
Ukraine-related work. However, we must not let the Ukraine response 
oversight detract from our broader oversight mission spanning the 
globe. We will need to ramp up staffing to effectuate the broad set of 
extensive oversight plans highlighted in this testimony.
    The largest challenge we face in this regard is the current 
selection and appointment requirements, which add months to the 
onboarding process for new hires. In the context of our Ukraine-related 
work, this not only delays our ability to meet staffing needs, but also 
makes it difficult to effectively utilize our supplemental funding. To 
address this challenge and meet the long-term and critical hiring needs 
associated with Ukraine-related oversight, we would like to secure 
selection and appointment flexibilities consistent with direct hire 
authority. We are also seeking legislative changes that would give us 
the same flexible hiring authorities that exist in the context of 
overseas contingency operations.
                               conclusion
    I am incredibly proud of the work of my OIG colleagues and the 
value we provide to the Department, USAGM, Congress, and taxpayers. We 
are a talented and committed team of professionals dedicated to helping 
the Department and USAGM successfully accomplish their respective 
missions through robust oversight and well-designed, practical 
recommendations. I want to thank my team for their resilience, 
ingenuity, integrity, and leadership.
    I also want to conclude by thanking Chairman Coons, Ranking Member 
Graham, and distinguished Members of the subcommittee for the many ways 
in which you support OIG's mission. I take my statutory requirement to 
keep Congress fully and currently informed seriously, and I appreciate 
your enduring interest in our work.

    Senator Coons. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for that brief, 
but a broad review of the challenges we face, and the 
leadership that you have shown at the helm of the State 
Department.
    Let me open with a question, if I could, about the 
workforce. I have had the opportunity to visit State Department 
employees around the world in lots of difficult and dangerous 
places; and like I believe all my colleagues, I am uniformly 
impressed with their skills and their determination.
    If we are going to achieve our national security objective, 
it is critical to ensure our diplomatic corps is putting the 
right people with the right tools, and the right resources, and 
training in the right places to carry out their work. We worked 
together, Senator Graham and I, to ensure that last year's bill 
delivered on that goal, but there is more to be done.
    What are the most critical workforce and other investments 
needed to strengthen the Department to meet the challenges 
confronting us today, and to have the flexibility to meet 
emerging challenges in the year ahead?
    Secretary Blinken. Very much appreciate that question, Mr. 
Chairman. And really, it does come down to us, to people, to 
resources, and in some cases to some authorities, what you will 
see in the budget is a proposed hiring increase for another 500 
new employees to fill some of the staffing gaps that we have, 
and that I can go into more detail on.
    We need more people to address some of these emerging 
priorities and emergencies. That include, for example, a couple 
of hundred new consular positions, I know you are seized with 
some of the challenges that Consular Affairs has experienced 
over the last few years, because of COVID, we have been 
building back in a very significant way, but we need more work 
there, and we need more resources there. So the budget proposes 
that.
    We need an additional number of civil and foreign service 
employees to scale up the Indo-Pacific strategy, and to out-
compete China, to strengthen our outreach to fully staff, for 
example, new missions in the Pacific Islands, something else 
that we can talk about.
    We want to make sure that we are building on something that 
has been a terrific innovation that has been supported by this 
committee, and that is having additional positions so that we 
can increase our float, which enables us to pull people out of 
their day in day out, and allow them to have career-long 
training, so that they can keep their skill set fresh. In fact, 
get new skills as they go along; for example, by coming here to 
spend time, by going to an academic institution, et cetera.
    We are requesting, in addition, new management hires, this 
is critical because where the rubber meets the road in the 
Department, as in so many other institutions, is particularly 
our mid-level management. And we have terrific management 
people in the Department, but what you know, and what you will 
see, is the people who don't actually come up through the 
management silo in the Department are, nonetheless, called upon 
at different stages in their career, to exert management 
skills. We need more there.
    We have money there to make sure that we are protecting our 
missions, and our diplomats, and I commend that to you. We have 
to keep pace with the increased security threats, and costs, 
the growing overseas presence, as I said, in the Pacific 
Islands, we hope to reopen the mission in Libya, something we 
want to work with you on, that is going to require some funding 
as well.
    We have significant funds as well to make sure that we are 
up to speed on cybersecurity. We have all been challenged 
across government by this, and we have to make sure that we 
have the funding to do that. There are a number of authorities 
as well, Mr. Chairman, that we can get into, and I am also 
happy to share with you, that would be very helpful, it would 
be very useful for us to have a new funding account for the 
Enduring Welcome operation, to consolidate up to about $2.5 
billion in existing funding for relocating our Afghan partners.
    There is some personal services, Contractor Authority, we 
need to hire more domestic personnel services contractors, we 
can get to that, some Special Immigrant Visa adjustments, 
again, to make sure that we are making good on our commitments 
to our Afghan allies.
    And then, I would just cite one last thing, there is more 
to be said, but you touched on this. I think it is very 
important for us to be able to pay our multilateral 
commitments. And this is not a gift to these institutions, it 
is not saying that these institutions are perfect, or don't 
need a lot of work, it is saying that when we are not at the 
table, then usually someone else is, and probably not in a way 
that advances our interests and values.
    And particularly in institutions that are actually having a 
real impact on--you know, in windowless rooms, that people 
don't see, in shaping a lot of rules, and a lot of norms, and a 
lot of standards. For example, the way technology is being 
used, we need to be there. And part of being there sometimes is 
paying our dues.
    The other thing that happens in these institutions, we are 
the largest, actually, contributor to the U.N. system, and yet, 
when we are in arrears, our competitors and adversaries point 
to that and say: You know, the United States isn't serious 
about it. So I hope we can do the best possible on that.
    I very much believe we should be back in UNESCO. Again, not 
as a gift to UNESCO, but because things that are happening at 
UNESCO actually matter, and if we are not there, we are not 
shaping it. They are working on rules, norms, and standards for 
artificial intelligence, we want to be there. They are doing 
the same thing on education curricula around the world.
    China right now, is the single-largest contributor to 
UNESCO. That carries a lot of weight. We are not even at the 
table. It is important that we get back there. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Mr. Secretary; both for that 
answer and for your leadership across those different issues. 
You mentioned at the conclusion of your introductory statement, 
Operation Enduring Welcome, I would just be interested in a 
brief update on your efforts to review and identify any lessons 
learned on Afghanistan, so far.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you very much. Yes. One of the 
things that was very important to me was that we conduct an 
after-action review of the State Department's role and 
execution of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. And we initiated 
that review, we brought in very experienced people who had--
including one of our most senior retired diplomats to conduct 
it.
    And they conducted many, many interviews, reviewed many, 
many documents, and produced a, I think, important report that 
looks at what we did, what we did right, what we did wrong, and 
could do better. And other agencies, as you know, have been 
doing the same thing. We have not been spending time putting 
all of this together to make sure that we look at the--some of 
the common lessons learned, especially where there are 
overlaps. And I am committed and determined to make that 
information available to Congress. And we will do that.
    We will do that by mid-April, so I can tell you today, you 
will have the after-action review, we will share the findings, 
and find the appropriate mechanism to do that within the next 
three weeks.
    Senator Coons. Great. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. In your 
opening, you referenced your commitment to including consulting 
with Congress, and including us in the foreign policy making 
process and this is a good example of that work.
    I have long questions I look forward to asking about the 
Development Finance Corporation, the Global Fragility Act. But 
I will just ask one, and then turn to my Ranking Member.
    We are in the middle of a global food crisis, according to 
the World Food Programme: pre-pandemic, there were 135 million 
people in more than 50 countries who were facing hunger. That 
has gone up to 345 million people across more than 80 countries 
today. It is fueled by conflict, climate change, COVID-19, and 
as the war in Ukraine grinds on, its shocks, in terms of prices 
of food and fertilizer, are driving millions to the edge of 
starvation and increasing instability.
    What is the Department doing to increase contributions from 
other donors to help tack this challenge? And what should the 
international community be doing differently in order to 
improve the resiliency of communities facing food insecurity 
for the long term?
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I will say, 
I very much appreciate the leadership of this committee; 
particularly you, Senator Graham, on this issue; and others. I 
say quickly two things: First of all, we have to tackle two 
aspects of this problem. We have emergency situations that 
demand an emergency response, where people need food now.
    And back in May, we gathered together countries from around 
the world at the UN Security Council, to focus them, not just 
us, on the specific things that they can do, and we can do, to 
make sure, to the best of our ability, that food is getting to 
people when they need it.
    And of course, as you know very well, we have had an almost 
perfect storm that has built up between climate change, between 
COVID, and of course conflict, and now, exacerbated 
dramatically by Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine, 
bread basket to the world, that grain was taken off the market 
by the Russian aggression. I am very glad that through the work 
of the United Nations and Turkey, we were able to get the Black 
Sea Corridor going, but that is a fragile thing. It has made a 
difference, but it is fragile.
    So there is the emergency assistance. We have significantly 
increased our own contributions, as you know, we provided about 
$13.5 billion going back to the Russian aggression over the 
course of 2022. We have gotten other countries to step up and 
increase their contributions, World Food Programme, Food and 
Agricultural Organization, the UN Fund. That is one critical 
piece of it.
    But again, as I know you know very well, the other piece 
that is critical, and what I hear, and I know you hear from our 
colleagues around the world, especially in Africa, is that, as 
focused as they are in emergency assistance, what they really 
want, is investment in their productive capacity, and this is 
absolutely critical to making sure that they have sustainable 
agricultural production, and that they ultimately can feed 
their own people, and actually feed others. There is tremendous 
potential in Africa.
    Let me just cite one thing that we are doing. And we have 
in the budget, a significant fund for this. To me, one of the 
most exciting things, building on and adding to the Feed the 
Future Program, that USAID, and the State Department run, is 
something that we have, I think you know, one of the leading 
agronomists in the world at the State Department, Dr. Cary 
Fowler. One of the things that we have learned in recent years 
is that the two most determinative things to having sustainable 
food production capacity, comes down to two things: soil and 
seeds.
    If the soil quality is bad, you can throw as much 
fertilizer on it as you want, it is not going to work. We now 
have the ability to map the quality of soil, pretty much 
anywhere, including throughout Africa, determine where it is 
good, where it is bad, what needs to be done to improve it. And 
we have a program there, the seeds, if they are not resilient 
to drought, to climate, to other things, again, it doesn't 
matter, we have the capacity to do that, to provide resiliency 
through nutritious crops. So I think what you will see in the 
budget is the beginnings of an important program to provide for 
that.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. That is a topic of 
interest to both of us.
    Let me now turn to my Ranking Member, Senator Graham.
    Senator Graham. Yes. I really want to work with you. I 
think what you have said is absolutely spot on. I talked to 
Larry Ellison, from Oracle, and he has created a new school, I 
think at Oxford or Cambridge, about food security. So, there 
are a lot of people interested in making sure people can feed 
themselves, and you know, it is soil, seed, and water, you have 
got to have water.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Graham. I look forward to working with you on that. 
Are you familiar with the International Criminal Court (ICC) 
arrest warrant issued against Russian President Vladimir Putin?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Graham. Do you think that is sound?
    Secretary Blinken. I think we have all seen, Senator, the 
atrocities and war crimes committed in Ukraine.
    Senator Graham. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. And we all--we believe strongly as we 
have said at the outset----
    Senator Graham. I think the President said he thought that 
was a sound approach.
    Secretary Blinken. There needs to be accountability.
    Senator Graham. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. And the ICC is an----
    Senator Graham. What do they want to arrest him for?
    Secretary Blinken. The focus of the--as I understand it--
the focus is on the, in effect, abduction of children----
    Senator Graham. Right.
    Secretary Blinken [continuing]. From Ukraine, taking them 
to Russia, giving them to Russian----
    Senator Graham. Yes. So let us just stop for a second. 
There is an arrest warrant for Putin by the ICC, for kidnapping 
children in Ukraine, and taking them to Russia.
    Secretary Blinken. That is right.
    Senator Graham. Is that pretty much it, right?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Graham. If Putin came to the United States, for 
whatever reason, would we turn him over to the ICC?
    Secretary Blinken. Well, I can't get ahead of that, 
because, as I said, I would have to look at the laws, and 
those, as you know, we are not actually a party to the ICC, so 
I don't want to engage in that hypothetical, but----
    Senator Graham. I would encourage you, that if he came 
here, we should turn him over.
    Secretary Blinken. Now, I don't think he has any plans to 
travel here soon.
    Senator Graham. Yes. Well, would you encourage our European 
allies to turn him over?
    Secretary Blinken. I think that anyone who is a party to 
the court, and has obligations, should fulfill their 
obligations.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Are you aware that the Congress, 100 
to nothing, which is pretty rare around here, supported the 
idea of declaring Russia a state sponsor of terrorism under 
U.S. law?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Graham. I don't know how much more we can do to 
help you in that regard. Do you intend----
    Secretary Blinken. Could I just--can I just say on that?
    Senator Graham. Yes. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. I appreciate it. Well, we have as you 
know, multiple designations that focus on Russia's war crimes, 
atrocities, et cetera. The SST brings with it, also, I think, 
potentially, some unintended consequences----
    Senator Graham. So here is my question.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Graham. Are you going to designate Russia a state 
sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law? Do you intend to do that?
    Secretary Blinken. What we have been doing, Senator, as you 
know, I think, is working with you to look at a new designation 
that would go to a----
    Senator Graham. Well, but we sort of failed in that 
endeavor, and since we started, he has been--an arrest warrant 
has been issued-- what more do you have to do to be a state 
sponsor of terrorism?
    On China, the meeting between Xi and Putin: would you 
consider that a marriage of convenience, or a strategic 
alliance?
    Secretary Blinken. Perhaps a combination of both. I think 
you have got a--you do have a partnership. Remember, as you 
know, right before the Russian aggression, they met.
    Senator Graham. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. They talked about a partnership with no 
limits.
    Senator Graham. So let us just break that down a bit here, 
``with no limits'', the world is trying to put a cap on Russian 
oil.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Graham. The West; is that correct?
    Secretary Blinken. That is correct.
    Senator Graham. I think China just agreed to buy oil, as 
much as Russia can supply. They are undercutting our efforts 
there: do you agree with that?
    Secretary Blinken. They are, although, we see it as two 
things, Senator. With the oil cap, we try to accomplish two 
goals. One, reduce the revenues that Russia is getting from 
selling energy.
    Senator Graham. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. But at the same time keep enough energy 
on the market so that we don't have a crisis.
    Senator Graham. Sure.
    Secretary Blinken. I think we have largely accomplished 
that goal. Russian oil revenues are down as a result of the----
    Senator Graham. But China has made a pledge to buy all of 
the Russian oil they can buy, right, not at the cap price?
    Secretary Blinken. Well, we will see at what price they 
actually buy at.
    Senator Graham. The bottom line is China is working against 
us, when it comes to Russia: do you agree?
    Secretary Blinken. I think their diplomatic support, their 
political support, and to some extent material support for 
Russia, certainly goes against our interest in bringing this 
war to an end, in a way that is just----
    Senator Graham. You have publicly said that you had reason 
to believe that China may be considering providing lethal aid 
to Russia: is that correct?
    Secretary Blinken. That is correct.
    Senator Graham. If you provide lethal aid to a state 
sponsor of terrorism, that would be considered material support 
under U.S. law: is that correct?
    Secretary Blinken. I believe that is correct.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Don't you think it would be smart to 
tell China, you provide lethal aid to a state sponsor of 
terrorism, and they may be more deterred than if we just 
remained silent about that?
    Secretary Blinken. Senator, I have shared directly, with my 
Chinese counterpart the serious problem that China providing 
lethal material support to Russia for----
    Senator Graham. Do you think it is working? Do you think 
they will provide aid?
    Secretary Blinken. As we speak today, we have not seen them 
cross that line.
    Senator Graham. So my point is, that we made a mistake, I 
think, by not having pre-invasion sanctions. We should have 
supplied more weapons to Ukraine before the invasion to deter 
the war. We are at tipping point here. China is openly 
embracing Russia, they are undercutting everything the West is 
trying to do to isolate Russia. They are buying unlimited oil.
    I think now is the time, Mr. Secretary, to label Russia 
state sponsor of terrorism, because they are. Up the ante if 
China wants to continue to help Russia. Would you at least 
consider that as a deterrent possibility?
    Secretary Blinken. We want to look at every reasonable 
deterrent, but again, when it comes to the SST, and we should 
talk about this further, I think there are better ways to get 
at the same--at the same thing, that could have some of the----
    Senator Graham. Whatever those ways are, let us--we are 
over a year into this war. Let us do something. And I am just 
going to tell you, as a friend. I like you. I will try to work 
with you. I am not going to sit down on the sidelines any 
longer, and see Russia not labeled for who they are. They are 
terrorists. They are wreaking havoc all over Africa. We just 
got back from a trip to Africa.
    Through the Wagner Group, Russia committed immense war 
crimes in Syria, this is just a modus operandi. They just bomb 
the hell out of people, terrorize people, use rape as a weapon 
of war. And it is now to stand up and say: You are a terrorist 
state under U.S. law. And I think the sooner we do that, the 
better.
    Let us go to Mexico, real quick. And I will try to keep 
within my time, go over a couple minutes. Are there places in 
Mexico that the Government of Mexico does not have control?
    Secretary Blinken. I think you see significant insecurity 
in parts of----
    Senator Graham. Well, my question is, if their own 
Government----
    Secretary Blinken [continuing]. I am sure that there are 
individual places, communities, where the--break down.
    Senator Graham. Yes. Are there drug cartels in control of 
parts of Mexico, not the Government of Mexico?
    Secretary Blinken. I think it is fair to say, yes.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Do you agree with the following 
statement: that fentanyl coming from Mexico is killing 
Americans by the tens of thousands?
    Secretary Blinken. It is. And it is also killing Mexicans 
as well.
    Senator Graham. Yes. Well, do you agree it is now time to 
change our policy because it is not working? Or do you think it 
is working?
    Secretary Blinken. I think that, Senator, first of all, you 
are exactly right about the insecurity in Mexico. As I said, 
the Mexican people themselves are the number one victims of 
that insecurity. The Mexican Government have supporters 
working----
    Senator Graham. Are more Mexicans are dying of fentanyl 
poisoning than Americans?
    Secretary Blinken. Currently, no. But it is growing 
problem.
    Senator Graham. So how many have died in Mexico from 
fentanyl poisoning?
    Secretary Blinken. I don't have the exact numbers, but I am 
sure that is----
    Senator Graham. Well, 70,000 died last year----
    Secretary Blinken. That is correct.
    Senator Graham [continuing]. Alone, in the United States. 
Do you believe our policies toward drug cartels, and fentanyl 
coming from Mexico are working?
    Secretary Blinken. They need to do more. They need to be 
more effective.
    Senator Graham. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. Here is one way we can do that. One way 
we can do that, is making sure that we have, for example, the 
technology on our borders to detect and intercept the fentanyl. 
96 percent of the fentanyl coming into the United States is 
coming through legal ports of entry. We have the technology 
that can catch a lot of that.
    Senator Graham. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. We need to deploy it faster, that is 
exactly what we----
    Senator Graham. How about this idea. Rather than just 
interdicting at the border, we go to the source and declare 
Mexican drug cartels foreign terrorist organizations under U.S. 
law.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Graham. Would you consider that?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes, we would certainly consider that.
    Senator Graham. And that would help us with China, because 
if you provide material support to a foreign terrorist 
organization, you could be prosecuted in U.S. courts.
    Secretary Blinken. They are also transnational criminal 
organization, and that brings with it a number of sanctions----
    Senator Graham. That is what they are today?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes, and----
    Senator Graham. I want to up----
    Secretary Blinken [continuing]. It is not clear to me that 
the--again, that we would get additional tools of authorities, 
it is worth pointing out that----
    Senator Graham. We would with China, Mr. Secretary, 
Transnational Criminal Organizations cannot--material support 
doesn't bring in U.S. courts. For Foreign Terrorist 
Organizations (FTOs), material support for an FTO would capture 
in U.S. courts if you are a China company.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Graham. So please consider that. I would say our 
policy is not working. I want to introduce into the record a 
State Department travel advisory map that tells you where to go 
and not to go in Mexico. The red is getting redder, Mr. 
Secretary.
    Mexican President Obrador is going to call Chinese 
President Xi, great. I am not looking for a phone call from 
Mexico. I am looking for action on their part. I am willing to 
do a Plan Colombia-type effort with Mexico, but I am going to 
put the Mexican Government on notice, and your Department, when 
it comes to poisoning of America, we are going to take 
different action because what we are doing is not working.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Graham. This is not a confrontational statement, it 
is a statement of fact. More Americans are being poisoned by 
fentanyl from Mexico in a single year than we lost in the 
entire Vietnam War. And the leading cause of death in America, 
from 18 to 45 years old, is fentanyl poisoning.
    Secretary Blinken. And Senator, I----
    Senator Graham. Enough is enough.
    Secretary Blinken. I absolutely share your priority and 
focus on that.
    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. 
Secretary.
    Senator Coons. Chair Murray.

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATTY MURRAY

    Senator Murray. Well, thank you very much, Chair Coons, and 
Ranking Member Graham. I am really glad to join you as we kick 
off this subcommittee hearing on President Biden's budget 
request. We are really lucky in the Senate to have a Chair and 
a Ranking Member on this committee who both really know their 
stuff when it comes to foreign policy, and are so similarly 
committed to finding common ground for the good of this 
country.
    These hearings provide a really important opportunity for 
us to assess our country's needs as we write our funding bills 
for the year ahead.
    Vice Chair Collins, who is here today, and I, have made 
very clear we want to return to regular order, a goal I know 
that both you and the Ranking Member share, and many of our 
colleagues do as well. We have a responsibility to work in a 
timely way to write funding bills that will build a stronger 
economy, make our communities safer, and ensure we stay ahead 
of our global competitors.
    I think we all know that getting this done through regular 
order, for the first time in years, will be no walk in the 
park, but it will be worth it. So I am really glad to have both 
of you as partners in this effort, and I look forward to 
working with everyone on this subcommittee to provide the 
robust funding that these issues deserve.
    Now, this hearing offers an important reminder that when it 
comes to keeping our Nation safe, and competitive, and secure, 
defense spending is important, but it is only one part of the 
equation.
    After all, our strength here at home and across the world 
isn't just measured by the strength of our military, it is 
measured by our diplomacy, our influence abroad, and our 
strategic investments, which make the world, including our own 
Nation, safer and more secure.
    And that is why boosting investments in non-defense 
discretionary spending is so critical, because we are weaker, 
our families are more at risk, when we retreat from the world 
stage, and folks back home get that. They see every day how our 
world is more connected than ever, and how crises on the other 
side of the world have ramifications for their daily lives: 
like when supply chains are broken, and families can't get the 
products they need; or when small businesses and our growers 
are cut off from foreign markets that they rely on to make a 
living; or when viruses spread undetected, leading to 
outbreaks, and as we know, pandemics; or when the world becomes 
more hostile to women as their rights are attacked, and less 
free, as democracies are undermined; or when families become 
refugees, and flee their homes due to persecution and violence. 
The more we are engaged in the world now, the better we can 
address and prevent these challenges before they reach our 
door.
    But if we fail to invest in the State Department and the 
powerful diplomatic tools we have, if we don't keep our 
embassies well-staffed, Mr. Secretary, as you mentioned, if we 
don't invest in preventing conflict before it causes 
catastrophe, and promoting stability with humanitarian aid and 
development, if we don't stand up for democracy, and stand up 
to autocrats, and if we don't invest in global solutions to 
global challenges, like food security, and tackling the climate 
crisis--in short, if we stand down on the world stage, our 
adversaries and competitors will step up and fill that 
leadership void.
    We know China is already working to build relationships and 
alliances across the world by building infrastructure far 
beyond its borders. If we are going to stay competitive we have 
to continue making smart investments that make our allies and 
our partnerships stronger. And we know a global challenge, like 
the climate crisis, cannot be solved through unilateral action, 
it can only be solved through global cooperation, and that 
requires leadership.
    Chair Coons, I really appreciate your leadership in 
focusing on how we must address the climate crisis on the world 
stage, because we are constantly seeing new, alarming examples 
of how the climate crisis poses an immense threat to global 
security, and to our own national security: water scarcity, 
food scarcity, extreme weather events, don't just create 
humanitarian crises in a vacuum, they can destabilize entire 
regions, threatening our own security.
    And we have also seen how Russia has tried to use energy 
dependence to strengthen its hand in its brutal war against 
Ukraine, which is just one more reason it is so important that 
we invest in global solutions to the climate crisis that allow 
our allies be less reliant on our adversaries for energy.
    At the same time we have to keep in mind that when we 
strengthen our ties in Asia, when we support economic stability 
in Latin America, when we build up public health capacity in 
Africa, those investments pay dividends, including for all of 
us right here at home. And that is true for families across the 
country, and especially for my home State of Washington.
    My State is a hub of global trade, especially with Asia, 
and one of America's great gateways to the world. We welcome 
diplomats, and have numerous consulates in our State. We 
welcome refugees, and are one of the top five States when it 
comes to hosting families that have fled the conflict in 
Ukraine.
    And not only do we welcome students, and workers, and 
tourists, we engage with the world too, including the many 
Fulbright scholars, and students, and Peace Corps members who 
head out from Washington State to learn about other countries, 
and cultures, and build relationships, and strengthen 
communities. Our investments in these programs help create a 
world that is safer and more open to Americans.
    So Mr. Chairman, I will just end by noting the list of 
issues in this subcommittee are really critical, for our 
Nation, for our families, and they literally span the globe. 
But the bottom line is pretty simple, we cannot be a player on 
the world stage and keep our country safe and prosperous if we 
put ourselves on the sidelines. And there is just too much at 
stake in this moment to let that happen.
    We have to continue the work of leading a global coalition 
that holds Russia accountable for its cruel and unjust invasion 
of Ukraine. We have to continue standing with our Ukrainian 
allies, supporting refugees, and providing the support they 
need, especially as we see China stepping in to grow its 
influence, with Xi's visit to Moscow earlier this week.
    We have got to continue to be steadfast in our investments 
to counter these influences, and continue to lead by example.
    So Mr. Secretary, I welcome you here today. I look forward 
to working with you and the administration, and working with my 
colleagues on this subcommittee on a bipartisan funding bill 
for next year that provides robust investments for the State 
Department, so we can strengthen our ties, support our allies, 
and solidify our place as the leader of the free world.
    So I have used my minutes.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Murray. But Mr. Chairman just let me say, I am 
following this subcommittee very closely. And look forward to 
working with you on a bipartisan product for all of us to 
support. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Madam Vice 
Chair. I am so excited by the drive, the energy, the leadership 
that you are delivering, and look forward to spending lots of 
time together, on subcommittee hearings, on full committee 
hearings, on markups, and getting a work product out. And thank 
you for sharing with us the ways in which Washington, as I 
suspect we may now hear is also true for Maine, are parts of 
our Nation, that although thousands of miles apart, share a 
common connection to the world, to global trade, and a 
connection to our security.
    Madam Vice Chair.

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS

    Senator Collins. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am 
going to take the opposite approach of Chair Murray. I am going 
to submit some comments for the record, and go straight to 
questions.
    Senator Collins. So as usual, we are complementing one 
another.
    Let me start with Ukraine, Mr. Secretary. There are those 
who view our support of Ukraine, as an either-or proposition 
for our national security. And they argue that either the 
United States focuses on pushing back Russian aggression in 
Ukraine, or the United States focuses on countering the rising 
influence of China.
    I don't agree with that assessment. I view the two 
challenges as interconnected, and believe that Russia and China 
are working in concert to reshape the international order to 
our disadvantage.
    Two questions for you. First, what message would it send to 
China and Russia, were we to abandon Ukraine at this point? And 
second, please articulate the case for why our involvement in 
Ukraine is in America's national interest?
    Secretary Blinken. Madam Vice Chair, thank you very much 
for that question. First of all, I fully agree with you. And 
let me put it this way, because it does go--in effect, the 
second part of your question actually goes right to the first 
part. Why is this in our interest? Why is it profoundly in the 
interest of the United States, to do what we have been doing, 
which is to continue to stand with Ukraine, as it defends 
itself, against this Russian aggression, to continue to exert 
pressure on Russia, to end the aggression, and to strengthen 
our own alliance, defensive alliance, NATO, in case that 
aggression spreads?
    It is two reasons: fundamentally, first of all, I think 
Americans do not like not like to see big nations bullying 
smaller ones, that is something that sticks in our craw, and we 
see the horrific abuses and atrocities that are being 
committed, and that is something that, I think, Americans focus 
on very intensely.
    But fundamentally, the reason is this: If we allow the 
Russian aggression in Ukraine to go forward with impunity, if 
we allow the very basic rules of the road, for how countries 
relate to one another, that were established after two world 
wars, and that focus, among other things, on making sure that 
countries respect the territorial integrity of other countries, 
respect their independence, respect their sovereignty.
    If we allow that to be violated with impunity by Russia in 
Ukraine, we open a Pandora's box around the world, where would-
be aggressors everywhere look at this and say: If they can get 
away with it, I can too. And that is a world of conflict, that 
is a world of war, that is world that we have been in before, 
and we have had to come in and do something about it. But it is 
not a world that we want.
    So the stakes in Ukraine go well beyond Ukraine. And to 
your point, I think it has a profound impact in Asia, for 
example. Everyone is watching to see how we and the world 
respond to this aggression. And they will draw their lessons 
from it. One of the reasons that there are so many partners 
involved in this from Asia is precisely because, even though 
this is happening half-a-world away, they see the stakes for 
them.
    One of the leading countries in our coalition that support 
Ukraine is Japan, South Korea is playing an important role, 
Australia is too, and they see the stakes. I think if China is 
looking at this, and they are looking at it very carefully, 
they will draw lessons for how the world comes together, or 
doesn't, to stand up to this aggression.
    Senator Collins. Thank you. And let me encourage you, and 
the other members of the administration, including the 
President, to make that case to the American people, much more 
forcefully, so that we do not see this continuing troubling 
decline in public support for our efforts in Ukraine. It goes 
way beyond doing the right thing from a moral or a humanitarian 
viewpoint. It is very much in our interest.
    Let me follow up, to some extent, on Senator Graham's 
questions on fentanyl.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Collins. We have recently had a tragic case in 
Maine, where a 14-year-old girl with no history of drug abuse, 
died from taking a pill that was laced with fentanyl, so this 
is a tragedy that affects each and every one of our States. The 
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement account, 
works to reduce the production and trafficking of fentanyl, and 
other drugs, through its drug supply reduction program.
    The President's budget proposes $20 million for this 
program, which is only a $3 million increase above this year's 
level, despite the flood of fentanyl, the precursors of which 
come from China, go to Mexico, and then into this country to 
poison our people.
    So this disappoints me, and I ask you: do you think you are 
requesting sufficient funding? If you do, what other measures 
are you taking to specifically address the threat of fentanyl 
flowing into our country?
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you very much for that question, 
because I absolutely share the priority that you, Senator 
Graham, I think everyone on this committee, is putting on this 
problem.
    As Senator rightly said, the number one killer of 
Americans, 18 to 49, is fentanyl, synthetic opioids. And so 
this is, it needs to be, a national priority. And I think we--
the way that we are approaching this is really a whole-of-
spectrum approach, by which I mean, that obviously we are doing 
work at home to try to reduce demand, protect our own people, 
get them the treatment, and antidotes they need, but that is 
not the answer, it is part of it, but it is not the answer.
    We talked a minute ago about border security and 
technology, where we can do a lot more to effectively intercept 
things coming into the country. But that is not enough. We have 
to be, and we are, working to disrupt the transnational 
criminal organizations that are engaged in moving this--making 
this stuff, and moving this stuff, and we are.
    We need to be working with, as we are, with Mexico to take 
down the labs, to take down the enterprises. And we need, to 
your point, to be more effective in preventing the diversion of 
illicit precursors into the illicit fabrication of synthetic 
opioids, like fentanyl.
    So we have done a number of things to intensely focus on 
this with Mexico. We actually are working in very close 
collaboration. They have now, you know, over the last year, 
arrested dozens of first- and second-tier transnational 
criminal organization leads. They have seized record amounts of 
fentanyl, but it is a huge sea. But that is going up. They 
disrupted production facilities with our assistance.
    We have our financial intelligence unit working with theirs 
to disrupt the financing of these networks, and we have now, as 
a result of work that I did with my colleagues, a Joint 
Synthetic Drug Action Plan with Mexico that expands cooperation 
with them, from law enforcement to the regulatory agencies in 
Mexico, to the trade and health organizations that are really 
important.
    Second, more broadly, for the first time, I just came, a 
couple of months ago, from the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting, 
in preparation for the leaders. For the first time the United 
States got this on the full agenda of the G20, so these are the 
most important economies in the world that have a real role and 
stake in different ways in this, and we will be establishing a 
working group in the G20 to work on this.
    Third, from the perspective of the State Department as 
well, one of the things that we are working on is building a 
coalition on a voluntary basis at first, to tackle another 
aspect of this problem, and that is the illicit diversion of 
legal precursors. This is a big problem, as you know.
    There are things that we can do much more effectively: 
sharing information, labeling, putting in place know your 
customer protocols, around the world including with China, to 
make sure that companies that are, again, involved in the 
production of perfectly illicit precursors, do not have them 
diverted into the fabrication of synthetic opioids. So all of 
that we are coming together.
    Now, as to the resources, Madam Vice Chair, very happy to 
work with you, very closely, to make sure that we are properly 
resourced for this. I could not agree with you more. This is a 
number one priority.
    Senator Collins. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Madam Vice Chair. My strong 
suspicion is that an amendment to increase the funding would 
get unanimous support.
    Senator Shaheen.
    Senator Shaheen. Yes. I would be happy to cosponsor it.
    Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here. And I want to 
begin by thanking the State Department and the President for 
your request in the budget to support those people who have 
been affected by anomalous health incidents. As we know, that 
continues to be an issue for people affected, and I appreciate 
the continued work of the State Department.
    I was also pleased to see the President's budget include 
20,000 additional special immigrant visas for our Afghan 
allies, you mentioned that as part of your remarks. And I 
understand the Department is undertaking an effort to review 
our withdrawal from Afghanistan last year. I hope that that is 
a review that also considers the implication on Afghan women 
and girls----
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Shaheen[continuing]. Who have been, again, once 
again, had their rights stolen by the Taliban regime after our 
departure, who were not, as we have heard, have real concerns 
about what their future holds.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Shaheen. So can you give us an update on this 
effort, and is it going to be shared with the members of 
Congress?
    Secretary Blinken. So for the after-action review, and I 
think I mentioned at the very start of this, before you were 
here, yes. In short, yes, we have been working on that review, 
this was a commitment that I made very early on after the 
withdrawal to make sure that we learned the lessons from our 
part in that, what we got right, what we got wrong, what we 
need to learn from it. We brought in very experienced retired 
senior Foreign Service Officers to run that process. We did 
that.
    Other agencies have done similar efforts. We have been 
working in recent months to bring all of that together, to 
understand what the common lessons learned should be. A bottom 
line is this, we will be making those reports available, 
sharing that information with Congress within the next three 
weeks.
    Senator Shaheen. You wouldn't like to preview what it is 
going to say, would you?
    Secretary Blinken. Well, I don't want to get ahead of it, 
except to say that we have been looking at, just from the 
perspective of the State Department, I obviously can't speak to 
other agencies, about how we can be more effectively organized 
to deal with complex emergencies in advance. And we have 
definitely learned lessons from this experience that I think 
can make us more effective going forward, but we will share in 
detail what we have learned.
    Senator Shaheen. Well, thank you. I will look forward to 
seeing that. And one of the places where I think that kind of a 
more coordinated strategy would be really important, is in the 
Black Sea region.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Shaheen. And the invasion of Ukraine really pointed 
out, with the closing of shipping lanes, and the impact on food 
security globally, just how important that region is. And as I 
am sure you are aware, we had language in the last Omnibus and 
Defense Authorization Bill, to ask the administration to 
develop a comprehensive approach to the Black Sea. I think it 
should include, not just national security issues, which we saw 
with the downing of our drone, how important those are in the 
region, but also economic and democracy support for what is 
happening in the region.
    So can you talk about where the administration is in 
developing that kind of a strategy, when we can expect it, and 
how it is helping to--helping us think about our approach to 
the region?
    Secretary Blinken. Senator, I very much appreciate your 
focus and leadership on this. And bottom line up front, we will 
produce that strategy. I think there is actually a deadline in 
the----
    Senator Shaheen. Right.
    Secretary Blinken [continuing]. Legislation of June. And we 
will produce it by then. And I couldn't agree with you more. It 
requires, and we are focused on a much more comprehensive 
approach to the Black Sea region. As you know, larger than 
California, it has got six countries on its coast. Three of 
them are our NATO allies, others like Ukraine are obviously are 
important friends to the United States.
    And to your point, the strategy will focus, not just on the 
security aspects, but on promoting political engagement, on 
promoting economic cooperation, including strengthened energy 
security, which is critical to all of these countries in a 
variety of ways. As well as building democratic resilience 
because they are in a challenged neighborhood.
    And one of things that we have done, and the reason we want 
to make sure that we get this right is, we have gotten inputs 
from some of these countries, we want to make sure that they 
are factored into our strategy. For example, our Romanian 
colleagues have done, as you know, very well, have done a lot 
of thinking, and a brought a lot of focus to this. They shared 
with us their own views and plans, and that is something that 
we are factoring in. The bottom line though is, we will have it 
to you by June.
    Senator Shaheen. Well, I can tell you, I was in the region 
in both Romania and Georgia, the end of February, and there was 
a great deal of interest in the fact that we were beginning to 
think about that region more comprehensively, and really 
looking also at the economic potential that is there. In 
Georgia they are looking at what they are calling the ``Middle 
Corridor'' that would provide an opportunity to get around 
Russia in terms of energy.
    And I think as we look at countries like Georgia, where I 
am disappointed by some backsliding in the government, but 
where the people are very clearly committed to looking towards 
Europe, to looking at NATO, we need to think about how we can 
better support them. Our ambassador, their Ambassador Degnan, 
has done an excellent job.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Shaheen. As I was saying to the Chairman, thinking 
about where we put in Development Finance Corporation Office in 
that region, Georgia, I think has some real potential for that. 
It is something that could be very important.
    Let me just end by going back to the fentanyl question, 
because it has been such a huge issue for us in New Hampshire, 
and for everybody, I think, on this committee. We passed, 
Senator Portman and I worked on a legislation called the 
FENTANYL Results Act, to try and give the State Department more 
resources to work with other countries who might want to help 
us address fentanyl coming into the United States.
    Are there resources you need to do that legislation, and if 
so, what do you need? Let us know what you need so that we 
can----
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Shaheen [continuing]. So that we can ensure that 
that happens.
    Secretary Blinken. I really welcome working with you on 
that, because, indeed, one of the things that we are doing, is 
working to build a coalition of countries that can work 
together more effectively to deal with this challenge 
internationally, particularly again, when it comes to the 
diversion of licit precursors into illicit production of 
fentanyl.
    We started to do that, as I mentioned, at the G20, but 
there may be other ways that will be effective in building that 
out. That may require some additional resources. It will be 
great to work with you on that. Thank you.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Shaheen.
    Senator Rubio.
    Senator Rubio. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for 
coming in, we appreciate it.
    It strikes me--I know you like history. Is that one of 
your--isn't that one of your majors? Did you study that?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Rubio. Yes. And I think history is always 
instructive. One of the things that is most interesting about 
history is if you look back at these pivot moments in human 
history, the people that lived through them didn't realize that 
is what was happening. When you are living a hinge moment in 
history, you know, you are busy with everyday life, and 
everything else that is going on, and sometimes you don't 
entirely perceive it.
    So I am pleased, as I read the beginning of your statement 
here, and I heard it before I came in on the broadcast, where 
we meet at an inflection point, the post-Cold War world is 
over, and there is an intense competition underway to determine 
what comes next.
    So it is an acknowledgment that this is not what it was 
like 10 years ago, 5 years ago.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Rubio. Very different. And that is important. I 
would argue that we are beyond simply competitive, and I don't 
understand why we talk about strategic competition, and I don't 
say this with any joy in my heart, but simply because it is 
sort of par for the course in human history. I think we are 
entering, perhaps the beginning of a period of conflict, which 
doesn't necessarily always mean military conflict, but conflict 
nonetheless. We have an all-out war in Europe.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Rubio. That is most clearly a conflict, and it has 
been a globalized one. People call it a ``Proxy War'', but it 
has been globalized.
    We saw that very clearly yesterday with Xi's visit to 
Moscow, but beyond that, sort of the way the world is aligned 
in different ways. We have seen the rise of, by necessity, 
militarization. Germany, Japan, nothing that we are against, 
frankly, because given the necessities of the world, but this 
post-Cold War--post-World War II Order in which both countries 
decided that they were going to be less martial, less military. 
Necessity has changed it for both of them.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Rubio. A positive development for our alliance, but 
nonetheless a reality. We have these nine Eastern European 
countries that are even more hawkish than the rest of Europe, 
geography puts them right at the edge of Russia's aggression, 
when they can see very clearly what is happening.
    We have the very clear outlines of this emerging conflict: 
the U.S., the West, the democracies, and an alliance, the 
China-Russia Alliance, they don't want to call it that, but 
that is what it is, in conjunction with others like Iran, 
potentially, participating as well. And then these dozens and 
dozens of developing, so-called, the ``Non-Aligned Nations'', 
all trying to cut deals for themselves; we saw that with Saudi 
Arabia, you see it throughout Africa, et cetera.
    And then on top of that, in this emerging block of two 
nations between, it is not simply these military alliances, we 
are seeing the rise of alternatives to the SWIFT Banking 
System, to the U.S. dollar, ways to--the growth of countries 
that now have a vested interest in figuring out how to evade 
sanctions.
    You see supply chain diversity, Europe is diversifying 
where it gets its energy, and the rest of the world is 
diversifying, because I think there is the understanding that 
the market is responding to the fact that we are entering a 
period, a conflict. It is in that vein, given all of that, that 
I am really concerned about whether we can continue to afford 
to do some of the things that we are doing. I don't mean from a 
dollar standpoint, but from a geopolitical standpoint.
    So for example, last summer the State Department released a 
report attacking the Solomon Islands for their stance on same-
sex marriage. It alienated their partners there. The next week 
they signed a Mutual Security Agreement with Beijing and the 
Pacific, and the Prime Minister declined to participate in the 
commemoration of the memorial marking the Battle of 
Guadalcanal. That is just one example.
    I mean, we could go--I could take 10, 15 minutes to go 
through each of these here, and point to different such places 
where we have sort of aligned ourselves in that way.
    Haven't we now reached a point where, frankly, we have to 
understand we are entering a period of geopolitical competition 
bordering on conflict, diplomatic conflict, economic conflict; 
and God forbid, potentially military conflict, and as a result 
need to govern ourselves accordingly? Not that these values, or 
whatever our values may be don't matter, but our approach has 
to look very different than it did 5, 10, 15 years ago when, 
frankly, the U.S. was the world's sole superpower.
    And we had, in many cases, the luxury to be able to go 
through and do some of these things, because it is not that 
these issues don't matter, it is that none of these issues are 
going to matter if 15, 10, or 5 years from now we live in a 
world in which the dominant economic military and technological 
power in the world is in the hands of authoritarian regimes, 
who frankly resemble what the vast majority of human history 
looks like. And that is, led by despots where there are no 
individual rights, and all these things that have made, not 
just our prosperity and freedom possible here, but the world a 
better place.
    Isn't it time for us to view the world through the lens, 
frankly, of the beginnings, the early stages of a geopolitical 
conflict?
    Secretary Blinken. Senator I share your--I share your basic 
analysis. And I think that, in a sense that is exactly what we 
are doing. We have worked from day one to do two things, 
foundational things: One is to support important investments in 
ourselves, which I talked about a little earlier, to make sure 
that we are as strong and competitive as we can be. And I 
think, thanks to Congress, we have made those historic 
investments. And the CHIPS and Science Act is maybe the best 
example.
    But second, we have worked from day one both to reengage, 
rejuvenate, and strengthen our existing alliances and 
partnerships, but also build new ones, new coalitions of 
countries, and even beyond countries, that are fit-for-purpose 
in dealing with different parts of the challenge that I think 
you described very, very well.
    Just to give you one quick example. When we are dealing 
with the challenge posed to supply chains around the world, to 
make sure that we have, and benefit from, diversified and 
resilient supply chains. We brought together countries in a 
coalition to do that, to in many cases, near-shore and friend-
shore, to have early warning systems in place if they are being 
disrupted. And also, through something called the Mineral 
Security Partnership, to make sure that the United States and 
likeminded countries are focused on ensuring that we are able 
to invest in, effectively, some of the critical minerals that 
are so important to so much of what we are doing.
    When it comes to our engagement in the Asia-Pacific region, 
the Indo-Pacific, we have put that on full throttle. We have 
reopened an Embassy, as you know, in the Solomon Islands. We 
are looking at other places in the Pacific Islands, where we 
can make sure that we are present in ways that we haven't been 
in recent years, precisely because we are engaged in a 
competition.
    And I could go down the list of different collections of 
fit-for-purpose partnerships that we built to deal with exactly 
the world that that you are describing. I do think, and you 
said it, that as we do that, the values that unite us are also 
usually important to the strength and solidarity of these 
alliances of partnerships.
    Now, not every country that we need to be working with is 
in the same place that we are. I think we recognize that, and 
we need to make sure that we are adjusting and flexible enough 
for that.
    The last thing is this: There are a number of countries 
that are looking, as you know, very carefully and what is 
happening, making their own decisions, in some sense making 
their own bets about which direction they are going to go in. 
And from my perspective this is less about saying to them: You 
have to choose, and more offering them a choice. If we are able 
to do that, for example, in being able to catalyze real 
infrastructure investment that is a race to the top, not a race 
to the bottom, they are going to choose us.
    We also have to have some strategic patience. There are 
countries that have had long-standing, for decades, 
relationships, for example, with Russia, where moving away from 
that, as they want to do, is not like flipping a light switch, 
it is moving an aircraft carrier, and we have to work with them 
to do that.
    But I share the basic picture that you have painted, and 
really welcome working with you to figure out the most 
effective ways to deal with it. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Rubio, I couldn't agree 
more that that is one of the core arguments for robustly 
resourcing the State Department and the USAID, is to make sure 
we are meeting this moment.
    Senator Murphy.
    Senator Murphy. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good to 
see you, Mr. Secretary.
    The eyes of the world and the nation are rightly focused on 
Ukraine, on our broad set of competition, challenges with 
China; the Middle East always gets an outsized share of 
attention from this country and this Congress. But I want to 
thank you for the work that your diplomats have done to achieve 
two preliminary, but very important, smaller scale diplomatic 
agreements in the past several weeks.
    First, the Windsor Framework, which the United States had a 
great interest in, to make sure that peace is preserved in 
Northern Ireland ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Good 
Friday Agreement, and the Normalization Agreement between 
Kosovo and Serbia. The team that you have in place in that 
region is absolutely exceptional. Well, that is the beginning 
of what we hope is more accommodations between those two 
countries, a really important step. So I just wanted to 
congratulate you and your team on the work that you have done 
on those two important achievements.
    I want to turn your attention to the Global Engagement 
Center.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Murphy. Because this is something you and I have 
talked about, and I appreciate the fact that we have continued 
to scale up the size of the Global Engagement Center, and that 
your budget requests another double-digit percentage increase. 
I am of the belief that the GEC needs to take a primary, rather 
than secondary role when it comes to the way in which we 
counter misinformation around the world. I think, often, the 
Department of Defense which has a budget that dwarfs that of 
the GEC, doesn't always have the sensitivities that the State 
Department does about what messages work and what doesn't.
    But what concerns me more is that we have ahead of us, the 
reauthorization of the GEC, we have got to put it back on the 
books, and there is really no way to combat Russian 
misinformation, their propaganda efforts, which are integral to 
their campaign against Ukraine; or China's efforts to expand 
its reach, without the GEC.
    So I just wanted you--I want to sneak in at least one more 
question, but ask you for a minute to talk about what impact it 
would have if we were not able to extend the GEC's authorities 
beyond the end of 2024?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. And really, thank you for raising 
that. And also, thank you for your leadership on this.
    And this is a front in the conflict that Senator Rubio was 
just talking about. That is information. And we have 
competitors, adversaries, who are using information, or more 
accurately, misinformation and disinformation, against us, 
virtually every minute of the day, and against our allies and 
partners, both to drive wedges between us, and also to 
misinform publics in profound ways.
    The GEC, for us, is a critical tool in actually being able 
to deal with that. And as you know, what it is doing is working 
with other agencies to direct, to lead, to synchronize, to 
coordinate, our efforts to understand these trends in foreign 
malign actors trying to spread disinformation and propaganda 
outside of the United States; and both to understand it, to 
expose it, to share that information with others, and to help 
them develop tools to combat it. We have campaigns through the 
GEC to--as I said, to expose, to educate, to mitigate 
disinformation.
    It is now the premier information sharing platform 
internationally. For this we have dozens of countries that are 
participating with us, among other things. Just to cite a few 
examples: we have exposed through the GEC, Russian websites 
that have been pushing misinformation, disinformation, 
including about Ukraine, again in countries around the world; 
disinformation coming from China in third countries about 
elections, again, about Russia's war of aggression against 
Ukraine. We have done tremendous work, I think, doing open 
source mapping of some of the use that China has made of 
surveillance technology and data collection, and so on. I could 
go on, but the point is, it is a very effective vehicle for 
doing this, and if we lose that we are, in effect, disarming 
ourselves in this aspect of the competition.
    Senator Murphy. Here, here. And I hope that those of us who 
have worked in a bipartisan way to support the GEC, will 
continue to do that.
    I wanted to turn your attention to North Africa for a 
moment. Senator Coons has led the effort in trying to increase 
our ability to operate in fragile environments, and there are a 
number of them in North Africa, one of them is Libya. Your 
budget requests a 6 percent increase in worldwide security 
protection funding for local forces to make sure that we have a 
diplomatic presence in dangerous places; and few more dangerous 
places than Libya.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Murphy. But other countries are reopening their 
diplomatic presence there. Senator Risch and I have led an 
effort to rewrite the Accountability Review Board process to 
try to give your folks a little bit more reason to reengage in 
those fragile places.
    I just worry that without a presence there in 2023, we are 
going to have a hard time protecting our equities and a lot of 
taxpayer dollars that have been spent there. Do you have--with 
this additional funding that you have put in the budget; do you 
have any timetable for our ability to reopen the Embassy in 
Libya?
    Secretary Blinken. Senator, I can't give you a timetable, 
other than to say that it is something we are very actively 
working on. And like you, I want to see us be able to 
reestablish an ongoing presence in Libya. There is also an 
important moment where, through the work of the UN Envoy, there 
may be, emphasize, ``may be'', a path forward to moving Libya 
in a better direction, including getting elections for a 
legitimate government.
    And our diplomats are deeply engaged in that, but obviously 
it would be a lot easier and more effective if they were on the 
ground day in day out. So we are working on it. We want to work 
with you, work with this committee, on what would be necessary 
to support that.
    Senator Murphy. And lastly, on Tunisia.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Murphy. I know that you are just as concerned as 
this committee is, about the dramatic turn in Tunisia away from 
democracy, an 11 turnout in the so-called ``elections''. It 
seems to me that President Saied has made up his mind to move 
away from a success story of democracy in Tunisia, towards a 
neo-autocracy.
    It seems that your budget, you know, is a bit of a middling 
ground, and maybe that is where you want to be, cutting 
economic funding, maintaining military funding, but then also 
opening up the possibility of additional military funding if 
Tunisia, quote ``shows signs of a return to democratic 
governance.'' I kind of feel like they have made their 
decision, and I think that our funding and our policy should 
reflect that, but your budget suggests that you still have hope 
that Tunisia can return to the rule of law; is that correct?
    Secretary Blinken. Hope is always important, but of course, 
it has to be grounded in reality. I have met with President 
Saied on a number of occasions, including most recently, I 
guess, the Africa Leaders Summit, at the end of last year. We 
are engaged with the Tunisian Government. We are indeed 
concerned about what we have seen over the last year.
    There is another aspect of this that is critically 
important that also goes to our budget, which is the most 
critical thing they can do on the economic side, is actually 
get an IMF agreement. And we have been strongly encouraging 
them to do that because the economy risks falling off the deep 
end. So we need to see that, but we also want to see steps 
taken to put Tunisia fully back on the democratic path it was 
on.
    Senator Murphy. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you Senator Murphy. One of the things 
we could do to help with public diplomacy is confirm Elizabeth 
Allen to the Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. But forgive me. Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Chairman Coons.
    Secretary Blinken, welcome, it is good to see you again.
    Secretary Blinken. Good to see you.
    Senator Hagerty. A number of things to get through, 
Secretary, so I am going to move pretty quickly. The first one 
I would like to touch on: this past year, Senator Cardin and I 
passed a law to create a Commission on Reform and Modernization 
of the Department of State, via the 2023 NDAA.
    This new law authorizes the commission to conduct a 
comprehensive review of the State Department, and to offer 
specific legislative proposals for modernizing the Department. 
And funding the Commission will be one of my top SFOPS 
appropriations priorities this year.
    Secretary Blinken, if the committee includes in our 
appropriation for the Commission on Reform and Modernization of 
the Department of State, do you commit to cooperating fully 
with this commission, on all matters described in the 
underlying law that created it?
    Secretary Blinken. In short, yes. And indeed, one of things 
I will just say very quickly, Senator, is: I think we have been 
looking as well, and talking to your team about recommendations 
for that. And we very much want to make sure that we provide 
the support to be able to do it.
    Senator Hagerty. Excellent. We look forward to working with 
you on it too.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Hagerty. As Senator Rubio mentioned, we do face new 
and evolving challenges every day, and I think that 
modernization of the Department will help us address those 
challenges. So thank you for that commitment.
    Let me turn to another area that is very troubling. It is 
an issue related to our neighbor at our southern border, 
President Lopez Obrador continues to take arbitrary and 
punitive actions against U.S. businesses operating in Mexico.
    So my first question is, whether you are aware of the 
Mexican Military's recent seizure of a U.S.-owned Deepwater 
Port that is on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico?
    Secretary Blinken. I am not sure that I am aware of that 
particular seizure. And when did this happen?
    Senator Hagerty. It just recently happened in the past few 
weeks.
    Secretary Blinken. Happy to follow up with you on that.
    Senator Hagerty. I would like to do that. In that 
situation, it concerns me that the Mexican Government has put 
its Military in charge of constructing a section of the Tren 
Maya Railway that is near this recently seized port. And the 
bigger concern is the fact that China may be involved in 
building sections of that railway. The Chinese have bragged 
that the China Communications Construction Corporation is 
heavily involved in providing key materials for the railway. 
You probably are aware of----
    Secretary Blinken. Just if I could ask, just as a point of 
information. There is the case, and I am not sure if this same 
one, of Vulcan Materials.
    Senator Hagerty. That is the case.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. I am sorry. I didn't, I didn't 
associate. Yes. That I am aware of, and share the concern about 
that, and we have been asking the Mexican Authorities, local 
authorities as well national authorities, about the military 
and police presence there. So this is a deep concern. I think 
as a practical matter as well, cases like this can very 
negatively impact Mexico's effort to attract future investment 
from the United States, and any other countries.
    Senator Hagerty. Absolutely.
    Secretary Blinken. So yes. I am sorry. I didn't----
    Senator Hagerty. No. I think that is a grave concern, as 
you just described, that Mexico would take this sort of 
arbitrary and very detrimental action against U.S. assets. I 
mean, the rule of law is critical to the relationship, and I am 
just shocked that President Lopez Obrador is operating in this 
manner. I think the even deeper shock though, is the concern 
that a Chinese company is involved in building a section of the 
railway nearby.
    I also understand that this company that they are using is 
deeply involved in building Chinese military infrastructure, 
they are involved in militarizing the islands in the South 
China Sea, that China has poured concrete into the ocean to 
build. I think the other thing I hope we can investigate is 
whether the Chinese are involved in financing this.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Hagerty. There are deep concerns there. We have 
got, potentially, Chinese companies working with the Mexican 
Military to take adverse actions on U.S. assets, and in 
particular, seizing a deepwater port in that location. I would 
be interested in your opinion whether this would be in the 
interest of the Chinese Communist Party to have control of this 
port.
    Secretary Blinken. I think it, theoretically, would be. And 
it would certainly not be in the interest of Mexico. One of the 
things that we have worked actively with Mexico on, is making 
sure that, in other areas, for example, in the telecom sector, 
that they focus on making sure they have trusted vendors 
engaged in their system, because we know the challenges to 
their own sovereignty, when you don't have a trusted vendor in 
your telecom system.
    Senator Hagerty. It is a deep concern.
    Secretary Blinken. And this is something I must say that 
President Lopez Obrador seems seized with, but I would welcome, 
first of all, making sure we have all the information that you 
have about this particular case, and sharing with your team 
what we know.
    Senator Hagerty. We will exchange information.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Hagerty. And we may even have an opportunity to 
discuss it further this afternoon, at the SFRC.
    I would like to turn to another area, and that again, 
relates to China, and the situation with Taiwan. In 2023, this 
year, February, CIA Director Burns said that, ``As a matter of 
assessment, China seems to be capable of conducting an invasion 
by 2027 if so ordered.'' Do you agree with Director Burns' 
assessment?
    Secretary Blinken. I agree with his assessment, yes.
    Senator Hagerty. Time is not on our side, Secretary, 
especially when we have a $19 billion arms backlog to Taiwan. 
That is why I was proud to contribute to and vote for the 
Taiwan Enhancement Resilience Act, TERA, the Security 
Assistance Authorization Law that Senators Bob Menendez and Jim 
Risch passed into law via the 2023 NDAA.
    The Bipartisan Menendez Law annually authorizes as much as 
2 billion in grants in foreign military financing to Taiwan 
between now and 2027. I was deeply disappointed, however, to 
see that the President's proposed budget this year included 
only 113 million in new FMF lines for emergency foreign policy 
priorities, far short of the $2 billion target.
    This 113 million in the President's proposed budget, 
assumes a mere 16 million as a baseline for foreign military 
financing in the Indo-Pacific.
    So my question, Secretary, is: Why did the State 
Department's budget request for foreign military financing 
exclude funding for this bipartisan law?
    Secretary Blinken. Well, Senator as you point out, we do 
have, a part of our request, the emerging priorities fund 
globally, which as you rightly said, is about $113 million in 
the budget. When it comes to Taiwan, you know, FMF is one tool, 
we appreciate the authority, we also appreciate the drawdown 
authority, which we are looking at. But we have looked at how 
we can be most effective in supporting Taiwan in its defense.
    As you know, the State Department has notified just over 
the past decade or so, nearly $40 billion in foreign military 
sales to Taiwan, going back just between 2019, and today it has 
been about $21 billion. I have signed out more cases than any 
Secretary of State in history for Taiwan. Taiwan also increased 
its own defense budget, by 11 percent, giving it the additional 
means to buy equipment necessary for its defense.
    Senator Hagerty. Back to the original question, Mr. 
Secretary.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Hagerty. I am sorry. The time is so tight.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Hagerty. But to the original question, the budget 
is far short of what you have been authorized. My question now 
is, whether the PRC has said to you, or to anybody that works 
at the State Department, or any of our diplomats, that there is 
some sort of red line involved with us stepping up our Foreign 
Military Financing?
    Secretary Blinken. No. And to the extent they would ever 
try to say anything like that. That is not something that we 
would obviously take into account. As I said, I signed out more 
cases than any previous Secretary of State, the challenge that 
we have is--I think you have pointed to, is we have a backlog, 
a very significant backlog that has built up.
    This fundamentally goes to production challenges that we 
have. I know that we are working on, on a bipartisan basis, 
working with industry to build up that production capacity. 
That is the long pole in the tent, and we need to address it.
    Senator Hagerty. I am very familiar with foreign military 
sales process.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Hagerty. And I would just say this, we learn to--we 
have an opportunity for deterrence with Ukraine, we didn't take 
it. We have the opportunity here, the Menendez law, actually, 
is aimed at providing that opportunity to create deterrence 
there that could be significant. I encourage, and look forward 
to working with you to do everything we can in that regard.
    Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes, thank you.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Secretary, great to see you. And thank you for your 
support for the men and women at the State Department, 
including the Foreign Service as well as the Civil Service.
    A few years ago I teamed up with my colleague, Senator 
Sullivan, and we passed, with the support of members of this 
committee and the Senate, the Foreign Service Families Act, 
which is designed to help us continue to retain and to recruit 
the finest diplomatic corps in the world.
    We are in the implementation process. My staff just met 
with your team yesterday. We are pleased with the progress that 
has being made. And I am just asking for your assurance today 
that we will continue to implement those parts that are still 
in progress?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. Absolutely, because it is critical 
that we be able to attract and retain the best talent 
available, this is an important component of that because this 
is something that you have known and lived more than, or as 
much as anyone. This is a family enterprise. It is not simply 
the Foreign Service Officer that is there, it is the entire 
family. So we want to make sure that we are finding ways, 
through the Act to support them, to create greater opportunity 
for them, because that is the most effective way to attract and 
retain people.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you Mr. Secretary. Let me turn 
now to the recent meeting between Putin and President Xi, which 
took place, of course, just days after the ICC confirmed what 
we knew, which is that Putin was a war criminal, this case 
based on the fact that they have abducted Ukrainian children 
and taken them forcefully to Russia.
    You know, President Xi has reiterated the fact that that 
relationship between Russia and China knows, quote, ``No 
limits. The friendship knows no limits''. You and others in the 
administration have warned of the possibility that China would 
provide--start providing material----
    Secretary Blinken. Right.
    Senator Van Hollen [continued]: Military support to Russia 
in its fight against Ukraine, and that that would be a red line 
that would trigger severe economic consequences in the form of 
sanctions. I am glad you have established that very clearly. In 
order for that to be effective we need to make sure our allies 
and partners are on board.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Van Hollen. That includes our European partners. It 
also includes our democratic partners, like South Korea, Japan, 
Australia, others in East Asia, and around the world. So my 
question is, do we have a break the glass plan? Because what we 
don't want to see happen is if China were to provide military 
assistance that we are, you know, all fluttering around trying 
to figure out the way forward. Obviously imposing economic 
sanctions on Chinese entities is tougher than on Russian 
entities, given the more interconnected nature of the 
economies. But do we have a break-the-glass plan with our 
partners in the event China were to provide military assistance 
to Russia?
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you Senator. Let me say two things 
quickly about this. First, as you noted, going back to day-one 
of the Russian aggression we have been very clear with Beijing 
about the serious problem that any material lethal support to 
Russia, for the Russian against Ukraine would pose for us, and 
we believe for countries around the world. President Biden 
shared this directly with President Xi about three weeks into 
the aggression when they spoke by video conference. We have 
reiterated that.
    And as we have seen them consider it more actively in 
recent months, we have doubled down in making clear to them the 
serious problem that this would pose. But what is important is 
this, and it is to your point, it is not just us. When we 
shared with allies and partners some of the information we had 
about the act of consideration that China was giving to 
providing this lethal material support to Russia, this 
galvanized a number of other countries, all of whom directly 
engaged senior Chinese leadership on the question.
    And so we are actively talking to them about what it is we 
would do in the event that that happened. But my hope is that 
China having heard, not just from us, but from many countries, 
including countries with which it is trying to carry more 
favorable relations, that it heard them, and heard us, and will 
not cross that line.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, Mr. Secretary, I appreciate that. 
I just think it is going to be really important that we have in 
place a specific plan with our partners so that we are ready to 
go, and that China knows we are ready to go, because the 
deterrent effect of that, I think, depends on their clearly 
understanding the impact.
    If I could turn now to the Israeli-Palestinian issue; since 
the new Israeli Government was formed, high-level members of 
our Government have visited Israel, including yourself. Just a 
few days ago, President Biden had a phone call with Prime 
Minister Netanyahu. The readout from that call indicated that 
President Biden underscored the need to quote, ``Maintain the 
viability of the two-state solution,'' unquote, and the 
importance of abiding by the two agreements that the United 
States helped to recently broker between Israelis and 
Palestinians, at Aqaba, and later at Sharm el-Sheikh.
    Those agreements committed Israel to, I quote, ``Stop 
discussions of any more settlement units for 4 months, and stop 
authorization of any outposts for 6 months.'' Within days of 
the Aqaba Agreement, as you as know, President--Prime Minister 
Netanyahu rushed to disavow it, said that doesn't apply.
    And then just days after the meeting at Sharm el-Sheikh, 
and after the phone call between President Biden and Prime 
Minister Netanyahu, the Knesset voted to pass a law to lift the 
ban on reentering four settlements, including Homesh, that 
Israel had committed to evacuate 20 years ago.
    State Department Spokesperson Patel, said the move was, and 
I quote, ``Inconsistent with Israel's recent commitments to 
deescalating Israeli-Palestinian tensions,'' and said, ``It was 
a clear contradiction of undertakings the Israeli government 
made to the United States.''
    I am assuming that you also support and endorse those 
comments made by the State Department spokesperson?
    Secretary Blinken. Senator, I do, but it is also based on 
the--what we hear. And I have heard directly from Israeli 
leadership, as well as the Palestinian Authority, about the 
desire for both sides to see the violence that has reached 
record levels in recent months, deescalate, and to try to get a 
period of calm. And that is clearly in the interest of both 
sides, and it is an interest that at least Prime Minister 
Netanyahu has expressed directly to me.
    And there are a number of things that go with that, you 
decided if we see----
    Senator Van Hollen. No. Mr. Secretary----
    Secretary Blinken [continued]: If we see steps inconsistent 
with that, I think it does contradict what we believe both 
Israelis and the Palestinian Authority are seeking to do, and 
what they have said to us, is in their own self-interest.
    Senator Van Hollen. No, I appreciate that. Obviously we 
need to see compliance on both sides, the Palestinian Authority 
and the Government of Israel. But this was a very official act 
by the Knesset, just days after the phone call between Prime 
Minister Netanyahu and President Biden. So I am pleased to see 
you support, endorse the statement by the State Department 
spokesperson.
    But it seems to me that we look very weak when we 
continually make statements without any kind of consequence, so 
I guess my final question to you is: What are we prepared to 
do? What is the Biden administration prepared to do if you see 
continuing violations, by either side, of this agreement?
    Secretary Blinken. Look, I don't want to speculate or get 
into a hypothetical about where this may go and what we would 
do. I can say that both the Israeli Government and the 
Palestinian Authority want us to be involved and engaged in 
helping, and supporting, and working with them to try to get to 
this period of calm. At some point if either or both sides are 
not doing what we believe is necessary to get there, it will be 
hard or may be futile for us to do that. So we have to look 
very carefully at that.
    But I also think that it is important for everyone to try 
to double down on the steps necessary to try to get there, 
because it is profoundly not in the interests of Israel, our 
close ally and partner, or for that matter the Palestinian 
Authority, to see this cycle, cycle up and not down.
    Senator Van Hollen. Mr. Secretary, I appreciate the 
efforts. And the United States has been involved in trying to 
broker these agreements, I guess my question, and I will just 
leave it with your last answer is that, you know: What are we 
prepared to do when we see violations of those commitments?
    Thank you Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Moran.
    Senator Moran. Chairman, thank you.
    Mr. Secretary, pleased to be with you this morning.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Moran. Last year in this setting I asked you about 
the CPTPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Agreement.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Moran. Your response to me touted the Indo-Pacific 
Economic Forum. I would highlight for you that just in the last 
6 months the Australian Foreign Minister, Singapore's Defense 
Minister, Japan's Foreign Minister have noted, I think with the 
objection our absence, from that agreement.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Moran. What is it that keeps us from a willingness 
to engage? You can shift me back to the Indo-Pacific Economic 
Forum; but why is it that this is not a good idea? The TPP is 
not a good idea for us to engage in?
    I say this, I mean, perhaps from an economic, you know, 
point of view, but from a relationship. I meant to say this at 
the very beginning: I am as concerned about our Nation as I 
have ever been. Those are usually throwaway lines from 
something we say throughout our careers and lives, but it is 
genuine with me. The circumstances we now face suggest to me 
that we need a lot more friends and allies, and our trading 
relationship, our economic support, those relationships matter.
    I walked as Senator Rubio and you were conversing, and it 
seems to me that our foreign policy needs to be different in 
today's world than it was just even a few years ago.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Moran. And this would be one that I think would be 
important from a relationship, from a national security point 
of view, as much as it is from an economic point of view.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. So Senator, a couple of things on 
that: First, our focus, in the immediate, is on building up and 
building out the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, known as 
IPEF. That does include, among other things, some trade 
facilitation measures, it has a focus, for example, on digital 
trade which is so critical to the 21st Century economies. It is 
something that the partners in that endeavor are very focused 
on and----
    Senator Moran. Why does that exclude TPP?
    Secretary Blinken. It doesn't exclude it. I am saying, in 
the in the first instance this is where our focus is, supply 
chain diversification and resiliency. That is a big part of 
IPEF, building out clean economy infrastructures, that is a big 
focus, and then, as well, making sure that we are combating, 
together, corruption that still undermines the systems that we 
are trying to bring together.
    I was there when TPP was negotiated in the--during the 
Obama administration, I was engaged in that. And I think that 
in that moment it was a very good endeavor, and one that I 
think, both economically and strategically, had real benefits. 
I think as it now stands, the world has moved on, and I think 
we have to focus, in the first instance, on what we can do, and 
what we can build out, and generate support for. Let us see 
where we get to----
    Senator Moran. Generate support for.
    Secretary Blinken. Here.
    Senator Moran. Within the United States.
    Secretary Blinken. Within the United States, as well as, of 
course, among our allies and partners. I would note, of course, 
that even as we are working on the Indo-Pacific Economic 
Framework, we have been building and strengthening new 
partnerships in the Indo-Pacific to include the Quad. I just 
came from a meeting with Japan, with Australia, and with India. 
That is a very effective vehicle, including on--increasingly on 
economic matters. We, of course, more strategically, have 
AUKUS.
    The President, as you know, just came from a meeting with 
U.K. and Australia on that, and we have deepened and 
strengthened our engagement with ASEAN, including economically, 
so all of those pieces fit together.
    Senator Moran. Mr. Secretary, I just would say from my 
point of view, when you say, ``We have moved on'', we should 
not have moved on. And we should reengage. These things are not 
mutually exclusive, and what you described as occurring are, in 
my view good things, but it still leaves out an important 
component.
    I joined a number of my colleagues here. I am a co-chair of 
the Senate Hunger Caucus.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Moran. Afghanistan, massive, massive humanitarian 
crisis, 20 million people facing food insecurity. The Taliban 
recently eliminated the ability for women to work in NGO 
organizations in food delivery. What steps are you thinking 
between you and Samantha Power, and others that can be done, in 
regard to Afghanistan and the world food crisis?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. Senator, you are right to point to 
this, this huge challenge. We have been, even since the 
withdrawal from Afghanistan, and ending the war, the largest 
single humanitarian contributor to Afghanistan, particularly 
when it comes to the fundamentals of the basics, like food, we 
have been working, relatively effectively, through 
international partners, implementers, the United Nations, NGOs 
that were getting food where it was needed, and getting other 
basic humanitarian support.
    I think there was a real concern in the first year about 
the possibility of Afghanistan as challenged, deeply challenged 
as it was, falling even further off the edge, that that didn't 
happen in large part, because we were able to send the 
assistance. The problem that we face now is exactly what you 
pointed to, the edicts promulgated by the Taliban, preventing 
women from participating in the delivery of assistance. That 
violates a fundamental principle that we do not want to in any 
way ratify.
    But what is happening, as a practical matter is, that in 
many parts of Afghanistan that edict is not being implemented, 
which means that where it is not being implemented we are able 
to continue to have these groups provide--support them, 
providing assistance, because women are still allowed to 
participate in its distribution.
    So that is what is going on right now. But look, I agree 
with you, the Taliban is taking steps that are digging an even 
deeper hole for the people of Afghanistan.
    Senator Moran. This evening, a number of us will say 
goodbye to Ambassador Beasley.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Moran. And say hello, and welcome to Ambassador 
McCain.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Moran. I would use this opportunity to express my 
gratitude for the leadership of Ambassador Beasley and----
    Secretary Blinken. He has been remarkable.
    Senator Moran. He has been remarkable. And wish every best 
wish for Ambassador McCain.
    I have 38 seconds, Mr. Secretary. Last month I sent a 
letter, along with a number of my colleagues, to Assistant 
Secretary Bitter, Consular Affairs.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Moran. What needs to be done to improve the 
processing of visas, that is the nature of our inquiry, it can 
take over 400 days for a student to get an interview for an 
appointment. These are, certainly, strategic in relationship, 
they are family and humanitarian. Our office I would guess, 
like most of my colleagues, has become a passport and visa 
office. We are a part of the, apparently, the State Department, 
with just hundreds.
    I see a report every week of what we call ``casework'', 
lots of many significant things, visas and passports occupy a 
significant portion of our staff's time. We are willing and 
happy to do it. But something needs to be change at the State 
Department and Consular Affairs.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. I very much appreciate that. And 
this is something that, Senator, we are, and I am absolutely 
seized with. As you know, we have had to build back from COVID, 
the system for doing the visas, as well, by the way here doing 
passports, is very labor intensive, a lot of that labor, both 
in terms of contractors and State Department personnel went 
away during COVID. We have had to build back and that has not 
been without challenge. And we are very focused on dealing with 
the wait times that people are experiencing in countries around 
the world.
    It affects, primarily, right now, first-time visitor 
applicants, processing times for categories that have a 
particular impact on the U.S. economy, students, temporary 
workers, maritime crew renewals, they are actually where they 
were before the pandemic, or actually better.
    For visitor visas, the median, global interview appointment 
wait time is now under 2 months. That is the median. I don't 
want to say that there are not places of importance where it is 
longer, but the median time is under 2 months. That is half of 
what it was in--a year ago, in 2022. Most places, the wait 
times are actually much lower than that, as a practical matter.
    We have 58 million foreign nationals who actually hold a 
valid multi-entry visitor visa, so they don't, of course, need 
to keep reapplying. And they can visit whenever. And in fact, 
most international visitors to the United States come to the 
United States without a visa, because they are either Canadian, 
or they are part of the Visa Waiver Program.
    Again, that doesn't answer the problem for those who 
require visas. What we are seeing, I think the first 5 months 
of this fiscal year, fiscal year 2023, we have had a huge surge 
again in non-immigrant visas, we increased those by 18 percent 
over the same period in 2019, before the pandemic.
    Many countries, like Mexico, like Brazil, we actually 
issued more tourist visas in fiscal year 2022 than we did in 
fiscal year 2019. India, which I know has been a particular 
concern to a lot of people, the wait time for first-time 
visitor visa interviews, dropped 60 percent since January of 
this year, just in the last few months. And we have issued 60 
percent more non-immigrant visas this fiscal year, to date, 
than the same period, again, going back to 2019.
    It is a long way of saying: If you look at it 
comprehensively, there is significant progress and improvement. 
But there are clearly places where we need to do more to surge 
some of our assets. And I think also what happens is, you know, 
anecdotally, these are real human problems, we all hear about 
them, we get seized with them. We want to work with you to 
continue to strengthen this, and improve our----
    Senator Moran. In that regard, would you thank your 
personnel at Consular Affairs? They have been helpful and 
appreciative of the circumstances that we----
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Moran [continuing]. And the people we care about 
are in.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Moran. Thank you.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Moran. We agree on an 
awful lot of trade policy issues.
    Senator Schatz.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am thrilled to 
be on this committee.
    Mr. Secretary, thank you for your service, and thank you 
for being here today. First question is: What is your level of 
confidence that Israel is in compliance with the Leahy Law?
    Secretary Blinken. To the best of my knowledge, they are. 
And certainly it is something that we take very, very seriously 
everywhere around the world. And when we do the necessary 
vetting for foreign military sales, or others, one of the key 
things we look at is Leahy Law compliance. So to the best of my 
knowledge, they are.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you. I see that you have a new 
program, Strengthening Forest Conservation and Land Management 
Initiative, which is great. You know I care very deeply about--
--
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Schatz [continuing]. International deforestation, 
especially commodity-driven deforestation. A kind of technical 
question: It is not obvious to me why you are dividing 
implementation between State and USAID. So can you describe the 
theory of the case here?
    Secretary Blinken. I am actually happy to come back to you 
on that. And make sure that I give you a fully, informed 
answer. I can say, generally, two things: one, we are deeply 
committed to this, and appreciate the leadership that you have 
shown on it.
    Just by way of example, President Lula, as you know, was in 
Washington just recently to meet with President Biden. One of 
the things we focused on, of course, was dealing with the 
deforestation of the Amazon, and indeed hopefully dealing with 
the reforestation as necessary. We are committed to that. We 
would like to actually contribute to the Amazon Fund, something 
we will probably need to work with Congress on.
    But that as to the allocation of resources between State 
and USAID, you know, generally speaking, we are focused on, and 
by ``we'', I mean the State Department, are focused on the 
policy and diplomatic aspects of working things, USAID tends to 
implement, and it may be that the Budget Division reflects 
that. But I need to give you an informed answer. So let me come 
back to you.
    Senator Schatz. Sure. Just on Lula, I think, obviously, 
there are incredible opportunities here, but it seems to me 
that we are not going to say of the world's forest, just sort 
of hoping for a bunch of Lulas to get elected across the 
planet. And so I think we do need to come up with an economic 
model. Lula is a willing, enthusiastic participant, but we have 
to make it worth it to their country.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. So that other countries that are trying to 
figure out where to move, economically, that they get--that 
they can see a pathway that works for them. So I agree with you 
about the Deforestation Fund, and whatever we can do to be 
supportive there, I will try to help.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Schatz. I welcome the budget's focus on democracy 
and human rights, and particularly robust funding for promoting 
press freedom. There is no dedicated envoy or office for press 
freedom, so how do you ensure that press freedom stays high on 
that list of priorities, as your offices across the planet have 
so many things to contend with, and yet this seems to me need 
to be part of the slide towards authoritarianism across the 
planet.
    Secretary Blinken. It really is front and center on the 
agenda for a number of offices at the Department, and by the 
way, for me, since this is something I have spent some time on, 
including making sure that I was speaking up and speaking out 
on World Press Freedom Day. But also making sure that 
programmatically, we are putting in place the resources, the 
tools to defend press freedom, and that is exactly what we have 
done over the last couple of years.
    It was a key feature, and we will--by the way, next week we 
will begin the key feature of the Summit for Democracy. It is 
one of the critical pillars in that. We put in place, for 
example, funds to help the press that is being assaulted with 
lawfare in various places, be able to have the funds to defend 
themselves. We put in place resources to help protect 
journalists who are actually under physical threat.
    Senior officials in my Department, particularly in the 
Bureau of Democracy and Labor are--this is right front and 
center on their agendas. So I can tell you that it is something 
that I am personally focused on, and the critical Bureaus in 
our Department, are focused on.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you. Let us move to the Pacific. I am 
glad to see a larger request from the administration for 
foreign assistance for Pacific Island countries for fiscal year 
2023, but it is still short of the enacted level. And so could 
you speak to that, the dollar amount, but also I want to give 
you a chance to talk about what we are doing in the Pacific 
Island region. And I want to coach you a little bit.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Schatz. Not that you need coaching. But I want to 
remind us that it is difficult to compete with graft, right?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. And so what we have to offer are, as you 
say, values, right, and relationships. And as I have talked to 
Pacific Island leaders, sure, they need resources, and 
especially in a climate-change context, lots of these countries 
are really in need of our direct material assistance. But they 
also want to be respected as sovereigns.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Schatz. And so I would like you to talk through 
how, attitudinally, we are shifting, and not just throwing 
another, say, $80 million at the problem, and then trying to 
park all of our military hardware wherever it is convenient on 
a map. These have to be a sovereign-to-sovereign relationship. 
I would like you to talk to that.
    Secretary Blinken. So we have, we fundamentally elevated 
the Pacific Island countries in our foreign policy and in our 
diplomacy, and that really culminated with what was really, I 
think, a historic Summit Meeting between President Biden and 
the Leaders of the Pacific Island nations. It is something that 
I took part in, and it really was an extraordinary moment, 
because I think it said to them, and it said to their people, 
that the United States is engaged in a different way.
    And now that needs to manifest itself in concrete, 
practical ways. Our diplomatic presence, as you know, we opened 
in the Solomon Islands, we are looking at establishing two to 
three other embassies, or outposts in the Pacific Islands where 
we have been absent for the last years. That is moving forward. 
It is also reflected in our budget.
    Our economic engagement, particularly in finding and 
catalyzing resources to deal with challenges that are affecting 
the lives of Pacific Islanders, that is front and center. As 
you know, it is an interesting challenge because, in many 
cases, each individual island nation is small, and so making a 
market can be complicated, but particularly as they are pooled 
together, and we are able to pool some resources, we are doing 
that.
    I think on climate we have an absolute responsibility, and 
we are acting on it, to try to provide the technical 
assistance, the technology and, yes, the resources to deal with 
this, particularly for countries that, literally, risk not 
existing because of climate change. And of course, programs 
that we have that are reflected in the budget: for education, 
for governance, for building institutions, all of those were 
there. I am happy to work with you, and work with your team to 
make sure that we are properly resourced to do that, but this 
really is front and center in our thinking.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you. Just one final thought on what 
is happening with climate. I think there are some cases, 
Kiribati is a good example where they really might vanish.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. But I think the less precipitous, but just 
as bad scenario, is saltwater inundation of the freshwater 
systems, of the irrigation systems, and so you can't drink 
water, you can't use water to farm.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. And then there is no economy at all.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. And none of these people have any place to 
go. So although I, you know, I love what DFC is doing, and I 
love the opportunities to kind of envision economic growth. But 
the truth is, some of these people need immediate assistance 
because they can't drink the salt water, and their runways are 
flooding. And so I think we need to race to their aid without 
precondition.
    Secretary Blinken. Appreciate that.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you.
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Mr. Secretary.
    Secretary Blinken. Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. If you have 10 more minutes, rather than 
submitting a whole bunch of questions for the record, I am 
going to quickly run through five topics.
    Secretary Blinken. Sure, of course.
    Senator Coons. We have a noon vote, to the best of my 
knowledge no other Member of the Committee is coming back. None 
of these will surprise you, but I thought it was worth the time 
since we have each other here.
    Secretary Blinken. Sure.
    Senator Coons. Let me pick up from the point that Senator 
Schatz was just making. The Development Finance Corporation I 
think is a big step forward. You are the Chairman of the Board. 
I would love to hear--so I briefly want to talk about DFC, GFA, 
Conservation Foundation, PEPFAR, Mexico.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Coons. And I can start with the first two and get 
them disposed of quickly.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Coons. The 20th anniversary of PEPFAR is, indeed, 
worth celebrating. I am glad that you have prioritized it in 
your opening statement. We have some real work to do here to 
make sure that it remains authorized and robustly funded, and I 
look forward to working closely with you on that.
    I just spent the weekend in Mexico with a broad bipartisan 
group of Senators and House Members. We have an outstanding 
Ambassador. We have got 4 hours of the President's time, 
President Lopez Obrador and his entire Cabinet. And for the 
first 2 hours he simply listened, as members of his Cabinet 
made presentations, and members of our delegation engaged.
    I believe there is much more good news about our 
partnership, and its potential, in terms of border crossings 
and security, fentanyl interdiction, economic development, and 
some of the ways that our economies, and our values, and 
priorities align, than one could easily discern from the cable 
coverage of this. But there are some real irritants in the 
relationship.
    Secretary Blinken. Senator, can I just say very quickly, I 
very much agree with that. And we really have seen, in many 
places the--our Mexican partners step up to, including dealing 
with drug trafficking, dealing with the transnational criminal 
enterprises. But the problem is huge, they are resource 
deficient, and so I think we have to continue to work with 
them. We have restored the security dialogue that would have 
been held in advance, we are working very actively under that. 
We have a ``Bicentennial Framework'', as we called it.
    Senator Coons. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. To really move out on concrete 
cooperation. And again, we have seen seizures go up, we have 
seen the active, very active work to disband criminal 
enterprises, we have seen a very significant increase in 
Mexican law enforcement that has arrest authority, by the 
creation of a National Guard. That has been important.
    And of course, on migration, they have been a critical 
partner, it doesn't answer the full problem, but absent that 
partnership, the challenge would be even greater. So sorry to 
interrupt but I think it is important, you are right, to 
underscore the fact that they are a vital partner. Never mind 
the fact that, you know, one of our two largest trading 
partners in the world.
    Senator Coons. A presentation at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs made it very clear that the recent initiative taken by 
the Biden administration to require an application, a legal 
process crossing at that border point, brought down 
dramatically entrants from four different countries.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. That is right.
    Senator Coons. I am eager to work with you, if I possibly 
can, to support finding a path forward as we anticipate the end 
of Title 42, in the middle of May.
    So DFC, you are the Chairman of the Board.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Coons. How successful do you think we have been, 
using this newly expanded tool? It is built on the base of OPIC 
but it has got new equity authorities, it can do a whole range 
of things that we couldn't do before. I think this is a 
critical opportunity to crowd in private sector capital 
investment, and de-risk it. Where are we making a difference? 
Where are we not? And what do you think we need to fix to make 
it really reach its potential?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. So I fully, I fully share your view 
that the DFC is a critical tool, one that I think we are using, 
increasingly, effectively, and it goes to exactly the points 
that you are making. For the United States the comparative 
advantage we have, if we do it right, is mobilizing--catalyzing 
the private sector. We obviously are not going to match China, 
for example, dollar for dollar, coming from our taxpayers. And 
the DFC is a vital tool in doing that.
    I do think that there are a couple of critical additions 
that we could make to the DFC that would make it even more 
effective, and one, maybe the most important one from my 
perspective, and our perspective, is lifting the constraints 
that require counting equity like a grant.
    Senator Coons. Yes.
    Secretary Blinken. Basically what is most in demand, which 
are equity investments from the DFC, end up being what costs 
the most. And I believe if we do that we will see its 
effectiveness in leveraging more private sector investment go 
up significantly.
    Senator Coons. Well, I look forward to working closely with 
you on that, your budget proposes a $2 billion mandatory to the 
DFC.
    Secretary Blinken. That is right.
    Senator Coons. Well welcome, well engaging, that does not 
address the most important issue, which you are absolutely 
right, is a legal fix----
    Secretary Blinken. That is right.
    Senator Coons [continuing]. To a scoring issue that is 
restraining this from being--if you come to the party and 
everybody else has got equity investments, and you have only 
got debt, you are the last person, and in a game of musical 
chairs, that often means we don't get to pick our partners, we 
don't get to drive and scope the project, we don't get to 
deliver on the values that are at the core of transparency, and 
labor, and environment that we would like to see.
    So I hope that in this year, in this authorizing process, 
in the Foreign Relations Committee, where you may well be this 
afternoon, this issue might also be discussed.
    Global Fragility Act, something Senator Graham and I 
crafted based on positive experiences with Colombia. It is an 
important tool, but the whole goal here was to, with State at 
the lead, have State, USAID, and DOD jointly plan. Having 
recently visited Niger, as I know you did as well, likely 
heading back to Coastal West Africa, there are places where we 
need to show this kind of prioritization.
    I think it is off to a slow start, and I am concerned about 
the lack of active senior engagement from DOD. I want to make 
sure this isn't just viewed as another foreign assistance 
program, but instead is a framework that prioritizes State's 
leadership. What are you doing to get this off the ground 
right? How can I help?
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. I agree with you. This is a 
critical framework for us, and I think it has the very strong 
merit in making sure that we have a holistic, comprehensive, 
whole-of-government approach to dealing with fragility, because 
we know that just focusing on any one piece of this, security, 
foreign assistance, you take it, is not enough, doesn't answer 
the mail. And that is why I think this is a--was a very welcome 
thing.
    Yes, we have been working intensely on this. And what I can 
tell you today is that I think very, very imminently 
forthcoming, are the actual approved country plans by the 
President. So I think that will be an important step forward. 
And as I said, I think that is imminent.
    Senator Coons. Perhaps we will have another conversation as 
soon as those are out about how to better engage DOD at a 
senior enough level that it moves the needle. Thank you. The 
last thing--I am sorry, I have one more.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes, please.
    Senator Coons. We have worked hard together to provide 
robust assistance to Ukraine, in fact I think this has been 
President Biden's best chapter, in a very long career public 
service, really marshaling the resources of the world to 
deliver from sanctions, to humanitarian, to economic, to 
military assistance as Ukraine continues to fight bravely.
    Are we doing enough to ensure proper oversight of our 
assistance, and to avoid an unforced error, a challenge to 
sustaining our assistance, through a lack of accountability and 
transparency?
    Secretary Blinken. So again, I couldn't agree with you 
more. This is something we are intensely focused on, precisely 
because we have an obligation to make sure that the taxpayers' 
money is being used the way it was intended to be used. And 
also we certainly don't want to give those who may not want to 
sustain the support, reason to move us in that direction.
    So we have been intensely focused on this. I have got on 
the ground, right now, in our Embassy in Kiev, 45 people whose 
responsibility it is to oversee the funds that we are providing 
to the Government of Ukraine. That is just on the State 
Department side. DOD has its own people on the ground including 
at our Embassy, to make sure that the military equipment that 
we are providing, is being used in the right way. The system 
that is in place is actually a very good one. Basically when it 
comes to direct budget support goes through--most of it goes 
through the World Bank. The World Bank has a system where the 
money is dispersed to reimburse, based on receipts and approved 
expenditures----
    Senator Coons. Right.
    Secretary Blinken [continuing]. The money. The Office of 
the Inspector General did its first report on this, that just 
came out a few weeks ago, and it found--and I don't want to 
quote it directly, but the bottom line finding was that there 
is--we got very good marks on the oversight, and making sure 
that the money is being spent well, and that the processes are 
in place to ensure that.
    At the same time, there is also third-party validation, 
Deloitte is working within the Ministry of Finance in Ukraine, 
to make sure that it has the systems in place, to make sure 
that the money is being well used.
    And the final thing I will say is this: We have seen 
President Zelenskyy go at challenges of corruption, or misuse 
of funds in the government with a sledgehammer, removing very 
senior officials across multiple ministries who, allegedly, 
were involved in either corruption, or improper oversight of 
funds. So I take that as a very good sign, that not only are we 
seized with it, but the Government of Ukraine is too.
    Senator Coons. You talked with two different members about 
a reforestation in Brazil and the Amazon.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Coons. And the importance of addressing climate in 
a meaningful way. One of the areas I think we could come 
together is around reforestation and conservation.
    Secretary Blinken. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Coons. Improving the management of wild and open 
spaces that are not yet overrun by people and poachers, 
particularly in South America and in Africa. A group of us, led 
by Senator Graham and me, but four others, introduced the U.S. 
Foundation for International Conservation Act. It would, 
principally, draw in philanthropic and private individual 
donations, set up a board that would have U.S. Government 
experts in the field, and donors, prioritizing these funds for 
the long-term preservation of spaces that are genuinely at 
risk.
    Are you aware of it? Is it something you might support? Is 
it something we could work on together?
    Secretary Blinken. I need to look at this very carefully. 
As you have described it certainly sounds like something that 
we would want to support. Let me look at the details and come 
back to you.
    Senator Coons. Okay.
    Secretary Blinken. But I think there is a lot of merit to 
that, particularly when it comes to making sure we are engaged 
now in places that are still open to being secured and 
preserved. So I would welcome working on that.
    Senator Coons. You just released the Department's Annual 
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Coons. Closing question: Where have we made the 
most progress? What have we left undone? What should we do in 
the next 2 years to advance human rights?
    Secretary Blinken. So you know, if you look at the report I 
think it is--let me say diplomatically--a mixed picture. We 
continue to see democratic backsliding, and backsliding on 
human rights in a number of countries, something that we call 
out very clearly in the report. And you know, one of the things 
that is so important about the report is we apply the same 
lens, the same prism, to friends, to competitors, to 
adversaries across the board; and of course we acknowledge our 
own challenges in that.
    At the same time, I think the report points out that in a 
number of places we have seen genuine progress, important 
progress. I think there are a number of countries, for example, 
where looking at some marginalized groups that have been 
particularly victimized, like the LGBTQI+ community, there are 
some countries where we have actually seen real progress in 
upholding or protecting their rights. Just as there are other 
places where that continues to backslide in a significant way.
    So it is a mixed--I think it is a very mixed report, but 
what is important about it is, it continues to put a spotlight 
on these challenges, with the imprimatur of the United States 
Government on it. I think it is a way of--strongly encouraging, 
countries to take steps that they need to take to improve the 
human rights picture.
    It is one of the reasons, by the way, that every year when 
we do this, I think it is incumbent upon me to go and present 
the report. I do that in front of our media in the State 
Department Briefing Room, just to make sure that people 
understand that this really comes from the Secretary of State 
on behalf of the President of the United States. And it is 
something that we attach tremendous importance to.
    Senator Coons. Thank you. Mr. Secretary, thank you for your 
leadership. Thank you for two hours of high energy, and 
engaging testimony. I know you have another session in front of 
our authorizing committee, the Foreign Relations Committee 
later today. I think most importantly you make a compelling 
case for the urgent national security-based need to invest more 
robustly in our diplomacy and development.
    So I look forward to working with you, together, to see 
what we can move forward and get passed this year. I will just 
say to the colleagues who have joined, we had, I think, a dozen 
senators participate at different points. This was a good and 
constructive hearing.
    Senator Hagerty had information related to the Vulcan case.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes.
    Senator Coons. The seizure of a port that he would like 
added to the record. So ordered. And the hearing record will 
remain open for written questions until 5:00 p.m., Wednesday, 
March 29.

                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but 
were submitted to the agencies for response subsequent to the 
hearing:]
            Questions Submitted to Secretary Antony Blinken
             Questions Submitted by Senator Jeanne Shaheen
    Question. The Black Sea is clearly of geostrategic importance to 
Putin, but the United States and the broader transatlantic community--
including NATO--have failed to successfully push back on Putin's 
expansionist agenda toward the Black Sea. Will the relevant State 
Department officials make themselves available to testify at the Europe 
Subcommittee to discuss the strategy once it is issued to Congress?

    Answer. Yes, I will ensure the relevant officials are available to 
testify on our U.S. Black Sea strategy once it is submitted to 
Congress. The United States has an enduring interest in the Black Sea 
region and we are working on a strategy that will strengthen our 
political, security, economic, and energy cooperation with the region 
and promote democratic resilience.

    Question. Sometimes the loudest and most extreme voices make 
national headlines, overshadowing the less news-worthy fact that the 
majority of this Congress remains firmly in support of Ukraine's war 
against Russia's aggression. How is the Biden administration supporting 
the Ukrainian government's efforts to focus on these reform efforts for 
successful membership into the European Union while engaged in a full-
on war with Russia?

    Answer. We welcome Ukraine's EU candidacy and support the Ukrainian 
government's efforts to advance necessary institution-building in line 
with Ukraine's European path. In our engagements with Ukraine's 
government, we have consistently emphasized the importance of 
inclusive, transparent, and accountable democratic institutions. We are 
also providing technical assistance to increase judicial independence, 
foster greater adherence to the rule of law, and counter systemic 
corruption.

    Question. We are all closely watching the implications of President 
Xi's visit to Moscow recently. I know that you met with your Chinese 
counterpart in Munich last month. What outcomes of the Xi-Putin summit 
hold the greatest national security implications for the United States?

    Answer. President Xi's visit to Moscow was further evidence that 
the PRC continues to align with Russia as Moscow wages its brutal war 
against Ukraine. At the Munich Security Conference, I made clear there 
would be real consequences in our relationship if the PRC were to 
provide Russia lethal assistance or systematic assistance evading 
sanctions. We have already sanctioned the PRC firm Spacety for 
providing satellite imagery to Wagner forces in Ukraine, and we 
continue to monitor this space very closely.

    Question. To what extent will Xi leverage China's influence on 
Russia to encourage Ukraine to pursue a peace deal?

    Answer. The United States welcomes any initiative that advances a 
just and durable peace in Ukraine, no matter the author. The PRC issued 
a 12-point position paper on Russia's war in Ukraine, which includes an 
essential point: respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity 
of all countries. We call on President Xi to advocate for this key 
point, which necessarily includes the withdrawal of Russia's forces 
from Ukraine's sovereign territory, consistent with the UN Charter.

    Question. I appreciate that, very early in its tenure, the Biden 
administration rescinded the ``global gag rule'' of the Trump 
administration, which prohibits foreign NGOs from using separate, non-
U.S. funds to provide legal abortion services. But simply rescinding 
the dangerous policy is not enough. How are you working with USAID 
administrator Samantha Power to ensure that the administration's policy 
is clear to all partners, including other countries, multinational and 
nongovernmental organizations as well as the implementing organizations 
on the ground that provided much needed services to women?

    Answer. The Department of State continues to coordinate closely 
with USAID to ensure full implementation of the Presidential Memorandum 
on Protecting Women at Home and Abroad. Our collaboration to 
demonstrate the administration's commitment to sexual and reproductive 
health and rights, including in relation to policy clarification, 
extends to our partnerships with various international organizations 
and U.S. Missions around the world.

    Question. Two years ago, President Biden nominated Geeta Rao Gupta 
to be Ambassador At Large for Global Women's Issues. Given the 
rollbacks on gender equality around the world, including here at home, 
how can the United States continue to be a human rights leader in this 
area?

    Answer. Over the past 2 years, the Department has released the 
first-ever strategy on women's economic security, updated its global 
gender-based violence strategy, and continues to implement the Women, 
Peace, and Security agenda. We demonstrate U.S. leadership through 
multilateral engagement in the UN Commission on the Status of Women, 
targeted programs such as the SHE WINS Rapid Response Fund, and public 
diplomacy through the International Women of Courage Awards. Senate-
confirmed leadership is important to the continued success of these 
initiatives.

    Question. Within the State Department, how do you ensure that 
gender issues are mainstreamed across every sector of the State 
Department?

    Answer. The Department's Action Plan for the U.S. National Strategy 
on Gender Equity and Equality identified entry points for better 
integrating the perspectives of women and girls in institutional 
policies and practices. This work is ongoing as the Department and 
USAID strive to meet the President's budget request of more than $3 
billion for foreign assistance related to gender equality. The 
Department regularly convenes foreign assistance Community of Practice 
sessions and has strengthened our gender equality training and 
analytical tools to build the capacity of Department personnel.

    Question. The Women, Peace and Security Act makes it a U.S. 
priority to protect and support women's roles in peace negotiations and 
conflict resolution around the world and within the U.S. government. 
The Office of Global Women's Issues does the important work of 
promoting WPS in U.S. policy around the world, but who in your 
department is tasked with ensuring that the tenets of WPS are upheld 
within the Department of State?

    Answer. The Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues (S/GWI) 
is the senior official for Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) 
coordination; and works closely with Department leadership to oversee 
integration of WPS in U.S. foreign policy and assistance. S/GWI 
established and regularly convenes the Department-wide WPS Steering 
Committee to exchange information on progress, challenges, and lessons 
learned. The U.S. is co-chairing the UN Women WPS Focal Points Network 
for the first time in 2023; the S/GWI Ambassador-at-Large serves as the 
U.S. government Focal Point.

    Question. What role does the Office of Diversity and Inclusion play 
in ensuring that women at the Department of State have access to the 
resources and opportunities needed?

    Answer. The Department's Office of Diversity and Inclusion promotes 
the principles of accountability and transparency as it works to 
advance issues of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility for 
all Department employees, including women. The Office is currently 
working with key stakeholders to develop a policy to facilitate the use 
of lactation devices within controlled access areas, an issue of 
particular interest to working mothers. Ambassador Abercrombie-
Winstanley would be happy to discuss with you.

    Question. Today, both Sweden and Finland are on the cusp of NATO 
membership, but two countries hold up their membership ambitions; 
Hungary and Tuerkiye. Ahead of the Vilnius Summit, what deliverables 
does this administration hope to achieve?

    Answer. The administration continues to urge Hungary and Turkiye to 
ratify Finland's and Sweden's accession to NATO at the earliest 
possible opportunity before the 2023 NATO Summit in Vilnius. Finland's 
and Sweden's accession will strengthen NATO's collective defense. The 
administration also supports an updated defense investment pledge; 
enhanced support for Ukraine; implementation of NATO's updated plans 
for collective defense; and enhancing NATO's partnerships including 
with the Asia Pacific as Vilnius deliverables.

    Question. I remain committed to working with the administration to 
ensure that peace is upheld in Bosnia; supporting their democratic 
reform agenda is an integral component in bringing them closer to EU 
and NATO membership. To what extent to you envision the funds requested 
by the administration for the Western Balkans will include new 
initiatives to enhance the cyber defenses of this region?

    Answer. The Biden administration is actively working to ensure our 
alliances reflect and respond to the world we face. As part of the 
fourth Ukraine supplemental appropriation from Congress, we plan to 
allocate $50 million in cybersecurity support to the Western Balkans. 
This includes a recent $25 million pledge to Albania, with an 
additional $25 million yet to be allocated. We recognize the importance 
of cybersecurity to the stability of the region and NATO's collective 
security and will leverage our technical assistance and expertise to 
strengthen the cyber capabilities across the Western Balkans.

    Question. Lukashenka continues a brutal crackdown on the Belarusian 
people; a recent news article reported that Lukashenka is now targeting 
therapists to snitch on ``pro-Ukraine'' patients to suppress partisan 
activity. What additional measures are under consideration to prevent 
Lukashenka's further oppression of the Belarusian people?

    Answer. Since the fraudulent 2020 election, we have levied 
sanctions and visa bans against the Lukashenka regime for its brutal 
crackdown against the pro-democracy movement, flagrant human rights 
abuses, and facilitation of Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. As 
these acts persist, we continue to examine new targets, and to 
coordinate with our partners and allies, to impose additional costs on 
the regime for its repression of the people of Belarus and its ongoing 
support for Russia's unprovoked and illegal war against Ukraine.

    Question. In last year's NDAA, the HAVANA Act was expanded to 
ensure that all relevant agencies received the authority to designate 
AHI's to ensure that all affected individuals could receive access to 
this payment. Do you have the funds and resources in place to ensure 
that this legislation is fully implemented and that the victims receive 
treatment?

    Answer. Under the law, I continue to hold the authority to 
designate as ``other incidents'' reports of anomalous health incidents 
that occurred to individuals under Chief of Mission security 
responsibility. For HAVANA Act payment requests, I have delegated this 
authority to the Under Secretary of Management. The State Department 
has sufficient resources to ensure that the HAVANA Act is fully 
implemented for our employees and their family members, and that they 
receive appropriate treatment.
    The State Department is working with other departments and agencies 
to help them facilitate their rules and processes for reviewing HAVANA 
Act payment requests.

    Question. After widespread protests against the Georgian 
Parliament's consideration of a foreign agent law, it is clear that we 
need to revisit our policy toward Georgia and reinvigorate our approach 
toward the country. Is the State Department considering any measures to 
apply necessary pressure on those responsible for actively working 
against Georgia's Euro-Atlantic ambitions?

    Answer. The United States does not preview designations or 
sanctions in advance. However, the Department of State will use Section 
7031(c) visa restrictions and all other appropriate measures to promote 
accountability when we have sufficient, credible information to do so.

    Question. Will the administration commit to a full review of our 
policy toward Georgia?

    Answer. Our policy toward Georgia remains the same, and we review 
our strategy to achieve our policy on an ongoing basis. We have made 
our concerns about democratic backsliding very clear to the government. 
We remain steadfastly committed to supporting the people of Georgia's 
Euro-Atlantic aspirations. The United States continues to urge Georgia 
to implement the necessary reforms to achieve EU candidate status. We 
firmly support Georgia's NATO aspirations. We continue promoting the 
vital democratic reforms that are essential for EU candidacy. Such 
reforms also are essential to NATO accession, as NATO is a values-based 
political-military alliance.

    Question. I am proud to have both the National Visa Center and the 
National Passport Center in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It is to 
everyone's benefit that both centers operate efficiently, which is why 
I welcome the inclusion in the President's request for additional 
funding to improve consular services. What efforts are being undertaken 
at the NVC to reduce the immigrant visa backlog and better communicate 
to Afghan SIV applicants?

    Answer. The National Visa Center has eliminated all internal 
immigrant visa pre-processing and public inquiry backlogs. NVC is using 
data-driven analyses to help posts adjudicate immigrant visas more 
efficiently and schedule more applicants sooner. NVC is working with 
posts that have large pandemic-driven backlogs to inform backlog 
elimination plans. NVC is also working closely with the Department's 
Afghan Evacuation Coalition to improve communications with Afghan SIV 
applicants about how, when, and where their cases will be scheduled.

    Question. I have worked closely with Democratic and Republican 
administrations to bring home Americans wrongfully detained or taken 
hostage abroad. Instead of terrorist cells, increasingly we are seeing 
foreign governments unjustly detain Americans to use for their own 
malign intentions. Will you commit to working with Congress to conduct 
a review of U.S. hostage and detainee policy to ensure that the U.S. 
government is ready to meet the evolving challenge of ensuring that all 
Americans are brought home safely?

    Answer. I am committed to working closely with Congress on this 
issue, and my team has worked hard to ensure Congress is kept abreast 
of our engagements and initiatives as an equal partner in our foreign 
policy making. There is no higher priority than the safety and security 
of U.S. citizens around the world, including those who may be 
wrongfully detained or held hostage.

    Question. One of my constituents alerted me to a lingering inequity 
affecting some 250 Foreign Service employees that dates back to 2014, 
when the State Department did not pay the compensation traditionally 
awarded to employees who were recommended for promotion but who fell 
below the cutoff. While employees in the same category in 2013, 2015 
and 2016 were later retroactively paid, there is one group who have 
been forgotten. As you can imagine, these employees have not forgotten. 
What is the Department doing to honor the Department's commitment to 
its workforce and ensure these forgotten employees are fairly and 
expeditiously compensated? May I seek your assurances that you will 
direct the Department to use its resources to remedy this outstanding 
payroll issue?

    Answer. The American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) filed four 
``implementation disputes'' against the Department's awarding of 
Meritorious Service Increases (MSIs) to less than 10 percent of the 
eligible employees, alleging that the Department violated the 2013, 
2014, 2015, and 2016 Selection Board Procedural Precepts. The Foreign 
Service Labor Relations Board (FSLRB) held in the 2014 MSI case that 
``the plain meaning of the agreement is that the Agency may award MSIs 
to 10 percent or less of the eligible employees.'' The FSLRB decision 
fully resolved the 2014 MSI case which involved approximately 270 MSIs 
with an estimated risk liability of over $2.5 million.
    However, in the subsequent 2015 and 2016 MSI cases, the FSLRB ruled 
in AFSA's favor in a split decision. That decision, which the 
Department contends was wrongly decided, does not disturb the 
resolution of the 2014 MSI case in the Department's favor. Therefore, 
the Department declines to apply the FSLRB's incorrect interpretation 
of the law to effectively overturn the FSLRB's earlier, correct 
interpretation in the 2014 MSI case.

    Question. At a time of significant global challenges from 
disinformation and pandemics to migration and climate change, and 
amidst rising strategic competition from China and Russia, I believe 
it's more important than ever to expand international people-to-people 
exchanges to develop new partnerships, share American values, and 
increase mutual understanding worldwide. If people-to-people exchanges 
are essential to achieving our near and long-term U.S. foreign policy 
objectives, how does the administration justify decreasing funding for 
core academic, professional, and cultural exchange programs for fiscal 
year 2024?

    Answer. The Department's FY 2024 Request for ECA programs is $783.7 
million, $6.2 million above the fiscal year 2023 Adjusted Enacted 
level. Central to this request is Exchanges Support, which pays for all 
of the bureau's administrative expenses from staff salaries to IT, as 
well as staff travel for program oversight. Increased funding for 
Exchanges Support will help ECA best support the workforce and program 
implementation, including staff monitoring to ensure the safety and 
security of our participants. Strategic alignment of program delivery 
with the necessary administrative support required certain offsets 
reflected in the President's budget.

    Question. How will the Biden administration optimize our 
competitive advantage vis a vis China, Russia, and other countries if 
we continue to underinvest in the State Department's Bureau of 
Educational and Cultural Affairs and these proven soft power programs?

    Answer. With its global reach and proven models for exchanges, ECA 
is well positioned to help ensure that U.S. embassies and consulates 
have the tools necessary to build alliances and maintain U.S. 
leadership. For instance, exchange program funding supports Ukraine 
through cultural heritage protection efforts, counters Russian 
disinformation, and enables the Department to increase Indo-Pacific 
engagement through the expansion of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders 
Initiative and English language programming.

    Question. The costs associated with global mobility and exchange 
have risen steadily over time and more dramatically in recent years. 
Exchange organizations who administer these soft power programs are 
being asked to do so for a greater number of participants, despite flat 
administrative funding, increasing costs and higher required levels of 
effort due to, for instance, a rise in safety and mental health related 
issues. While I'm pleased that the Biden administration has requested 
long overdue funding for internal administrative support, given the 
President's requested decrease in funding for fiscal year 24 regarding 
core exchange programs, is the State Department sufficiently 
considering the needs of its exchange organizations at this challenging 
time?

    Answer. The Department continues to prioritize the importance of 
engagement with foreign publics on behalf of the United States. We 
value the essential contributions of exchange organizations to the 
success of Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) efforts and 
will continue to evaluate the resources needed to deliver on the 
mission these organizations are given. The fiscal year 2024 request 
takes into account the need for appropriate program and staff support, 
understanding that the inflationary impacts on our limited resources 
may mean some reduction in participant numbers. Increases in some areas 
are offset by reductions in others to strategically align program 
delivery with the necessary administrative support.

    Question. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs has made 
it clear that it is committed to maximizing the return on investment 
when it comes to exchange alumni, including by supporting their ongoing 
development as future leaders through targeted programming that 
advances U.S. interests and objectives. Yet, the President's fiscal 
year 2024 budget request recommends a decrease of $700,000 in alumni-
related funding. Does the State Department remain committed to 
strengthening its engagement with and support of exchange alumni?

    Answer. We remain fully committed to continuing and expanding 
engagement of exchange alumni. We have expanded resources for alumni 
seminars on policy priorities such as democracy, the Indo-Pacific 
strategy, and diversity in foreign policy. Alumni engagement is not 
only funded by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) 
Office of Alumni Affairs, but also within each exchange program's 
grant, giving us a range of ways to continue engagement. The funding 
request reflects increased support for the workforce and program 
implementation, including staff monitoring to ensure the safety and 
security of our participants.

    Question. Since the start of the pandemic, technology has become 
increasingly more important in international exchange program 
implementation and is one way to make an exchange experience more 
accessible. Investing in and developing virtual and hybrid programming 
requires a lot of intentionality in order to be a successful supplement 
or complement to traditional in-person exchanges. How will the State 
Department support program implementers in integrating virtual and 
hybrid components to expand participation and reach new audiences?

    Answer. When the pandemic temporarily halted many USG-funded in-
person exchanges, ECA's innovative management of international 
exchanges allowed programs and partner organizations to pivot rapidly 
to virtual and hybrid models, replicating key components of an in-
person exchange. ECA was able to reprogram funds to support these 
partner organizations. As a result, community members acquired critical 
technology and training that enabled them to learn and engage in 
virtual programming. ECA continues to incorporate lessons learned 
during the pandemic and supports virtual engagement that helps reach 
new audiences and enhances the impact of in-person exchange programs.

    Question. The fisacal year 2023 omnibus included report language 
encouraging the Department of State to allocate resources through the 
Migration and Refugee Assistance account to provide safe, inclusive, 
and quality education for refugee and internally displaced children. 
What is the administration's fiscal year 2024 plan to support education 
and flexible learning to maintain continuity across situations of 
crisis?

    Answer. The Department is committed to taking all possible steps to 
ensure access to quality, safe, and inclusive education for forcibly 
displaced and conflict-affected children. We do this through both 
diplomatic engagement and programming. We also remain a steadfast 
supporter of Education Cannot Wait, a global fund for education in 
emergencies and protracted crises. The Department also participates in 
the U.S. Basic Education Working Group, and we look forward to 
contributing to the next iteration of the U.S. Government Strategy for 
International Basic Education.

    Question. The situation in Lebanon is dire. In December, Sens. Bob 
Menendez (D-NJ) and Jim Risch (R-ID) wrote a letter to Secretary of the 
Treasury Janet Yellen and yourself, calling for the use of sanctions 
against Lebanon's financial and political elite for obstructing the 
election of a president and implementation of needed financial reforms. 
Why has the administration yet to announce any additional sanctions 
against corrupt officials in Lebanon?

    Answer. I share your concerns about endemic corruption in Lebanon, 
officials' reluctance to implement reforms, and stalled presidential 
elections. We continue to press Lebanese officials at all levels on 
these priorities. In addition to diplomatic engagement, sanctions can 
be a useful tool to encourage progress and a warning to those 
undermining the rule of law. Our previous designations clearly 
demonstrate our commitment to combatting corruption, and we continue to 
work with the Department of the Treasury to identify impactful targets.

    Question. How is the administration communicating any consequences 
if Lebanese parliamentarians elect a president who is not clean, 
capable and reform minded?

    Answer. The administration continues to stress that Lebanon needs a 
president free of corruption who can unite the country and forge a 
coalition to implement badly needed reforms. In concert with our 
partners in France, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt, we continue to make 
clear that Lebanese politicians blocking progress on the election of 
such a candidate could face negative repercussions--an idea that senior 
U.S. officials continue to underscore with Lebanese leaders at all 
levels, including via our Embassy in Beirut and in meetings with Saudi 
and French partners (September 2022), joined by Qatar and Egypt 
(February 2023).

    Question. Can you assess our relationship with our European and 
Gulf partners, particularly France and Saudi Arabia, on the Lebanon 
file?

    Answer. We continue to work closely with our European and Gulf 
partners--including France and Saudi Arabia--to press Lebanese 
officials on the need to expedite presidential elections and implement 
reforms. Productive engagements to date include a meeting with Saudi 
Arabia and France on the margins of UNGA (September 2022) and a 
February 6 meeting in Paris (which also included Qatar and Egypt) aimed 
at applying joint pressure on Lebanese officials. We remain in regular 
contact with our partners on these issues and look forward to future 
engagements.

              Questions Submitted by Senator Brian Schatz
    Question. The Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony (or STOP) Act 
of 2021, Public Law No. 117-258, was signed into law in December. The 
STOP Act was designed to prevent the international trafficking of 
tribes' sacred items. It requires the Departments of the Interior, 
Justice, State, and Homeland Security to undertake important and 
immediate implementation actions. State, among other things, must 
notify foreign nations of the STOP Act's passage so they can monitor 
imports and facilitate repatriations under their own domestic laws, 
enter into agreements with those foreign nations, and participate in 
the STOP Act's interagency working group. What budgetary resources do 
you anticipate needing to carry out the Department of State's 
responsibilities under the STOP Act?

    Answer. The Department is ready to notify and work with foreign 
governments to facilitate repatriations under the STOP Act. The 
Department also is ready to develop the required trainings and other 
programming, in consultation with Tribes and Native Hawaiian 
organizations, on the voluntary return of cultural heritage for 
Departmental personnel, representatives of Indian Tribes and Native 
Hawaiian organizations, and other stakeholders. We are currently 
evaluating the resources needed to carry out our responsibilities under 
the STOP Act.

    Question. The Pacific Islands countries are vital partners, and it 
is encouraging to see that the State Department will be expanding its 
footprint in the region. However, it is important to recognize that 
working in very remote locations poses real challenges for State 
Department staff and their families. How is the Department planning to 
support staff in the new embassies in the region and what incentives 
are you planning to offer to ensure that those posts are adequately 
staffed?

    Answer. The Department is in the process of enhancing capacity in 
Manila to provide management services and guidance to new embassies in 
the region, and Embassy Port Moresby and Embassy Suva will continue to 
provide Regional Security and Public Diplomacy support. The Department 
is establishing positions and tours of duty. In recognition that 
standard three-year tours of duty may be difficult to staff, the 
Department is in the process of establishing two-year tours and 
evaluating available benefits and allowances to further incentivize 
employees.

    Question. According to the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), U.S. 
funded armaments are required to be used for legitimate self-defense 
purposes. Do you believe that Israeli government personnel use of 
U.S.--origin arms in the course of Palestinian home demolitions, mass 
evictions, and settlement expansion would be in compliance with U.S. 
law, including AECA, which generally prohibits the use of security 
assistance for purposes other than those for which the United States 
provided it?

    Answer. While the United States remains unwavering in its 
commitment to Israel's security, we expect all our allies and partners 
to use U.S.--origin arms consistent with U.S. law for legitimate self-
defense and military purposes. Upon the receipt of credible reports of 
unauthorized end use by a foreign government, we launch an 
investigation to determine an appropriate response and to prevent 
future violations.

    Question. What systems and processes are in place to ensure that 
U.S. funded armaments are in compliance with U.S. law, including 
potential AECA violations?

    Answer. Whether U.S. funded or not, potential arms transfers are 
assessed to ensure that they can be implemented consistent with all 
statutory requirements and with the Conventional Arms Transfer policy. 
With respect to End Use Monitoring (EUM), we have an ongoing security 
relationship with the vast majority of foreign recipients. We are able 
to draw on that background to inform future transfers, and, if dealing 
with a new partner, we assess all available relevant information to 
make the determination. This is an ongoing process, so, as 
circumstances arise, reviews may occur before, during, and after 
delivery. In addition, Leahy Vetting is applied to all U.S. security 
assistance funded transfers.

              Questions Submitted by Senator Susan Collins
    Question. In fiscal year 2023, the Department of Defense began to 
transition its Operation Allies Welcome to the Department of State 
under Operation Enduring Welcome, which focuses on bringing eligible 
Afghans and their families who remain abroad to the United States, 
including those remaining in Afghanistan. Responsibility for the 
program will require the Department of State to manage multiple 
overseas processing platforms for an extended period of time, providing 
life support in addition to visa processing. An estimated $4.8 billion 
in prior appropriated funds, including $3 billion transferred from the 
Department of Defense to the Department of State, are available to 
support Operation Enduring Program. Mr. Secretary, how many principal 
applicants are currently in the Special Immigrant Visa pipeline, and 
what is your best estimate on the time required from start-to-finish 
for these applicants?

    Answer. As of December 31, 2022, there were over 147,000 principal 
applicants in the Afghan SIV pipeline, more than half have submitted 
some, but not all, of the required documentation for Chief of Mission 
approval, and processing times vary on the complexity of each case. We 
are available to discuss with you Enduring Welcome operations and 
Afghan SIV processing in more detail. Additionally, the Department 
publishes a quarterly report on Afghan SIVs which can be found here: 
https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/special-
immg-visa-afghans-employed-us-gov.html#quarterly.

    Question. Are you satisfied with this pace?

    Answer. No. The Department of State seeks to process Special 
Immigrant Visa (SIV) applications and to relocate post-Chief of 
Mission, interview-ready SIVs out of Afghanistan more rapidly. The 
Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts is working as quickly as 
possible to increase its relocation tempo. Many factors in the 
relocation process which impact the pace of operations are out of the 
control of the U.S. government and our Afghan allies to whom we provide 
relocation assistance. We are always available to discuss those factors 
with you.

    Question. The Department of State operates numerous processing 
platforms, including in Qatar. How many Afghans are currently located 
at each platform?

    Answer. That is correct, the Department's principal processing 
location for relocated Afghans is Camp As-Sayliyah in Doha, Qatar. The 
Department currently has processing platforms in Albania and Kosovo as 
well. The U.S. government is also engaged in case processing for 
Afghans at the Emirates Humanitarian City in the United Arab Emirates. 
We are available to discuss with you in more detail.

    Question. Which other countries have offered to take Afghans in, 
and how many has each country taken in?

    Answer. Many countries around the world are providing protection to 
vulnerable Afghans. According to UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 
there are more than 8.2 million Afghans in neighboring countries, 
including 4.5 million in Iran and 3.7 million in Pakistan. Of these, 
more than 1.6 million Afghans arrived in neighboring countries since 
August 2021.

    Question. How many principal applicants in the Special Immigrant 
Visa pipeline remain in Afghanistan?

    Answer. The Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts 
in the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs provides relocation 
assistance to post-Chief of Mission, interview-ready Special Immigrant 
Visa (SIV) cases, provided that the case has undergone pre-travel 
vetting, everyone on the case has a valid Afghan passport, the case can 
be contacted, and everyone on the case is ready and willing to depart 
Afghanistan. We are available to answer questions and discuss specific 
numbers of SIV cases that have been relocated, and specific numbers of 
SIV cases at other stages of the process.

    Question. What is the Department of State's plan to sustain 
Operation Enduring Welcome?

    Answer. The administration requested a new Enduring Welcome account 
in the President's fiscal year 2024 budget to help streamline the 
complex relocation operations and meet our enduring commitment to our 
Afghan allies. Additionally, CARE continues to hire more staff in order 
to meet the needs of the operation as the Department assumes additional 
roles and responsibilities under Enduring Welcome this year.

    Question. Have annual operating costs been determined and what 
resources do you anticipate needing in fiscal year 2025 to sustain the 
mission?

    Answer. We have not yet determined our annual operating costs. We 
expect to have a clearer understanding of our projected long-term costs 
by the end of fiscal year 2023, and are available to discuss with you.

    Question. At what point does the Department of State consider 
``mission accomplished'' regarding Operation Enduring Welcome?

    Answer. The U.S. commitment to relocate and resettle all eligible 
Afghans is enduring. The Department of State intends to continue the 
mission as long as there are eligible Afghans to relocate and resettle.

                                 ______
                                 
             Questions Submitted by Senator Lindsey Graham
    Question. My Senate office is not provided direct answers when 
inquiring about SIV/P1/P2 cases. My staff has attended a number of case 
management calls and, quite frankly, they do not receive answers to 
their questions, including regarding case specific questions. 
Furthermore, when case inquiries are submitted to the CAREHillInquries 
mailbox, my office only receives unhelpful, boilerplate responses. The 
information my office receives is of little use, and in turn we have 
very little useful information to help provide answers to those who 
have submitted cases or reached out for assistance.
    Additionally, there was a particular case where I wrote a letter to 
the Department of State asking for assistance for an Afghan service 
member I served alongside in Afghanistan. My office corresponded with 
the Department of State multiple times about his ``case'' and was told 
it was being tracked, only to find out this month--one and half years 
later--that he never actually had an active case. We have since asked 
the Department of State to provide information that we could share with 
him on how he can go about submitting a P1 or P2 application. We have 
yet to receive a response to this inquiry. Overall, the failure to 
provide specific answers to the majority of inquiries submitted by my 
office indicates the Department of State lacks a coherent plan of 
action to process these cases. This is unsatisfactory and disgraceful, 
particularly to those of us who served in Afghanistan. In January 2023, 
the Department of State informed my office there was a backlog of over 
60,000 SIV applications awaiting Chief of Mission (COM) approval. While 
their cases await COM approval, our Afghan allies who fought alongside 
us now struggle to provide for themselves and their families, remain in 
hiding, and live in constant fear of being hunted down by the Taliban. 
Does the Department of State have a comprehensive plan to work the COM 
approval backlog? If so, what is that plan?

    Answer. The Department continues to prioritize processing cases 
through the Chief of Mission (COM) approval backlog by surging staffing 
in the office reviewing applications for COM approvals and prioritizing 
the most vulnerable Afghans. We continue to coordinate with interagency 
partners, such as the Department of Defense, to quickly provide missing 
documentation and evidence of qualifying employment. We are also 
improving both the efficiency and pace of processing applications for 
COM approval, including through bulk verification of applicant's 
employment under U.S. government contracts.

    Question. What is the estimated time period it will take the 
Department of State to clear the COM approval backlog?

    Answer. Increased staffing and resources directed towards the Chief 
of Mission (COM) approval backlog means in the near future we will be 
able to process significantly greater numbers of cases and make 
progress toward reducing the COM approval backlog. Because we have not 
finished surging staffing and resources, it is difficult to accurately 
estimate when the Department will be able to clear the COM approval 
backlog. We are certainly available to discuss in more detail with you.

    Question. Are there additional resources the United States Congress 
can work to provide the Department of State to assist them in working 
through the COM approval backlog?

    Answer. I am personally committed to keeping our promises to those 
who stood by us in Afghanistan. We have surged resources and increased 
staff dedicated to SIV processing. The efficient processing and 
ultimate resettlement of Afghans continues apace and remains among my 
highest priorities. Congress's continued support of our efforts to 
resource and staff our team working through the Chief of Mission 
approval will help the Department to sustain these efforts.

    Question. Since July 2022, my office has been told the United 
States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) is in the process of 
establishing a new Resettlement Support Center (RSC) in Pakistan to 
process Afghan P1 and P2 cases. As of December 2022, 7,500 Afghan P1/P2 
applicants have relocated to more than 50 countries, and of the 7,500 
number, several thousand of those cases are for Afghans in Pakistan. 
What is the Department of State doing to process Afghan P1/P2 cases in 
Pakistan while they wait for the RSC to become operational?

    Answer. The Department remains committed to processing U.S. Refugee 
Admissions Program (USRAP) cases for Afghans in third countries, 
including Pakistan. We continue to engage at senior levels with 
Pakistani officials frequently, both in Islamabad and Washington, on 
this issue, and we are actively pursuing all potentially viable options 
to enable USRAP processing in Pakistan.

    Question. How much longer does the Department of State expect it to 
be before the Government of Pakistan grants final approval for the RSC 
to become operational?

    Answer. We cannot forecast a precise timeline for Pakistan's 
approval to begin U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) processing 
for Afghan applicants. This remains a priority for me, and we continue 
to work with our Pakistani counterparts as they evaluate the request, 
so we can address any concerns and underscore the benefits of approving 
USRAP processing. The Department of State would be happy to brief you 
on these issues.

    Question. What specific actions is the Department of State taking 
to engage the Government of Pakistan on this issue?

    Answer. Thank you for your support. We are available to discuss 
details with you.

    Question. The Department of State has stated they anticipate the 
processing of Afghan P1/P2 cases to take approximately 12-18 months. Is 
the Department of State exploring options to speed up the processing 
times for P1/P2 cases? If so, what are these options?

    Answer. The Department's Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) 
Bureau and partners have worked hard to expedite processing of Afghan 
P1/P2 cases, particularly at Camp As Sayliyah, where processing times 
are now down to 30 to 45 days for individuals without serious medical 
conditions or security vetting delays. PRM is working to increase 
efficiencies and reduce processing times for USRAP cases globally, with 
a goal of reducing processing times from the 12-18-month average down 
to 6 months.

    Question. Please provide the following information regarding 
evacuation flights from Kabul: What is the status of evacuation flights 
from Kabul? Are they ongoing, or will they be restarted? If restarting, 
when are such flights expected to resume?

    Answer. The Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts 
(SCA/CARE) carries out regular movements to relocate eligible Afghans 
out of Afghanistan by air and overland routes. Despite a range of 
obstacles, CARE's relocation movements have become more consistent and 
repeatable over time.

    Question. What are/will be the frequency of such flights out of 
Kabul?

    Answer. Multiple flights take place per week; however, these 
movements are sensitive because of the operating environments in 
Afghanistan and are subject to conditions and rules in downstream 
locations.

    Question. How will Afghans be able to manifest themselves onto such 
flights?

    Answer. The Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts 
(SCA/CARE) immediately manifests every U.S. citizen and Legal Permanent 
Resident (LPR) who requests relocation assistance. CARE also manifests 
for relocation each post-Chief of Mission (COM) interview-ready SIV 
case, eligible interview-ready IV case, and eligible refugee case, 
provided that every individual on the case is ready and willing to 
relocate. These individuals must have a valid passport, must be 
successfully contacted, and must clear pre-travel vetting. Travelers 
are contacted by CARE's contact center (in English, Dari, and Pashto) 
before a flight.

    Question. What will be the number of people these flights will be 
able to manifest, on a per flight basis?

    Answer. Given the operational sensitivity and the safety of these 
travelers, we are available to discuss these numbers with you in 
another setting.

    Question. Please provide, in a timely manner, specific updates and 
estimates regarding the processing time for the following cases: 
Rahmanullah Sediqi; Case Number: NVCSIV2021194099.

    Answer. Due to the confidentiality of visa records, we cannot 
comment on specific cases in this public format. Please forward this 
inquiry to consularonthehill@state.gov. Additionally, we are available 
to discuss this further with you.

    Question. Please provide, in a timely manner, specific updates and 
estimates regarding the processing time for the following cases Abdul 
Razaq Baray; Case Number: PK-10032094.

    Answer. The applicant you reference has an active USRAP case. We 
are not able to provide a timeline for case processing. We can provide

    Question. Please provide, in a timely manner, specific updates and 
estimates regarding the processing time for the following cases: Basir 
Quraishi; Case Number: PK-10022836.

    Answer. The applicant you referenced has an active USRAP case. We 
are not able to provide a processing timeline. We can provide you a 
briefing about this case.

    Question. In 2019, travelers spent $16.9 billion in South Carolina, 
which supported nearly 140,000 jobs. Currently, overseas visitation to 
South Carolina remains 21 percent below 2019 levels, in part due to 
long visa interview wait times. Expanding this to apply to the United 
States, 35 million (43 percent) of international visitors and $120 
billion in spending (50 percent) came from countries where a visa is 
required to enter the United States in 2019. In 2023, Tourism Economics 
forecasts that American businesses would attract 2.6 million fewer 
international visitors and $7 billion less in spending as a result of 
international travelers being unable to obtain a visitor visa in time 
to travel to the United States. Is the Department of State tracking at 
which consulates and in what countries it takes the longest to get a 
visa interview? If so, can you explain what the Department of State is 
doing to improve the situation at those consulates and in those 
countries that are experiencing wait times above 180 days?

    Answer. Long wait times for interviews apply only to first-time 
tourist visa applicants--a very small percentage of entries to the 
United States. In all other categories important to the U.S. economy--
students, temporary workers, repeat travelers, and maritime crew--wait 
times are at prepandemic levels or lower. We are available to discuss 
further with you.

    Question. Can the Department of State provide an assessment as to 
what impact long interview wait times have on the recovery of 
international inbound travel?

    Answer. Only eight of the top 20 inbound visitor nationalities 
require a U.S. tourist visa. In the first 5 months of fiscal year 2023, 
we issued 18 percent more nonimmigrant visas (NIV) globally than during 
the same period in fiscal year 2019. Today there are almost 60 million 
valid multiple-entry visitor visas and border crossing cards in 
circulation worldwide. This huge pool of prospective travelers with 
valid visas, and our continued visa issuance trends suggest the reasons 
for the slow recovery of inbound travel are complex--for example, there 
are reduced levels of inbound travel by citizens of Visa Waiver Program 
countries, who make up the majority of U.S. tourists.

    Question. What resources does the Department of State need to lower 
interview wait times?

    Answer. Since early 2022, the Department reduced gaps in consular 
staffing overseas caused by the drop in fee revenue due to the 
pandemic's near-shutdown of international travel. With the resurgence 
of travel, the Bureau of Consular Affairs' financial situation has 
improved. The Department is striving to ensure that as many 
adjudicators as possible are assigned to overseas positions to reach 
worldwide pre-pandemic staffing by the end of this year. Maintaining 
expanded spending authorities and additional fee flexibilities would 
help allow for continued innovation and additional hiring.

    Question. The Department of State is currently facing an 
unprecedented backlog of passport applications while at the same time 
experiencing passport processing times that are close to reaching a 
historic high. As a result, many citizens are missing travel, or in 
certain cases, unable to make emergency travel, due to a lack of 
counter service walkthrough appointments. Looking at the Southern 
United States, the Atlanta Passport Agency is the only agency to offer 
in-person counter service walkthrough appointments near Georgia, South 
Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama. The population of 
these 5 States that the Atlanta Passport Agency has to service is 
roughly 38.5 million. Meanwhile, California alone has three passport 
agencies in their State to service their roughly equivalent population 
of 39.2 million. To alleviate this problem, I proposed language in the 
Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs 
Appropriations Act, 2023 that required the Secretary of State to 
consult with the Committees on Appropriations on the operations of the 
Charleston Passport Center, particularly the need for in-person 
constituent appointments. During this consultation, the Department of 
State informed the Committee that opening up the Charleston Passport 
Center for in-person counter service walkthrough appointments would 
present a number of challenges. Please provide the following, in a 
timely manner: A detailed explanation of why opening up the Charleston 
Passport Center for in-person counter service walkthrough appointments 
presents challenges to the Department of State, including an 
enumeration of such challenges.

    Answer. The Charleston Passport Center (CPC) is located on a secure 
government compound, home to non-public-facing operations of eight 
State Department offices. Opening counter operations at CPC would 
divert resources from other Passport priorities and divert CPC's focus 
from specialized service (for Federal and military employees and their 
families) and existing economies of scale. Construction to add counter 
service would disrupt CPC operations for years. In 2021, we calculated 
that 99.4 percent of the U.S. public resided within 25 miles of an 
acceptance facility. We are available to answer any other questions you 
have about the CPC.

    Question. Please provide the following, in a timely manner: A 
detailed plan addressing how in-person counter service walkthrough 
appointments passport appointment backlogs can be prevented in the 
Southern United States, particularly at the Atlanta Passport Agency.

    Answer. The Department's modernization efforts, including Online 
Passport Renewal and other initiatives, will offer faster processing 
for emergency cases and potentially spare customers an agency visit 
altogether. In 2021, we calculated that 99.4 percent of the U.S. public 
resided within 25 miles of an acceptance facility. Travelers who can 
plan ahead do not need to visit a passport agency; they may apply by 
mail or at an acceptance facility. While we anticipate moving the 
Atlanta Passport Agency to larger space in a few years, systems 
modernization will benefit your constituents more.

    Question. Please provide the following, in a timely manner: An 
estimate of the number of United States citizens who will be unable to 
have their passport processed before their scheduled overseas trip due 
to the failure to open up an additional processing center for in-person 
counter service walkthrough appointments in the Southern United States.

    Answer. We do not collect or verify data on the number of U.S. 
citizens who may have potentially missed their trip. From January 1 to 
April 6, our staff served more than 269,000 customers with emergency or 
urgent travel at our counters and issued more than 4.7 million 
passports for customers who applied through the mail. We strongly 
recommend customers apply early, and by mail or at an acceptance 
facility, and undertake public messaging campaigns to this effect.

              Questions Submitted by Senator John Boozman
    Question. According to the World Food Programme, Ukraine produced 
enough to feed 400 million people prior to the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has not only caused tragic loss of life and 
catastrophic damage, but has also fueled the global food crisis, 
leaving those millions of people dependent on Ukraine's food supply 
vulnerable to starvation. The Black Sea grain deal has been integral to 
vulnerable countries, and was recently extended 60 days. However, the 
deal faces renewal again shortly, in mid-May. Can you elaborate on how 
the negotiations to renew are proceeding, and if this is a State 
Department priority?

    Answer. Our position has always been clear: The world needs the 
Black Sea Grain Initiative (BGSI). The United States strongly supports 
the efforts of Secretary-General Guterres, in partnership with Turkiye, 
to expand and extend this life-saving Initiative. Russia continues to 
use global food supplies as a weapon of war by threatening the future 
of the BSGI, and this must be resisted. The United States welcomed the 
UN's announcement on March 18 that the Initiative had been extended and 
we continue to work with the UN and other countries to extend and 
expand the grain deal.

    Question. Additionally, can you explain the biggest obstacles 
facing a long-term renewal?

    Answer. The Black Sea Grain Initiative renews automatically for 
120-day terms unless one of the parties' objects. We have seen comments 
from Russian officials casting doubt on their interest in sustaining 
the Initiative; we have also seen Russia obstruct operations and, once, 
suspend its participation in the Initiative. Russia has consistently 
spread misinformation about the agreement's impact on global food 
security. We have worked extensively to combat correct Russia's false 
claims, including that its food and fertilizer are impeded by Western 
sanctions.

    Question. Food Security East Africa: Last fall, I traveled to East 
Africa and saw the impact firsthand of conflict in the Horn of Africa, 
which leads many to seek refuge in Kenya and other surrounding 
countries. However, the unrelenting drought in this region means all 
countries face a significant food shortage. These and other vulnerable 
countries depend on UN humanitarian response agencies such as the World 
Food Program and US foreign hunger assistance programs be able to feed 
their people during a crisis. What programs, tools, and partnerships 
are the State Department and USAID relying on now to address this 
global hunger crisis, and what so far has been most effective?

    Answer. The State Department and the U.S. Agency for International 
Development (USAID) use a multi-tool approach to direct interventions 
to address global food insecurity. A combination of short-term 
emergency assistance and longer-term systemic support, through programs 
like Feed the Future, are designed to alleviate the acute suffering and 
contribute to sustainable farming practices in the Horn of Africa and 
throughout the Global South. State and USAID depend on our investments 
through the UN system and our partnerships with the African Union to 
implement programs and encourage other major donor countries to provide 
funding. The combination of all our efforts is the most effective 
response.

    Question. As you know, Hunger causes civil instability and drives 
conflict, and is a national security concern. For example, China has 
made significant investments in Africa through the Belt and Road 
Initiative. I hear from many leaders in Africa that they want to work 
with the U.S., but we are never at the negotiating table, unlike China. 
Has China used the global food crisis as an opportunity to make deals 
with vulnerable countries, both in Africa and elsewhere, that could 
threaten national security? If so, what has been the administration's 
response?

    Answer. The PRC's efforts to increase its presence and influence in 
Africa are intended to advance and ultimately export its domestic 
political, security, information, and economic goals as well as justify 
its domestic agenda on the world stage. We push back on corrupt or 
coercive practices that damage our interests and those of our African 
partners while offering alternatives in collaboration with our African 
and other partners. We do not ask our partners to choose between the 
United States and the PRC. Instead, we give them choices on how to 
deliver results to their citizens.

    Question. As you also know, the renewal of our Compacts of Free 
Association is due this year. Arkansas has the largest population of 
Marshallese than anywhere else in the U.S. Can you provide an update on 
how those negotiations are proceeding?

    Answer. The Compact-related negotiations with the Freely Associated 
States are crucial to deepening these strategic partnerships in support 
of a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific. Having signed Memoranda of 
Understanding reflecting the levels and types of future U.S. assistance 
for each country that we intend to request, we are now focused on 
negotiating the agreement texts. The administration then expects to 
submit a proposal for implementing legislation with necessary 
authorities and mandatory appropriations to fund the costs of future 
Compact assistance for the expected 20-year period.

    Question. Additionally, can you elaborate on other programs and 
plans the administration is planning to implement in the Indo-Pacific, 
and how it would lower China's influence?

    Answer. The fiscal year 2024 budget request advances partnerships 
in the Indo-Pacific and supports initiatives to out-compete the 
People's Republic of China. The request includes $2.1 billion in 
discretionary funding for the Indo-Pacific, $7.1 billion for funding 
related to the Compacts of Free Association, which includes $6.5 
billion in economic assistance and $0.6 billion to support provision of 
postal services, and $2 billion over 5 years in mandatory funding to 
support game-changing investments in the Indo-Pacific and support 
partners' efforts to push back against predatory activities.

              Questions Submitted by Senator Bill Hagerty
    Question. U.S. energy, especially natural gas, played an outsized 
role in preventing the worst case outcomes for European energy markets 
last year. The U.S. is the world's largest producer of natural gas, the 
largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, and as of last year, the 
largest supplier of LNG to Europe. In March of last year, the Biden 
administration and the E.U. Commission issued a joint commitment 
focused on enhancing energy security, which included many commitments 
from the United States to remain a reliable long-term supplier of 
energy to our allies overseas. One of those Commitments was to maintain 
``an enabling regulatory environment'' for natural gas infrastructure 
projects. Similar commitments have been made to the UK and Japan. In 
fact, it is quite difficult to build energy infrastructure projects 
here in the United States. Do you agree that U.S. LNG has been critical 
to the world's energy security, and do you believe it will remain 
critical going forward?

    Answer. U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) has played a pivotal role 
in Europe's energy security. Our LNG exports to the EU and the UK 
increased by 140 percent over the full year of 2022 to over 70 billion 
cubic meters. Additionally, about 64 percent of total U.S. LNG exports 
went to the UK and EU in 2022--and this represented about half of the 
region's LNG imports. LNG supplies from the United States and other 
reliable suppliers, and Europe's increasing focus on energy efficiency, 
will help Europe meet next winter's demand peak. U.S. LNG will continue 
to play an important role in Europe's energy security.

    Question. What has the administration done, or planned to do, to 
ensure we can meet our commitments to our allies?

    Answer. We are engaging our allies multilaterally through entities 
such as the International Energy Agency, regionally through forums such 
as the U.S.--EU Energy Council, and bilaterally through initiatives 
like the U.S.--Japan Energy Security Dialogue, to advance energy 
security and the energy transition. The United States also became the 
world's largest LNG exporter in 2022, sending record amounts of gas to 
Europe, and we are working with our EU partners to advance energy 
efficiency and to accelerate the energy transition. We will continue to 
support the energy security of our allies and partners.

    Question. When you last appeared before the Senate Appropriations 
Committee in April 2022, we discussed the importance of reliable access 
to cost-effective sources of energy for like-minded partners in the 
Quad. You said that was an interesting idea and that you would come 
back to me. Since then, Japan has brought up energy security and 
investment with, only to be rebuffed by many G7 members like Germany, 
who are pursuing the exact same strategy. Has the State Department 
created an energy security working group within the Quad since your 
answer last year?

    Answer. The Department of State is working with Quad partners to 
increase our collective energy security by focusing efforts to develop 
and diversify critical minerals and energy supply chains, while 
promoting greater investment to advance the energy transition that will 
increase access to cost-effective sources of energy. These efforts 
complement G7 and Indo-Pacific Economic Framework priorities to enhance 
energy security, decarbonization, and access.

    Question. Does the Biden administration support having energy 
security as part of this year's G7 agenda, including the role of U.S. 
natural gas in strengthening that energy security?

    Answer. The United States is working closely with Japan, the G7 
President, on enhancing global energy security, which includes a role 
for U.S. natural gas, particularly in the context of Russia's ongoing 
war of aggression against Ukraine. The administration is in close 
consultation with Japan and other G7 partners to advance global energy 
security and the clean energy transition simultaneously. Japan, as both 
a major energy consumer and technological innovator, will play a vital 
role in these closely intertwined global efforts.

    Question. Wouldn't the G7's refusal to expand LNG investment 
prolong Europe's and India's dependence on Russian energy and help 
finance President Putin's war against Ukraine?

    Answer. G7 Leaders will meet in Hiroshima May 19-21. We are in 
close consultation with Japan and other G7 partners to advance global 
energy security and the clean energy transition simultaneously. Japan, 
as both a major energy consumer and technological innovator, will play 
a vital role in these closely intertwined global efforts. There is a 
role for LNG, particularly in the context of Russia's ongoing war of 
aggression against Ukraine.

    Question. Chinese carriers currently use Russian airspace to arrive 
and depart from the United States. Chinese carriers pay the Russian 
government to access Russian airspace. The use of Russian airspace 
presents safety concerns for U.S. passengers on these flights in the 
case of a diversion for mechanical, medical, or other reasons. 
Moreover, Chinese use of Russian airspace gives Chinese carriers 
significant competitive advantages over U.S. passenger carriers and 
workers as the use of Russian airspace significantly reduces flying 
time, costs, fuel, and allows Chinese carriers to load their planes to 
maximum capacity. The use of Russian airspace also provides funding for 
the war in Ukraine. Under a Department of Transportation Order from 
2021 current flights between the United States and China are limited to 
eight roundtrips per side. If the existing U.S.-China bilateral 
agreement comes back into full effect, Chinese carriers would be 
entitled to 180 weekly roundtrips from three major cities in China to 
the U.S., whereas U.S. carriers would have 154 weekly roundtrips. What 
are the State Department's plans on this issue?

    Answer. The Department is concerned about third country air 
carriers that operate flights to and from the United States via Russian 
airspace. We continue to track and coordinate closely with interagency 
colleagues to identify potential responses consistent with domestic and 
international legal obligations. We continue to pursue a measured 
approach to the increase of flights in the U.S.-PRC aviation market 
that ensures parity and a level playing field for both countries' 
carriers.

    Question. Will you commit not to increase flights from China above 
the current limits until the Chinese government agrees not to utilize 
Russian airspace to or from the United States?

    Answer. We continue to track this issue closely with interagency 
colleagues and maintain a measured approach to any increase of flights 
in the U.S.-PRC aviation market. Our goal is to ensure parity and a 
level playing field so that any increase in flights equally benefits 
U.S. carriers.

    Question. U.S. officials were publicly talking about ``victory'' 
and inflicting a ``strategic defeat'' on Russia that would leave it 
``weakened.'' President Biden has repeatedly vowed to support Ukraine 
``as long as it takes.'' However, in November, the NYT reported that 
the administration was privately encouraging Ukraine's leaders to 
negotiate with Russia. In December, you suggested that Crimea and the 
Donbas be resolved later. In January, the NYT reported the 
administration softened its hard line against providing Ukraine 
offensive weapons and assessed that Ukrainian pressure on Crimea would 
strengthen Kyiv's position in any future negotiations. What is the 
Biden administration's desired end state for this conflict? To restore 
the status quo ante before Putin's invasion or to force Putin to return 
territory he seized in 2014, including Crimea?

    Answer. Our desired end state for this conflict is a Ukraine that 
is sovereign, independent, and secure within its internationally-
recognized borders. That includes all territory of Ukraine currently 
occupied by Russia--Crimea, Zaporizhzhya, Kherson, Luhansk, and Donetsk 
oblasts. We have said repeatedly that this war must end in negotiated 
settlement, but the ``end state'' is ultimately a decision for Ukraine 
to make. We will continue to support Ukraine on the battlefield and 
through our economic and humanitarian assistance.

    Question. What is your assessment on what conditions be required 
for Putin to accept a negotiated peace?

    Answer. President Putin started this war with the aim to 
effectively erase Ukraine's independence and sovereignty, and control 
over Ukraine remains the Kremlin's ultimate objective. Short of that 
goal, Putin may consider as an interim step consolidating control of 
occupied Ukrainian territory, resting and refitting his forces, and 
resuming his aggression against Ukraine when able. He has shown no 
willingness to engage in good-faith negotiations to end the war he 
started. It is imperative that Ukraine possess the means to effectively 
deter and defend itself against further Russian aggression.

    Question. What is your assessment on Putin's willingness to use 
nuclear weapons as the war drags on?

    Answer. Russia has resorted to irresponsible and unacceptable 
nuclear rhetoric throughout its unprovoked and brutal full-scale 
invasion of Ukraine. The United States, however, has not seen 
indications or preparations that Russia is planning imminent nuclear 
use. Whether that will change over time is uncertain. The costs of such 
use have been made clear by the international community. The United 
States and its fellow G7 members have stated any Russian use of nuclear 
weapons would be met with severe consequences.I would defer to the 
Intelligence Community for a classified assessment.

    Question. Would Ukraine's attempt to seize Crimea or the Donbas 
prompt Putin to consider using nuclear weapons?

    Answer. What exactly would prompt Putin to consider using nuclear 
weapons would be a matter of speculation. The costs of any such use 
have been made clear to Russia by the international community. The 
United States and its fellow G7 members have stated any Russian use of 
nuclear weapons would be met with severe consequences. I would defer to 
the Intelligence Community for a classified assessment.

    Question. What is your assessment on how stable Vladimir Putin's 
hold on power is in the Kremlin?

    Answer. Though the Russian government's forced partial mobilization 
last fall provoked criticism and alarm from many Russians, Putin 
controls the main levers of security and information in Russia. The 
Kremlin ruthlessly represses dissent and opposition voices and 
promulgates false narratives about the war against Ukraine to maintain 
power.

    Question. Taiwan's arms backlog remains roughly $19 billion despite 
senior Pentagon officials' assessment that China will be capable of 
invading Taiwan by 2027. The fiscal year 2023 National Defense 
Authorization Act authorizes up-to-$2 billion in grants of Foreign 
Military Financing to Taiwan between now and 2027. It also authorizes 
$1 billion per year in Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) to 
transfer defense articles to Taiwan in the event of an emergency. This 
is the same authorization that President Joe Biden used to send 
billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine for defense against Russia's 
invasion; indeed, since February 2022, the Biden administration has 
directed 30 drawdowns under PDA totaling approximately $18.3 billion in 
weaponry from the Department of Defense, including HIMARS, Stingers, 
and Javelins. In your hearing, you claimed that the State Department's 
budget request did not seek an appropriation to fully fund foreign 
military financing and PDA to support Taiwan because the problem with 
foreign military sales was one of defense industry ``capacity.'' Why 
did the State Department budget request for Fiscal Year 2024 not 
include a request to fund the up-to-$2 billion in grants of Foreign 
Military Financing to Taiwan between now and 2027 that was authorized 
in SFRC Chairman Robert Menendez's Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act 
(``TERA'')?

    Answer. The Department appreciates the authorizations in the Taiwan 
Enhanced Resilience Act of Foreign Military Financing (FMF) grant 
assistance to Taiwan, and continues to explore options for Taiwan. This 
budget request includes $113 million to address emerging priorities 
globally, which may include Taiwan. A strategic allocation of FMF could 
be accomplished with increased flexibility within the annual 
appropriations bill.

    Question. Why did the State Department budget request for Fiscal 
Year 2024 not include a request to fund the $1 billion in PDA to 
support Taiwan that was authorized in TERA to proactively provide arms 
necessary for Taiwan to deter a possible Chinese invasion of the 
island?

    Answer. The Department recognizes the drawdown authority is one of 
the U.S. government's most valuable tools to quickly provide defense 
articles to foreign partners. There are numerous policy and national 
security implications the United States must consider before the 
President decides whether to authorize a drawdown. Any decision to 
exercise the new drawdown authority would not require a corresponding 
appropriation as it is an authority to draw down from existing DoD 
stocks.

    Question. To what extent has the United States sent weapons to 
Ukraine via PDA that could also be used for an asymmetric defense of 
Taiwan?

    Answer. Support to Ukraine and support to Taiwan are not mutually 
exclusive. There are similarities and differences to our partners' 
defense needs, and capabilities prioritized for Taiwan are often the 
same systems that enhance the capabilities of many partners and allies. 
Some of the systems transferred to Ukraine under the military 
assistance drawdown authority align with some of Taiwan's priorities 
for acquisition, though the specific variant may be different.

    Question. Given the threat and stakes, will the administration 
commit to prioritizing delivering weapons to Taiwan ahead other 
countries? If so, how will you ensure this is done quickly and 
effectively? If the administration believes it is unable to deliver 
weapons to Taiwan ahead of other countries for legal reasons, please 
explain why.

    Answer. The U.S. government has limited flexibility to influence 
the order in which Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requests are fulfilled, 
and individual foreign partners are not automatically prioritized 
within the FMS process. Numerous factors determine the production 
queue, including the order that customers finalize and fund contracts, 
current DoD requirements, and the system and specific variant ordered. 
Prioritizing one partner would result in significant cost increases to 
that partner and likely cause the United States to miss contractual 
obligations with other partners.

    Question. What steps is the administration taking to ensure the 
U.S. defense industrial base is prepared to replenish depleted U.S. 
weapons stockpiles and ramp up production to prepare for a possible 
major regional conflict in the Indo-Pacific?

    Answer. I refer you to the Department of Defense, which holds the 
authority for contracting with U.S. companies for maintenance and 
potential contingency stockpiling.

    Question. Could our European allies provide more military 
assistance to Ukraine?

    Answer. More than 50 of our Allies and partners have publicly 
committed over $24.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since 
February 2022 and we continue to work closely with them to increase 
military equipment provisions to Ukraine. Additionally, several of 
these countries have provided training.

    Question. What are we doing to pressure our European allies to do 
more?

    Answer. We continue to encourage our Allies and partners to provide 
the necessary military equipment Ukraine needs. I and other Department 
officials regularly raise Ukraine's needs with foreign counterparts in-
person, on calls, and in multilateral settings, and will continue to do 
so for as long as it takes to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia's 
further invasion.

    Question. Would a greater and more rapid European contribution of 
security assistance to Ukraine allow the United States to devote more 
of its strained defense industrial capacity to arming Taiwan?

    Answer. Most European partners have supported Ukraine 
diplomatically, economically, and with military hardware and training. 
For example, at nearly 1 percent of GDP, Latvia's total assistance 
commitment is proportionally nearly four times that of the United 
States, while Estonia has donated the equivalent of nearly half of its 
annual defense budget to Ukraine. Efforts to support the timely 
delivery of defense articles to Taiwan need to prioritize expanding 
production capacity.

    Question. The U.S. intelligence community reportedly estimated back 
in 2018 that Mexican drug cartels controlled more than 20 percent of 
Mexican territory--a percentage I'm certain has grown. The cartels also 
control large swathes of terrain across our southern border. Moreover, 
these cartels are responsible for almost all illicit drugs coming 
across our border. President Biden's Executive Order 14059 authorizes 
sanctions against foreign persons who provide--or facilitate the 
provision of--material support to the cartels. Why hasn't the Biden 
administration used existing sanctions authorities against Mexican 
government officials, including governors, who help the cartels?

    Answer. The Department coordinates with the Department of the 
Treasury in support of Executive Order 14059. We have and will continue 
to use existing sanctions authorities against those involved in 
trafficking drugs into the United States.

    Question. Is it acceptable that President Lopez Obrador is not 
taking aggressive action to degrade the drug cartels?

    Answer. Through the Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public 
Health, and Safe Communities, we work closely with Mexican counterparts 
to address our shared security challenges, most notably the 
transnational criminal organizations responsible for trafficking 
illicit drugs into the United States and the associated violence in 
Mexico. I led two High Level Security Dialogues (in 2021 and 2022), 
along with my colleagues from the Departments of Justice and Homeland 
Security, where I urged the Mexican government to strengthen its 
efforts to curb fentanyl production and trafficking.

    Question. What other tools is the Biden administration using to 
compel the Mexican government to take decisive action?

    Answer. For years, the United States and Mexico have worked as 
partners to combat transnational criminal organizations (TCOs). Through 
the Bicentennial Framework, the United States and Mexico have increased 
joint efforts to combat production of synthetic and other illicit 
drugs, increase drug interdictions, pursue prosecutions of TCOs and 
their finances, and reduce the amount of illicit goods crossing the 
U.S.-Mexico border. We also committed to implement a joint synthetic 
drug action plan at the 2022 High-Level Security Dialogue to complement 
ongoing cooperation.

    Question. Do you assess that Mexico is at risk of becoming a narco-
state?

    Answer. No. Mexico is a long-standing partner in the fight against 
transnational crime. During the two High Level Security Dialogues I led 
in 2021 and 2022, the United States and Mexico committed to increasing 
our efforts to disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal 
organizations, and to strengthen Mexican capacity to improve the rule 
of law and curb fentanyl production and trafficking through the 
Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe 
Communities.

    Question. Please provide a list of all non-governmental 
organizations, including prime awardees and sub awardees, in Israel, 
West Bank, and Gaza that have received any funding from the U.S. 
government, including but not limited to the State Dept., NED, and MEPI 
beginning January 1, 2021 to the present day. The list should include 
the names of the prime awardees and sub awardees receiving any U.S. 
funding, the date and duration of the funding provided, the total 
amount of funding that has been and will be provided, the 
instrumentality of the United States government that is providing the 
funding, and the stated propose of the funding.

    Answer. The Department is working to assemble and provide the 
requested information. We would refer you to NED for information on 
their programming.

    Question. The Biden administration has dramatically expanded U.S. 
assistance to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine 
Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in spite of substantial evidence that 
indicates that UNRWA has contributed to Palestinian extremism and that 
Palestinian schools administered by UNRWA, have used textbooks and 
allowed the presence of materials that delegitimize Israel, denigrate 
Jews, and venerate martyrdom. In spite of the likelihood that UNRWA 
employs individuals affiliated with U.S.--designated terrorist 
organization Hamas, the United States does not condition aid to UNRWA 
on counter-terrorism vetting for staff, contractors, and recipients of 
UNRWA funds. Unlike USAID, where all grants must pass counter-terrorism 
vetting before funds are received, no similar mechanism is in place to 
ensure funds allocated to UNRWA do not get into the hands of people 
affiliated with Hamas and other terrorist organizations. Right now 
there is no accountability on this front: taking UNRWA's word for it is 
not a substitute for an independent audit. When was the last time the 
State Department conducted an audit of UNRWA?

    Answer. I unequivocally condemn all forms of incitement to violence 
and antisemitism. The United States provides vigorous oversight of 
UNRWA's commitment to neutrality and to prevent funds from benefitting 
terrorists via our U.S.--UNRWA Framework for Cooperation. Department 
oversight includes site visits, weekly meetings with UNRWA, quarterly 
checks of UNRWA contractors receiving more than $10,000, and following 
up on UNRWA and UN audit findings and UNRWA's extensive reporting. We 
take oversight seriously and meet with stakeholders--including the 
government of Israel--to resolve concerns.

    Question. Are you in favor of conditioning UNRWA funds on the 
completion of an independently conducted and verified counter-terrorism 
vetting process--similar to the protocol followed for staff of USAID 
aid recipients--that ensures that recipients of funds, or at minimum 
the staff and contractors of institutions receiving funds, are not 
being affiliated with terrorist organizations such as Hamas? Please 
begin your answer with a yes or no. If not, on what grounds do you find 
it acceptable that the United States taxpayer funds are going to 
organizations that contribute to the perpetuation of violent extremism 
and anti-Semitism and are not willing to undergo counter-terrorism 
vetting.

    Answer. Antisemitism and incitement to violence are unacceptable. 
The State Department monitors the United Nations Relief and Works 
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East's (UNRWA) adherence to 
stringent policies to uphold neutrality and prevent funds from 
benefiting terrorists. This includes UNRWA screening all staff and 
beneficiaries for terrorism and terrorist financing concerns; sharing 
staff lists with host authorities including Israel and the Palestinian 
Authority; prohibiting UNRWA staff participation in political 
activities; and reviewing all host country curricula and instructing 
teachers how to address issues inconsistent with UN values and its 
neutrality framework.

    Question. Last year, the United States seemingly spared no expense 
and utilized every resource to bring Brittney Griner home from Russia. 
How do you explain the difference in the urgency with which the 
administration approached for the Griner case compared to the urgency 
it has approached other cases of wrongful detention?

    Answer. The President's and my commitment to this issue is clear: 
there is no higher priority than the safety and security of all U.S. 
citizens around the world, and that includes seeking the release of 
those who are wrongfully detained or held hostage. We treat all 
wrongful detention cases with the urgency they deserve and have brought 
home dozens of U.S. nationals so far.

    Question. What message do you have for other families who continue 
to wait for their own wrongfully detained loved ones to return home, 
have yet to meet with the President despite attempts to do so, and feel 
as though the administration is not prioritizing their own cases in the 
same way?

    Answer. Whether someone receives a meeting with the President or 
not, the administration is always working equally hard to resolve each 
of these cases. I realize that meeting the President himself is an 
important event for these families, and I know that the President is 
aware of all U.S. national wrongful detention cases and feels 
passionately about bringing wrongful detainees home.

    Question. Do you believe these individuals should meet with the 
President?

    Answer. Whether someone receives a meeting with the President or 
not, the administration is always working equally hard to resolve each 
of these cases. I realize that meeting the President himself is an 
important event for these families, and I know that the President is 
aware of all U.S. national wrongful detention cases and feels 
passionately about bringing wrongful detainees home.

    Question. What can you commit to for these families?

    Answer. This administration is committed to the return of every 
U.S. national hostage and wrongful detainee and has brought home dozens 
of Americans so far. We have two critical imperatives in this space: 
securing the release of U.S. nationals while also promoting 
accountability and deterring those who would engage in this practice. 
Our goal is also to support the families; we aim to ensure families of 
wrongful detainees have access to the support they need. We are 
confident we can do all three, and our record speaks to that.

    Question. In April 2021, the State Department invited organizations 
to compete for funding to support projects that promote and defend 
atheism around the world. According to the State Department's official 
announcement, its ``goal is to ensure everyone enjoys religious 
freedom, including freedom to dissent from religious belief and to not 
practice or adhere to a religion.'' The announcement described a 
competitive process for awarding grants of $500,000 to organizations 
committed to specifically to the practice and spread of atheism and 
humanism in South and Central Asia and in the Middle East and North 
Africa (excluding Libya, Syria, and Yemen). Did the bureau of 
Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) receive an official opinion 
letter or memorandum from the Office of the Legal Advisor (L) 
confirming that the proposed grants are constitutional?

    Answer. I am firmly committed to defending the right to freedom of 
religion or belief for all. Consistent with the Biden administration's 
mandate under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as 
amended, this policy applies equally to people of any religion or 
belief, including atheists, agnostics, humanists, or non-theists. 
Consistent with the First Amendment, Department of State programs never 
promote specific religious beliefs; rather, they promote the ability of 
all individuals to have or adopt the religion or beliefs of their 
choice, free from discrimination and violence.

    Question. What specific U.S. foreign policy interests does this 
program advance?

    Answer. As noted in the annual International Religious Freedom 
reports, the prevalence of abuses or discrimination against members of 
one minority group is often indicative of the existence of similar 
discrimination and abuses against members of other minorities. 
Supporting efforts to safeguard the rights of members of one persecuted 
group helps address broader abuses and restrictions experienced by 
members of many or all religious groups in that society.

    Question. Which implementing partners, if any, were chosen for 
funding after the NOFO in April 2021?

    Answer. In accordance with longstanding practice, and to protect 
the ability of rights advocacy organizations to accomplish their 
objectives in highly sensitive international settings, the Department 
does not make public the results of these grant awards. However, the 
Department offers briefings for Congress to discuss these awards when 
requested.

                                 ______
                                 
               Questions Submitted by Senator Marco Rubio
    Question. General Secretary Xi Jinping is correctly regarded as the 
most ideological Chinese Communist Party leader since Mao Zedong. He 
has personally tasked the Party with ``liberating all of humanity'' and 
serving as the ``gravediggers of capitalism.'' He is pushing the 
People's Liberation Army (PLA) to focus its efforts on countering the 
``powerful enemy adversary,'' which the bipartisan U.S.-China Economic 
and Security Review Commission argues is a code word for the U.S. Do 
you believe General Secretary Xi when he says he wants the Party to 
serve as a ``gravedigger of capitalism?''

    Answer. The PRC is the only country with both the intent to reshape 
the international order and, increasingly, the power to do it. The 
PRC's own modernization benefitted from the stability and opportunity 
that the international order provides. But rather than using its power 
to reinforce and revitalize the laws, agreements, principles, and 
institutions that enabled its success, Beijing is undermining them. The 
PRC has become more repressive at home and more aggressive abroad. We 
continue to work with allies and partners to shape the strategic 
environment around Beijing to advance our vision of an open and 
inclusive international system.

    Question. Do you think General Secretary Xi is a partner the U.S. 
can trust?

    Answer. Under President Xi, the Chinese Communist Party has become 
more repressive at home and more aggressive abroad in challenging the 
rules--based international order. We will continue to defend U.S. 
interests, our values, and our affirmative vision for the world. At the 
same time, we recognize that how the United States and PRC manage our 
relationship has consequences for the entire world. That is why we will 
continue to explore possible efforts to partner with the PRC on 
transnational challenges, such as climate change, counternarcotics, 
non-proliferation, and global health.

    Question. At what point will the administration stop downplaying 
Chinese support for Russia ``as a marriage of convenience'' and instead 
denounce the Chinese Communist Party as working against our interests 
in Ukraine?

    Answer. Under President Xi, the Chinese Communist Party has become 
more repressive at home and more aggressive abroad. We will defend U.S. 
national security and advance our values and prosperity. We have 
repeatedly warned the PRC that assistance to Russia's war effort, 
including help evading sanctions, would have serious consequences, and 
have sanctioned or designed PRC entities that have aided Russia's war.

    Question. You say we need to counter Beijing's actions with 
diplomacy. Your department has supplanted or conflated national 
security objectives with progressive social policy by funding a 
Colombian LGBTQI group supporting prostitution, a film festival 
featuring incest and pedophilia in Portugal, and producing a diversity, 
equity, and inclusion declaration with Canada and Mexico while the 
immigration crisis rages at the border. How much of the $4 billion you 
have requested for the Indo-Pacific to achieve national security 
objectives is going to be used on woke projects?

    Answer. The fiscal year 2024 President's budget requests resources 
to out-compete the PRC and advance American prosperity globally. The 
budget includes $2.3 billion in discretionary funding to support 
implementation of the Indo-Pacific Strategy, including by strengthening 
our alliances and partnerships, as well as $2 billion in mandatory 
funding to make game-changing investments in the Indo-Pacific to 
strengthen economies and support our partners in pushing back against 
coercive PRC efforts.

    Question. Will you guarantee to this committee, and the American 
people, the proposed funding for the Indo-Pacific will be utilized to 
advance American prosperity and national security and not on a 
progressive social agenda?

    Answer. The proposed funding for the Indo-Pacific, both the 
mandatory and discretionary components, included in the fiscal year 
2024 President's budget request will advance American prosperity and 
national security. This funding is a critical investment that must be 
made for the United States to advance relationships with partners in 
the Indo-Pacific where competition with the PRC is most pronounced.

    Question. The claim that the United States ``does not seek to 
change China's system'' is especially wrongheaded and far from a slip-
up. It echoes a line in the Biden administration's February Indo-
Pacific strategy: ``Our objective is not to change the PRC but to shape 
the strategic environment in which it operates.'' This sounds exactly 
like the defeatism that I feared when I warned in November 2020 that 
Biden would bring back the ``caretakers of American decline.'' 
Additionally, recent reports of Chinese companies supplying Russian 
companies with body armor, rifle ammunition, and jet repair parts to 
Russia have come to light. What exactly does winning look like in a 
``strategic competition'' if China's political system--a system that 
commits genocide, that covers up the origins of COVID-19, and that 
systematically steals our intellectual property and technology--does 
not change?

    Answer. The PRC is the only country with both the intent to reshape 
the international order and, increasingly, the power to do it. The 
United States will compete and unapologetically stand up for our values 
and interests, but we do not want conflict with the PRC and are not 
seeking a new Cold War. We will vigorously defend and strengthen our 
national security as well as the international law, institutions, and 
agreements that protect the rights of individuals and sovereign 
nations, and maintain the peace and security that makes it possible for 
all countries to coexist.

    Question. How can U.S. leadership be maintained unless our 
worldview continues to shape the global order, and the Party's 
worldview--what it calls ``Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese 
Characteristics for a New Era''--is tossed onto the ash heap of history 
where it belongs?

    Answer. The PRC is the greatest geopolitical challenge facing the 
United States because it is the only competitor with the intent and, 
increasingly, the capability to remake the international order. The 
United States will continue to compete vigorously with the PRC to 
defend our values and vision of the world. At the same time, as we have 
said, we do not seek conflict with the PRC. The United States will 
manage competition responsibly and maintain open lines of communication 
with the PRC.

    Question. How can we paper over General Secretary Xi's statements 
that he wants the Chinese Communist Party to ``liberate all of 
humanity'' and serve as the ``gravediggers of capitalism'' as just a 
difference of opinion that can be constrained?

    Answer. The PRC is the greatest geopolitical challenge facing the 
United States because it is the only competitor with the intent and, 
increasingly, the capability to remake the international order. The PRC 
is more repressive at home and aggressive abroad in challenging the 
interests and values of the United States and our allies and partners. 
We will continue to advance our vision for an open and inclusive 
international system. The United States will also manage competition 
responsibly and maintain open lines of communication with the PRC.

    Question. Why is this administration so prone to timidity when 
confronted by what is nothing less than an existential threat?

    Answer. The Biden administration will continue to compete 
vigorously with the PRC to uphold our values and advance our interests 
and our affirmative vision of the world.We have introduced a record-
setting number of sanctions, export controls, and other competitive 
actions. For example, we added more than 200 PRC and Hong Kong entities 
to the Entity List; pushed back publicly against PRC claims in the 
South China Sea; held the PRC to account for its egregious abuses of 
human rights; and demonstrated unprecedented support for human rights 
and religious freedom in Tibet.

    Question. When will the administration impose sanctions on Chinese 
support for the invasion of Ukraine?

    Answer. We have already sanctioned a number of PRC firms under our 
Russia sanctions regime, including Spacety for providing synthetic 
aperture radar satellite imagery over locations in Ukraine. In my 
meeting with PRC Director Wang Yi on the margins of the Munich Security 
Conference on February 18, I reinforced our concern and potential 
repercussions of the PRC materially supporting Russia's war effort. We 
have made it clear to the PRC there would be real consequences to our 
relationship if the PRC were to provide Russia lethal assistance or 
systematic support to evade sanctions. We will continue to monitor this 
issue very closely.

    Question. What is the administration doing to hold the Chinese 
Communist Party accountable for its continued refusal to stop the 
production of fentanyl precursor chemicals?

    Answer. The Department continues to press Beijing and expand 
efforts to strengthen international cooperation with the PRC and other 
partners to stop the criminal diversion of unscheduled chemicals to 
illicit synthetic drug production. Among other efforts, the Department 
provides foreign policy guidance to the Department of the Treasury in 
support of designations pursuant to the Kingpin Act and E.O. 14059 and 
continually evaluates potential targets for the Department of State 
Transnational Organized Crime and Narcotics Rewards Programs.

    Question. I remain skeptical that you traveling to Beijing is a net 
positive for our Nation given the brazen violation of U.S. sovereignty 
by its spy balloon, the CCP's continued detention of U.S. citizens, and 
ongoing acts of genocide, to name a few. Should it be rescheduled, this 
administration would be perceived as bailing out General Secretary Xi 
Jinping, providing him with an audience after China's ``two sessions,'' 
which have confirmed his consolidation over the Party and Chinese 
society. Do you still plan to visit Beijing?

    Answer. I am prepared to visit Beijing when conditions allow. If I 
do so, I will carry a clear message, as I always do in my engagements 
with PRC leaders, that Beijing must live up to its responsibilities as 
a global power. We will continue to manage this relationship 
responsibly and maintain open lines of communication.

    Question. Under what conditions do you think a trip is appropriate?

    Answer. We will assess the most opportune time to visit to advance 
U.S. interests. From the U.S. perspective, it's important that the PRC 
make meaningful progress on some of the most high-priority issues as 
outlined by President Biden. During any meeting with PRC leaders, I 
intend to carry a clear message, as I always do in my engagements, that 
Beijing must live up to its responsibilities as a global power.

    Question. Would you, at a minimum, require the release of American 
citizens, like Mark Swidan, Zhou Deyong, and Harrison Li, as a 
prerequisite for any meeting with your counterparts in Beijing? Why or 
why not?

    Answer. I am deeply concerned by the PRC's continued use of 
wrongful detentions and coercive exit bans without a fair and 
transparent process in U.S. citizens' cases. There is no higher 
priority for the U.S. government. The administration raises individual 
U.S. citizen cases with the PRC government at every opportunity and at 
the highest levels. We call on the PRC to immediately release 
wrongfully detained individuals, lift coercive travel restrictions on 
U.S. citizens, and refrain from such measures in the future. I commit 
to keeping Congress informed, consistent with privacy concerns.

    Question. Will you raise the issue of the PRC's systematic arrests 
and detentions of the family members of American citizens of Uyghur 
descent in order to silence their advocacy? For example, the families 
of Nury Turkel, the Chairman of the U.S. Commission on International 
Religious Freedom, Gulchehra Hoja, a reporter at Radio Free Asia, and 
Rushan Abbas, a prominent NGO leader, are all either under detention or 
travel bans.

    Answer. I am deeply concerned by ongoing reports of PRC attempting 
to silence human rights advocates in the United States by retaliating 
against their relatives in China. We continue to call for the immediate 
and unconditional release of PRC nationals who are unjustly detained. 
We also urge the PRC to lift coercive exit bans affecting family 
members of U.S. citizens. The Department raises priority cases of 
concern directly with the PRC government at the highest levels, 
including cases concerning relatives of U.S. citizens and residents.

    Question. Do you pledge to hold the Chinese Communist Party 
accountable for its use of slave labor, unfair trade practices, and 
aggression in the region?

    Answer. We will continue to take strong action to counter PRC human 
rights abuses and unfair trade practices. To this end, we have deployed 
tools to promote accountability for PRC individuals and entities 
responsible for human rights abuses. While we were disappointed with 
the outcome of the 2022 Human Rights Council vote not to discuss 
Xinjiang, it successfully made clear the PRC is not above scrutiny. We 
are working with likeminded allies on next steps to promote 
accountability for the PRC's human rights abuses and unfair trade 
practices, and to uphold the rules-based international order.

    Question. Since the start of the Biden administration, it appears 
its China policy has been flawed. On the one hand, the Biden 
administration says Beijing is the only regime that has the intention 
and capacity to reshape the international order. On the other hand, the 
administration still insists on cooperating with the Chinese government 
where ``our interests align.'' For example, John Kerry is still 
championing a climate deal, even though the number of Chinese coal 
plants continues to rise and Beijing eagerly buys up Iranian and 
Russian oil. Do you believe a government that routinely violates its 
commitments to international agreements, and has no interest in slowing 
down its industrial capacity, will negotiate with us in good faith?

    Answer. The Biden administration holds the PRC accountable to its 
bilateral and international commitments. We do not hesitate to call out 
the PRC when it has failed to uphold these commitments, such as in the 
most recent Annual Report on China's WTO Compliance. As the largest 
carbon dioxide emitter, the PRC must accelerate efforts to limit global 
temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C. Confronting the climate crisis is a 
global and existential issue. The world expects China and the United 
States to work together when it comes to transnational challenges such 
as climate, including on energy transition, methane emission 
reductions, and ending illegal deforestation.

    Question. What do you base that belief on?

    Answer. The Biden administration holds the PRC accountable to its 
bilateral and international commitments. We do not hesitate to call out 
the PRC when it has failed to uphold these commitments, such as in the 
most recent Annual Report on China's WTO Compliance. As the largest 
carbon dioxide emitter, the PRC must accelerate efforts to limit global 
temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C. Confronting the climate crisis is a 
global and existential issue. The world expects China and the United 
States to work together when it comes to transnational challenges such 
as climate, including on energy transition, methane emission 
reductions, and ending illegal deforestation.

    Question. A few months ago, a report by the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies concluded that the war in Ukraine has 
severely depleted both American and European stocks of munitions 
critical for a conventional war. This is especially cause for concern 
given that the Chinese Communist Party is stepping up its aggressive 
behavior in the Indo-Pacific, including towards Taiwan and India. It is 
my belief that deterring Beijing in the region must be the top priority 
for the U.S., and our assistance to Ukraine--though important--should 
not come at the cost of leaving us unprepared to deter China or degrade 
the ability of the U.S. to defend ourselves at home. Have the 
militaries of Taiwan, or our other allies and partners in the Indo-
Pacific region, requested any of the capabilities and equipment we are 
providing Ukraine?

    Answer. Support to Ukraine and support to Taiwan and our other 
allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific are not mutually exclusive. It 
is correct that there are similarities and differences to our partners' 
defense needs, and capabilities provided to a particular customer are 
often the same systems that enhance the capabilities of other partners 
and allies. Many of the capabilities we have provided Ukraine via the 
drawdown authority are similar to capabilities that would support 
Taiwan's defense requirements, though these often include different 
variants to systems our Indo-Pacific partners are procuring through 
Foreign Military Sales.

    Question. If so, how is the department handling competing Foreign 
Military Sales requests between our Indo-Pacific allies and partners 
and our European allies? Which is being prioritized for fulfillment?

    Answer. Numerous factors determine the production queue, including 
the order in which customers finalize and fund contracts, current DoD 
requirements, and the system and specific variant ordered. Prioritizing 
one partner would result in significant cost increases to that partner 
and likely cause the United States to miss contractual obligations with 
other partners. That said, we are looking at ways to prioritize urgent 
needs for our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific and Europe.

    Question. Chinese-produced fentanyl and fentanyl precursors 
continue to enter the U.S. illicitly and kill American adults and 
children. It is a tragedy that many of Florida's, and America's, 
families are all too familiar with. Despite this, last fall, the Biden 
administration did not list China as a Major Drug Transit or Major 
Illicit Drug Producing Country for Fiscal Year 2023. This is an insult 
to the pain and suffering so many Americans are facing due to Chinese-
produced fentanyl and fentanyl precursors. The law is clear: any 
country ``that is a significant direct source of covered synthetic 
drugs or psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances, including 
precursor chemicals when those chemicals are used in the production of 
such drugs and substances, significantly affecting the United States'' 
should be designated. China clearly meets that definition. Why did you 
leave it off the list?

    Answer. The James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for 
fiscal year 2023 amended the definition of Major Drug and Major Illicit 
Drug Producing Countries to include synthetic drugs and precursor 
chemicals. It was enacted into law by President Biden on December 23, 
2022. This legislative change occurred following President Biden's last 
determination identifying Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug 
Producing Countries for fiscal year 2023 in September 2022. The fiscal 
year 2024 determination of countries is required under law by September 
15, 2023.

    Question. Has the department considered sanctioning Chinese persons 
and entities involved with producing fentanyl and fentanyl precursors 
through the Kingpin Act? If not, why?

    Answer. The Department of State provides foreign policy guidance to 
the Department of the Treasury in support of designations pursuant to 
the Kingpin Act and the more recent Executive Order 14059. The 
Department remains committed to continued close collaboration in 
support of the Kingpin Act and other sanctions programs targeting the 
fentanyl supply chain. For further specifics on potential targets, I 
recommend questions be directed to the Department of the Treasury.

    Question. Which threshold needs to be crossed in order for the 
department to use tools currently available to sanction these foreign 
persons and entities?

    Answer. The Department utilizes available sanctions tools 
consistent with the terms of the specific authorities being used. The 
Department works with the Department of the Treasury to support the 
implementation of relevant sanctions, including EO 14059, which 
implements the fentanyl sanctions act, and the Foreign Narcotics 
Kingpin Designation Act. For specifics on further implementation 
details, I refer you to the Department of the Treasury.

    Question. On February 27, pursuant to Congress' enactment of the No 
TikTok on Government Devices Act, the Biden administration ordered a 
ban on TikTok on most government devices in 30 days, which would be 
March 30. Do you agree that TikTok represents a national security 
threat to the United States?

    Answer. Since July 2021, the State Department prohibits the use of 
TikTok on Department-owned devices and the creation of official 
Department of State TikTok accounts. In addition, our policy states 
that U.S. Embassies and Consulates should not hire contractors nor 
third-party vendors to create or manage TikTok accounts of behalf of 
Department organizations and personnel.

    Question. Do you agree that TikTok should not be installed on U.S. 
government devices?

    Answer. The State Department has prohibited the use of TikTok on 
Department-owned devices since July 2021 and has prohibited the 
creation of official Department of State TikTok accounts. Additionally, 
we are working to ensure compliance with the February 2023 OMB 
memorandum ``No TikTok on Government Devices'' Implementation Guidance.

    Question. Why is the Biden administration showcasing TikTok 
influencers instead of clearly articulating the national security 
threat the app poses to U.S. citizens?

    Answer. The Department does not manage any TikTok accounts and is 
taking necessary measures to safeguard government infrastructure and 
data. The Department, however, is committed to engaging global 
audiences, including meeting young people where they are, and promoting 
U.S. foreign policy while ensuring we do not cede this space to our 
adversaries and competitors. Methods used may include collaboration 
with individuals on platforms where we do not currently have a digital 
presence.

    Question. Your fiscal year 2024 budget request identifies two 
budget and policy priorities in the top three, and they are the 
implementation of an Indo-Pacific strategy to strengthen alliances and 
partnerships and out-compete the CCP by providing alternatives to the 
CCP's predatory and coercive practices and has requested $4 billion for 
this national security priority. However, you have requested $6.4 
billion for what can only be called pet social policy projects that 
only a narrow section of American society support, such as LGBTQI 
advocacy initiatives, the U.N. Green Climate Fund, a Clean Technology 
Fund, and Family Planning and Reproductive Health--essentially abortion 
advocacy. This disparity highlights where the administration's 
priorities truly are, progressive social policy over American 
prosperity and stated national security priorities. This 
administration's obsession with promoting a woke agenda is destructive 
in its own right, but even more so when placed in the context of great 
power competition. Currently, your department has more than 100 vacant 
and unfilled Foreign Service Generalist and Specialist positions in the 
Indo-Pacific. How many Foreign and Civil service staff are employed in 
the Diversity offices of State and USAID?

    Answer. The Department's Office of Diversity and Inclusion 
currently has authorization for 12 full-time equivalent (FTE) 
positions. One Senior Leader position will be added in fiscal year 
2023. USAID's Office of the Chief DEIA Officer currently has 10 FTE 
positions: eight Civil Service staff and two Foreign Service staff.

    Question. In your proposed budget request, you have proposed 56 new 
positions for State in the Indo-Pacific. Why should Congress authorize 
additional positions when you cannot fill current positions and when 
the department fills Diversity offices ahead of staffing a region the 
President and yourself have stated is the priority?

    Answer. The Department continues to make hiring and filling 
positions a top priority. In fiscal year 2022, the Department executed 
the largest intake of Foreign Service professionals in a decade and 
fiscal year 2023 numbers will be even larger. We remain committed to 
protecting and promoting U.S. interests, including in the Indo-Pacific, 
by ensuring the Department is staffed appropriately.

    Question. The administration's fiscal year 2024 budget request 
includes $532.1 million for the Western Hemisphere. This request 
supports many initiatives for the security of the Caribbean, including 
the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), to help fight crime and 
violence in these nations. Senator Kaine and I introduced legislation 
to codify the CBSI to require the State Department to promote 
cooperation with Caribbean nations and address the crisis in Haiti, 
which isn't a beneficiary country. What steps has the State Department 
taken to address the ongoing security crisis in Haiti?

    Answer. The Department provided over $90 million since July 2021 to 
help the Haitian National Police (HNP) expand its anti-gang capacity by 
training, equipping, and vetting specialized units and supporting 
community policing programs. The Department worked with U.S. and 
Canadian militaries to expeditiously deliver Haitian-purchased armored 
vehicles and provide real-time advice so the HNP could retake the 
Varreux fuel terminal from the gangs in November 2022. The Department's 
CBSI programs address firearms trafficking and other regional problems 
that affect Haiti.

    Question. Why hasn't the administration submitted a resolution to 
the United Nations Security Council calling for international support 
for Haiti, which Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield promised last 
October?

    Answer. As a result of U.S. advocacy, the UN Security Council 
adopted a resolution that extended the mandate of the UN Integrated 
Office in Haiti (BINUH) to 1 year, increased the number of police 
advisors, dedicated capacity to address sexual and gender-based 
violence in BINUH's human rights unit, and established the first UN 
sanctions regime ever in the Western Hemisphere. In addition to 
increasing our bilateral assistance to the Haitian National Police, we 
continue our intensive diplomatic outreach to identify partners to lead 
a non-UN multinational force (MNF).

    Question. What is the status on identifying a country to lead an 
international response to the Haitian government's October 2022 request 
for help?

    Answer. We continue to evaluate options and work with international 
partners to respond to Haiti's request for an international security 
force. In addition, the Department is intensifying its efforts to 
support the Haitian National Police (HNP), including through increased 
training and equipment.

    Question. How many Haitian migrants have to undertake the dangerous 
journey from Haiti to Florida and across the southern U.S. border 
before the administration takes the initiative in quelling gang 
violence in Haiti?

    Answer. The administration remains deeply concerned about Haiti's 
gang violence and irregular migration. Since July 2021, we have 
provided over $90 million for Haitian National Police anti-gang 
capacity building. We continue to lead measures to promote an end to 
the violence, including imposing sanctions and visa restrictions on 
over 50 individuals involved in corruption and criminal organizations 
since October 2022. The Department supports safe, orderly, and humane 
migration from Haiti and the region, including through the expanded 
parole process launched in January 2023.

    Question. The President's request includes $430 million to support 
hemispheric migration management and proposes additional funding for 
programs aimed at improving the lives of migrants and refugees, 
including an allocation for the Inter-American Development Bank's fund 
to invest in the private sector in the Western Hemisphere, which would 
help these economies provide opportunities to their people and keep 
them from migrating here. What guardrails are in place to prevent 
Beijing-controlled companies from accessing these funds?

    Answer. Companies domiciled in the People's Republic of China, as a 
non-borrowing member of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), are 
eligible to bid on projects under IDB financing. The United States 
continues to advocate for reforms and procurement policies at the 
multilateral development banks (MDBs) that focus more on the best value 
for life-cycle costs, which showcases U.S.-based firms' strengths, 
rather than lowest bids. I refer you to the U.S. Treasury Department, 
the lead agency for the MDBs, for more detailed questions on MDB 
procurement.

    Question. In addition to funding supported by the bank, how else 
are we supporting U.S. private investment in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, including upper-middle-income and high-income countries that 
are not eligible for DFC funding?

    Answer. DFC is authorized to work in upper-middle-income countries 
on projects that advance infrastructure, human needs, and USAID 
priorities. EXIM, which operates without income restriction, and USTDA, 
which can work in countries up to middle-income, are able to facilitate 
U.S. exports and private investment throughout the region. We are 
implementing the Blue Dot Network initiative to certify quality 
infrastructure projects and help close the infrastructure gap around 
the world by attracting greater private sector investment regardless of 
income level.

    Question. On October 7, 2022, the UN Human Rights Council voted to 
adopt a U.S.-supported resolution renewing the mandate of the UN Fact-
Finding Mission on Venezuela. Prior to the Council's vote, the mission 
released a report which concluded that ``Nicolas Maduro, supported by 
other high-level authorities, stand out as the main architects in the 
design, implementation and maintenance of a machinery with the purpose 
of repressing dissent.'' How is the State Department supporting efforts 
to hold the Maduro regime accountable for their systematic violations 
of human rights, as documented by the UN Fact Finding mission?

    Answer. The State Department continues to hold the Maduro regime 
accountable for its human rights abuses, including those documented in 
the UN Fact Finding Mission (FFM). As part of these efforts, the U.S. 
Government supports democratic actors, including civil society and the 
opposition, coordinating with democratic countries to demand democracy 
and call out the regime's violations. We have also welcomed the 
International Criminal Court`s investigation into abuses, supported the 
UN FFM's mandate renewal, and imposed sanctions on the Maduro regime.

    Question. Is the administration considering a prisoner exchange 
involving Alex Saab, who is wanted for counter-terrorism charges, for 
innocent Americans who are wrongly detained in Venezuela?

    Answer. The Biden-Harris administration has made it a priority to 
protect Americans abroad and bring home all U.S. nationals wrongfully 
detained or held hostage abroad. We, as always, do not comment on the 
specifics of any particular ongoing case.

    Question. Following the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) vote in 
October, Venezuela lost its seat on the Council, and was replaced by 
Costa Rica--a democracy with a good human rights record. This was a 
positive development for the Council and the international community's 
rejection of the Maduro regime's human rights record. How can we apply 
the same support to keep other countries with human rights violations 
off of the Council in the future?

    Answer. The United States continues to seek reforms of the UN Human 
Rights Council (HRC), particularly with respect to its membership. The 
United States actively engages with allies and partners to encourage 
countries with good human rights records to challenge countries with 
poor records for seats on the Council. The United States also presses 
member states to more carefully consider human rights records of 
countries running for HRC election.

    Question. The human rights situation in Nicaragua has deteriorated 
significantly in recent years. The Daniel Ortega regime has suppressed 
dissent, shuttered independent media, arbitrarily detained political 
opponents, and carried out fraudulent presidential elections. U.S. law, 
specifically the RENACER Act, requires the Secretary of State to impose 
sanctions against human rights violators and those obstructing the 
establishment of conditions that advances free, fair, transparent and 
democratic elections in Nicaragua. What actions have you taken to 
advance democratic elections in Nicaragua, as stated in the RENACER 
Act?

    Answer. The Ortega-Murillo regime continues to trample democratic 
institutions and block democracy's return to Nicaragua. The United 
States has imposed financial sanctions on 48 individuals and 11 
entities and has taken steps to place visa restrictions on nearly 1,000 
Nicaraguans and their family members who fuel repression and 
corruption. No member of the Nicaraguan government nor anyone who 
facilitates the Ortega-Murillo regime's abuses should believe they can 
travel freely to the United States or avoid accountability for their 
actions.

    Question. How is the State Department highlighting the human rights 
situation in Nicaragua at the UNHRC and other international forums?

    Answer. The Department of State works with allies and partners in 
international fora, including the UNHRC and the OAS, to focus global 
attention on the Ortega-Murillo regime's human rights abuses. On April 
3, the UNHRC adopted a U.S.-cosponsored resolution on Nicaragua and 
renewed the mandate of the Group of Human Rights Experts on Nicaragua 
for an additional 2 years. On March 29, U.S. Ambassador Mora 
highlighted former political prisoner Tamara Davila's testimony before 
the OAS Permanent Council, reminding everyone what is at stake in 
Nicaragua.

    Question. A few weeks ago, several Nicaraguan officials visited the 
United States for the World Baseball Classic. The Nicaraguan community 
in Florida identified some of these officials as members of the 
Nicaraguan National Police, which is subject to visa sanctions mandated 
by the NICA and RENACER Acts. Can you confirm if those officials are 
members of the Nicaraguan National Police, which the U.S. has found 
responsible for numerous cases of human rights abuses in Nicaragua, 
issued visas to enter the country?

    Answer. Visa records are confidential under U.S. law and therefore 
we cannot provide details on individual visa cases. The Department has 
taken steps to impose visa restrictions on nearly 1,000 Nicaraguans who 
have contributed to the regime's human rights abuses and actions to 
undermine democracy. The Department continues to gather information and 
review visa applications to identify individuals covered by the 
sanctions described in the NICA and RENACER Act, as well as those 
ineligible under other visa restriction authorities.

    Question. When should we expect the next announcement of sanctions 
on Nicaragua?

    Answer. We do not preview sanctions actions. U.S. sanctions are 
designed to encourage the regime to change course. As the regime has 
not yet shown willingness to do so, we continue to explore additional 
coordinated, multilateral pressure using the diplomatic and economic 
tools at our disposal.

    Question. Last month, officials from Cuba's Ministry of the 
Interior, an entity under U.S. human rights sanctions, were invited to 
visit the U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters and a Coast Guard facility in 
North Carolina. Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism. It has sponsored 
terrorism for years in South America, and it continues to shield 
criminals responsible for horrific attacks on U.S. citizens from the 
reach of our judicial system. Do you agree that Cuba should remain on 
the list of state sponsors of terrorism?

    Answer. The Department of State designated Cuba as an SST on 
January 12, 2021, for repeatedly providing support for acts of 
international terrorism. Under U.S. law, specific statutory criteria 
must be met to rescind SST designations. The Department carefully 
reviews available information, from many sources, to determine if a 
country meets the statutory criteria for designation or rescission. Any 
review of Cuba's SST designation would be based on the law, including 
the criteria established by Congress.

    Question. Are you aware of any other program where we invite North 
Korea, Iran, or Syria, the other designated state sponsors of 
terrorism, to tour our military facilities?

    Answer. The Departments of State and Homeland Security, including 
the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), jointly planned the Cuba Port Security 
visit in support of the USCG International Port Security (IPS) 
Program's mission. The IPS Program fulfills the mandate to protect the 
U.S. Maritime Transportation System (MTS) through security assessments 
of international ports. The USCG IPS Program has not invited North 
Korea, Iran, or Syria to tour port facilities in the U.S. or USCG 
units. I refer you to the Department of Defense for any questions 
regarding visits to military facilities.

    Question. A few weeks ago, Senator Menendez and I sent a letter 
urging you to increase efforts to stop the expansion or resumption of 
programs in Latin America that makes use of Cuba's foreign medical 
missions. I was pleased to see in the recent release of the annual 
human rights report that the department again pointed out these 
missions as a form of forced labor and noted that it's more than just 
doctors. The regime is forcing sailors, athletes, musicians, 
architects, and teachers into forced labor programs abroad. What is the 
Department doing to encourage countries like Mexico, Brazil, and 
Colombia to stop from using Cuban medical missions?

    Answer. The administration seeks every opportunity to bring abuses 
in Cuba's labor export program to light, raising our concerns with 
senior foreign officials around the world. In recent weeks, U.S. 
embassies engaged officials in Mexico and Brazil to share our concerns 
with Cuba's labor export program to mitigate exploitation and 
trafficking of government-affiliated Cuban workers, and we will 
continue to raise this important issue. The Department has documented 
strong indicators of forced labor in Cuba's labor export program in 
each annual Trafficking in Persons Report since 2010.

    Question. Should these countries start using Cuban Medical 
Missions, what will be the U.S. response?

    Answer. The Department will continue to raise concerns regarding 
forced labor in Cuba's labor export programs with international 
partners and in multilateral fora. We will urge countries to 
proactively screen government-affiliated Cuban workers for trafficking 
and forced labor indicators, protect identified victims, seek 
transparency on their contractual agreements, and respect their human 
rights and labor rights. The Department continues to call on other 
governments to curb coercive labor practices and ensure compliance with 
international labor standards.

    Question. Since assuming office, the new administration of Gustavo 
Petro has embarked on an ambitious ``Paz Total'' or ``Total Peace'' 
plan by launching negotiations with dozens of armed groups. These are 
quite different from the talks launched in previous years with the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)--many of the groups 
participating in Paz Total, like Clan de Golfo, are literally just drug 
cartels with no other motive than the pursuit of profit. Is Colombia's 
pursuit of Paz Total with drug cartels beneficial for the safety of 
Americans?

    Answer. While the outcome of the Petro administration's 
conversations with criminal groups is uncertain and there is much 
skepticism that ``Total Peace'' is achievable, if talks lead to those 
groups disbanding and giving up drug trafficking and other criminal 
activities, the safety and well-being of U.S. citizens should improve. 
The level of violence within Colombia would presumably decrease and, so 
long as other groups do not step in to fill the void, negotiated 
agreements could result in a decrease in Colombian cocaine trafficked 
to the United States.

    Question. Has the Department raised concerns with the Petro 
administration regarding participants in the Paz Total talks?

    Answer. Yes. We have urged extreme caution in dealing with 
terrorists and narcotraffickers, especially those who seek concessions 
to allow them to continue criminal operations and seek impunity. While 
we support the pursuit of peace in Colombia and President Petro's 
desire to address ongoing threats from insurgent, terrorist, and drug 
trafficking groups, our goal remains to bring drug traffickers and 
terrorists who violate U.S. laws to justice, to avoid impunity for 
serious crime, and to reduce coca cultivation, and drug production and 
trafficking.

    Question. Do you anticipate that Colombia will not honor its 
extradition treaty obligations with the United States, as some Paz 
Total participants are demanding as part of the talks?

    Answer. To date, President Petro has not denied a single U.S. 
extradition request and approved almost 40 extraditions. We expect to 
work with Colombia to ensure that extraditions continue, to advance our 
shared law enforcement goals.

    Question. My office has received multiple requests from U.S. 
citizens whose family members are waiting for approval for their visas 
to legally travel to the United States. Since the start of the 
pandemic, the consular backlog has been a constant source of 
frustration for my constituents. What steps has the administration 
taken to alleviate this backlog of cases?

    Answer. We are focused on getting posts back to pre-pandemic 
staffing levels to eliminate immigrant visa backlogs and reduce 
nonimmigrant visa interview appointment wait times. As scheduling 
capacity at posts has increased, the National Visa Center forwards 
interview-ready-cases; posts have reduced IV scheduling backlogs by 27 
percent since July 2021. The Department uses data-driven analyses to 
help posts adjudicate visas more efficiently, schedule more applicants, 
and develop backlog-elimination plans for the posts with the largest 
pandemic-driven backlogs.

    Question. What explains the continued delay in resolving the 
backlog?

    Answer. The Department is focused on eliminating the backlog of 
interview-ready immigrant visa cases that accrued during the pandemic. 
The National Visa Center continues to schedule as many interviews as 
posts' capacities allow. The Department has dedicated significant 
resources to rebuild staffing and reduce visa backlogs and appointment 
wait times. We are focused on helping all our posts around the world 
get the tools, resources, and support they need to bring wait times 
down. We continue to see significant progress in 2023.

    Question. Honduras recently cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan 
and officially established diplomatic relations with the People's 
Republic of China. V This means that yet another country in our region 
turns its back to our democratic ally, despite Taiwan's years long 
support for development in Honduras. Earlier this year, Taiwan launched 
an education program in Honduras under the Global Cooperation and 
Training Framework jointly administered with the United States. What's 
the administration reaction to this concerning news?

    Answer. Countries make their own sovereign decisions in their 
international relationships. However, countries often find promises 
exchanged for diplomatic recognition go unfulfilled. The U.S. one-China 
policy remains unchanged. Taiwan's investments in Honduras reflected 
its lasting and sustainable commitment to the prosperity of the 
Honduran people. Taiwan is a reliable, likeminded, and democratic 
partner and all who value democracy, good governance, transparency, the 
rule of law, and economic prosperity for their people should seek to 
expand engagement with Taiwan.

    Question. How is the administration demonstrating the detrimental 
effect of this decision on Honduras?

    Answer. Special Presidential Advisor for the Americas Chris Dodd 
spoke with President Castro on March 20, and U.S. Embassy Tegucigalpa 
has carried out sustained engagement to express our concern over the 
Honduran government's decision. U.S. diplomats explained the risks to 
Honduran sovereignty, transparency, accountability, and sustainable 
financing that come with partnership with the PRC. Special Presidential 
Advisor Dodd and the Embassy also underscored the many expected 
benefits from partnership with the PRC that other countries never saw 
come to fruition.

    Question. Why is Honduras invited to participate at the second 
Summit for Democracy, when it continues to mistreat American companies 
and choose to stand with the genocidal regime in Beijing?

    Answer. A Summit invitation does not imply that all aspects of a 
country's democracy are perfect. It shows commitment to partners 
willing to strengthen democratic governance. Honduras held free/fair 
elections in 2021 that led to a peaceful transfer of power. The Castro 
administration continues to express commitment to democratic 
governance. We support companies and investments that promote good 
governance and jobs and will convey our concerns about the PRC's 
troubling trade, environmental, and human rights practices with 
Honduras.
