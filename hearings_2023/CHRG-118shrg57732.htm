 ENHANCING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND CONNECTIVITY IN AIR TRANSPORTATION

                              ----------                              


                        THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
        Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:05 a.m., in 
room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Maria 
Cantwell, Chairwoman of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Cantwell [presiding], Klobuchar, Markey, 
Baldwin, Duckworth, Tester, Hickenlooper, Welch, Cruz, Wicker, 
Schmitt, and Vance.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    The Chair. Good morning, everyone. The U.S. committee on 
Commerce, Science and Transportation will come to order. This 
morning, we are having a hearing on enhancing consumer 
protections and connectivity in air transportation. And we are 
joined by a distinguished group of panelists who we will get to 
in a minute.
    Today we will be discussing the importance of strengthening 
consumer protections, expanding access for travelers and 
commuters across America. The American consumer has had a rough 
flying experience over the last few years. In 2020, the 
Department of Transportation received nearly 30,000 airline 
refund complaints, more than a 4,600 percent increase from 
2019.
    The following year. In 2021 DOT received over 6,600 
complaints. Still nearly a 1,000 percent increase over pre-
pandemic levels. And last November, by 2022, U.S. consumers 
complaints were already 603 percent higher than in November 
2019. And then we had a massive disruption that left nearly 2 
million Southwest Airline passengers delayed or stranded across 
the country.
    In these situations, the U.S. consumer is left with limited 
information, hardly any choices, and very little recourse. In 
this year's FAA reauthorization, I hope we can work together on 
a new passenger bill of rights that gets a better deal for the 
U.S. consumer. Consumers deserve concrete definition of 
significant delays or cancellations of your flight, and they 
deserve a very timely refund.
    We must take down the hurdles to getting your money back 
when you don't receive the service you paid for. Any travel 
credit, if accepted in lieu of a refund, should never expire. 
That is your money and should be in your bank account. We also 
need to have real time, real person communication when a system 
breaks down, like in the Southwest situation.
    That system failure left consumers stranded without any 
information and no one to talk to. In this kind of a massive 
shutdown, we need a better communication system. Second, 
Congress must end unfair and hidden fees known as junk fees. 
That is taking real money out of the pockets of Americans.
    We should force the rebooking fees when your flight was 
canceled or delayed by the airline itself and stop that 
practice. We should make sure that families aren't charged just 
for sitting next to each other at the very beginning of a 
flight when there are many flight options. I look forward to 
hearing from Bill McGee on this issue this morning.
    Many passengers with disabilities, especially those in 
wheelchairs, are cutoff from their families and opportunities 
just because of these issues. Sara Nelson, head of the 
Association of Flight Attendants, and Heather Ansley from 
Paralyzed Veterans of America, will provide more information on 
this topic.
    We also need to address, third, that Congress gave the FAA 
the specific task of establishing what is a minimum seat size 
for airlines. The FAA has failed to take action on this, and 
this committee should help resolve that issue. To make this new 
passenger bill of rights stick, we should formally authorize 
fully fund, and staff up the Department of Transportation's 
Office of Aviation Consumer Protection.
    This makes sense, given the incredible increase in workload 
and surge from consumer complaints. Secretary Buttigieg has 
taken important steps to protect consumers, but we need more 
policemen on the beat to execute these tools. We should 
consider tripling the civil penalties for noncompliance, the 
cost of bad actors and continuing to do things. We must improve 
the consumer experience.
    But today, we also must talk about enabling the rural 
markets and small markets who are trapped because of lack of 
air transportation system. Most economic development happens 
within ten miles of an airport.
    So, if we are hampering our airports, we are hampering our 
economic development. I am proud that Trent Moyers Director of 
airports at the Chelan Douglas Airport Authority, will be with 
us to talk about why Wenatchee, the Apple capital of the world, 
needs to have good air transportation.
    Next to the airport, Microsoft is building a 41,000 square 
foot data center that will employ 50 full time employees. This 
is a $400 million investment that would not be possible without 
the airport connection to the larger Washington economy. So, we 
have to have our communities like Wenatchee thrive, and for 
Wenatchee to thrive, they need good air transportation 
connectivity.
    This committee also needs to deal with this issue and help 
rural America have good air transportation service. With that, 
I will turn it over to the Ranking Member for his opening 
statement. Senator Cruz.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED CRUZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS

    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Before I address the 
topic of today's hearing, I want to take a moment to touch on 
bipartisanship at this committee. I greatly appreciate that 
aviation has traditionally been a bipartisan effort. I think 
that view is held by most, if not all, of the members of this 
committee.
    Every one of us wants safe air travel. We want to board a 
plane and know that you are safe. That the pilots, the air 
traffic controllers, the ground crew are highly qualified 
people who will safely get you and your fellow passengers to 
your destination.
    Because we all hold those basic sentiments about aviation, 
I have to admit, I am disappointed that today's hearing about 
the rights of the flying public is so one sided. We are going 
to hear one perspective about the regulation of airlines. But 
we should be hearing from a much more balanced panel.
    It is my hope at future hearings, including the one planned 
for next week, that we can get back to the spirit of 
bipartisanship that we have had for so many years on this 
committee, with the consensus panel of witnesses presenting a 
balanced view so the Committee can have all the facts.
    If a hearing panel doesn't present a diverse range of 
views, it defeats the purpose of a hearing. You would think 
that a hearing about, ``unfair airline policies'' might include 
an airline. Perhaps we would start with an airline that has the 
single lowest customer satisfaction rating or employs some of 
the distasteful practices being discussed today, such as 
charging customers to talk to a representative on the phone.
    That airline would be Frontier Airlines, whom I invited to 
testify, but Frontier, as well as their trade association, the 
National Air Carriers Association, refused to appear. Consumer 
protection is an important component of the travel experience. 
Travelers every day get on an airplane.
    Some love it, some dread it. I happen to enjoy flying. I do 
it a lot. And I guess that is good because I spend many hours a 
week on a plane, getting to and from work, and traveling the 
great state of Texas. But if something goes wrong with a 
reservation or with the weather, the experience can quickly 
become unpleasant. I understand that frustration firsthand, as 
do millions of Americans.
    Sometimes, airlines miss on customer service, leaving 
travelers stranded, inconvenienced, or otherwise harmed. To try 
and end extremely miserable consequences when things go wrong, 
on multiple occasions, Congress has legislated to protect 
consumers, so they, for instance, are not stuck on a tarmac for 
longer than 2 hours, so that they have easier access to 
customer service, and so that they are compensated if an 
airline overbooks a flight.
    However, when we look at potential legislation in this 
area, we need to be careful not to impose so many Government 
regulations that we make flying more miserable or more costly. 
One group of travelers whose needs we should pay particular 
attention to are those with disabilities.
    Congress recognized that persons with disabilities face 
unique challenges when flying, by including the 2018 FAA 
reauthorization law specific provisions to improve the 
traveling experience. This included granting DOT the authority 
to issue civil penalties against airlines that damage or lose a 
person's wheelchair.
    It is my understanding that 5 years later, the Department 
of Transportation has still not exercised this authority. I am 
grateful that we will have an opportunity to hear today from 
the perspective of the Paralyzed Veterans of America today.
    For PVA's members, flying can prompt fear and anxiety. It 
is not just a simple matter of getting where they need to go. 
Disabled passengers deserve to travel not just safely, but they 
deserve to travel with dignity.
    Another matter of great importance to the flying public is 
connectivity. Too often, communities become disconnected by the 
whims of large airlines. I have seen this happen in Texas, and 
I am sure many of us have with smaller towns in our states.
    One example is what happened in Del Rio, where American 
Airlines is discontinuing service to Del Rio, Texas. I am 
deeply concerned about the impact that action will have on 
residents and local businesses.
    I have raised it directly with senior leadership of the 
airline, and I would like to hear today ideas for how to work 
through these kinds of problems. Finally, a note of caution. 
The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 was, by all indications, a 
significant success. Since deregulation, the price of air 
travel has fallen by more than 30 percent.
    And when there is vigorous competition among airlines, 
offering services on a particular route, services better and 
airfares lower.
    Dr. Clifford Winston, an economist at Brookings 
Institution, testified before this committee last month that 
reregulating airlines would inevitably lead to a cost transfer 
to consumers, raising prices, making family trips too 
unaffordable, and could cause more small communities to lose 
service.
    I know I would have many unhappy constituents if I 
supported any legislation that made air travel more expensive 
and less affordable. So, I hope we will resist the temptation 
to micromanage travel schedules and pricing plans. I would like 
to thank the witnesses for being here to discuss this topic. 
Thank you.
    The Chair. Thank you. I will turn it over to my colleague 
who is going to chair the meeting, the Chair of the 
Subcommittee.
    I will note for the record that Frontier Airlines, 
Allegiant Airlines, the National Air Carrier Association, all 
were invited to testify and had scheduling conflicts. Senator 
Duckworth, thank you again for your leadership on aviation and 
chairing the subcommittee.

              STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY DUCKWORTH, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ILLINOIS

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Madam Chair, and also Ranking 
Member Cruz for holding today's hearing. Our focus is on 
consumer protection issues, but I want to take a moment to 
raise a critical safety issue that at its core is about 
protecting every passenger that flies commercial aviation.
    FAA regulations require that in the event of an emergency, 
passengers can evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds. That is one 
and a half minutes. However, FAA evacuation simulations fail to 
include real life conditions common on commercial flights such 
as a full plane, the presence of carry-on bags, or passengers 
who are children, senior citizens, or persons with 
disabilities.
    This failure to test procedures under real world conditions 
helps explain a 2016 incident at O'Hare International Airport 
when an engine fire on an American Airlines 676 forced an 
aborted takeoff. The crew executed the border takeoff 
flawlessly. However, the evacuation took nearly two and a half 
minutes, far longer than the 90 seconds standard. And there was 
one serious injury and 20 minor ones.
    According to the NTSB, at all three usable exits, there 
were passengers evacuating with carry-on bags despite 
instructions to leave your bags behind. Senator Baldwin and I 
introduced the emergency vacating of aircraft cabin, or EVAC 
Act, to require realistic testing.
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on the 
importance of accurate evacuation simulations. I must also 
express the disability community's deep frustration that our 
aviation system still fails to make sure every passenger with a 
disability is treated with dignity and respect. We have had 
half a century to make flying accessible for the millions of 
Americans with disabilities who travel by air each year.
    Yet flying with a disability remains riddled with 
unnecessary issues that at best are frustrating and cost time 
and money, and at worst are demeaning and inflict harm on our 
customers. Don't get me started on how frequently wheelchairs 
get damaged in transit, a huge problem that I and many others 
experience far too frequently.
    According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, 11,389 
wheelchairs and scooters were mishandled by air carriers in 
2022, up from 7,239 in 2021. Too many air carriers have 
demonstrated that drastically reducing the rate of broken 
wheelchairs and assistive devices is simply not a corporate 
priority.
    And after years of failure, it is time for Congress to act. 
I want to thank Senator Baldwin for her leadership on the Air 
Carrier Access Amendments Act and urge my colleagues to include 
it in the FAA reauthorization. Of course, accessibility 
problems are not limited to after a flight touches down.
    We should empower consumers and airline employees alike 
with easy access to clear information that enables one to 
determine whether a specific flight accommodates a certain 
wheelchair model or mobility aid.
    We must also ensure passengers with disabilities can sit 
with their companions who provide assistance and require 
airports and air carriers and airport websites and mobile apps 
to be fully accessible. It is bad enough that certain carriers 
are making it harder to reach a live customer service agent by 
phone, but for customers that can't use a mouse or touch 
screen, an inaccessible website could leave you literally 
stranded when there are massive delays.
    I am working on legislation that would require the DOT to 
examine air carriers and airport websites and mobile apps to 
determine if they are accessible, and issue civil penalties 
against those that are not.
    And when mistakes happen and passengers with disabilities 
file a complaint with the Department of Transportation, these 
customers deserve transparency on whether their complaint was 
resolved.
    Senator Fischer and I introduced a Prioritizing 
Accountability and Accessibility for Aviation Consumers Act to 
require DOT to begin publishing a detailed annual report on how 
quickly and effectively these consumer complaints are resolved. 
Before yielding, I want to thank the Chair for including the 
needs of regional airport passengers in today's hearings.
    This past weekend, I was in Collinsville, Illinois, meeting 
with the directors of several of our regional airports from 
across our state. It will come as no surprise to anyone here 
when I tell you they need our help at the regional airports.
    These airports are an economic lifeline to the residents 
and businesses they serve all across our great nation, and we 
need to ensure that they have what they need to keep commercial 
air service available and accessible in their communities.
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on this. With 
that, Madam Chair, I yield back. OK. I will reserve time for 
Ranking Member Moran, when he comes back. And he does come to 
do his opening statements.
    At this time, I would like to introduce our witnesses prior 
to recognizing them for their statements. I begin with Sara 
Nelson, the International President of the Association of 
Flight Attendants, CWA, AFL-CIO. Thank you for being here, Ms. 
Nelson. Mr. William McGee, Senior Fellow for Aviation and 
Travel, American Economic Liberties Project.
    Thank you for being here. Trent Moyers, Airport Director, 
Pangborn Memorial Airport. Very much looking forward to hearing 
your perspective. Diana Moss, President of the American 
Antitrust Institute. Thank you for being here. And Heather 
Ansley, Associate Executive Director of Government Relations, 
the Paralyzed Veterans of America. We will begin with Sara 
Nelson.

STATEMENT OF SARA NELSON, INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT, ASSOCIATION 
               OF FLIGHT ATTENDANTS-CWA, AFL-CIO

    Ms. Nelson. Thank you, Chair Duckworth, Chair Cantwell, 
Ranking Member Cruz, who is no longer here, and Ranking Member 
Moran for the opportunity to testify today.
    As President of the Association of Flight Attendants, I am 
proud to represent 50,000 flight attendants at 19 airlines, 
ground staff and gate agents represented by our partner union, 
the Communications Workers of America, as well. As flight 
attendants, our workspaces attract passengers travel space.
    We have a long history of fighting for consumer rights 
because our lives depend on addressing passengers' issues, too. 
Since deregulation, mergers have been common and typically 
wreak havoc on our job security, years of service at our 
airlines, pay, pensions, and working conditions.
    We believe antitrust review is critical for workers and 
passengers. But there have been very little limits on 
consolidation. And today we have only four airlines that 
control 81 percent of the market. Our union has direct 
experience with eight mergers in the past decade, and I 
personally experienced more than a dozen proposed mergers, some 
that our union fought to block. We have never before 
enthusiastically endorsed a merger, but this is our position 
today with the proposed JetBlue/Spirit combination.
    We believe the pro-competition stance of this White House, 
together with your critical eyes as lawmakers, the outcry from 
consumers, and the effective work of our aviation unions led 
JetBlue to design a merger plan that can actually begin to 
correct the unchecked consolidation of the past decade.
    This is the anti-merger merger. For safety and comfort, all 
Spirit airplanes will be reconfigured from the 28-inch seat 
pitch, which is the worst in the industry, to the 32-inch seat 
pitch, which is the best minimum standard in the industry.
    The result is far better ratio of gate agents and flight 
attendants to passengers, bigger seats, free Wi-Fi, unlimited 
snacks, and the option to forgo all of that if the passenger 
chooses a lower fare. This would help to address concerns we 
share with Senator Duckworth about safe evacuations.
    We were proud to endorse the Emergency Vacating of Aircraft 
Cabin, EVAC Act, in the last Congress, and we look forward to 
the reintroduction in this Congress and for inclusion in the 
FAA reauthorization bill. No to tiered employment.
    This merger will insource jobs currently contracted out at 
Spirit to make all of these aviation workers direct employees 
of JetBlue with higher pay and benefits. The airline will not 
use any contract flying with regional jets, a practice that the 
major airlines utilize, to keep labor costs on average 45 
percent less than mainline airlines for nearly half of the 
domestic flights in their network.
    More and better jobs. JetBlue has committed to no 
furloughs, no displacements, and an expedited joint contract 
bargaining process that will ensure flight attendants gain the 
benefits of the merger as soon as possible.
    Adding another carrier that must participate in collective 
bargaining to the industry's highest standards increases the 
rate at which workers can improve the value of our jobs, tackle 
economy wide inequality, and spend more goods and services in 
our communities.
    Maintain and expand service to our communities. Combining 
JetBlue and Spirit creates a network that can expand service 
beyond what either airline can do alone. Failing to settle this 
case will do nothing to change today's industry dynamics, but 
it will ensure things stay the same.
    There is not a person in the country who would say that is 
OK. Everything the public hates about flying today would be 
better at the merged airline. We urge lawmakers to encourage 
the Administration to resolve any concerns with the merger and 
enable workers and consumers alike to experience the benefits 
as soon as possible.
    We address many recommendations in our written testimony 
for safe cabin and better passenger experience. These are joint 
priorities with our sister union, the Association of 
Professional Flight Attendants, but let me close with this.
    With nearly 80 years of experience and heart in aviation, 
the members of the Association of Flight Attendants know the 
realities of the aircraft cabin better than anyone. We don't 
just serve drinks, we save lives.
    We don't just negotiate contracts, we move major policy 
issues like the smoking ban, no knives on planes, clean water, 
and safe food on board. The air we breathe matters, and we must 
ensure there is always a safe seat for even our smallest 
passengers.
    Training, rest, and adequate staffing matters as we fight 
fires, de-escalate conflict, revive, and breathe life. We 
safely usher passengers to the big business deal, the family 
vacation, the times of celebration, times of grief, and times 
of battle. We are aviation's first responders and we are the 
last line of defense in aviation security.
    We are the first impression and the smile of aviation 
connecting the people of our nations. Aviation has a long 
history of collaboration among Government, industry, unions, 
scientists, and consumers.
    This collaboration and careful approach to layered safety, 
security, health, and inclusion has built the safest mode of 
transportation, the backbone of the American economy, and the 
access that we enjoy around the world. We look forward to 
working with this committee, to our continued shared 
responsibility.
    Fly with us, make progress with us. We are stronger and 
better together. Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Sara Nelson, International President, Association 
                   of Flight Attendants--CWA, AFL-CIO
Introduction
    Thank you Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, Chair Duckworth, and 
Ranking Member Moran for convening this hearing to examine the need to 
strengthen consumer protections for the U.S. flying public, including 
bolstering Department of Transportation rules, enhancing accessibility 
for the disability community and exploring the intersection of 
competition and customer service. We are pleased the Committee is also 
focused on the importance of air service connectivity for small and 
rural communities.
    My name is Sara Nelson. I am a twenty-six year union flight 
attendant and president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, 
AFL-CIO (AFA), representing 50,000 flight attendants at 19 airlines 
across the industry. We also coordinate closely with our partner union 
the Communications Workers of America, our sister union the Association 
of Professional Flight Attendants and all of the transportation union 
affiliates of the Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO.
    Flight Attendants are aviation's first responders and charged with 
the safety, health and security of the passengers in our care. Our work 
space is a passenger's travel space. We have a long history of fighting 
for consumer rights because we share the same space and many of the 
same concerns. Historically, our union has played a leading role in 
efforts to improve conditions for passengers and this testimony details 
how this continues today through several of our legislative and 
regulatory priorities for improving conditions on and off the plane.
Consumer Issues
The Anti-Merger, Merger: A Win for Passengers and Aviation Workers
    A big win for passengers and aviation workers would be a successful 
merger between JetBlue and Spirit. (Note: Although this is an 
acquisition on the front end, the workers only experience the effects 
of the transaction once the financial closing is complete and the 
merger of operations commences. Business decisions by management should 
never determine the worth or value of working people. Our union ensures 
every Flight Attendant has equal standing during any corporate 
transaction. That is why we only refer to this as a ``merger.'')
    We have experience with eight mergers in the past decade, and I 
personally have experience with more than a dozen proposed mergers--
some that we successfully blocked. There is good reason to approach any 
consolidation with a heavy dose of skepticism. We have never before 
concluded that a merger creates improved conditions for workers and 
passengers, but that is our determination in this case. We believe the 
pro-competition stance of this White House together with the critical 
eye of lawmakers, the outcry from consumers, and the effective work of 
our aviation unions led JetBlue to design a plan that can actually 
begin to correct the consolidation of pricing power among four major 
airlines, promote collective bargaining to the highest standards for 
good jobs, and improve service to our communities.
    The JetBlue-Spirit combination is the first merger that we 
enthusiastically support because it sets competition to the highest 
standards for workers and consumers. Specifically, these are the 
protections and improvements that led to our endorsement of this 
merger:

    Safety and Comfort. All Spirit airplanes will be reconfigured from 
28'' seat pitch, which is the worst in the industry, to 32'' seat pitch 
which is the best minimum standard in the industry. This means more 
comfort for passengers and a far better ratio of gate agents and Flight 
Attendant to passengers. This improves safety, comfort, and contributes 
to a better flying environment that has been plagued with disruptive 
and violent episodes on our planes and gate areas. JetBlue will use 
larger airplanes and fly each plane more to maintain or even add 
capacity to the industry. This keeps fares low, while making flying 
better for everyone. Bigger seats, free wifi, unlimited snacks, and the 
option to forgo all of that for even lower fares if passengers so 
choose. This would contribute to addressing very real concerns detailed 
in Senator Duckworth's Emergency Vacating of Aircraft Cabin (EVAC) Act. 
Our union has expressed significant concerns with the shrinking cabin 
environment and the increased ratio of passengers to Flight Attendants. 
Both of these issues are improved in the merger.
    JetBlue is the only carrier that has published a clear passenger 
bill of rights, including what the airline gives consumers if flights 
are delayed or canceled as a result of a preventable incident. They 
also proactively refund $15 to passengers if the WiFi or Inflight 
entertainment is inoperative.
    No Two-Tiered Employment. This merger will in-source jobs currently 
contracted out at Spirit to make all of these aviation workers direct 
employees of JetBlue with higher pay and benefits. The airline will not 
use any contract flying with regional jets, a practice that the major 
airlines utilize to keep labor costs on average 45 percent less than 
mainline airlines for nearly half of the domestic flights in their 
network. This immediately increases access to thousands of improved 
aviation jobs and puts pressure on the mega airlines to compete to the 
highest standards for workers.
    More, Better Jobs. JetBlue has committed to no furloughs, no 
displacements, and an expedited joint collective bargaining process 
that will ensure Flight Attendants gain the benefits of the merger as 
soon as possible. Spirit management recently reached an agreement with 
our union to close out open contract negotiations, affecting more than 
6000 Flight Attendants. The short-term contract provides immediate 
double-digit raises from 10-27 percent, out year additional raises, 
scheduling improvements and other benefits. This sets up the 
opportunity for significant further improvements for the combined 
Flight Attendant group through an expedited joint collective bargaining 
process already committed to in writing by JetBlue, but only if the 
concerns of the DOJ are resolved and this merger moves forward. Adding 
another carrier that must participate in collective bargaining to the 
industry's highest standards increases the rate at which workers can 
improve the value of our jobs, tackle economy-wide inequality, and 
spend more on goods and services in our communities.
    Maintain/Expand Service to our Communities. Combining JetBlue and 
Spirit creates a network that can expand service beyond what either 
airline can do alone. For example, Spirit serves Charleston, WV today, 
but the airline recently announced it will be leaving the market this 
spring. Combined as a national carrier with more efficient planes and 
connections, the airline can maintain and grow service. This is good 
news for more consumer choice in many markets like Charleston.
    Failing to settle this case will do nothing to change today's 
industry dynamics, but it will ensure things stay the same. There's not 
a person in the country who would say that's okay. Everything the 
public hates about flying today would be better at the merged airline.
    We strongly support the JetBlue-Spirit merger and urge lawmakers to 
encourage the Administration to quickly move forward with their suit 
and adhere to decades of agency precedence to ensure the financial 
merger closing occurs in the near term. We want Flight Attendants, 
other workers, and consumers to be able to access the benefits of the 
merger as soon as possible.
Issues in the Passenger Cabin
A Seat for Every Passenger
    Today there is no requirement to protect our smallest passengers in 
their own seat with a proper restraint device. Children under the age 
of two can fly as a ``lap child'' in the same seat as their parent or 
guardian. The FAA \1\, the National Transportation Board (NTSB), 
independent researchers, and Flight Attendants have all concluded this 
is dangerous. Studies show that lap children are at higher risk of 
injuries caused by falling from their parents' laps, sudden or severe 
turbulence, and trauma incurred in a crash.\2\ Indeed, in the worst-
case scenario of a crash or severe turbulence, it would be effectively 
impossible for a parent to hold onto their unbelted child.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In 1994, for example, one infant without a seat and proper 
restraint died and another was severely injured after their plane had 
to make an emergency landing off of its runway. After investigating the 
crash, the NTSB determined that, had the babies been in their own, FAA-
approved safety seats next to their parents, they would not have 
suffered significant injury.\3\ The majority of car seats sold in the 
U.S. and Canada are certified for use on aircraft. In recent decades, 
both the NTSB and a White House Commission on Aviation Safety and 
Security have recommended that the FAA prohibit infants under age 2 
from sitting on their parents' laps.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In 2001, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended requiring 
aircraft-approved restraint systems and discontinuing the policy of 
allowing a child younger than 2 years to be held on the lap of an adult 
during taxi, takeoff, landing and turbulence.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    More recently, responding to strong support from its Member States 
around the world, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 
released the Second Edition of its Manual on the Approval and Use of 
Child Restraint Systems. This manual details guidance to promote the 
use of child restraints on a global level, simplify international 
operations, and make it easier for passengers traveling with CRS.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ https://store.icao.int/en/manual-on-the-approval-and-use-of-
child-restraint-systems-doc-10049
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There remains no credible rationale for the U.S. to fail to require 
that all passengers, including infants and children under the age of 
two, have their own seats and be properly restrained during critical 
phases of flight, just like requirements at all times in a car. This 
requirement should apply to all U.S. carriers and foreign carriers 
flying to the U.S. Following instruction from lawmakers, the FAA can 
use the ICAO guidance to address all related issues, including the 
harmonization of approved child restraint systems.
    It's past time to mandate this protection for our youngest 
passengers.
Air Turbulence
    Severe turbulence is happening more frequently and is more intense. 
Last summer, a flight from Chicago to Salt Lake City experienced 
moderate turbulence that caused minor injuries to three flight 
attendants and one passenger \7\. July 2022, six passengers and two 
crew members were injured on a flight from Tampa to Nashville after 
unexpected turbulence. Seven were taken to the hospital with neck and 
back pain \8\. In December 2022, 36 people were injured and 20 people 
were taken to the emergency room on a flight from Phoenix to Honolulu. 
Four passengers and two Flight Attendants were seriously hurt \9\. On 
another flight in December, Three passengers and two Flight Attendants 
injured following severe turbulence and taken to the hospital on a 
flight heading from Brazil to Houston, TX \10\. In February 2023, two 
passengers and one Flight Attendant were injured following turbulence 
and taken to the hospital on a flight heading from Newark to Tampa 
\11\. Earlier this month, a flight hit severe turbulence at 37,000 feet 
over Tennessee. Seven passengers were injured and taken to the hospital 
after the flight diverted to Washington Dulles Airport \12\.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    For Flight Attendants and passengers, these incidents pose a 
serious occupational and travel risk. In a report issued on August, 10 
2021 \13\ the NTSB concluded:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-studies/Documents/
SS2101.pdf

  <bullet> the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Weather 
        Service and airline industry associations take specific actions 
        to reduce the number of turbulence-related injuries in air 
        carrier operations. While it seems like common sense, the 
        NTSB's recommendations stated ``Wearing a seat belt reduces the 
        risk of serious injury for all aircraft occupants during 
        turbulence-related accidents in Title 14 Code of Federal 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Regulations Part 121 air carrier operations.''

  <bullet> having flight attendants seated with their seat belts 
        fastened during additional portions of the descent phase of 
        flight would reduce the rate of flight attendant injuries due 
        to turbulence and the rate of turbulence-related accidents 
        overall.''

  <bullet> ``the safest place for a child under the age of 2 is in a 
        CRS.''

    We appreciate the leadership of Chair Cantwell to author key 
provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) such as increased 
funding for the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to 
fund climate research for atmospheric processes to examine the causes 
and impacts of extreme weather. These investments will support the 
development of more accurate/timely weather forecasts, and improved 
climate change predictions. In addition, NOAA also received funding to 
acquire a new Gulfstream G550 Hurricane Hunter to collect data when 
large storms appear, which is vital for knowing where storms will hit 
and how strong they will be. Improved weather forecasts can have a 
profound impact on saving lives, jobs, businesses and communities.
Cabin Temperature--2HOT2COLD
    Currently, no Federal standards define an acceptable temperature 
range for airplane cabins. As a result, passengers and Flight 
Attendants often experience discomfort, fatigue, and stress due to 
excessively high or low cabin temperatures. Extreme temperatures can 
cause passengers and crew to experience severe or life-threatening 
symptoms, including heat stroke, loss of consciousness, and respiratory 
arrest.
    In 2017, a four month old baby overheated on the plane after being 
delayed on the tarmac for two hours and was having trouble breathing 
\14\. The Flight Attendants bagged ice to place on the baby, an 
ambulance was called and paramedics met the aircraft. There are 
numerous examples of passengers and Flight Attendants who have suffered 
from extreme temperatures on the plane, but this can become a priority 
to fix when temperature standards are put in place.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \14\ https://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/23/united-airlines-infant-
overheats-dia/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We urge the Committee to include language in the FAA 
reauthorization bill that will require the FAA to adopt the temperature 
standards recommended by the American Society of Heating, 
Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). These standards 
state that the temperature onboard planes should be between 65-80 
degrees on the ground (up to 85 if in-flight-entertainment is on), and 
up to 80 degrees during the flight.
Improve Cabin Air Quality
    Except for the Boeing 787, the ventilation air that passengers and 
crew breathe during a flight is referred to as ``bleed air'' because it 
is bled off the engine compressors. This high-temperature and pressure 
``bleed air'' is then cooled, mixed with recirculated air, and 
distributed to the cabin and flight deck for ventilation. The problem 
with this design is that oil intended to lubricate the engines can 
accidentally contaminate the bleed air stream, whether as a result of a 
mechanical failure, oil seals that don't close fully during an engine 
power change, or overservicing by maintenance staff.
    In a published review of FAA maintenance databases, U.S. airlines 
documented an average of 5.3 oil or hydraulic fluid events per day,\15\ 
which does not include all events. In addition to the potential for 
long-term health effects, including neurological and respiratory damage 
to crew and passengers, toxic fumes can impact flight safety and 
security by impairing or incapacitating crewmembers. Further, fume 
events often recur on the same airplanes after airlines deem planes 
with faulty bleed systems airworthy despite not having fixed the 
underlying problem.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

of the frequency and nature of bleed air contamination events in 
commercial aircraft,'' Indoor Air, 26(3): 478-488, doi: 10.1111/
ina.12211. Epub 2015 Apr 25.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We urge the Committee to include the Cabin Air Safety Act of 2022 
(S.3944/H.R. 7267) (soon to be reintroduced in the 118th Congress) to 
direct the FAA to issue regulations requiring: airline worker training 
to document fume events, suitable sensors on aircraft to detect a 
variety of contaminants and fumes in real time, and investigate bleed 
air events. The legislation also mandates that airlines provide flight 
crew, maintenance technicians, and emergency response teams training on 
how to respond to and identify the causes of fume events.
Add Naloxone Nasal Spray to Required Onboard Items
    In 2019, AFA and several members of Congress petitioned the FAA to 
require naloxone, a life saving medicine that quickly reverses and 
blocks the effects of opioids, to be included onboard the aircraft. The 
FAA has not responded to the petition or issued guidance. While a few 
air carriers have added naloxone to their EMKs, it is typically the 
injectable naloxone rather than a preferred option, which is the nasal 
spray. The injectable naloxone takes longer to take effect and is not 
as effective as the spray.
    We encourage the Committee to add language to the FAA 
reauthorization bill that says `The FAA shall issue guidance that 
commercial air carriers must include naloxone nasal spray on board 
within 90 days of enactment.'
Violent Attacks Negatively Impact Airline Crew and Passengers
    A few weeks ago, the Department of Justice charged a passenger \16\ 
for allegedly attempting to open an emergency exit door while aboard a 
United Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Boston and then allegedly 
attempting to stab a Flight Attendant in the neck. AFA is proud of the 
crew of United Flight 2609 and relieved that no one sustained life-
threatening physical injuries. Violence has no place anywhere and 
certainly not in a closed cabin flying several miles in the air. When 
incidents like this happen, it not only risks the safety of the crew 
involved, it takes away from Flight Attendants' ability to respond to 
medical, safety, or security emergencies of other passengers. We are 
thankful for the FBI's quick action on this. This is another example of 
the urgent need for a national banned disruptive passenger list.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\ https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/man-arrested-attempting-
open-emergency-exit-door-aboard-flight-boston
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition to the terrible assaults Flight Attendants experience 
while on duty, passenger service agents are experiencing an increased 
amount of passenger rage and their experiences often go unrecognized. 
These incidents vary from using vulgar language when addressing 
employees, using racial epithets that cause psychological harm to our 
agents, to punching, biting, kicking, shoving and even spitting on 
them. Union representatives report the highest number of calls to 
employee assistance programs searching for ways to cope with fatigue, 
stress and fear caused by these incidents.
    We call on this Committee to include language in the FAA 
reauthorization bill that bans these passengers from flying on all 
airlines so they cannot commit these violent acts again.
    These negative flying experiences make deep impressions and can 
create terrible consequences. But we must also note that the vast 
majority of interactions we have are positive and we can especially 
celebrate the ways crews across the industry have pulled together to 
support each other. As with everything we do, Flight Attendants have 
incredible emotional intelligence to assess the subtleties of every 
situation, step up for every crewmember when they need a break and 
successfully get tens of thousands of flights and millions of people 
safely to their destination without event and even with a smile.
Bare Minimum Staffing Levels
    Staffing of Flight Attendants on planes, at the gate, and in ground 
support was cut to minimums pre-COVID. There is no ``give'' in the 
system. Pre-COVID airlines counted on high overtime hours to staff the 
operation. With a seasoned workforce, and a normal hiring rate for 
typical attrition, the frontline workforce knew our jobs well and often 
``made it work'' when operational hiccups occurred.
    According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), U.S. 
airlines carried 194 million more passengers in 2022 than in 2021, up 
30 percent year-to-year \17\. Yet, almost all domestic flights are 
staffed with the minimum number of Flight Attendants, so when something 
goes wrong there's no additional crew already in the operation to help 
staff flights. When we think of the disruptive passenger incidents 
we've seen, often there is a single flight attendant facing unhinged 
rages.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Adding the conditions of the pandemic, which include higher rates 
of sickness among the workforce, difficulties with commuting to work on 
full planes, compressed cabin environments, increased turbulence, 
weakened infrastructure to support operational irregularities, a 
combative environment, mass retirements with fewer seasoned workers to 
mentor new employees on the job, and a somewhat chaotic network that 
was a response to new trends of passenger demand and little ability to 
forecast--Flight Airlines and other aviation workers are feeling the 
stress and strain of an operation stretched to its limit.
Staffing at the Gate
    Gate agents are a vital part of a multilayered airline security and 
safety process at the airport and their importance can not be 
understated. The safety of ground service workers is a priority. At the 
gates, oftentimes one passenger service agent is left to board full 
planes by themselves creating communication issues during the boarding 
process. And when a flight gets delayed or canceled that same agent or 
sometimes no one is left in the terminal to assist passengers--making 
an already difficult situation worse.
    The airlines and the airports are too reliant on overtime hours to 
meet basic operational metrics. This way of doing business needs to 
stop or the industry will be run into the ground and it puts safety at 
risk.
    Increase staffing at the gate and on each flight. We need more 
frontline workers in the airports and on planes who are able to answer 
questions, identify problems early in order to de-escalate, or simply 
have backup from other workers when issues get out of hand or require 
physical restraint and a law enforcement response.
Crew Scheduling Difficulties
    Excessive call wait times to get through to Crew Scheduling and 
FAST to conduct routine tasks--calling off sick leave to return to 
schedule, to obtain staffing, to secure hotels to ensure rest, 
rescheduling after weather induced irregular operations, changes to 
Reserve assignments and the list goes on. When we can't reach 
scheduling or get recrewed that has a ripple effect on other flights. 
The compounding effect is massive delays or cancellations.
Schedule and Operational Disruptions
    Flight attendants are on the frontlines when an operational 
meltdown occurs, and they are expected to address passenger concerns. 
But Flight Attendants have been left empty handed or stranded 
themselves without support from management who are running the airline.
    The summer of 2022 was one of the worst in recent history in terms 
of chaotic scheduling and other workplace woes. Flight attendants at 
United and Southwest airlines staged protests at airports across the 
U.S. to draw attention to this and urged our airlines to fix problems 
that were creating havoc for flight attendants and travelers alike.
Update Emergency Aircraft Evacuation Standards
    As part of implementing Sections 337 and 577 of the FAA 
Reauthorization Act of 2018,\18\ the FAA conducted a study in late 2019 
through early 2020 to determine the effects of different seat 
dimensions and spacing on facilitating emergency evacuations. However, 
the FAA used simulated laboratory conditions, and not a real airplane, 
to conduct its evaluation. Further, the study sample did not include 
any children, adults over 60, or people with disabilities as 
participants.\19\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Since children, older adults, and people with disabilities are the 
least likely to be able to evacuate an airplane in a safe and timely 
manner, the FAA's study did not demonstrate or accurately depict if all 
passengers can safely evacuate an airplane in under 90 seconds (the 
standard amount of time for an emergency evacuation). Indeed, the FAA 
itself conceded that, because they did not include these groups in 
their study, the study's results were ``not necessarily definitive.''

Conclusion
    We thank the committee for this opportunity to testify. 
Improvements to our workspace directly enhance the passenger's travel 
experience. Aviation has a long history of collaboration among 
government, industry, unions, scientists, and consumers. This 
collaboration and careful approach to layered safety, security, health, 
and inclusion has built the safest mode of transportation, the backbone 
of the American economy, and the access that we enjoy around the world. 
We look forward to working with this committee to continue our shared 
responsibility to ensure a safe, inclusive, efficient and reliable 
aviation system that brings us together at home and around the world.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Ms. Nelson. And I do want to 
apologize for not recognizing previously the honorable Jeff 
Shane. Thank you for your service as a Former Undersecretary at 
the Department of Transportation. Welcome. I will now recognize 
Mr. Moyers for his statement.

STATEMENT OF TRENT MOYERS, DIRECTOR OF AIRPORTS, CHELAN DOUGLAS 
                    REGIONAL PORT AUTHORITY

    Mr. Moyers. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Cantwell, Ranking 
Member Cruz, Chair Duckworth, and Ranking Member Moran for the 
opportunity to testify. My name is Trent Moyers. I am the 
Director of the Pangborn Memorial Airport in Wenatchee, 
Washington.
    While I don't speak for the hundreds of airports and 
communities who are facing air service challenges, I believe 
our experience in Central Washington's Wenatchee Valley is an 
example of the impacts felt by airports nationwide. Commercial 
air service began in Wenatchee in 1945.
    Fast forward to 2019, and we had a record year for 
enplanements, with more than 64,000 passengers departing from 
our airport. As the reality of the pandemic took hold in 2020, 
that number dropped to 27,000. While passenger numbers rose to 
48,000 the next year in 2021, last year enplanements fell again 
to 35,000. Today--sorry. Service in Wenatchee and many small 
airports has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, largely due 
to a lack of airline capacity.
    The number of daily flights to our airport has gone from 
four in recent years down to one. The post-pandemic recovery of 
air service continues to be challenging Wenatchee, but we know 
we are not alone.
    Today, 76 percent of airports have less air service than 
before the pandemic. 14 U.S. airports have lost all commercial 
air service. And 53 airports, like ours, have lost over half of 
their flights. The Wenatchee Valley is known proudly as the 
apple capital of the world and is home to a population of 
approximately 120,000.
    In addition to a robust agricultural economy, a relatively 
new type of farm has cropped up thanks to our affordable and 
clean hydroelectric energy, server farms, both invest heavily 
in our area. Tree fruit farms and server farms are linked to 
the global economy, and as such, these industries have a need 
to connect with their consumers and suppliers far beyond our 
region.
    In Chair Cantwell's opening remarks and last week mentioned 
during the hearing regarding aviation workforce issues, you 
mentioned that over 80 percent of economic development occurs 
within ten miles of an airport. The statement is true in 
Wenatchee, where just one mile from the airport, Microsoft has 
completed construction of the first of six 240,000 square foot 
data centers that has created 50 full time jobs, with plans to 
invest a total of $3 billion in the community.
    Another example of a high-tech industry finding its way to 
Wenatchee occurred in 2018 when Diamond Foundry, a company 
located and headquartered in San Francisco, established a 
diamond growing facility in Wenatchee.
    Air transportation accessibility was among the key factors 
that contributed to their selection of Wenatchee as a suitable 
site. In the Wenatchee Valley, 850 people drive every day to an 
airport other than Pangborn because connectivity from Wenatchee 
is limited. A single flight per day to Seattle means only 76 
people can directly access air transportation to or from 
Wenatchee without spending 3 hours driving.
    Finally, I want to note that in Wenatchee, commercial air 
service saves lives. Last year, Airlift Northwest, an air 
ambulance operator based at our airport conducted 700 ambulance 
flights. They depend on our commercial air service to deliver 
blood supplies and flight nurses, and in the winter, they are 
able to land and take off because of our FAA requirements to 
remove snow from the runway in support of air carrier 
operations.
    Our community needs continued access to commercial aviation 
to keep these essential services. Given all of these impacts, 
Congress should act to restore--to revitalize air service in 
small and rural communities. Senator Cantwell has been a leader 
in promoting the SCASDP Program, and Senator, I thank you for 
that.
    Possible actions could include allowing greater flexibility 
in existing programs. Airline business strategies change over 
time, and the terminal grant should be able to meet those 
changing market demands. If adequate incentives that are 
attractive to airlines and supportive of the communities, they 
serve are available, the likelihood of successful airline 
recruitment improves.
    The upcoming FAA reauthorization presents a key opportunity 
to examine and improve air access for small communities. For 
someone who manages a small airport, the correlation between 
airport improvement programs and air service development and 
retention programs is clear. The challenge of an airport with a 
limited budget and limited service means that sometimes being 
forced to choose between infrastructure improvements and air 
service incentives is a reality.
    Paying the 10 percent local share of an FAA funded project 
can mean sacrificing other priorities, like pursuing air 
service expansion. I would encourage the Committee to restore 
the 95 percent Federal cost share for small airports that was 
put in place in the 2003 FAA bill to help address this 
challenge.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look 
forward to answering any questions you may have.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Moyers follows:]

       Prepared Statement of Trent Moyers, Director of Airports, 
                 Chelan Douglas Regional Port Authority
    Thank you, Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and members of the 
committee for the opportunity to testify today. My name is Trent 
Moyers, and for the past 10 years I have served as the Director of the 
Pangborn Memorial Airport, located in Wenatchee, Washington.
    My aim today is to discuss air service challenges in my own 
community and highlight common themes of broader, national concern that 
are impacting communities throughout the county. While I do not speak 
for the hundreds of airports and communities who are facing air service 
challenges across the nation, I believe our experience in Central 
Washington's Wenatchee Valley is an example of the impacts felt by 
small airports nationwide.
Commercial Air Service Challenges in Wenatchee
    Our airport is named after the pilot Clyde Pangborn, who along with 
his co-pilot Hugh Herndon were the first people to fly non-stop across 
the Pacific Ocean from Misawa, Japan to East Wenatchee, WA in 1931. 
That historic event in a single-engine airplane took 41 hours to 
accomplish. Fourteen years later, Northwest Airlines became the first 
carrier to provide air service to Wenatchee. Fast forward to 2019, and 
we had a record year for enplanements, with 64,609 passengers passing 
through our airport. As the reality of the pandemic took hold, in 2020 
that number dropped to 27,008. While passenger numbers rose to 48,338 
in 2021, last year, enplanements fell again to 34,700.
    Air service has not rebounded at Pangborn primarily because we have 
seen the four daily flights to Seattle prior to the pandemic now 
reduced to one. That means the number of daily seats for passengers in 
our market has been reduced from 304 down to only 76 per day. Clearly, 
the post-pandemic recovery of air service continues to be challenging 
in Wenatchee, but we know we're not alone. Today, 76 percent of U.S. 
airports have less air service than before the pandemic. Fourteen U.S. 
airports have lost all commercial air service, and 53 airports, like 
ours, have lost over half of their flights.
    The Wenatchee Valley is known as ``the apple capital of the world'' 
and is home to a population of approximately 120,000. In addition to a 
robust agricultural economy, a relatively new type of farm has cropped 
up thanks to our affordable, clean, and renewable hydro-electric 
energy: server farms. This hi-tech industry has invested heavily in our 
area. Companies such as Microsoft, Intuit, Dell, and Sabey all have a 
presence in the region. Tree fruit farms and server farms are both 
linked to the global economy. As such, these industries have a need to 
connect with their consumers and suppliers far beyond the Wenatchee 
Valley.
    Last week, during this Committee's hearing regarding aviation 
workforce issues, Chair Cantwell mentioned that around 80 percent of 
all economic development occurs within 10 miles of an airport. This 
statement is verifiably true in Wenatchee where less than one mile from 
Pangborn Memorial airport, Microsoft has completed construction on the 
first of three 240,000 square foot data centers that has created 50 
full-time jobs. At buildout, the total estimated investment at this 
location will be $1.5 billion. Microsoft has applied for building 
permits to construct three more similarly sized data centers 
approximately three miles from the airport in nearby Malaga; investing 
another $1.5 billion in the process and creating additional jobs.
    Another example of hi-tech industry finding its way to our region 
occurred in 2018 when Diamond Foundry, a company headquartered in San 
Francisco, established a diamond growing facility in Wenatchee. One 
year later, Diamond Foundry began producing diamonds using Wenatchee's 
hydroelectric power sources. The technology used in their laboratory 
setting replicates nature's own process to produce ``gem-quality'' 
diamonds for retail as well as diamond-based semiconductors. Along with 
their need for affordable, clean energy to maintain a zero-carbon 
footprint, Diamond Foundry also cited air transportation accessibility 
as a key reason that contributed to their selection of the Wenatchee 
site.
    Airports of all sizes bolster their local economies by connecting 
passengers and cargo with where they need to go, but it's important to 
note that having commercial air service also directly provides 
workforce opportunities for their communities, from airline and TSA 
staff, to aircraft servicing, administration, operations and 
maintenance, and public safety.
    A well-used colloquialism in the aviation industry is ``if you've 
seen one airport, you've seen one airport.'' It's important to 
recognize the unique qualities of all airports and the communities they 
serve. However, there is a common theme wherever the struggle to regain 
or retain air service continues, regardless of location: air service is 
a critical component of the local economy.
    There are 245 nonhub airports in the U.S. and its territories--
airports that have at least 10,000 passengers annually, but less than 
0.5 percent of the national total. The following are just a few 
examples of communities with a nonhub airport that have been impacted 
by reductions in air service:

        In Illinois--Champaign/Urbana has just 60 percent of the number 
        of seats that it had before the pandemic. More than 75 percent 
        of all passengers in the area drive to Chicago to access 
        flights.

        In Kansas--Topeka is currently without air service. It seems 
        unlikely the state capital will regain service without a large 
        enough financial incentive for an air carrier to restore 
        service. For now, most consumers who visit via air fly in and 
        out of its closest neighbor 70 miles away, Kansas City, 
        Missouri.

        In Nevada--Elko (an airport I used to manage) is geographically 
        challenged when it comes to air service even though there are 
        major airports in every direction: the closest option is a 
        three-hour drive east to Salt Lake City, UT. The other airports 
        are Reno, NV (more than four hours west), Boise, ID (four hours 
        north), and Las Vegas, NV (seven hours south). Currently, Elko 
        has one flight per day to Salt Lake City.

    In the Wenatchee Valley, 850 people drive every day to an airport 
other than Pangborn because connectivity from Wenatchee is limited. A 
single flight per day to Seattle means only 76 people can directly 
access air transportation from Wenatchee without spending at least 3 
hours driving. Compounding this issue even further is the fact that 
there is no direct interstate access to Wenatchee. The closest 
interstate, I-90, is 40 miles away via a two-lane highway. Wenatchee is 
one of only eight Metropolitan Areas nationwide with no direct access 
to an interstate or four-lane highway.
    This issue of connectivity is further exacerbated for those driving 
to Seattle as the drive requires crossing mountain passes. On any given 
day, highway closures due to avalanche control, wildland fires, or 
motor vehicle accidents are possible. Thus, there are times when air 
service is the only option in or out of Wenatchee for people headed to 
Seattle and beyond.
Current Airline Incentives Don't Meet the Need
    Federal support for rural airport service from programs like 
Essential Air Service (EAS) and the Small Community Air Service 
Development Program (SCASDP) is vital. But Wenatchee's story shows why 
today the current level of investment doesn't come close to addressing 
the challenge. At Pangborn, we were awarded a SCASDP grant in 2018, for 
$700,000, to attract new air service. To successfully compete for that 
grant, we raised $401,000 from the local community. Even with this 
level of support, we have yet to attract a carrier to provide new 
service.
    The Department of Transportation just last week released its notice 
of funding for this year's SCASD program. $15 million is available for 
a maximum of 40 awards, which pencils out to an average award amount of 
only $375,000. Based on my experience, I believe with this level of 
investment it will be difficult for many communities to successfully 
secure new service from airlines. If we are to do more to restore air 
service to small and rural communities, we need to look at what changes 
to these programs need to be made to make them more effective.
    The President of the Air Line Pilot Association, Jason Ambrosi, 
testified before this Committee last week that, ``We believe air 
service to small and rural communities is a national responsibility and 
that safe, efficient, and reliable air service to these communities is 
a critical component of our national air transportation system.''
    I concur with Mr. Ambrosi that Congress should take action to 
restore or revitalize air service in small and rural communities. 
Possible actions could include allowing greater flexibility in existing 
EAS and SCASD programs. If adequate incentives that are attractive to 
airlines and supportive of the communities they serve are available, 
the likelihood of successful airline recruitment improves. An airline 
that flies a route that does not foster resiliency is unlikely to 
operate beyond the life of the grant funds.
    Suggestions offered by Mr. Ambrosi to amend EAS included ``changing 
the subsidy and enplanement cap, allowing air carriers to renegotiate 
EAS contracts to account for unforeseen operating costs, revising the 
DOT's calculation for driving distance, allowing communities that lost 
EAS service to regain or reestablish eligibility, and revise the DOT's 
process for carrier selection.'' I believe that similarly providing 
greater flexibility for SCASDP, expanding on actions taken in the 2018 
bill, could similarly provide benefits for non-EAS airports, along with 
ensuring the level of grant funding is sufficient to incentivize air 
carriers to add service for the long term. Addressing workforce 
challenges throughout the aviation industry must also be a priority.
    Funding that our community puts towards recruiting air service is 
funding that can't go towards airport infrastructure. For someone who 
manages a small airport, the correlation between air service 
development and retention programs and airport improvement programs is 
evident. Both are impactful components of FAA reauthorization for 
airports of our size. Without the support of FAA funding, the ability 
for small airports to complete capital improvement projects is 
daunting, if not impossible.
    Fortunately, the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 
figuratively and literally paves the way for airports to ensure they 
continue to remain viable. Commercial service airports of all sizes, 
ranging from Wenatchee to Atlanta, work diligently to comply with FAA 
standards while meeting the growing needs of their communities.
    The challenge of an airport with limited air service and a limited 
budget means that sometimes choosing between infrastructure projects 
and air service incentives is a reality. At Pangborn, we face 
particular funding challenges because so much of our surrounding area 
is owned by the Federal government (in our case, as National Forest 
land). 79 percent of Chelan County is Federal land, which deprives us 
of the ability to collect tax revenue on these lands which could be put 
towards airport improvements. Congress has previously recognized this 
challenge and in 2003 increased the Federal share for Airport 
Improvement Program (AIP) projects from 90 to 95 percent for small 
airports in states with a high share of Federal lands. That provision 
expired in 2011. Restoring the Federal share to 95 percent would 
provide significant help to Wenatchee and communities like ours that 
are deprived of tax revenues due to high levels of Federal land 
holdings.
Closing Remarks
    Ninety-two years ago, our airport's namesake Clyde Pangborn bravely 
and literally took off into the unknown and accomplished what had never 
been done before. The issues we face together to safeguard the future 
of accessible air transportation are challenging in their own right, 
and I want to thank the Chair and the Members of the Committee for 
their thoughtful leadership on these critical issues.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to 
answering any questions you may have, and to working with the Committee 
to find ways to ensure air service is readily accessible to communities 
nationwide.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Mr. Moyers. I now recognize 
Mr. McGee.

                  STATEMENT OF WILLIAM McGEE,

             SENIOR FELLOW FOR AVIATION AND TRAVEL,

              AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES PROJECT

    Mr. McGee. Thank you, Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, 
Chair Duckworth, Ranking Member Moran, and members of the 
Committee. My name is William Jay McGee and I am the Senior 
Fellow for Aviation and Travel at the American Economic 
Liberties Project. Starting in 1985, I spent 7 years in airline 
flight operations management, and I am licensed by the Federal 
Aviation Administration as an aircraft dispatcher. I then 
became an aviation journalist and author. For the last 20 
years, I have been an airline passenger advocate, testifying on 
consumer rights, competition, consolidation, and safety issues, 
and I served as a lone consumer advocate on Transportation 
Secretary LaHood's future of Aviation Advisory Committee.
    The nation's airline industry has broken, and it has found 
us lurching from crisis to crisis, meltdown to meltdown, as the 
interests of consumers, workers, and entire regions of the 
country are subjugated to the interests of a handful of 
institutional investors, lobbyists, and senior executives.
    Every day, passengers are faced with fewer choices, higher 
fares, and a plethora of junk fees. Flight disruptions have 
become the norm rather than the exception. And when things go 
wrong, as they so often do now, we are at the mercy of the 
airline's own contracts of carriage. These are rules that are 
written by and most assuredly for the airlines.
    We have seen new lows in customer service despite a $54 
billion taxpayer bailout during COVID-19. Over the last 2 years 
alone, we have seen record numbers of flight delays and 
cancellations, $10 billion in unpaid refunds, tighter and 
tighter seats that pose not only health, but emergency 
evacuation threats, not just to the disabled, but to all 
passengers, and ubiquitous fees that President Biden referenced 
in his recent State of the Union address, including the 
nefarious practice of charging families with young children to 
sit together. Airfares have never been more confusing and less 
tied to the cost of operation.
    Overall, passengers have never been more dissatisfied. 
Airline labor has been decimated by layoffs and outsourcing. 
Entire regions have been disconnected from global access, and 
major cities have lost the airport hubs and frequent service 
that incite corporations to move headquarters.
    The FAA safety net is eroding, and at no time in the 
industry's 109-year-old history have Americans had less choice. 
There are now fewer scheduled passenger airlines than in 1978. 
The big four oligopoly controls an unprecedented 80 percent of 
the market, and we just saw a 14-year dearth from 2007 to 2021 
of no new entrant airlines.
    These are the symptoms, not the causes of much larger 
difficulties. The 1978 Airline Deregulation Act promised to 
introduce competition, lower fares, and expand access to flying 
for millions of Americans.
    And instead, we have seen more than 100 airline 
bankruptcies in the last four decades and dozens of mergers and 
acquisitions rubberstamped by the U.S Departments of Justice 
and Transportation.
    Today, we find this industry in dire straits. No single 
answer will resolve all the problems, but there are several 
actions that the Executive and legislative branches could take. 
First, AELP urges the members of the Senate Commerce Committee 
to consider the pro-consumer legislation we have supported in 
recent months, including the Airline Passengers Bill of Rights, 
which would require compensation for flight delays and 
cancellations, establish minimum seat size standards, and would 
require compensation for involuntary denied boarding.
    Second, the Forbidding Airlines from Imposing Ridiculous 
Fees Act, which would prohibit airlines from charging 
unreasonable fees. Third, the Family Flies Together--excuse me, 
Families Fly Together Act so that passengers do not have to pay 
fees to ensure children under 13 are seated with their 
families. And fourth, the Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations 
Act, which would force airlines to pay cash and not vouchers, 
which can expire when they cancel flights.
    Also, any further consolidation of the industry should be 
halted. AELP opposes the proposed merger of JetBlue and Spirit 
and we applaud the Departments of Justice and Transportation 
for opposing this harmful acquisition. Third, the Airline 
Deregulation Act included a Federal preemption clause which 
allows Congress and the U.S. Department of Transportation the 
only authority to oversee the airlines.
    Americans have fewer rights when interacting with airlines 
than they have with virtually any other consumer industry. AELP 
has drafted model legislation calling for the elimination of 
preemption, and we are working with members to see that is 
introduced soon as part of this year's FAA Reauthorization Act.
    Finally, we need to fundamentally reconsider our approach 
to regulating the airline industry. It faces immense incentives 
to consolidate, to tack on extra fees, and to erode service 
quality. Any farsighted policy solution needs to eliminate 
these underlying incentives, which mean seriously discussing 
options to comprehensively regulate the industry as we have. 
Thank you very much.
    I will be happy to answer any questions from the Committee.

Prepared Statement of William J. McGee, Senior Fellow for Aviation and

America today. Starting in 1985, I spent seven years in airline flight

speaking for all U.S. airlines last November when it permanently shut 
down its telephone call centers; the message was clear: don't bother 
calling, because we don't want to hear from you.\2\

threats to the Nation's stellar aviation safety record overlooked, 
particularly with FAA oversight of outsourced aircraft maintenance to 
foreign repair stations and oversight of manufacturers, as exemplified 
by the Boeing 737 MAX debacle; efforts to weaken pilot standards; and a 
refusal to mandate restraints for children under 2. The industry shows 
tremendous regional inequities, with entire sections of the country 
denied fair access to air travel, as only larger cities and population 
centers have frequent and nonstop flights at reasonable cost. Overall, 
passengers have never been more dissatisfied, airline labor has been 
decimated by layoffs and outsourcing, and major cities have lost the 
airport hubs and frequent service that incite corporations to move 
headquarters. At no time in the industry's 109-year-old history have 
Americans had fewer choices in commercial air service, and at no time 
have the adverse effects on consolidation been so harmful.\3\

    In recent months AELP has been very vocal on a variety of airline 
consumer issues, including:

  <bullet> fighting to provide basic passenger rights (such as those 
        that are mandatory in the European Union, Canada, and other 
        nations) so that passengers are guaranteed compensation for 
        flight delays, flight cancellations, and involuntary bumping, 
        and ensuring that aircraft seat sizes meet minimum size 
        dimensions

  <bullet> fighting to ensure that airlines are prohibited from 
        charging unreasonable ``junk fees''

  <bullet> fighting to prevent airlines from charging fees for families 
        with children under 13 to sit together inflight

  <bullet> fighting to ensure consumers are given full cash refunds 
        when their flights are canceled

    The United States has not had a national discussion about the state 
of our commercial aviation system for 45 years, and the problems that 
have arisen since the 1970s grow more acute month after month. We are 
long overdue for such a broad discussion, a discussion which transcends 
the latest crisis du jour-unpaid refunds during the pandemic, flight 
cancellations due to crew shortages, Southwest Airlines' holiday IT 
meltdown, the FAA's NOTAM outage. These are the symptoms, not the 
causes, of much larger difficulties. The airlines are broken, and the 
regulatory model overseeing the airlines is just as broken.
The Failures of Deregulation
    We in the United States often tell ourselves a story about airline 
deregulation, and it goes something like this. The airline industry 
used to be regulated by a cumbersome, slow bureaucracy called the Civil 
Aeronautics Board, which set the routes that airlines could fly, set 
the fares that they were allowed to charge consumers, and became 
captured by the big airlines such that no new-entrants were allowed. In 
1978, we passed the Airline Deregulation Act which allowed new airlines 
to enter the market and charge whatever prices the market would bear, 
promising to introduce competition, lower fares, and expand access to 
flying for millions of Americans. The airlines and the defenders of 
deregulation will tell you that deregulation generated three great 
improvements in air travel: 1) more Americans started flying; 2) fares 
started dropping; and 3) the safety record started improving.\4\

    This story can be compelling. However, in the 45 years since the 
Airline Deregulation Act was passed in 1978, one by one the central 
promises of more competition and better service have been broken. What 
they fail to note is that ALL THREE of these trends started long before 
deregulation, and in all three cases the improvements were greater 
prior to 1978. The decline in passenger fares, in particular, actually 
slowed down post-deregulation.\5\

Consolidation
    Deregulation was based on faulty premises-that eliminating 
government oversight would introduce competition, lower prices, and 
better customer experience-and ignoring the positive role that 
government regulation had played in stabilizing the industry. In the 
1980s, when deregulation led to a series of price wars between major 
airlines and put many of them out of business by the 1990s, proponents 
of deregulation saw these developments as positive. Competition was at 
work to bring prices down for flyers. However, without any oversight to 
stabilize the industry from price wars of this sort, the industry faced 
stark choices to either risk bankruptcy or to consolidate into larger 
airlines.
    These pressures eliminated many airlines through either bankruptcy 
or merger activity. We have seen more than 100 bankruptcies in the last 
four decades, many due to major carriers driving out smaller, Low Cost 
Carriers (LCCs). As a result:

  <bullet> We currently have fewer domestic scheduled passenger 
        airlines than we have had since the 1910s, and the dozens of 
        former carriers include such iconic brands as Pan Am, Eastern, 
        TWA, America West, ATA, Midwest, Northwest, Continental, 
        AirTran, U.S. Airways, and Virgin America.

  <bullet> We currently have fewer major carriers than at any time, 
        with an oligopoly of four major carriers and their partners--
        American, Delta, Southwest, and United--controlling 80 percent 
        of the domestic market.

  <bullet> We recently had the longest drought in airline history, from 
        2007 to 2021, of no new-entrant scheduled airlines for 14 
        years.\6\

    Making this situation worse, under deregulation we have seen a 
weaker DOJ on antitrust and merger enforcement. Dozens of mergers and 
acquisitions have been rubber-stamped by the U.S. Departments of 
Justice (DOJ) and Transportation (DOT) in recent decades, including the 
``mega-mergers'' of Delta-Northwest, United-Continental, and American-
US Airways that morphed the Big Six network hub-and-spoke airlines into 
the Big Three. For context, Airlines for America reports that in the 60 
years from 1930 to 1990 there were 28 mergers & acquisitions among U.S. 
airlines, but in the next 30 years through 2020-half that span-there 
were 29. Third, Wall Street investors engage in ``common ownership'' 
practices by simultaneously investing in all of the four largest 
airlines, thereby discouraging true competition, and providing a higher 
barrier to entry for low fare competitors than ever existed during the 
regulated era.\7\

    And despite all of this consolidation, the industry is still not 
stable or consistently profitable, as seen by its need for a specific 
bailout from the Federal government every time there is a significant 
economic crisis. This is an industry that socializes the losses and 
privatizes the profits. American taxpayers provided the airlines with a 
$54 billion bailout during Covid, but that has not stopped the industry 
from prioritizing stock dividends, buybacks, and executive bonuses.\8\

What to Do Now
    We find this industry in dire straits, and no one simple answer 
will resolve all of the problems, but there are several actions that 
the executive and legislative branches could take.
    First, AELP urges the Members of the Senate Commerce Committee to 
consider the pro-consumer legislation we have supported in recent 
months. This includes:

  <bullet> The ``Airline Passengers' Bill of Rights,'' which among 
        other provisions includes compensating passengers for flight 
        delays and cancellations, mandating minimum seat size 
        standards, and providing compensation for involuntary denied 
        boarding: www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-

        0
        denied%20boarding

  <bullet> The ``Forbidding Airlines from Imposing Ridiculous (FAIR) 
        Fees Act,'' which would prohibit airlines from charging 
        unreasonable fees: www.markey

        chaos-senators-markey-blumenthal-reps-cohen-garcia-khanna-
        reintroduce-legislation-to-ground-airlines-skyrocketing-fees

  <bullet> The ``Families Fly Together Act,'' to ensure that passengers 
        do not have to pay fees to ensure children under 13 are seated 
        with their families: www.markey

        and-airlines-fail-flyers-senator-markey-introduces-families-
        fly-together-act-so-parents-dont-pay-to-sit-with-their-children

  <bullet> The ``Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act,'' which 
        would force airlines to pay cash refunds when they cancel 
        flights: https://raskin.house.gov/2023/2/raskin-markey-
        blumenthal-and-cohen-reintroduce-cash-refunds-for-flight-
        cancellations-act-to-protect-rights-of-airline-passengers

    Second, any further consolidation of the industry should be halted. 
AELP strongly opposes the proposed merger of JetBlue Airways and Spirit 
Airlines, because it will eradicate the Nation's largest Ultra Low Cost 
Carrier (ULCC), drive up fares nationwide, and position JetBlue not to 
fight the Big Four but to expand the oligopoly into the Big Five. We 
applaud the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation 
for opposing this harmful acquisition. According to the DOJ: ``Spirit 
estimates that when it starts flying a route, average fares fall by 17 
percent; JetBlue estimates that when Spirit stops flying a route, 
average fares go up by 30 percent.'' In fact, last year AELP called for 
the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission to impose a moratorium on ALL 
airline mergers until the widespread negative effects of all this 
consolidation can finally be examined by the DOJ and DOT.\9\ Third, 
state governments and citizens should be given greater rights to police 
the industry. One of the most harmful byproducts of deregulation was 
the inclusion of a Federal preemption clause, which effectively gave 
only Congress and the U.S. Department of Transportation authority to 
oversee the airlines. For 45 years this has meant that state courts, 
state attorneys general, and state legislatures have been largely 
powerless in reigning in the excesses of the industry's anti-
competitive greed and mistreatment of passengers, and consumers have 
had fewer rights when interacting with airlines than they have with 
virtually any other consumer industry. AELP has drafted model 
legislation calling for the elimination of preemption, and we're 
working with Members to see that it will soon be introduced as part of 
this year's FAA Reauthorization Act.\10\

    Fourth, we need to fundamentally reconsider our approach to 
regulating the airline industry. Blocking further consolidation in the 
industry and providing passengers with greater legal recourse are 
certainly improvements, but they do not attack the root causes of the 
problem. The airline industry faces such immense incentives for 
consolidation that blocking a single merger, or five mergers, will not 
solve. And airlines likewise exist in an unstable market environment 
that gives them strong incentives to take advantage of, abuse, and rip 
off consumers. Any farsighted policy solution needs to eliminate these 
underlying incentives in the industry, rather than put a Band-Aid on 
the problems that they cause. This means seriously reconsidering 
options to more comprehensively regulate the industry once again.

from the Committee.

            STATEMENT OF DIANA L. MOSS, PRESIDENT, 
                  AMERICAN ANTITRUST INSTITUTE

    Dr. Moss. Thank you. Chair Cantwell and Duckworth, and 
Ranking Members Cruz and Moran, and members of the Committee. 
It is an honor to be here today to lend the American Antitrust 
Institute's perspective to consumer protection and connectivity 
in the U.S. air transportation system.
    My testimony approaches this important issue through the 
lens of competition and how more, not less, is the best vehicle 
for protecting consumers. It makes the case for why we need 
both, strong antitrust enforcement, and coherent regulatory 
policy working together to get there.
    The trend toward concentration in the U.S. airline markets 
continues. There have been almost 20 mergers involving domestic 
carriers in the last two decades, six of which have involved 
mergers of major legacy and low-cost carriers. Two recent 
merger proposals have been made, Spirit and Frontier, which was 
aborted last year. JetBlue and Spirit, which was recently 
challenged by the U.S. Department of Justice.
    And a joint venture codeshare between American and JetBlue, 
otherwise known as the Northeast Alliance, where we await a 
decision on the legality of the codeshare in Federal Court. The 
last 20 years have been marked by the sequential elimination of 
competing airlines, mounting antitrust concerns, and no 
meaningful greenfield entry of new carriers. Today, the sector 
is dominated by a tight oligopoly of carriers.
    A common justification for airline mergers and joint 
ventures is to bulk up to compete better against other large 
rivals. This has never been a valid legal basis for allowing 
any merger under U.S. antitrust law.
    It puts air passenger service markets on the slippery slope 
of rising concentration and higher barriers to entry to smaller 
rivals. Recent proposals would further erode competition to the 
detriment of consumers.
    My written testimony addresses the four major issues, four 
major following issues. First, a loss of competition in 
passenger markets affects airfares and ancillary fees, but it 
also affects quality of service. As an important non-price 
dimension of competition, quality has only recently gained 
attention, but more is needed on how consolidation reduces 
competitive pressures for carriers to maintain and enhance 
quality.
    This includes metrics such as on time performance, 
minimization of delays and cancellations, minimization of 
consumer complaints, and transparency in airfare distribution. 
Second, airline consolidation is unlikely to produce enhanced 
connectivity for travelers. Airlines often promise enhanced 
connectivity, such as new or more frequent service offerings on 
combined networks. But analysis shows that these claims do not 
always materialize. In fact, some mergers actually create 
inefficiencies.
    Third, competition is essential for consumer choice and the 
stability and resiliency of the passenger air system. 
Consolidation threatens diversity of carriers to serve, for 
example, consumers who are price sensitive and for whom bundled 
fare fee low-cost models are ideal.
    A less competitive air transportation system is less likely 
to withstand shocks, such as pandemic and extreme weather, or 
to recover quickly from them. Finally, promoting competition 
and protecting consumers requires strong antitrust enforcement 
and coordinated regulatory oversight.
    While antitrust enforcement in the airline industry appears 
to be on the uptick, regulatory policy has lagged behind. AAI 
has advocated for major regulatory overhauls at DOT to create 
coherent competition policy that bootstrap stronger 
enforcement.
    This includes revisiting DOT's policy approach to approving 
joint ventures and granting immunity. Immunize joint ventures 
not only affect competition on international routes, but also 
on behind the gateway routes to smaller domestic destinations.
    Another priority should be to redesign the FAA's slot 
allocation program to more efficiently allocate takeoff and 
landing slots at congested airports. Slots are critical for 
smaller and newer carriers to enter markets to serve smaller 
destinations.
    Common use gates at airports are also a potential tool for 
promoting competition and spurring entry by smaller rivals. 
Finally, further consolidation could well result in the loss of 
important hubs that provide consumers with access to air 
transportation.
    Past mergers have resulted in the de-hubbing of important 
parts of the U.S., such as the Midwest, with the loss of 
Memphis, Cleveland, and Saint Louis. It is vital that service 
to smaller communities be maintained as part of a competitive 
air system. AAI appreciates the opportunity to testify at this 
important hearing, and I look forward to your questions.

I. Summary of Major Issues
    My testimony addresses the following major issues:

  <bullet> A loss of competition in passenger air transportation 
        markets affects airfares and ancillary fees and quality of 
        service. As an important non-price metric of competition, the 
        quality of products and services has only recently gained 
        attention by antitrust enforcers. More attention should be paid 
        to how consolidation in the U.S. passenger air transportation 
        markets reduces competitive pressure to maintain and enhance 
        quality of service.

  <bullet> Airline mergers and joint ventures are unlikely to produce 
        enhanced ``connectivity'' for travelers. U.S. air carriers have 
        long justified proposed mergers and joint ventures on the basis 
        of enhanced consumer benefits, or the ability of merged 
        carriers to offer new or more frequent service on combined 
        networks. But analysis shows these claims do not always 
        materialize and, in fact, some mergers actually create 
        inefficiency.

  <bullet> Competition is essential for consumer choice and the 
        stability and resiliency of the passenger air transportation 
        system. Consolidation in U.S. passenger air transportation 
        markets has reduced choice for consumers. This means fewer 
        options for consumers who want to purchase service that meets 
        their needs. An air transportation system that features fewer 
        rivals is also less likely to withstand shocks such as pandemic 
        and extreme weather and to recover quickly from them.

  <bullet> Promoting competition and protecting consumers requires 
        strong antitrust enforcement and coordinated regulatory 
        oversight. Historically, there has been less coordination on 
        airline competition matters such as mergers, joint ventures, 
        and slot allocation between the U.S. Department of Justice 
        (DOJ) and Department of Transportation (DOT). Coordination 
        across these two prongs of government is essential for 
        promoting competition and protecting consumers.
II. Introduction
    The trend toward concentration in U.S. airline markets continues. 
There have been almost 20 mergers involving domestic carriers in the 
last two decades, six of which have involved mergers of major legacy or 
low-cost carriers (LCCs) or ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs).\3\ This 
period of time has been marked by the sequential elimination of 
competing airlines, mounting antitrust concerns in passenger air 
transportation markets, and no meaningful greenfield entry of new 
carriers. Today, the U.S. passenger airline system is dominated by a 
tight oligopoly of carriers, with a small fringe of LCCs and ULCCs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A common justification for airline mergers and joint ventures is to 
bulk up to compete better against other large competitors.\4\ This has 
never been a valid legal or economic rationale for allowing any merger 
under U.S. antitrust law. Moreover, it puts passenger air service 
markets on the slippery slope of ever-rising concentration and erects 
barriers to entry to new, smaller rivals. Recent proposed mergers and 
joint venture agreements, including the mergers of Frontier-Spirit and 
JetBlue-Spirit, and the American-JetBlue codeshare (the ``Northeast 
Alliance'') would further erode competition, to the detriment of 
consumers and workers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Procompetitive Benefits of Combination with Spirit, JetBlue (Mar. 6,

lease-details/2023/JetBlue-Releases-Analysis-Further-Demonstrating-
Procompetitive-Benefits-of-Combination-with-Spirit/default.aspx.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    These deals threaten higher airfares and ancillary fees, lower 
quality of service and less innovation, and less choice for consumers; 
and lower wages and less bargaining power for airline workforces. The 
further loss of competition through mergers and joint venture 
agreements is also likely to reduce the stability and resiliency of the 
air transportation system by eliminating redundancy and diversity of 
carriers.
    Antitrust concerns over the harmful effects of consolidation are on 
the rise. For example, the DOJ filed suit against United and Delta in 
2015, alleging the illegal acquisition of takeoff and landing slots at 
Newark's Liberty International Airport.\5\ The DOJ also filed suit 
against American and JetBlue in 2021, alleging that the carriers' 
Northeast Alliance codeshare agreement violated Section 1 of the 
Sherman Act.\6\ Finally, the DOJ filed suit in March 2023 to block the 
merger of JetBlue and Spirit, alleging that the merger would eliminate 
head-to-head competition, facilitate anticompetitive coordination, and 
reduce consumer choice.\7\ Private antitrust class actions have also 
been brought against U.S. carriers, including the 2010 case involving 
anticompetitive collusion on baggage fees between then low-cost-
carriers Southwest and AirTran.\8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    High and rising market concentration is the root of the competitive 
concerns in the foregoing antitrust cases. Dominant carriers and 
oligopolies of carriers have strong incentives to protect their 
dominant positions and to coordinate to keep capacity tight and 
airfares and fees high, respectively. Preventing further increases in 
market concentration that hurts consumers and workers, and jeopardizes 
the stability and resiliency of the passenger air transportation system 
will require a coordinated response by legislators, enforcers, and 
regulators. Such a response, which should have been implemented years 
ago, should be a high priority for Federal and state governments.
III. A Loss of Competition in Passenger Air Transportation Markets 
        Affects Airfares and Ancillary Fees and Quality of Service
    Airline mergers and joint ventures affect competition in two major 
ways. One is the elimination of head-to-head competition between 
merging or joint venture carriers. A second is stronger incentives for 
the remaining carriers in the market to coordinate, rather that 
compete. Both of these competitive effects result in a range of adverse 
price and non-price effects. For example, on routes where mergers and 
joint ventures eliminate a head-to-head competitor or result in a 
smaller number of carriers on the routes, airfares are likely to rise. 
For mergers involving ULCs or ULCCs, which use a bundled model with 
separate ancillary fees for baggage, priority boarding, and other 
services, eliminating competition will put upward pressure on those 
fees.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ See, e.g., Letter from the American Antitrust Institute to the 
Honorable Jonathan Kanter, Re: Antitrust Review of the Spirit Airlines-
Frontier Airlines Merger, American Antitrust Inst. (Apr. 5, 2022), at 
Sec. IV.A., https://www.antitrustinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/
04/
AAI_Spirit_Frontier_ Letter-to-DOJ_4.5.22.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The stepwise elimination of competition in passenger air 
transportation markets over the last two decades has also raised 
questions around the degradation in quality of service. Adverse effects 
result from, for example, less competitive pressure to quickly and 
smoothly integrate the systems of merging carriers, including 
information technology, labor workforces, frequent flyer programs, and 
aircraft configurations. Evidence from previous airline mergers 
indicates that combining airline systems post-merger has been expensive 
and protracted. For example, U.S. Airways explained in 2006 that ``The 
integration of U.S. Airways Group and America West Holdings has been 
and will continue to be costly, complex and time consuming, and 
management will continue to devote substantial effort to that 
integration and may have its attention diverted from ongoing 
operational matters or other strategic opportunities.''21 United-
Continental also struggled with system integration post-merger, 
problems that directly affected quality of service and caused 
significant public backlash.
    A loss of competition also reduces competitive pressure on carriers 
to maintain or enhance quality post-merger. This increases consumer 
search costs and inconvenience and degrades the passenger experience. 
Mergers and joint ventures that combine: (1) ULCCs with poor-quality 
records, or (2) mixed models such as a ULCC and full-service carrier, 
increase the risk that quality deteriorate post-consolidation. For 
example, AAI examined the service quality records of Spirit and

    \11\ AAI research shows that ULCs have historically had the most 
delays. For example, over the period 2004-2013, regional carriers saw a 
slight decline in delays, hub-and-spoke carriers showed an 11 percent 
increase in delays, but low-cost carriers showed a 47 percent increase 
in delays. See, Diana L. Moss, Delivering the Benefits? Efficiencies

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The elimination of competition between Spirit and Frontier, should 
the carriers have merged, would likely have exacerbated their history 
of poor service quality performance, to the detriment of consumers. It 
is vital, therefore, that antitrust enforcement and sector regulation 
look carefully at how airline competition affects the price and non-
price dimensions of competition.
IV. Airline Mergers and Joint Ventures Are Unlikely to Produce Enhanced 
        ``Connectivity'' for Travelers
    There are two categories of benefits or ``efficiencies'' that are 
typically offered by airlines seeking to justify mergers, joint 
ventures, and requests for antitrust immunity for alliances. One 
category is cost savings that are projected to result from integrating 
information systems, better utilization of gate space and other 
facilities such as hangars and leaseholds, and increased operational 
efficiency. A second category of efficiencies is network benefits from 
post-merger capacity management and enhanced connectivity for 
consumers. There are a number of potential sources of network benefits: 
adding destinations to the combined network, offering more round-trip 
options on existing routes, converting interline service into single 
line service, optimizing the combined fleet of aircraft across a larger 
network, and scheduling improvements.
    Efficiencies from airline consolidation have been the focus of 
considerable analysis and growing skepticism. As one expert summed up a 
decade ago: ``It is pretty difficult looking at the U.S. airline 
industry [to believe] that mergers are actually going to lower costs. 
There is no evidence that they deliver more cost-efficiency.'' \12\ 
Claims of network benefits are viewed even more skeptically. A number 
of factors create a highly fluid landscape, against which efficiencies 
claims become highly uncertain. These include: (1) different economics 
of hub-and-spoke networks operated by the legacy network carriers and 
the point-to-point networks operated by ULCs and ULCCs, (2) entry and 
exit into route-level markets, (3) strategic pricing by other carriers, 
and (4) profitability of routes.

not yet one happy family, DenverPost.com (Sept. 8, 2013), http://
www.denverpost.com/business/ci_24036565/united-airlines-is-one-big-
company-but-not.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There are three major examples that undercut claims that airline 
consolidation improves connectivity and benefits consumers. First, 
analysis of past airline mergers reveals that network benefits from 
increased connectivity after the Delta-Northwest, United-Continental, 
and Southwest-AirTran mergers did not fully materialize. Indeed, 
airlines cut airport-pairs from their systems post-merger and ULCs cut 
a substantially higher percentage than did legacy airlines.\13\ More 
recently, AAI analyzed claims of network benefits from combining the 
Spirit and Frontier networks. Changes in entry and exit on routes 
between 2015 and 2021 showed that the carriers exited more than 50 
percent of routes and entered only 35-40 percent of routes.\14\ This 
high rate of churn in the Spirit and Frontier route systems strongly 
suggests that the carriers would still have engaged in rapid entry and 
exit from route-level markets had they merged, undercutting claims of 
long-term enhanced connectivity.

Sec. III.C.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The economic reality is that airlines will only enter and remain in 
markets when they are profitable. Otherwise, they will exit routes. 
This fact casts significant doubt on claims that post-merger, carriers 
will increase long-term connectivity for consumers. Southwest Airlines 
confirmed this in 2011 at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the 
Southwest-AirTran merger. There, Senator Kohl asked Southwest's CEO 
Gary Kelly: ``Would you at this time commit to maintaining AirTran's 
service and its growth plans at Mitchell Airport after this merger 
takes place? Mr. Kelly responded: ``Mr. Chairman, we are very enthused 
about Milwaukee. We are very enthused about continuing to grow 
Southwest Airlines . . . I just cannot guarantee that we will have the 
fiscal ability to do that.'' \15\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Second, past airline consolidation has resulted in the ``de-
hubbing'' of cities in the hub-and-spoke networks of the legacy 
airlines. High profile examples of hub cutbacks include Cincinnati 
(Delta) where scheduled departures between 2007 and 2021 declined by 63 
percent, Cleveland (Continental) with a 25 percent decrease, Memphis 
(Northwest), with a 35 percent decrease, Pittsburgh (US Airways), with 
a 40 percent decrease, and St. Louis (American), with a 25 percent 
decrease.\16\ The de-hubbing of the Midwest has had material impacts on 
the accessibility of passenger air service for a major segment of the 
U.S., with outsized effects on smaller communities where consumers are 
forced to travel greater distances to access airports.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Third, the DOT has approved numerous airline joint venture 
alliances involving carrier cooperation on activities such as: 
interlining with carrier partners, sharing frequent flyer programs, 
codesharing, coordinating pricing and schedules, and fully integrated, 
immunized revenue and profit-sharing joint-venture type 
coordination.\17\ Immunity for airline alliances is a form of express 
statutory immunity that is granted by DOT under its public interest 
standard, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. Sec. 41308-309. There are currently 25 
active immunized alliances.\18\ Alliance carriers support requests for 
immunity by asserting, among other things, that passengers benefit from 
integrating itineraries on connecting routes, thus enhancing 
competition in behind-or beyond-the-gateway segments and lowering 
fares.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    However, recent economic studies of the benefits cast doubt on the 
benefits of immunity.\19\ For example, immunity may lead to less 
competition--on non-stop and one-stop routes--in transatlantic 
markets.\20\ Moreover, while immunized JVs may increase capacity at 
hubs, it comes at the expense of services elsewhere in the network.\21\ 
When alliance carriers compete with a non-alliance interlining carrier, 
the latter are foreclosed, increasing disparities in market share and 
decreasing interlining traffic.\22\ The evidence on the costs and 
benefits of immunity highlights how consolidation and coordination can 
decrease connectivity for consumers and why DOT should take a more 
cautious approach to granting immunity.

V. Competition is Essential for Consumer Choice and the Stability and 
        Resiliency of the Passenger Air Transportation System
    Competition is essential to enable consumers to choose air service 
that meets their needs and pocketbooks, as well as for promoting the 
stability and resiliency of the passenger air transportation system. 
Past consolidation has eroded these important features of competition 
in the passenger air transportation system. As air travel has become 
more accessible to different segments of consumers, the industry has 
satisfied different types of demand with different business models and 
pricing structures. The legacy airlines still adhere primarily to a 
full-service model, with integrated pricing for air service and 
ancillary services. The ULCC model (e.g., Spirit and Frontier) features 
unbundling of ancillary fees (e.g., baggage, boarding, seat selection, 
etc.) from fares as part of a ``fare+fee'' model. JetBlue offers a 
hybrid, LLC and full-service, model.
    The DOJ's recent lawsuit challenging the merger of JetBlue and 
Spirit focuses on effects that are central to the importance of 
maintaining a diverse system of carriers. For example, the complaint 
alleges that the elimination of Spirit--one of two national ULCCs--
would make it easier for remaining rivals to coordinate on price and 
capacity.\23\ But the complaint also alleged that the elimination of 
Spirit reduces important choice for consumers. In its letter to the DOJ 
on the proposed merger of Spirit and Frontier, AAI emphasized that the 
merger would lessen pressure on the merging parties to compete on 
ancillary fees under their fare+fee model, harming consumers that are 
particularly price sensitive.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \23\ DOJ Complaint in JetBlue-Spirit, supra note 7.
    \24\ AAI letter to DOJ on Spirit-Frontier, supra note 9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It is also clear that competition is necessary for the stability 
and resiliency of the passenger air service system. For example, early 
in the COVID-19 pandemic, disruption threatened and immobilized 
critical supply chains and systems. Many of these supply chains were 
marked by a lack of competition, creating bottlenecks and a lack of 
stability in the system that had serious consequences for consumer 
welfare, safety, and security.\25\ Supply chains that feature robust 
competition at various levels are far more likely to ensure the 
reliable and stable distribution of products and services because there 
are more competitors working to fill the void.

supply-chains/#_ftn4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The wave of consolidation that fundamentally reshaped the passenger 
air system in the U.S. over the last two decades has likely reduced the 
ability of the system to withstand external shocks. For example, the 
COVID-19 pandemic created shortages of pilots, crews, and other 
workforces while the industry struggled with plummeting demand and 
lower revenues.
    Fewer carriers, loss of competitive redundancy on routes, and 
higher barriers to entry for smaller entrants contribute to less 
resiliency in the system to withstand disruption. And in late December 
2022, extreme weather created a cascading failure on the Southwest 
Airlines system.\26\ The airline cancelled a significant percentage of 
flights, relative to other legacy, ULC, and ULCC carriers, stranding 
travelers and creating wider system disruption.\27\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    These examples of disruption to the passenger air transportation 
system highlight the importance of maintaining a diversity of carriers 
and competition between carriers. Mergers that eliminate competition 
between carriers with similar business models (e.g., legacy or ULCC) or 
between carriers with similar network models (e.g., hub-and-spoke or 
point to point) eliminate important diversity and competition that is 
essential for maintaining stability and resiliency in the passenger air 
system.
VI. Promoting Competition and Protecting Consumers Requires Strong 
        Antitrust Enforcement and Coordinated Regulatory Oversight
    While antitrust enforcement in the U.S. airline industry appears to 
be on the uptick, regulatory policy has not kept up with promoting 
competition. With a looser and often liberally interpreted public 
interest standard, the DOT has approved dozens of joint ventures that 
eliminate competition, blessing many of them with antitrust immunity so 
carriers engage, without impunity, in anticompetitive coordination, to 
the detriment of consumers.
    Nor has DOT stepped in to block airline mergers. It is, therefore, 
more important than ever for the two prongs of a public policy approach 
to promoting competition in airline markets to work together.
    AAI has advocated for major regulatory overhauls at DOT to create 
coherent competition policy that bootstraps stronger antitrust 
enforcement in the airline sector. First, DOT's policy approach to 
approving joint venture agreements should be re-evaluated.\28\ AAI has 
advocated for measures that recognize the increasingly high hurdle for 
justifying grants of antitrust immunity for joint ventures that 
eliminate head-to-head competition in exchange for amorphous benefits 
elsewhere in alliance networks. This higher level of scrutiny and 
vigilance should also extend to cooperative service agreements and 
codeshares. AAI urges DOT to consider a more robust process and 
specific criteria for making its public interest determinations in 
these cases.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Second, Federal regulatory policy should focus on approaches that 
recognize the reality of the oligopoly of carriers that dominates the 
U.S. landscape. While the Federal Aviation Administration's initiatives 
on the slot allocation program is a move in the right direction, the 
difficulty faced by smaller carriers in securing slots at congested 
airports, which facilitate entry and competitive discipline, indicates 
the need to overhaul the slot administration system. AAI encourages DOT 
to consider a rulemaking to develop a new model and market design for 
slot allocation that will result in more efficient outcomes and control 
for market power. Common use gates at airports also increase ease of 
access by smaller rivals, and prevent hoarding of critical inputs by 
dominant players or tight oligopolies of carriers. AAI thus encourages 
the DOT to consider initiatives that create more access through such a 
program.
VII. Conclusions
    AAI appreciates the opportunity to testify at this important 
hearing. We stand ready to assist the Committee members, DOT, DOJ, and 
state-level agencies in crafting ways to improve inter-agency 
coordination to promote competition in the passenger air transportation 
markets, for the benefit of consumers.

        STATEMENT OF HEATHER ANSLEY, ASSOCIATE EXECUTIVE

           DIRECTOR, GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, PARALYZED

                      VETERANS OF AMERICA

    Ms. Ansley. Thank you, Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, 
Chair Duckworth, and Ranking Member Moran, and members of the 
Committee. Paralyzed Veterans of America thanks you for holding 
this important hearing to consider the experience of air travel 
passengers in the development of the next FAA reauthorization.
    The Air Carrier Access Act, or ACAA, was signed nearly 40 
years ago and prohibits disability-based discrimination in air 
travel. Unfortunately, the air travel experience of passengers 
with disabilities, particularly for those who use wheelchairs, 
is at best frustrating and at worst it is unsafe.
    PVA's President Charles Brown fractured his tailbone in 
2019 when he was dropped in the aircraft boarding process. As a 
result of his injuries, he spent months in a VA medical center. 
He is lucky to be alive.
    Unfortunately, his story is not unique. Multiple disability 
organizations led by PVA conducted a survey following the 35th 
anniversary of the air carrier law. Many wheelchair users 
reported that the narrow aisle chairs they must use to board 
into planes are difficult or unsafe to use.
    In fact, 16 percent of respondents reported having been 
dropped, just like Mr. Brown, and 23 percent reported having 
been injured in the process. Nearly 70 percent of wheelchair 
and scooter users reported having their device damaged by an 
airline. Furthermore, almost 56 percent said that their device 
had been delayed and 17 percent reported it had been lost. When 
problems occur, passengers have few options.
    Although the last FAA reauthorization allowed the 
Department of Transportation to assess triple the amount of the 
allowable fine for wheelchair damage or injury to a passenger 
with a disability, the Department has yet to assess any fines 
under this provision.
    Despite a significant focus in the last reauthorization on 
improving the safety and dignity of passengers with 
disabilities, the needle has barely moved. In fact, the 
percentage of wheelchairs and scooters mishandled in 2022 was 
the same percent as those lost, damaged or delayed in 2019.
    Unlike trains, busses, and other transportation vehicles 
regulated by the Americans with Disabilities Act, aircraft have 
very few, if any, features to facilitate access by passengers 
with disabilities. There is no guaranteed path of travel to 
allow a wheelchair user to board the plane. There is no 
designated wheelchair secure area for them to fly while seated 
in their device.
    No accessible lavatory on the vast majority of single aisle 
aircraft, and limited or no communications accessible to those 
who are deaf or blind. We strongly believe that the Air Carrier 
Access Amendments Act must be included in the next FAA 
reauthorization to provide a safe and dignified air travel 
experience for passengers with disabilities. This legislation 
would require airlines to operate aircraft that meet basic 
accessibility standards and improve enforcement of the law.
    Specifically, the Amendments Act would require the 
Secretary of Transportation, through direct consultation with 
the U.S. Access Board, to formulate disability access standards 
for aircraft. Needed standards are as simple as including a 
path of travel to allow a wheelchair user to board in their own 
device and roll to a designated passenger seat, most likely at 
the front of the aircraft, and then transfer into that 
passenger's seat, or fly from their chair if that is deemed 
technologically feasible.
    This would allow wheelchair users to avoid using an aisle 
chair for boarding and deplaning and decrease the possibility 
of injury. In terms of wheelchair stowage, the standards would 
require more options for manual wheelchairs to be stowed inside 
the cabin and ensure that cargo doors and holds allow power 
wheelchairs to be in plane and stowed upright to protect the 
devices from damage and airline workers from injury.
    The Amendments Act would also strengthen enforcement of the 
law by requiring the Department of Transportation to levy civil 
penalties in situations such as physical harm to a disabled 
passenger or a damage to a wheelchair, and to refer certain 
complaints to the Department of Justice.
    The legislation would also restore the ability of 
passengers with disabilities to have their rights protected by 
the courts. Increased aircraft accessibility and improved 
enforcement options will lead to a safer travel experience for 
disabled veterans and other people with disabilities who have 
waited decades for safe access to air travel.
    The time to act is now. In closing, I also want to note our 
support for including provisions in the reauthorization that 
would require greater analysis and aggregation of wheelchair 
mishandling data to look for trends and facilitate development 
of solutions, improved access to seating accommodations, 
increased flight options at no additional cost if a passenger's 
wheelchair cannot be stowed on their aircraft, and continued 
research on the technical and economic feasibility of airlines 
in implementing in-cabin wheelchair restraint systems.
    We sincerely thank you for the opportunity to present our 
views and would be happy to answer any questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Ansley follows:]

  Prepared Statement of Heather Ansley, Associate Executive Director, 
          Government Relations, Paralyzed Veterans of America
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and members of the Committee, 
Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) thanks you for holding this 
important hearing to consider the experience of air travel passengers 
in the development of the next reauthorization of the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA). PVA, a congressionally chartered veterans service 
organization, serves veterans who have incurred a spinal cord injury or 
disorder. The vast majority of our members use wheelchairs or other 
assistive devices for mobility and have a strong interest in ensuring 
that commercial air travel is safe and dignified for all passengers 
with disabilities.
    Almost 40 years ago, President Ronald Reagan signed the Air Carrier 
Access Act (ACAA) into law. The ACAA prohibits disability-based 
discrimination in air travel and requires air carriers to provide 
accessibility for and accommodations to passengers with disabilities. 
PVA led the advocacy efforts for passage of the law based on the 
experiences our members encountered while traveling by air, including 
being refused passage simply because of their disability. Four years 
after the passage of the ACAA, Congress passed another PVA-supported 
bill, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Although the ADA 
requires disability access in airports, shuttles, and other forms of 
mass transportation, it does not apply to commercial air travel.
    The ACAA advanced equal opportunity for passengers with 
disabilities. It required air carriers to provide passengers with 
disabilities the opportunity to preboard, if additional time or 
assistance is needed to board the aircraft; timely assistance in 
boarding and deplaning; proper stowage of assistive devices; and 
appropriate seating accommodations. After decades of discrimination in 
air travel, the passage of the ACAA gave hope to passengers with 
disabilities that their air travel experience would improve.
    Despite the ACAA's protections, the current air travel experience 
for passengers with disabilities, particularly wheelchair users, is, at 
best, frustrating and, at worse, unsafe. Wheelchair users must 
surrender their customized wheelchair for stowage either in cargo or, 
in the case of certain manual wheelchairs, the cabin. The passenger 
must then be transferred to an aisle chair that allows them to enter 
the aircraft and traverse the aircraft's aisle, which is very often 
narrower than the passenger being pushed through it. Aisle chairs are 
devices designed solely to navigate the narrow aisle. The chairs are 
often too small for the individual, have limited padding, cannot be 
propelled by the user, and are prone to tipping. Once on the aisle 
chair, the passenger is then maneuvered backwards onto the aircraft and 
pulled down the aisle to the passenger seat. The struggle then begins 
anew to transfer the passenger from the aisle chair to the seat within 
the tight confines of the cabin.
    Throughout the boarding and deplaning process, passengers are 
assisted by airline staff or, more frequently, their contractors. Many 
of these individuals have limited training, are unable to effectively 
communicate with passengers, and are required to lift and transfer 
individuals with significant disabilities without sufficient staffing 
and other resources. The boarding and deplaning process does not 
protect the health and safety of passengers with disabilities. Instead, 
it is unsafe, and regularly results in passengers receiving, at the 
very least, bumps and bruises and, in other cases, far more significant 
injuries.
    Unlike mass transportation vehicles regulated by the ADA, aircraft 
have very few, if any, features to facilitate access by passengers with 
disabilities. There is no guaranteed path of travel to allow a 
wheelchair user to board the plane, no specially designated area for 
them to fly while seated in their wheelchair, no wheelchair accessible 
lavatory on the vast majority of single-aisle aircraft, and limited or 
no communications accessible to those who are deaf or blind.
    The lack of accessibility features has resulted in significant 
safety issues for passengers with disabilities, particularly wheelchair 
users. PVA's President, who lives in Florida, was severely injured four 
years ago when he was dropped while attempting to board an aircraft. He 
fractured his tail bone as a result of this incident and subsequently 
developed skin breakdown and a bone infection. As a result of his 
injuries, he spent several months inpatient at a VA medical center.
    PVA's Immediate Past President, who lives in Washington, testified 
before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Aviation 
Subcommittee in 2019 about a time when he had severely injured his hip 
and needed to fly for PVA business. As he boarded the plane using an 
aisle chair, his knee hit nearly every armrest on the way back to his 
seat. He recalled that each time he hit his knee that the jolt sent 
pain radiating to his injured hip.
    Earlier this month, another PVA member from Washington state 
attended PVA's Advocacy Legislation Seminar in Washington, DC. On his 
return trip, his power wheelchair was damaged. Specifically, the 
controller arm was broken and his backup camera was missing. It took 
three hours at baggage claim for personnel to find someone who knew how 
to file the damage report. The third-party contractor handling the 
repair acted quickly once the claim was filed and the first adjuster 
came to see the damage within a couple of days. However, it has now 
been well over a week and he is still waiting for the parts needed to 
fix the damage. In the meantime, when he takes his hand off of the 
wheelchair's joy stick, it swings out of position.
    Another PVA member, the national director from PVA's Texas Chapter, 
will no longer travel by air. She first traveled post-injury to an 
adaptive sporting event. On the trip from San Antonio to Aspen, her 
left shoulder was injured on one of the transfers to the aisle chair 
due to airline assistants incorrectly strapping her to it. During the 
return trip, on one of the transfers from the aisle chair to the 
airline seat, she received a large abrasion on the bottom side of her 
thigh. On her second and last airline trip, she arrived at her 
destination to find that her 450-pound power wheelchair did not work. 
She and her broken chair had to be pushed so that she could leave the 
airport. Until she can drive her wheelchair onto a plane and lock it 
into place and be safe, she and her husband, who serves as her 
caregiver, will not use airline transportation and instead drive 
wherever they need to travel.
    These anecdotal reports were validated by the results of a survey 
conducted by multiple disability organizations, led by PVA, following 
the 35th anniversary of the ACAA.\1\ Over 1,200 individuals responded 
to the survey, which covered a wide variety of accommodations for 
passengers with disabilities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Many respondents reported that even though they traveled by air 
they were very concerned about encountering physical barriers. The top 
reason to avoid air travel was concerns about wheelchair damage. 
Respondents also reported they were fearful that they would not be 
safely transferred from their wheelchair to the aisle chair and into 
the passenger seat and vice versa.
    When an airline damages, loses, or delays a passenger's wheelchair, 
it is a significant and serious problem that endangers their health and 
limits their mobility and independence. In the worst cases, it can mean 
the end of the trip as the individual is forced to stay in a hotel bed 
while they wait for the repair of their wheelchair. It can also mean 
weeks or months of having to use their own damaged wheelchair or an 
ill-fitting loaned wheelchair. Following her personal wheelchair being 
severely damaged on a flight, disability advocate Engracia Figueroa was 
forced to use an ill-fitting wheelchair that resulted in medical 
complications that led to her untimely death in October 2021, three 
months after her trip.
    Nearly 70 percent of survey respondents who travel with a 
wheelchair or scooter reported having it damaged by the carrier. 
Furthermore, almost 56 percent said that their wheelchair or scooter 
has been delayed. Seventeen percent reported having their wheelchair or 
scooter lost.
    The 2018 FAA Reauthorization required the U.S. Department of 
Transportation (DOT) to implement within 60 days of passage a 
requirement for large domestic air carriers to submit monthly reports 
on the number of wheelchairs and scooters they enplane and the number 
subsequently mishandled (lost, damaged, or delayed). Between 2019 and 
2022, over 32,000 wheelchairs and scooters were mishandled by airlines. 
Each one of these situations represents a person whose life was 
disrupted or impeded until their device was repaired, located, or 
replaced.
    Over half of survey respondents needed to board and deplane using 
an aisle chair. Many reported that aisle chairs are difficult or unsafe 
to use. In fact, 16 percent of respondents reported being dropped and 
23 percent reported being injured in the boarding and deplaning 
process. One passenger said, ``the attendants rarely know how to 
transfer or to strap me in.''
    Not being able to use the restroom during a flight ranked high on 
the list of reasons survey respondents avoided air travel. In fact, 
lack of lavatory access, even on a cross country flight, was reason 
enough for nearly 60 percent of respondents to avoid air travel unless 
absolutely necessary. The 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act required the 
U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study lavatory access on 
aircraft, including access for passengers with disabilities. GAO found 
that although accessible lavatories are available, ``carriers do not 
often choose to acquire them.'' \2\ In 2019, of the top eight domestic 
air carriers, only 4.5 percent of their single-aisle aircraft had 
accessible lavatories. Four of these carriers had no accessible 
lavatories in their fleets.

products/gao-20-258.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    After years of delay, nearly 40 years after the ACAA became law, 
DOT appears to be in the final stages of publishing a rule requiring 
larger single-aisle aircraft to have an accessible lavatory. Finally, 
passengers with mobility impairments and those who need the assistance 
of a caregiver would be able to enter a lavatory using an onboard 
wheelchair with an assistant and close the door. Nearly seven years 
ago, advocates and the airlines agreed to a rather lengthy timeline, at 
the urging of the carriers, that would require aircraft ordered 18 
years or delivered 20 years after the date of the final rule to have an 
accessible lavatory. Since air carriers have been on notice for over 
six years that this requirement was coming, we believe that as a matter 
of equity DOT should shorten the implementation timeline by the number 
of years this rule has been delayed. Unfortunately, even in a best-case 
scenario, it will still be decades until the requirement is fully 
implemented.
    In the last year, we have continued to hear reports of insufficient 
staffing to perform lifts of passengers during the boarding and 
deplaning process, misplaced wheelchairs that result in injury, broken 
wheelchairs, humiliation due to the lack of bathroom access, and even 
threats to contact law enforcement when passengers refused to deplane 
before their wheelchair was returned to them. An August 2022 New York 
Times article, ``Embarrassing, Uncomfortable and Risky: What Flying is 
Like for Passengers Who Use Wheelchairs,'' \3\ documented the 
difficulties PVA's President experiences when he travels by air.

    There are very few options for passengers who do not receive proper 
disability-related assistance. Passengers often share their frustration 
on social media and may file a complaint with the airline and/or DOT. 
The Department can issue cease and desist orders and levy civil 
penalties for ACAA violations; however, the largest financial penalty 
in recent years was in 2016 for $2 million.\4\ That fine, much of which 
was credited to the carrier, was an anomaly.

passengers filed nearly 42,500 disability-related complaints directly 
with over 185 foreign and domestic airlines, which was an increase of 
nearly 15 percent over 2018. That same year, passengers filed 
approximately 900 disability-related complaints directly with DOT. In 
2021, passengers filed nearly 1,400 DOT complaints. The number of DOT 
complaints filed in 2022 has not yet been released.
    Despite a significant focus in the last FAA Reauthorization on 
improving the safety and dignity of passengers with disabilities, the 
needle has barely moved. In fact, the percentage of wheelchairs and 
scooters mishandled in 2022 was the same percent as those mishandled in 
2019, the first full year for which airlines were required to report 
such numbers.\5\ The safety of passengers with disabilities is at stake 
and Congress must act to bring their air travel experience into the 
21st century.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The problem with commercial air travel is that aircraft do not have 
proper accessibility features to accommodate passengers with 
disabilities. Passengers will continue to be injured and wheelchairs 
delayed, damaged, or lost until travelers can travel onto the plane 
using their personal wheelchair and transfer to a passenger seat or 
stay safely seated in their devices. Commercial air travel has been 
given a pass for far too long under the guise that requiring access 
will require the loss of too much revenue without any regard for the 
price wheelchair users must pay with their bodies during air travel. 
People with disabilities will not be able to effectively compete for 
jobs, vacation with their families, or seek needed medical care until 
safe and dignified air travel is guaranteed for all passengers with 
disabilities.
    We strongly believe that the Air Carrier Access Amendments Act 
(ACAAA) (S. 545) must be included in the next FAA Reauthorization Act 
to improve the air travel experience of passengers with disabilities. 
This critically important legislation, which is currently supported by 
30 veterans, disability, and consumer organizations, would provide safe 
and dignified air travel for passengers with disabilities by requiring 
airlines to operate aircraft that meet accessibility standards and 
improving enforcement of the law.
    Accessibility standards for larger aircraft used in commercial air 
travel are needed to provide a safe and dignified air travel experience 
for wheelchair users. The ACAAA would require the DOT Secretary through 
direct consultation with the U.S. Access Board to formulate standards 
to address effective boarding and deplaning, visually accessible 
announcements, in-flight entertainment, seating accommodations, 
lavatories, and stowage options for assistive devices. Five years after 
the standards are finalized, airlines would need to operate aircraft 
that comply with them.
    Standards related to boarding and deplaning would require 
``ensuring that there is a route accessible for individuals to board 
and deplane the aircraft from their personal assistive devices, 
including wheelchairs.'' We believe this provision would allow a 
wheelchair user to board in their own wheelchair and roll to a 
designated passenger seat, most likely at the front of the aircraft, 
and transfer to the seat. On a majority of larger aircraft, the 
passenger boarding door is already wide enough to allow a wheelchair to 
enter the cabin. The chosen layout of the cabin hinders movement. 
Requiring a proper path of travel would allow wheelchair users to avoid 
using an aisle chair for boarding and deplaning. The standards would 
also include in-cabin wheelchair restraints, if deemed technologically 
feasible.
    The 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act required the U.S. Access Board to 
conduct a study of the feasibility of in-cabin wheelchair restraint 
systems. The Access Board carried out that requirement through the 
National Academy of Sciences' Transportation Research Board (TRB).\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ Transportation Research Board, Technical Feasibility of a 
Wheelchair Securement Concept for Airline Travel: A Preliminary 
Assessment, https://www.access-board.gov/files/research/trb-final-
report-sept2021.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The TRB study was unable to ``identify any issues . . . that seem 
likely to present design and engineering challenges so formidable that 
they call into question the technical feasibility of an in-cabin 
wheelchair securement system and the value of exploring the concept 
further.'' The study acknowledged that further assessment was needed, 
``particularly to understand how secured personal wheelchairs are 
likely to perform relative to FAA's security criteria in restraining 
and protecting occupants during a survivable airplane crash or 
emergency landing,'' and called on DOT and FAA to undertake research on 
these issues. It also called on the Access Board to assess the demand 
from people with disabilities to fly while seated in their wheelchairs 
to inform the number of aircraft that would need to be modified to 
provide meaningful access, assuming remaining feasibility questions are 
satisfied.
    We call on Congress to include language in the next FAA 
Reauthorization directing appropriate agencies and administrations on 
completion of the next milestones, including the economic and financial 
feasibility of airlines implementing in-cabin wheelchair restraint 
systems, and providing funding necessary to accomplish them. We would 
also support inclusion of tax credits or other incentives to facilitate 
expedited adoption by air carriers.
    In terms of wheelchair stowage, the standards would require 
``adequate in-cabin stowage of assistive devices.'' We believe that 
this would allow more types of manual wheelchairs to be stowed in the 
cabin for those who wish to fly while seated in a passenger seat. The 
standards would further require the option for ``proper stowage of 
assistive devices in the cargo and ensure that cargo doors and the 
cargo holds allow such devices to be enplaned and stowed upright.'' 
This change is needed to ensure that when wheelchairs are stowed in 
cargo they can be done so in a way that is safe for airline workers and 
protects the wheelchair from damage.
    Although the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act allowed DOT to assess 
triple the amount of the allowable fine for wheelchair damage or injury 
to a passenger with a disability, the Department has yet to assess any 
fines under this provision. The previously cited complaint data shows 
that the lack of fines levied is not due to a decrease in wheelchair 
damage or passenger complaints. The ACAAA would strengthen enforcement 
of the law by requiring DOT to levy civil penalties for mishandled 
wheelchairs, physical harm to a passenger with a disability, lack of 
proper aisle chair assistance, improperly denied boarding for a 
passenger with a disability, inappropriately denied access for a 
service animal, and gross negligence.
    The ACAAA would also require the DOT Secretary to refer complaints 
to the Department of Justice (DOJ) when there is reasonable cause to 
believe that violations of the law are a pattern or practice or if it 
``raises an issue of general public importance.'' Referral of cases to 
DOJ will put commercial air travel in the same position as other 
providers of mass transportation. It would also recognize that the ACAA 
is not a customer service standard but a civil right. The Attorney 
General would then be able to pursue a civil action on behalf of a 
passenger.
    The legislation would also formally establish a private right of 
action to institute additional remedies, without removing DOT's role in 
the administrative process. Prior to the 2001 Supreme Court case, 
Alexander v. Sandoval,\7\ the Fifth, Eighth, and Ninth Federal Circuit 
Courts recognized a private right of action under the ACAA. In 
Tallarico v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,\8\ a minor with cerebral palsy 
was not permitted to fly unaccompanied. The plaintiff alleged the 
airline violated the ACAA by denying her the right to fly because of 
her physical conditions. The court supported the jury's award of 
emotional distress damages, in the amount of $80,000, but did not 
analyze whether punitive damages could be recovered.\9\ In Tunison v. 
Cont'l Airlines Corp.,\10\ the deaf and blind plaintiff was not allowed 
to fly alone. The court found that the airline violated the ACAA, but 
awarded no damages. After Sandoval, the Second, Fifth, Ninth, Tenth, 
Eleventh, and D.C. Circuit Courts have subsequently ruled that there is 
no private right of action under the ACAA.\11\ Federal preemption 
further hinders access to potential remedies by limiting applicability 
of state law.

    Restoring a private right of action would allow more remedies for 
passengers who suffer ACAA violations. It would also allow for 
injunctive relief to foster policy changes that would allow passengers 
and airlines to partner together to make changes that would benefit all 
people with disabilities. In calling for Congress to pass the ACAAA, an 
editorial from the Las Vegas Sun noted the support major airlines 
received from taxpayers during the COVID pandemic and said, ``If the 
American people are expected to help bail out the airline industry, the 
airline industry should do everything in its power to serve all 
Americans.'' \12\

    We believe that increased aircraft accessibility, and improved 
enforcement options will lead to safer travel experiences for 
passengers with disabilities. PVA members and others with disabilities 
have waited long enough for safe access to air travel. We know how to 
improve the experience of passengers with disabilities. We simply need 
to do it.
    Until wheelchair users are able to board and deplane aircraft using 
their personal wheelchairs and have the option to access an aircraft 
wheelchair space or have their wheelchair safely stowed either in the 
cabin or cargo, air carriers must improve training and provide job aid 
materials for workers. In February 2022, PVA submitted a formal request 
for rulemaking to DOT about the assistance provided to passengers who 
use aisle chairs, information airlines are required to collect related 
to incidents in boarding and deplaning, and how airlines assist 
passengers when a wheelchair or scooter is mishandled. PVA called on 
the Department to require air carriers to have specific personnel who 
are highly trained in transfer techniques and the use of boarding and 
deplaning devices. The training provided to these assistants must be 
``hands on'' and assistants must receive an annual certification of 
their skills, including their ability to follow directions from 
passengers about how to effectively and safely assist them. 
Furthermore, the assistants must be given properly maintained equipment 
that meets standards that address not only the needs of the airline, 
but also the needs of the passenger and the assistants.
    In addition, DOT must require airlines to provide ramp personnel 
with the proper equipment to safely enplane and deplane assistive 
devices. The Department must also establish a timeline for airlines to 
replace or repair a wheelchair or other assistive device or provide 
compensation for a device's damage, as well as requiring air carriers 
to provide adequate interim accommodations. DOT must also clarify that 
the ACAA requires air carriers to return all wheelchairs and other 
assistive devices in the condition in which they were surrendered by 
the passenger.
    DOT has indicated that a proposed rule will be published later this 
year. We ask Congress to include a provision in the FAA Reauthorization 
requiring the Department to complete this rulemaking within one year of 
the Reauthorization's enactment. We also believe that the next FAA 
Reauthorization should require DOT to provide greater analysis and 
aggregation of the wheelchair and scooter data received from airlines, 
including separating incidents related to manual wheelchairs, power 
wheelchairs, and scooters, to look for trends, as well as develop 
solutions to address areas of specific concern focused on attacking the 
root cause of mishandled assistive devices.
    Passengers with disabilities also need improved access to 
appropriate seating accommodations. The ACAA requires airlines to 
accommodate passengers with disabilities only in the class of service 
purchased. Thus, a passenger who purchases an economy ticket is not 
required to be accommodated in premium economy even if seating in that 
section would better accommodate the passenger.
    The next FAA Reauthorization should require airlines to provide a 
passenger with a disability and at least one companion with a needed 
seating accommodation, even if in another class of service, as long as 
no more than one passenger will be displaced in that class of service. 
We believe that passengers with disabilities should not be required to 
pay higher ticket prices simply because they wish to limit their time 
on an aisle chair and the bruises and abrasions they may receive being 
transported to their seat further back in the plane. Air carriers must 
also clearly alert passengers with disabilities about the availability 
of seating accommodation options.
    Furthermore, airlines should be required to accommodate wheelchair 
users on another aircraft, including that of another airline, if the 
passenger's wheelchair will not fit on the aircraft designated for the 
passenger's flight. Wheelchair users should not be forced to pay a 
higher ticket price if the only aircraft type that will accommodate 
their assistive device is used on a more expensive flight. They should 
also not be required to fly on an airline that is more expensive solely 
because that airline uses an aircraft that will accommodate the 
passenger's wheelchair. Passengers with disabilities should be able to 
benefit from competition and low fares like other Americans.
    Finally, we support reauthorization of the ACAA Advisory Committee, 
which was first authorized in the 2018 FAA Reauthorization. The 
Committee, which included airline and airport representatives; 
wheelchair manufacturers; and veterans, disability, and service animal 
organizations reviewed DOT's draft of the Passengers with Disabilities 
Bill of Rights and considered recommendations related to ticketing 
practices and seating accommodations, stowage of assistive devices, and 
assistance at airports and on aircraft and related training. Although 
the Committee's final report consisted primarily of recommendations 
concerning the need for further study of the issues or adoption of best 
practices, we believe the Committee should continue and hope it will be 
a greater force for change in the future.
    Addressing air travel problems is not only the right thing to do, 
it is also a smart business decision. Over 75 percent of respondents 
from the earlier referenced survey said that if the air travel 
experience of passengers with disabilities improved they would fly at 
least a few times a year. Fifteen percent said they would fly monthly.
    PVA appreciates the opportunity to express our views. I would be 
happy to answer any questions.

                 STATEMENT OF JEFFREY N. SHANE,

               FORMER UNDER SECRETARY FOR POLICY,

               U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

    Mr. Shane. [Technical problems]--Chair Cantwell, Ranking 
Member Cruz, and other members of the Committee, I really thank 
you for the invitation to be here this morning. I have a longer 
statement that I hope can be inserted in the record, but I will 
try to sum it up quickly now.
    Let me say at the outset that I am here representing nobody 
but myself. My primary credential, if any, is a long career in 
Government, 25 years spread over 40, most of which was at the 
Department of Transportation, and most of which was also in one 
way or another, all about economic regulation.
    For more than 10 years, I had broad responsibility, among 
other things, for DOT's oversight of commercial aviation. Most 
importantly, its relations with consumers. So, it is a special 
privilege to be able to share with you my personal perspective 
as a former regulator on one of the most difficult and fraught 
periods in the history of commercial flight.
    The image of commercial aviation has been broadly damaged 
over the past few months by what most of us think is a 
seriously disappointing performance. Not all carriers have 
performed badly, but we all know that one bad apple spoils the 
barrel, and in this case, it was more than one.
    The poster child for the industry's recent inadequacy, of 
course, is the weeklong meltdown of Southwest during one of the 
busiest travel periods of the year. Some 2 million Southwest 
customers had their holiday plans dashed by the meltdown or 
were at least seriously inconvenienced. It was a monstrous 
failure.
    Without any attempt to minimize the devastating 
consequences of that week for so many, however, it is useful to 
pause for a moment and think about that 2 million passenger 
number. The failure of one airline to perform during 1 week 
affected 2 million passengers. It reminds us how important air 
travel is to our lives today.
    Prior to the pandemic, there were nearly a billion 
enplanements within the United States every year. Those numbers 
are directly attributable to what Ranking Member Cruz referred 
to earlier, to one of the most profoundly important pieces of 
legislation Congress has ever enacted, the Airline Deregulation 
Act of 1978.
    It democratized aviation. Now, I know this is probably not 
the right time to get misty eyed about the benefits of airline 
deregulation. Still, as we think about the industry today and 
what might be done to prevent future meltdowns, or to diminish 
the number of passenger complaints about various airline 
policies and practices, it is important to recall that Congress 
predicated the Airline Deregulation Act on a single overarching 
idea, that however important they may be to the national 
economy, airlines are businesses not public utilities.
    Congress intended that henceforth Government would treat 
them as businesses and give them the widest scope for 
innovation and competition. And that is why the legislation 
explicitly prohibited any further regulation of airline rates, 
routes, or services, the areas where they wanted that 
innovation and competition to take place.
    Economists consistently tell us, as we have just heard, 
that consumers have benefited enormously. Now, of course, the 
wisdom of that legislation has been called into question. I am 
not entirely sure, but I think this may be the first time in 
the 45 years since the law was signed that we are seeing 
serious proposals to roll back at least some of its elements.
    To the proponents of rollback, I would respectfully urge 
caution. If my experience during all the years I toiled in this 
field taught me anything, it can be summed up with a few simple 
points.
    First, in responding to any episode that damaged the 
interests of consumers, it is important to ask whether a 
proposed rule or law is likely to make any actual difference in 
the future conduct of airlines, or whether the costs of the 
incident itself, both monetary and reputational, would likely 
achieve exactly the same result without Government 
intervention.
    I have read that the Southwest meltdown will subtract 
something north of $800 million from the carrier's bottom line. 
That near $1 billion hit sounds to me like a pretty powerful 
incentive to prevent any repeats, and I am sure it is job one 
right now at Southwest C-suite. You can be sure that other 
airlines are carefully studying the incident.
    Second, to use a shopworn metaphor, sunlight is the best 
disinfectant. Customers obviously should be fully aware of 
every detail of any transaction with an airline, and thanks to 
the rules crafted by DOT over many years, that information is 
easily available to them now. If it is not, enforcement action 
is called for.
    Transparency is essential, and it also engenders more 
robust competition among airlines. Finally, in a dynamic, 
rapidly evolving industry like air transportation, prescribing 
a one-size-fits-all solution to any perceived problem in 
airline conduct has the unfortunate consequence of homogenizing 
the business, making it look more like a commodity and thereby 
sapping much of its competitive energy and its scope for 
innovation. I will stop there and I look forward to your 
questions.

    Madam Chair, Ranking Member Cruz, and other member of the 
Subcommittee:
    I appreciate very much having the honor and privilege of speaking 
to you this morning at this important hearing. Thank you for the 
invitation.
Introduction
    Let me say at the outset that I am here representing nobody but 
myself. My primary credential, if any, is a long career in public 
service--25 years spread over 40--most of which was at the Department 
of Transportation, and most of which was also, in one way or another, 
all about economic regulation. It was even the subject I enjoyed most 
in law school, although I attended law school before the word 
``deregulation'' had even been coined.
    I began my career in Washington as a government trial attorney, 
representing the public interest in hearings at some long-gone 
regulatory agencies--the Federal Power Commission, the Interstate 
Commerce Commission, and the Civil Aeronautics Board. I even did a case 
at the Federal Maritime Commission, which still exists, but I have no 
memory of what that case was about.
    In any event, I claim to know something about economic regulation--
what works and what doesn't. It was that experience that turned me into 
an unapologetic believer in the benefits of a free and competitive 
marketplace.
    Much later, I had the good fortune to be appointed, with the 
approval of this Committee and the full Senate, to some senior policy 
positions at DOT. These were not aviation-specific positions--they were 
about all modes of transportation. I soon discovered, however, as I 
suspect members of this Committee have discovered, that aviation policy 
is never far from the top of the list. Because it is an industry that 
everyone knows so well, airlines are always in the spotlight.
    Thus, for more than 10 years, either as DOT's Assistant Secretary 
for Policy or later as Under Secretary for Policy, I had broad 
responsibility, subject of course to the leadership of the Secretary of 
Transportation, for DOT's economic regulation of the airline industry. 
It was far and away my most enjoyable professional experience, both 
because the issues were so important to so many, and because of the 
extraordinary colleagues I was lucky enough to work with throughout 
that time. Some are still there. I miss them all.
Importance of the Airline Deregulation Act
    The reason why so many of our citizens know aviation so well, of 
course, is that Congress democratized it in 1978. I'm talking, of 
course, about the Airline Deregulation Act. That legislation, initially 
championed by Senator Ted Kennedy, was nothing less than a miracle of 
public policy. Increasingly forgotten is that the airlines were 
adamantly opposed to the legislation. They had become very comfortable 
in the familiar cocoon provided by the CAB and they pulled out all the 
stops to keep the bill from being passed. The public, for most of whom 
air travel was still a rare and expensive experience, wasn't 
particularly interested. There was no groundswell of public support for 
the bill because nobody really understood what its impact would be. 
Well organized opposition and weak, diffuse support is usually a 
prescription for failure in the legislative process. Yet somehow, 
remarkably, the law was passed, President Carter signed it, and 
aviation would never again be the same.
    Airline deregulation not only benefited Americans; it was actually 
one of America's most profoundly important gifts to the world, although 
not always welcomed in the first instance. In the 1980s I spent four 
years at the Department of State serving as the chief U.S. aviation 
negotiator, working with other governments on the bilateral agreements 
that define international landing rights for U.S. and foreign airlines. 
Most of the foreign carriers back then were creatures of government--
either government-owned or acting as though they were. We encountered 
resistance everywhere, an entrenched protectionism that had impeded the 
growth of international air travel for decades. Through an initiative 
launched during the Carter Administration in parallel with domestic 
deregulation, we slowly sold our trading partners, one by one, on the 
benefits of an open market. U.S. airlines were as opposed to that 
initiative as they were to domestic deregulation, but administration 
after administration kept it going. It became easier over time because 
we could demonstrate quantitatively how much faster liberalized 
international markets grew than regulated markets.
    In 1992, the United States announced an Open Skies policy and 
signed the first Open Skies agreement with The Netherlands. America 
today has about 125 Open Skies agreements--in other words, with most of 
our trading partners--and the model has been replicated even in air 
travel markets that don't touch the U.S. It is a bipartisan success 
story of the first magnitude.
    Central to the genius of the Airline Deregulation Act are a couple 
of overarching principles. One, of course, is that airlines are 
businesses. Congress intended that henceforth government would treat 
them as businesses and give them the widest scope for innovation and 
competition. That is why the legislation prohibited any regulation of 
airline rates, routes, or services--the areas where they wanted that 
innovation and competition to take place..
    Second, because airlines for the most part are so conspicuously in 
interstate commerce, any future oversight and regulation--most 
obviously safety regulation--was reserved to the Federal government 
alone. A single, nationally consistent set of rules, Congress knew, was 
essential to safe, efficient, and economical operations.
    Notwithstanding their emancipation from traditional regulation, 
airlines are still subject to a lot of government oversight. Obviously 
we never deregulated the safety of airlines, which is why commercial 
flight continues to be the safest form of travel. DOT also has 
authority under 49 U.S.C. Sec. 41712 to prevent unfair and deceptive 
practices and unfair methods of competition. A lot of regulations have 
been promulgated under that rubric in the interest of consumers, most 
importantly ensuring the transparency of airline offerings and thus 
ensuring that airline customers know what they are buying. DOT has a 
mandate in the Air Carrier Access Act to prevent discrimination against 
passengers with disabilities. And I would also argue that the 
Department's authority to review the managerial and financial 
wherewithal of airlines--conducted in parallel with the FAA's review of 
airline operational fitness--is another way the Department protects the 
interests of consumers.
Has deregulation gone too far?
    Recent developments in the industry have triggered a conversation, 
however, about whether deregulation has gone too far, and whether it is 
time for government to get back into the game of disciplining the way 
airlines do business.
    I don't want to overstate this: I don't believe anyone is talking 
about repealing the Airline Deregulation Act and resurrecting the Civil 
Aeronautics Board. Nevertheless, I have seen a number of proposals that 
certainly appear to channel the spirit of the CAB, and that would 
require DOT to reconstruct at least some of the CAB's long-forgotten 
regulatory jurisprudence.
    If my experience over all the years I toiled in this field taught 
me anything, it is this: the government must exercise extreme caution 
in promulgating rules designed to alter the conduct of private 
business. Allow me to illustrate what I mean by reference to some of 
the current targets of concern.
Ancillary fees
    What we call ``ancillary fees'' in aviation are an example of what 
economists call ``unbundling.'' Unbundling was actually invented by 
regulators based on the simple and unarguable principle that people 
shouldn't be required to pay for what they don't want--like a black 
rotary-dial telephone when all you wanted was a phone line.
    In an effort to provide basic air transportation at the most 
affordable prices, low-cost and ultra-low-cost carriers have delinked 
the baggage part of the transaction from the travel part. I hope nobody 
is thinking about requiring ULCs and ULCCs to desist from unbundling--
charging all passengers the same thing whether they check a bag or not. 
If they did, the bizarre result would be to require passengers 
traveling with nothing more than a carry-on to subsidize the passengers 
who check bags free of charge. That would be the very anthesis of 
transparency in pricing, and arguably even an ``unfair and deceptive 
practice.''
    Passengers complain that the baggage fees are unreasonable. Even if 
airlines are not required to abandon ancillary baggage fees, therefore, 
some suggest that DOT should play price regulator and try to figure out 
what a reasonable baggage fee is.
    First, lest there be any doubt, that would be an explicit 
renunciation of the Airline Deregulation Act's central prohibition 
against the regulation of airline rates and services. Congress can 
certainly do that if it wants to, but why would it want to? If it's 
okay to prescribe what an airline charges for putting a suitcase in the 
belly of an airplane, why not prescribe what it costs to buy a pastry 
and coffee in the terminal? What distinguishes the purchase of space in 
the baggage hold from any other transaction in our private sector 
economy? It just isn't normally the government's job to prescribe 
prices charged by private companies to their customers, and the fact 
that the target is an airline doesn't create an exception to that 
principle.
    And, by the way, how would DOT actually go about deciding what a 
reasonable bag fee is? Would it have to hire a cadre of administrative 
law judges and conduct formal proceedings pursuant to the 
Administrative Procedure Act? Would DOT require the disclosure of 
confidential cost information in order to ascertain the ``real'' cost 
of checking a bag? Would there be a right of appeal if the airline 
disagrees with the Department's definition of ``reasonableness'' or 
with the fees DOT orders the airline to charge? If so, to the 
Secretary? I would submit that DOT has more important things to do.
Concentration
    The late Michael Levine was a supremely talented lawyer and 
economist, and is widely credited with being one of the intellectual 
fathers of airline deregulation. He was also a very good friend. 
Speaking about the early days of deregulation, he once said that the 
founders thought that, once the regulatory wraps were removed, a whole 
galaxy of new airlines would appear and light up the firmament. ``What 
we actually got,'' Mike said, ``was a meteor shower.'' He was referring 
to the large number of startup airlines that came rushing into the 
newly opened marketplace just because they were allowed to. Most 
quickly flamed out, some because they didn't know what they were doing, 
and others simply because the market couldn't deliver enough business 
to support that many airlines profitably. That chapter carries an 
important lesson, I think, for anyone who thinks good antitrust policy 
should be something akin to ``the more the merrier.''
    The 1980s saw a spate of airline mergers, all approved by DOT 
because the statutory authority to review domestic airline mergers 
wouldn't migrate to the Department of Justice until 1989. By the time 
the first Bush administration took office in that year, there were 
widespread concerns about whether the market for air travel had simply 
become too concentrated. Samuel Skinner, the newly appointed Secretary 
of Transportation, took the complaints seriously and let it be known 
that if the concerns were borne out by empirical evidence, he would 
seek authority to take appropriate action in the interest of consumers.
    I was the Assistant Secretary for Policy at this time, and a 
detailed study was conducted by my office--led by my superb deputy, 
Patrick Murphy. When it was finished, it filled nine peer reviewed 
volumes.
    What we found, in a nutshell, was that, while there were indeed 
fewer airlines serving the domestic U.S. market, the actual choices 
available to travelers in actual city pair markets had actually 
increased, and price competition in the market continued to be robust. 
In the end, we saw no need for any tinkering with the Airline 
Deregulation Act. I testified at a number of congressional hearings on 
airline competition during that administration, and thanks to the 
unbiased and objective quality of that study, I emerged mostly 
unscathed.
    There have been more mergers since then. One important result is a 
financially healthier airline industry--putting aside for the moment 
the devastating impact of the pandemic. It is fair to ask whether that 
improved financial health has come at the expense of consumer welfare. 
I am not a professional economist and I'm in no position to offer a 
first-hand answer to that important question. According to all that 
I've read, however, airfares continue to fall and consumer choice 
continues to increase. There are few barriers to new entry, as the 
launch of Breeze Air and Avelo at the height of the COVID pandemic 
should make clear. The deregulated aviation market appears to be 
working well.
    Caution, therefore, should be the order of the day. What do the 
numbers actually tell us? You don't make competition policy based 
simply on the number of airlines in the market, or on the aggregate 
market share enjoyed by the ``big three'' or ``big four''; instead, you 
carefully examine the quality of the choices available to actual 
passengers in actual city pairs and you look objectively at actual 
pricing trends.
Transparency
    One of DOT's greatest successes in its continuing work on behalf of 
consumers is its transparency requirements for airlines and their 
agents. Customers should know everything about the transaction they are 
about to enter into--the identity of the airline on every segment of a 
journey, the actual prices to be paid, which services are covered by 
those prices and which are not, and so forth. DOT's required reporting 
of airlines' on-time performance, market by market, has been another 
great boon to travelers.
    I have seen proposals for going even further, however, and I find 
them concerning. Like the firms in every sector of our economy, 
airlines seek to compete not only on price and ubiquity, but also 
through product differentiation. They know there is a tendency to treat 
air travel as a commodity, but they really don't think it is, and they 
don't want their customers to think so either. If you spend a few 
hundred million dollars upgrading the interior of your airplanes, or 
your lounges, or cabin connectivity, or the check-in process, or even 
your food and beverage service, you want potential customers to know 
about those improvements. You want those improvements to attract more 
customers.
    Not long ago, if you booked a flight using one of the major online 
distribution systems you found only the most basic information there: a 
list of available flights, their departure times, and their costs and 
fees. Those displays merely reinforced the impression that you were 
purchasing a fungible commodity. A few years ago there was a major 
dispute between the airlines and the major global distribution systems 
over the alleged failure of the GDSs to upgrade their technology in 
order to provide the richer content the airlines wanted. Make no 
mistake: this was an argument about whether the GDSs perceived 
deficiencies were actually preventing the airlines from competing in 
the way they wanted to, merely reinforcing the commodity narrative, and 
squandering much of the value of airline investments in product 
quality.
    The GDSs are clearly upping their game in response to their 
customers' requirements, and those customers include the airlines 
themselves. But quality varies. Given the importance to airlines today 
of rich, user-friendly content, suggestions that airlines should be 
required to sell their services through any available platform should 
be viewed with the greatest skepticism. Airlines do not need any 
external motivation to distribute information about their services in 
the most effective way, but the assessment of what's most effective 
should be theirs alone.
Delays and cancellations
    The European Union promulgated a regulation years ago called 
Regulation 261. I have said in many fora that Regulation 261 is 
quintessentially a bad regulation. It prescribes payments airlines must 
make to their customers automatically whenever there's a delay. The 
payments are graduated according to the length of the delay. It is a 
quintessentially bad regulation because it has absolutely no effect on 
the conduct of airlines. The simple test of a good regulation is 
whether it can be expected to improve consumer welfare by making 
something happen that wouldn't happen if you didn't have the 
regulation. Regulation 261 clearly fails that test since airlines 
already have the greatest possible incentive to operate on time. The 
costs of delay--particularly for a networked carrier where an entire 
day's schedule can be destroyed by a single late flight--are already 
immense. Requiring payments to passengers is nothing more than piling 
on. Yes, they provide a nice consolation prize to the inconvenienced 
passenger, but that's not the avowed purpose of the regulation. The 
purpose is to reduce the frequency of delays, and it can't add more 
incentive than airlines already have.
    We are now seeing proposals to adopt Regulation 261 lookalikes in 
the U.S. What would they do? Consider the week-long Southwest meltdown 
over the holidays. Reportedly, that catastrophe, which seriously 
inconvenienced a couple of million passengers, will cost Southwest 
something north of $800 million dollars. If you're looking for a way to 
encourage Southwest to plan more effectively in order to avoid similar 
catastrophes in the future, subtracting $800 million from the bottom 
line would seem to qualify. Does it contribute anything to the public 
interest to add some automatic payment that Southwest would pay to each 
affected traveler, thereby tripling the financial cost? First, its only 
contribution would be a small windfall to passengers--not the change in 
behavior that the payment scheme was intended to encourage. Second, 
Southwest would have to find a way to recoup that additional cost, and 
the only way to do it will be through higher fares.
    It's axiomatic that predicating a regulatory remedy on what was 
clearly a worst-case scenario is never a good idea. It's an even worse 
idea to impose costs on airlines when those additional costs can't be 
expected to engender any change in behavior that hasn't already been 
encouraged by the grave financial consequences of that behavior. Once 
again, there needs to be careful consideration of the actual costs vs. 
the actual benefits of such a rule.
    Finally, I know some have considered whether it's unfair for 
airlines to put an expiration date--typically one year--on a voucher 
provided to a passenger who has cancelled a nonrefundable ticket. Some 
airlines--Southwest for example--do not impose expiration dates. Should 
the government prohibit all carriers from establishing expiration 
dates? It would seem passing strange for the government, avowedly 
interested in increasing competition in the market, to promulgate a 
rule that takes away Southwest's competitive advantage
Conclusion
    Thanks to--I'll say it again--the miracle of deregulation, America 
today enjoys a highly competitive, rapidly evolving, technologically 
sophisticated airline industry. A defining feature of the business 
today is its continuing quest for innovation, for new ways of 
attracting customers, for distinguishing competitors from each other, 
and even for crafting new business models. After decades of struggle, 
the industry has found a way to maintain its financial health, thereby 
ensuring continued investment in consumer-facing improvements.
    Please don't misunderstand. There is clearly scope for beneficial 
regulation in circumstances where market forces can't be expected to 
resolve an issue. The Air Carrier Access Act has made things better for 
disabled passengers, for example, but we can and should do more. My 
point is only that it would be a serious error of policy to adopt 
legislation and/or regulations that freeze the industry in its tracks, 
homogenize its means of distribution, prescribe what it can charge for 
some services and what it can't, and needlessly sap much of the 
competitive energy that should govern airline customer relations. If we 
are singling out airlines for a level of regulatory micromanagement 
that we wouldn't conceive of visiting on other businesses, we need to 
be clear about the public policy rationale for that different 
treatment.
    Thank you again for the invitation to present these thoughts. I 
look forward to your comments and questions.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. I now recognize myself for 
the first round of questions. I know today's hearing is on 
consumer issues, so I want to start by talking about consumer 
safety. Senator Baldwin and I introduced the Emergency Vacating 
of the Aircraft Cabin Act, the EVAC Act, to require the FAA to 
establish evacuation standards that take real life conditions 
like the presence of carry-on bags, children, seniors, and 
passengers with disabilities into account.
    Ms. Nelson, if I could just have a quick yes or no to the 
following three questions. I will give you time to elaborate 
afterwards. First, have you ever been on a flight where there 
were no carry-on bags?
    Ms. Nelson. No.
    Senator Duckworth. Have you ever been on a flight, or what 
percentage of flights that you worked did not have children 
under the age of 18, seniors over the age of 60, or persons 
with disabilities?
    Ms. Nelson. 0 percent.
    Senator Duckworth. Do you think FAA simulation testing is 
effective?
    Ms. Nelson. No.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. Now, can you briefly explain 
why it is so important for the FAA to conduct simulation tests 
with real life conditions? And I just want to start by saying 
that the FAA's current way of doing it is to take a fuselage, 
put 60 people on it, nobody over the age of 60, nobody under 
the age of 18, no carry-on bags, and no disabilities, and they 
say they can evacuate. That that simulates a real condition. 
So, can you speak to why it is important to actually simulate 
real life conditions?
    Ms. Nelson. Yes. Thank you so much for the question. So, 
the evacuation standards are not--first of all, do not take 
into account the current conditions in the cabin, the full 
aircraft, the seats that are closer together, the iPads and 
tablets that are out everywhere with cords.
    The growing accessibility, frankly, to everyone who is on 
the plane. And if we don't take into consideration the actual 
conditions in the cabin today, we are going to have a test in 
real life aviation where people will lose their lives. We do 
not want to test this for the first time in an actual event.
    So, we need to take into consideration there are different 
issues that can be brought into the simulation of whether or 
not an aircraft can be evacuated in that amount of time. There 
has been concern in the past about utilizing children and 
elderly people and people with disabilities in the evacuation 
test themselves, but those can be entered into the simulation 
process and at least considered.
    We should also be considering fumes in the cabin and any 
other obstructed objects, and the issue of carry-on bags. None 
of that is considered in the evacuation certification process 
right now, and that is why your bill is so critically important 
to determine what the actual conditions are today in the cabin 
and how we can safely evacuate people in an emergency.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. We certainly test the safety 
of automobiles with crash test dummies to simulate babies in 
car seats and people with disabilities, so I am certain that 
you can introduce human analogous dummies into the process. 
Thank you.
    Ms. Nelson. Agreed.
    Senator Duckworth. Last year my friend former Congressman 
Jim Langbehn was attempting to lead a House Armed Services 
Committee Congressional Delegation when Lufthansa refused to 
allow him to board because its employees at the gate were 
confused about wheelchair, about whether his wheelchair battery 
was allowed on the flight. It did not matter that the United 
States Navy had already confirmed with the airline before the 
trip that his wheelchair specifications were permissible.
    And confusion isn't just limited to batteries. It can also 
be about something as simple as what size wheelchairs can fit 
on which kind of plane due to varying cargo capacity. This is 
incredibly frustrating and frankly unnecessary.
    It was my friend and hero, the late Judy Heumann, who 
brought this issue to my attention. I am writing a provision 
for FAA reauthorization inspired by Judy that would require 
carriers to provide passengers with disabilities basic 
transparency and information.
    Ms. Ansley, if airlines were required to post basic 
information on their websites and apps like the size of their 
cargo holds, where both passengers and gate agents could easily 
reference it, would that help minimize confusion and make 
travel more predictable for passengers with mobility aides?
    Ms. Ansley. Thank you for the question, Chair Duckworth. It 
certainly would help to provide customers with more information 
about the experience that they are going to have during flight.
    Judy Heumann was a great friend to all of us, and I have 
had the privilege of advocating with her because she had so 
many issues traveling the world by using her wheelchair.
    And having the opportunity to know not only how--what 
aircraft her device would fit on, fit on safely, but also, 
quite frankly, working toward the goal of being able to just 
simply fly from your wheelchair would be a great opportunity to 
solve those issues.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. Is the disability community 
satisfied with the current level of accessibility at our 
Nation's airports? Do you think more needs to be done in terms 
of elevators, ramps, accessible restrooms, that kind of thing?
    Ms. Ansley. Yes. More does need to be done in the airport 
context to improve accessibility. We hear a lot about charging 
stations at gates not being accessible to people who use 
wheelchairs.
    Announcements that folks can't hear, counters that are not 
correct heights, the accessible restrooms that everybody seems 
to like to go on with their luggage, that require people with 
wheelchairs to wait until they are available.
    There is still more that can be done, and we hope that 
airports will be even more proactive in increasing access.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. I now recognize the Ranking 
Member Cruz for his questions.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you to each of 
the witnesses. Mr. Shane, let me start with you. Thank you for 
being here today. Some witnesses and some Congressional 
Democrats have said that the era of airline deregulation is 
over, that it failed, and that the Federal Government should 
reregulate it.
    I have heard suggestions for the Government to micro-manage 
flight schedules, how much someone should pay to transport an 
extra bag, and everything else in between. These ideas come, of 
course, in spite of the market decrease in the price of airfare 
and a dramatic increase in the number of Americans who have 
been able to fly since the Airline Deregulation Act was enacted 
in 1978.
    In your judgment, what should we be doing to further the 
miracle of deregulation, which is the term you used in your 
testimony?
    Mr. Shane. As I said, I think that transparency is the most 
important regulatory response to an awful lot of the problems 
that we have been talking about. If passengers are unaware of 
what is available to them, of course, then they are going to be 
disadvantaged and competition will not work nearly as 
effectively as it should.
    Any of the issues that people are complaining today about 
are the subject to some extent of airline competition. So, I 
understand Southwest, for example, does have indefinite credits 
when a refund is given.
    Other airlines put an expiration date on. Well, the 
airlines that put expiration dates on will notice that they are 
losing traffic to Southwest because of that important 
difference, and they will respond. That is how competition 
works.
    So, I think the Department of Transportation's emphasis on 
making as much transparency as possible available to passengers 
has been a very important--a very important benefit. Airlines 
have become, if I can just finish with one thought, incredible 
competitors, notwithstanding what we have heard this morning.
    They, like all competitors, want to compete with each other 
on the basis of product differentiation. It is very difficult 
in the airline business to actually tell passengers what makes 
you different from your competitor.
    That is why some of the suggestions that airlines be 
required, for example, to market through all platforms are so 
antithetical to the very concept of deregulation. You are 
forcing airlines to transact with companies they may or may not 
choose to transact with because they can't show their consumers 
the rich content that they would like to.
    If you are investing hundreds of millions of dollars in 
your interiors, in your connectivity, in the speed with which 
people can check in, all of these amenities, passengers need to 
know about that. That is what makes competition work and that 
is what encourages airlines to keep upping their game.
    So, the idea, as I said, of creating a one size fits all 
solution to any of these problems is really antithetical to the 
benefits that consumers have enjoyed thus far through 
deregulation. I would seriously caution against doing that. We 
just don't want to go back there.
    Senator Cruz. Yes, Mr. Shane, I will say in elected 
politics, it can sometimes be good politics to pick things that 
are unpopular and declare yourself the enemy of them.
    And so, you know, I still recall sitting on the floor of 
the House not too long ago and listening to the President's 
State of the Union address, where he talked more about airline 
baggage fees than he did about how we are going to defeat 
communist China. And I get people are annoyed at fees.
    I am annoyed at fees. People are annoyed at small seats. I 
don't like how seats have gotten smaller. And it is pretty good 
politics to say we are going to give--ensure that every 
passenger has a bigger seat. We are going to ensure that every 
passenger doesn't have to pay any fees.
    We are going to ensure that every passenger gets a free 
neck rub and foot rub with every flight. Is there any downside 
to politicians giving away free stuff? It can be good politics 
to say, let's mandate, here is all the things the airlines must 
do for every passenger. But is there a downside when Government 
steps in and says, here is what you must do on every flight?
    Mr. Shane. Yes, Senator Cruz, I think there is a downside. 
Unfortunately, the downside isn't immediately apparent. The 
downside comes later as the industry becomes less competitive, 
as prices begin to go up, as airlines necessarily recoup the 
cost of providing the services that have been mandated by 
Government in the way they have been mandated. The real 
objection to a lot of the responses I have seen to concerns 
about the way airlines perform is that--you can't be an airline 
manager if you are in Government. I mean, you just don't know 
enough.
    Senator Cruz. And just because time is expiring, Ms. 
Ansley, I want to ask you a question as well. Thank you for 
your testimony and a very important testimony. What actions 
should Congress take to make clear to the Department of 
Transportation that they should take the law and Congressional 
intent seriously to protect passengers with disabilities, and 
to get them to enforce the laws that are on the books?
    Ms. Ansley. Thank you for that question. We support efforts 
that would require the Department of Transportation to use the 
civil penalties it has in its disclosure. It doesn't--it does 
not use those opportunities sufficiently, in our opinion.
    And we think that in the Air Carrier Access Amendment Act, 
there are a list of areas where we feel like we shouldn't be 
talking about whether or not we should have a civil penalty if 
there is a violation, if you harm someone, if you, you know, 
destroyed their wheelchair.
    I would hope that we would all agree those are a time when 
we should have a penalty that is put into place. And quite 
frankly, that those cases would be referred over to the 
Department of Justice, just like we have in all other forms of 
transportation because of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you.
    Senator Duckworth. I recognize Senator Tester.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Senator Tester. Thank you, Madam Chair. And I want to thank 
Senator Klobuchar for allowing me to ask questions. I 
appreciate all the folks who testify today. I was watching you 
online before I got here, and I appreciate all your testimony.
    I was not going to talk about deregulation, but what the 
hell, we might as well touch on it a little bit. I think one of 
the problems here is we talk about deregulation from a 
standpoint of where people live and lots of people live. And it 
works pretty damn well if you have got a big population base.
    But if you don't have a big population base, I will give 
you an example. And I agree with most of what you said, Mr. 
Shane, but here is one of the problems. Southwest Airlines 
takes credits forever. One of the other airlines that served me 
does not. I got to drive 5 hours to get to a Southwest flight. 
I got to drive 5 hours, OK. That is not really something that 
works, OK.
    So, what I am saying is this is I believe in free market 
and capitalism. I am going to tell you when it costs me three 
times as much to fly from Montana to
    Washington, D.C., as it does from Dulles to Europe, there 
is something nuts about that unless those engines don't work as 
well on Montana Air. You know, maybe they use more fuel. I 
don't know. I have never figured that out.
    But I would just tell you that it works really well if you 
live in a hub and you are in a population center. But if you 
are not, you are paying through the nose. You are paying 
through the nose and you have less service today than you had 
before 1978. And I say that from a Great Falls, Montana, 
perspective.
    And that is not to say that deregulation was bad. It just 
doesn't work as well as everybody think it does in rural areas. 
And that is where I get to you, Mr. Moyers. I want to ask you a 
little bit about, when airlines pull service, do they tell you 
why?
    Mr. Moyers. Thank you for the question. I have had 
negotiations with airlines that have wanted to start service 
and then they have actually failed and not come into the 
market. And it is always been that business decision for them. 
The metrics don't work. The cost per seat mile.
    They give an explanation like that. Recently where we have 
lost service now--we have not had them pull out of the market. 
They have just downsized. So, the frequency where we used to 
have four daily flights to Seattle, we are in the same 
situation as you where it is a 3-hour drive otherwise.
    That reduction in frequency, the conversations we have is 
it is a resource allocation. Not enough aircraft, not enough 
pilots to fly the aircraft. And so that is a finite commodity. 
They are not going to fly those higher risk markets, perhaps.
    Senator Tester. So, when I fly out to come back here, which 
I do every week, four legs a week, the planes are full. They 
are full. But out of the blue, every once in a while, it 
happened a couple of years ago, they just pull a flight.
    They just pull it, no longer exists. So then instead of 
flying through Minneapolis--they restored the flight finally, 
but instead of flying through Minneapolis to D.C., which, by 
the way, takes 2 hours off the flight--I have to flight South 
before heading East.
    Do they offer any options, when they pull a flight that, by 
the way, is pretty darn well used, do they ever offer you any 
options to get it back?
    Mr. Moyers. The conversations we have with our incumbent 
that is offering service right now to restore service, to 
regain frequency, it is going to take a negotiation that is 
likely to be some sort of incentive to cover the cost for the 
risk for them to return to the market.
    Senator Tester. OK. In your testimony, you argued for 
larger EAS subsidies and other economic incentives to help keep 
air service at smaller airports. It is critically important, as 
you well know, from an economic development standpoint.
    We talked about the number of passengers in the Southwest 
situation. If you don't have good airfare, you have both arms 
tied behind your back, if you don't have good air service. Have 
you talked with other airlines about these subsidies and how 
much it would take?
    Mr. Moyers. It is a great question. When we meet with 
airlines, we discuss that cost to be in the market. What fees 
can we waive to attract them in?
    From being in the terminal, those cost to lease space, to 
do the ground handling, all of those things are--we try to 
negotiate to get that incentive to the airline that will 
startup the service. Right now, we have a scarcity grant in 
place for revenue guarantees to the Bay Area.
    I mentioned earlier in my testimony Microsoft, a high-tech 
company that has a headquarter in San Francisco, one of the 
reasons they came to the area was we had connectivity and we 
were trying to get additional service to the Bay Area. That was 
important to them.
    We are sitting on right now in about a $1.1 million fund 
and have been since 2018 because we can't attract an airline to 
provide that service.
    Senator Tester. OK. One last question, if I might, Madam 
Chair, for Ms. Ansley. When a veteran's mobility aide gets 
damaged, number one, how long does it take to get repaired, and 
what does that veteran do in the meantime?
    Ms. Ansley. So, the question--thank you for the question. 
The answer is it depends. The--I have one veteran who attended 
our women veterans retreat last fall. The power assist wheels 
on her wheelchair were destroyed, so she--they gave her just 
plain wheels so she has got to push them.
    For 2 months it was with the airlines contractor that was 
supposed to be getting it fixed before they called her and 
said, ``we don't even have a contract with the company that 
sells these so there is nothing we can do.''
    At that point, we got the airline involved because we 
raised it up and they said we will even pay the VA if they will 
do it because it was so delayed. I have another veteran who was 
out here for our fly in just a few weeks ago when our President 
testified before the Veteran's committee.
    His controller was broken on his wheelchair. He said that 
it has been a couple of weeks now. They have evaluated it, but 
he doesn't have the part. So, every time he takes his hand off 
the joystick, it swings out of place.
    So, he has to constantly move it back into place. He 
doesn't know when he is going to get the parts. So, wheelchair 
damage can take a long time to fix depending on where you got 
to get the parts from. Sometimes the VA steps in if they can, 
even though it is not technically their responsibility.
    Senator Tester. And itis fair to say these are mobility 
aides. Without these aides, they can't be mobile, so they can't 
get around. They can't do much.
    Ms. Ansley. That is 100 percent correct, sir.
    Senator Tester. Thank you.
    Senator Duckworth. They are my legs. My wheelchair are my 
legs. Imagine if a regular passenger had their legs broken on a 
flight and had to wait weeks or months.
    And in fact, my power assist chair was just broken on 
Saturday, and I am sitting in a 12-year-old chair right now. 
Chair recognizes Senator Schmitt for his questions.

                STATEMENT OF HON. ERIC SCHMITT, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI

    Senator Schmitt. Thank you all for being here today. It has 
been mentioned, I know, by a number of other Senators, but we 
all fly a lot, so these issues are so near and dear, not just 
to us, but obviously the millions that fly and our 
constituents. And that is even more magnified, a lot of these 
concerns, in a lot of the rural airports.
    In places like, you know, Cape Girardeau and Fort Leonard 
Wood in Joplin, Kirksville in Missouri, and all across the 
country. We have seen a number of instances of near collisions 
and cancellations that I think draw a lot of concern. And I 
still find it remarkable, remarkable that Pete Buttigieg has 
refused to show up to this committee ever, for anything, given 
everything that is going on.
    So, and I have already highlighted this Administration's 
like obsession with woke policies and mitigating climate change 
and increasing equity, which has nothing to do with the FAA's 
mission. The FAA's mission is safety and affordability and 
efficient travel for the people that we represent.
    And again, it is just sort of a downward spiral of this 
Administration. And, you know, yesterday we talked about just 
not even caring about places like East Palestine. So that is 
not the focus of my questions for you. I just think it is--we 
are here to talk about safety, and one thing that I--and the 
impact that that some of these proposed regulations could have 
on rural airports in our communities.
    I did want to ask you, Mr. Shane, a question. Workforce 
issues--I mean, no matter what industry we are talking about 
there, workforce issues. You know, it seems to me that these 
challenges can be particularly acute when you are talking about 
an industry like the airline industry, where you need good, 
qualified people.
    When we talk about safety, you need people who know what 
they are doing and can provide that expertise. And getting more 
young people interested is one thing as a, you know, a good 
paying career. See if they choose.
    What is it that you see that could be done differently than 
the way that we are doing? It seems that a lot of these tracks 
to get people into these particular trades or into this kind or 
into this kind of work can be long. It can be--and that is 
important, I think, to gain the expertise.
    But what is it that can be done that we are not talking 
about right now as, you know, our system--our education and 
workforce training system continues to evolve. What can we do 
differently to prepare, you know, the next group of mechanics 
and people who can work on these, you know, sophisticated 
aircraft to keep people safe?
    Mr. Shane. Thank you for the question, Senator. You are 
seeing a lot of spontaneous developments within the airline 
industry itself. Academies are being set up to train mechanics, 
to train flight attendants and pilots in greater numbers in 
order to--in order to respond to the shortfalls that have 
resulted as a result of the decimation of traffic during the 
pandemic.
    The airline industry was hit as never before, and this 
caused a huge disruption in the flow of workers. So, there is 
that element within the industry itself. I think there are 
Government programs that encourage young people to come into 
the industry, internships and that sort of thing.
    I am not entirely familiar with all of those. When you look 
at pilots in particular, and this has become a critical problem 
for the industry--and by the way, a critical problem for 
smaller communities because this shortfall in pilots is hitting 
the smaller carriers harder than the larger ones. In fact, the 
larger ones are furloughing pilots from the smaller ones more 
and more, which is really--it has affected the Essential Air 
Services program. It has probably now made it much more 
difficult for DOT to keep the subsidized service going in the 
way that they want to, in the way that they must.
    One of the, I hate to say it, but one of the real problems, 
and I say this with enormous respect for the families of the 
Colgan victims, the 1,500-hour rule for training pilots has 
really become an impediment to replenishing the pilot work 
force.
    And I am not a pilot and I don't speak firsthand on this 
issue, but I know an awful lot of people who do, who really do 
claim that expertise. And I have heard consistently that the 
1,500-hour rule doesn't have any relevance to the actual 
performance of a pilot. It had nothing to do with the crash of 
the Colgan Airline.
    And I mean, those pilots had more than 1,500 hours each. 
So, it was irrelevant to the cause of that crash. But it has 
just become--I mean, it is a law and so nobody can do anything 
about it unless the law is changed. But it really is an 
impediment that I think should be reexamined, not because--it 
had no impact on safety--of reexamining it, if you have 
sensible approaches to the training of pilots. The 1,500-hour 
rule, I think, simply departs from that.
    Senator Schmitt. Let me just have a very quick followup, 
which is, in your--in these partnerships that you are seeing in 
the airline industry, what is it that you think is most 
effective? Are these private? Like academies that are being 
created or could be created in the airline industry itself? Or 
is it partnerships with community colleges? What is--just, in 
your opinion, what has been the most effective that you have 
seen?
    Mr. Shane. I think when the airline companies themselves 
create their own academies, and invite people in, and assist 
them in getting through the educational process, which 
otherwise is very, very expensive, there is a loyalty there. 
There is a steady flow, there is a solid job ahead. It provides 
an awful lot of comfort to the candidates themselves and those 
who make it.
    Some wash out, of course, but those who make it are likely 
to be loyal and long-term employees for the industry. So, I 
happen to favor that approach. But there are also third-party 
academies all over the country that have been there for years 
and they work as well. The issue, of course, is what does it 
take for a pilot in particular to actually qualify today? And 
it has become very expensive and, in my judgment, unnecessarily 
so.
    Senator Schmitt. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. Mr. Shane, I could not 
disagree with you more on the 1,500-hour rule. And to quote 
Captain Sully Sullenberger, it would be like saying that we 
don't have enough medical doctors, so let's just cut down a 
number of years of medical school from 4 to 2 and just say, we 
are just going to use our simulators and you are never going to 
touch a patient. That is not the safe way to move forward. I 
would like to go ahead recognize Senator Klobuchar.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. All right. Thank you, Madam Chair. I am 
excited about this hearing. I know many of you so it is good to 
see you. I will note that when Senator Tester was talking about 
the Minneapolis Saint Paul Airport, I agree with him on the 
cost of these tickets.
    But I will say he had a great time because it was just 
voted for the second year in a row as the best airport in North 
America. Just for the record, to my colleagues. OK, so, Dr. 
Moss, quickly. We usually have more time in the Antitrust 
subcommittee. You commented recently about the proposed merger 
of JetBlue and Spirit and how it could hurt both customers and 
airline workers.
    As you know, there has been--DOJ had recent action to sue 
to block the transaction. Do you want to just briefly comment 
about your concerns about this transaction for consumers and 
costs?
    Dr. Moss. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Very good question. 
We do think at the American Antitrust Institute that the merger 
of JetBlue and Spirit is anti-competitive. It will eliminate 
head-to-head competition on a number of routes, dozens of 
routes. It will also eliminate an important low-cost carrier, 
making it easier for remaining carriers in those route level 
markets to coordinate instead of competing hard with one 
another.
    And then finally reduces choice, eliminates choice for 
those price sensitive customers who might want the bundled fare 
fee model that they get with a low-cost carrier. Really no 
compelling efficiencies or benefits coming out of that merger.
    And we already know from previous studies and experience 
that airlines rarely deliver on those connectivity promises.
    Senator Klobuchar. Yes, I care--you know, we are home to, 
or we are a Delta hub. We are home to Sun Country Airlines. We 
are very proud of that airline and is one of the key 
competitors in the smaller market.
    OK, I think I will turn to you, Mr. McGee, very briefly. 
The bill that we have to require airlines to seat families 
together. I am sure Ms. Nelson is aware of this issue as well. 
I know you mentioned this. Do you think airlines are doing 
enough to keep families together? And this is a bill a number 
of us have introduced.
    Mr. McGee. Thank you very much, Senator. We have seen in 
recent weeks, I think, due to the actions by the DOT and 
Secretary Buttigieg to raise the awareness of this and even the 
President, that some airlines in the U.S. have seem to have 
stepped up. We are saying that while we want to applaud them 
for that, it is not nearly enough.
    This needs to be documented through legislation and through 
regulation. What we have found time and again is that the 
airlines contracts of carriage, they are written in sand, 
making them change literally overnight. And so, promises that 
are made by the airlines are not really very valuable long 
term.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Thank you. Mr. Moyers, I was talking 
about airports. We, of course, have concern about the meltdown 
that happened over Christmas with the FAA.
    We just passed out of this committee a bill that Senator 
Moran and I have on improving the NOTAM system and getting the 
stakeholders together, as Representative Stover of Minnesota 
has been carrying it for quite a while in the House, and so we 
are excited it is moving through.
    But of course, it is just a beginning. One of the things 
that we do know is that there are still issues for people who 
work in the airports when it comes to, or on the planes, 
frustrated passengers.
    So, do you want to talk a little bit about what could be 
done to improve those interactions?
    Mr. Moyers. Thank you for the question. And if I understand 
correctly, the interaction between airport staff and----
    Senator Klobuchar. Frustrated customers. Yes.
    Mr. Moyers. We field a lot of phone calls on behalf of 
airlines as the airport operator. And kind of the analogy for 
me is that I run a mall and I have got a bunch of different 
shops in there, but they are calling the mall to complain about 
the x, y, z department store. So, we, we field those calls on a 
regular basis. It is a challenge for us because we are not 
empowered to make decisions on behalf of those passengers.
    Senator Klobuchar. Right. And I think--I mean, clearly the 
best way to do this is to upgrade our air traffic control 
system. We are also going to have weather issues, no one knows 
that better than Minnesotans right now, this winter.
    But I do think that would be the key to all of this. I 
guess. Ms. Nelson, just you have dealt your--flight attendants 
deal with this all the time. Just any ideas that you have along 
these lines.
    Ms. Nelson. Yes. One of the biggest issues is that staffing 
has been cut to minimums on the planes and at the gates. It is 
much harder when we have fewer airline employees to be able to 
address passengers' issues and resolve their problems
    And it's much harder to stop that aggravation from getting 
on the plane, which then can lead to a violent event on the 
plane as well.
    So, we have serious concerns about this. There has been 
cost cutting everywhere, increasing staff, and awareness. And 
interaction between the airlines and the airports is very 
important.
    Senator Klobuchar. My last thing, just back to you, Mr. 
Moyers. Small airports, we have a lot of them. I think every 
member of this committee, looking over there at Mr. Welch and 
Senator Welch with Vermont, and Senator Vance, Ohio, we all 
care about these smaller airports. Could you talk about the 
biggest obstacle in attracting new air service at a small 
airport? Any ideas on that? And quickly.
    Mr. Moyers. Yes, thank you. It is a great question. We try 
to recruit and attract new air service on a regular basis. We 
have folks on retainer that that is their focus--air service 
development.
    The challenge comes down to it is a business decision. I 
can't compel someone enough to start service in a new market 
with what I have to offer as the airport alone, without any 
assistance, whether it is SCADC program or otherwise. Those 
airline incentives that those businesses are looking for, we 
can waive fees, but once--I can't waive something that doesn't 
exist either or where there is only so much that we can give in 
that.
    And so that is the biggest challenge for us, is we are not 
going to beat them with the stick. How big of a carrot can we 
can we use to attract them? And the resources that a small 
airport has when I have got to make infrastructure improvement 
decisions versus an air service, those are the challenges.
    Senator Klobuchar. Well, thank you, all of you. Thanks.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. Senator Vance.

                STATEMENT OF HON. J. D. VANCE, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO

    Senator Vance. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thanks for all 
the witnesses for being here. I want to, before I get into my 
questions, just sort of, you know, kick off by noticing 
something about our country, which is that, you know, it is 
extremely hard to be a parent and extremely hard to have 
families.
    I actually fear that we become an explicitly anti-family 
country in a lot of ways. And you see this in multiple 
different phases. You see this in, you know, the woman who is 
an hour from giving birth and chooses an out-of-network 
anesthesiologist and is then is punished by this by getting 
$15,000 of unexpected bills. And when I think about this as a 
father, after the baby comes, there is maybe no more miserable 
experience than flying with young children in this country.
    And I say that not to blame any of you or any of the groups 
that you represent, but to highlight just how difficult we have 
made it for young families to survive and to thrive in this 
country.
    And I wanted to sort of set that up by asking Ms. Nelson a 
few questions about a policy change that has been advocated to, 
in my view, make it more miserable to fly with young infants, 
which would basically make it impossible for lap infants, for 
parents to bring their babies and toddlers on the plane with 
them sitting in their laps.
    That strikes me as another thing that is going to make life 
unwelcomed on airplanes for children. And I want to just start 
by asking, you know, we--I know this very personally. I have 
had very many babies, some screaming, some not screaming, on 
many flights in my life with my kids, all of whom are under the 
age of six.
    For decades, parents have been flying with babies on their 
laps. They have been doing it in safety. Why are we proposing 
this change that would make it impossible for parents to fly 
with babies and toddlers on their laps now?
    Ms. Nelson. Thank you for the question. This is actually 
more than a 30-year priority for our union ever since the Sioux 
City crash of 1989, when one infant was killed and the other 
three were injured. And the flight attendants were giving them 
instructions about how to prepare for--to keep their child 
safe.
    And in our manuals was an instruction to wrap them in a 
blanket and hold them on the ground. Well, there is no way to--
even the most loving mother and father cannot hang on to an 
infant in that situation. So, we have been proposing this ever 
since that time, that just like in our cars, we need to have a 
safe seat for the infants to sit.
    What I would add to that, though, to that has changed over 
that time until now is that it used to be--when I started 
flying, it used to be that the aircraft was half full and there 
were plenty of seats, and people would bring their car seats, 
and they didn't pay for the ticket, but we would be able to 
find a seat for them, and it was the safest place for the 
infant to be. On the FAA website if you are looking for that 
instruction that is there.
    Our concern is that by not selling those tickets, what the 
airlines are conveying to the families is that it is OK to 
bring your infant on board.
    And my concern is that as safety professionals on the 
plane, understanding that that is not safe for the infant, it 
is not safe in these severe turbulence incidents where the 
children actually become projectiles, that we are not giving 
very clear instructions to parents about how to keep their 
children safe.
    And so, I look at that from both perspectives, both in 
terms of protecting our smallest passengers, but also for 
flight attendants who are charged with the safety, health, and 
security of everyone on board, it is very concerning when we 
are giving instructions that are not as safe. I would only add 
that we don't have any temperature standards on board the 
aircraft.
    And so, in a hot cabin, we actually had an infant that 
passed out, was on his mother's lap. That may have contributed 
to it as well.
    And as parents are leaving the hospital, they are having to 
check out with the fire department or whoever about installment 
of those car seats.
    It is so enforced from the moment that you leave the 
hospital but it is not enforced on our planes, and we are not 
giving that instruction to the families. And there is no place 
to go anymore because the planes are full.
    Senator Vance. So, I appreciate that response, Ms. Nelson. 
And the one thing I would encourage your organization to do is 
maybe to take out how to--look, I don't think this is the right 
rule, but if you guys are going to advocate for this rule, 
maybe to fit it in with some other changes that would make 
things easier on parents as you are advocating for that 
particular approach.
    Because here is the thing. I mean, the difference, of 
course, between an automobile leaving the hospital and an 
airplane, there are two obvious ones that I can think of, 
right. One is that, look, if I take my kids from Cincinnati to 
visit their grandparents in San Diego, that is 5 hours.
    I mean, try to keep a toddler or a baby in a car seat for 5 
hours. That is torture for everybody, including the baby and 
certainly the passengers around the baby. But the second thing, 
of course, is that air traffic accidents are thankfully, thank 
God, so much less frequent and less common than car accidents 
are.
    So, what I worry here is that in the name of safety 
improvements, and I don't doubt that there are marginal safety 
improvements, we are actually proposing a change that would 
make things much, much more miserable for parents, for very 
little marginal improvement in safety. And I want to just one 
final comment here and then I will shut up.
    One thing that I really worry about, and I think both 
Democrats and Republicans should worry about, is we have some 
real demographic problems in our country. American families 
aren't having enough children.
    I think there is evidence that some of the things that we 
are doing to parents is driving down the number of children 
that American families are having. In particular, there is 
evidence that the car seat rules that we have imposed, which of 
course I want kids to drive in car seats, have driven down the 
number of babies born in this country by over 100,000.
    So, as we think about how to make kids safer, I think we 
should do it in a way that is accommodating to American 
families, and I encourage your organization to do that.
    Ms. Nelson. Thank you. I appreciate that. I just want to 
clarify one point, and that is that the child would be required 
to stay in the seat for the critical phases of flight. So, this 
is not keeping babies in a seat for 5 hours.
    Senator Vance. Thank God.
    Ms. Nelson. All right. Thank you.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. And I would have to say, if 
we really wanted to support families in this country, we would 
have universal childcare, we would have paid family leave, and 
we would certainly have universal pre-K.
    However, we could probably talk about working together, 
Senator Vance. Talk to the airlines about maybe having--selling 
a seat at half price so that you could actually--family would 
actually afford to have a separate seat with the car seat for 
their children.
    Senator Vance. Certainly, would be open to that.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. Senator Welch.

                STATEMENT OF HON. PETER WELCH, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM VERMONT

    Senator Welch. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I do agree 
with you. First of all, I fly a lot like all of us do. 
Burlington Airport is great, and I don't know how the flight 
attendants, the personnel there manage to keep smiling when all 
of us passengers are anxious and driving them crazy.
    But they do. It is really a tribute to the folks that are 
on the front lines and the baggage handlers. You know, when it 
is really cold, they are outside hauling the bags and then they 
have to come inside to get the gate checks.
    And it is cold, it is warm, it is cold. So, I just want to 
start out by expressing gratitude to the folks at the 
Burlington International Airport that work for the airlines, 
and the baggage handlers, and all those TSA folks that put up 
with anxious travelers.
    Ms. Nelson. On behalf of all of my colleagues, thank you so 
much.
    Senator Welch. You guys are amazing. There are issues, 
though, that we saw with Southwest where there are corporate 
decisions that are driven by shareholder value. The airlines 
probably do their best to train.
    They nickel and dime a lot of times on staffing and on pay, 
and then the floor falls out from underneath and the passengers 
are left without any help. And I can't imagine what the 
pressure is on the front-line folks in a situation like what 
happened with Southwest.
    So, it really does suggest that there has to be active 
consumer protection and we have to rely on the Government more 
than we rely on the individual airlines to, at the bottom line, 
do the right thing.
    It is why I think Senator Markey's cash refund bill really 
makes a lot of sense. Why shouldn't it be the decision of the 
passenger as opposed to the convenience of the airline to 
determine whether they want cash back?
    You know, and a lot of folks, when they fly, it is not like 
us. We fly all the time, but they are like going to a funeral. 
They are going to a wedding. They are going for a long-
postponed trip to see their brothers and sisters.
    So maybe I will just ask, Dr. Moss. Any reason why there 
can't be cash refunds as a matter of policy at the discretion 
of the passenger as opposed to the convenience of the airline?
    Dr. Moss. Thank you, Senator Welch. That is a great 
question. I see no reason why that policy should not be 
proposed. I would point out that what we have been talking 
about at this hearing today really breaks down into issues that 
fall solidly in the consumer protection bucket, safety, the 
well-being of passengers, issues that fall solidly in the 
competition bucket, which is competition on price and quality 
and innovation in the airline industry.
    Senator Welch. And that goes, of course, to the merger 
question.
    Dr. Moss. Of course. And then we have issues that fall at 
the intersection of consumer protection and competition.
    And those would be things like, well, if you have more 
competition, then you have more pressure on airlines to not 
engage in drip pricing when consumers get online to purchase 
their fares. So, I think that is a really good framework to 
think about this in and frame legislative proposals and 
reforms.
    Senator Welch. Great. Let me ask Ms. Nelson. You know, one 
of the reasons the cash refunds I think are good, there is a 
lot of anxiety for a passenger when their plan is thwarted.
    And it is not the fault of the front-line people, but the 
more security--this is my view, and I am asking you your 
reaction, that family haves, who it is a lot of money to buy an 
airline ticket, especially if it is for a family.
    The more security that family has that they will get their 
money back, they may be disappointed that they can't go to that 
event, but do you think that would alleviate some of the 
pressure on the front-line folks dealing with, you know, really 
upset customers?
    Ms. Nelson. So, it is always better when we have better 
customer service and people's problems are getting resolved. 
That is way better for the people on the front lines. But I do 
want to make clear that there is the ability for a passenger to 
choose to have a refundable ticket. And so, we are talking 
about the nonrefundable tickets.
    Senator Welch. At an expense.
    Ms. Nelson. At an expense, that is right. And so, we are 
talking about the nonrefundable tickets that are--that have 
been put into that segment, tight segmentation of pricing that 
has also been talked about.
    Senator Welch. And you know, I want to go to that. That 
nonrefundable ticket, you know, they have computers, they have 
algorithms. They game it. They know, you know, they have got 
people with eye shades figuring all this out.
    I have never understood why they really need that 
nonrefundable ticket, other than it is a way they can extract 
more money. Because they have the capacity with the computer 
programs to anticipate what sales they have to do, by and 
large, to get their full airplane. I don't know if you are the 
person to answer that, but maybe Dr. Moss is.
    Dr. Moss. The answer is yes. So, the nonrefundable tickets 
are a pure exercise of market power. Because the airlines have 
market power and the ability to control how consumers behave in 
the airline system, they can absolutely impose those types of 
restrictions on them.
    We saw the disappearance of the nonrefundable ticket during 
the pandemic. That is when demand fell off. When consumers were 
in the driver's seat and not the airlines.
    Senator Welch. And I am at the end of my time, but I just 
want to thank the witnesses for talking on behalf of 
maintaining a service in our small airports. Thank you. I yield 
back. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. I recognize Chairwoman 
Cantwell.
    The Chair. Thank you, Chair Duckworth, for doing this 
hearing. It is such an important list of witnesses. Thank you 
all for being here. Mr. Moyer, back to the situation of rural 
communities and our essential air services.
    The Community Air Service Program that you mentioned in 
your testimony, and I think you mentioned you think we should 
fully fund that, and obviously essential programs. But is the 
issue coming down to pilots? Is the issue that airlines--if you 
have a pilot capacity and you can fly from Seattle to Hawaii, 
you probably make a little bit more money on that flight than 
Seattle to Wenatchee.
    And so, what do we do, do you think, because I don't 
think--so, one SCADC focused on the market, and then one 
focused on essential service. What is the best way for us to 
get at this underlying problem?
    Mr. Moyers. I can't disagree with you about a revenue on a 
flight to Hawaii versus to Wenatchee. And that is the 
challenge.
    Those business decisions are being made that marginalize 
the small market. It is hard for me to compete for service in 
Wenatchee versus a service from some other destination where 
there is a greater yield or return on their investment and a 
startup service as well for--to bring new service in, that 
airline is going to incur some costs of bringing ground 
handling equipment, ground crew, the ticket agents, all of 
those expenses.
    They are looking to the airports, how can you help us with 
that startup? And so, there is some questions there as far as 
infrastructure and equipment that I can't answer fully right 
now. That is a big challenge for us in competition in other 
markets.
    From a rural standpoint, I think everyone has agreed that 
everyone deserves accessibility. I don't think there is a 
question there. It is, how do we get to it? The SCADC programs 
are in place right now with I think the last announcement was a 
$15 million.
    Is that enough to go as far as it needs to for enough 
communities to benefit from it, if an applicant is going to ask 
now for a couple of million dollars, whereas before it was $700 
or $800--or $800,000. Those dollars aren't going to go as far 
and fewer markets will benefit.
    The Chair. Well, I guarantee you we did the CHIPS and 
Science bill with our colleagues, Senator Wicker, with the 
notion that we were going to spread out innovation.
    And when you talk about the innovation that is happening in 
Wenatchee, which is amazing, people didn't, probably didn't get 
all the digestion of your comments about being in the diamond 
manufacturing business now. But it used to be an aluminum 
smelter there and now you are manufacturing diamonds.
    And the community decided they wanted to do that. And as 
you said, the community told them that you would have air 
service. And I am pretty sure you probably told Microsoft the 
same thing.
    So, the question is, we are going to hamper economic growth 
and development in other parts of the country--we are going to 
hamper innovation, because innovation can happen in other 
places, but it has to have an airport.
    And I just think we are going to have to figure out, 
working together, how to bridge this gap somehow. So, do you 
think it is back to Essential Air Service then?
    Mr. Moyers. I don't know that it is Essential Air Service. 
I think there are markets where that does make sense. But from 
the standpoint of Wenatchee, I couldn't say that I need 
essential air service. I don't think--we wouldn't fit that 
criteria. There may be places where that is viable. So, to just 
scrap that program, I couldn't sit here today and tell you that 
that would be my suggestion.
    The Chair. OK. Ms. Nelson, thank you for being here. You 
mentioned in your testimony about chaotic scheduling by 
airlines that strain the system. I know a lot of people, I hear 
from our colleagues.
    We are definitely fliers so we hear lots of different 
things about people who capture a market by saying they are 
going to leave every half an hour and then they don't leave 
every half an hour and then they get so congested and backed 
up. But have they captured the market?
    Yes, they just haven't delivered the service. Do you agree 
that DOT should be carefully examining whether airlines are 
publishing unrealistic schedules and leaving workers and 
consumers in a bind? This was the DOT unfair and deceptive 
practices.
    Ms. Nelson. Yes, I agree with that wholeheartedly. And it 
was because of pressure from lawmakers and from DOT that the 
airlines rolled back that unrealistic service this last summer.
    So there needs to continue to be a real transparency on 
that and oversight on that to make sure that we are not 
overpromising, because the people on the front lines are left 
to hold the bag.
    And we also are not getting home to our loved ones. We also 
don't have the infrastructure at the airlines. In some cases, 
they haven't purchased the new scheduling programs that allow 
them to respond immediately, and they don't have the staff 
behind the scenes to be able to pick up the phone.
    So, when the operation falls apart like that, many times 
the people on the front lines are left on hold for five, 6 
hours to try to get through to a scheduler in order to get 
rescheduled. So, it takes the proper investment in 
infrastructure for the airlines, takes the proper staffing, 
both in terms of the frontlines and the backend to support that 
frontline crew.
    And it can't be, as Senator Welch said, just driven to 
share price, because that is what we end up with when that is 
the only objective of the airline.
    The Chair. Mr. McGee, your testimony was clear, so I am 
pretty sure you think that passengers deserve refunds in a 
timely fashion. But do you think we should also up the 
oversight by DOT on this so that you actually are forcing the 
airlines to comply with this?
    Mr. McGee. Yes. Thank you, Senator.
    The Chair. Do we have enough infrastructure to oversee 
that?
    Mr. McGee. No, it is clear we don't. We are in constant 
touch with the DOT and they expressed in 2020 when they 
received a record number of complaints from consumers on 
refunds, a total of some 29,000, that their staff was 
overwhelmed just processing it.
    And understand that is not acting on the refunds, that is 
just processing it. The bottom line is that when you look at 
the refund problem, there are multiple layers to it. One is the 
fact that we do have an existing DOT rule that says you are 
entitled to a cash refund if your flight is canceled for any 
reason, whether it is the airline's fault or not.
    It is clear that U.S. airlines and some foreign airlines 
have blatantly violated that rule, and there has not been 
enough enforcement on that. But an additional problem, sitting 
right behind me is my colleague, Matt Stoller.
    He had a flight canceled last summer. He was entitled to a 
cash refund, he and his wife, and he forwarded me a text from 
Delta Airlines that said, we are sorry your flight was 
canceled. You are entitled to a credit. That is unacceptable. 
In our view, that should absolutely not have happened.
    We live by the fact that about 87 percent of Americans fly 
less than once every 18 months. How are they supposed to know 
these rules? Who knows--now, Matt was lucky enough to have an 
aviation geek on speed dial, so he was able to text me and I 
said, ``WHOA'', in all caps, ``do not accept that credit.'' And 
I gave him the rule. He went to Delta and they said, fine. But 
that is an unfair and deceptive practice.
    And then, of course, we have the problem with the credits 
then expiring. And, you know, Southwest and others have gotten 
credit for not letting them expire. All U.S. airlines should be 
mandated. But, yes, we need more enforcement here.
    The Chair. It would be one thing if you then could get them 
on the phone and talk about it--and they may not even have the 
details of the case. So, then they would just tell you it is 
expired in the news.
    And then you say, no, no, no, I got this because my flight 
was canceled. You gave me this. I should have it. Then you try 
to get somebody on the phone who can--you spend a lot of time 
getting that----
    Mr. McGee. Right. And don't forget that Frontier Airlines 
just shut down its call center. You cannot even call that 
airline. Let's hope that is a trend that doesn't continue.
    The Chair. Thank you, Mr. McGee. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Chairman Cantwell. Now via 
remote, Senator Markey.

               STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD MARKEY, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS

    Senator Markey. Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you, Mr. 
McGee, for your testimony today. I just want to continue on 
this subject because it is the reason why I am fighting to pass 
my Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act. You know, I have 
several Senators on board, and our intent is to get it added to 
the FAA reauthorization.
    So, a little past 2 years, airline consumer complaints on 
refunds have skyrocketed. Last year saw a 1,000 percent 
increase in refund related complaints compared to 2019. In 
other words, there were ten times more refund complaints from 
consumers compared to before the pandemic.
    Clearly, there is an issue here. Mr. McGee, can you briefly 
explain for the Committee how airlines make consumers jump 
through hoops to get their refunds for canceled and delayed 
flights?
    Mr. McGee. Absolutely. And thank you, Senator, and thank 
you for the legislation which we at American Economic Liberties 
Project heartily endorse. You are right, you do have to jump 
through hoops. As I said, 87 percent of Americans fly less than 
once every 18 months. So, the fact is, they are not aware of 
these rules.
    For example, in the European Union, you can't walk more 
than ten yards without seeing a sign explaining what all of 
your rights are. And those are rights that are mandated by the 
union. They are not embedded in airline contracts of carriage 
that I would argue 99 percent of Americans never even heard of 
these contracts that are so binding. So, on the issue of 
refunds, as I was saying, there are multiple layers here.
    As you know, there are airlines that have just blatantly 
said we are not paying refunds. Then you had the situation 
during COVID where there were lockdowns and we were being told 
by local, State, Federal authorities, at certain times by 
President Trump, by the CDC, and medical authorities, you 
should not fly.
    Foreign governments are saying Americans are not welcome 
there. And yet the rule, as written, says that if the flight is 
not canceled, the passenger is not entitled to a refund. Now, 
that was absurd. You had Americans that were immunocompromised 
that could not fly.
    But if you and I were both flying from Washington to 
Chicago and you were on a 10 a.m. flight on United and I was on 
a noon flight on United, and your flight was canceled, and mine 
wasn't, you were entitled to a refund at the height of COVID, 
and I was not. So that is absurd.
    So, we also, of course, appreciate the word cash in your 
legislation. Cash for refunds. As I said, airlines are very, 
very quick to offer credits and vouchers and even sometimes 
mileage in place of cash.
    The DOT rule is clear, you are entitled to cash, but what 
is not clear is airlines every single day do not make that 
apparent to consumers.
    Senator Markey. So, thank you. So, Mr. McGee, you are so 
right. Number one, consumers don't know they are entitled to 
the refunds. Number two, airline slow walk consumers who 
request the refunds.
    And three, airlines will offer flight credits or other 
accommodations in place of cash. And I have been beating this 
drum on this issue for years. In March 2020, right at the start 
of the COVID crisis, I demanded the airlines provide consumers 
refunds for canceled flights due to the pandemic.
    In a May 2021, I pushed the airlines to commit that 
travelers flight credits wouldn't expire. In December 2021, I 
once again demanded airlines provide refunds to their 
passengers as the Omicron variant disrupted--and in front of 
this very committee, I repeatedly asked airline executives to 
provide cash refunds to consumers.
    Each time they have refused to make those commitments. 
These companies are failing to do the right thing, and it is 
time for Congress to act. Mr. McGee, do you agree that Congress 
should pass legislation to ensure air travel consumers receive 
the refunds that they are entitled to?
    Mr. McGee. No question, Senator. American Economic 
Liberties Project heartily endorses it.
    Senator Markey. And that is why I am fighting to pass my 
``Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act,'' which will 
ensure consumers receive cash refunds instead of credits. And 
even before the pandemic, the airlines were tipping consumers 
upside down with unfair and exorbitant fees.
    While the airlines now have grabbed more than $110 billion 
in ancillary fees, including $5.8 billion just for bags on 
domestic flights. Mr. McGee, should Congress pass legislation 
to protect consumers from these continuously rising fees?
    Mr. McGee. No question. The junk fee problem--really, the 
airline industry is the poster child for all that is wrong with 
junk fees.
    Whether we are talking about transparency of fees and the 
airlines have had a problem with this since the dawn of the 
internet, both with mandatory charges, taxes, and fees that 
passengers have no choice about. And with the, ``ancillary 
fees,'' which are much better described as junk fees.
    We also have a problem not just with transparency, but with 
the validity of fees. I testified in the House a few years ago 
alongside five airline executives and Chair DeFazio asked each 
of those airlines, what is your back-end cost on canceling a 
ticket?
    And not one of the executives at those five airlines was 
able to provide a cost. And yet they charge $450, $500, $300. 
This is absurd. So, there are fees----
    Senator Markey. So, we have to end these junk fees, 
including a ban on parents having to pay any kind of fee to 
have their children sitting next to them.
    So, we just had to ban all of this, which is why my Fare 
Fees Act would prohibit airlines from charging those fees for 
bags preceding the cancellation and the change fees that are 
not reasonable and proportional to the cost of the services 
that are provided. And right now, it is just out of control.
    They are just tipping people. Upside down at the counter 
and shaking money out of consumers' pockets. So, thank you, Mr. 
McGee. And thank you, Madam Chair.
    Mr. McGee. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Duckworth. Senator Baldwin.

               STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY BALDWIN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN

    Senator Baldwin. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Ansley, thank 
you so much for being before the Committee today on this 
incredibly important issue and for your tireless advocacy on 
behalf of our veterans in Wisconsin and across the country.
    Despite the original Air Carrier Access Act passing over 35 
years ago, airline passengers with disabilities continue to 
face significant barriers. All too often, travelers with 
disabilities encounter these significant barriers, such as 
damaged assistive devices and wheelchairs, delayed assistance, 
unclear communications, and a lack of on-board accommodations.
    As you stated in your testimony, the Air Carrier Access 
Amendments Act, which is supported by dozens of veterans, 
disability, and consumer organizations, would help to address 
these persistent challenges.
    As this committee considers reauthorization of the FAA, can 
you provide some further background and detail about the need 
to include that particular legislation, the Amendments Act, and 
how it would improve the lives of the millions of passengers 
with disabilities every year?
    Ms. Ansley. Thank you for that question, Senator. The Air 
Carrier Access Amendments Act is desperately needed to provide 
both standards of accessibility for aircraft, but also to 
improve enforcement of the law.
    In terms of improved accessibility standards, I think we 
only have to look at the law and its regulations to see that in 
basically almost four decades since it's been passed, there has 
been no innovation, there has been no improvements and no 
increases in accessibility, not one.
    Second, if we--having participated in efforts to try to get 
lavatories that are accessible on single aisle aircraft, which 
I participated in a negotiated rulemaking in 2016 on that 
particular issue, we have seen that without standards we get 
the catch 22 of well if standards are coming, we don't want to 
do anything because then we might not comply with what the 
standards are.
    So, let's just put out the standards. Let's say we have 
standards for people with disabilities that really mirror--you 
know, we talk sometimes about not wanting to put on airlines 
things that we don't put on other industries.
    This is a situation where airlines are completely exempt 
from something that other industries all have to comply with, 
including Amtrak, Greyhound. There has been--Department of 
Justice has brought cases against ride sharing companies. Not 
airlines.
    Senator Baldwin. You know, you are talking about 
enforcement. And you noted in the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act, 
Congress tripled the fine amounts that could be assessed for 
wheelchair damage or injury to passengers with disabilities. 
But despite this, we have not seen the department assess any 
fines allowed under that provision.
    Despite there being over 1,000 reported cases and 
incidences of damaged or mishandled wheelchairs and scooters in 
December of last year alone. So, as you know, the Air Carrier 
Access Amendments Act would require the Department to assess 
civil penalties for Air Carrier Access Act violations.
    Do you believe the enforcement provision in my bill will 
lead to an improvement for passengers with disabilities, and 
particularly our veterans?
    Ms. Ansley. Yes, we definitely believe that stronger 
enforcement is needed. Many times, we can't even convince our 
members to file complaints because they have filed so many 
complaints that had been found to be valid and yet nothing 
changes.
    So, we need to have certain situations where we say, you 
know what, this merits filing a civil penalty. And then for 
those cases to be sent to the Department of Justice. This is 
not a customer service piece of--in the law.
    This is a civil right that people with disabilities are 
disabled veterans who fought for our country, Senator 
Duckworth, to be able to travel without fear that they are 
going to arrive at their destination and have their legs 
broken, missing, mishandled to--that they themselves are going 
to have been injured simply because they tried to fly to get to 
their job, health care, everything else that we have all talked 
about here today, it is a unique circumstance that no other 
passenger has to deal with.
    Senator Baldwin. Thank you for your powerful testimony.
    Senator Duckworth. Senator Hickenlooper.

             STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN HICKENLOOPER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Madam Chair. I thank all 
of you for being here and for your service. I want to start 
with Ms. Nelson. Severe weather and severe turbulence from 
unexpected and severe weather has caused serious injury to 
passengers and crew. Obviously, we have seen it in news 
stories.
    NOAA collects and processes environmental data to provide 
state-of-the-art weather predictions. A lot of people think 
this is going to continue to expand due to the climate changes, 
is creating exaggerations of wind shear and other causes of 
disturbance--of turbulence.
    Airlines uses data to avoid some sudden episodes of extreme 
turbulence. How would Federal investments to improve weather 
predictions help keep flight attendants and passengers safe?
    Ms. Nelson. If we had better information about the 
potential weather patterns and whether or not turbulence is 
coming, we would have a better ability to protect ourselves.
    So, on the aircraft, when we are flying, actually before we 
take off, when we have the briefing with the flight deck, we do 
talk about weather throughout the entire flight and what the 
forecast is, and determine whether or not it's safe to get up 
right away if we need to stay down for another 30 minutes, 
whatever it is.
    If we have better technology to be able to detect weather 
patterns and weather events, and to be able to detect 
turbulence such as clear air turbulence that is unseen. You 
have no warning for that. Then we have a better ability to 
protect ourselves.
    So, when we are out in the cabin with the 300-pound 
beverage cart and clear air turbulence hits, we are not only 
flying to the ceiling, so is the beverage cart, and it is 
likely coming down on us. I was out of work, actually for a 
couple of months with a similar injury, only moderate 
turbulence though.
    But predicting what the weather patterns are will give us a 
better ability to have that seatbelt sign on, to be able to 
protect ourselves, to be able to stow items away so that they 
are not projectiles in the cabin. And it is critical for the 
safety of everyone on board. And you are right, these events 
have become more and more frequent with the advancement of the 
climate crisis.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right. And I fully expect to see--I 
am beginning to see more keep the seatbelts fastened, making 
sure that keep--we exercise more caution going forward. Mr. 
Moyers, and we talked a little bit about the importance to 
rural communities of air service. How does the lack of that air 
service hurt the economic development in rural communities?
    Mr. Moyers. Senator, great question. Thank you for it. It 
limits our ability to attract new industries to the area. As 
was stated earlier today that we--business relocated to the 
Wenatchee area because of our air connectivity.
    That was one of their factors. As we have seen that service 
diminish over time, that that is a challenge for their people 
to move back and forth from their headquarters.
    The comments that I receive from folks that are business 
owners and operators, is it is adding more time for their 
travel to be able to get to and from that, if they can't 
connect out of their home or where their business is located, 
driving that extra 3 hours to get on a plane in one direction, 
and other three to come back.
    Sometimes that means that they are adding a day on either 
end of their operation to just so it is less efficient.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right. And add a burden. We have in 
Colorado, we have Grand Junction, Durango, even Pueblo have 
restrictions. They have had to cut back on some of their air 
service.
    And in one case, it was after a company had expanded and, 
you know, taken off the space, hired a bunch of people, and all 
of a sudden, they lost their connection. It is a challenge.
    Mr. Moyers. It absolutely is. When we applied for our and 
received our most recent SCADC Grant back in 2018, we had 90 
different businesses and folks that contributed local match to 
the money we received from the DOT. Those are businesses that 
were expecting service to be there. That was 2018. We still 
haven't realized the benefit of that.
    Senator Hickenlooper. It is very frustrating. Mr. McGee--
and there has been a bunch of discussion already about the 
transparency and the issues around junk fees. How would you 
look at upfront price transparency as an enhanced air 
experience for all passengers?
    Mr. McGee. Thank you, Senator. It is a fantastic question. 
The bottom line is there has been a lot of talk about pricing 
today.
    And, you know, there are these statements that have been 
made that pricing, for example, has gone down in the 
deregulated era. Are we accounting for the fact that a full, 
fair ticket 20 years ago included so many services that have 
now been broken out? We do not have a good tracking of that.
    The DOT tracks some fees, but not all fees. What the 
industry calls ancillary fees and what we call junk fees. So, 
we don't even have a sense of the cost of a ticket really in 
large measure.
    So, as I said earlier, there are transparency issues with 
fees in every booking method imaginable, whether through the 
airline, through a third party, through Expedia, online, 
offline. And it is a gotcha situation.
    This is, you know, this is what leads to sticker shock. So, 
you go in and you look, and a family of four looks and says, 
OK, well, $250 each, it is going to be $1,000. And with some 
carriers, it can actually be more, twice as much for the fees 
than for the actual base fare.
    The irony here is that the ultra-low-cost carriers who love 
their fees, they love fees for even carry-on baggage, for 
boarding passes, for things that blow the minds of people that 
haven't flown in a while and they suddenly find out if they pay 
for a boarding pass.
    The irony is, to an extent, I will give the low-cost 
carriers like Spirit a little credit, they are better on their 
websites, of telling people this and warning them. It is the 
largest carriers, in fact, that have the most problems.
    I, in fact, have a copy here from United Airlines website. 
This is called the Baggage Fee Calculator. Now, this is absurd. 
This is one of the largest airlines in the country. And you can 
go on right now and find out what they charge you to check a 
bag. You then have to put in your origin, your destination, 
your date of travel.
    Why? Why can't I know what the costs are ahead of time? It 
is like saying you have to sign to buy a new car, and then 
later they will tell you what the deluxe stereo will cost. It 
is absurd. So, there are so many inherent problems on this fee 
issue with transparency, with the validity.
    But of all the fees, I have to say the absolute worst is 
fees for families with children to sit together. On behalf of 
another organization, we did a Freedom of Information Act 
request, and I spent 3 days reading complaints to the DOT, and 
it included children that were as young as four, three, two, 
and in two cases, 1-year olds that were assigned seats apart 
from their family. Children with autism, with other issues.
    And I think--we have talked a lot about families hidden 
fees, but we are not talking about the origin of it. Why is 
this a--?
    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes--you are going beyond the 
question. So, I appreciate that. I think the key is 
transparency.
    Mr. McGee. No, question that is a big problem.
    Senator Hickenlooper. I don't mind fees, I just think 
people--all businesses, but airlines, especially in this 
context, should be transparent about the fees. Anyway, I yield 
back to the Chair.
    Mr. McGee. Thank you.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. Thank you to all of our 
witnesses for your participation today. The hearing record will 
remain open for 4 weeks until April 20, 2023. Any Senators that 
would like to submit questions for the record should do so 2 
weeks from now, by April 6, 2023.
    We ask that all witness responses be returned to the 
Committee by April 20, 2023, and I do apologize for having to 
gavel out and run, but they called a vote 30 minutes ago and I 
am trying to make it.
    So, thank you all for being here. This was a very, very 
good and productive discussion today. That concludes today's 
hearing.
    [Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

                            A P P E N D I X

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to 
                              Sara Nelson
    Seat Size & Evacuation Standards. A 2016 evacuation of an American 
Airlines flight left one person seriously injured and 20 people with 
minor injuries. The National Transportation Safety Board reported that 
passengers didn't follow flight attendant instructions. The evacuation 
took nearly two and a half minutes--nearly twice as long as it is 
supposed to. Meanwhile, passenger seats continue to shrink: since the 
1990s, seat pitch has decreased from 32 inches to 28 inches and seat 
width from 19 inches to as little as 16 inches. Shrinking seat sizes 
cause health risks, passenger discomfort, and create potential 
evacuation hazards. The 2018 FAA reauthorization law required the 
Federal Aviation Administration to set minimum passenger seat width and 
pitch within one year of enactment. Almost four years later, FAA still 
has not fulfilled this mandate.

    Question 1. Do you agree that establishing minimum-seat size 
standards are important to promoting passenger safety and 
accessibility? Why is this the case?
    Answer. Yes. However, additional research by the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) is needed before defining those minimum dimensions 
to ensure passengers can safely evacuate the aircraft in 90 seconds, 
avoid injuries during an accident, and does not create a stressful 
environment and tension amongst passengers due to the lack of space 
available per person. Additionally the FAA indicated in a 2018 letter 
to Flyer Rights the FAA\1\ stated that seat pitch is unlikely to go 
below 27 inches. That is absolutely the wrong direction on this issue 
and as experts in the aircraft cabin we know this is the wrong 
direction for safety and security. We need to make sure that these 
decisions are based on a proven ability to evacuate the plane in enough 
time.

    The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) participated in the 
Emergency Evacuation Standards Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC), 
that was chartered to assist the FAA in carrying out the requirements 
of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, Public Law 115-254, Sec. 337 to 
review aircraft evacuation certification with regard to emergency 
evacuation system designs and crew evacuation procedures. The ARC 
issued a report in September 2020 and one of the findings is that ``the 
lack of data on the effects of seat pitch and width on evacuations 
inhibits FAA's ability to adequately assess risk due to seat dimensions 
and ensure passenger and crew safety to the extent possible in 
emergency evacuations.'' \2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    AFA also provided written comments in November 2022 to the FAA 
Federal docket (FAA-2022-1001) about the seat size and pitch 
rulemaking. First, regarding safety evacuations as it relates to 
minimum-seat size standards, we noted that in 2021 when the Civil 
Aviation Medical Institute (CAMI) measured \3\ three seat pitches (28-
inch, 32-inch, and 34-inch) which represent the range in the economy 
section on U.S. airlines and two seat widths (16-inch and 18-inch) on 
single aisle aircraft they found that some passengers may not be able 
to safely exit. We recommended to the FAA that further evacuation 
research needs to include a representative range of weights, heights, 
ages, mobility, baggage, and mobile devices, or a correction factor 
must be applied to research findings that are based on a more limited 
range of those factors and environmental factors before applying the 
findings to real-world flights.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Second, we urged the FAA to consider the safest brace position, 
which is defined as the lowest risk of head, neck, and leg injuries. 
This means passengers need to be able to bend their upper body forward 
and grasp their lower. Therefore, seat pitch minima must enable 
passengers who are tall, heavy, or both to assume a safe brace 
position.
    Finally, another safety factor is the negative impact that too-
tight seating can have on passenger behavior. Anecdotally, passengers 
who feel crowded by a small seat pitch may recline their seat back to 
compensate, or they may inadvertently bump the seat in front of them as 
they move in and out of the seat, all of which risks crowding and 
irritating the passengers seated around them. This is problematic 
because of the negative impact that disruptive passengers can have both 
on flight safety and on the personal safety of passengers and 
crewmembers. Economy seating layouts need to ensure an appropriate 
minimum space per person to avoid unwanted and negative interactions.

    Question 2. How can FAA's evacuation standards better take into 
account real-life conditions including the presence of children, adults 
over 60, and passengers with mobility issues, and passengers with 
vision and hearing limitations?
    Answer. The first time we have to conduct an emergency evacuation 
should not be tested out on a real flight with panicked passengers in a 
life threatening situation. This is why simulated testing that 
accurately captures what we see on the planes every day is critical to 
apply when determining whether we can evacuate the plane safely in 90 
seconds.
    Further, the U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General 
(DOT IG) found in 2020 that the FAA's process for updating its 
evacuation standards lacks data collection and analysis on current 
risks. This is why AFA supports Senator Duckworth's legislation, the 
Emergency Vacating Aircraft Cabin (EVAC) Act, to require the FAA to 
promulgate a rulemaking on aircraft evacuation standards that would 
take into account various real-life considerations like you mention, to 
determine if a safe and timely evacuation can occur.

Improving the Overall Flying Experience
    Question. As Congress looks to improve the overall air 
transportation experience for consumers, what are the most important 
considerations to be aware of and how should Congress balance airline 
success, airport operability, competition, and consumer protections?
    Answer. A healthy U.S. airline industry, which supports thousands 
of airports and carries millions of passengers safely to their 
destinations every year depends on a strong and diverse aviation 
workforce. Flight Attendants, pilots, air traffic controllers, TSA 
agents, mechanics, baggage handlers, gate agents, food caterers, 
airport concessions, and many other critical positions that are part of 
the aviation industry workforce ecosystem thrive when we have labor 
contracts in place that protect, workplace rights, and we are 
sufficiently staffed to carry out our duties safely and efficiently. 
Often it is workers on the frontlines who are the greatest advocates 
for consumer protections and the tools to address the needs of 
passengers--diversity on the frontlines creates empathy and 
understanding for the broad range of passengers issues. But union 
protections are critical to empower workers to speak up and press for 
solutions. AFA would encourage Congress to ensure strong labor 
priorities are included in the upcoming FAA Reauthorization bill which 
will improve the overall air transportation experience for consumers as 
well. Here are some of our recommendations:

  1.  Improve cabin air quality on board the airplane

  2.  Regulate cabin temperature

  3.  Require a secure seat for every passenger

  4.  Add Naloxone nasal spray to required equipment on the plane

  5.  Ban violent passengers from flying on any airline

  6.  Increase staffing on the planes and at the gates

  7.  Analyze aircraft emergency evacuation standards to update for 
        today's reality

  8.  Maintain and enhance protections against fatigue

  9.  Update and properly resource EAS

    Interline Agreements. Georgia represents both the world's busiest 
airport and a major U.S. airline, with Hartsfield-Jackson International 
Airport and Delta calling the state home. Recently, a series of high 
profile air travel disruptions, such as the Southwest and NOTAM 
outages, highlighted the need for alternative transportation options 
for travelers faced with extended flight delays or widespread 
cancellations. Considering the vast amount of air travel that comes 
through Georgia, and in order to prevent travelers from feeling 
stranded without recourse, I believe that it is important for consumers 
to have multiple transportation options available when faced with 
delays and cancellations. Agreements between airlines and other modes 
of transportation, such as rental car companies, taxi services, and 
passenger rail are one potential avenue to providing consumers reliable 
alternatives when faced with air travel disruptions.

    Question. Can you speak to the existence and/or prevalence of 
alternative transportation agreements between airlines and other 
transportation providers like rental car companies, taxi services, and 
passenger rail? If they exist, can you speak to the structure of such 
agreements?
    Answer. In Wenatchee, if a flight is cancelled, the airline 
attempts to assist passengers by re-booking them on the next available 
flight, contacting shuttle service providers to assist with passenger 
travel, and/or providing information regarding car rental companies. I 
am not aware of any formal agreements to offer such services. Pangborn 
Memorial Airport is not a participant in any such agreement.

    Question. What potential barriers exist to the establishment of 
alternative transportation agreements between airlines and ground 
transportation companies? What role could an airport play in 
facilitating such an agreement?
    Answer. Potential barriers include issues that cause unforeseen 
ground transportation issues such as vehicular breakdowns, traffic 
accidents, and road closures due to weather. In Washington state, 
wildland fires and avalanche control are regular occurrences that can 
hinder cross-state travel and underscore the need for reliable air 
service. Due to the time and distance required to connect our community 
to a hub airport, for Pangborn Memorial Airport increased air service 
would likely play a more useful role for travelers than alternative 
agreements that rely on ground transportation.
    An airport's role in facilitating an agreement between airlines and 
ground transportation companies is challenging, particularly at a small 
airport like Pangborn Memorial which have limited staffing and 
inadequate space to accommodate shuttle buses at small terminals. The 
role an airport could play is to not unreasonably restrict or impede an 
airline willing to execute an agreement with ground transportation 
companies.
Improving the Overall Flying Experience
    Question. As Congress looks to improve the overall air 
transportation experience for consumers, what are the most important 
considerations to be aware of and how should Congress balance airline 
success, airport operability, competition, and consumer protections?
    Answer. To improve the air transportation experience, Congress 
should help restore air service accessibility in small communities 
nationwide to pre-pandemic levels. Additional funding and greater 
flexibility within the USDOT Small Community Air Service Development 
Program (SCASDP) will help restore air service where communities have 
lost flights since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rural 
airports face acute challenges to provide enough funding to invest in 
their infrastructure. Restoring the Federal share of AIP funding for 
non-hub primary airports to 95 percent, as the Vision 100--Century of 
Aviation Reauthorization Act of 2003 did, would provide much-needed 
additional resources to small, rural airports.

    Improving Fee Transparency. For many air travel consumers, there 
exists a discrepancy between what they believe to be paying for a 
ticket and what they end up paying, when accounting for factors such as 
luggage and who they are travelling with. These discrepancies are often 
not apparent when a consumer is purchasing a ticket and do not become 
known until the consumer is at the airport. The Department of 
Transportation is proposing a rule to improve fee transparency by 
requiring fees to be disclosed as passenger-specific or itinerary-
specific line items when the consumer is purchasing their ticket.

    Question. How do you believe the Department of Transportation 
should approach instituting a fee transparency rule to account for the 
interests of consumers and airlines?
    Answer. American Economic Liberties Project strongly endorses the 
``Forbidding Airlines from Imposing Ridiculous (FAIR) Fees Act,'' which 
would prohibit airlines from charging unreasonable fees: 
www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/in-wake-of-holiday-travel-
chaos-senators-markey-blumenthal-reps-cohen-garcia-khanna-reintroduce-
legislation-to-ground-airlines-skyrocketing-fees
    We believe there are multiple problems with airline fees, which 
President Biden aptly referred to as ``junk fees'' in his recent State 
of the Union address:

  <bullet> some fees are egregious, including the indefensible practice 
        of charging families with children under 13 to sit together 
        inflight

  <bullet> many fees are not at all proportionate to the airlines' 
        costs in providing such services

  <bullet> all fees lack the transparency that consumers require in 
        order to properly budget their travel itineraries without 
        ``gotcha'' costs being added later, contributing to tremendous 
        sticker shock for the actual bottom line price of an airline 
        ticket

    When it comes to transparency, AELP believes that there should be 
full disclosure of ALL airline fares, taxes, surcharges, and fees so 
that consumers receive all this information PRIOR to booking. This 
includes both mandatory charges and ``optional'' junk fees. And such 
disclosures should be made via ALL booking channels--both online and 
offline--whether the ticket is sold directly via the airline or through 
an accredited third-party ticket seller.

    Question. What do you believe the Department of Transportation 
oversight mechanism should look like to ensure airlines are following 
any potential fee transparency rule?
    Answer. For many years and across multiple Administrations, the 
USDOT has failed to adequately identify and address airline fee issues. 
The first problem is that DOT does not even track all the airline 
industry's ancillary revenue from junk fees; currently DOT reports on 
two fee categories--baggage and ticket changes--but some U.S. airlines 
charge 40 or more separate fees. Additionally, the DOT's consumer 
protection staff is overwhelmed and can barely process all the consumer 
complaints about fees and other airline issues, let alone respond to 
them. For this reason, American Economic Liberties Project was pleased 
to learn earlier this month that DOT announced it was hiring additional 
attorneys to assist with this work.
    Also, for many years the DOT has had a poor track on enforcement of 
violations. Regulations are only effective if airlines adhere to them 
and violations are enforced with penalties. Congress should ensure that 
the DOT enforces the rules it imposes on the airline industry.
Improving the Overall Flying Experience
    Question. As Congress looks to improve the overall air 
transportation experience for consumers, what are the most important 
considerations to be aware of and how should Congress balance airline 
success, airport operability, competition, and consumer protections?
    Answer. The air transportation experience has reached new lows in 
recent years, and the lack of competition is at the heart of these 
problems. This competition problem is due to rampant consolidation 
spurred by decades of mergers, acquisitions, and bankruptcies, so much 
so that we are facing unprecedented concerns. There are now fewer 
scheduled passenger airlines than at any time since the industry began 
in the 1910s; there's an oligopoly at the top with just four major 
carriers--American, Delta, Southwest, and United--controlling 80 
percent of the market; and we just endured 14 years (2007-2021) without 
a single new-entrant scheduled passenger airline in the US, the longest 
such draught in history. American Economic Liberties Project believes 
restoring the rights of passengers and providing more competition are 
the two key initiatives. This will benefit not only passengers, but the 
entire ecosystem of commercial aviation, including airports, labor, and 
the cities and regions served by the airlines. AELP has drafted model 
legislation to eliminate airline Federal preemption, so that for the 
first time in 45 years consumers will have the same rights with 
airlines that they do with virtually every other corporation in every 
other industry. State courts, state attorneys general, and state 
legislatures should have the same enforcement authority with airlines 
as they do with all other industries. We are hopeful this legislation 
will be introduced in the coming weeks. Here is that model legislation, 
along with a Quick Take explanation: https://www.eco

eliminating preemption and the FAIR Fees Act detailed above, there are 
other key pieces of legislation that AELP strongly endorses, including:

  <bullet> The ``Airline Passengers' Bill of Rights,'' which among 
        other provisions includes compensating passengers for flight 
        delays and cancellations, mandating minimum seat size

    We also believe that rather than lurching from crisis to crisis, it 
is time to have a national discussion about this vital industry, 
something that hasn't occurred since deregulation took effect in 1978 
(despite several taxpayer bailouts in the interim). It is time to re-
examine how best to regulate the airline industry, and all 
stakeholders--including consumers, airports, workers, labor unions, 
ticket sellers, cities, and regions--should be a part of that 
conversation.

    Accessibility. Commercial aviation is the least accessible 
transportation mode for passengers with disabilities. According to the 
Department of Transportation, 25.5 million Americans age 5 and older 
have self-reported disabilities that limit their ability to travel 
outside of their homes. This means many Americans are cut off from 
career opportunities and visiting their families because flying is 
either not easy or not possible.

    Question 1. Do you believe there is a need to establish a new 
Center of Excellence at the FAA dedicated to making air travel more 
accessible?
    Answer. PVA believes that a new Center of Excellence at the FAA 
focused on accessible air travel could help facilitate improvements in 
air travel for passengers with disabilities. Establishment of such a 
center, however, must not be used as an opportunity to delay action on 
the development of access standards as laid out in the Air Carrier 
Access Amendments Act (S. 545). Disability access standards in air 
travel have already been delayed for far too long. A Center of 
Excellence would need to complement, not replace, that effort.

    Question 2. Given the studies conducted and actions taken since the 
2018 FAA reauthorization, what further research efforts are needed to 
ensure airlines can better accommodate passengers with mobility 
challenges in the next five years?
    Answer. In response to Section 432 of the 2018 FAA Reauthorization 
Act, the U.S. Access Board worked with the Transportation Research 
Board (TRB) on a study to determine the feasibility of in-cabin 
wheelchair restraint systems. In September 2021, TRB released a report 
titled, ``Technical Feasibility of a Wheelchair Securement Concept for 
Airline Travel.'' The TRB study was unable to ``identify any issues . . 
. that seem likely to present design and engineering challenges so 
formidable that they call into question the technical feasibility of an 
in-cabin wheelchair securement system and the value of exploring the 
concept further.'' The study acknowledged that further assessment was 
needed, however, ``particularly to understand how secured personal 
wheelchairs are likely to perform relative to FAA's security criteria 
in restraining and protecting occupants during a survivable airplane 
crash or emergency landing,'' and called on the Department of 
Transportation and FAA to undertake research on these issues. The TRB 
also called on the U.S. Access Board to assess demand from people with 
disabilities to fly while seated in their wheelchairs to inform the 
number of aircraft that would need to be modified to provide meaningful 
access, assuming remaining feasibility questions are satisfied.
    We believe that the 2023 FAA Reauthorization Act should require the 
Department and FAA to follow through on the next steps as identified in 
the TRB report. If the remaining issues are addressed in a way that 
does not call into question the technical feasibility of the concept, 
the 2023 FAA Reauthorization Act should also require the Department to 
promulgate regulations implementing requirements for in-cabin 
wheelchair securement.
    The 2023 FAA Reauthorization should also require the Department of 
Transportation to move forward with a study recommended by the Air 
Carrier Access Act Advisory Committee on the design of aisle chairs and 
the use of lift devices to improve the transfer process for wheelchair 
users. Specifically, the Committee recommended ``a study on the design 
of aisle chairs and the use of lift devices such as the Eagle Lift to 
improve the process of aisle transfers for passengers who use 
wheelchairs and, in that process, consider how these devices may impact 
the safety of individuals who provide physical assistance.'' Aisle 
chairs are designed to meet the needs of the aircraft aisle and not the 
individuals who must use them. These devices are extremely narrow, 
often in disrepair, cannot be independently propelled, and have little 
or no padding. According to the Committee, the purpose of such a study 
would be ``to gather important data that could improve the transfer 
process for passengers who use wheelchairs.'' It could also lead to the 
development of aisle chair specifications.

    Question 3. Accessibility is more than just a consumer issue for 
passengers in wheelchairs. An injury from an improper transfer or a 
damaged wheelchair can endanger the passenger's life, health, and 
independence. Can you describe the critical importance of designing 
aircraft to allow for passengers to roll aboard in their wheelchair?
    Answer. Airlines must be required to operate aircraft that meet the 
needs of passengers with disabilities, particularly wheelchair users, 
because of the inherent safety risks of disability-access barriers. 
During the preboarding process, wheelchair users have to travel to the 
bottom of the jetway in their own customized wheelchair. It is on this 
sloped area that they must transfer from their personal wheelchair into 
an aisle chair, which is a small, narrow wheelchair. This device has no 
means of self-propulsion. Some individuals are able to perform the 
transfer independently, others need the assistance of air carrier 
personnel. Air carriers use several different types of aisle chairs to 
assist passengers with mobility impairments during the boarding 
process. Often these aisle chairs are poorly designed and in disrepair. 
In some cases, the aisle chair can cause harm because it does not have 
proper padding, which can lead to skin abrasions, bruises, or sores.
    The assistance from personnel in trying to coordinate the transfer 
and the slope of the jetway can make this a precarious procedure. In 
our experience, air carrier personnel and contractors are not properly 
trained on how to physically lift/transfer a person from a wheelchair 
to an aisle chair. They are also too often unfamiliar with the 
securement straps. Once securing the passenger, assistants must 
traverse the aisle chair backwards into the plane, down the narrow 
aisle, and then transfer the passenger from the aisle chair into the 
passenger seat.
    Upon entering the plane, accessibility diminishes rapidly. The 
aisle width of the plane is typically smaller than that of the 
individual being transported on the aisle chair. This means that 
passengers are bumped and scraped from row to row to get to their seat, 
wherever that might be on the aircraft. Despite requirements for 
disbursed removable armrests to facilitate transfers, aircraft 
consistently have fixed armrests in first and business classes of 
service, making the process more difficult.
    Once preboarded, the rest of the passengers enter the plane. Those 
that are seated in a wheelchair user's row, have to climb over them if 
the individual is seated in the middle or aisle seat. This causes 
further discomfort and aggravation to the wheelchair user and the other 
passengers. Upon getting to the destination, the deplaning process is 
similar to the boarding process. The wheelchair user is the last person 
off the plane no matter if it is their connector city or final 
destination. Sometimes, the aisle chair is delayed.
    In addition to the difficulties that passengers with limited 
mobility face in boarding the plane, they must also worry about the 
stowage of their assistive device. Damage to a wheelchair can be a trip 
altering event as well as pose significant health concerns for the 
passenger who depends on it for mobility. Customized wheelchairs are 
not easily replaced if damaged.
    Wheelchair users must be able to avoid this entire process by being 
able to fly while seated in their device. This would increase their 
safety by protecting them from injuries in the boarding/deplaning 
process and ensure that their assistive device is not damaged. At the 
very least, wheelchair users should have access to a passenger seat or, 
if feasible, a wheelchair spot adjacent or next to a boarding door. 
This would allow the individual to avoid the aisle chair.
    Buses had to be modified to safely and efficiently accommodate 
wheelchairs. Airplanes should be no different and Congress must require 
the Department of Transportation to develop accessibility standards, 
including the ability to board and, if feasible, fly from a customized 
wheelchair. Otherwise, the current safety risks and loss of dignity 
encountered by wheelchair users will never be fully addressed.
    Until wheelchair users are able to safely board and deplane using 
their own wheelchairs, they should have access to first row/front of 
cabin seating at the price of an economy ticket. This would save their 
bodies from the injuries that occur when they have to be dragged 
through the plane to their section and decrease the amount of time they 
spend on an aisle chair. It would also likely mean more room and would 
save the wheelchair user from being climbed over by their fellow 
passengers.

    Improving the Flying Experience. I believe that it is important for 
consumers to feel safe and comfortable during their flying experience 
on an airplane. Part of that is ensuring all passengers can access a 
lavatory and that any and all equipment a passenger needs, like a 
wheelchair, is safe from the moment a passenger gets to the airport 
until the moment they reach their destination.

    Question. In your testimony, you highlight that a majority of 
Paralyzed Veterans of America survey respondents avoid air travel 
unless absolutely necessary due to a lack of lavatory access. As the 
Department of Transportation works on rulemaking surrounding accessible 
lavatories, what are some considerations that would allow for a more 
efficient and robust implementation of any potential rule?
    Answer. The Department of Transportation's proposed rule meets a 
pressing need to provide accessible lavatories on single-aisle 
aircraft, and the Department should publish a final rule as soon as 
possible. Given the severity of the need and the Department's delay in 
publishing it, PVA's comments on the proposed rule urged the Department 
to shorten the extended implementation timelines agreed to as part of 
the negotiated rulemaking held in 2016. Specifically, the Department 
should use its authority, to the extent possible, to subtract the six-
year delay in promulgating the proposed rule from the deadlines for 
compliance, as doing so would be consistent with the understanding of 
the participants in the negotiated rulemaking. And the Department 
should reject any arguments to delay implementation based on cost or 
design because the costs of further delay outweigh any implementation 
costs.

    Question. In your testimony, you also highlight issues related to 
staffing and training for airline workers that help wheelchair-bound 
passengers navigate on and off the airplane. What do you believe needs 
to be included in the training provided to these workers? What role do 
you envision Congress playing in the development and implementation of 
wheelchair assistance training by airlines?
    Answer. In order to ensure a safe and dignified air travel 
experience for passengers with disabilities who use mobility devices, 
it is imperative that wheelchair attendants be fully trained and able 
to subsequently demonstrate to a superior on the job their ability to 
properly assist a passenger throughout the airport, as needed, and on 
and off the aircraft. This means the attendant has a proficient 
knowledge of how to safely use the aisle chair, including the use of 
all straps, brakes, and other safety features. The attendant must also 
be proficient in the use of techniques to assist in the transfer of 
passengers to and from their wheelchair, the aisle chair, and the 
aircraft's passenger seat, either by physically lifting the passenger 
or deploying a mechanical device for the lift/transfer. But most of 
all, wheelchair attendants must be able to effectively communicate and 
take instruction from the passenger. Disabled passengers know what 
their personal needs are and how to best assist them. Only when 
wheelchair attendants have completed all training, which must be hands 
on, and successfully demonstrated that training on the job to a 
superior should the attendant be considered ready to assist someone who 
must board or deplane using an aisle chair. Furthermore, attendants 
should be required to complete refresher training every six months and 
be recertified yearly on the job by a superior in order to remain 
qualified for providing aisle chair assistance. Attendants must also be 
trained on how to ensure that after each use the aisle chair is in 
proper working order, cleaned as needed, and stowed so as to be readily 
usable by the next passenger.
    Congress should include language in the upcoming FAA 
Reauthorization directing the Department to move forward with its 
pending regulation, ``Ensuring Safe Accommodations for Air Travelers 
with Disabilities Using Wheelchairs'' (RIN 2105-AF14). In addition, 
Congress should require that the Department's rule meet our suggested 
training requirements.
Improving the Overall Flying Experience.
    Question. As Congress looks to improve the overall air 
transportation experience for consumers, what are the most important 
considerations to be aware of and how should Congress balance airline 
success, airport operability, competition, and consumer protections?
    Answer. The most important consideration for Congress must be to 
ensure that passengers with disabilities, particularly wheelchair 
users, have safe and dignified access to air travel. The systemic 
discrimination in air travel against passengers with disabilities is 
evident in the lack of lavatory access; the number of lost, damaged, or 
delayed (mishandled) wheelchairs and scooters; and the injuries 
wheelchair users regularly receive in the boarding and deplaning 
process. No other group of passengers faces such treatment in 
commercial air travel. Many wheelchair users report being treated like 
a piece of luggage--an inanimate object--during the boarding and 
deplaning process.
    Despite the focus in the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act on improving 
air travel for passengers with disabilities, the percentage of 
wheelchair or scooters mishandled by large domestic airlines was 
exactly the same in 2022 as it was in 2019. Unless Congress takes 
decisive action by implementing a requirement for accessibility 
standards for aircraft and improving enforcement of the Air Carrier 
Access Act by including the Air Carrier Access Amendments Act (S. 545) 
in the upcoming FAA Reauthorization, the situation of passengers with 
disabilities will not improve.

   Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Tammy Duckworth to 
                            Jeffrey N. Shane
Topic: Market Failure for Passengers with Disabilities
    Question. In your written testimony, you claimed that there is a 
role for regulation where there is a market failure. Specifically, you 
stated that ``There is clearly scope for beneficial regulation in 
circumstances where market forces can't be expected to resolve an 
issue. The Air Carrier Access Act has made things better for disabled 
passengers, for example, but we can and should do more.''

  <bullet> Can you explain why the market has failed passengers with 
        disabilities and why you feel it would be appropriate for the 
        FAA to take additional measures to enhance accessibility?
    Answer. Thank you for your question and the opportunity to 
elaborate further. The Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-435) 
and significant appropriations dedicated to improving access in the 
airport environment have been of great benefit to individuals with 
disabilities--including those using wheelchairs and other mobile 
devices. Thanks to the ACAA and rules issued by the Department of 
Transportation, even aircraft cabin interiors now accommodate disabled 
passengers more effectively than before, with moveable aisle armrests, 
accessible lavatories on wide-body aircraft, in-cabin wheelchair 
storage, and other features. Without minimizing the importance of these 
improvements, however, others can and should be pursued to realize more 
fully the goal of non-discrimination against passengers with 
disabilities.
    Two significant barriers to air travel by people who use 
wheelchairs continue to compromise the quality of their experience. 
First there is currently no way a passenger can board an aircraft in a 
personal wheelchair and remain in that chair during the flight. Second, 
the loading and unloading of personal wheelchairs into cargo holds--
particularly motorized chairs which are very heavy--too often result in 
damage that renders the chairs unusable until repaired. Moreover, 
without the proper equipment and training, airline baggage handlers are 
themselves often in danger of injuries due to the heavy weight and 
bulkiness of some chairs.
    I am confident that no airline wants to deny passengers with 
disabilities the right to fly. As Congress understood in passing the 
ACAA, however, this is one area where the cost of ``doing the right 
thing'' simply can't be recovered by market forces. Every airline in 
our deregulated and highly competitive air travel market knows that it 
would place itself at a significant economic disadvantage vis-a-vis 
competitors by making the significant investments required to mitigate 
these problems beyond what they have done to date. Accordingly, the 
airline industry, left to its own devices, cannot reasonably be 
expected to make further progress on its own. Because there is no 
effective, market-based incentive to improve the experience of disabled 
passengers, Federal regulation is required to create standards that are 
applied and enforced across the board so that every competitor is 
placed in the same position and none can benefit by failing to do the 
right thing. Equally important, regulation would create a robust 
incentive for the development and manufacture of the equipment 
necessary to improve the experience of passengers who use wheelchairs 
and reduce the damage to chairs that so many travelers have 
experienced.
    Despite the improvements in the airport and cabin realized to date 
thanks to Federal regulation and investment, virtually no Federal 
resources have been devoted to research and development into ways for a 
passenger to board an aircraft in their own wheelchair and, when 
properly secured, remain in that chair for the duration of the flight. 
Indeed, the only significant work on the technical side of this issue 
is currently being conducted by a non-profit organization, All Wheels 
Up, which relies entirely on charitable donations.
    Section 432 of the FAA Authorization Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-254) 
required a study by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers 
Compliance Board (``Access Board'') to determine the feasibility of in-
cabin wheelchair restraints. The Access Board, in turn, commissioned a 
study to be done under the auspices of the Transportation Research 
Board, an arm of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and 
Medicine. That study was completed in 2021 and involved a wide range of 
experts from manufacturers, air carriers, consumer groups, engineering 
organizations, unions, and other relevant categories. The detailed 146-
page report was thoroughly peer-reviewed. The committee that prepared 
the report summarized its findings as follows:

        ``After reviewing the available information. . ., the committee 
        did not identify any issues in this preliminary assessment that 
        seem likely to present design and engineering challenges so 
        formidable that they call into question the technical 
        feasibility of an in-cabin wheelchair securement system and the 
        value of exploring the concept further. While the report's 
        analyses and findings suggest that equipping enough airplanes 
        with securement systems to provide meaningful levels of airline 
        service would require substantial effort, the types of cabin 
        modifications required to provide the needed space and 
        structural support would likely be of moderate technical 
        complexity for many individual airplanes. Further assessments, 
        including efforts to fill the information gaps identified in 
        this report, would appear to be warranted, particularly to 
        understand how secured personal wheelchairs are likely to 
        perform relative to FAA's safety criteria in restraining and 
        protecting occupants during a survivable airplane crash or 
        emergency landing. The committee believes that such follow-on 
        assessments are warranted because the many feasibility issues 
        that could indeed be assessed using the information at hand 
        appear to be manageable from a technical perspective. Concerted 
        efforts to understand the remaining technical uncertainties 
        through more focused analysis and testing, as described in the 
        recommendations offered. . .by the committee, would enable more 
        informed public policy decisions about the feasibility and 
        desirability of in-cabin wheelchair securement systems.''

    On the basis of these conclusions, it is clearly time for Congress, 
in the reauthorizing legislation it must enact by later this year, to 
give the FAA explicit authority to accelerate follow-up research and 
development into viable wheelchair restraint systems, taking full 
advantage of work already done. If the results of this work demonstrate 
the feasibility of systems consistent with established airworthiness 
requirements, the FAA should be authorized to promulgate standards for 
the manufacture and installation of such systems as well as for the 
manufacture of the associated wheelchairs. The legislation should 
prescribe completion by a date certain. Assuming such systems can 
indeed be certified, the legislation should require the FAA to 
establish appropriate mandates for the installation of such systems in 
all new aircraft. If the retrofitting of existing aircraft is found to 
be technically and economically feasible, retrofitting should also be 
required on a phased basis. The end result would be a far more 
satisfactory travel experience than passengers with disabilities are 
having today and a fuller realization, at long last, of the goals of 
the Air Carrier Access Act.
    Finally, with respect to the problems related to loading and 
unloading of conventional wheelchairs in cargo holds, mechanical lifts 
are available that should be deployed more widely. If even a small 
portion of the airport infrastructure funds recently appropriated were 
used for the purchase of such equipment, it could be made available to 
airline baggage handlers on a shared basis. With a modest amount of 
training, the use of such equipment would reduce or eliminate both 
damage to wheelchairs and injuries to airline workers.

  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Raphael Warnock to 
                            Jeffrey N. Shane
    Interline Agreements. Georgia represents both the world's busiest 
airport and a major U.S. airline, with Hartsfield-Jackson International 
Airport and Delta calling the state home. Recently, a series of high 
profile air travel disruptions, such as the Southwest and NOTAM 
outages, highlighted the need for alternative transportation options 
for travelers faced with extended flight delays or widespread 
cancellations. Considering the vast amount of air travel that comes 
through Georgia, and in order to prevent travelers from feeling 
stranded without recourse, I believe that it is important for consumers 
to have multiple transportation options available when faced with 
delays and cancellations. Agreements between airlines and other modes 
of transportation, such as rental car companies, taxi services, and 
passenger rail are one potential avenue to providing consumers reliable 
alternatives when faced with air travel disruptions.

    Question. Can you speak to the existence and/or prevalence of 
alternative transportation agreements between airlines and other 
transportation providers like rental car companies, taxi services, and 
passenger rail? If they exist, can you speak to the structure of such 
agreements?
    Answer. Thank you for the interesting question. Regrettably, I have 
no personal knowledge of such arrangements. I wonder, however, given 
the average distance of most domestic flights within the U.S., whether 
many passengers would opt for a bus or rental car, or even rail where 
it might be available. Where weather is the cause of the disruption, 
travel in any mode might not be advisable. And in a great many cases, 
arrival at a passenger's destination is likely to be sooner through a 
rebooking on the airline than through surface transportation, even 
after a night in a hotel. There are certainly relatively short-haul 
flights for which ground transportation might be a feasible option but, 
again, I am not aware of any existing arrangements in that regard.
    The Southwest meltdown near the end of last year prompted a 
discussion of whether airlines should be required to provide seats for 
their passengers on other airlines in the event of a cancellation. 
While well-intentioned, this seems like a wholly impractical 
suggestion. One of the great successes of our deregulated market is 
that load factors on most carriers and on most flights are quite high. 
No longer do we waste fuel by flying half-empty airplanes, as was often 
the case prior to 1978. The consequence of this more efficient 
utilization of aircraft, however, is that even if there were a 
requirement that an airline with a cancellation find seats for affected 
passengers on another carrier, it probably wouldn't be able to do so.
    The more important goal of public policy, I believe, is to 
establish a structure for the operation and consistent modernization of 
our air traffic control system that minimizes disruptions. There will 
always be unexpected reasons why a flight has to be canceled, but such 
cancellations should be few and far between.

    Question. What potential barriers exist to the establishment of 
alternative transportation agreements between airlines and ground 
transportation companies? What role could an airport play in 
facilitating such an agreement?
    Answer. I am not aware of any barriers to the establishment of such 
arrangements, although, as suggested in my answer to the previous 
question, I think passengers are not likely to treat ground 
transportation as an acceptable substitute except in the case of 
relatively short-haul flights. Where, for example, bus transportation 
is provided in lieu of air transportation, passengers would expect a 
refund of the difference between the air fare they paid and the cost of 
a bus ticket.
    Airports clearly have an interest in not having their terminals 
filled with stranded passengers and therefore have an incentive to 
encourage the establishment of such arrangements where they might be 
viable. Their role would be limited to that of a broker and 
facilitator, however. The actual establishment of such arrangements, 
however, would require willing parties.

    Improving Fee Transparency. For many air travel consumers, there 
exists a discrepancy between what they believe to be paying for a 
ticket and what they end up paying, when accounting for factors such as 
luggage and who they are travelling with. These discrepancies are often 
not apparent when a consumer is purchasing a ticket and do not become 
known until the consumer is at the airport. The Department of 
Transportation is proposing a rule to improve fee transparency by 
requiring fees to be disclosed as passenger-specific or itinerary-
specific line items when the consumer is purchasing their ticket.

    Question. How do you believe the Department of Transportation 
should approach instituting a fee transparency rule to account for the 
interests of consumers and airlines?
    Answer. DOT has long required that airlines disclose all applicable 
fees prior to purchase. The following statement is from DOT's website

        It is relatively easy to compare ticket prices using the 
        Internet (through airline websites, online travel agencies, 
        etc.). DOT requires airlines and travel agencies that display 
        ticket prices to advertise the total price that a consumer must 
        pay to purchase a ticket. Wherever an airfare is advertised, 
        such as on a website, in an e-mail, or during the booking 
        process, the fare price must include all applicable government 
        taxes and fees, and any mandatory carrier-imposed surcharges.

    DOT also requires that baggage fees, if any, be similarly 
disclosed. Its website explains this requirement as follows:

        Airlines are required to provide information about their 
        baggage fees through: (1) a clear link from the airline's 
        homepage to a page or place on the airline's website that 
        displays all of the airline's baggage fees and other optional 
        service fees, and (2) a link on the first screen that appears 
        with a fare quotation for a specific itinerary.

    Despite the extraordinary level of transparency already required of 
airlines (to the best of my knowledge, no other provider of a product 
or service is required by the U.S. government to display an ``all-in'' 
price (including taxes), DOT has wrestled with further requirements 
over most of the past decade. A brief history of this effort 
illustrates how an agency can be whipsawed by the competing policies of 
successive administrations.
    In 2014, during the Obama administration, the Department issued a 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled ``Transparency of Airline 
Ancillary Service Fees and Other Consumer Protection Issues.'' 79 Fed. 
Reg. 29970 (May 23, 2014). Following its receipt of ``significant 
comments,'' DOT later issued a Supplemental NPRM entitled 
``Transparency of Airline Ancillary Service Fees,'' published on the 
last full day of the Obama administration. 82 Fed. Reg. 7536 (Jan. 19, 
2017).
    At the end of that same year, during the Trump administration, DOT 
withdrew the Supplemental NPRM, noting correctly that existing 
requirements already provided consumers information regarding fees for 
ancillary services. 82 Fed. Reg. 58778 (Dec. 14, 2017). DOT also noted 
that the withdrawal was consistent with President Trump's Executive 
Order 13771, ``Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs.''
    On January 20, 2021, immediately following his inauguration, 
President Biden issued Executive Order 13992, revoking Executive Order 
13771, among others.
    President Biden later issued Executive Order 14036, ``Promoting 
Competition in the American Economy'' (July 9, 2021), which apparently 
encouraged DOT to pick up where it had left off in its quest to make 
airline pricing even more transparent than it already was.
    Accordingly, last October DOT issued yet another Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking, once again entitled ``Enhancing Transparency of Airline 
Ancillary Service Fees,'' 87 Fed. Reg. 63718 (Oct. 22, 2022). The 
comment period closed last December 19 and DOT is presumably 
deliberating now over next steps.
    My own view is that the only current deficiency in the transparency 
of airline pricing relates to families traveling together, and only on 
some airlines. Too often, merely to ensure that they will sit next to 
their child--even if not in a premium seat--parents have to purchase 
seats in advance for a price that can be avoided by passengers having 
no such need. Parents should not have to pay more for the ability to 
sit next to their children unless they wish to sit with their children 
in premium seats that any passenger would be required to pay for. 
Recognizing that this has become the source of a great many customer 
complaints, some airlines have already begun to address the issue. The 
pending NPRM would require clearer disclosure of airline policies 
regarding family seating, which seems like an appropriate first step. I 
believe that all airlines need to address the issue quickly and 
satisfactorily or a more intrusive solution is likely to be imposed on 
them by DOT.
Improving the Overall Flying Experience
    Question. As Congress looks to improve the overall air 
transportation experience for consumers, what are the most important 
considerations to be aware of and how should Congress balance airline 
success, airport operability, competition, and consumer protections?
    Answer. Thanks for thoughtful question. In my view, Congress has 
already done the most important thing possible in the interest of air 
transportation consumers: it passed the Airline Deregulation Act of 
1978. That legislation, nothing less than a miracle of public policy, 
revolutionized and democratized air travel. Most economists maintain 
that the benefits to consumers from the inter-airline competition 
enabled by the ADA have been enormous. We not only enjoy lower fares, 
but also a variety of airline models, from full-service airlines to 
ultra low-cost airlines.
    As a direct result of the affordability engendered by that 
legislation, the vast majority of Americans have flown and have strong 
opinions about the airline industry. Members of Congress, who fly more 
than most, also have strong opinions. The temptation to tamper with the 
wholly private, market-based airline business through legislation and 
regulation can therefore be powerful.
    Unless the issue is one that we can't reasonably expect to be 
solved by market forces, reinforced by DOT's long-standing transparency 
requirements, it is a temptation that should be resisted. It would be 
inappropriate for Congress to second-guess airline managers on most 
customer issues. We can trust competition to deliver optimal results.
    There certainly are issues that we can't reasonably expect to be 
solved by market forces. The experience of disabled passengers, for 
example, notably those using wheelchairs, continues to fall short of 
the goals expressed in the Air Carrier Access Act (Pub. L. 99-435), and 
thus is one such issue. The difficulty smaller communities experience 
in attracting adequate scheduled air service, exacerbated since the 
pandemic by a serious shortage of pilots, is another. Ironically, 
Congress unnecessarily exacerbated the pilot shortage by enshrining a 
1500-hours-of-flying requirement in law as a prerequisite to obtaining 
a commercial pilot's license, despite the widespread view of experts 
that there are better and far more efficient ways to train a pilot.
    There is another way that Congress can and should enhance the 
experience of aviation users: separate the Air Traffic Organization 
from the rest of the FAA. First, the FAA would regulate our air traffic 
control system at arm's length, as opposed to treating it as a member 
of the family. Second, by being unshackled from the annual 
appropriations process, the ATO would be able to pursue further 
modernization in a far more efficient way, financing improvements 
through debt in the way other large, capital intensive, technology 
driven entities do, with lower costs in the bargain. If our national 
air space were managed more efficiently by an entity not hamstrung by 
government procurement and civil service rules and the always uncertain 
appropriations process, consumers would enjoy a far more satisfactory 
experience.
    The bottom line is that, other than in a pandemic or some other 
catastrophe that suddenly dries up the air travel market (e.g., 9/11), 
Congress need not worry about the success of airlines. Let them take 
care of themselves. The Bilateral Infrastructure Law provided a welcome 
infusion of funds to airports, and we are already seeing improvements 
in a a number of cities. The Department of Justice has ample authority 
within the antitrust laws to ensure that the market remains highly 
competitive, and DOT has ample authority in Title 49 to protect other 
interests of consumers. Congress should take enormous satisfaction from 
the work it has already done. Efforts to do more--beyond addressing the 
issues I have mentioned (accessibility, service to small communities, 
FAA reform)--are not likely to end well.

      Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ted Cruz to 
                            Jeffrey N. Shane
    Question. One major airline--United Airlines--has said that last 
year, over a four-month period, 40 percent of its flight delay minutes 
and 75 percent of its cancellations were due to the FAA's air traffic 
management. The FAA has been painfully slow to modernize its air 
traffic systems and improve efficiency in the airspace, as was evident 
with the recent NOTAM failure.
    a. Do you believe consumers would be better off if the FAA were to 
spin off the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) into a private 
organization, where it can more quickly improve technology and 
services?
    Answer. I appreciate the question. The benefits from spinning off 
the Air Traffic Organization--whether to a wholly private organization 
or even to a government corporation unshackled from the annual 
appropriations process--are probably incalculable. Those benefits would 
of course flow to consumers, but also to airlines, to air traffic 
controllers, and indeed to the government itself. It is simply 
impossible to find a coherent justification for the current structure, 
given its conspicuous deficiencies.
    Of all of the networks America depends upon for its prosperity and 
economic growth--including water and sewer services, 
telecommunications, electricity, railroads, natural gas, broadband, 
home entertainment--only one, our air traffic control system, requires 
annual appropriations from Congress before money can be spent.
    Imagine for a moment that the United States had set up its air 
traffic control system as a not-for-profit corporation at the outset. 
It has always been funded by user fees, it has long enjoyed access to 
the bond market, and it has consistently managed upgrades in keeping 
with the pace of technology and pursuant to a disciplined capital 
budget. Specifically, it has financed upgrades through debt with no 
uncertainty as to the availability of funds, thereby ensuring the 
greatest possible value for money.
    Now somebody comes along and proposes that, despite its success, we 
abolish that organization and place responsibility for air traffic 
management within the FAA. Our premier aviation safety regulator would 
now be dual-hatted as a provider of air traffic services as well. No 
borrowing authority, a newfound fealty to Federal procurement and civil 
service rules, and with funding based on a complicated assortment of 
taxes and fees, made available only to the extent authorized and 
appropriated by Congress regardless of how much money those taxes and 
fees have actually generated. Perhaps the strangest anomaly of all is 
that there would no longer be arm's-length FAA regulation of the air 
traffic organization's safety performance. It would now be ``part of 
the family.''
    It seems pretty clear that a proposal to change the imaginary 
structure I've described to the structure we actually have would be 
rejected out of hand. It's not easy to understand, therefore, why we 
cling to that structure so slavishly.
    The FAA rightly deserves credit as a global leader in the 
regulation of aviation safety. Indeed, its long history of assistance 
to foreign governments has undoubtedly contributed to the enhancement 
of flight safety everywhere. It is notable, therefore, how many of 
those other governments today have rejected the FAA's organizational 
structure and removed air traffic control from the purview of their 
aviation safety agencies. The Eno Center for Transportation wrote in 
2017 that more than 60 countries have removed ATC responsibility from 
the agencies responsible for aviation safety, many placing it entirely 
outside of government. The results have been consistently positive.
    It should also be noted that the FAA's current structure is 
inconsistent with the recommendations of the International Civil 
Aviation Organization, despite ICAO's long history of respecting the 
standards and protocols adopted by the FAA. Specifically, in its Safety 
Oversight Manual (Doc 9734), ICAO writes that ``[c]lear distinction and 
separation of authority and responsibility between the state regulatory 
authority and the State operating agency should be maintained.''

    b. If the FAA is currently failing to enable aircraft to fly more 
efficient flight paths, thereby wasting time and fuel, the benefits of 
a more efficient ATO seem to include reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
from airplanes. What other benefits might one expect from a more 
efficient ATO?
    Answer. Since the launch of the NextGen modernization program in 
2004, the FAA has certainly made important progress in enabling 
aircraft to fly more efficient flight paths. The complaint by some 
observers that it is taking too long to ``complete'' NextGen falsely 
assumes that there is a clear end state that will represent completion. 
The NextGen initiative was launched in recognition of a need to 
accelerate the adoption of available technologies that promised both 
greater efficiency and even greater safety. It has achieved much of 
what was envisioned but is an ongoing process of improvement that 
should continue for as long as the technology of air traffic management 
continues to evolve. Management of the national air space today 
requires the Air Traffic Organization to address a host of challenges 
that weren't issues in 2004--integrating uncrewed vehicles into the 
system and accommodating frequent space launches with minimal 
disruption of scheduled air traffic.
    That is not to say, however, that NextGen has been as efficiently 
managed as might have been possible in a more sensible structure. The 
Air Traffic Organization is a complex, capital-intensive, technology-
driven enterprise that simply cannot be managed optimally by an agency 
that has to compete for funding with other elements of government, 
first within the Executive Branch and then through the Congressional 
appropriations process. That the FAA's budget for facilities and 
equipment today is at approximately the same level as it was in 2009 
speaks volumes about why we don't yet have a state-of-the-art system.
    It should be no surprise that improvements in the management of air 
traffic have taken too long to adopt, frustrating airlines and air 
travelers alike. A more efficient and nimble ATO--unshackled from the 
constraints of the appropriations process--would clearly be in a 
position to deploy future improvements on an accelerated timetable at 
lower costs than the FAA currently incurs. Those improvements would not 
be limited to the actual management of air traffic, but also to the 
ATO's internal systems themselves. The NOTAM system shutdown this past 
January was undoubtedly attributable, at least in part, to insufficient 
attention to maintenance and ensuring adequate capacity to operate 
smoothly during periods of peak traffic.
    A more fit-for-purpose structure for air traffic management would 
clearly be more efficient at delivering improvements that currently 
remain in the pipeline for too long, thereby enhancing the reliability 
of schedules, minimizing disruptions, engendering a less stressful 
experience for air travelers, and of course delivering an even safer 
system in the bargain.
    Of equal or greater importance is the conflict-of-interest issue. 
Please understand that it is not my intention to criticize in any way 
the stalwarts who go to work every day and devote themselves to 
maintaining the safest aviation system in the world. Despite a 
structure that clearly compromises its ability to deliver progress in 
real time, the FAA is a great agency, characterized by a justly proud 
culture, and populated by a cadre of dedicated public servants who 
deserve our gratitude. I collaborated closely with the FAA for many 
years while in the Office of the Secretary of Transportation and was 
consistently impressed with the dedication and competence of the people 
I worked with. It was an honor to be their colleague.
    Still, we have begun to see some fraying around the edges of the 
system. There were a number of worrisome near-catastrophes earlier this 
year that observers have attributed to complacency--either on the part 
of pilots or controllers. It is fair to assume that arm's length safety 
regulation of the Air Traffic Organization by the FAA--in a structure 
in which the two organizations are entirely separate from each other--
would enhance further the quality of safety in our air transportation 
system. Separation would change the conversation. In my answer to the 
previous question I referred to the preponderance of countries that 
have separated air traffic management from safety regulation as well as 
ICAO's guidance in that regard. There are good reasons to be concerned 
about maintaining a system in which our aviation safety regulator is 
also a provider of air traffic services. The public interest would 
unquestionably be better served if the two functions were wholly 
separated in keeping with what has become an international norm.
