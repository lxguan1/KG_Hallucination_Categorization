                                       U.S. Senate,
          Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met at 10:14 a.m., in room SD-538, Dirksen 
Senate Office Building, Hon. Sherrod Brown, Chairman of the 
Committee, presiding.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERROD BROWN

    Chairman Brown. The Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Committee will come to order.
    I am excited to hear today what public transit means to 
people in Cleveland, Ohio, in Greenville, South Carolina, and 
in Baltimore, Maryland. Thank you to the witnesses for being 
here. But before that, I want to say a few words about the 
people of East Palestine, Ohio, and the aftermath of the 
Silicon Valley Bank collapse.
    They both have one thing in common. Companies followed the 
Wall Street business model, obsessed with short-term profits, 
at the expense of everything and everyone else. They were aided 
and abetted by corporate lobbyists and the politicians here who 
do their bidding, weakening rules meant to protect the people 
who we serve. And now, working people in Ohio and around the 
country pay the price.
    As the Nation now knows, East Palestine is a tightknit town 
in Columbiana County, near the Ohio River, near the 
Pennsylvania border, which once made 80 percent of all the 
ceramics in this country, before those jobs, like so many in my 
hometown of Mansfield and others, moved overseas, because 
companies pay less overseas.
    This town, and neighboring communities in Beaver County, 
Pennsylvania--Senator Fetterman, a Member of this Committee, 
this is the State he represents--are the kinds of places that 
are too often forgotten or exploited by corporate America.
    Now these Ohioans are worried about whether their water is 
safe to drink, whether the air is safe to breathe, whether 
their beef cattle can now sell a side of beef, whether their 
kids will get sick, and, of interest to this Committee, what 
happens to the value of their homes. All because of a train 
derailment caused by a corporate culture of cutting corners and 
cutting safety rules.
    Norfolk Southern chose to invest much of its massive 
profits in making its executives and shareholders wealthier, at 
the expense of the Ohio communities along its rail tracks like 
East Palestine, Steubenville, where there was a derailment, 
Sandusky, where there was a derailment, Springfield, 200 cars 
derailed since East Palestine.
    The company followed the Wall Street business model: boost 
profits and its stock price by eliminating more than a third, 
38 percent of its workers over 10 years, and then spend $3.4 
billion on stock buybacks last year, and were going to do more 
when this accident happened, instead of investing in its 
workers and investing in safety.
    Senator Vance and I have come together to introduce our 
Railway Safety Act, to make trains safer as they go through 
communities like East Palestine. We are working with the 
Commerce Committee to move that legislation forward quickly. 
For decades, the railroads have lobbied to undermine safety 
rules. They are fighting basic requirements--basic requirements 
like having two drivers, two engineers, two pilots, if you 
will, on these trains. Two-and-a-half-mile-long trains, 200 
cars, the railroads want only one human being on that train, 
driving it. Think of that. The railroads think that a train 
that is more than two miles long only needs one crew member.
    We know what it is about--cut costs to boost profits, 
something you cannot do in your jobs, and the communities along 
their routes be damned.
    It is the same story with Silicon Valley Bank, and we will 
have hearings about that soon. For as long as we have had big 
banks, they have had too much power in this town. Think of two 
of the most powerful lobbyists in this town for 100 years, the 
banks and the railroads. It is how we got the financial crisis 
of 2008 that wiped out workers' savings and permanently set 
back an entire generation of young Americans.
    But of course Wall Street did not change its ways. Wall 
Street banks spent the ensuing years lobbying to roll back 
safeguards we passed in the wake of that crisis. The now-
defunct Silicon Valley Bank spent hundreds of thousands of 
dollars pushing for exemptions for banks like this.
    Their CEO, who came to testify, who now is, I guess, 
unemployed, sort of, said that they should not be subject to 
strong guardrails because of, quote, the ``low-risk profile of 
our activities and business model.''
    ``Low-risk profile.'' His words.
    We all know what they really wanted to do--maximize 
profits, risks be damned.
    Now look what has happened. The paychecks of thousands of 
Ohioans--I talked to the leaders of these companies--were at 
stake last weekend because of these Silicon Valley executives' 
arrogance and incompetence.
    When we let corporations run the economy, workers and their 
families always pay the price, whether they are in Cleveland, 
whether they are in Maryland, whether they are in South 
Carolina, they always pay, whether it is for the greed of 
Norfolk Southern or Silicon Valley Bank or Big Pharma or Big 
Oil.
    There is a pretty simple question at stake in everything we 
do in these jobs: Whose side are you on? Do you stand with 
corporate lobbyists or do you stand with communities like East 
Palestine? Do you stand with Silicon Valley executives and 
venture capitalists or do you stand with small businesses? Do 
you stand with Wall Street or do you stand with workers?
    It is the same fight, over and over and over again.
    As this Committee looks at how to respond to this latest in 
the long line of financial industry incompetence and greed, I 
hope my colleagues will put partisanship aside, as Senator 
Vance and I are doing on rail safety, to stand with the people 
we serve.
    Turning to transit, our Committee worked on a bipartisan 
basis to include, as the three of you know, the biggest 
investment in transit ever in the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law.
    Better transit means new zero-emission and low-emission 
buses. I have talked to the CEO of the RTA in Cleveland, and 
she is so on top of that, and it really matters. It means 
faster, safer service so that more people can get to the 
doctor, to the grocery store, to work, to church. It means more 
opportunity for all the communities that have been ignored and 
exploited for so long, whether it is a Black community or brown 
communities, whether it is small towns or rural areas, or all 
of the above. I have worked with Senator Rounds a lot. He 
understands rural transit perhaps better than anybody on the 
Committee, with the work he does with Senator Smith. Both have 
major rural areas in their Upper Midwest States.
    I am looking forward to working with Ranking Member Scott 
on transit issues. Today we have witnesses today from both of 
our home States.
    We will hear how the Cleveland RTA is improving their bus 
and rail services for riders in replacing decades-old railcars. 
The RTA has been planning their investments in new railcars for 
many years, and because of the work we did on the 
infrastructure law they are finally going to be able to get 
better cars and newer, cleaner buses, and Ms. Minor, thank you 
for nodding as I am saying that.
    Cleveland is also home to the HealthLine on Euclid Avenue, 
one of the best bus rapid transit corridors in the country, and 
they are joining other transit agencies in Ohio to expand that 
faster service. I live in the city of Cleveland. I see the kind 
of service they are giving.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry is deeply committed to attracting new 
workers to the transit industry--2,000 employees she has, that 
is the club estimate number--and to ensuring those workers have 
the training they need.
    I am also interested to hear how Greenlink will grow in the 
years ahead to meet the mobility needs of Greenville, South 
Carolina. Thank you for being here.
    And we are lucky to have the President of the Amalgamated 
Transit Union's Baltimore local 1300. Mr. McMillan has been an 
important partner to the Committee in making transit safer for 
riders and workers. Mr. McMillan, thank you for how you honor 
the dignity of work and fight for your workers.
    We have an opportunity this Congress to listen to local 
voices, Senator Scott and the like to do that, and to learn how 
to help more Americans enjoy high-quality transit service.
    We begin that work today.
    Senator Scott.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TIM SCOTT

    Senator Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I start my 
comments on Silicon Valley Bank and the failures there, I would 
like to acknowledge the fact that today I get to share this 
hearing with Mr. Keel from my home State of South Carolina. I 
look forward to hearing the testimony of all three witnesses.
    But, Mr. McMillan, I realize that just last night at 
midnight, the issue of public safety and transit safety came 
home. One of your bus operators was stabbed twice--twice--last 
night. I am sure you were up through the night, focusing on the 
issues that you care most about--the safety of your operators. 
So sorry to hear about the devastating news that seems to be 
repeated too many times in too many places around this country.
    The safety of our transit system is a major question and a 
major failure that we need to address. Thank you for being here 
this morning, because I cannot imagine how difficult it is to 
show up here when your thoughts and your heart has to be with 
your operators. But more importantly, I cannot think of a 
better time to be here to talk about the issues that have such 
a drastic and strong impact than to talk about it today at the 
Banking hearing. So, thank you for being a part of this 
Committee this morning. Thank you for participating, and 
certainly our prayers and our thoughts are with your operators.
    As it relates to the failure of the Silicon Valley Bank, 
there is no question that the failure should be seen through 
the three prisms. One is the failure of the bank executives and 
the board. They were betting on interest rates going down when 
there was a clear sign from the Fed that interest rates were 
going up, not one time, not two times, not four times, not six 
times, but eight increases. And the bank management and the 
board sat there, idly by, doing nothing. That is a travesty and 
has had a devastating impact on our financial systems.
    The good news is our financial system remains strong. It is 
well-capitalized, and frankly the rules that have been in 
place, the laws that have been passed are, in fact, doing its 
job. The challenge, of course, is when regulators refuse to do 
their jobs and enforce the laws. The law is not the problem. If 
you pass more laws and more regulators do not do their jobs, 
what good is the law? We have seen this way too often. The 
regulators were literally, or figuratively, asleep at the 
wheel.
    We see that playing out throughout the SVB failure, 
Signature failure, and other bank failures. We know that the 
San Francisco Fed failed twice. Obvious issues of liquidity 
rising. JPMorgan in November of last year indicated that 
without any question, the situation at the Silicon Valley Bank 
was dangerous. A financial blogger in December saw what the 
regulators refused to see, which was the dire situation, not 
developing, already in place--already in place--at SVB. And yet 
our regulators did absolutely, positively nothing. When we had 
an opportunity to ask about the last time an examination 
happened at the bank, our regulators could not answer the 
question.
    We look at the incredible explosion of inflation 
devastating our Nation in every single State. And what we see 
is, as inflation rises really fast, to a 40-year high, the 
Fed's responsibility is to try to tame the inflationary effects 
in our economy. What does that look like? It looks like 
interest rates going up very quickly, so fast that the 
securities portfolio at SVB was in the wrong position and the 
management decided to do nothing.
    A failure of the bank, a failure with the regulators, and 
without any question, a failure at the top, which is the 
President of the United States, that created an inflationary 
effect that we have not seen. So it led to the fastest increase 
in interest rates we have seen in more than three decades. That 
combination is devastating to American families, but more 
importantly--this is the part that I want to make sure we do 
not miss--the average person in our country has a bank balance 
of around $5,000. And those folks, because of the actions of 
the regulators and this Administration, will now be bailing out 
those who had balances of $5 million. Some will say ``It is not 
a bailout. It is not a bailout. It is not tax dollars.'' Well, 
according to the law, the special assessment fee that will be 
imposed upon banks could be as high as $220 billion. Banks do 
not print money. The Fed prints money, but banks do not print 
money. So who bears the burden of that special assessment, 
whatever it turns out to be? It is everyday account holders, 
who have to pay higher interest rates and/or pay higher fees 
associated with the policies or the products they purchase at 
these banks.
    And this bank was an anomaly, without any question. But 
when the regulators are asleep, and the inflation is a 40-year 
high, and the Fed goes to work, bad things happen to everyday 
Americans. So, let us not simply think about this from the 
perspective of the bank, which they needed to be closed, action 
needed to happen, but the question is, is the action of this 
Government imperiling more Americans with very few dollars in 
their accounts, comparatively speaking, to the venture 
capitalists that this Administration has decided to insulate?
    To our hearing today. Maybe some of you do not realize 
this, but I served on the county council a number of years ago. 
I spent 13 \1/2\ years in local government. It was the most 
remarkable experience one might ever have. It gave me an 
opportunity not only to be the chairman of the county and to 
prepare for natural disasters, like hurricanes, but it also 
gave me an opportunity to serve on the board of directors of 
CARTA, which is the Charleston Association of Transportation in 
the area of Charleston, South Carolina.
    So I spent a number of years on and off the board, and one 
of the things I realized is that mass transportation is a local 
issue--fundamentally a local issue--and local issues need local 
solutions.
    I look forward to having a conversation about how we can be 
helpful in this conversation, but I want us to not lose the 
point that mass transit is very different in each one of our 
States, very different in each one of our communities even in 
our States. Charleston needs are very different than Greenville 
needs. So they may have some similarities but the one thing 
that none of us have, as far as I can tell--please raise your 
hand if you have a lot of extra money hanging around somewhere 
on the balance sheet with nothing to do with it--giving extra 
priorities, whether it is ESG, whether it is electric vehicles, 
without actually the resources to deliver on the mandates is 
irresponsible.
    Our Federal Government continues to provide more mandates, 
more challenges, and no actual answers or actionable items to 
change the trajectory of local transit except for to cost more 
money.
    The right to choose the right ridership, the right routes 
is a difficult one, in and of itself, challenging to make sure 
that the passengers are on the vehicles at the best times, the 
peak times, and not the buses or the trains running empty--real 
challenges that you have.
    The challenges of managing a local transportation system 
are immense. What you do not need are more unanswered 
questions. You do not need those. You need more solutions, and 
we need to have more trust and confidence in the way that you 
manage your systems.
    I look forward to hearing your testimony. I look forward to 
having a conversation about some of the solutions that you all 
want us to take into consideration. I look forward to having a 
conversation about safety. That is of paramount importance that 
we spend too little time talking about it. We see it on the 
news, but we do not personalize the issues. These are everyday 
Americans trying to make a living and provide a much-needed 
source of transportation. And yet, too often they feel unsafe, 
not just the riders, but the operators. So, I look forward to 
hearing your testimony. Thank you for being here.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Ranking Member Scott.
    I want to introduce today's witnesses. Ms. India Birdsong 
Terry serves as CEO and General Manager of the Greater 
Cleveland RTA, Regional Transit Authority. She joined RTA 3 \1/
2\ years ago and brings more than 15 years' experience working 
in the public transit industry. She served as the COO of WeGo 
public transit in Nashville.
    At RTA, Ms. Birdsong Terry oversees 2,000 employees, the 
largest transit system, by far in Ohio, almost twice the size 
of Columbus' or Cincinnati's. She has provided exceptional 
leadership to RTA by advancing innovative solutions to improve 
service and coverage for Cleveland area riders. She continues 
to expand RTA's role in economic development in the region. It 
is not clear what I heard a minute ago but she will, among 
other things, talk about the massive Federal investment in 
infrastructure, in capital, and what it means to riders in 
Greater Cleveland.
    Mr. James Keel serves as Greenlink's Public Transportation 
Director, the city of Greenville, South Carolina's Public 
Transportation Department. He concurrently serves as the 
Executive Director for GTA--I guess I can call it that--which 
provides public transit services throughout Greenville County. 
He began his public transit career as a bus operator for East 
Carolina University Transit in Greenville, and he has managed a 
Charter Services Unit before joining Greenlink.
    Mr. Michael McMillan is President of the Amalgamated 
Transit Union's Local 1300 in Baltimore, and I join the Ranking 
Member in expressing my sympathies and challenges that the 
Ranking Member did about your driver. Local 1300 represents 
more than 2,200 active frontline operations and maintenance 
workers in the Maryland Transit Administration. He served as a 
bus operator for MTA for a decade and a half before becoming a 
subway operator, which he did for another 7 years. Always 
active in the Union, Mr. McMillan was elected as President of 
Local 1300 4 years ago and is now serving in his second term. 
Thank you for all you do to promote the dignity of work.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry, you are recognized. Thank you.

 STATEMENT OF INDIA L. BIRDSONG TERRY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
    AND GENERAL MANAGER, GREATER CLEVELAND REGIONAL TRANSIT 
                           AUTHORITY

    Ms. Birdsong Terry. Good morning. As mentioned, thank you 
so much Chairman Brown and, of course, Ranking Member Scott, in 
addition to the Members that are here, Mrs. Britt. It is my 
pleasure to be able to serve testimony this morning, to be able 
to talk about the items that were mentioned by both of you 
regarding public transit and the state of the future for that 
particular industry in this country.
    GCRTA is a legacy, multimodal transit system, providing 
bus, heavy rail, light rail, bus rapid transit--which is our 
moniker--as well as paratransit, servicing approximately 
100,000 customers daily. Our agency's annual operating budget 
stands around $324 million, and our annual capital budget 
varies between $100 million and $120 million per year.
    As mentioned, we are very proud of the fact that we are the 
largest public transit agency in Ohio, and we do also provide 
passenger rail services to those residents of our region, and 
we are in a state of good repair, which I will go into in a 
little bit here.
    We do have a new mission statement, and I wanted to be able 
to explain that a little bit because it is very simple. We 
really transitioned from a technical mission statement--
everyone wants our service to be clean, on time, friendly, all 
of those basic tenets of public transit--but we have got to be 
able to elevate our industry beyond just the norm. And to do 
that we really thought about what makes us come to work every 
day, and we landed on ``Connecting the Community.'' It sounds 
very simple and basic to your ear when you first hear it, but 
when you really deep dive into what that means it allows us to 
support the diverse interests of Greater Cleveland.
    Understanding that public transportation is the connective 
tissue between neighborhoods and citizens, it is no surprise 
that the most frequent trips taken on GCRTA, otherwise known as 
RTA, are comprised of journeys to work, 60 percent; school, 23 
percent; and roughly 9 percent in the balance to healthcare 
opportunity. And that really gets to supporting the mental 
health items that are mentioned by the unfortunate incident in 
Baltimore last night.
    Understanding that we are a legacy public transportation 
system, RTA faces a tremendous hurdle, and we are not alone. 
Keeping up with our aging infrastructure, state of good repair 
needs, is paramount. This most basic need is not only a facet 
of our daily operations at the garage level but it is a 
customer experience every day. We understand that we have to be 
clean, safe, and flexible, but it is being more difficult on a 
daily basis as our infrastructure ages with time.
    So enter in the passage of the IIJA, or the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act. This particular grant funding 
availability is instrumental in our ability to manage the 
reasonable expectations--and I say reasonable because it is 
reasonable, and those are the tenets of the customers we have. 
They want to have something clean. They want to have public 
transit that is accessible. They want to feel safe. It is our 
duty, as mentioned by Ranking Member Scott as well as Chairman 
Brown, that we have to be able to show up, and show up every 
day, and provide those basic tenets of service to those that 
need it most. And those are on the backs of the men and women 
who serve our country, and we particularly saw the essence of 
that during the pandemic. We had to be able to get them to work 
so that the rest of us could survive.
    Simply put, the historic increases in Federal transit 
funding are essential and are making a huge impact in Greater 
Cleveland. We thank you for the investment in RTA and the 
residents we serve. The IIJA increased RTA's annual formula 
funds by 30 percent over the next 5 years. We are ready to be 
able to act. This includes work on our Waterfront Line Bridge 
that serves downtown, many residential and entertainment 
districts, as well as our Vehicle Replacement Program for our 
rail system.
    Our railcars average between 38 and 41 years of age. This 
is way beyond the acceptable rate of use for their life. They 
typically age out for railcars around 35 years. We currently 
have raised $213 million toward overall program, an estimated 
$393 million for the entire program, and hope to be able to 
bridge the gap.
    We also have a lot of different programs going on that I 
will elaborate on during the Q&A if possible, for Low-No 
Emission and also the ADA Accessibility Program.
    Public safety is paramount, where we have partnered with 
our local unions on the PTASP program, which we will talk 
about, in addition to a Civilian Oversight Board, Transit 
Ambassador Program, and a plethora of other mental health 
programs. We also continue to talk about workforce and how we 
can become a force in the economic driver of Cleveland.
    With that I appreciate the time today, and I look forward 
to being able to answer questions on the many programs of the 
Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority. Thank you.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Ms. Birdsong Terry.
    Mr. Keel, welcome.

STATEMENT OF JAMES C. KEEL, DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, 
                           GREENLINK

    Mr. Keel. Good morning. Thank you, Chairman Brown and 
Ranking Member Scott for this opportunity today to talk about 
Greenville, South Carolina, and the Greenville Transit 
Authority.
    If you have not heard of Greenville, we are located in 
between Charlotte, North Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia, and 
what we are really known for is our downtown. We have a 
beautifully curated downtown. We just opened a new 60-acre 
park, so green space is something that we care a lot about.
    We were actually voted 1 of the 10 best cities to buy a 
home in just this year, and our economy is booming. Greenville 
County currently has about 550,000 residents, and we are 
expected to expand by about 220,000 by 2040. So people are 
moving to South Carolina. Last year, South Carolina was the 
third-fastest-growing State in the country.
    But our transit system is smaller. We have about 12 fixed 
routes, provide 18 hours of service a day on the weekday, and 
10 hours on Saturday, covering 94 square miles. During the peak 
of the pandemic our ridership decreased 44 percent, which is 
small in comparison to that of some agencies, and in a radical 
move our board decided to actually increase service, adding 4 
more hours of service per day, really to help out those shift 
workers. Our essential workers in South Carolina are very 
important to us.
    Last year, in 2022, we saw a ridership increase of 17 
percent on fixed routes, and our paratransit service increased 
54 percent.
    South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce 
actually looked at really what are the barriers to 
transportation in South Carolina, and actually public transit 
is one of the top five issues that is currently facing our 
State. We kind of consider ourselves ahead of the curve on that 
though, because in 2018, we did a robust transit development 
plan looking at how we need to grow to make sure Greenville 
County does not get behind that curve. This includes later 
hours, increased frequencies, and 15 additional routes, and by 
the time hopefully all of this is done by 2030, 73 percent of 
the jobs in Greenville County are going to be within a one-
half-mile walk of the routes that we have in place.
    Last week, a local group put together an economic impact 
study from a professor at the University of South Carolina and 
found that the investments of the TDP will actually increase 
economic activity in Greenville County between $670 million and 
$2 billion annually.
    That said, there are three major issues that we are kind of 
looking at as we move forward. One, GTA does not actually have 
a dedicated revenue stream. There is no penny or property tax 
that is providing any kind of funding source for us. So it is 
the city and the county that are providing us budget subsidies 
every year. As a matter of fact, our operating budget is 
supposed to increase by 14 percent as we move into fiscal year 
2024, and this is largely due to a 12 percent increase in bus 
operator salaries that is being driven by inflation. So 
although there are monumental increases to 5307 funding, the 
majority of those funds are just going to be to deal with the 
inflationary issues that we are currently facing.
    There are also some new requirements in BIL that we quite 
frankly do not care for. The Zero Emission Fleet Transition 
Plan, to be able to apply for low- and no-emission funding is a 
concern, given the fact that we actually first adopted our 
first electric vehicles in 2018, and have another award and are 
having five more Proterra vehicles delivered hopefully early 
next year.
    The other major issue that I wanted to at least mention, as 
far as Greenville is concerned, is the pandemic was challenging 
for us and the number of individuals that we are experiencing 
right now that have some sort of mental illness or homelessness 
is at a record that we have not been prepared for; and like 
most in the industry, need help understanding the best way to 
deal with it and move forward.
    That said, out of our fleet of 27 fixed-route vehicles, 4 
are battery electric. We intend to work toward having a fully 
alternative-fueled fleet of electric and compressed natural 
gas. We have concerns about strictly being electric, mostly as 
it relates to the emergency preparedness that we value in South 
Carolina.
    We have got a new operations and maintenance facility that 
will hopefully be online early next year. We actually have a 
RAISE grant right now that we have to hopefully add Compressed 
Natural Gas and have the solar panels added, and this also 
would allow us the ability to expand into hydrogen in the 
future.
    That being said, we greatly support the increases to public 
transit funding and look forward to the questions in this 
hearing. Thank you.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Mr. Keel. I will save the 
questions for later, but are your bus drivers union or not? 
They are not?
    Mr. Keel. We are not union.
    Chairman Brown. OK. Thank you.
    Mr. McMillan, welcome. Glad that you are here.

 STATEMENT OF MICHAEL McMILLAN, PRESIDENT, AMALGAMATED TRANSIT 
                        UNION LOCAL 1300

    Mr. McMillan. Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Mr. 
Ranking Member, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for the 
acknowledgement of our injured, assaulted operator and also for 
this opportunity.
    I would like to focus on three areas that the IIJA is 
already improving transit in Baltimore, Maryland: funding, 
safety, and workforce development.
    As far as funding goes, we have gaps in our transit system 
throughout Baltimore. For many MTA riders, there are no direct 
routes for service to get to good-paying, reliable jobs. 
Sometimes, and for most of Baltimore city residents, they do 
not own a car, and a lot of times their commute to the job, to 
good-paying jobs, is over an hour. With the help from the IIJA 
we hope to finally build a rail line to connect east and west 
Baltimore by rail. This connection will help low-income 
neighborhoods to good job centers in Baltimore.
    Secretary Buttigieg announced last summer that $26 million 
in IIJA funds will be used to upgrade our Penn Station in 
Baltimore, and we are certainly grateful for that.
    We also need more covered bus shelters and bus stops to 
comply with the ADA for our riding passengers. We have a 
tremendous need, capital needs, in Baltimore. Thanks to the 
work of this Committee, Baltimore's annual formula funding 
under the IIJA will exceed $200 million from now until 2026. 
This is a tremendous help to our transit system.
    We can and will do better. Ridership is starting to bounce 
back also after the pandemic because it had slowed down due to 
it. The funding from the IIJA is going to help MTA build back 
better.
    When it comes to safety, we are grateful for Senator Van 
Hollen, the chief sponsor of the Transit Worker and Pedestrian 
Protection Act, and also to Members of this Committee who 
cosponsored that legislation and fought to get it included into 
the infrastructure bill. You have saved countless lives and we 
are saving a lot more with this funding.
    In my full testimony we will tell the stories of my friend, 
Marcus Parks, a bus operator, who was shot over 10 times and 
was killed while on the job. Also a friend, Ms. Francine 
Merritt, a train station operator who was severely beaten, in 
which she could not even remember the attack the next morning 
when she wound up in the hospital. And as you heard, another 
friend, Mr. Keith Braswell, Badge 620, he has been with MTA for 
over 15 years, attacked last night. He was stabbed once under 
his arm and once in his buttocks by a disgruntled passenger. 
These things have to stop.
    It is a regular day on the job for the transit industry, 
and it is a wonder why we have a bus operator shortage now. It 
takes a special person to do the job of operating in a public 
transit system. The IIJA sets up labor management safety 
committees with equal numbers on both sides, to deal with 
assaults and safety issues facing the U.S. transit industry.
    In Baltimore, we are working with our management as a 
partnership. We have developed 14 seats for our Joint Safety 
Committee. We have 7 for labor and 7 for management, and we are 
doing good work in this area.
    Unfortunately, transit systems throughout the Nation are 
pushing back on labor and requirements of this law. More than 
one-third of the ATU bargaining units report that management 
has not established a Joint Safety Committee. We will have 
transit agencies falsely claim that they have not covered by 
the IIJA. Managers are attempting to appoint union committee 
members themselves and claims that management's preexisting 
safety committees are enough.
    Dozens of agencies have ignored the FTA's deadlines to form 
committees and update their safety plans. It is incredibly 
disappointing and puts lives at risk. The FTA is relying on the 
ATU to determine which agencies are not in compliance with this 
law, but it is a work in progress.
    Finally, our workforce development. We are going to see the 
changes in transit soon. The State of Maryland has passed a 
bill that changes most of its diesel vehicles and hybrid 
vehicles to zero emissions by the year 2030. ATU fully supports 
this change, and we are grateful for Congress providing 
billions of dollars in the IIJA to make this happen. The issue 
is that only half of our members are currently skilled enough 
to do this work, so training is needed. We are thankful that 
this Committee and the Biden administration has required 5 
percent of the low-no funding to be used by transit systems to 
fund workforce development, training, including registered 
apprenticeships and labor management training programs. This 
will help our current members and our future members to have 
the advanced technology to be able to work on these electric 
zero-emission buses. It is a win-win for everybody.
    In conclusion, through the IIJA Congress has recognized 
that if we want to create the solid union jobs and attract 
people to the transit industry we must also invest in the 
people that make transit a critical part of the Nation's 
economy. Changes come, and it is hard for some people, but ATU 
stands ready to work with the Biden administration and this 
Committee to make sure that the IIJA gets carried out 
successfully.
    Thank you for this bill and the opportunity to testify.
    Chairman Brown. Mr. McMillan, thank you for your comments.
    I will start, Ms. Birdsong Terry. What will new bus rapid 
transit service on West 25th Street do for the neighborhoods 
along the route, and how is RTA supporting economic development 
in other neighborhoods around Cleveland, like Slavic Village? 
My wife and I live about a mile from Slavic Village. So talk 
about that if you would.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. Sure. I would be happy to. Thank you, 
Chairman Brown.
    It is amazing the amount of infrastructure that can happen 
and then the effects that it can provide on a positive note for 
the residents of Greater Cleveland. We currently have a BRT in 
place that has been around for approximately 15 years, so BRT 
is not new to Cleveland, as you know. However, being able to 
duplicate that through new projects and with the help of the 
IIJA is just something that we are really excited about, to be 
quite honest.
    There are two particular projects that I want to highlight 
in response to your question, Chairman. The West 25th Corridor 
priority project that we have, it is a BRT project in 
collaboration on the campus of MetroHealth. MetroHealth is a 
medical facility that really serves as a Level 1 trauma center 
as well for those type of incidents that we discussed earlier, 
and it also kind of goes right through the middle of a Latino 
community along West 25th, that really provides an opportunity 
for accessibility when RTA has service there. Making sure that 
we can provide opportunity for economics, work, health, for 
those residents of that area is tremendous.
    We also have opportunity, as you mentioned, through Slavic 
Village, to be able to serve that corridor, and these are 
lower-income areas that are on the cusp of kind of 
gentrification in a positive way. Being able to do that really 
serves the ability to become an economic driver in Cleveland.
    We are looking at design work for the MetroHealth and with 
the Slavic Village area, that particular award we had a 
$432,000 grant from the same TOD pilot grant program as before, 
and the goals are very similar between the two projects. We 
expect to be able to put those into effect within the next 
coming years.
    Again, this is just a really great opportunity to show that 
we have an economic prowess in public transportation and we are 
not just simply moving people. We are actually connecting them 
to opportunities that allow them to be able to contribute to 
the economic vitality of the region.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you. I would only amend your comments 
that MetroHealth is a public hospital----
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. Yes.
    Chairman Brown. ----equal in quality to more renowned 
hospitals, the University Hospital and Cleveland Clinic. So 
thank you for mentioning them.
    I am happy our Committee could authorize funding for 
railcar replacement, but let me back up a second and ask you 
about that. Tell the Committee more about the current state of 
RTA's railcar fleet. You said they are 38- to 42-years old, 
something like that, four-decades old. Talk for a moment about 
what that means and what replacement will do.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. Thank you, Chairman. I would be happy 
to. You are correct. Our railcars--and we have approximately 76 
of them--date back approximately 40 years. They vary in range 
between 38 and 41 years of age. As I mentioned previously, that 
is well beyond their useful life, and as you well know, we are 
in the throes of being able to make sure that we can solidify 
funding to replace all of our railcars for heavy and light 
rail.
    We are actually looking at what I would call a flex car, to 
be able to take advantage of training so that we can actually 
train up our mechanical staff to make sure that they are at the 
cutting edge of technology.
    We are in the middle stages of negotiation for a car 
builder, and with any luck we will be able to announce that 
publicly this spring.
    We currently are looking at a $393 million price tag to 
replace all of those railcars, so we know that transportation 
is not cheap by any means. However, it does serve for multiple 
generations, and that is what we are looking forward to.
    Just to give you a quick example of the inflation that we 
have to deal with, just last year we were looking at a price 
tag of $300 million, and so that has definitely increased over 
time. So the longer we wait the more expensive it will be. And 
also with a lot of the rail incidents that have happened within 
recent times that is a byproduct of waiting too long.
    And so we want to make sure that in Greater Cleveland we 
are able to take advantage of being proactive, and we have a 
task team that we have put together for quite some time, and we 
actually put $10 million aside out of our own budget annually 
to make sure that we can bridge that gap. We have currently 
identified $213 million toward that, and our residents are 
really excited to be able to feel safer on our system. We do 
everything that we can to make sure that we are providing that 
type of service, but to be quite honest with you, we hold in 
more trains than we would like because we have to make sure 
that they are safe before we put them out.
    So our ideal situation is a 60-car fleet to be able to be 
in service and serving our residents within the next 3 years.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you. And I would point out--and thank 
you for what you are doing on investment--I would point out 
this Committee, before I was Chair, was just referred to as the 
Senate Banking Committee because it was way too much about Wall 
Street. Now the focus in this Committee is housing, and the 
focus in this Committee is public transit, and that is why the 
investment, and I am hopeful we do even more. So thank you.
    Mr. McMillan, let me shift to you. I know I am over a bit, 
and Ranking Member Scott can do the same thing.
    Senator Scott. Please take your time, sir.
    Chairman Brown. OK. Thank you, Senator Scott.
    Thanks for alerting the Committee about transit agencies, 
some of their failure to establish their safety committees. We 
need these committees to function effectively. What more can 
FTA do to ensure safety committees are functioning, and as you 
answer the question, tell us what worked well at the MTA in 
Baltimore as the safety committee was founded, and especially 
your experience as a driver for more or less close to two 
decades, what new designs for operator compartments make them 
safer for pedestrians and riders and operators? So bring your 
personal experience into this answer, if you would.
    Mr. McMillan. OK, yeah. So first of all, it was the ATU who 
first brought it to the FTA's attention that a lot of agencies 
that were covered by the unions were not in compliance with the 
IIJA provision. Once they were alerted about it then it was 
told by the FTA National President, John Costa, that they will 
continue to have the ATU to give them the updates of who is out 
of compliance. If the FTA could take on that responsibility to 
be able to ensure that there is a reporting agency within the 
transportation industries to report back to the FTA about where 
they are with the IIJA Joint Safety Committee, that will be a 
great help on their part.
    Also too, in Baltimore--and once again I have to give 
accolades to Senator Chris Van Hollen because what he did not 
only was authoring the bill, he continued to have steady 
communications with the labor leaders and Maryland to ask them, 
``How is it going?'' ``Where are you at?'' and just kept input 
on it. Our ATU national president has also had the leadership 
from the unions to report back to him so that he could report 
to the FTA as to where we are.
    So when I was able to go back to the table--and I am also a 
member of the committee, our Joint Safety Committee, so as soon 
as I tell the administrator of MTA that, ``Oh, I just had an 
update with Senator Chris Van Hollen to give him this,'' they 
want to make sure that they were in compliance because they did 
not want to have a bad report.
    Also too, when you are constantly, when we were reminding 
them of what could be enforced, there is a provision in the 
IIJA to say that funding should be withheld. Those penalties 
need to be enforced for those who are not in compliance. And I 
think if the FTA would enforce these recommendations it would 
help better with informing and getting these committees 
started.
    From the operator standpoint, being a frontline employee, 
it is great to hear from the frontline employees. They know 
what is out there every day. It is not just done by paperwork 
or analysis that comes in through data from just somebody who 
rides the bus just 1 day. The commonly occurring assaults, also 
the bus designs.
    Our ATU has also created what they call a study on a future 
bus. This has to do with the A-frames on the bus, where there 
is bad vision sight, also with the mirrors that are put on 
buses so it will give better pedestrian protection for those 
who are crossing the street who may be caught in a blind spot.
    Also, when the pandemic came along, you had the filtration 
system. If a person was to cough and the particles get in the 
air, it would get into the ventilation system. That ventilation 
system came straight up to the bus operator's compartment. 
There have been filtration systems that have been recommended 
on the ATU's behalf to use. Also a closed-off compartment when 
it comes to protecting the operator from not only diseases but 
also from assaults. A completely closed-off compartment as if 
you were in the cockpit of an airplane.
    We also have situations that protect pedestrians. Some of 
the suggestions that we have given to the Administration was if 
a
person can see themselves getting on a bus and they see their 
face through a camera, it is more likely that they will think 
twice before they commit an assault on the operator or harm 
their fellow passengers on a bus, because they know that they 
can be identified.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Mr. McMillan. Senator Scott.
    Senator Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am going to 
reserve my 4 minutes and 51 seconds for the next hearing when 
we have Secretary Yellen here, so I can have more time with 
her, sir.
    Chairman Brown. The statute of limitations, Senator Scott.
    Senator Scott. I know the statute of limitations. Hopefully 
it lasts at least 2 or 3 weeks.
    Chairman Brown. Listen, I learned that from a Yale Law 
School graduate who went to school with my daughter.
    Senator Scott. Well, I am so happy that you Ivy League 
folks can tell time, but I will say, I will take my 4 minutes 
and 51 seconds for the next hearing when we have Secretary 
Yellen. Good point, sir. None of that counts against my time. 
Thank you very much, sir.
    Chairman Brown. Did they turn the clock on yet?
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Scott. May the Lord bless me indeed.
    Mr. McMillan, you said a lot about improving public safety 
as it relates to cameras and other ways to reduce crime, reduce 
violence, by doing simple things that are happening frankly 
everywhere. Cameras can be a strong deterrent. One of the 
reasons why I have been encouraging and supporting body-worn 
cameras for our offices is I think that everyone goes home more 
safely when you have just a simple body-worn camera. And so 
from my perspective cameras in mass transit just seems like 
common sense to me. Your descriptions of the violence facing 
your colleagues every day in your testimony is certainly 
stirring.
    Would you say that your drivers would feel safer with more 
of the technology that you talked about, safer with more 
equipment around them? And what about the riders as well? Talk 
to me about that for about a minute, because I am going to have 
to move on to the next person.
    Mr. McMillan. Yes. With those added protections our drivers 
would feel safer with the cameras but also monitors to where 
that person could see themselves actually getting on a bus. The 
operator compartment, that is their work station.
    Senator Scott. Yes.
    Mr. McMillan. I was a bus operator and a train operator. I 
felt safer as a train operator because I was completely closed 
in. I had a locked door and it was less dealing with public 
interaction when they get on disgruntled because of the fare 
structure or whether it is because of being late for work 
because of the bus schedules or not being on time.
    So yes, they would definitely feel safer. And also patrons, 
if they can actually know that, hey, the bus driver is not just 
paying attention to the road but I see a camera that sees 
everyone else on this bus, too, and can see what is going on, 
they will feel like they are being more protected as well.
    Senator Scott. Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Keel, thank you once again for being here with us this 
morning and thank you for your work that you do for Greenville 
and for the entire State of South Carolina, which is why I 
think it is important to understand how your agency has 
navigated the challenges facing transit agencies.
    It is my understanding that while many transit agencies 
were rolling back services during the pandemic your agency was 
doing the opposite and expanding services. Is that right?
    Mr. Keel. That is correct.
    Senator Scott. Can you walk us through how your agency has 
navigated the pandemic and an expansion in the middle of one?
    Mr. Keel. I can. So I will say throughout the pandemic I do 
not think South Carolina ever shut down but we did slow down, 
and we certainly saw that. But the majority of our riders are 
essential workers, meaning that they did not have the ability 
to work from home, and because of that they had to get to work 
every day, whether it was going to the hospital or going to a 
restaurant to work or going to a manufacturing facility. You 
know, we had to keep moving. And throughout that process, you 
know, being small does have some advantages, and one of those 
is being able to inherently know our people and what they need.
    And our planning process really began back in 2017 and 
2018, had been prepared to scale up, and as a result of the 
pandemic and ridership not decreasing the way the national 
average was, it was a risk of let us move forward and add more 
service and make sure people can access that shift work and can 
ultimately stay on the bus.
    And throughout that process we adapted as quickly as we 
could. You know, all of the COVID protocols that practically 
every other agency went through we took advantage of to keep 
our people healthy, to keep our riders healthy, and ultimately 
in the end, it has certainly paid off and our ridership has 
grown because of it.
    Senator Scott. Two more quick questions for you, and with 
the Chairman's absence I am not using any of my time that I 
have reserved for the next Committee hearing.
    I know you have some traditional diesel-powered buses and 
some battery electric buses in your fleet and are looking at 
compressed natural gas buses for the future. As you are 
acquiring new vehicles, what goes into your decisionmaking 
process when deciding what kind of bus you need? Up front 
capital costs? Maintenance costs over the life of your bus? 
What else?
    Mr. Keel. So those are obviously two big ones. We obviously 
care a lot about the environment and want to make sure that we 
are making green and conscious decisions around that.
    Senator Scott. Yes.
    Mr. Keel. That being said, we are also very aware of the 
weather in South Carolina. Hurricanes are a force to be 
reckoned with. We are also near Oconee nuclear facility. We are 
aware of their disaster response plans and how we may have to 
play a role in that one day. God forbid that ever happened.
    But having the ability to have a vehicle that we can fuel 
up and it is going to run for, you know, 18 or 20 hours is 
important. Battery electric vehicles really do not afford you 
that opportunity right now. They are taking 5, you know, 
sometimes less, sometimes more hours to charge.
    So there is a place for battery electric technology. You 
know, our board is certainly committed to going away from 
diesel, and that really is where the compressed natural gas 
comes in. I do not think it is the end all, be all. I think 
that our future opportunities would be technology and even with 
hydrogen technology that are going to be better and cleaner. So 
it is definitely going to be a staggered approach as we 
transition away from traditional hydrocarbons.
    Senator Scott. Thank you. Just extending myself 30 seconds, 
I would say that one of the best decisions I made when I became 
a Senator was to go undercover and ride through mass 
transportation systems in my State, and specifically in the 
Charleston area. It gave me an opportunity, as a new member of 
this body, to appreciate the challenges, the opportunities, the 
wait. So many folks wait 30 minutes to 90 minutes to get to a 
job for 7 hours, and have the same wait on the back end. And 
having a chance to talk to passengers real time about what they 
are doing and why they are doing it, whether it is just going 
to babysit grandkids or trying to get to work or go to school, 
one of the best experiences I would encourage all of us to do 
in public service is make sure that we take the time to 
appreciate the experience that we spend so much time talking 
about. I think that is something that we all benefit from, and 
we make better decisions. Thank you.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you. It is hard to imagine that you 
went undercover, you are so well known.
    Senator Scott. Yes, sir. I better not eat up all your time.
    Senator Menendez. Well thank you all for joining us. My 
colleagues here have heard me talk various times about the 
Gateway Program. Gateway aims to modernize the rail 
infrastructure connecting New Jersey to New York Penn Station. 
It is a critical stretch of track that carries over 200,000 
daily Amtrak and New Jersey Transit passenger trips on 
approximately 450 trains. It is a linchpin of the entire 
Northeast Corridor going from Boston to Washington, a region 
that accounts for 20 percent of our national gross domestic 
product. So I am pleased to see the Biden administration 
included $700 for the Hudson River tunnels and the President's 
fiscal year 2024 budget request. I am hopeful that the project 
can move into the engineering phase of the Capital Investments 
Grants Program in the very near future.
    I raise this because I often talk about Gateway and the 
projects of this scale as having a national significance 
because they do. But they also have major impacts on the ground 
in providing safe, reliable, and accessible service to 
communities.
    Mr. McMillan, first of all my thoughts and prayers are with 
your member who got stabbed yesterday, and just highlights some 
of the discussion you were having before that this is a job 
that is critically important to move people but it also can be 
risky. So we are in solidarity with you there.
    Can you speak for a moment about what these types of major 
infrastructure projects and the Federal investment that comes 
with them means to your members on the ground?
    Mr. McMillan. Yes. Well, for our members it is--the funding 
that can come in, I do not have to, as the president, negotiate 
a contract, continue to have to go to them and tell them that, 
hey, the reason why the company is saying that your safety is 
not as important is because they cannot afford it. You know, we 
are tired of hearing that they have to cut service. When you 
cut service it impacts the public. If you get an angry 
passenger that gets on a bus, the first person that they see 
that they want to take it out on is the bus operator.
    So if this funding can come in so that these services do 
not have to be cut, procurement, when you are waiting on parts 
for buses to be fixed so you do not have as many buses on the 
street, which also causes service cuts. The first person, 
again, that they see when a bus is late, they take it out on 
the bus operator. So our members will not have to have that 
interaction with the riding public and get into these 
altercations. So it would be safer for them, and also for those 
who are riding, they will get to these good-paying jobs, and 
they will also be able to get there on time and keep their 
jobs.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you. Now I have been an advocate of 
transit-oriented development because I have seen the 
transformative effects it can have on communities, stretching 
back to the time that I was a mayor. When properly planned and 
executed, transit-oriented development can bring significant 
new investment to communities, providing new economic 
opportunities for families and business owners while ensuring 
affordable housing for residents and encouraging the use of 
public transit. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
expanded a TOD pilot program that I helped create several years 
ago.
    So Ms. Birdsong Terry, I understand that the Greater 
Cleveland Regional Transit Authority has received two of these 
grants in the past, one as recently as last November. Can you 
discuss how these investments have made communities a much more 
vibrant place to live?
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. Absolutely. Thank you very much. I 
appreciate the question.
    To your point, those TOD projects are imperative, 
especially in cities that have an urban core as well as a rural 
impact. If I can give a quick statistic, I actually asked our 
deputy general manager of H.R. to pull a couple of records 
before I came here, to find out just what the impact was for 
those folks that live in Cuyahoga County and then those outside 
of it.
    We have roughly about 2,100 employees, and 600 of those 
live outside of Cuyahoga County. And I mention that because 
those men and women are part of the force that create those TOD 
projects. So we are actually investing in the generational 
wealth of the State well beyond the urban core.
    When you get into those kinds of projects, such as the West 
25th BRT program and the Slavic Village, those are just a 
couple of programs. We have the 79th Street Opportunity 
Corridor support where there is $1 billion that have been 
poured into that particular investment area. These are a lot of 
what would be traditionally called ``blighted area'' by urban 
planners. I am an urban planner by trade and then got into 
transportation and have worked every shift that probably is 
known to man. So understanding how this creates opportunities, 
especially for the youth, is really important.
    Cleveland has a literacy rate that probably is around 60 
percent as far as those individuals that need to be able to 
understand the importance of an education, and being able to 
have access to that is vital.
    I would also mention the paratransit community that we 
serve is really important as well. Our board chair, Reverend 
Charles Lucas, is actually a paraplegic and has been that way 
for about 18 years, and he depends on our service to take him 
in and around the city, and is quite, frankly, probably one of 
the most active board chairs I have ever experienced, and being 
able to provide that is essential.
    Senator Menendez. So economic opportunity is something that 
really is part of the equation of these transit-oriented 
developments.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. Absolutely.
    Senator Menendez. I will submit a question to the record on 
flexibility on operating funds and how it would affect you.
    And the Chairman has asked me to recognize Senator Vance.
    Senator Scott. Actually, sir, Senator Tillis is next.
    Senator Menendez [presiding]. OK. Then Senator Tillis.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you. Sorry, J.D. Thank you all for 
being here. Mr. Keel, it is great to see you from our great 
State.
    Real quick question for you has to do with the Section 
5307, Urbanized Area Formula Funding grant funds. Can you 
explain a little bit how those funds have been deployed and 
what, if anything, we should do in terms of constraints and 
flexibility that need to be considered by Congress?
    Mr. Keel. I will do my best. So 5307 funding for GTA is 
lifeblood. If that was to disappear our agency would no longer 
be serving anybody in Greenville, and I am fairly confident 
that that would be true for the majority of South Carolina.
    We are a small agency with 12 routes so we qualify under 
the 100-bus rule, so we use a lot of that funding, up to 75 
percent of it actually, for operating assistance, meaning it is 
helping paying bus operator salaries and paying for fuel and 
other portion issues for preventative maintenance. So 
ultimately it is exceptionally important to us.
    I think kind of one of the original purposes of that 
funding was to be heavily capital focused on buying equipment, 
replacing equipment, but as to the nature of really the economy 
for the past several decades, you know, opportunities were 
there in smaller agencies and smaller systems to use it for 
operating assistance. And now that it has been, it is becoming 
incredibly important to our system.
    Senator Tillis. I think any feedback, and to either Ms. 
India, maybe, your feedback specifically on it. I understand we 
may be able to, aside from giving certainty on the funding 
stream, but that there may be some things that we need to 
rethink with respect to constraints. Anything to add to that?
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. The flexibility--thank you for the 
question--between capital and operating is definitely, I would 
say, important, if not essential, to Greater Cleveland, 
particularly in light of that we cannot predict the sales tax 
and how that impacts our budget. For example, 2008, when we had 
quite a bit of financial volatility within the country, 
especially in the areas of real estate, the sales tax took a 
dip, and if we were to get into that situation again we would 
be in very dire straits as far as being able to make good on 
the strategic plan that we have for a lot of our capital 
projects. And being able to kind of flex that funding back and 
forth allows us to stay above water and also make good on those 
technology improvements that lead to the safety of those 
members that the union has. And Cleveland, I would say, is 
about 85 percent unionized as far as GCRTA is concerned, so we 
definitely are support.
    Senator Tillis. Mr. Keel, South Carolina is a pretty red 
State. To what extent is the legislature being helpful to your 
priorities in Greenville?
    Mr. Keel. So I have been in South Carolina for 7 years, and 
I will say there has been a bigger interest in workforce 
transportation as it relates to public transit probably in the 
past 6 months than it has been in my time before that, and it 
really is being driven by industry and manufacturers in our 
State who have begun asking or demanding more public transit to 
get their workers to work and be able to use that after hours 
to be able to move around, where they do not have to rely on a 
car. At the rate South Carolina is growing, congestion is 
becoming an issue, and they are aware of them getting to work 
on time is becoming increasingly important. And that really is 
what has been driving more conversation as it relates to 
transit in South Carolina over the past couple of years.
    Senator Tillis. And this is just a broader question. I do 
not want to go over time after I jumped in front of Senator 
Vance. But I was Speaker of the House down in North Carolina. I 
spent a lot of time on mass transit in general, including light 
rail, and was generally supportive, but that was 12 years ago 
when I started, and the world has kind of changed a little bit.
    So how are you all looking ahead with respect to new 
technologies with respect to the employment patterns, 
transportation patterns that changed dramatically during COVID. 
Some of that is sticky. So what could you tell me about 
priorities that you may have had 5 years ago that are making 
you rethink exactly what role transit is going to play in a 
vastly different futurescape, as far as I am concerned? And we 
will start with Mr. Keel and then Ms. Birdsong Terry, and then 
Mr. McMillan. Also I want to offer my condolences on the event 
with the bus driver as well. Sorry to hear about that.
    But Mr. Keel, if we could start with you. I want to get a 
sense that we are really rethinking things and not implementing 
plans that may be 10-years old in this space.
    Mr. Keel. So we update our plans about every 3 years, so we 
basically break it down and rethink it about every 3 to 5 
years. And what we really see is that we actually saw an 
increase in opportunity as it relates to manufacturing jobs. 
The majority of our customers are not commuters, so we did not 
see the dip that some systems saw.
    And we do look at that, and we look at who our workforce is 
and at the same time who our employers are, to make sure that 
we are having good conservations and good public involvement, 
to make sure that as we are thinking about the future that we 
understand what those travel patterns will look like. In 
addition to changing technologies we are looking at fare 
payment type and at the same time what is the future of bus 
transportation as it relates to what propulsion would look like 
as well.
    Senator Tillis. Ms. Birdsong Terry.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. Thank you very much. I appreciate it, 
Senator. You are absolutely correct. We have to maintain 
flexibility in order to be able to be competitive in the 
market.
    So some of the things that we are doing at GCRTA include 
our strategic plan was adopted within the pandemic timeframe, 
and that is a 10-year plan but we also have a simultaneous 
short-range plan. I am, again, a planner by trade so I am very 
well aware that they can belong on the shelf and accumulate 
dust and nothing ever happens. So in order to make sure that 
does not occur in Cleveland we have got a short-term plan over 
the next 1 to 3 years that basically takes us through task 
items.
    And we have what is called a Net Promoter Score, if you are 
familiar with that through the private industry. Some look like 
a Yelp review, how you are perceived by your peers and by your 
customers. We actually look at that on a quarterly basis, 
monthly at a tactical level, to find out what the customer 
experience is like, as well as the operational experience, and 
we have our goals set by that, in order to align with the 
strategic plan. And that is the plans that include the 
compressed natural gas instead of diesel, the technology, and 
so on and so forth, as well as workforce.
    We also have completed what we called a Next Gen, and that 
is a revamp of our system. We have done that through the 
pandemic as well. We actually took an additional 6 months in 
order to recalibrate because we have a lot of that reverse 
commute pattern going on. People are going out into our suburbs 
for workforce opportunities instead of the urban core. People 
are also working from home so we have to be cognizant of that.
    Our ridership is probably about 65 to 70 percent on a good 
day, and that is 65 to 70 percent of pre-pandemic ridership. So 
what we have also done is rolled out a couple of microtransit 
programs, which we are super excited about. That was probably 
one of the first things I heard 3 \1/2\ years ago when I 
stepped on Cleveland soil, and that was coming from those 
suburbs, Solon and those others, for example, that are about 30 
minutes outside of the urban core. We are actually working with 
the union partnership to make sure that we operate almost like 
a private business in the beginning, at the pilot program, and 
it is essentially a match program where those industries that 
need those workers are actually putting their money where their 
mouth is. We are matching that, to the tune of $600,000, to 
make sure we can have the 18-month pilot program and get those 
people to work so they do not have to have that 2 \1/2\ or \1/
2\ hour commute time on top of a 10-hour work day.
    So those are some of the things we are doing. We also are 
starting to look at fare capping, which actually gets into the 
equity part of how to make sure that accessibility is really, 
truly equitable in Cleveland. Those are just a few things that 
we are doing to make sure we can stay on top of things.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you all. Mr. McMillan, I am way over 
time now so I defer back to the Chair.
    Senator Menendez. Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank all of 
you for your testimony and for the work that you do. Mr. 
McMillan, good to see you again. And I was sorry to learn that 
you were at the hospital last night, visiting a fellow transit 
worker, an operator in the MTA that was stabbed. Is that right?
    Mr. McMillan. Yes.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, please give him our prayers, and 
his family.
    Mr. McMillan. Thank you, sir.
    Senator Van Hollen. And that does bring me to the issues 
that I wanted to raise because it was great to work with you 
and others in the transit community to introduce the Transit 
Worker and Pedestrian Act to protect transit worker safety. And 
I was really pleased that we were successful at including a lot 
of those provision in the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
modernization legislation.
    I want to talk a little bit about implementation of those 
safety provisions because I understand that so far you have had 
a good experience in Baltimore working with the transit folks 
to implement that. Is that right?
    Mr. McMillan. Yes, we do.
    Senator Van Hollen. But I also understand that it is more 
of a mixed bag in other parts of the country. And I do want to 
just make clear to all the transit agencies around the country 
that putting these safety plans in place is not voluntary. It 
is an obligation, because of the kind of dangers that we just 
discussed, that transit workers face.
    Can you talk about the experience elsewhere in the country 
and what challenges you are facing with some local agencies?
    Mr. McMillan. Yes. Some of the challenges we are facing 
right now is they feel like the law does not apply to them. And 
even though there are strict guidelines in there that point to 
if they do this they are still just being noncompliant. They 
also still want to say, ``Hey, this is my business. I make the 
rules.'' So those are the pushbacks that are coming and that we 
have to fight off.
    And on the public sector, you know, we are dealing with the 
private and public sector, and in the public sector in 
Maryland, once again having a Senator, you know, who was 
actually the author of the bill was a great help. Our ATU 
international president also was able to converse with the 
Committee here and also be able to better interpret the 
language, and he passed it on to us and we were able to also 
pass it on to the Administration that worked with us in those 
efforts.
    But across the Nation we are still having those problems, 
and those are the points that I brought up earlier that we are 
facing with the challenges.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, I appreciate that, and I 
understand from your testimony that right now FTA is relying on 
you, the ATU, to make determinations as to whether local 
transit agencies are in compliance. That should be the job of 
the FTA, right, with advice from you or input from you, but 
that should be something that they are responsible for, right?
    Mr. McMillan. Yes. That should be something that the FTA is 
responsible for.
    Senator Van Hollen. Yeah. Well, we are going to push them 
because the uneven implementation of this around the country is 
concerning, especially in light of the ongoing risks to transit 
workers.
    I just want to make a mention of the Red Line in Baltimore. 
As we all know, this was a big priority of the Maryland 
delegation for a long time. Our previous Governor pulled the 
plug on it, but we are working here, Senator Cardin and myself, 
members of the House, with the new Governor, Governor Moore, to 
implement that.
    What is your assessment of the impact that would have on 
Baltimore City in terms of the economy, and what impact would 
it have on transit workers?
    Mr. McMillan. Oh, this would have a tremendous impact, 
especially in Baltimore, and in Maryland, where we are right 
there on the East Coast. The Governor just announced that he 
wants all the vehicles in Maryland in the next 20 years to be 
electric. We also know that in Maryland the jobs that would be 
created for offshore wind dealing with going green, these will 
be labor jobs, jobs to where it should not just be constricted 
to where those who live in the eastern part of Baltimore are 
able to get to these jobs, but that west-to-east corridor with 
the Red Line. It will be able to let the companies know that we 
have employees who are outside the living area will be able to 
get there and make that connection in a timely fashion, and be 
able to get to all those jobs that will be created in a place 
called like Tradepoint Atlantic, who will have a lot to do with 
the electrification, offshore wind, and other areas with 
building that company back in Maryland.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, I appreciate that, and we 
introduced work together on the National Transit Workforce Act 
as well, and I was pleased to see the FTA stand up the training 
center. But we need to make sure we provide it with the 
resources needed. I mean, is workforce training, as we move 
toward more electrification in the cars going to be important?
    Mr. McMillan. It definitely will, not only in the cars but 
in the buses as well. The public will feel safer knowing that 
the MTA has skilled workers who have been trained right there 
on the property, on the vehicles that the operators are 
actually driving, to know that they are safe when they put them 
out there. We will not have to be sending the workers off to 
California, to come back and then do training. This funding 
could allow for us to have onsite training facilities on the 
property for these electric buses.
    Also, what is incorporated in these bills is to make sure 
that those workers who are there who are diesel workers, they 
will not be left behind. They will be also able to get the 
skill set and the training that is needed to our members to be 
able to work on these buses, efficiently and effectively.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you, 
Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Scott [presiding]. Senator Vance.
    Senator Vance. Thank you, Senator Scott, and Mr. McMillan, 
let me start by adding my voice to the condolences for what 
happened to your driver. We are certainly thinking about him 
and praying for him and hope everything turns out OK.
    I also just want to say that, you know, I have known a few 
bus drivers in my life and I know that public transit can 
sometimes be a thankless job. But I will say that as the father 
of a 5-year-old, a 3-year-old, and a 1-year-old, the 5- and the 
3-year-old are both boys, that outside of firefighters, bus 
drivers are maybe the coolest profession in the world to my two 
kids, or at least to the two boys. So know that there is an 
army of children who love what you guys do and appreciate it, 
and certainly all of us on this Committee do as well.
    I want to thank, in particular, Ms. Birdsong Terry. Thank 
you for your service to the State of Ohio. I appreciate you 
being here and hope you are enjoying Washington. And, you know, 
I just wanted to start maybe by asking a couple of questions 
about public safety in our transit system in Greater Cleveland.
    First, maybe just a very basic question. We obviously have 
quite a bad fentanyl problem in Ohio. Certainly Cleveland has 
been no exception. Have your drivers been seeing that? Have 
they been affected by it? Are they responding to it? And what 
do you think we could do better to better prepare them and 
better equip them to deal with it?
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. Thank you very much for the question, 
and I also am in the fight with you for toddlers. I have a 1- 
and a 2-year-old, a boy and girl.
    Senator Vance. God bless you.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. You as well.
    To answer your question, and to really kind of segue into 
that, it is really important to be able to prepare, I think, 
the next generation for accessibility and making sure that we 
have a safe environment is absolutely important. So I take 
personal offense when things like what was mentioned happened 
last night.
    Senator Vance. Sure.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. We are doing a lot of things in 
Cleveland that I think could be replicated through the Nation. 
We are particularly working with the ATU on our side to make 
sure that our union employees feel that they have a voice and 
that they have somewhere to discuss.
    We also have an FOP, a Fraternal Order of Police, as we do 
have a Transit Police Force. We are slated for about 100 
officers. We are currently down 23 positions, which is a 
testament to the workforce issue, and also a canine unit. Not 
every agency, I realize, has that asset, but with that I think 
there are a lot of things that can happen in order to kind of 
combat some of the volatility.
    Fare evasion is a big issue in every community, but making 
sure that we have that support by our legislation to make sure 
that we can actually process those issue are important.
    We actually have started a Civilian Oversight Committee, 
and we have done this in a space of positivity and proactivity. 
And that is really important too because a lot of these things 
happen after you have a tragedy. But making sure you have that 
transparency and additional oversight to be able to utilize the 
bodycams we just put in is really important. I would also say a 
Transit Ambassador Program is something that can really be 
helpful.
    So that funding for workforce that we are asking for, for 
the State budget and also through IIJA for flex funds, is 
really important because we have to make sure that those 
individuals have an outlet, to make sure that when you have 
that mental health issue occur on your vehicle, which I was 
discussing with Mr. McMillan earlier, we, I believe, both agree 
that that is the crux of where that stems from. And you see 
that exacerbated in urban areas like Baltimore and Cleveland.
    You want to make sure that we have a resource available. We 
have got our program up and running. We have 16 professionals 
on that team, and 6 of them are social workers. So they have 
got the experience, they have got the de-escalation training to 
be able to refer those individuals to housing programs, 
economic programs, and mental health.
    But those are just some of the things that we can do.
    Senator Vance. Sure. So let me just ask you one final 
question just about the expanded notion of public safety. And 
there is not a right answer here. I am just curious how you 
think about this as you lead this organization.
    Let me just explain briefly why I ask. I come from a 
reasonably poor family, and one of the things that I take away 
from that experience is I think kids, you know, they know what 
they see, and what becomes normal to them is what they start to 
expect for themselves. So if they see Mom and Dad go to work, 
if they see Mom and Dad have a loving relationship, that 
becomes normal to them. But if they are riding the bus and they 
see people using drugs or people being violent with one 
another, that becomes normal too, and that is obviously a bad 
thing.
    I am curious how you think obviously we are focused, when 
we talk about public safety for the drivers and the riders on 
violence, first of all, and want to make sure that it is safe 
in a very physical, obvious sense. But how are you guys 
thinking about what is happening on the buses? I have certainly 
heard reports in various communities that increasing rates of 
drug use on the buses. How do you guys think about that when 
you realize that a lot of the people you are serving are kids, 
and we do not want them to get the sense of that is the way the 
world is.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. Sure. I appreciate the question. Thank 
you. I think a lot of it actually starts with marketing, and I 
know that is a softer side of how to approach some of this. But 
the unfortunate part is that these are the anomalies that 
happen. They should be the rule. And I think for everything bad 
that happens, we have a lot of good that occurs as well.
    And so we have taken a really intuitive and I think 
intentional step in Cleveland, to be able to make folks 
understand that we are a safe option for mobility, whether you 
are talking about through COVID or whether you are talking 
about the violence. We actually are starting to actually revamp 
our advertising guidelines and work through our advertising 
partners to make it more of a positive messaging that gets out 
of there, to be able to have crisis communication programs for 
all of our staff really, and also work with the media to be 
able to highlight some of the great things that we are doing. 
It offsets some of those one-off situations that really are 
horrible, so that people do not think that that is the only 
thing we do.
    And then also with the kids we have Kid Watch programs, 
where we have IDs available for kids at major event. We have 
our Transit Police going on there so they understand that there 
is someone to talk to if something happens. We also have human 
trafficking programs, where we work with a lot of our sister 
agencies and social safety net. And we have caught more than I 
want to admit situations where we are intervening in a good 
way, and we are stopping that bad situation from happening.
    Might I also say that it is important to have that radio 
connection. I have an operations background as well, and being 
able to communicate with a force bigger than your own is 
important. So being able to share radio channels with your city 
police is absolutely imperative so you can increase your on-
time performance when it comes to getting there when something 
is happening.
    Senator Vance. Thank you all.
    Senator Warren [presiding]. Thank you, and in the absence 
of the Chair I am going to be the Chair, and I am going to 
recognize myself, so I can ask some questions.
    I am very glad that we are talking about transit today. I 
want to talk about bridges because bridges are a key part of 
transit and our broader transportation system. However, 
according to the Federal Highway Administration nearly 69,000 
highway bridges--that is more than 1 out of every 10 highway 
bridges in the whole country--are currently classified as 
``structurally deficient.'' In Massachusetts, the Cape Cod 
bridges have needed repair for years and years and years. These 
bridges, which were built in 1935, are the only link between 
Cape Cod and the Mainland. There is no drive-around here. They 
are the only link, and more than 35 million vehicles cross them 
each year. They serve as the central routes for general 
transportation, for tourism, and for evacuation in case of 
emergencies.
    The bridges are vital assets for the Cape Cod economy but 
they are in desperate need of replacement. While the average 
age of an American bridge across the country is 42-years old, 
the Cape Cod bridges are 90-years old.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry, as head of the Greater Cleveland 
Regional Transit Authority you presided over the shutdown of 
your Waterfront Light Rail Line beginning back in 2020, and as 
I understand it is still ongoing, due to safety concerns 
related to a bridge on the route, namely stress fractures and 
stability issues.
    I want to ask you just to say a word about what was the 
impact on Cleveland's citizens and the local economy of having 
to shut down transit routes because of bridge maintenance 
issues.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. Thank you for the question. You are 
absolutely correct. We have been working on our Waterfront Line 
bridge for quite some time now. We expect for it to open up 
later in the year. We have got about a year to go.
    That particular bridge was not as old as the ones you 
mentioned. However, it was built in 1996, and that being said 
is even more disconcerting because it is a younger bridge with 
particular safety issues that we found actually during an 
inspection, which allowed us to be able to get ahead of some of 
the catastrophe that could have occurred.
    Senator Warren. You shut it down.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. We did.
    Senator Warren. Tell me a little bit about the impact on 
the citizens of Cleveland.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. Absolutely. So that bridge serves as a 
connection to a lot of our entertainment districts, our 
Cleveland Browns, if you are a football fan, and also some of 
the science centers downtown as well as The Flats neighborhood, 
which has a huge economic driver for residential as well as 
entertainment. It was definitely an outcry from the community 
to say, ``Are you sure you have to do this?'' because it really 
kind of cuts away the mobility when we have major events. We 
have got to supplant some of that service with busing, and when 
you do that it is definitely a little slower, it does not have 
the same capacity, and it also is a stress on our operations.
    Senator Warren. OK. So waiting until you have to shut a 
bridge down is a serious problem----
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. Yes.
    Senator Warren.----for a city like Cleveland, and I am 
going to guess out on the Cape as well.
    You know, I know that the Cleveland Transit Authority 
received Federal funding to help improve the bridge 
infrastructure. Ms. Birdsong Terry, how important was that 
Federal investment to making your bridges safer and supporting 
your local economy?
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. So the passage of the IIJA was 
imperative for us, to be able to get that work done. We could 
not do a lot of the remediation on our own. We had to be able 
to bring external crews, so that was imperative. And then also 
it allowed us to be able to keep the rest of our projects on 
time so that we did not have to kind of trade one project for 
another. And we also were able to use some of our 30 percent 
formula funding to be able to contribute to that project.
    Senator Warren. Right. And let me just ask one last 
question here. Was this investment something that Cleveland 
could have done on its own, using State and local funds?
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. No, we could not have.
    Senator Warren. OK. That is the key point here. We need 
Federal funds.
    You know, the Biden administration has made historic 
investments in our infrastructure, including through the 
Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act. The Cape Cod bridges 
have yet to receive funding from the infrastructure bill, in 
part because the previous Governor of Massachusetts failed to 
prioritize this issue and put together a competitive 
application.
    But I am not going to stop fighting for Federal funds for 
these critical assets, and that is why I am glad that in 
President Biden's budget, which was released last week, there 
is a significant $350 million down payment toward a $600 
million commitment to replace the Cape Cod bridges and protect 
both the local economy out on the Cape and public safety.
    Our bridges should not be weak links in our transportation 
systems, and I am committed to making sure that that happens, 
both in Massachusetts and all around the country.
    So thank you very much, and thank you for your work.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. Thank you.
    Senator Warren. And now, having taken over this gavel, I 
recognize Senator Britt.
    Senator Britt. Thank you very much, Senator Warren.
    I am going to start by leaning in to some of what we heard 
at the very beginning of this hearing, stating the fact that 
our banking system remains strong, that the banks in the great 
State of Alabama are strong. SVB is a clear case of regulators 
refusing to do their job, despite the fact that all the signs, 
all the red flags were there. The Fed failed to use the tools 
in their toolbox to prevent what we saw last week, and I want 
to know why. I want answers.
    There are people in Alabama who are simply struggling to 
make ends meet while SVB is getting a bailout from the Biden 
administration. Alabamians do not just want answers. They 
deserve answers, and I, for one, will not stop until we get 
them.
    I join the Ranking Member in calling for a hearing, and I 
am hopeful that the Chairman will do just that and will give us 
the opportunity to have the responsible parties sit right in 
front of us and allow us to do our job.
    When it comes to the topic of the day, I want to start with 
thanking each and every one of you for being here, and letting 
Mr. McMillan know that your driver, your operators, your entire 
transit family are in our thoughts and prayers. Thank you for 
your continued service and what you are doing each and every 
day to help make public transit the safest it can possibly be.
    Mr. Keel, I am going to start with you. When people think 
about public transit most imagine a big, busy, New York City, 
and a subway to go along with that. Public transit in Alabama 
is very different. We rely on buses, especially in our rural 
areas. People use these buses to get to work, to buy groceries, 
to see the doctor, or to head to church.
    Mr. Keel, I am a huge fan of Greenville, South Carolina, 
and I believe it has a lot of similarities with communities all 
across the great State of Alabama. Just as in Greenville, 
transit operations in Alabama are tailored to the needs of the 
individual community or area, and I, for one, am a believer 
that local leaders know best.
    So based on your experience, do you believe that local 
communities should be able to make decisions regarding the 
transit needs of their unique community?
    Mr. Keel. In one word, absolutely, and I think that we 
demonstrate that mostly because we have a very tight-knit 
community. We have a lot of feedback from our county, from our 
local city government, and even from our legislative delegation 
that appoints members onto our board of directors. And because 
of that, and because of the great staff that we have, 
ultimately there are a lot of decisions that we do have the 
ability to make locally around some of the regulation that is 
provided to us.
    Senator Britt. So based on those comments I imagine you 
would agree local transit authorities, civic leaders are best 
suited to decide what type of buses they need, whether it be 
diesel, compressed natural gas, electric-powered buses, because 
each and every community is different. I will say in Alabama we 
have a problem with lack of range, so from Demopolis, in our 
more rural area, when they come to the big city, in Montgomery, 
they cannot actually make that trip and get back without 
recharging. So it is frustrating that this Administration has 
been pushing local communities to conform to the Green New Deal 
agenda and transit to green energy and green transit.
    I do not have to tell you that there is also, in addition 
to things like lack of range, there is a cost component that is 
incredibly hard for some of our communities, particularly in 
our rural areas.
    So in your experience, is it realistic or cost-effective to 
force communities to have a one-size-fits-all policy when it 
comes to busing?
    Mr. Keel. I do not think so at all. I think that the 
capital costs alone are something that smaller communities 
struggle with. Finding local match requirements for grants can 
be exceptionally difficult. And all of this is with the 
assumption that the utility in the area has the power to be 
able to support the demand on the grid. We are blessed in South 
Carolina that we really do not see those issues, but some of 
our more rural areas certainly do. And there are, quite 
frankly, some other opportunities out there that, in the short 
term, are better as this leading-edge technology continues to 
develop.
    Senator Britt. And let us lean into that. I only have a few 
more seconds. But when it comes to natural disasters, 
unfortunately Alabama is no stranger to them, whether it is 
hurricanes or tornadoes, and in that same time period the need 
to be able to have a vehicle that can be used without charging 
is essential.
    Mr. Keel. I would definitely agree with that. You know, the 
biggest kind of challenge that we face with a lot of the 
battery electric technology is that it works good as long as 
all conditions are normal, meaning that you have good weather, 
whether or not you have had time to charge, you have had time 
to deploy. You know, in the event that you have a natural 
disaster that you need to be able to send a bus to or send it 
across the State to help evacuate the low country of South 
Carolina, we also would not be able to deploy that battery 
electric fleet to do that.
    So having the flexibility to have other fuel sources, 
whether it is compressed natural gas, or we wait a few years 
and we have hydrogen technology, is exceptionally important to 
be able to have that flexibility in our system.
    Senator Britt. Thank you so much, Mr. Keel. I am out of 
time, and I will submit my questions for the record for you 
all. I certainly want to know how we can make public transit 
safer and better for every rider. Thank you.
    Chairman Brown [presiding]. Thank you, Senator Britt.
    And you, as witnesses, do not know this but she is a 
freshman and she has sat through these hearings more than 
anyone else, and I really appreciate that so thank you for 
that, plus asking intelligent questions. Quite a combination.
    Senator Warner, of Virginia, is recognized.
    Senator Warner. Are you presuming by that introduction that 
I am not asking intelligent questions?
    Chairman Brown. Actually, I was.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Warner. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    First of all, Mr. McMillan, let me join others who 
expressed their condolences about your member, the bus driver, 
in Baltimore, who I know you had to visit. And obviously as we 
saw through COVID, the men and women who not only you represent 
but who work across transit systems did not have an option of 
working at home during COVID, and I appreciate very much their 
public service.
    I also want to pick up, though, I also want to acknowledge 
my new colleague from Alabama. I would maybe differ with her a 
bit in terms of the banking issue in that I think that, 
candidly, the ramifications of the businesses that particularly 
came out of tech were not just in California. They were all 
across the country and would not have been able to meet 
payroll. They were depositors. This was not a case of bailing 
out the bank. The banks who were responsible, the leadership 
and the regulators, should be held accountable, and I think 
basic prudential regulation should have and would have been 
able to spot this.
    But one of the things--and I am not going to ask the 
question on this but I just want to re-raise it--I am not 
sure--I think we saw the first internet-driven bank run--I am 
not sure what regulatory standards would have worked when you 
had $42 billion of capital leave in a single day, driven over 
the internet, frankly, by some of the same VCs who subsequently 
were looking for support. And I say that as a former VC. I am 
not sure what the regulatory structure for that would be. But 
on a comparison basis, when Washington Mutual went down, there 
was a run, but it was $16 billion leaving the bank over a 10-
day period. So there was some ability to prepare. The fact that 
you had 25 cents on every dollar being pulled on a single 
morning raises a set of questions that I am not sure we have 
thought through.
    But transit, and I am very proud of being one of the 
bipartisan groups that negotiated the infrastructure bill, $39 
billion for transit, critically important. Hearing some of my 
other colleagues I have got to ask a local question first and 
then I will get a general question, and I will ask you, Ms. 
Birdsong Terry.
    One of the things that we are very concerned about in 
Virginia, and for the whole DMV, is making sure we have another 
transit rail bridge across the Potomac. We have a bottleneck 
that hurts northern Virginia, but frankly hurts the whole 
region, the commuters who go into Maryland as well as the 
District.
    So the Long Bridge project is a chokepoint. You have 
spoken, Ms. Birdsong Terry, about this need of interconnection 
between light rail, heavy rail, other transit systems. You may 
not know about the Long Bridge project, but if you can talk 
about getting rid of these chokepoints and again, how critical 
that bipartisan infrastructure funding would be to that project 
and projects across all of our communities.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. Absolutely. Thank you for the question. 
It is absolutely imperative. We have got to be able to make 
sure, as an industry, that we do not create our own hurdle, and 
I think that the lack of capital investment in those particular 
bridges and other infrastructure that serve as a connector is a 
problem. And in public transit we have a very limited set of 
funds, as you are well aware, and it varies from State to 
State. And so you have got a local fight, you have got a State 
fight, and then you have got a Federal discussion, at some 
points.
    As was mentioned by my colleagues, you love when you get a 
grant, if I can say that, but you are never sure what you are 
going to get from year to year. And making sure that we have a 
leveling of the playing field through investments like IIJA are 
something that we have to have in order to survive. And making 
sure that we have those connections I really think allow public 
transit to become real in certain areas that maybe do not have 
it or have limited, and then also that economic vitality of the 
system as well.
    We are a major player in making sure that people can 
actually get to work. So when you look at things like sales 
tax, and you look at just the economics of any urban area, or 
rural for that matter, public transit has to make sure that we 
have those connections. Otherwise, folks cannot get to work, 
they cannot get to hospitals, and they really are dying in 
their homes, to be quite honest.
    Senator Warner. Well, and I appreciate that, and I do 
think, you know, finally in light of the infrastructure bill, 
the Feds are actually putting their money where their mouth is, 
and this will be incumbent now on the States and localities.
    I am going to ask, very quickly, Mr. Chairman, one last 
question for the panel. You know, I, along with my Maryland 
colleagues, and Senator Kaine are intimately involved in the 
challenges that Washington Metro faces. We have been very 
supportive in finally getting our rail opened to Dulles and 
beyond. But Washington Metro is not unique in that they are 
still struggling with the challenge of getting ridership back. 
I am sure all of you are facing this.
    So how do we balance this notion of getting ridership back 
and potentially then communities lowering fares, which may help 
on short-term incentives but it also kind of puts further out 
of whack the overall financing. I would just love top line from 
each of you on, maybe I will start down here and I will end up 
with you, Ms. Birdsong Terry. Mr. McMillan?
    Mr. McMillan. Yes. Thank you. Well, this is part of what 
the ATU supports. We support that the FTA, this Federal 
funding, for capital projects, that it can be used for the 
operating budget. That way, when, as you mentioned earlier, the 
COVID, it slowed down the ridership. It is hard to bounce back 
from that. The Federal funding that was brought in for that, it 
was greatly appreciated. It helped. But that funding is running 
out.
    So if we can use a portion of this funding for operating 
costs, the service cuts will not have to happen. They will be 
able to make for tension of hiring bus operators to support the 
routes. Because more people have been working from home. What 
we depend on, in Maryland public transportation, is the farebox 
recovery. So that includes the gas tax, because people were not 
going to work, that is down. Those in the shopping centers, the 
taxes from that, that was down, because, you know, for almost 2 
years, malls--the stores were closed, and a lot of other stores 
did not reopen.
    So we do support using that capital funding to be able to 
be used for the operating budget.
    Senator Warner. Mr. Keel.
    Mr. Keel. Good morning. I would definitely say that we have 
a major capital problem really across all infrastructure in 
this country, and transit is no different. So the investment 
are certainly a good step forward, if we look at the number of 
applications that were received in both RAISE and the Bus and 
Bus Facilities Grants, we have a huge need that is still not 
met. So the investments are exceptionally important there.
    You know, as we look at fares and getting ridership back, I 
think that is a huge step forward. At the same time, I also 
think agencies are going to need the time to do some reflecting 
and some homework to make sure that we understand what the new 
normal is, meaning that a lot of these commuters that were 
riders pre-pandemic may never come back, and we may need to 
adjust our service delivery systems to adjust to what the 
current expectations are and prepare for what the new future 
is. And I think that we all have to do that independently and 
figure out what works in our communities.
    As it relates to fares specifically for us, we have fare-
capping. You know, you spend $50 a month if you have a card or 
$25 if you are half fare. And we are looking at basically a 
fare-free program if you are a low-income individual that 
qualifies.
    So we are really trying to make sure that we are not having 
any barriers to somebody getting back to work or being able to 
use our system to get to medical appointments or any other 
services they need.
    Senator Warner. Last word.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry. Thank you. I appreciate the question. 
In Ohio we have a varied system. We have got upwards of 15 or 
16 different agencies throughout the State that provide 
transportation. So understanding what ridership means is really 
varied depending on who you talk to.
    I do think that the availability of funds definitely helped 
public transit, making sure that we are not focused on cuts and 
we are not in the scrambling mode every year, being able to 
allow us the ability to be innovative.
    I agree with my colleagues that I think it is on us to be 
innovative, and we have got to make sure that we can figure out 
what the attracters are beyond just the basic tenets of 
ridership. So being able to think about flex funding is really 
important so that we do not have that burden.
    I would say that we also need to make sure that we have 
equity involved through fare-capping and other mechanisms, to 
make sure that people feel like they are involved in the 
process and that they also have a safe system to rely on. But I 
would definitely agree that the inclusion of us in the funding 
kind of conundrum is really important because it allows us to 
make sure we make better business decisions and we do not have 
to focus on the volatility of the budget from year to year.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Warner.
    Senator Warner. Mr. Chairman, I know I am out of time, but 
I just want to say quickly----
    Chairman Brown. Three seconds. Three seconds.
    Senator Warner.----this conundrum about how you balance 
fares versus accessibility is a challenge. Thank you.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Warner.
    Today has been an important opportunity for all of us on 
this Committee to hear from the real experts in public 
transportation, from different regions of the country, people 
who work every day to deliver better service and provide safer 
service. I know all three of you do.
    I hope we can use today's hearing to continue this 
Committee's history of working together on transit service. We 
can focus on implementation of the infrastructure law to help 
address safety and modernization and expansion, if we can make 
sure the formula finds what Mr. Keel described as 
``lifeblood''--good word--are more available and continue to 
modernize buses and trains.
    Thank you again. For Senators who wish to submit questions 
for the record those questions are due 1 week from today, 
Thursday, March 23rd. To the witnesses, please submit your 
responses to questions for the record no more than 45 days from 
the time you receive them.
    With that the hearing is adjourned. Thank you all.
    [Whereupon, at 11:54 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
    [Prepared statements supplied for the record follow:]

              PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERROD BROWN
    I am excited to hear today what public transit means to people in 
Cleveland, Ohio, in Greenville, South Carolina, and in Baltimore, 
Maryland. But before that, I want to say a few words about the people 
of East Palestine, Ohio, and the aftermath of the Silicon Valley Bank 
collapse.
    They both have one thing in common:
    Companies followed the Wall Street business model, obsessed with 
short-term profits, at the expense of everything and everyone else.
    They were aided and abetted by corporate lobbyists and the 
politicians who do their bidding, weakening rules meant to protect the 
people we serve.
    And now, working people in Ohio and around the country are paying 
the price.
    As the Nation now knows, East Palestine is a tightknit town in 
Columbiana County, Ohio, which once made 80 percent of the ceramics in 
this country, before those jobs--like so many in our State--moved 
overseas, where companies pay workers less.
    This town--and neighboring communities in Beaver County, 
Pennsylvania--are the kinds of places that are too often forgotten or 
exploited by corporate America.
    Now, these Ohioans are worried about whether their water is safe to 
drink, whether the air is safe to breathe, whether their kids will get 
sick, and--of interest to this Committee--what happens to the value of 
their homes. All because of a train derailment caused by a corporate 
culture of cutting corners.
    Norfolk Southern chose to invest much of its massive profits in 
making its executives and shareholders wealthier, at the expense of the 
Ohio communities along its rail tracks like East Palestine and 
Steubenville and Sandusky and Springfield.
    The company followed the Wall Street business model: boost profits 
and its stock price by eliminating 38 percent of its workers over 10 
years, and then spend $3.4 billion on stock buybacks last year, instead 
of investing in its workers and investing in safety.
    Senator Vance and I have come together to introduce our Railway 
Safety Act, to make trains safer as they go through communities like 
East Palestine.
    We are working with the Commerce Committee to move that legislation 
forward quickly. For decades, the railroads have lobbied to undermine 
safety rules. They are fighting basic requirements like having two crew 
members in a train.
    The railroads think that a train that is more than two-miles long 
only needs one crew member.
    We know what it's about--cut costs to boost profits, the 
communities along their routes be damned.
    It's the same story with Silicon Valley Bank.
    For as long as we've had big banks, they've had too much power in 
this town.
    It's how we got the financial crisis of 2008 that wiped out 
workers' savings and permanently set back an entire generation of young 
Americans.
    But, of course, Wall Street didn't change its ways.
    Wall Street banks spent the ensuing years lobbying to roll back 
safeguards we passed in the wake of that crisis.
    The now-defunct Silicon Valley Bank spent hundreds of thousands of 
dollars pushing for exemptions for banks like theirs.
    Their CEO said that they shouldn't be subject to strong guardrails 
because of, quote, the ``low-risk profile of our activities and 
business model.''
    ``Low-risk profile.''
    We all know what they really wanted to do--maximize profits, risks 
be damned.
    Now look what's happened. The paychecks of thousands of Ohioans 
were at stake last weekend because of these Silicon Valley Bank 
executives' arrogance and incompetence.
    When we let corporations run the economy, workers and their 
families always, always pay the price--whether it's for the greed of 
Norfolk Southern or Silicon Valley Bank, or Big Pharma or Big Oil.
    There's a pretty simple question at stake in everything we do in 
these jobs:
    Whose side are you on?
    Do you stand with corporate lobbyists, or do you stand with 
communities like East Palestine?
    Do you stand with Silicon Valley venture capitalists, or do you 
stand with small businesses?
    Do you stand with Wall Street, or do you stand with workers?
    It's the same fight, over and over.
    As this Committee looks at how to respond to this latest in the 
long line of financial industry failures, I hope my colleagues will put 
partisanship aside--as Senator Vance and I are doing on rail safety--to 
stand with the people we serve.
    Turning to transit, our Committee worked on a bipartisan basis to 
include the biggest investment in transit EVER in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law.
    Better transit means new zero-emission and low-emission buses. And 
it means faster, safer service so that more people can get to the 
doctor, to the grocery store, to work, to church.
    It means more opportunity for all the communities that have been 
ignored and exploited for so long--whether they're Black and brown 
communities, or small towns, or rural areas, or all of the above.
    I am looking forward to working with Ranking Member Scott on 
transit issues. Today, we have witnesses today from both of our home 
States.
    We will hear how the Cleveland RTA is improving their bus and rail 
services for riders. The RTA has been planning their investments in new 
rail cars for many years, and because of the work we did on the 
infrastructure law, they're finally going to be able to get better cars 
for Northeast Ohioans.
    Cleveland is also home to the HealthLine on Euclid Avenue, one of 
the best bus rapid transit corridors in the country. And they are 
joining other transit agencies in Ohio to expand that faster service.
    Ms. Birdsong Terry is deeply committed to attracting new workers to 
the transit industry, and to ensuring those workers have the training 
they need.
    I am also interested to hear how Greenlink will grow in the years 
ahead to meet the mobility needs of Greenville, South Carolina.
    And we are lucky to have the President of the Amalgamated Transit 
Union's Baltimore local 1300. Mr. McMillan has been an important 
partner to the Committee in making transit safer for riders and 
workers.
    We have an opportunity this Congress to listen to local voices and 
to learn how to help more Americans enjoy high-quality transit service.
    We begin that work today.
                                 ______
                                 
                PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR TIM SCOTT
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I start my comments on Silicon 
Valley Bank and the failures there, I'd like to acknowledge the fact 
that today I get to share this hearing with Mr. Keel from my home State 
of South Carolina. I look forward to hearing the testimony of all three 
witnesses.
    But, Mr. McMillan, I realize that just last night at midnight, the 
issue of public safety and transit safety came home. One of your bus 
operators was stabbed twice-twice last night. I'm sure you were up 
through the night, focusing on the issues that you care most about--the 
safety of your operators. So sorry to hear about the devastating news 
that seems to be repeated too many times in too many places around this 
country. The safety of our transit system is a major question and a 
major failure that we need to address. Thank you for being here this 
morning, because I cannot imagine how difficult it is to show up here 
when your thoughts and your heart [have] to be with your operators. But 
more importantly, I can't think of a better time to be here to talk 
about the issues that have such a drastic and strong impact than to 
talk about it today at the Banking hearing. So, thank you for being a 
part of this Committee this morning. Thank you for participating, and 
certainly our prayers and our thoughts are with your operators.
    As it relates to the failure of the Silicon Valley Bank. There is 
no question that the failure should be seen through the three prisms. 
One, is the failure of the bank executives and the board. They were 
betting on interest rates going down when there was a clear sign from 
the Fed that interest rates were going up--not one time, not two times, 
not four times, not six times, but eight increases. And the bank 
management and the board sat there, idly by, doing nothing. That is a 
travesty and has had a devastating impact on our financial systems.
    The good news is our financial system remains strong. It is well-
capitalized, and frankly the rules that have been in place, the laws 
that have been passed are, in fact, doing [their] job. The challenge, 
of course, is when regulators refuse to do their jobs and enforce the 
laws. The law is not the problem. If you pass more laws and more 
regulators don't do their jobs, what good is the law? We have seen this 
way too often. The regulators were literally, or figuratively, asleep 
at the wheel.
    We see that playing out throughout the SVB failure, Signature 
failure, and other bank failures. We know that the San Francisco Fed 
failed twice. Obvious issues of liquidity, rising. JPMorgan in November 
of last year indicated that without any question, the situation at the 
Silicon Valley Bank was dangerous. A financial blogger in December saw 
what the regulators refused to see, which was the dire situation, not 
developing, already in place--already in place at SVB. And yet, our 
regulators did absolutely, positively nothing. When we had an 
opportunity to ask about the last time an examination happened at the 
bank, our regulators could not answer the question.
    We look at the incredible explosion of inflation devastating our 
Nation in every single State. And what we see is, as inflation rises 
really fast, to a 40-year high, the Fed's responsibility is to try to 
tame the inflationary effects in our economy. What does that look like? 
It looks like interest rates going up very quickly, so fast that the 
securities portfolio at SVB was in the wrong position and the 
management decided to do nothing.
    A failure of the bank, a failure with the regulators, and without 
any question, a failure at the top, which is the President of the 
United States, that created an inflationary effect that we haven't 
seen. So, it led to the fastest increase in interest rates we've seen 
in more than three decades. That combination is devastating to American 
families, but more importantly--this is part that I want to make sure 
we don't miss--the average person in our country has a bank balance of 
around $5,000. And those folks, because of the actions of the 
regulators and this Administration, will now be bailing out those who 
had balances of $5 million. Some will say ``it's not a bailout, it's 
not a bailout, it's not tax dollars.'' Well, according to the law, the 
special assessment fee that will be imposed upon banks could be as high 
as $220 billion. Banks don't print money. The Fed prints money, but 
banks do not print money. So, who bears the burden of that special 
assessment, whatever it turns out to be? It's everyday account holders, 
who have to pay higher interest rates and/or pay higher fees associated 
with the policies or the products they purchase at these banks.
    And [SVB] was an anomaly, without any question. But when the 
regulators are asleep, and the inflation is at a 40-year high, and the 
Fed goes to work, bad things happen to everyday Americans. So, let's 
not simply think about this from the perspective of the bank, which 
they need to be closed, action needed to happen, but the question is, 
is the action of this Government imperiling more Americans with very 
few dollars in their accounts, comparatively speaking, to the venture 
capitalists that this Administration has decided to insulate?
    To our hearing today: Maybe some of you don't realize this, but I 
served on the county council a number of years ago. I spent 13 \1/2\ 
years in local government. It was the most remarkable experience one 
might ever have. It gave me an opportunity not only to be the chairman 
of the county and to prepare for natural disasters, like hurricanes, 
but it also gave me an opportunity to serve on the board of directors 
of CARTA--which is the Charleston association of transportation in the 
area of Charleston, South Carolina.
    So, I spent a number of years on and off the board, and one of the 
things I realized is that mass transportation is a local issue--
fundamentally a local issue--and local issues need local solutions.
    I look forward to having a conversation about how we can be helpful 
in this conversation, but I want us to not lose the point that mass 
transit is very different in each one of our States--very different in 
each one of our communities even in our States. Charleston needs are 
very different than Greenville needs. So they may have some 
similarities but the one thing that none of us have, as far as I can 
tell--please raise your hand if you have a lot of extra money hanging 
around somewhere on the balance sheet with nothing to do with it--
giving extra priorities, whether it's ESG, whether it's electric 
vehicles, without actually the resources to deliver on the mandates is 
irresponsible.
    Our Federal Government continues to provide more mandates, more 
challenges, and no actual answers or actionable items to change the 
trajectory of local transit except for to cost more money.
    The right to choose the right ridership, the right routes is a 
difficult one, in and of itself. Challenging to make sure that the 
passengers are on the vehicles at the best times, the peak times, and 
not the buses or the trains running empty--real challenges that you 
have.
    The challenges of managing a local transportation system are 
immense. What you don't need are more unanswered questions. You don't 
need those. You need more solutions, and we need to have more trust and 
confidence in the way that you manage your systems.
    I look forward to hearing your testimony. I look forward to having 
a conversation about some of the solutions that you all want us to take 
into consideration. I look forward to having a conversation about 
safety--that is of paramount importance that we spend too little time 
talking about it. We see it on the news, but we don't personalize the 
issues. These are everyday Americans trying to make a living and 
provide a much-needed source of transportation. And yet, too often, 
they feel unsafe. Not just the riders, but the operators. So, I look 
forward to hearing your testimony.

             PREPARED STATEMENT OF INDIA L. BIRDSONG TERRY
General Manager and Chief Executive Officer, Greater Cleveland Regional 
                           Transit Authority
                             March 16, 2023
    My name is India L. Birdsong Terry and I serve as the General 
Manager and Chief Executive Officer for the Greater Cleveland Regional 
Transit Authority (GCRTA). My transit career began at the Chicago 
Transit Authority (CTA), where I held key roles in planning, training 
and instruction, and operations. My career continued at WeGo Public 
Transit in Nashville, Tennessee, where I served as Chief Operating 
Officer until my move to Cleveland, Ohio, to serve as Chief Executive 
Officer in September 2019.
    The GCRTA is a legacy multimodal transit system providing bus, 
heavy and light rail, bus rapid transit (BRT) as well as paratransit, 
servicing approximately 100,000 customers daily. Our agency's annual 
operating budget stands at $324M, and our annual capital budget varies 
between $100-120M per year.
    Our newly crafted mission, Connecting the Community, allows us to 
support the diverse interests of Greater Cleveland. Understanding that 
public transportation is the connective tissue between neighborhoods 
and citizens, it is no surprise that the most frequent trips taken on 
GCRTA are comprised of journeys to work (60 percent), school (23 
percent) and healthcare (9 percent).
    As with many legacy public transportation systems throughout the 
country, GCRTA faces a tremendous hurdle--keeping up with our aging 
infrastructure's state of good repair needs. This most basic need is 
not only a facet of our daily operations at the garage level, but is 
also a part of the everyday experience for our customers as well. Basic 
expectations of a system that is timely, clean, safe, and flexible 
become more difficult to manage as our infrastructure ages with time.
    Federal funding such as the passage of the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (IIJA) are instrumental in our ability 
to manage the reasonable expectations of the riding public and deliver 
effective transportation services as planned. Simply put, the historic 
increases in Federal transit funding are essential, and are making a 
huge impact in Greater Cleveland. We thank you for the investment in 
GCRTA and the residents we serve.
    Impacts of the IIJA in Greater Cleveland:

  <bullet>  The IIJA increased GCRTA's annual formula funds by 30 
        percent, for the next 5 years. During that timeframe, GCRTA is 
        positioned to plan and complete multiple projects, including 
        the rehabilitation of our Waterfront Line Bridge that serves 
        the downtown community, including the Cleveland Brown's 
        Stadium, the Great Lakes Science Museum, the Flats at East bank 
        residential and entertainment district, and the Rock and Roll 
        Hall of Fame.

  <bullet>  Additionally, the IIJA created two new competitive grant 
        programs that help to address GCRTA infrastructure needs, 
        including:

    <bullet>  Rail Vehicle Replacement Program: to address the need to 
        replace aging rail fleets. Operating beyond their useful life, 
        GCRTA's rail vehicles currently average between 38 to 41 years 
        of age and need immediate replacement. To date, our agency has 
        raised $213M towards an overall program goal estimated at $393M 
        and have applied for funding to help close the gap.

    <bullet>  All-Station Accessibility Program (ASAP): to address the 
        need to bring older non-ADA Key Stations into ADA compliance. 
        GCRTA has 17 identified key stations and we were recently 
        awarded an ASAP grant to reconstruct our East 79th Street Light 
        Rail Station. Projects like these are integral to our ability 
        to level the playing field, regardless of physical ability or 
        location. Our commitment to equitable mobility and access is 
        reflected not only in our construction efforts, but also in our 
        agency leadership, as evidenced by our Board President, 
        Reverend Charles P. Lucas, who serves as a community 
        trailblazer and advocate for the paratransit community. We 
        couldn't be prouder to have him at the helm of our agency in 
        this regard.

    <bullet>  Low-No Emission Bus Program: support the transition to 
        zero-emission fleet planning. We currently have converted over 
        half of our overall bus fleet from diesel to Compressed Natural 
        Gas (CNG), including our Healthline Vehicles. As our diesel to 
        CNG conversion continues, GCRTA's Strategic Plan calls for our 
        agency to begin piloting zero-emission/electric bus technology. 
        We will continue application for funding, and should we be 
        awarded we are in a ready position to launch the program.

    <bullet>  Over the next year, we will retire all 40-ft diesel buses 
        and will continue a policy of purchasing only clean air or 
        zero-emission buses. The Alternative Fuel Tax Credit has 
        resulted in a considerable savings in our fuel expense.

    <bullet>  The Capital Improvement Grant (CIG) opens the funding 
        pipeline for several New Starts/Small Starts projects around 
        the country. A great example of this is GCRTA's West 25th 
        Street/Metro Health Line BRT, which was recently recommended 
        for 25 percent funding of the total project cost by the Ohio 
        Department of Transportation.

    Public safety is the cornerstone of our operations at GCRTA. To 
support this charge, we have worked in partnership with our local 
unions to update our Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP). 
This effort was celebrated in the form of successful Board adoption of 
the new PTASP, created by management and union leadership. We 
understand that communication and realistic goal setting paves the way 
for positive change.
    Safety in policy can only become real through boots-on-the-ground 
leadership. As such, our agency has taken several actions to transform 
our transit police with practices that include and compliment our 
mission of Connecting the Community. In addition to assigning officers 
to community policing, we have added a Transit Ambassador program that 
includes 10 Ambassadors and 6 Crisis Intervention Specialists. These 
social service professionals work in close partnership with social 
service agencies to address the needs of our most vulnerable customers.
    As we continue to invest in the safety and experience of our 
customers, we also recognize the need to address current workforce 
challenges facing our industry, as it relates to the hiring and 
retention of local talent, in addition to growing the next generation 
of transportation professionals. To do this, GCRTA has partnered with 
local educational institutions, starting with Cuyahoga Community 
College (Tri-C). This partnership is special, as our Job Hub program 
has blossomed as a national model of community workforce development, 
to connect job seekers to college curriculum and pathways to permanent 
employment. Together, we are creating a learning culture centered on 
recruitment, retention, and development of employees at all levels.
    On behalf of GCRTA, I urge your continued support of funding for 
public transportation. It is my honor to serve our community and 
testify on behalf of the Greater Cleveland community. I am pleased to 
answer any questions you may have.

                 PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL McMILLAN
            President, Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1300
                             March 16, 2023
    My name is Michael McMillan. I am the President/Business Agent of 
Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1300 in Baltimore, MD. Local 1300 
represents more than 2,200 active frontline operations and maintenance 
workers at the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA). Prior to becoming 
president, I served as a subway operator for 7 years, and I drove a bus 
at MTA for 15 years.
    I would like to focus on three areas where the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) is already helping to improve the 
quality of public transportation in Baltimore: funding, safety, and 
workforce development.
Funding
    Our transit system in Baltimore has been dealing with some very 
well-known challenges for a long time. MTA has been criticized for its 
lack of efficiency and accessibility for years. Our new Governor, Wes 
Moore, says MTA is ``chronically unreliable.'' We have gaps in service, 
especially for people who live in the eastern and western cores, Park 
Heights and south of the Middle Branch of the Patapsco. For many MTA 
riders, there are no direct routes.
    Many Baltimore residents don't own their own car, and they need the 
bus or the train to survive. For far too many people, a commute to work 
can take well over an hour \1\ and involve multiple transfers. Making 
ends meet is hard enough, but when you need to tack on an extra 2 hours 
each day just to get to work and back, it's tough.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In the Washington, DC, area, WMATA riders only earn 4 percent less 
than the income profile of the service area. In contrast, Baltimore 
transit riders earn 35 percent less than the income profile of our 
service area. We are primarily operating a system for people of color 
who totally rely on public transit, and we are proud to deliver for 
them as best we can.
    With support from the IIJA, we have revived plans to finally build 
the Red Line to connect East and West Baltimore by rail. This is a 
project to connect low-income neighborhoods with few jobs to other 
areas where employment opportunities exist. That is sorely needed in 
our city.
    We are excited about Governor Moore's enthusiasm for public 
transit. The new Governor has proposed $500 million to fund 
transportation projects. U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg 
announced last summer that $26.5 million in IIJA funds will be used to 
upgrade Penn Station in Baltimore, and we are certainly grateful for 
that. Our members and customers know that Penn Station needs the help 
desperately. We also need more covered bus shelters and bus stops that 
comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for our 
passengers with special needs.
    The bill sets up a competitive process, and we think that Baltimore 
will stack up well against any city. Our system has enormous capital 
needs. Between 2022 and 2031, MTA's total capital needs are expected to 
reach more than $6.3 billion a year of expenditure dollars, including 
an inflation rate of three percent on all needs. \2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Thanks to the work of this Committee, MTA's annual formula funding 
under the IIJA is projected to exceed $200 million from now until 2026. 
This money comes just in the nick of time to upgrade our crumbling 
infrastructure, some of which can be traced to the streetcars operated 
by the old Baltimore Transit Company and its parent companies in the 
1890s.
    We can and will do better. In November of 2022, MTA announced the 
rollout of real-time tracking and predicted arrival information for the 
Light RailLink line. This was a 5-year project. Now riders have the 
ability to know where all five of our fixed-route modes are and when 
they are most likely to arrive at a given stop. Our customers like it a 
lot.
    Ridership is starting to bounce back from the pandemic period. 
We've got people who rely on transit to get to work, the doctor, and to 
see family and friends. For us, the infrastructure bill funding comes 
at just the right time and will hopefully help us to serve our 
community better.
Safety
    On October 8, 2020, MTA bus driver Marcus Parks, Sr. was shot 10 
times and killed in the 1200 block of East Fayette Street. The shooter 
and his girlfriend tried to steal Marcus' backpack, and he fought back. 
Marcus was just 51-years old. He had a wife, three sons, and two 
grandchildren.
    That story was all over the news. What the public doesn't hear 
about are all the rest of the brutal attacks on MTA workers daily. 
Francine Merritt, an MTA station agent, was assaulted in a ticket 
machine incident, struck in the head with a blunt object. Francine was 
in the hospital for two months. Thankfully, she doesn't remember the 
incident.
    The transit worker assault crisis is a nationwide problem. We have 
had members shot, stabbed, and struck with canes, fire extinguishers, 
screwdrivers, hammers, and garbage cans. They have been sprayed with 
mace and pepper spray, burned with hot coffee, and doused in urine and 
spit. We have had senior citizen bus operators robbed for pocket change 
and women sexually assaulted. This constitutes a regular day on the job 
in the transit industry.
    We are so grateful to Senator Van Hollen, the chief sponsor of the 
Transit Worker and Pedestrian Protection Act, and all the Members of 
this Committee who cosponsored the legislation and fought to get it 
included in the infrastructure bill. You have saved countless lives.
    The bill includes major changes to the Federal Transit 
Administration's (FTA) Public Transportation Safety Program. A few 
years ago, FTA required all transit systems to develop and submit 
Public Transportation Agency Safety Plans (PTASPs) in order to qualify 
for FTA funding.
    The PTASPs deal with all aspects of transit safety, including 
assaults on workers and other matters. However, before the IIJA, PTASPs 
were developed and submitted to FTA only by transit boards and general 
managers. Workers and unions had little role at all.
    The new bill fundamentally changes the PTASP process. Under the 
IIJA, before management submits their safety plan to FTA, a safety 
committee of the transit system must develop and approve the agency 
safety plan and any updates to the agency safety plan. Significantly, 
the safety committee must be convened by a joint labor-management 
process; and consist of an equal number of:

  <bullet>  (I) frontline employee representatives, selected by a labor 
        organization representing the plurality of the frontline 
        workforce employed by the transit system or, if applicable, a 
        contractor to the transit system and

  <bullet>  (II) management representatives.

    For any transit system serving an urbanized area with a population 
of fewer than 200,000, safety plans must be developed in 
``cooperation'' with frontline employee representatives.
    Also, for the first time, Federal law now includes a definition of 
``Assault on a transit worker.'' It is defined to mean ``Any 
circumstance in which an individual knowingly, without lawful authority 
or permission, and with intent to endanger the safety of any 
individual, or with a reckless disregard for the safety of human life, 
interferes with, disables, or incapacitates any transit worker while 
the transit worker is performing his or her duties.''
    This means that any time there is ``interference'' with a transit 
worker, it is considered to be an ``assault.'' This is a low threshold. 
Any spitting, shoving, verbal abuse, etc., that has been dismissed in 
past years by transit agency management or law enforcement can no 
longer be ignored.
    The bill requires:

  <bullet>  Transit systems to report all assaults (using the new 
        definition) and pedestrian/bus collision incidents to the 
        National Transit Database (NTD), which is maintained by FTA.

  <bullet>  Safety plans to include strategies to minimize exposure to 
        infectious diseases; safety performance measures; a 
        comprehensive safety training program for the operations and 
        maintenance personnel; and a risk reduction program for transit 
        operations to improve safety by reducing the number of 
        accidents, injuries, and assaults on transit workers.

  <bullet>  Safety committees to establish performance targets for the 
        risk reduction program using a 3-year average of NTD data.

  <bullet>  Transit systems to reduce vehicular and pedestrian 
        accidents involving buses that includes measures to reduce 
        visibility impairments for bus operators that contribute to 
        accidents, including retrofits to buses in revenue service and 
        specifications for future procurements that reduce visibility 
        impairments.

  <bullet>  Mitigation of assaults on transit workers, including the 
        deployment of assault mitigation infrastructure and technology 
        on buses, including barriers to restrict the unwanted entry of 
        individuals and objects into the workstations of bus operators 
        when a risk analysis performed by the safety committee of the 
        transit system determines that such barriers or other measures 
        would reduce assaults on transit workers and injuries to 
        transit workers.

  <bullet>  Transit systems to set aside not less than 0.75 percent of 
        their formula funds for safety-related projects.

    A transit system that does not meet the performance targets must 
allocate their safety funds set aside in the following year to safety 
projects. Funds shall be used for projects that are reasonably likely 
to assist the transit system meet the performance targets, including 
modifications to rolling stock and de-escalation training.
FTA Implementation of Safety Committees
    We are working toward long-term change in the industry, and the new 
labor-management safety committees required under the IIJA provide a 
path forward to achieve important safety goals. Unfortunately, transit 
management nationwide is pushing back hard against Labor and the 
requirements of the law.
    More than one-third of our bargaining units report that management 
has not established a joint safety committee, despite the FTA deadline 
of July 31, 2022. In nearly half of these cases, management is delaying 
and taking too long to establish the committee. In more than 30 percent 
of transit systems without committees, the union has met with 
management to establish a committee, but that work is not complete. 
Remarkably, we still have transit agencies falsely claiming that they 
are not covered by IIJA, managers attempting to appoint union-side 
committee members, and claims from management that preexisting joint 
committees are IIJA-compliant despite the clear absence of basic 
statutorily mandated features, including equal representation from 
frontline workers and management.
    Further, dozens of transit systems employing the members of ATU-
represented bargaining units have ignored the December 31, 2022, 
deadline to update their PTASPs with the approval of their joint safety 
committees.
    ATU International has provided FTA with a list of agencies that 
have either failed to form labor-management safety committees or 
updated their plans by the deadline, and the agency is relying on ATU 
to determine which agencies are out of compliance with the law.
    In Baltimore, we are working in a partnership with management to 
meet the IIJJA requirements, and it is working well. We have formed a 
committee of 14 people, 7 on each side, which successfully agreed upon 
a PTASP update by the end of 2022. We are working to address the 
assault issue and exchanging ideas, just as Congress envisioned. Long 
term, ATU International is urging FTA to provide funding to build a 
prototype of the ``Bus of the Future,'' which will prevent assaults; 
increase driver visibility and minimize blind spots; increase passenger 
accessibility; improve driver ergonomics; reduce driver distractions; 
and remediate respiratory hazards by improving air quality on vehicles.
Other Safety Matters
    Two people in a car died in an MTA bus accident a few years ago, 
and an arbitrator ruled that the bus blind spot issues we presented 
were the primary cause of the crash. The IIJA requires us to deal with 
those issues too.
    Moreover, MTA has had many other issues that we plan to raise on 
the safety committee. The rail systems operated by MTA (MARC, Light 
RailLink and Metro SubwayLink) break down more than any other 
comparable rail systems in the country. \3\ In 2018, we had to shut 
down the entire Metro Subway system for almost a month after a routine 
safety inspection revealed large portions of the line's tracks were too 
worn to operate safely. The agency also had to begin replacing some of 
the most outdated parts of its light rail car fleet.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

the U.S.'' Greater Greater Washington, February 26, 2020. https://
ggwash.org/view/76315/these-numbers-show-why-marylands-mta-transit-
systems-break-down-more-than-any-others-in-the-us
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Moreover, we've had major safety problems in our maintenance shops 
over the years. Prior to the rail shutdown, we warned management about 
high-voltage rat traps in public places where people could touch them, 
outdated and decomposing smoke detectors, exposed live wires, wet 
floors, a defective ventilation system, rusting pipes and substandard 
fire extinguishers. While the situation has improved, it is critical to 
stay on top of things so that we don't go down that road again.
So-Called ``Operator Shortage'' is Directly Tied to Safety
    Much has been written about frontline worker shortages in many 
industries since the pandemic. The transit industry is certainly 
impacted by this, Baltimore included. We are short-staffed in heavy 
rail, light rail, and in the stations. MTA has 135 positions on the bus 
side that are currently not filled. The staff shortages, of course, 
have a direct impact on service levels. Some agencies just don't have 
the manpower to put fixed-route buses on the street at the levels that 
are truly needed. This results in long headways and frustrated 
passengers, which in turn leads to more assaults. It is a vicious 
cycle.
    However, we take issue with the idea that this is a ``bus operator 
shortage.'' There are, of course, many people who could apply for these 
jobs. They just choose not to do so, and who could blame them? With 
daily stories in the news about operators being attacked behind the 
wheel, and many jobs available in other safer industries with similar 
wages and benefits, it is no wonder why we have a problem attracting, 
recruiting, and retaining new employees.
    We hope that over time the labor-management safety committees can 
work to find innovative solutions to the challenges that all transit 
systems are facing, leading to other related discussions around 
recruitment and retention. For example, frontline workers in transit 
have serious childcare issues to deal with, and the industry has little 
schedule flexibility. Innovative ideas are needed to address these 
types of issues so that we can once again provide ``career'' jobs for 
people that are looking to make ends meet.
Workforce Development
    In Annapolis, our State Legislature recently passed a bill 
requiring MTA to transition its approximately 800 bus fleet to zero-
emission vehicles. The legislation makes the transition on an 
aggressive timeline, resulting in our fleet being more than 50 percent 
zero-emission by 2030. The current fleet is diesel and hybrid. This is 
a massive change. As many as 70 new zero-emission buses will soon be 
purchased each year. MTA leadership anticipates that our next 
procurement will be entirely zero-emissions vehicles, with delivery of 
vehicles beginning in 2025.
    Preventive maintenance on these new vehicles is quite different 
than it was just a few years ago, when a skilled mechanic could likely 
have made due with the contents of their tool box. Advances in computer 
technology have fundamentally changed the nature of the job. Yet, 
training has not kept pace, and huge skill gaps have developed. As a 
result, transit workers could lose out on work that they could easily 
perform. Moreover, without proper training, major safety issues arise, 
including the real possibility of electrocution.
    Only a handful of our members at Local 1300 are currently trained 
to work on these zero-emission vehicles, consistent with transit 
systems nationwide. As a result of the IIJA, MTA is going to receive 
critical funding to make the zero-emission bus transition a smooth one. 
The infrastructure bill provides $5.25 billion for  5339 Low or No 
Emission (Lo-No) Bus Competitive grants. Key for our members is the 
bill's requirement that 5 percent of this funding must be used by 
transit systems to fund workforce development training, including 
registered apprenticeships and other labor-management training 
programs. Moreover, in awarding competitive bus grants for projects 
related to zero-emission vehicles, the bill requires transit systems to 
submit zero-emission transition plans that demonstrate a long-term 
fleet management plan with a strategy for how they intend to use their 
funds. MTA must also examine the impact of the transition to zero-
emission buses on the current workforce and avoid the displacement of 
the existing workforce.
    Local 1300 is extremely grateful for the Banking Committee's 
inclusion of this language. As other industries have demonstrated, the 
best way to close skill gaps is through training--but not just any type 
of training. Apprenticeship programs established through labor-
management partnerships are without question the best way to address 
skills training. When both sides buy in, the results can be quite 
effective. While labor and management often disagree on various issues, 
in transit, we have recognized that by working together, we can provide 
training to workers with a thirst for the knowledge they need to move 
up the career ladder, while saving management precious resources that 
they can put into improved and expanded service. It's a win-win for 
everyone--and at all sizes and types of public and community 
transportation operations.
Conclusion
    ATU members are just average Americans who report to work each day 
to make an honest living to support themselves and their families. 
Millions of times per day, transit customers put their faith in our 
members to get them to work and back home safely. Our members operate 
and maintain massive vehicles, and we handle precious cargo. 
Unfortunately, a day in the life of a transit worker is not what it was 
in the days of Ralph Kramden. Danger lurks around every corner. There 
are easier and safer ways to earn a decent living other than navigating 
a 55-passenger bus down congested streets in all types of weather while 
collecting fares, enforcing regulations, and dodging punches and bodily 
fluids. Moreover, servicing these vehicles is now quite complicated.
    We are grateful for this Committee's understanding in the IIJA that 
it wasn't enough to simply pour money into our Nation's traditional 
infrastructure. Through this groundbreaking legislation, Congress 
recognized that if we as a society want to continue to create solid, 
union jobs and attract people to the transit industry, we must also 
invest in the people that make transit a critical part of our Nation's 
economy.
