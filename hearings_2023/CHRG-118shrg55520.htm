         OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION

                              ----------                              


                         THURSDAY, MAY 4, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
                 Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:00 a.m. in 
Room SD-366, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Joe Manchin 
III, Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

    The Chairman. The Committee will come to order.
    I am pleased to be joined by all four of our sitting 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Commissioners this 
morning. Thank you all for being here to discuss FERC's 
important work.
    First of all, I want to congratulate Chairman Phillips for 
a successful and productive few months since your appointment. 
As I said before, there is no such thing as an acting chair, 
and I am glad that you have been able to hit the ground 
running. I am grateful for your efforts so far to run the 
Commission efficiently and to work within your jurisdiction and 
our laws.
    This morning I look forward to discussing how FERC is 
addressing the critical energy challenges facing our nation. 
FERC is responsible for regulating natural gas markets and 
permitting the interstate infrastructure needed to move natural 
gas safely and efficiently. Of course, FERC is an independent 
agency, but policies and guidance of any given administration 
certainly can bear on your work. For example, guidance on NEPA 
and greenhouse gas impacts issued by the White House Council on 
Environmental Quality can influence the FERC's procedures. 
Administration policies also impact permits from other agencies 
that are required to build infrastructure regulated by FERC, 
and during this Administration, we have seen unprecedented 
delays developing the needed natural gas infrastructure, 
infrastructure that would have helped restore the supply and 
demand balance and lower prices across the world.
    According to the Energy Information Administration, in 
2022, we had the lowest amount of FERC-regulated natural gas 
pipeline infrastructure installed since EIA began tracking in 
1995. Incredibly, we built less last year than during the heart 
of the COVID-19 pandemic or the great recession. The only 
explanation is an administration doing everything they can to 
block new fossil energy. And while natural gas projects were 
stalled in 2022, natural gas prices soared to the highest level 
since 2008. If we learned anything during these energy price 
spikes last year, it's that Americans cannot afford for their 
government to blindly prioritize climate goals over the 
reliable and affordable energy they need to go about their 
daily lives. That said, I am glad that FERC appears to have 
heard the concerns last year from everyday Americans and from 
Members of Congress. We are starting to see FERC make decisions 
at a better pace. FERC approved more than ten billion cubic 
feet per day of natural gas pipeline permits and nearly six 
billion cubic feet per day of LNG export permits over the last 
12 months combined. That is more than triple what FERC approved 
during the 12 months prior. As you can see, in 2021, the blue 
represents the pipeline permits and the orange is the LNG 
exports. You can see how low they were, and then, with the war 
starting, we were not able to help our allies. You can see here 
that it picked up as far as the permits for pipelines. LNG was 
starting to come, and you can see what you all have done, which 
you should be commended for this.
    [Chart depicting FERC pipeline and LNG capacity approvals

    The Chairman. And in the past four months, FERC has been 
required to act on a bipartisan basis with only four members. 
Under the leadership of Chairman Phillips, the Commission has 
been particularly productive. As shown on the chart behind me, 
as I said, FERC permitted more natural gas infrastructure in 
just the last four months than in each of the prior two years. 
Furthermore, FERC appears to be easing off the policy that most 
natural gas projects require a full environmental impact 
statement, or an EIS, as we have known, instead of the more 
abbreviated environmental assessment, EA. This course 
correction has the potential to cut review times in half 
without cutting any corners. Some projects do warrant an EIS, 
the most comprehensive, time-intensive type of NEPA review, but 
there is no basis to make this the norm just because a project 
involves fossil fuels, as has been done in the past.
    The Federal Government does an EIS for less than one 
percent of projects. So it was not logical for FERC to say that 
the majority of gas projects before it needed one. However, 
despite these improvements, there is still a large shadow of 
uncertainty over whether FERC will revert to its ill-conceived 
natural gas and greenhouse gas policy statements issued earlier 
last year. These policies signaled that natural gas projects 
could be rejected simply because they transport the fossil 
fuel. Of course, we addressed those policies the last time you 
all were here before this Committee. So I look forward to 
hearing about how your views may or may not have changed.
    Now, turning to electricity. There is no doubt that our 
electric grid is undergoing a rapid transition both in 
generation sources and in the types of demand the grid is 
called on to serve. The speed of this transition must be 
balanced against reliability and affordability of electricity. 
The reliability of our electric grid has been put to the test 
in the last few years. Frankly, I am not sure it deserves a 
passing grade, and I am especially concerned that the grid will 
face worse going forward. In 2021, we had a major electric grid 
failure during a winter storm that affected millions of people 
in Texas and other states. And then again, this past Christmas, 
during Winter Storm Elliott, nearly every part of the U.S. grid 
was operating under emergency conditions. More than 1.5 million 
people lost power. If we can't provide Americans with reliable 
power on Christmas, then we definitely are failing at our job. 
I am pleased that FERC and the North American Electric 
Reliability Corporation (NERC) have issued new cold weather 
reliability standards to put us on firmer footing, but we need 
to do more. We need to get to work to figure out what is 
causing these reliability breakdowns and make the corrections 
that are needed. FERC and NERC must move with urgency and 
overcome resistance to changing the status quo, whether that be 
from industry, other regulators, or environmental advocates. We 
cannot wait until two winters from now. This needs to be 
addressed for this winter.
    While some may find these facts inconvenient, the reality 
is that our dispatchable coal power was one of the most 
reliable energy sources during the winter storms Uri and 
Elliott. Coal-powered plants saw significantly fewer outages 
than natural gas plants. The grid would have been absolutely 
decimated during these storms if our coal fleet was retired 
prematurely. Yet EPA and ESG investors are on a crusade to shut 
down every one of these coal plants, whether the grid is ready 
for it or not, whether the EPA's Effluent Limitation 
Guidelines, Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, Interstate Ozone 
Transport Rule, power plant CO<INF>2</INF> regulations or 
others--the potential reliability impacts of these combined 
regulations are simply staggering. And at the same time EPA is 
working to decrease power supply by fossil fuels, they are 
trying to force a dramatic surge in electricity demand with 
radical electric vehicle mandates in the tailpipe regulations, 
the expansion the of renewable fuel standard to include EVs, 
and more. FERC and NERC have not done enough to highlight and 
manage the reliability impacts of premature fossil retirements 
or significant changes to the load on the grid.
    We all agree that we need to address climate change. And 
the energy transition is happening faster than we imagined even 
a few years ago. But the only way to transition without 
sacrificing reliability and affordability is with policies that 
spur innovation, not elimination, so that we can use all of our 
energy resources in the cleanest way possible. It makes no 
sense at all to take tools out of the toolbox. No energy 
resource is immune to weather disruptions, whether that be 
frozen wind turbines, frozen gas wells, or frozen coal 
stockpiles, all of which we saw in recent winters.
    I also want to speak briefly about electric transmission, 
which is different from natural gas because states have primary 
responsibility for the siting of interstate projects. But 
similar to natural gas pipelines, high-voltage transmission 
construction has been declining when it should have been 
increasing. The fact of the matter is that large, multi-state 
transmission lines are needed for reliability, but they are 
rarely getting built. And when large lines are built, it is 
taking a decade or longer to get through the approval process. 
This is simply unacceptable. Transmission is about balancing 
supply and demand and moving electricity from where it is most 
abundant to where it is most needed. To help, in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law, we provided a long-overdue fix to the 
backstop transmission siting authority Congress gave to FERC 
back in 2005, to make it actually work, but it is clear that 
even this current pathway still has roadblocks to constructing 
the high-voltage, long-distance lines that are needed for 
reliability. I am interested to hear about FERC's activities to 
support transmission buildout in a thoughtful way that 
recognizes state regulators have the primary jurisdiction over 
siting and paying for these projects.
    Lastly, let me say a few words about permitting reform, as 
I know Ranking Member Barrasso released his proposal with the 
Ranking Member of EPW this morning. Last summer, I secured a 
commitment from the President and Democratic leadership that we 
would get long-overdue energy permitting done, finally. That 
led to a bill which 40 Democrats and seven Republicans voted 
for in December, and which I introduced earlier this week to 
kick-start promoting work in the Senate again this year, and it 
is the only bill that had bipartisan support. I am glad to have 
led the charge, getting the ball rolling last year. And while 
we should have gotten it done then, I believe we have another 
chance this year. So I am glad the Ranking Members have 
introduced--and my friend, Senator Barrasso--a proposal today. 
And I hope that we will now be able to begin a conversation 
that will lead to enacting a bipartisan law.
    Permitting reform is a topic this Committee knows well. As 
the Committee with jurisdiction over energy, we are intimately 
familiar with the roadblocks faced by energy projects. We have 
covered this in many hearings over the years. That includes 
conversations with Secretaries Granholm and Haaland over the 
last few weeks and with the FERC Commissioners today. Next 
week, we will bring in stakeholders to provide other 
perspectives on needed reforms. So I am heartened by the 
acknowledgement from both sides that we need to tackle 
permitting this year. I sincerely hope that now, with my 
proposal, and both the House and Senate Republican proposals on 
the table, that we are going to be able to sit down and 
negotiate in good faith, putting politics aside to craft a 
serious bipartisan proposal for permitting that can actually be 
signed into law.
    With that, I turn to Senator Barrasso, for his opening 
remarks.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING

    Senator Barrasso. Thanks so much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you 
for holding today's hearing. Chairman Phillips, members of the 
Commission, welcome back to the Committee. The Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission is a critically important agency. To 
quote Chairman Phillips from earlier this year, ``the services 
that the Commission regulates--energy, natural gas, 
electricity--seven percent of our economy. The first seven 
percent, because without our energy, there is so much that we 
cannot do.''
    So Chairman Phillips, I commend you for resetting the 
Commission's agenda. You have brought orders forward for 
discussions and for action. You have emphasized energy 
reliability and affordability. You have rightly highlighted the 
negative effects on families and on communities when energy 
prices are high. You have emphasized personal respect as a 
necessary condition for consensus on the Commission and 
elsewhere. Under your leadership, the Commission has made great 
progress since you took over just four months ago. I am not 
always agreeing with all your decisions--the Commission still, 
I believe, needs to do much more to accomplish what I expect is 
our shared goal of affordable, reliable, and secure energy for 
American families and businesses.
    We also should strive to produce enough energy to supply 
friendly nations seeking to reduce their dependence on hostile 
actors such as Russia. Currently, we are far from achieving 
these goals. Last month, the Energy Information Administration 
issued a report stating that in 2022, the least interstate 
natural gas pipeline capacity was added since they began data 
collection back in 1995. Our nation needs more and better 
energy infrastructure. The entities that finance, that build, 
that maintain and expand energy infrastructure and their 
customers rely on the Commission to act promptly. The 
Commission must speed up its process and balance energy 
interests more effectively. Companies and customers expect the 
Commission to act only within the scope of its authority. The 
U.S. Supreme Court has explained clearly the principal purpose 
of the Federal Power Act and Natural Gas Act, and that purpose 
is to encourage the orderly development of plentiful supplies 
of electricity and natural gas at just and reasonable rates.
    Commissioners, Congress has charged you with this mission 
and you must make it your central focus. You must resist those 
who want to use the Commission to circumvent Congress and 
fundamentally change the nation's energy sector. You must work 
to ensure that wholesale power markets reflect the value of 
reliable sources of energy. You must fight against litigation 
intended to block new and upgraded natural gas pipeline and 
electric transmission lines. You must resist efforts from other 
federal agencies to undermine the development of needed energy 
infrastructure. If you don't take these steps, energy prices 
will skyrocket, grid reliability will degrade, and families and 
businesses all across the country will suffer. We witnessed it 
in New England. We witnessed it in California and elsewhere. We 
have also witnessed it in Europe, before Russia's invasion of 
Ukraine, when energy regulators lost sight of their principal 
mission. This must not be the path that we follow as a nation.
    Commissioners, it is beyond time to take meaningful steps 
to address threats to reliable, affordable, and resilient 
electric service. The Commission must operate in a non-partisan 
manner, supporting this central mission. This is especially 
important when it comes to the Commission's most consequential 
decisions. For this reason, the now draft 2022 Natural Gas 
Policy Statement needs to be scrapped. The Commission needs to 
solely pursue reasonable and balanced policies that support the 
development of plentiful supplies of affordable electricity and 
natural gas.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Now we are going to hear from our Commissioners. We have 
Chairman Willie Phillips, who will start.

STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIE L. PHILLIPS, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL ENERGY 
                     REGULATORY COMMISSION

    Mr. Phillips. Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member Barrasso, 
members of the Committee, thank you so much for the opportunity 
to testify here today regarding the important work that we do 
on behalf of the American people. The Commission's jurisdiction 
is broad. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, Natural Gas Act, 
and Interstate Commerce Act, it is our responsibility to ensure 
that rates for the wholesale sale and transmission of 
electricity, as well as transportation of oil and natural gas 
by pipeline, are just and reasonable. In addition, we are 
responsible for ensuring that the nation's bulk power system 
remains reliable. And last, but by no means least, we are also 
responsible for siting vital energy infrastructure, including 
interstate natural gas pipelines, facilities for exporting and 
importing LNG, and hydroelectric facilities. By exercising 
these authorities in a prudent and responsible manner, the 
Commission can help ensure that our country produces energy 
that is reliable, affordable, and sustainable.
    Earlier this year, President Biden designated me as 
Chairman of the Commission, and I am honored to appear before 
you today for the first time in that capacity. In January, at 
my first meeting, I laid out three principal priorities. They 
are reliability, electric transmission, and environmental 
justice. I am happy to report to you today that in just a few 
short months, we have made substantial progress on all three 
fronts. I will begin with reliability because it is and it must 
be, always, job number one.
    We face unprecedented challenges to reliability on our 
nation's electric system. Foreign and domestic actors are 
testing our cyber defenses every day. Physical threats to the 
grid are on the rise. And extreme weather of all kinds is 
threatening the power to our customers. That is why, under my 
leadership, the Commission has taken at least one major action 
to promote reliability every month since I became Chairman. We 
have required NERC to develop enhanced cybersecurity standards 
regarding internal network security protocols. We have approved 
a series of winter preparedness measures, a new reliability 
standard to further protect our electric system supply chain, 
and a system of incentives to reward certain cybersecurity 
investments. These actions represent the blocking and tackling 
that is absolutely necessary to ensure that our electric grid 
remains secure, reliable, and resilient.
    My second priority, electric transmission--it is, itself, a 
reliability imperative. Transmission plays a critical role in 
facilitating the interconnection of new resources while 
ensuring that the electric system remains reliable. And 
transmission is the key that can unlock the potential of so 
many of the energy security measures included in the Inflation 
Reduction Act. To those ends, we are working as quickly as 
possible on a number of important rulemakings, and I will list 
just a few: number one, interconnection queue reform; two, 
regional transmission planning; and three, backstop siting 
authority.
    My third priority, environmental justice--this one is 
personal. I grew up in an environmental justice community in 
Alabama, so I have seen firsthand what it means for a community 
to bear more than its fair share of pollution and other costs 
of industrial development. But I have also seen benefits that 
investment can provide to historically underserved communities 
in the form of jobs, tax revenue, and community infrastructure. 
Having seen both sides, it is my goal as Chairman to do all 
that we reasonably can to ensure that environmental justice 
communities do not bear too great a share of the burdens or too 
small a share of the benefits that new energy infrastructure 
can provide. Here, too, we have made strides. We announced the 
hiring of a new Senior Counsel for Environmental Justice and 
Equity. And later in March, in the same month, we held the 
first ever roundtable on environmental justice and equity and 
infrastructure permitting.
    Finally, I would be remiss not to mention the significant 
strides we have made with respect to permitting. Our country 
urgently needs more energy infrastructure of all kinds. As 
Russia's war on Ukraine has made clear, energy infrastructure 
is essential to any country's national security. I am proud of 
the steps that the Commission has taken to streamline our 
permitting processes so that we can more efficiently issue our 
decisions, while at the same time, continue to enhance our 
reliability.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify here today. 
I look forward to answering your questions.

    The Chairman. And now, we are going to have Commissioner 
James Danly.

STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES P. DANLY, COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL ENERGY 
                     REGULATORY COMMISSION

    Mr. Danly. Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member Barrasso, 
members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to be 
here today. I want to talk about what I think is a looming 
reliability crisis in our electric markets, which is driven 
primarily by the effects of state and federal subsidies and 
FERC's maladministration of our markets.
    So the organized markets, the RTOs and ISOs, were 
originally conceived of decades ago as the mechanism by which 
we could give the benefits of competition to the ratepayers so 
that they get the least-cost generation and also to use market 
signals to effectively incentivize the arrival of needed new 
generation and the retention of existing generation to meet the 
load requirements. This theory has not been borne out, and the 
reason it hasn't been in our markets is because FERC has 
allowed the markets to fall prey to the price-distorting and 
warping effects of subsidies and public policies that have 
driven the advancement of large quantities of intermittent 
renewable resources onto the electric system and have done so 
basically because most of the ordinary economic costs that 
would drive the investment of capital have failed to actually 
be seen in the market mechanisms.
    So the subsidies in question in our markets--of course, I 
am speaking in broad-brush strokes--every market has a 
different tariff and different mechanisms, but in the main, the 
subsidies available are so lucrative that renewables are often 
able to offer into the procurement auctions at zero. And just 
think for a moment what that means in terms of a price signal. 
What that means is that generation is free. The market is 
saying there is no cost to this generation being built. Well, 
that is obviously not true. The effect of this is market-wide 
price suppression, and the effect of the market-wide price 
suppression is that it deprives the other generators that are 
not eligible for these subsides of much-needed revenue and they 
are forcing them into premature retirement. And the problem 
with that is that the generators that are being retired are the 
ones that have the attributes necessary--like spinning mass, 
inertia--they are the generators that actually have the 
attributes necessary to keep system stability. As an 
engineering matter, it is simply impossible to keep the system 
running entirely with unreliable, intermittent generation. That 
is just an engineering reality. And so we are employing these 
market mechanisms incorrectly because we are allowing them to 
fall prey to the subsidies.
    Why is this so critical? Well, in vertically integrated 
states, that is, the states that don't have our markets as the 
administrators, you have a regulatory process in which the 
utility and the state PUC figure out, through an integrated 
resource plan, what is needed to meet peak requirements. In our 
markets there is no other authority besides the market. There 
is no other mechanism other than the market signals to 
incentivize the arrival of generation, which means that if 
those market signals fail or if they are distorted, you will 
eventually, in the long run, have a failure to supply adequate 
resources to keep the system stable.
    Now, we have heard from our RTOs and ISOs that there is 
going to be a capacity shortfall in the future. MISO has said 
it. ISO-New England has said it. Even PJM, the largest of the 
markets, the one that serves Washington, has recently raised 
the human cry of impending resource shortfalls, and we 
understand these are three-year forward markets, so that means 
that if there is a problem four years from now, if it's not 
fixed this year, it's not going to be fixed in four years. 
These are forward contracts we are dealing with. To show you 
just how broken these markets are, despite the fact that PJM is 
telling us we are having impending shortfalls of capacity, at 
the last residual auction, the prices actually went down. And 
you don't need to be Ph.D. in economics or have some strange 
theory to let you know that scarcity pricing is not supposed to 
reflect lower prices when scarcity is eminent, right? That just 
isn't how it works.
    FERC has, I am sorry to say, been the midwife to some of 
the problems that have led to these market signals being 
warped. We got rid of the minimum offer price rule in some of 
our markets. That was a mechanism that was employed by FERC to 
ensure that resources had to bid either at their actual costs, 
as opposed to bidding in what they are able to, based upon 
subsidies. We even have increased the moral hazard of the 
entire procurement auction mechanism by an order recently 
issued that, over my serious objections, that sought to reset 
the market prices after the auction ran in order to lower the 
prices that resulted. Well, the reason why the prices go up is 
because there is scarcity of some kind, and as the old economic 
saw goes, the solution to high prices is high prices. If we 
don't allow the pricing mechanisms to work and we don't allow 
the incentives to actually--that is, the market incentives to 
drive people's action, it is impossible to rationally allocate 
capital and we will find that there are reliability failures. 
And I hope that I am proven wrong on this, right? None of us 
want to have a reliability disaster, but given the fact that we 
have put so much trust in these markets and we are giving them 
the basic job of trying to procure resources, I think it is 
very likely inevitable.
    So my time is up. Thank you very much. I look forward to 
your questions.

    Now we have Allison Clements, our other Commissioner.

   STATEMENT OF HON. ALLISON CLEMENTS, COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL 
                  ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION

    Ms. Clements. Thank you, Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member 
Barrasso, members of the Committee. I appreciate the honor to 
testify here this morning. I am honored to continue to serve at 
this critical time for our energy system. I also appreciate the 
chance to continue the dialogue with this Committee about the 
inflection point that the energy transition has created for 
that system. Our nation's grid continues to face significant 
challenges, including outdated infrastructure, a changing 
resource mix, and intensifying extreme weather events. FERC is 
tasked with striving for system affordability and reliability 
in the face of these challenges while appreciating some sober 
realities--Russia's war on Ukraine, inflation, and the evolving 
cyber and physical threat to the grid. This morning I will 
highlight a few of my own priorities related to our 
affordability and reliability mandates.
    I will start with our outstanding proposals on transmission 
planning and interconnection reform. EEI has estimated that 
U.S. utilities invested almost $28 billion in electric 
transmission last year. Customer dollars are going to be spent 
on transmission in any case. I believe it is FERC's job to 
direct that investment in a manner that provides the most 
benefits to customers at the lowest cost. Our regional planning 
proposal gives states an important seat at the table and 
requires long-term planning across a variety of potential 
scenarios in the face of uncertainty. Our generator 
interconnection proposal addresses another aspect of the 
problem--overwhelmed and broken interconnection processes 
around the country where projects face years-long delays in 
line in hopes of connecting to the grid.
    While facilitating efficient transmission planning and 
interconnection reform are cornerstones of ensuring future 
reliability, it has not been the Commission's only reliability 
focus. Since Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, FERC has made 
progress on several recommendations proposed by the North 
American Reliability Corporation and FERC staff, including the 
issuance of new cold weather reliability standards. I am also 
pleased that FERC will host its second New England Winter Gas-
Electric Forum in June to address the region's specific 
challenges. I have and will continue to push the grid 
operators, states, and stakeholders in New England to quantify 
their short- and longer-term risks using a data-driven, 
technology-neutral approach.
    Of course, no matter the region and no matter the season, 
no solution for today's reliability challenges will be complete 
without consideration of all the tools in the reliability tool 
box. We can improve the efficiency of the existing grid at 
relatively low cost using grid-enhancing technologies, and I 
hope FERC will finalize several rules that involve the use of 
those technologies. We can leverage them out of distributed 
energy resources and demand response through effective 
implementation of market rule changes and through continued 
partnership with state regulators. These initiatives, together 
with ongoing interregional transmission planning and cost 
management discussions, are meant to maintain reasonable costs 
for customers while reducing the likelihood that any single 
severe storm or other event will cause shocks to customer bills 
or power outages. We have an urgent need to move forward in 
finalizing them.
    I will end with two bright spots. Last month, under 
Chairman Phillips' leadership, FERC held an environmental 
justice and equity roundtable at the Commission. The event 
reminded me of the importance of engaging early and effectively 
with front-line and fence-line communities, not only to address 
their important concerns, but to ensure the legal durability of 
our decisions.
    Finally, I want to share a note of praise for FERC's Office 
of Public Participation. I am pleased with what OPP has 
accomplished during their short tenure so far, and I look 
forward to their continued growth.
    As always, it is my honor and privilege to serve. Thank 
you.

    The Chairman. Thank you, Commissioner.
    And now, we have Commissioner Mark Christie.

   STATEMENT OF HON. MARK C. CHRISTIE, COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL 
                  ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION

    Mr. Christie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you, 
Chairman Manchin and Ranking Member Barrasso, members of the 
Committee, it is an honor, again, to appear in front of you and 
I want to start off and just give some kudos to our Chairman, 
Chairman Phillips. I think he's done a great job in a very 
challenging situation and I enjoy having him as our Chairman.
    The one issue I want to focus on today, I think, is 
reliability, and I am really afraid to say that I think the 
United States is heading for a very catastrophic situation in 
terms of reliability. I hope it doesn't happen, but I think we 
are heading for potentially catastrophic consequences. And the 
core of the problem is actually very simple. We are retiring 
dispatchable generating resources at a pace and in an amount 
that is far too fast and far too great and it is threatening 
our ability to keep the lights on. Now, the problem is not the 
addition of wind and solar and other renewable resources. The 
problem is the subtraction of dispatchable resources such as 
coal and gas. And of course, Mr. Chairman, as you know, when a 
dispatchable coal unit is prematurely retired in West Virginia, 
it's still in rate base and the consumers still have to pay for 
it. But this is going on all over the country, in both RTO and 
non-RTO states, this almost cascading number of early 
retirements. And when I mean early retirements, I mean 
retirements when there are still many years of useful life left 
on these generating units.
    So let's look at PJM for one example, and the Chairman 
alluded to PJM. The CEO of PJM--and PJM, by the way, is the 
biggest RTO in terms of load in terms of consumers served in 
our country--so the CEO of PJM announced just a few weeks ago 
that PJM is projecting that they are going to lose 40 gigawatts 
of generating resources, 90 percent of which is dispatchable--
coal and gas, primarily. And they are going to lose these 40 
gigawatts of dispatchable resources in just the next few years. 
At the same time, and by the way, the independent market 
monitor for PJM says the actual number is not 40 gigawatts, 
it's over 50 gigawatts of prematurely retiring generating 
resources. And against this, PJM is projecting at least 13 
gigawatts of load growth. And so, even if you took every unit 
in the queue--and people who think that, well, if we just clear 
the queue, everything will be fine--no, it won't. You could 
clear the whole queue and you wouldn't be close to covering 
what PJM is projecting in terms of their lost resources.
    And as we all know, and this is a hard fact, as the 
Chairman alluded to it, the fact is most of the units that are 
in the PJM queue, almost 90 percent plus, are either wind or 
solar. So you can clear that queue, but a nameplate megawatt of 
wind or solar is simply not equal in terms of capacity value to 
a nameplate megawatt of coal or gas or nuclear. It's just not 
there. So basically, in PJM, the arithmetic doesn't work. The 
arithmetic doesn't work, and we are going to end up with more 
situations like we had last Christmas and during Winter Storm 
Elliott, when PJM came that close to having rotating outages. 
Now, the largest part of the problem in PJM, again, was the gas 
units. A lot of the independent gas units did not show up.
    So let's talk about the two reasons why these cascading 
retirements, and why we are heading for what I think is a 
potentially catastrophic situation. First, yes, market design 
is a problem. In the RTOs, particularly those with capacity 
markets, like the Eastern RTOs, market design is a big reason 
that we are seeing a lack of resources showing up and resources 
prematurely retiring. You know, these markets--and they are 
called markets, but they are not markets. They are 
administrative constructs and they always have been. They are 
called markets. They have some market characteristics, but they 
are not true markets, and particularly the capacity markets, 
which in the Eastern RTOs like PJM are the main way to get to 
resource adequacy and are increasingly just simply not working. 
So market design in the RTOs is a big problem, but I don't want 
to rule out the non-RTOs either. There are problems with 
premature retirements there too.
    The second reason, particularly, is we are not building a 
transportation capacity for gas units. Gas units, increasingly, 
are the ones that were being called upon to be the balancing 
resources when coal retires prematurely. But if you can't get 
gas to the generating units, they can't run. And one of the big 
problems, that we already know, and from Elliott and PJM, was 
that a lot of the independent gas generators that did not have 
firm supply did not have any gas supply during the storm. So 
this problem is coming. It is coming quickly. The red lights 
are flashing. And I think as a member of FERC, it is important 
for us to tell you that we see these problems coming. They are 
real. And if we don't do something about them, I am afraid that 
we are going to look at potentially catastrophic situations. 
And what we saw in Winter Storm Uri in Texas, I think, is a 
harbinger of what we are going to get because that was a supply 
problem, a supply default, and Winter Storm Elliott was the 
same way--supply did not show up when it needed to show up. And 
I think we are heading to more situations like that.
    And with that, I will be happy to answer your questions. 
And thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Christie follows:]
   GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT
    The Chairman. Thanks to all of you for your opening 
remarks. We appreciate it. Now we will start with our 
questions, and I will begin.
    First of all, we see we have a two-two split, and people 
say that we are just divided and we cannot get anything 
accomplished. It looks like you all have done fairly well 
getting things accomplished in this two-two split. Do you agree 
that FERC is not able to continue to come together or work well 
in a two-two split? There will definitely be a fifth member, 
but I am just saying that you have to do your job until that 
happens. So each one of you can comment on that, and we will 
start with Chairman Phillips.
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Chairman Manchin. Thank you for 
the question.
    I can say this--this Commission, even though we are 
divided, and there was lots of doom and gloom about our 
inability to get things done, we have not sat on our hands. We 
have kept pace with past Commissions as we have moved forward 
important, critical infrastructure projects that are needed for 
the reliability of our grid. And I can tell you this, it has 
very little to do with me, sir. I give the credit--all of the 
credit--to my colleagues. They have stepped forward to lead and 
to make sure that we don't have a situation where we cannot 
move things forward. I can't do it by myself. I give them all 
of the credit.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Mr. Danly.
    Mr. Danly. I think so far there have been no problems at 
all with the two-two split. The rate of orders has been moving 
at pace and we have had, I would say, very good collegiality 
talking about the contents of the orders over the last few 
months.
    The Chairman. You all bring a diverse amount of talent to 
it, and that is what is great to see--all this talent coming 
together for the purpose of a cause.
    Commissioner Clements.
    Ms. Clements. I think we are doing fine. I think Chairman 
Phillips is doing a great job. I think we are very busy and 
there are some really important proposals out there that we 
need to act on.
    The Chairman. Commissioner Christie.
    Mr. Christie. You know, I don't really look at it as a two-
two split. I look at four members. Now, we are all four 
lawyers. That means we have 16 different opinions on any issue.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Christie. But, you know, we only need three votes to 
get something out, and the business is getting done. The vast 
majority of our cases come under the Federal Power Act, and I 
think there is no real particular lineup on how people vote on 
Federal Power Act issues, particularly the ones that come up 
from the RTOs. So I don't think it is a two-two. I think it is 
a matter of getting to three votes on every order. And I think 
that the track record shows that, in fact, we are doing that in 
mostly every case.
    The Chairman. And you have a lot of unanimous, too, which 
really speaks volumes for all of you.
    Mr. Christie. The vast majority are unanimous, actually.
    The Chairman. Let me throw this to you, what I didn't 
understand--the PJM system, which I know, I have been in the 
PJM. I was born and raised in the PJM system, know it well. I 
have been through some of its challenges. And I am concerned, 
but you all said something--the subsidies. Every power source 
is subsidized. Coal is subsidized to a certain extent. You can 
say, well, they get this and that and credit offsets. Nuclear 
is subsidized, and wind and solar. But wind and solar is coming 
on, and when it comes on, basically, it has to go when it comes 
on. So if you are going to dispatch and basically shut 
something down in order to make capacity for the new technology 
of wind and solar, but it does not have the storage to give it 
to you when you need it, it has to give it to you when it makes 
it. Is that the problem? And you said the cost is coming on at 
zero. I know that it has come from like 16 cents a kilowatt-
hour down to five and six cents. Coal has gone up because of 
environmental concerns. I understand that and all the rest of 
them.
    I just keep saying that I know back home they want to keep 
the lights on. They want to be able to take care of their 
families and their businesses. And I looked over at what 
happened in Europe, and yesterday I had the privilege of 
talking to German military that were here giving me assessments 
on different things, but we started talking about energy. I 
said, ``tell me what happened.'' He said, ``we made a grave 
mistake--we took off our dispatchable quicker and got hooked on 
cheap Russian oil and gas.'' He said we got hooked on cheap 
Russian oil and gas. And then we thought the North Sea could 
produce all of our wind that we needed. None of that happened 
and they got in a situation. They threw caution to the wind, as 
far as oversight, on environmental oversight to keep people 
from freezing and starving. So we know the geopolitical risk 
that we are taking here, but is it because of--are we looking 
at all the costs when you do that, taking the subsidies away 
from the actual cost or basically looking at the cost 
delivered? How, I mean, I know Commissioner Danly, you said 
that, and----
    Mr. Danly. When I was speaking about the offering in at 
zero, I was specifically talking about the capacity market. I 
am not talking about the all-in cost to consumers. That is a 
matter of both the real-time energy cost they have to----
    The Chairman. But how does it come out onto the grid? How 
is it--you only have so much capacity on the grid. It is like a 
highway. You have three highways, three lanes.
    Mr. Danly. Right.
    The Chairman. And you have four lanes of traffic, you have 
a problem.
    Mr. Danly. So you rightly identify the fact that 
electricity is unique as a commodity because it has to be 
produced as it is being consumed, other than marginal, really 
unimportant to the running of the system storage capacity. And 
the more of the dispatchable resources that are displaced 
because they become economically unviable, the harder it is to 
rely upon intermittents to keep the system running. It is just 
a matter----
    The Chairman. Dispatchable, as you talked about, so for 
everybody, it is 24/7. It is your baseload.
    Mr. Danly. It is not only baseload. This would also include 
things like gas plants, which can be, in the moment of 
shortfall, right, as soon as load comes on----
    The Chairman. Right.
    Mr. Danly. Then you have to immediately meet the load with 
new generation, and if there is a drop-off, then you have to 
immediately make up the shortfall. And so, natural gas has 
been, we have moved to, over the last 20 years----
    The Chairman. But you are saying that basically those that 
are non-dispatchable, that are not 24/7 baseload, they are 
basically, because of pricing pushing off and early retirements 
as I think----
    Mr. Danly. Yes.
    The Chairman. As Chairman Christie said, and we see that 
happening.
    Mr. Danly. Yes.
    The Chairman. Pushing off quicker than we have the ability 
to replace so we are going to be in a very unreliable 
situation, is what you are saying?
    Mr. Danly. That is right.
    The Chairman. Your turn.
    Senator Barrasso. Thanks, Mr. Chair.
    Well, let me stick with you, Commissioner Danly. We have 
just heard about the potential for catastrophic problems with 
the grid. You mentioned it, as did Commissioner Christie. In 
your opening statement you said, ``As an engineering matter 
there is no substitute for reliable, dispatchable generation.'' 
You said, ``Intermittent renewable resources like wind and 
solar are simply incapable by themselves of ensuring the 
stability of the bulk electric system.'' Commissioner Christie 
said, ``The red lights are flashing. Problems are coming. The 
problem generally is not the addition of intermittent 
resources, primarily wind and solar, but the far too rapid 
subtraction of dispatchable resources, especially coal and 
gas.''
    So please briefly explain why natural gas, nuclear, coal, 
and hydropower plants are absolutely necessary to keep the grid 
stable.
    Mr. Danly. So Senator, when you are trying to run an 
electric system stably, there are certain attributes, and to 
keep it brief, I am not going to get into VARs and all the 
complexities of the engineering, but there are basic attributes 
that large generators that have large spinning mass have. When 
you, as I just alluded, you have to produce the electricity at 
the same time it is consumed, when the load changes, the 
frequency and the voltage change and the large spinning mass of 
bigger generators, not intermittents, allow the system to ride 
through more stably than if you were relying wholly on 
inverter-based resources like wind and solar. So it is the 
basic attributes of those assets.
    Senator Barrasso. Commissioner Christie, President Biden is 
determined to electrify everything, in my opinion, no matter 
what the cost, no matter what the consequences are on the 
American people. What do you think the cost and consequences 
are going to be of forced electrification on President Biden's 
timeline?
    Mr. Christie. Well, I don't know about the timeline, but 
whenever you, you know, as you increase electrification, let's 
say of the transportation sector or the home heating sector or 
the other uses where, right now, maybe natural gas is being 
used, obviously, you increase load, you increase demand. And 
just under supply and demand, as you increase demand, you have 
to keep pace on supply. And this is where, I think, we are 
looking at potentially catastrophic consequences because if the 
demand curve is just going up exponentially, which it would do 
if you, you know, with electrifying the transportation sector 
really quickly. But at the same time, the supply curve is going 
down with the dispatchable resources that you need to meet the 
demand, you don't, I mean, again, the arithmetic doesn't work. 
And that's what the PJM situation is really showing, is that 
when you look at all the gigawatts of resources, dispatchable 
resources are going to be prematurely retiring at the same time 
load is going up. The numbers just don't balance.
    Senator Barrasso. Commissioner Danly, the Energy 
Information Administration recently released their figures, 
showing, and I quote, ``The least U.S. interstate natural gas 
pipeline capacity on record was added in 2022.'' So in your 
view, how did the Commission's decisions in 2021 and 2022 
contribute to this failure?
    Mr. Danly. So the Commission bears virtually all the 
responsibility for this. We are absolutely the ones who caused 
this. I hate to say I told you so, but a year ago, we had a 
hearing on some of the decisions that FERC had made and the 
promulgations of the Commission. And at the time, I said that 
the slow-processing of the Section 7 applications, that is for 
interstate natural gas pipelines, and the regulatory 
uncertainty that was going to be created by standardless 
issuances in which the pipeline applicants had to guess what 
kind of mitigation would be good enough to pass muster under a 
sort of black-box review by the Commission--I said that was 
going to have a chilling effect on investment, that it was 
going to be impossible to rationally allocate capital. And we 
have seen the results of those policies.
    And we still have a cloud, even now, because I have 
repeatedly called on the Commission--my colleagues--to close 
those dockets. I really think that as long as those things 
remain open, we are going to have continued regulatory 
uncertainty that is going to chill investment.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, Commissioner Clements, what do you 
think about that?
    Ms. Clements. I think the Commission has taken its case-by-
case approach to both Section 7 pipelines and Section 3 LNG 
facility applications. And in each case, there is a decision 
made. There has to be a decision made to balance between speed 
and checking all and doing the sufficient analysis so that if a 
case goes to court, it withstands review. And that is the 
approach that I have brought to all of these dockets.
    Senator Barrasso. Final question, for the Chairman. 
Chairman Phillips, today, wind and solar developers are 
accounting for the vast majority of the applications to connect 
new electric generation facilities into the grid. Grid 
operators can't depend on wind turbines and solar panels to 
supply power whenever the demand is there. In contrast, natural 
gas generators can quickly supply or reduce power to the grid. 
To me, that means natural gas generators help balance the 
weather-dependent resources like wind and solar. Natural gas 
provides the backup support that wind and solar need.
    So is it fair to say that delaying necessary natural gas 
pipelines in infrastructure undermines efforts to allow the 
additional wind and solar facilities to be connected to the 
grid?
    Mr. Phillips. Yes, Senator. I believe that is absolutely 
true. My colleagues have talked about it already a little bit. 
Actually, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, 
they warned us that we are already seeing potential impacts to 
reliability on the grid. You know, I think it is also important 
that, as Chairman, you know, we are clear that we are resource-
neutral. We want to advance and open the markets to all 
resources. And so, transmission reform is another important 
factor when it comes to the question.
    Senator Barrasso. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Cantwell.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you to you and Ranking Member Barrasso for this 
important hearing. FERC plays a critical role in ensuring all 
Americans pay just and reasonable rates for their electric, 
their energy supplies. And this role becomes even more 
important, in my opinion, during a time of transition. No more 
than today, as hundreds of billions of dollars are being 
invested to diversify and decarbonize the energy mix, digitize 
the grid, and accommodate more intermittent supply and energy 
options. And with climate change driving more frequent and 
severe weather events, like hurricanes, wildfires, ice storms, 
and flooding, it is abundantly clear that we need to move to an 
improved, reliable, and resilient electric grid. Many of my 
colleagues here represented 1.5 million customers who lost 
power last December to the Winter Storm Elliott. In fact, over 
80 percent of the major outages over the past two decades were 
attributed to weather events. Notably, the extreme weather-
caused outages shot up roughly 78 percent over the last decade.
    So my point in stating that is that I want a full and 
functioning FERC. I want you to pay attention to this as we go 
into the diversification that I think we need to do because our 
grid is at peril. We have lots of policy ideas that certainly 
support the Chairman's efforts in the past on Middle Mile, on 
fiber, and I think that his state has led on some of those 
issues. But I wanted to, you know, in the wake of the Enron 
crisis, we had to make sure that--actually then-Chairman 
Wellinghoff from Nevada did a really great job in implementing 
the authority we gave to FERC to really be a policeman on the 
beat. Since that date, there have been over 130 settlement 
agreements, assessments of over $800 million in civil 
penalties, and disgorgement of another $500 million in illegal 
profits. So I just want to make sure that--I joined my 
colleague again from Nevada on making sure that we have tough 
enforcement here on traders who continually manipulate the 
market. This is crazy that they go from one company to the next 
and just set up the same schemes.
    So I would like to hear from the Commissioners whether you 
believe that energy markets have to be free of manipulation. 
You know, this confusion, well, can you have just and 
reasonable rates and manipulation? I will be clear--the answer, 
in my opinion, is no, you can't have manipulation if you are 
going to have just and reasonable rates. And should those 
gains, misgotten gains, be properly returned to the injured 
parties and to consumers?
    So if I could hear views on that quickly. And yes, you 
know, whatever your answers are. Yes, go ahead.
    Mr. Christie. Yes, they should be returned to the 
consumers, and I also think FERC would benefit from the 
authority. I think I read where you had a bill to give FERC the 
authority to delicense or revoke the ability of traders who 
manipulate the market to continue doing that. I don't think we 
have that authority now, and I think it would be a good 
authority to have.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you. That is Senator Cortez Masto--
--
    Mr. Christie. I am sorry, Senator.
    Senator Cantwell. Well, I joined her on that bill.
    Mr. Christie. All right.
    Senator Cantwell. It is so important, but I am bringing it 
up.
    Commissioner Clements.
    Ms. Clements. I agree completely with Commissioner 
Christie.
    Mr. Danly. I just delivered a homily on market signals, so 
of course, I think markets should be free of manipulation and 
yes, we should return the ill-gotten gains, if they are found 
to be, to the ratepayers.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Mr. Phillips. You are seeing, yet again, another unanimous 
decision right here in front of you.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Cantwell. Okay.
    Mr. Phillips. I agree.
    Senator Cantwell. Well, I think this is, as we face tight 
markets and changes, look, it is always surprising. These are 
not--well, the traders who manipulate these schemes, as we have 
seen, actually over at CFTC too, but you know, FERC, again, 
when you play this role of just and reasonable rates, having an 
anti-manipulation authority that the Commission aggressively 
enforces, I think, is very critical. And so, I am glad to hear 
you endorse the Cortez Masto/Cantwell bill on this as well.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Now we have Senator Lee.
    Senator Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to each of you 
for your service and for being here today.
    Commissioner Christie, I would like to start with you, if 
that's all right?
    I want to talk about permitting reform. This is a topic 
that is finally becoming sexy--popular to people on both sides 
of the aisle, and not a moment too soon. It is getting some 
traction, and with good reason. It is encouraging that there is 
growing consensus that we need to update our regulations so we 
can produce more energy in America, rely less on other 
countries that have lower environmental standards than we do, 
and also be in a position to supply more natural gas to other 
countries that rely on much dirtier forms of electric power 
generation. But unfortunately, some harmful ideas have made 
their way into the mix. And some of those ideas would increase 
consumer costs without providing any benefits.
    Now, one of those ideas involves spreading the cost of 
large transmission lines among and between a larger group of 
electricity ratepayers--of customers. This idea, according to 
those proposing it, is necessary because it would make it 
easier for them to build large, long-distance lines to deliver 
wind and solar power to places like California that suffer 
frequent power shortages directly attributable to their short-
sighted, aggressive, radical climate-change policies. Now, in 
my opinion, it is simply not fair to force ratepayers in states 
like Utah or Idaho or Wyoming to pay for and otherwise shoulder 
the burden associated with the costs of the California and 
Oregon climate policies. So Commissioner, should Congress be in 
the position of socializing the costs of large transmission 
lines to customers who will never benefit from those lines?
    Mr. Christie. We will focus on the transmission instead of 
the permitting. I, first of all, think they are separate 
issues. I think permitting is a legal authority to move forward 
with construction, and we have huge problems with court reviews 
on that, as we all know. On transmission, I think that a 
transmission line that would not be built but for the public 
policies of a state or states, the cost should be allocated to 
the state or states that want to move forward with the public 
policy projects.
    There are three, really three boxes of projects of 
transmission. The first are reliability projects. And I think 
everybody agrees reliability projects need to be built, 
absolutely. Economic projects are where you solve more 
congestion costs with a transmission line and everybody 
generally agrees you need to build those. The public policy-
driven projects are projects that are built, but would not be 
built but for--and they are primarily state policies. And so, 
if the state policies are driving the projects, and a classic 
example is New Jersey's offshore wind, which is driven purely 
by New Jersey's policies, then I think most people would say 
that you should not allocate the cost of New Jersey's policy-
driven projects to, for example, in PJM, to consumers in West 
Virginia. And that is the fundamental principle of let the 
states that want the policy-driven projects allocate the costs 
among themselves.
    Senator Lee. Thank you. That is helpful.
    Commissioner Danly, let's turn to you. As you are well 
aware, FERC has a pretty well-defined mission, and it is a 
mission that the Supreme Court described back in 1976 as 
involving a job to ``encourage the orderly development of 
plentiful supplies of electricity and natural gas at just and 
reasonable rates.'' I have noticed that, in recent years, in 
the last two, two-and-a-half years in particular, we have seen 
the Commission starting to stray from that mission. And while I 
am pleased that there has been some progress over the last few 
months toward reversing that disturbing trend, I remain very 
concerned about the lingering uncertainty that is there, 
uncertainty that has been contributed to by past FERC 
decisions, especially those in the last two years, that have a 
tendency to stifle investment in natural gas pipelines and 
electricity transmission projects.
    What should FERC be doing, in your view, to provide more 
certainty to project investors making risk assessments?
    Mr. Danly. Senator, you are quite correct to be concerned 
about the regulatory uncertainty. FERC is, at its core, a rate-
making agency, and what we should do is make our rate decisions 
as clear as possible. When tariffs are approved, we need to 
enforce the terms of the tariff. One of the worst things that 
the Commission does is constantly grant the legal retroactive 
waivers to do things like jump queue positions or have 
deadlines that are relied upon to manage queue processing. We 
need to have clear and firm rules, and we need to apply them, 
and we need to set the circumstances of clarity and regulatory 
certainty that allow rational allocation of capital because the 
risk premiums now, given the uncertainty regulatorily are so 
great, that they are stultifying investment in critical 
infrastructure.
    Senator Lee. I have additional questions. We have a lot of 
members here and so I am not going to take more time. As my 
time is expired, I will submit those for the record.
    Thanks so much for being here.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Heinrich.
    Senator Heinrich. Chairman, I want to start just by saying, 
as an engineering matter, that we are no longer dependent on 
spinning mass to regulate frequency or voltage. You can 
accomplish that with state-of-the-art inverters. That is 
actually articulated in IEEE 1541, and we have been doing it in 
Hawaii for years.
    I want to get to the issue of federal rights of first 
refusal. So Commissioners, I am highly concerned that the 
FERC's proposed plan to reinstate additional federal rights of 
first refusals for regionally planned transmission facilities 
is fundamentally anti-competitive and will hinder new 
transmission lines from being built. I don't ask that you take 
my word for that. The Department of Justice and the Federal 
Trade Commission had equally strenuous opinions to say about 
this. So I just wanted to ask you, Chairman Phillips, is the 
Commission still considering reinstatement of federal rights of 
first refusals?
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Senator.
    That is one aspect that is in our proposed rule on regional 
transmission planning. We propose that we reinstate the ROFR in 
very limited circumstances, for example, where there is joint 
ownership. But to be clear, we have had many comments on the 
record. We are reviewing those comments and I am open to 
changes to the proposed rule.
    Senator Heinrich. I would just urge you to look very 
closely at that policy because I think we obviously have a 
transmission issue. You have articulated that well and we do 
not want to create a situation where we are making that even 
harder to fix.
    The transmission and cost allocation NOPR does not propose 
changes to the existing interregional transmission coordination 
and the cost allocation requirements in Order No. 1000. I think 
that interregional progress is really key to solving these 
transmission issues. So two questions, Chairman. Does the 
Commission intend to undertake such action on interregional 
planning and cost allocation?
    Mr. Phillips. Yes, absolutely. I have talked about 
interregional transmission capability since I joined the 
Commission. You don't have to look any further than recent 
extreme weather events to see how critical and important they 
can be to maintaining the reliability of the grid. It is my 
hope that in the very near-term, we can take up a proposal on 
interregional.
    You mentioned cost. I don't want to take away from your 
time. I have a lot to say on that issue.
    Senator Heinrich. Go ahead.
    Mr. Phillips. Well, we had a forum last fall on cost 
containment. And to be clear, this is something that I believe 
is critically important. When you talk about affordability, it 
is something that--we are still struggling with the last 
recession that we had, the last economic crisis. People are 
hurting still. So when there is just a slight uptick in cost on 
energy bills, people feel it, people like where I am from. And 
so, I take this very seriously. This is top-of-mind for me.
    Senator Heinrich. Yes, I think one of the big issues is 
cost allocation, right? How do you do that fairly, and a key 
obstacle to planning some of those interregional transmission 
lines is that individual states and RTOs are using different 
planning models. So you get in sort of a food fight when it 
comes to cost allocation. So on that point, is FERC considering 
standardizing planning methodologies for transmission so that 
we can negotiate some of those food fights and agree to one set 
of rules to the road?
    Mr. Phillips. Cost allocation is certainly on the table. It 
is a big part of why we are doing our regional planning. We 
have a proposal that would bring states more into that process. 
I think there are many different ways you can do it, you know, 
there is the--you can do it as an ex ante approach, you can 
have a state agreement approach, which is something that we 
have approved in the past. I know my colleagues feel very 
strongly about this. We have received comments. These are all 
important reforms that we are considering.
    Senator Heinrich. I have about 50 seconds left, so I am 
going to throw you a more open-ended question, which is just 
the role of reconductoring in transmission. Obviously, you 
know, when you reconductor, you can dramatically increase 
throughput. You can, you know, line losses are reduced. You can 
improve the economics, and if you can pass those along to 
customers, then you can really help them with their economic 
challenges, and grid-enhancing technologies, also, things like 
power flow controls and dynamic line rating have huge potential 
to help relieve some of this transmission congestion while you 
do the hard work of getting transmission built across the 
country.
    So just talk about those things, how FERC is thinking about 
them as you look at the overall needs to increase transmission 
planning.
    Mr. Phillips. Senator, you are preaching to the choir when 
you talk about grid-enhancing technologies. Advanced 
reconductoring--I think that these types of tools, they have to 
be a part of our planning process. It addresses every single 
point that I raise--reliability, affordability, and 
sustainability. Dynamic line ratings----
    Senator Heinrich. And not across purposes, it actually 
aligns those things.
    Mr. Phillips. Absolutely. Thank you.
    I mean, and when you talk about dynamic line ratings, we 
have a proposal, we have a proceeding that is ongoing on that. 
Ambient adjusted line ratings, we have accepted six compliance 
filings already. Our regions are implementing--our utilities 
are implementing ambient. So this is something that I take very 
seriously. It is top-of-mind for me.
    Senator Heinrich. Thank you all.
    Thanks, Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    And speaking about transmission, I will say this, just for 
the record--that was our greatest challenge we had in 
negotiating our permitting bill. It really was. It is something 
that we have to overcome, but it was taken to note that if a 
state, such as mine, who is an exporter of power, and a power 
line has to come through to service the East Coast/West Coast 
whatever in the PJM system, there should not be any cost 
allocations to a state that is a net exporter. We thought we 
worked through all that, but that is one of the greatest 
challenges. You all are going to be very much involved in this 
whole process as we go through this permitting.
    The House gave us a piece of legislation with no 
transmission in it. No bill is going to happen without 
transmission--same as pipelines, everything. It is all needed. 
So we know how critical this is and we really appreciate your 
input. And we are looking forward to your expertise on this.
    With that, we have Senator Cassidy.
    Senator Cassidy. Hey, folks. I always think about this 
testimony throughout the year. It is always very thought 
provoking. Thank you. Partly because you provoke each other. 
That is also a little bit amusing.
    Chairman Phillips, I am told that the queue for an LNG 
export plant, that if somebody files, the queue is based upon 
the time stamp of the filing, even if none of their financing 
is put together, and that there are other projects for which 
the financing is fully mature and it could launch, but it is 
stuck behind. Seems less than optimal to me. One, is it true, 
and two, is it optimal, or three, if not optimal, what should 
we do?
    Mr. Phillips. I think the best thing that we can do----
    Senator Cassidy. Is it true?
    Mr. Phillips. I am going to have to look into that. I am 
not sure exactly about, you know, what you raise with the time 
stamp and when the process, the clock starts.
    Can I just say this real quick?
    The best thing that we can do is to make sure that we 
faithfully execute our statutory obligations, and to be clear, 
since I have taken over as Chairman, we have done everything we 
can to streamline our internal review processes. We have 
approved, when you talk about BCF, as much this year as we have 
to the last two years combined.
    Senator Cassidy. Okay, thank you.
    Mr. Christie, okay, a bunch of solar people in my office 
yesterday and they are telling me how in New Orleans, which 
suffered after the storm with great power outages, that you 
could set up solar panels, rooftop solar with a big battery 
there, and that would store the energy so that if the power 
lines go down, it could feed back in. That almost seems like 
that would be, I could ask several of you this question, but it 
almost seems like that could be the sort of baseload that would 
be available should the other renewables at any given time not 
successfully put forward adequate power. Now, all I know is 
what I am told. So I am kind of sending it to you because I 
always like your comments. Is that pie in the sky, or could 
that be feasible for a city of roughly 350,000 people?
    Mr. Christie. Well, it would work for about four hours 
because that is about the length of the battery. We don't have 
long-duration storage on an industrial scale that could run for 
a week and inject thousands of megawatts.
    Senator Cassidy. Now, if we are talking about just peaking, 
for example, in the afternoon we all know we are going to need 
more because in Louisiana you run the air conditioner in the 
afternoon, or at least you run it more. You know what I am 
saying? Would that serve as the peaking, if not the wholesale? 
Because when a hurricane hits, as we all know, there are a lot 
of problems.
    Mr. Christie. No, it absolutely is a peaking resource, and 
particularly on a late summer afternoon in Louisiana when it is 
really hot and is sunny, the solar is generating at 100 percent 
capacity and it is wonderful. What you really need, to keep the 
grid going though, you have to have a balanced portfolio, and 
you have to have enough different resources that can run at 
every second of every hour of every day because the grid has to 
be balanced every second of every hour of every day.
    So while you have some resources that are great for 
peaking, but you need other resources that can run on a 
continuous basis for literally----
    Senator Cassidy. I accept that. I am not arguing with that.
    Mr. Christie. Right.
    Senator Cassidy. Mr. Danly, there is something in your 
testimony that seemed quite pregnant with meaning but I did not 
quite understand. Okay, on the bottom of page one going into 
page two, ``FERC has directly interfered with price formation 
by allowing one of our wholesale markets to change the rules of 
its procurement auction after the auction had run in order to 
lower the resulting price.''
    Can you elaborate on that, and give specific detail?
    Mr. Danly. Yes, Senator. I am sorry that was not clear 
enough.
    We had a recent order that was issued, and we have to be a 
little bit careful because this is still pending before the 
Commission, but I can always talk about what the order said. It 
allowed for PJM to reset the auction results because there was 
an idiosyncratically high price that came out of one of the 
areas within the market. And it is my contention in my 
testimony that if we are going to rely upon procurement 
auctions--that is, capacity auctions--to ensure resource 
adequacy, then we cannot rerun auctions because the moral 
hazard that attends changing the rules after the fact means 
that nobody in future auctions will believe that the offers 
they make into it will actually be honored, and they will be 
unable to price the risk that is necessary in formulating the 
correct offers. It will fundamentally undermine the mechanisms 
that we are relying on.
    Senator Cassidy. Okay.
    So Mr. Phillips, how would you respond to that? Because, 
frankly, it seems pretty convincing to me.
    Mr. Phillips. My colleague talked about an idiosyncratic 
anomaly. I call that an error. There was an error in the 
auction. PJM----
    Senator Cassidy. But these are major players, right? This 
is not like Bill Cassidy goes to the mall one day and pays, you 
know, three times as much as he should for an iPod, iPad or 
whatever.
    Mr. Phillips. This was way more significant than that. We 
are talking----
    Senator Cassidy. But I mean, these were mature, 
sophisticated bidders. So I am a little skeptical that they 
would make a mistake. I'd just say that.
    Mr. Phillips. PJM, the grid operator, the independent 
market monitor, the states, they all agreed that this was an 
error to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars impacting 
one of the poorest areas in all----
    Senator Cassidy. So can I ask Mr. Danly how would you 
respond to that, and then I am out of time. If I can just ask.
    Mr. Danly. It is not an error to have high prices at times 
of scarcity. That is not a bug of a market. That is what 
markets are for. And if what we keep doing is ex post facto 
remedies to--it's not an error, it is a scarcity signal. If we 
make ex post facto corrections to fix non-errors--that is to 
say, actual signs of scarcity--the markets will fail.
    Senator Cassidy. I am out of time unless the Chairman 
indulges and wishes to pursue this himself, but thank you all 
very much.
    The Chairman. We will get right back to it.
    Senator Cortez Masto.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. I am going to defer to my 
colleague to the left, Senator King, who has an appointment he 
has to get to.
    Senator King. Sitting next to you----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator King. Rather than implying an ideological--I do 
think it is charming that my friend from Louisiana remembers 
iPods. That was nice that you did that.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator King. Mr. Chairman, when we are talking about 
rebuilding the grid, I hope that the FERC will encourage 
reconductoring and technological smart-grid enhancements before 
having to go to new rights-of-way, and I know that is going to 
be necessary, but it seems to me that the structure should be 
to start with the cheaper stuff first before we go to the total 
expansion. Is that a sensible way to proceed?
    Mr. Phillips. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes, sir. I believe 
that grid-enhancing technologies like advanced reconductoring, 
dynamic line ratings, ambient adjusted line rating, these are 
things that are essential to planning for our future.
    Senator King. Is there a way that you can enforce that? In 
other words, if an applicant comes forward with a proposal for 
a new right-of-way, you can say, no, wait a minute, have you 
done these other less expensive and less intrusive steps first?
    Mr. Phillips. We are considering proposals, just like the 
one you mentioned, Senator, in our regional transmission 
planning proceeding. I absolutely agree, this is something that 
we should discuss, and I am open to it.
    Senator King. I want to move to a question that really 
isn't strictly a FERC question, but it is certainly involved in 
this area, and that is the interconnection queue at the RTOs. I 
may be the only Senator ever stuck in an RTO queue for a 
generating plant. Although, at the time, it was a matter of 
months. Now, we are talking about years. In fact, I think last 
year the estimate was five years. Mr. Chairman, we are talking 
about permitting reform and speeding things up. This is a 
serious bottleneck. How do we address it?
    To any of you, but I will start with you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Senator.
    There are several different proposals that we have in our 
interconnection queue reform NOPR. What we have now is a system 
where it is a serial approach where it is first come, first 
served. What we have proposed is that we move to a cluster 
approach, where it is first ready, first served. This has been 
used in other parts of the country. I think there is a real 
potential that this can help unlock some of the bottlenecks 
that we have seen.
    Senator King. Do you have authority to impose this kind of 
system or is this just ``Mother, may I'' to the RTOs?
    Mr. Phillips. For the RTOs and the regulated utilities, we 
have authority, yes, sir.
    Senator King. I hope that is something that will be 
acknowledged and taken seriously because, again, we can work 
very hard here on permitting reform to shorten the term, but if 
you then have to tack on five years at the end because of this 
interconnection issue, that defeats the whole purpose. We are 
in a race against time here, and that is incredibly important.
    Another question, and any of you please jump in if you have 
further thoughts. Are you satisfied with the cyber standards of 
the utilities? Are you satisfied that they are taking the 
requisite actions in order to protect, because clearly, in a 
conflict, I think GPS will be the first to go and probably the 
electric system will be the second level of target. Are you 
satisfied with where the industry is?
    Mr. Phillips. I give our grade on cybersecurity right now 
an incomplete. I think we still have work to do. Our 
cybersecurity standards, they are floor. They provide, I 
believe, some of the most, best practices. You know, we have a 
two-pronged approach, just to be clear, when it comes to 
cybersecurity. We have mandatory reliability standards and we 
also work with states. We work with utilities. We have audits. 
We have tabletop exercises. It is, I believe, the number one 
priority for us to secure the cyber and physical security of 
our grid.
    Senator King. The thing that I didn't hear when you listed 
all those things, I am all for standards, but you know, 
President Reagan said trust, but verify. And I want to know 
what is being done for verification. I remember having a 
hearing several years ago with NERC and I said, do you pen test 
or red team your utilities? And the answer was no. And I was 
shocked at that. Is that, has that changed, do you know? Are 
the utilities hiring hackers for hire to demonstrate whether or 
not they are secure? Because you can meet all the standards, 
and there is nothing like a skull and crossbones coming up on 
the CEO's desktop to remind him or her that they are not 
actually secure.
    Ms. Clements, do you think, is there pen testing going on 
and red teaming?
    Ms. Clements. My understanding is that yes, there are 
various types of that happening both via, you know, with 
Commission staff support, with FERC staff support, as well as 
outside of that. I am encouraged by the progress that 
government agencies have been making, working together as well 
as working with private industry related to chasing after this 
evolving threat. I think our standards are good foundational 
safeguards.
    Senator King. And I don't want to sound like I am picking 
on the utilities because actually I think they may be among the 
most secure of our critical infrastructure compared with water 
systems, for example, natural gas pipelines, those other areas. 
But that doesn't mean we don't have to be extremely diligent 
because of the magnitude of this threat.
    Thank you all very much. Thanks for the work that you are 
doing. Work on those queues at the RTOs, will you?
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to all of 
the witnesses for being here.
    Chairman Phillips, let me start with you, and start in my 
home state of Missouri and St. Louis. The Spire Pipeline in St. 
Louis, as you probably know, has had a long and somewhat 
unhappy saga until recently. Finally, in December of this past 
year, the Commission gave the pipeline a certificate to 
operate. I am asking about it because, as I hope you know, 
residents of the St. Louis area have been repeatedly told that 
their gas bills would rise in a very significant way if the 
pipeline was not able to operate. Can you give me some 
assurance that the Spire Pipeline in St. Louis will continue to 
be authorized for the foreseeable future?
    Mr. Phillips. Senator, as you know, we handle pipeline 
certifications on a case-by-case basis. We have a public 
interest obligation determination to be made. We take them as 
they come. My understanding is that--I will double-check to 
make sure with my staff to see what the status is of Spire, in 
particular, but that is the way we approach pipelines. And I 
support that case-by-case approach.
    Senator Hawley. Okay, good. Well, if you could get back to 
me that would helpful. I want to make sure that this pipeline, 
which is now FERC-approved, continues to operate and that we 
don't see major disruptions in service for the residents of the 
St. Louis region.
    Let me ask you about rural co-ops. My state is a majority 
rural state. Our rural electric co-ops are a hugely important 
part of our energy grid in the state of Missouri. They have 
been facing major supply chain issues--in particular, the 
purchasing of new transformers. Tell me what you are doing to 
help keep prices down for rural electric co-ops.
    Mr. Phillips. Again, we have a number of reforms that we 
are moving forward right now. A huge part--and I think 
affordability is addressed in some of our reforms right now and 
it will benefit the country. The more resources that we can 
bring on, I believe, can help in the long-term lower prices for 
consumers.
    Senator Hawley. Great. Well, I want to make sure that we 
keep the price of electricity affordable, and again, especially 
in our rural areas in the state, especially working with rural 
electric co-ops. That is a huge priority. I look forward to 
working with you on that.
    Let me turn to Commissioner Clements. Let me ask you--some 
emails disclosed last year via a FOIA request showed that you 
briefed a funders-only session at a left-leaning grantmaking 
foundation called the Energy Foundation about FERC 2022 
priorities. Who were the donors who attended that session?
    Ms. Clements. There was not fundraising in the meeting you 
ask about. It was a convening of foundation staff from across 
the country and I was having a very straightforward, above-the-
board conversation about 2022 priorities. Subject to my ethics 
agreement and any ex parte restrictions, I have an open-door 
policy. So I meet with all kinds of stakeholders. I have 
actually never said no to a meeting between either my staff 
taking it or myself.
    Senator Hawley. Wait a minute. You said it was staff? The 
FOIA information says it was advertised as a funders-only 
session, meaning donors.
    Ms. Clements. I am not sure. It was not an advertised 
thing. There are foundations that work together.
    Senator Hawley. It was briefed as a funders-only session, 
meaning that there were donors there. So who were the donors?
    Ms. Clements. I think it is important to understand that my 
role is to engage with these stakeholders. When I was invited 
to present to a group of foundation staff, just like when I am 
invited to present to the board of----
    Senator Hawley. I don't understand, you keep using the word 
staff. The information says there were funders present. There 
were donors. I want to know who the donors are. Who were the 
donors? Can you get me a list?
    Ms. Clements. I would be happy to.
    Senator Hawley. Good.
    Ms. Clements. I don't remember specifically, but I would be 
happy to.
    Senator Hawley. Good. Was there money raised at the event 
that you spoke at?
    Ms. Clements. No.
    Senator Hawley. What were the FERC 2022 priorities that you 
spoke with this donor group about?
    Ms. Clements. I gave my standard speech that I give when I 
speak to any convening of stakeholders who participate in the 
sector----
    Senator Hawley. You have used stakeholders now several 
times. Does that include industry donors? Is that a definition 
of stakeholder now--major donors?
    Ms. Clements. I think----
    Senator Hawley. Do you think it's appropriate that you 
would be giving closed-door briefings to donors?
    Ms. Clements. No, and I didn't do that, sir.
    Senator Hawley. What do you mean you didn't do it? The 
information says that it was a funders event. It was a funders-
only session at a foundation that raises money from donors.
    Ms. Clements. I provide my stump speech on my own FERC 
priorities to many different kinds of groups.
    Senator Hawley. Donors?
    Ms. Clements. Any convening. Some of them might be donors 
in any capacity. Certainly, I----
    Senator Hawley. Did any of those donors who were present 
that day have a financial interest in the energy industry?
    Ms. Clements. Almost everyone I speak to has a financial 
interest in the energy industry.
    Senator Hawley. Oh, wow. Okay, so this is a normal practice 
of yours to speak to groups that have financial interests in 
your industry?
    Ms. Clements. So when I go and I talk to the board of EPSA 
or the EEI CEOs or the Interstate Pipeline member companies, 
all of whom I have spent time with, the idea is that, subject 
to ethical responsibilities and also my ex parte restrictions, 
I engage with them. I tell them my priorities. I get their----
    Senator Hawley. Do you think it is appropriate--my time is 
running out here--do you think it is appropriate to speak to 
advocacy groups at a donors-only session? Do you think that is 
appropriate?
    Ms. Clements. I think it is appropriate to speak with 
foundations who are interested in the energy----
    Senator Hawley. To their donor sessions? Wow. Wow. I have 
to say, I think that is pretty problematic. I would like a list 
of the donors. I would like to know who was there. I am 
concerned about this, what you have now described as a 
practice--pattern and practice of speaking to donor groups that 
have financial interests in the industry you are regulating. I 
think that's a big problem. If that is not currently foreclosed 
by law, we ought to foreclose it, Mr. Chairman, but you said 
that you do this on a regular basis.
    We will probably follow up. I think I am probably going to 
need to see a list of all the groups you have spoken to. I am 
going to want to know the donors that you have spoken to. I am 
extremely, extremely disturbed by what you have just told me at 
a time when we have major ethics issues, you know, we have 
Members of Congress buying and selling stock based on 
information that only they are privy to. We have members of the 
executive branch who are buying and selling stock in industries 
that they regulate and now we have you speaking to donors in 
industries that you regulate.
    The Chairman. Senator, thank you.
    Senator Hawley. That is a problem.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Hawley. That is a problem, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Cortez Masto.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    Other than Ms. Clements, does anybody else speak to groups 
that you regulate? I am curious, any of the other 
commissioners?
    Mr. Phillips.
    Mr. Phillips. We speak to regulated groups, yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Mr. Danly.
    Mr. Danly. Yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Mr. Christie.
    Mr. Christie. Yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    So let me move on to Senator Cantwell. I appreciate her 
bringing this up, and I appreciate all of you agreeing to 
support the Energy Consumer Protection Act because I do think 
it is important to provide FERC with additional authority to go 
after traders that repeatedly manipulate electricity and 
natural gas markets. So thank you. And I invite my colleagues 
to join me on that legislation.
    Mr. Phillips and Commissioner Clements, let me talk to you 
a little bit about the extreme weather that we are seeing in 
the West. I know both of you have written testimony today that 
references the unprecedented challenges that our nation's 
electric system is facing from extreme weather. This has also 
been underscored by multiple North American Electric 
Reliability Corporation assessments over the years, which have 
pointed to the stress, really, that electric power systems in 
western states are under due to wildfires, persistent drought, 
and heat waves.
    Chair Phillips, you referenced the February approval of a 
series of winter preparedness measures filed by the North 
American Electric Reliability Corporation, and Commissioner 
Clements, you touched on recent workshops and conferences to 
better coordinate and prepare for extreme weather.
    Chairman Phillips, can you expand on these efforts that 
FERC is taking to develop a more hardened, resilient grid, 
particularly as we see this extreme weather happening in the 
West?
    Mr. Phillips. Absolutely, Senator.
    After the Winter Storm Elliott that happened in December, 
FERC requested that NERC do an inquiry into the impacts of the 
storm and to provide additional recommendations that we can 
implement. That inquiry is ongoing. We expect it this summer. 
It involves an even greater amount of operators than Winter 
Storm Uri. So it has taken a bit of time for us to get that, 
but we look forward to receiving those recommendations in 
addition to the--to talk a little bit more about the 
reliability standards and the measures that we approved 
recently in February, I mean, this requires our grid operators, 
our generators to actually have a plan. It addresses things 
like, you know, freezing preparedness. These are the types of 
things that were in play for Winter Storm Uri and other extreme 
weather.
    But to be clear, we have seen what used to be one-in-10-
year or one-in-100-year events that seem to be happening almost 
every other year. We have to be able to plan our system in a 
way that is prepared to keep the lights on in these extreme 
events.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. I appreciate that.
    And I know I don't have much time. Let me jump to this. I 
understand, and first of all, let me just thank Commissioners 
Clements and Christie. I understand you were visiting my 
state--northern Nevada--last month to meet with some of our 
state regulators and stakeholders to discuss the western energy 
dynamics. Thank you so much.
    As you all know, there has been significant activity around 
the wholesale power markets throughout the West in recent 
years. In fact, Nevada has enacted legislation during the 2021 
legislative session that required every transmission provider 
in the state to explore joining a regional transmission 
organization by 2030. I am going to ask you both to comment 
because I know--I am curious, Mr. Christie, your comments and 
your concerns about RTOs as well.
    But Ms. Clements, let me start with you. Can you elaborate 
on this dating process as you termed it last month and speak to 
some of the western circumstances that were discussed?
    Ms. Clements. Thank you, Senator.
    I have been really pleased to see the developments in the 
West over the last five years. State regulators across the 
region, as well as state legislators across the region have 
identified how do we protect customers and reliability on a 
forward-looking basis. And so, they have been thinking 
deliberately and carefully about developing markets. They have 
taken some steps. They have joined balancing markets. They are 
considering joining day-ahead markets. They have not gotten all 
the way to a full-blown RTO, but they are exploring the 
opportunity. The dating is--there are several--at least two 
options, maybe a third, for RTO options for utilities to join. 
So they have a choice and they are kind of in a dating process 
right now.
    I think the important thing to say about RTOs is, while 
they are not perfect, the Commission has historically 
encouraged their formation or encouraged utilities to join them 
because they have, time and time again, saved customers, 
improved resilience, and improved reliability. Now, that said, 
the only way that they stay successful in that endeavor is for 
the market rules that they operate to evolve as circumstances 
in the world--like the changing resource mix, like the impact 
of extreme weather--evolve. So there is a real opportunity. And 
one of the nice things about the utilities and the regulators 
in the West is that they get to learn from all the lessons of 
the existing RTOs and try to bring forward best practices 
toward any action that they might decide to take.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    And I know my time is out, but Mr. Christie, at some point 
in time, I would love to get your thoughts as well, based on 
that conversation.
    Mr. Christie. Any time, Senator.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. I appreciate it.
    Senator Barrasso [presiding]. Senator Daines.
    Senator Daines. Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member Barrasso, 
thank you.
    As the Senate continues to work on permitting reform, I 
think it is really important that hydropower is part of the 
conversation. I think in Montana, hydropower accounts for 40 
percent of our state's electricity generation. It is a critical 
source for on-demand and black start energy for the nation. 
Hydropower is cheap. It is clean. It is reliable. It is energy 
for millions of Americans and we must continue to expand 
hydropower capacity across the entire nation. But I never 
thought I would live to see the day where there would be calls 
to breach hydropower dams, including individuals in the Biden 
Administration. Rather than talk about breaching hydropower 
dams, we should be talking about how we increase hydropower 
generation--it is one of the great renewable, zero-carbon 
sources of energy--by expediting the licensing processes, not 
going backwards and breaching dams.
    Over the last year, I have been working on a comprehensive, 
bipartisan hydropower licensing reform package that I hope to 
introduce in the coming days. The bill is supported by a very 
diverse group of stakeholders--the left, the center, the right, 
including two former FERC Commissioners and two former FERC 
Chairmen. It is going to expedite licensing and re-licensing, 
expand tribal engagement, streamline the permitting process, 
and promote the development of hydropower throughout the United 
states. And by increasing tribal engagement and expediting the 
permitting process for hydropower projects, including low-
impact projects, like pumped storage and closed loop, I think 
it is something that every member of this Committee should get 
behind.
    A question for Chairman Phillips and Commissioner 
Christie--do you think it is important for FERC to prioritize 
and expand hydropower licensing and re-licensing?
    Chairman Phillips, start with you.
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Senator.
    I do believe that hydropower is critical. It is very 
essential. It is clean, as you mentioned. It is renewable. I 
believe it can help us with reliability. We have taken on 
reforms in recent years to speed up our process regarding hydro 
licensing and re-licensing. We talk about expanding. I think 
you are talking about pumped storage as one element to that. We 
actually have an expedited process for pumped storage that is 
still being implemented. We look forward to working with you, 
and I met with sponsors recently on the legislation that you 
mentioned--the Uncommon Dialogue group. I applaud the efforts 
that have been made, especially to bring tribal communities to 
the table. These are factions that you mentioned that have 
been, you know, fighting each other for a very long time.
    Senator Daines. Right. Thank you, Chairman.
    Mr. Christie.
    Mr. Christie. Senator, I think hydro is very important. You 
know, FERC's strong suit is rate regulation. We are an economic 
regulator, but with hydro and these dams, the law gives us many 
more responsibilities than rate regulation. If it was up to me, 
I would take away our authority other than in the rate 
regulation area. We should not be the parks and rec department 
for a dam, but we are because we are told in the statute you 
have to consider, for example, recreation opportunities. We 
also have to do all the NEPA and Endangered Species Act, all 
those analyses. So the reason why this re-licensing takes so 
many, many, many years is because we have so many different 
interests that we have to weigh, and the statute says, 
``equally.''
    I don't want to be the parks and rec for a dam. I would 
just like to be the rate regulator for a dam. And I think that 
would expedite a lot of this re-licensing if those other duties 
were put in a more appropriate agency, which could be a state 
agency.
    Senator Daines. Great. Thanks for the comment.
    Speaking of tribal consultation, thousands of Montanans in 
the Indian Country rely on electricity generated from 
hydropower. It is important that our tribal members, 
particularly in the rural and underserved areas, have their 
voices heard and play an active role during FERC's decision-
making process.
    Chairman Phillips, do you agree that we should incorporate 
tribal consultation early and often during the licensing 
process for hydroelectric projects in Indian Country?
    Mr. Phillips. Yes. I take our obligation very seriously 
regarding tribal consultation. I have participated personally 
with government-to-government consultation, both as Chairman 
and as Commissioner.
    Senator Daines. Chairman, thank you.
    Last Congress, I was grateful to see my bill to expedite 
the process for powering non-powered Army Corps dams be signed 
into law. Non-powered dams have immense potential to provide 
abundant clean and reliable energy at a very low cost. 
Retrofitting non-powered dams to produce hydroelectricity is a 
common-sense approach that would greatly expand renewable 
energy supply, and lower energy costs.
    Commissioner Danly, do you agree that powering non-powered 
dams where it is both safe and economical is an important way 
to increase hydropower development and capacity?
    Mr. Danly. Absolutely. There are huge numbers, vast 
quantities of impoundments that could easily be used to produce 
electricity.
    Senator Daines. Thank you.
    For Chairman Manchin and Chairman Barrasso, I do hope we 
could work together to get my hydropower licensing bill in any 
permitting package moving forward.
    The Chairman. We will work on that, with everything else.
    Senator Daines. All right.
    The Chairman [presiding]. Senator Hickenlooper.
    Senator Hickenlooper. First, thank you all for being here 
and maybe I will come back to Senator Cortez Masto's question 
and let Mark Christie answer that in the framework of a larger 
question. It does circle back to that dating process of local 
utilities. There is some question about too much local 
transmission without enough oversight, and I wanted just to 
give you a few quotes of a recent meeting you had with state 
regulators. Daniel has some quotes up there.
    [Excerpts from the Fifth FERC-NARUC Transmission Task Force 
Meeting follow:]
GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT

    Senator Hickenlooper. Commissioner Dutrieuille from 
Pennsylvania said, ``we're seeing more and more and more local 
projects coming before us, instead of the more significant 
projects.''
    Commissioner French of Kansas said they ``need help 
examining the pace of investment and whether transmission 
owners are making the most optimal investments.''
    To put numbers to it, we will put another chart up here. It 
is my day for charts. From the Colorado-based Rocky Mountain 
Institute, this chart shows the stunning rise in local 
transmission in our nation's largest electricity market, PJM, 
before and after 2013, the year PJM updated its transmission 
planning. All three pairs of bars show different types of local 
transmission as a percentage of total spending on transmission. 
Since 2013, you can see we have been building much more local 
transmission across the board.
    [The chart referred to follows:]
    GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT
    
    Senator Hickenlooper. Every bit of this ends up on the 
ratepayers' bills at a time when everyone is hurting from the 
commodity prices and other increases. All the while, the 
development of large-scale transmission projects that I think 
in many cases create the greatest efficiencies on the grid, 
they've stalled. So within that, can you talk a little bit 
about it?
    Mr. Christie. Well, Senator, I think one of the problems 
with transmission spend has been that what we have today is, as 
you mentioned, in the RTOs in particular, 80-some percent of 
the spend is on what are called local projects, and they are 
coming out of one load-serving entity. And that is not 
automatically a good thing or a bad thing, but in terms of 
numbers, here's what happens though. You can go back many years 
in FERC history, but they get to come to FERC for what is 
called formula rate recovery. And formula rate recovery 
contrasts to state rate recovery--I was a state regulator for 
many years. Formula rate recovery is almost a plug-and-play 
type of process. It is very hard to challenge that. So what 
happens is, the RTOs are really not reviewing or vetting 
closely the local projects, but yet they are going into a 
regional plan, which means they are going to be cost-allocated 
across the RTO.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right.
    Mr. Christie. And then they come to FERC for cost recovery, 
and our formula rate mechanism is sort of an automatic, you 
know--it is very hard to challenge transmission spent there. 
And what has happened, too is, in the RTOs, several states, no 
doubt at the behest of lobbyists who did not want state 
regulators to take a closer look, have lobbied for laws that 
have stripped state regulators of the authority to vet these 
local projects. And so what you have is basically a situation 
where it is tremendously financially rewarding to build local 
projects because the RTOs are not looking at them that closely. 
The state regulators in many states have been stripped of 
authority to look at them. And then they get to come to FERC 
and get formula rate recovery.
    Senator Hickenlooper. And so, and I will go down the list, 
whether any of you, is this relative ease of self-approving 
local transmission coming at the expense of the larger 
projects? Why don't you each just take 20 seconds or 30 seconds 
at that?
    Ms. Clements. Thanks, Senator. I agree with most of 
Commissioner Christie's framing of the issue and I have been 
pleased that we have been able to work together on some 
mechanisms that get at this issue and I hope we can finalize 
some process on that front.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great.
    Commissioner Danly.
    Mr. Danly. So Commissioner Christie is correct, Senator, 
that formula rate treatment does have something to do with it, 
but there is something else though, which is that the more FERC 
attempts to establish mechanisms by which people are to plan 
transmission, the more strange incentives are created. And so, 
in part, it is an effort to get around and have easier 
treatment of transmission projects than our processes that we 
created for the purpose of improving competition, right, just 
like the markets. We created these processes. They create 
perverse incentives and it is easier to do processes for local 
transmission than the big projects you are talking about. So 
the more FERC you get, the less transmission you get in some 
cases.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right, which is regrettable.
    Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Phillips. Senator, this comes down to cost for me and I 
think the cure to it is more transparency in the local process. 
This is exactly why we are taking this up in our regional 
transmission planning NOPR.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. I appreciate that.
    And I have 25 seconds, so I will plan a question. Well, you 
know, it would take too long. I have another regional question 
and I will put that into the written record, as I am out of 
time. By the time I got halfway through the question, I would 
already be well over it. So I will yield back to the Chair.
    Thank you all for being here, really. This is very useful 
this morning.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I particularly enjoy sitting here in an energy committee 
room with the FERC Commissioners in front of us and having it 
be relatively calm. No protesters. No security at the door. My, 
times have changed.
    Senator Daines and I were just remarking that when both of 
us came here to the Senate, hydro was not considered a 
renewable resource. So I want to----
    The Chairman. Moonshine does wonders for it.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Murkowski. No comment, Mr. Chairman.
    Hydropower--I want to stick with the same theme that 
Senator Daines hit on because for us in the state of Alaska, 
hydropower is about 20 percent of our state's electricity, on 
average, every year. That is a pretty low amount, quite 
honestly, given the extraordinary hydropower reserves that we 
have, particularly in our southeastern part of the state. So 
many of our communities rely on small hydro, or run-of-river 
projects, and this is what is allowing them to get off of 
diesel-powered generation. But unfortunately, for so many of 
them, it is just so expensive. It is ridiculously expensive to 
go through the FERC process, to go through the legal battles. 
And so, what happens is, these communities are stuck. They are 
stuck with diesel generating power. And if that isn't an 
environmental injustice in and of itself, I don't know what is.
    So this is a question for you. I am not talking about big 
Bonneville or Hoover. I am talking about our small hydro 
facilities, our small, run-of-river, don't impact your 
fisheries. What more can we do? We have got to be doing a 
better job to ensure that these small and rural communities can 
have access to hydropower without it being cost prohibitive. 
There was a time, way back when, when we had actually advanced 
provisions that could allow these smaller hydro projects to 
avoid the FERC process. You know, that may be something that we 
need to be looking at, but what do you got? Because there has 
got to be a better answer than the status quo.
    Commissioner Phillips.
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Senator.
    We talked about this recently when I had a chance to speak 
with you. I agree with you and I understand the frustration, 
especially when you talk about some of these small operations, 
as you mentioned, mom and pop type operations dealing with this 
vast process. There are three different licensing processes 
that FERC has and they are different--from original to 
traditional to sort of like a hybrid. We also have a pilot 
project where we are, you know, considering other ways that we 
can process applications, but I absolutely agree, we have to do 
more to make this process more streamlined. I am focused on it. 
I have our entire Office of Projects team working on it.
    Senator Murkowski. So let me ask a question directly to 
that because you had mentioned, I think in answer to Senator 
Daines, that you were working to speed the processing. But one 
of the things that is concerning to me is, apparently, what we 
are seeing is that now there are numerous requests coming from 
FERC staff for additional information related to FERC licensing 
amendment applications. So in order to get the FERC approval of 
some pretty standard operation and maintenance activities, this 
is like in-kind replacement of equipment at the end of its 
useful life. So you have a situation where staff is asking for 
additional information that can theoretically delay the 
project, and further add to the cost of the project. So again, 
it gets back to we can't even start.
    So let me give you some specifics here. What we understand 
is, FERC's standard hydropower license conditions, these L 
forms, have long required prior FERC approval only when there 
is an activity that is ``a substantial change to the project 
works and plans.'' So now, what we are seeing is that FERC is 
not necessarily following those license conditions, they are 
requiring approval for activities that are clearly not 
``substantial.'' Again, what that does is, it requires--it 
demands a longer period to process and approve these license 
amendment applications.
    So if this is something that you are looking at, good. If 
you are not looking at it, I would just ask you to commit to 
going back to the Federal Power Act and FERC's standard 
licensing requirements and what they actually require--that the 
licensees are to maintain their projects in adequate operating 
condition, that the FERC require approval through license 
amendment only for substantial changes to the license, because 
what we are hearing is that there is now an add-on, and that 
add-on is adding time, and that add-on is adding cost and 
taking it to a place where you and I are in agreement--we need 
to be speeding up the process. We need to be streamlining the 
process and we need to be making it more affordable.
    Mr. Phillips. I commit to looking at this and working with 
your office to provide you the information you request, 
Senator.
    Senator Murkowski. Good. I will look forward to that.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Kelly.
    Senator Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Chairman 
Phillips and the other members, thank you for being here today.
    Chairman Phillips, in your testimony you mention that 
reliability is job number one, and the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law that we passed includes $3 billion to expand 
smart technology that allows for the efficient use of existing 
transmission lines. It enables demand response. It improves 
grid reliability. Demand-response technology can include smart 
thermostats or appliances that can save consumers money and 
also stabilize the electrical grid during times of peak energy 
demand. And additionally, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
contains a provision that I authored that directs the 
Department to promote the installation of demand-response 
technology in all federal buildings.
    And we have seen this technology work pretty well, 
especially in Arizona. In 2020, there was a regional heat wave 
that spanned 12 western states. It forced California to 
implement some rolling brownouts. And Arizona was only able to 
keep the lights and the air conditioning running thanks to this 
demand-response program. The utility was able to turn off the 
air conditioning in tens of thousands of homes and it kept the 
grid from crashing. And this also benefited customers. In 
exchange for this voluntary participation in this program, they 
got a rebate or a discount, and Arizona utilities were then 
able to sell some excess energy to California at the same time.
    So what is the status of the implementation of the demand-
response provisions that were put into the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law for federal buildings?
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Senator, for the question.
    I want to applaud the work of your office and this 
Committee for the Infrastructure Act. I believe demand 
response, I agree with you, is a critically important tool, 
especially when we have reliability events on the grid. As you 
mentioned, California has recently used it and many places in 
the West have used it. FERC has implemented Order No. 2222, 
which opens the market to distributed energy resources, 
including demand response. There is also a situation with opt-
outs. That is not included in 2222, but in another order, No. 
741, I believe, states have the option to opt out. We have a 
proceeding that is ongoing right now to address that opt-out.
    Senator Kelly. So they would be able to opt out from 
federal buildings?
    Mr. Phillips. No, sir. I am speaking more general. I am 
speaking more general.
    Senator Kelly. Beyond what we have today then, so this is 
voluntary in I think upwards of about 30,000 homes in Arizona, 
and that is voluntary, and people get a credit or a rebate. And 
then when we add it in federal buildings, that provides a 
bigger response that we can implement in times when we need it. 
What do you think we should be doing beyond that with this 
technology?
    Mr. Phillips. I think there is--first of all, to take a 
step back, many of the distributed energy resources that we 
talked about, they are behind-the-meter resources, you know, 
our state regulators, they have a significant role as part of 
their jurisdiction. I agree with you. The cheapest megawatt is 
the one you don't use. And so this is something that I continue 
to support. I am open to discussions and I look forward to 
working with your office to see what more we can do.
    Senator Kelly. All right. And I am going to quote you on 
that, ``the cheapest megawatt is the one we do not use.''
    Mr. Phillips. That's right.
    Senator Kelly. I am going to hold on to that.
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Kelly. And thank you, and thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I will yield back.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Hoeven.
    Senator Hoeven. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    According to the North American Electric Reliability 
Corporation, MISO faces a 1,300-megawatt capacity shortfall 
beginning this summer. And this trend is continuing to grow as 
older baseload requirements outpace new replacement generation, 
more variable generation. Both Commissioners Christie and Danly 
noted this critical problem in their written statements.
    So let's start with you, Commissioner Christie. Are there 
specific policies accelerating the retirement of coal and gas 
dispatchable resources, and what should be done to reverse this 
trend?
    Mr. Christie. Well, the RTO markets, which I have said 
before, are not true markets, they are administrative 
constructs. The rate designs are not working because, 
particularly in the capacity markets, when resources are 
heavily subsidized, they get to bid in at zero or close to 
zero. And the way these markets work with the pricing 
mechanisms is, they have a thing called a single-clearing price 
mechanism, and they start with the lowest bid. So if you get to 
bid in at zero, you are automatically going to clear, and then 
if they work up to the last unit, and the last unit is usually 
a gas combustion turbine or very expensive, and everybody else 
gets the top price. So the problem is, the financial incentives 
are driving out of these markets capital-intensive, or units 
that have high marginal costs like coal and gas, because they 
have to buy fuel, obviously, so their marginal costs are 
higher. So it is really a rate design issue in the RTOs.
    Now, in the non-RTOs, what is happening is that state IRPs, 
driven by state policies, are, you know, moving toward 
eliminating, particularly coal in many states and replacing 
with renewable. And again, the problem is, as I have said, is 
not the addition of wind and solar, the problem is the 
subtraction of dispatchable resources. And it is just not 
adding up. Now, at least in the state IRP you can correct. And 
I would give one example. Three years ago in Virginia, our 
largest utility, when I was on the Virginia Commission, filed 
an IRP, and it had a number of retirements, early retirements 
that Dominion was proposing. Those were factored into PJM's 
loss of 40 gigawatts that I mentioned at the beginning of this 
proceeding. Well, Dominion filed a new IRP just this week, and 
they have sort of corrected the one from three years ago, and 
they are going to keep units on board longer. So it's an 
example of how in an IRP structure you can change the resource 
mix and respond to needs.
    In these markets, there is nothing planned. These markets 
simply reward or don't reward. And so, the problem in these 
markets is, the units that we need to stay in operation are not 
being sufficiently rewarded to keep them in business, and they 
are giving up and shutting down.
    Senator Hoeven. And we have seen real problems because of 
that, with blackouts and brownouts and not having power when 
you have had polar vortexes in various parts of the country, 
have we not?
    Mr. Christie. Yes, I mean, PJM, in the Winter Storm 
Elliott, came very, very close to rotating outages. Now, one of 
the big problems was, a lot of gas did not show up. And the 
reason a lot of gas did not show up is because they did not 
have firm supply. And they did not have firm supply because 
they did not have enough transportation, and also the economics 
just don't work. And there have been a lot of complaints from a 
lot of independent gas generators and PJM, for example, about 
weatherization standards. They say they don't have the money to 
make the weatherization standards. Well, you know, units that 
are in rate base have the money to make the weatherization 
standards. Units that are--particularly IPPs that only depend 
on the markets, particularly the energy markets--the energy 
markets simply don't provide enough revenue for capital-
intensive units. That is why they came up with the capacity 
markets.
    And the bottom line is, they are just not working to keep 
enough resources available to keep the lights on. In an IRP 
situation, you can adjust, because you can make adjustments and 
make sure your portfolio is balanced. And that is what we need 
here, are balanced portfolios of all these different types of 
resources, from dispatchable to renewable, in a way that keeps 
the lights on at the lowest possible cost.
    Senator Hoeven. And this is at a time when we are 
aggressively working in states like mine, and certainly like 
the Chairman's, to capture CO<INF>2</INF> and sequester it, 
which, of course, adds some costs as well. That, again, 
increases your capital cost, but it captures CO<INF>2</INF> at 
the same time, but if you wipe out all those plants before we 
even get to that point, you lose all that baseload power for 
the system.
    I was going go to Commissioner Danly next, but since the 
Chairman is nodding his head, I have to jump to you and ask for 
your response.
    Mr. Phillips. Senator, I have to say I am extremely 
concerned when it comes to the pace of retirements that we are 
seeing of generators that are needed for reliability on our 
system. NERC and other grid operators have warned about this, 
as I mentioned earlier. This is something that we have to keep 
a careful eye on. We have to work with the states. They have 
plenary authority over resource adequacy. But there is an 
opportunity. We are resource neutral, but we are not 
reliability neutral. And so, I am focused on this issue.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Chairman.
    Committee Chairman, I beg indulgence for one more question 
for Mr. Danly. Would that be agreeable with you?
    The Chairman. Oh, my goodness, absolutely. I can't wait to 
hear it.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Hoeven. Okay, thanks.
    Mr. Danly. Neither can I.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Hoeven. Commissioner Danly, I would like you to 
weigh in on this issue too, as you have commented on it, and I 
would appreciate your comments here.
    Mr. Danly. So yes, I do. Thank you, Senator.
    So the problem is the subsidies that are being driven by 
the Federal Government and states in the markets, and it is our 
abject failure as an institution, FERC, to exercise our 
ratemaking powers to protect those markets from the influence 
of those subsidies. That is the reason why these retirements 
are happening prematurely, and the results, I fear, are going 
to be catastrophic down the road. The resource adequacy that 
typically resides with the states in an ordinary, vertically 
integrated utility set before the markets were established, 
they looked through IRP processes to make sure that everything 
was going to be--all the requirements for load would be met by 
sufficient generation, and that simply does not happen in 
markets. We rely upon market forces to accomplish that 
objective. And when we undermine the markets and we send warped 
and distorted price signals, it is impossible for that sole 
means of procurement to actually achieve the objective. It will 
ultimately fail, I am afraid.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Commissioner.
    Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thanks, Senator.
    I have one follow-up, and it is pretty simple. In today's 
world, and what you all have talked about, the energy and the 
grid system and all that, do any of you believe that it is 
possible to eliminate coal today or in the near future and be 
able to maintain a reliable or somewhat reliable system? Is 
coal intricately irreplaceable at this point in time?
    Chairman Phillips.
    Mr. Phillips. Senator, we have talked about this before. I 
believe in an all-of-the-above approach. Whatever resources are 
needed to keep our grid reliable, we have to make sure that 
they are available.
    The Chairman. I think what I am asking is, basically, we 
know that it is the only dispatchable we have. I have been told 
forever that you only have two baseloads, that is coal and 
nuclear.
    Mr. Phillips. Coal is still----
    The Chairman. Anything else can be interrupted, and even 
coal, if it gets bad enough, but usually the coal pile, if it 
is 60 days, it will run 60 days. If a nuke is fueled, it will 
run. Gas will run if you can get gas to it, but you have more 
chances of gas being interrupted. So there are only two you 
really have, for all of our period of time that I have grown up 
in, it has been those two.
    Mr. Phillips. Yes, sir. You are right.
    The Chairman. So if you pulled it off right now, would it 
give you the certainty that the system would give you the 
reliability needed?
    Mr. Phillips. It would not.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    Commissioner.
    Mr. Danly. Thank you. No. As things stand, coal is 
required. It makes up, I don't know, just under a quarter of 
all the installed capacity in America. And it would be 
impossible, given the locations and the realities of the 
electric system, to replace it.
    The Chairman. Commissioner Clements.
    Ms. Clements. Right now, today, no.
    Mr. Christie. Coal is more dependable than gas. And yes, we 
need to keep coal generation available for the foreseeable 
future.
    The Chairman. Coming from the coal fields, and having been 
born and raised in the coal fields, I have seen all the 
sacrifices that have been made to provide the energy the 
country has needed and also during the war efforts and 
everything else. There is a transition going on, and everyone 
understands the transition. The only thing I am trying to make 
a point on is, is that the expediency of which this 
Administration and other Administrations have tried to move the 
market or move their source of energy before we had anything to 
replace it with. And all you have to do is go talk to the 
Europeans. They will tell you, please don't do what we did. And 
I have spoken to all of them.
    And with that being said, we are using coal now, and I know 
in my state, I think every plant has been scrubbed. It has low-
NO<INF>X</INF> boilers. It has baghouses. Now, for the first 
time, we are putting an actual cost to help the sequestering. 
So it should be able to remove most of the concerns we have had 
from the environment while we still have a stable source. So I 
am thankful for that.
    Let me just say this--I appreciate it. It has been quite 
informing and you all have done a great job. The information 
you have given us and the advancement you all have made in the 
last year, working together as a team, I think, is admirable. 
And I thank you for that.
    Let me make sure--what do we have here? He is running back 
for what? Oh, is he here? Okay, hurry up, Josh.
    Senator Hawley has one follow-up question.
    Senator Hawley. There we go.
    Senator Cortez Masto asked on this ethics issue. Can we 
just go down the line? I know what the answer is as it respects 
Ms. Clements, but for the rest of you.
    Chairman Phillips, do you speak to industry groups, to 
donor meetings behind closed doors, of donors who may have a 
financial interest in your industry?
    Mr. Phillips. No, sir.
    Senator Hawley. Next.
    Mr. Danly. No.
    You can go ahead.
    Ms. Clements. I did not speak at a donor's meeting. There 
was no donating happening. And you don't have to take my word 
for it. You can talk to my agency ethics official, who saw no 
problem and has not seen any problem with any of the meetings I 
have taken during my term.
    Senator Hawley. But it was a meeting of funders--donors. 
You are saying there were no donations solicited, right?
    Ms. Clements. These are policy-focused foundations who 
participate in the sector by making grants, just like PE Shops 
make investments, just like CEO utilities make investments. 
There was no inappropriate conversation that took place.
    Senator Hawley. Well----
    The Chairman. If I can interrupt, just one second, to make 
sure I understand.
    I think what the Senator is trying to get to is, did any of 
you know you were going to a donor-sponsored event? There are 
going to be donors, my goodness, special interest is 
everywhere, I mean, everybody--but going and speaking in 
generalities of what you do, what your thoughts are and what--
you have all probably been in those, and you did not go and 
solicit, and say, well, I am going to a donor to give little 
bit of red meat, what they want, so they will give more. Is 
that correct?
    Is that where you are going, Senator?
    Senator Hawley. Well, I am disturbed by the idea that 
anybody--and this is why I was worried when Senator Cortez 
Masto asked the question, everybody answered yes. I just want 
to be sure that we are not going to events that are funders-
only events--funder means donor--that are donor events.
    The Chairman. You mean advertised as one?
    Senator Hawley. Correct. Yes, sir.
    The Chairman. Okay. Were any of them advertised as donor 
events?
    Senator Hawley. Yes, sir, this one was.
    What about you, sir?
    Mr. Christie. Not to my knowledge.
    Senator Hawley. Okay, yes, I would hope not. And we will 
have a lot of questions for the record on this.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to clarify that, 
because I am alarmed by it. Thank you.
    The Chairman. No problem. I get you. Absolutely.
    Let me just say to all of you again, I appreciate so much 
you all coming and being frank and forthright and doing the job 
you are doing. We have a lot of work to do, got heavy lifting 
to do, and the country needs to keep the lights on. So thank 
you for that.
    And any of our members will have until tomorrow afternoon 
to submit any of the other questions they might have.
    And with that, the meeting is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
