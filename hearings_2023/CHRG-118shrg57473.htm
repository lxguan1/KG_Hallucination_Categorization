                      THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
        Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:02 a.m., in 
room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Maria 
Cantwell, Chair of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Cantwell [presiding], Klobuchar, Tester, 
Rosen, Hickenlooper, Warnock, Welch, Cruz, Sullivan, Blackburn, 
Budd, and Capito
    Also present: Senator Grassley.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    The Chair. The Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation will come to order.
    Today we are hearing about what is driving up the price of 
prescription drugs, a life or death matter for many Americans, 
and the skyrocketing prices that affect them. Six out of every 
10 adults are currently taking at least one prescription drug, 
and about 1 in 4 of us take four or more prescriptions, so 
rising drug prices have really stretched Americans' budgets 
over the past decade. Since 2014, prescription drug prices have 
increased 35 percent, outpacing increases in wages, gas, 
Internet service, and food.
    So what is causing this sharp increase? So today we are 
looking at the mysterious middlemen in this, the prescription 
drug benefit market, the pharmacy benefit managers. Most 
Americans, I am sure, have never heard of pharmacy benefit 
managers, but they dictate the price people pay at the pharmacy 
and how people get their prescription, and in some cases, what 
treatments they can even receive.
    Diabetics have used insulin to treat their chronic 
conditions for the last 100 years, but in the past 10 years 
alone, the average price has doubled. Americans with diabetes 
cannot live without this drug, so when the prices go beyond 
what they can afford, they have to take drastic measures. For 
example, Molly Stenson, a Washington State resident, used to 
drive hundreds of miles to Canada to purchase insulin for $100 
because of the price that shot up in the United States to $450 
a month. Now that the state of Washington has temporarily 
capped the price of insulin at $100 a month, she no longer has 
to make that lengthy trek. But millions of Americans face this 
dilemma. Nearly 3 in 10 Americans report when the cost of their 
medication goes up, they cut their pills in half doses or stop 
taking their medication. This is not the kind of healthcare 
choices we want people to make.
    The evidence suggests that PBMs are part of the high drug 
cost increase. Just three PBMs control 80 percent of the PBM 
market. Pharmacy chains and health insurers now own the biggest 
PBMs, giving independent pharmacies, care providers, and 
patients nowhere else to turn when PBMs increase their price.
    Today, we will hear our colleague, Senator Grassley, a 
staunch supporter for reining in PBMs and a co-sponsor of 
legislation that helps to do that. I am grateful for Senator 
Grassley and for his experience and passion involving this 
issue and has used the Judiciary Committee for oversight of 
this PBM market as well.
    We will also hear from Ryan Oftebro of--CEO of Kelley-Ross 
Pharmacy Group, a Seattle-based independent pharmacy. Mr. 
Oftebro has had to stop serving long-time customers and close a 
location because of how PBMs dictate the amount his customers 
pay and what he can charge. In 2021, a PBM decision increased 
the co-pay on one drug from $15 to $141 for the same 90-day 
supply. That same PBM clawbacks cost one of his pharmacies over 
$538,000, up from just $81,000 in 2018. Mr. Oftebro will 
describe how the systematic interference by PBMs in the drug 
supply chain is picking the pockets of independent pharmacies 
and driving up consumer costs.
    We will also hear from Dr. Debra Patt, a practicing 
oncologist in Austin, Texas. Her research clinical decisions in 
support predictive analytics, health economics, and outcomes 
research give her a unique insight into the relationship here.
    Too often, the self-interested decisions of PBMS are 
overriding the skilled advice of M.D.s. Dr. Erin Trish is 
associate professor of pharmacy and health economics at USC 
School of Pharmacy and a--and a non-resident fellow in the 
economic studies of Brookings Institute. Her research focuses 
on the intersection of public policy in these health markets, 
and she will explain the structural reforms needed to address 
the complex role that benefit managers and other intermediaries 
play in pharmaceutical distribution. And finally, we will have 
Mr. Dr. Casey, a professor of economics at the University of 
Chicago, who I am sure will express his views about these 
issues as well. This gives us the importance to ask him 
questions about PBMs and their structure and their pricing.
    This legislation passed out of the Committee, the Cantwell-
Grassley legislation, in the last Congress by a vote of 19 to 
9, and I hope that today we can have a similar Q&A of our 
members to ask any questions, and hope that we could not just 
move this bill out of Committee but out of the Senate and over 
to our House colleagues.
    I'll now turn to the Ranking Member for his opening 
statement.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED CRUZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS

    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you to each of 
the witnesses. Welcome, Senator Grassley. I am used to joining 
you in the Judiciary Committee, but it is good to see you over 
in Commerce as well.
    Much like everything in healthcare, the cost of drugs 
historically has risen faster than overall inflation. Since 
1980, per capita drug spending, as adjusted for inflation, has 
increased more than sevenfold. And while Americans spend more 
on healthcare than people in many other parts of the world, we 
also spend less out of pocket on prescription drugs than those 
in many developed countries, including Switzerland, Canada, and 
Ireland. Thus, much of the higher spending on pharmaceuticals 
is baked into insurance premiums.
    Insurance companies know that Americans won't choose an 
unaffordable plan, so they hire a pharmacy benefit manager, 
PBM, to manage the drug portion of a policy. The PBM manages a 
formulary, or a list of covered drugs, which gives the PBM 
leverage to negotiate lower prices with big drug companies. Of 
course, the relationship between insurers, PBMs, drug 
companies, and others are complex, opaque, and confusing both 
to consumers and to providers. It is easy to see why PBMs might 
be singled out for more government regulation. They are the 
middlemen who are supposed to be negotiating lower drug costs 
from the big drug companies, wholesalers, and pharmacists. 
There is a lot of potential for PBMs to make a whole lot of 
enemies. Whether PBMs are deserving of this scrutiny is a 
question I hope we can get more answers on today.
    The other question I hope we can answer is this: do PBMs 
harm or benefit consumers? The answer should be decided by 
looking at the economic data across the entire drug supply 
chain, not just related to PBMs. The bill before us from 
Senators Grassley and Cantwell, the Pharmacy Benefit Manager 
Transparency Act, would give the FTC substantial regulatory 
power over PBMs. It seems the FTC has now become a catchall 
agency that Congress and the White House look to to regulate 
complex markets, like prescription drugs or gas prices, even 
when those markets might be reflecting problems caused by other 
government policies.
    I have long had concerns with the FTC's vague statutory 
authority, but at this moment, we cannot ignore the current 
state of affairs at the FTC. Under Chairwoman Lina Khan, the 
FTC has gone down an alarming path of regulatory activism and 
overreach. The extreme partisanship and concerning direction of 
Ms. Khan's FTC were exposed earlier this week with the 
announced resignation of the lone Republican FTC commissioner, 
Christine Wilson, a longtime friend and former colleague of 
mine when I worked at the FTC. Commissioner Wilson wrote in an 
op-ed, ``I refuse to give Khan's endeavor any further hint of 
legitimacy by remaining.'' This op-ed is stunning, and I would 
encourage anyone interested in the FTC to read it carefully.
    Ms. Wilson detailed how the agency has lost its way, citing 
Ms. Khan's willful disregard of Congress's limits on the FTC, 
including an attempt to regulate whole swaths of the U.S. 
economy with the Agency's first unfair method of competition: 
rulemaking. It is shocking that a commissioner would choose to 
resign rather than watch an agency's bipartisan tradition 
crumble in front of her eyes. Sadly, Commissioner Wilson's 
departure will now leave the FTC without a counterweight to 
Chairwoman Khan's activist agenda.
    I worked at the FTC, and I can tell you that with the 
Agency's overreach and activism, which will no doubt be 
difficult to sustain in court, it is no surprise that FTC staff 
morale has dramatically dropped. And so I am going to approach 
any bill to expand FTC powers right now, including this one, 
with extreme caution, especially now that there will be zero 
Republican commissioners and three Democrats.
    I'll flag one other concern for the bill. It would pre-
judge the results of the FTC's current study on the economic 
effects of PBMs. Last summer, the FTC unanimously voted to 
initiate a study on PBMs considering the access and 
affordability of prescription drugs. Consistent with the 
current FTC dysfunction, this study has had its controversy. 
Chairwoman Khan reportedly attempted to skew the study by 
refusing to study PBM impact on consumers, which is probably 
the most important question. That departure from standard 
economic analysis caused major internal disagreement and the 
resignation of the FTC's chief economist. But thanks to the 
hard work of the FTC staff, Commissioner Wilson, former 
Commissioner Phillips, the study was greatly improved, and I'll 
be closely monitoring it to ensure, in light of the turbulence 
at the FTC, that it is conducted objectively. I think we should 
wait on that study before legislating, and I look forward to 
this hearing to shine further light on this complicated and 
important question.
    The Chair. Thank you. We will now turn to Senator Grassley. 
Thank you so much for being here. Thank you for your leadership 
on this issue. I do not think this is something that you have 
been mildly involved in. I think this is something you have 
been actively involved in for a long time, so we welcome you to 
the Commerce Committee.

               STATEMENT OF HON. CHUCK GRASSLEY, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM IOWA

    Senator Grassley. Thank you for the invite to appear, and I 
hope this committee will have the same success that they had 
last session----
    The Chair. Is his button on?
    Senator Grassley.--of voting this bill out of committee. 
My----
    The Chair. Pull it a little closer. Yes, thank you.
    Senator Grassley. Sure, I can do that.
    The Chair. Thank you.
    Senator Grassley. Is that OK?
    The Chair. Yes.
    Senator Grassley. I hope this committee will have the same 
success voting this bill out. As you have said, I have been 
involved with Big Pharma for a long time. As Chairman of the 
Finance Committee, I hauled Big Pharma and PBM executives 
before that committee. I partnered with Senator Wyden on a two-
year investigation into insulin price gouging. Our 
investigation found that PBMs' scheme encouraged drugmakers to 
spike the drug's list price in order to offer a greater rebate, 
and then, in turn, secure priority placement on covered meds at 
the expense of many patients because I believe, like Senator 
Cruz just said, that the consumer ought to be the point of 
everything that we are trying to accomplish. And of course, 
then last, I have worked with bipartisan reforms to lower 
prescription drug prices, like I am working with you, Senator 
Cantwell. But there is more that we can do.
    Imagine a world where a cheaper product, yet equally 
effective, has a harder time selling. That is the prescription 
drug industry. One of the primary reasons for this is pharmacy 
benefit managers. Recently, as an example, a biosimilar 
competitor, through the high-cost Humira drugs, entered the 
market. While its competitor offered a 55 percent discount to 
its list price, the competitor cannot access patients. Why? 
According to the Wall Street Journal, ``PBMs and health plans 
are expected to prefer the more expensive version to get higher 
rebates.'' So if you wonder whether you heard that correctly, 
PBMs are blocking a cheaper product. This mirrors what my 
insulin investigation found now playing out with other drugs.
    PBMs will claim that they pass savings to consumers or 
through lowering premiums, but their spread pricing and their 
clawback tactics prove otherwise. Now, for your local 
pharmacist, and I will bet whether it is Texas or Washington, 
you hear about signing a contract at the beginning of the year, 
and then at the end of the year, getting a bill for thousands 
or maybe tens of thousands of dollars to pay back. That does 
not make sense to me. When PBMs go with a higher-priced 
product, consumers may pay more out of pocket before the 
deductibles kick in or through co-insurance. Today, three PBMs 
control 80 percent of the market. Now, that is why you hear me 
talking about the four big cattle slaughtering companies, 
controlling 40--80--85 percent of that slaughter, so the 
independent producers in my state cannot get a market because 
the big feedlots in Texas eat up 85 percent of the daily kill. 
So we must do something about the powerful middle people to 
lower drug costs for consumers.
    In 2018, I asked the Federal Trade Commission to assess 
consolidation in the pharmaceutical supply chain and its impact 
on drug prices. It took until last year for the FTC to take 
action and even start studying PBMs. It is welcomed action, but 
it is not enough. To ensure a timely FTC report, last week the 
Judiciary Committee passed out on a voice vote, along with five 
other bills--or four other bills that we passed out affecting 
the pharmaceutical industry, that--and we did it by voice vote, 
called the Prescription Price for the People's Act, also 
something that I am partnering with you on, Senator Cantwell. 
It requires the FTC to study pharmaceutical intermediaries and 
issue a report and recommendations to Congress within 1 year.
    A timely report on PBMs is critical, but we can stop some 
competitive action behavior right now. The Cantwell-Grassley 
PBM transparency bill directs the FTC to end well-known and 
documented PBM practices that drive up consumer price, namely, 
spread pricing and clawbacks. Both actions game the system and 
hurt consumers. Our bill has guardrails. It does not give FTC 
any new power or regulatory authority, and listening to what 
Senator Cruz says, I want to comment from this standpoint. If 
you would see where Senator Cantwell and I first started 
talking about this in July before the bill got out in 
September, you would see that this is a very, very narrow 
approach to this PBM problem through FTC, because I am like 
you. I do not want to give FTC more power, and if we give them 
more power, make it--circumscribe it, very much so. So I just 
hope that you'll take that into consideration as you look at 
it.
    So I want to repeat that little part I just read. Our bill 
has guardrails. It does not give FTC any new power or 
regulatory authority. The bill also puts sunshine on PBMs. 
Passing the PBM transparency bill is an important step to 
lowering drug costs. Thank you. And I am--I guess I thought I 
was going to get done in 3 minutes, and it took me 6 minutes. I 
am sorry. Thank you.

drive up consumer costs, namely: spread pricing and clawbacks. Both 
actions game the system and hurt consumers.
    Our bill has guardrails--it doesn't give the FTC any new power or 
regulatory authority. The bill also puts sunshine on PBMs.
    Passing the PBM Transparency Act is an important step to lowering 
to drugs costs.

    The Chair. Senator Grassley, we so appreciate your 
articulation of why the legislation is drafted the way it is. 
You are right, you and I had a conversation. I was looking at a 
broader anti-manipulation authority, which the FTC has used in 
other areas, and Senator Grassley said, no, let us get very 
specific about these activities. And so our staffs worked 
together over a long period of time to focus this so that the 
actions taken were very clear. So anyway, thank you for being 
here. I do not know if you have any questions on that. If not, 
Senator Grassley, thank you very much for being here today.
    Senator Grassley. Thank you.
    The Chair. We will now turn to our other witnesses. As I 
mentioned earlier, Dr. Ryan Oftebro, pharmacy--chief operating 
officer of Kelley-Ross Pharmacy in Seattle; Dr. Debra Patt, 
oncologist, Texas Oncology in Austin, Texas; Dr. Erin Trish, 
co-director and associate professor of pharmaceutical health 
economics at the Schaeffer Center, University of Southern 
California; and Dr. Casey B. Mulligan, Professor in Economics 
at the University of Chicago.
    So welcome to all the witnesses. If you will join us at the 
witness table we would appreciate it. And we ask each of you to 
make a 5-minute opening statement about this particular issue, 
and we will then go to question and answers from our 
colleagues. So again, thank you all very much for being here 
today, and we will start with you, Dr. Oftebro. And you might 
have to push your button there to be----

   STATEMENT OF RYAN OFTEBRO, PHARMD, FACA, CEO, KELLEY-ROSS 
                         PHARMACY GROUP

    Dr. Oftebro. Good morning, Chair Cantwell, and Ranking 
Member Cruz, and members of the Committee. My name is Dr. Ryan 
Oftebro. I am a pharmacist of 20 years, and I am owner and--of 
Kelley-Ross Pharmacy Group in Seattle, Washington. I am a 
clinical associate professor at the University of Washington 
School of Pharmacy, and I am here today representing pharmacy 
as a member of the Washington State Pharmacy Association, the 
American Pharmacists Association, and the National Community 
Pharmacists Association.
    Kelley-Ross Pharmacy is a better-known small business that 
has served the Seattle community since 1925. My father is a 
pharmacist and owned Kelley-Ross since 1973. I grew up in the 
pharmacy, and after serving in the Marine Corps, I attended 
pharmacy school at the University of Washington, and took over 
the practice in 2005. We currently have four locations 
providing high-quality care for our most vulnerable 
populations. Independent pharmacies like Kelley-Ross provide a 
crucial public safety role for our communities. Our ability to 
care for our patients is under a very real threat from harmful 
PBM practices that are costing our patients and limiting their 
access to pharmacy services. I appreciate the opportunity to 
speak in support of the PBM Transparency Act.
    Since 1989, Kelley-Ross Pharmacy operated a location in a 
Seattle neighborhood that was the preferred pharmacy for a 
labor group made up of both active and retiree members. The 
retirees were enrolled into a single Medicare Part D plan. This 
was an uncommon situation for a community pharmacy. However, it 
has provided us with some unique insight into how a PBM can 
manipulate the system at the expense of our seniors. To 
illustrate how this happened, we can look at one drug, generic 
rosuvastatin. It is an inexpensive medication used to treat 
cholesterol. Historically, a 90-day supply of rosuvastatin cost 
the pharmacy approximately $10, and patient co-pays were set by 
the PBM at $15 for a 90-day supply.
    Things changed in 2021, with patient costs increasing 
exponentially. The PBM moved rosuvastatin from their Tier 1 
with a nominal co-pay to their Tier 3, which historically had 
been reserved for brand name medications only. This increased 
the patient co-pay, which was set by the PBM, from $15 to $141 
for the same 90-day supply. There is no clinical rationale for 
this change, and there was no increase in drug costs. It simply 
created unnecessary out-of-pocket spend for the member, while 
creating a windfall for the PBM through the collection of 
retroactive generic effective rate, or GER, fees from the 
pharmacy.
    GER fees are designed by the PBM to recoup overpayments 
from pharmacies. In this example, the PBM manipulated the 
patient co-pay to intentionally overpay the pharmacy, costing 
the patient an extra $500 a year in out-of-pocket expense 
without the PBM contributing a penny to the transaction. The 
overpayment was then retroactively clawed back to the PBM as a 
GER fee. This was not returned to the patient. We saw this 
happen over 150 times in 2021 with generic rosuvastatin, and it 
occurred with many other medications as well.
    In 2018, our pharmacy had $81,000 clawed back from PBMs in 
the form of retroactive fees. This was a huge amount for us to 
incur, but we were able to remain sustainable. In 2021, this 
increased to over $538,000. It was largely driven by GER fees 
assessed by a single PBM for a single Part D plan, which 
resulted from artificial patient overpayments created by the 
PBM. This location was in the top 1 percent of all community 
pharmacies in the country in terms of our Medicare quality 
ratings for patient adherence, which means that presumably we 
were experiencing the lowest level of DIR fees. But because GER 
fees are assessed in aggregate across the network, there is no 
way of connecting a fee to a specific claim, but it is clear 
that the PBM was profiting at patient expense, essentially 
creating an invisible premium. These patients would have been 
better off without using their insurance, and that is not 
right.
    There is obviously no way that a business could operate in 
these predatory and--with these predatory and unpredictable 
fees, so we made the difficult decision to close this location 
in 2022. Unfortunately, this is not the only type of PBM abuse 
that we have experienced. PBMs will argue that their business 
practices keep costs down. In reality, their vertical 
integration with payers and their own competing pharmacies 
create massive conflicts of interest and self-serving business 
practices that are harming patients, increasing costs to 
employers, and closing community pharmacies.
    We need PBM reform, and this bill is a very good start 
toward providing transparency and protecting consumers and the 
pharmacies that care for them from these harmful PBM practices 
that add costs and unnecessary barriers to care. I would urge 
you to remove the exemption for PBMs that return rebates to the 
payer. My example demonstrated how a vertically integrated PBM 
could meet this exemption requirement and still cause economic 
harm to patients.
    Thank you for the opportunity to share my story, and I look 
forward to any questions.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Oftebro follows:]

           Prepared Statement of Ryan Oftebro, PharmD, FACA, 
                    CEO, Kelley-Ross Pharmacy Group
    Good morning, Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and members of 
the Committee.
    My name is Dr. Ryan Oftebro. I am a pharmacist of 20 years and 
owner of Kelley-Ross Pharmacy Group in Seattle, WA. I am a clinical 
associate professor at the University of Washington School of Pharmacy, 
and I am here today representing pharmacy as a member of the Washington 
State Pharmacy Association, The American Pharmacists Association, and 
the National Community Pharmacists Association.
    Kelley-Ross Pharmacy is a veteran-owned small business that has 
served the Seattle community since 1925. My father, John, is a 
pharmacist and owned Kelley-Ross since 1973. I grew up in the pharmacy, 
and after serving in the Marine Corps, I attended pharmacy school at 
the University of Washington and took over the practice in 2005. We 
currently have 4 locations providing high-quality care for our most 
vulnerable populations, including community pharmacy, Long Term Care, 
and community-based clinical services, and we have repeatedly been 
recognized for excellence and innovation by our profession.
    Independent pharmacies like Kelley-Ross provide a crucial public 
safety role in our communities. In our rural and island communities, 
the pharmacist is not only the most accessible but often the ONLY 
healthcare provider available within miles. Our ability to care for our 
patients is under a very real threat from harmful PBM practices that 
are costing our patients and limiting their access to pharmacy 
services.
    I appreciate the opportunity to speak in support of the PBM 
Transparency Act (S.127). This is a crucial piece of legislation to 
prevent PBM abuses, such as harmful ``claw backs'' after a prescription 
has been dispensed that are harming patients by overinflating their 
prescription drug costs and eliminating access to their preferred 
community pharmacies across the country.
    I would like to share an example of these abuses, that resulted in 
a group of Medicare Part D beneficiaries being overcharged hundreds of 
thousands of dollars and the closure of the community pharmacy that had 
served them for decades, crushed by retroactive fees.
    Since 1989, Kelley-Ross Pharmacy operated a location in a Seattle 
neighborhood that was the preferred pharmacy for a labor group, made up 
of both active and retiree members. The retirees were enrolled into a 
single Medicare Part D plan. This was an uncommon situation for a 
community pharmacy; however, it provided us with some unique insight 
into how a PBM can manipulate the system at the expense of our seniors.
    To illustrate how this happened, we can look at one drug. Generic 
rosuvastatin is an inexpensive medication used to treat cholesterol.
    A 90-day supply of rosuvastatin cost the pharmacy approximately 
$10.00 to acquire from our drug wholesaler.
    The highly inflated and completely arbitrary Average Wholesale 
Price (AWP) for this drug was $805.40/90 tablets. This value is set by 
the manufacturer and used as a contracting benchmark by PBMs.
    Historically, for a generic medication available from multiple 
manufacturers (multisource), we would submit the claim and the PBM 
would reimburse us at a level based on their proprietary software that 
determines the average actual acquisition cost of the drug. This is 
called the Maximum Allowable Cost (MAC) and is written into all PBM/
pharmacy contracts. The pharmacy would be paid right around $15.00, and 
the patients' copay would be $15.00 or less. Because this medication is 
an inexpensive multisource generic, it was usually found in the lowest 
copay tier 1 of 4 so the patient copays were nominal.
    Things changed in 2021, with patient costs increasing 
exponentially. The PBM moved rosuvastatin from Tier 1 with a nominal 
copay to Tier 3 which had historically been reserved for brand-name 
medications only. This increased the copay from $15.00 to $141.00 for 
the same 90-day supply. There is no clinical rationale for this change. 
It simply created unnecessary out-of-pocket spend for the member, while 
creating a windfall for the PBM through the collection of retroactive 
Generic Effective Rate, or GER fees, from the pharmacy.
    GER fees are designed by the PBM to recoup ``overpayments'' from 
pharmacies.
    In 2021, the PBM set a new Generic Effective Rate at AWP-90 
percent. They then set the pharmacy's reimbursement to intentionally 
``overpay'' at a rate of AWP-83 percent, which just happens to be 
$140.50/90-day supply. Because the copay for tier 3 medications was 
$141.00, the PBM covered none of the prescription cost and the copay 
for rosuvastatin was $140.50 instead of the $15.00 it was the previous 
year. A difference of $125/90-day supply or over $500 more for the 
entire year out-of-pocket for the patient.
    The PBM has now created a situation where the pharmacy was 
``overpaid'' (in the form of patient copays) above the guaranteed GER 
of AWP-90 percent, at which point the PBM charges the pharmacy the 
difference (AWP-83 percent versus AWP-90 percent). This allowed the PBM 
to claw back over $80.00 that they never paid to the pharmacy. 
Extrapolate this over the Medicare population and the PBMs are 
profiting billions of dollars from patients' copays alone. This is just 
one of the ways that PBMs are profiting from obscure and completely 
nontransparent pricing. To make the process even more convoluted and 
untraceable the GER is not based on a per-prescription basis. It is 
based on an overall aggregate of all prescriptions across all 
pharmacies within a pharmacy services administrative organization or 
PSAO, which interacts with PBMs on behalf of independent pharmacies. 
That way there is no possible way to attribute the claw-back directly 
to an individual patient's copay.
    This is just for one medication for one patient. We saw this happen 
over 150 times in 2021 with generic rosuvastatin, and it occurred with 
several other medications as well.
    These patients would be better off without using their insurance 
and that is not right. In these situations, the pharmacy might be able 
to offer a much lower cash price, creating a better situation for both 
the patient and the pharmacy. However, the PBMs have created tools to 
disincentivize pharmacies from offering a competitive cash price to 
these Medicare patients. PBMs track patient adherence in the form of 
Medicare Star Ratings. If pharmacies fail to meet the PBMs expected 
adherence rate for cholesterol medications, which only happens when the 
patient's insurance is billed, the PBM penalizes the pharmacy in the 
form of increased direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fees across 
ALL their claims. At the end of the day, the patient is faced with an 
unnecessarily high co-payment for a lifesaving medication, making it 
harder for them to take.
    In 2018, this pharmacy had $81,000 clawed back from PBMs in the 
form of retroactive fees. In 2021 it increased to $538,810. This was 
largely driven by GER fees assessed by a single PBM for a single Part D 
plan, which resulted from artificial patient overpayments created by 
the PBM. This location was in the top 1 percent of all community 
pharmacies in the country in terms of our Medicare Star ratings for 
patient adherence, which means we experienced the lowest tier of DIR 
fees.
    This contract move from MAC pricing to a GER also bypasses many 
pharmacies' ability to appeal a payment under laws enacted in most 
states typically referred to as MAC Appeals. This approach clearly 
attempts to circumvent legislative efforts to provide a level and fair 
playing field for all.
    There is obviously no way that a business could operate with these 
predatory and unpredictable fees, so we made the difficult decision to 
close this location in 2022.
    Unfortunately, this is not the only type of example of PBM abuses 
we have experienced.
Conclusion
    PBMs will argue that their business practices keep costs down. In 
reality, their vertical integration with payer and their own competing 
pharmacies creates massive conflicts of interest and self-serving 
business practices that are harming patients, increasing costs to 
employers and closing community pharmacies. S. 127 is a great step 
towards providing the necessary transparency on how PBMs administer 
their pharmacy benefit and holding them accountable when they 
participate in unfair or deceptive business practices which ultimately 
harm the patient.
    We need PBM reform, and S. 127 is a very good start. We need 
legislation that provides transparency and protects consumers and the 
pharmacies that care for them from the harmful PBM practices that add 
cost and unnecessary barriers to care.
    I would urge you to remove the exemption for PBMs that return 
rebates to the payer. My example demonstrated how a vertically 
integrated PBM could meet this exemption requirement and still cause 
economic harm to patients.
    Thank you for the opportunity to share my story, and I welcome any 
questions.

    The Chair. Thank you, Dr. Oftebro, and thank you for your 
work at the University of Washington as well. Dr. Patt, 
welcome. Thank you for being here.

STATEMENT OF DEBRA PATT, M.D., Ph.D., M.B.A., ONCOLOGIST, TEXAS 
                            ONCOLOGY

    Dr. Patt. Thank you, Committee Chair Cantwell, Ranking 
Member Cruz, and members of the Committee. I appreciate the 
opportunity to testify on my experience with PBMs. My name is 
Dr. Debra Patt, and I serve as a breast cancer specialist in 
Austin, Texas. I serve in the leadership of Texas Oncology, a 
large independent community oncology practice, and I am the 
Vice President of the Community Oncology Alliance.
    PBM transparency and accountability is critical because 
patients being able to get their oral cancer drugs in a timely, 
effective, and sustainable way allows them to realize the 
benefits of modern cancer therapy. PBMs steering the filling of 
these pills to their specialty and mail order, vertically 
integrated pharmacies all too often results in unnecessary 
delays, denials, and waste for cancer patients getting 
potentially lifesaving treatments.
    This is a remarkable time when instead of cancer treatment 
disrupting how patients live and work or even being a death 
sentence, they can enjoy their life with their cancer and 
control it as a chronic disease, much like hypertension or 
diabetes. Many Americans with cancer can continue to live in 
their own lives, work at their jobs, teach at their schools, 
pick up their kids from soccer practice, and eat dinner at 
their dinner tables. Oral cancer therapy accounts for about 30 
percent of these therapies today, and we anticipate this will 
grow to over 60 percent in the next few years, so this is a 
large issue and it is growing.
    The increasing use of these effective, but expensive, 
specialty drugs and their profit potential has attracted the 
top PBMs, with the largest three controlling 80 percent of the 
prescription drug market, and adding the next three largest 
adds to 96 percent of control. This gives these PBMs, who are 
owned by or own the largest health insurers, substantial 
leverage in controlling what treatment patients get and how and 
when they get it. PBMs frequently delay and deter appropriate 
and timely therapy for my patients.
    The delays and detours are difficult to anticipate and 
limit a doctor's ability to effectively control the cancer, and 
delays can lead to poorer disease control, morbidity, and 
mortality for the patients we serve. Doctors frequently modify 
treatment doses to optimize therapy and control toxicities, 
sometimes in as little as 1 to 2 weeks after starting a 
treatment. When a PBM mail order pharmacy is only willing to 
fill a 90-day script and supplies of cancer medications, then 
this can lead to extremely expensive waste as patients may get 
1 to 2 additional months of drugs that they cannot ultimately 
use.
    I urge you to read my testimony about my patient, Tonya, a 
40-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer that now is in 
her brain. Unfortunately, Tonya was blocked by PBMs and the 
insurer from getting the medication, abemaciclib, that I 
believe is one of the most effective therapies in treating her 
cancer and her brain metastases. As I saw her cancer 
metastasize and literally grow on the side of her trunk, I 
couldn't wait for the PBM and insurer to approve my appeal and 
had to resort to less effective and more toxic chemotherapy. 
Since December, Tonya has stopped working. When I saw her last 
week, we had to deal with two new brain metastases we observed 
on her scans and initiate radiation therapy to address these.
    I do not know for certain that Tonya would be better off if 
she had the pills I had prescribed. However, I do know that 
from the peer-reviewed literature, that she would have doubled 
her chances of living without cancer progression at this time 
in comparison to the chemotherapy that I had to give her, and 
that she would have had less toxicity, which would have allowed 
her to continue to work and live a more normal life, again, 
which is the dream of modern cancer therapy.
    Due to the power of the top PBMs, the majority of oral 
cancer drugs are not filled at our medically integrated 
pharmacy, but are steered by the PBM to their corporate-
affiliated specialty mail order pharmacy. PBMs will tell you 
that this is a cost-saving measure, but we do not see evidence 
that cost savings translates into patient or employer savings. 
In reality, PBMs control the practice of medicine. In addition, 
PBMs charge our--charge our medically integrated dispensing 
pharmacies steep DIR fees that are unanticipated expenses that 
are at a high percentage of total cost and increasing 
substantially. These are couched as quality measures, but DIR 
fees are not benchmarks on quality measures that are meaningful 
to my cancer patients. Things like the star rating is often 
benchmarked on hypertension and cholesterol medication filling. 
As a breast cancer specialist, you really do not want me 
controlling your hypertension or cholesterol, so this is 
problematic and not meaningful to cancer patients. We urgently 
need PBM transparency and accountability, and this legislation 
takes necessary steps to get us there.
    Thank you for your leadership in shining a light of 
transparency on PBMs. While PBMs operate in the dark, Americans 
battling cancer and other serious diseases suffer. Thank you 
for this time, and I am happy to answer any questions.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Patt follows:]

Prepared Statement of Debra Patt, MD PhD MBA, Medical Oncologist, Texas 
                                Oncology
    I thank Committee Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and members 
of the committee for the opportunity to share my views on PBMs.
    What follows is my written testimony with links to relevant and 
important references included. I highly recommend that the committee 
read these materials, starting with the expose on PBM tactics/
behaviors.
    As background, I am Dr. Debra Patt, an oncologist specializing in 
breast cancer in Austin, Texas. I serve in the leadership of Texas 
Oncology, a large independent community oncology practice that is part 
of The U.S. Oncology Network, and I serve as Vice President of the 
Community Oncology Alliance.
    PBM transparency and accountability is critical because patients 
being able to get their oral cancer drugs in a timely, effective, and 
sustainable way allows them to realize the benefits of modern cancer 
therapy. PBMs steering the filling of these pills to their specialty 
and mail order vertically integrated pharmacies all too often results 
in unnecessary delays, denials, and waste for cancer patients getting 
potentially life-saving drugs.
    This is a remarkable time when instead of cancer treatment 
disrupting how patients live and work--or even being a death sentence--
they can enjoy their life with their cancer and control it as a chronic 
disease, like hypertension or diabetes. Americans with cancer can work 
at their jobs, teach at their schools, pick up their kids from soccer 
practice, and eat dinner with their families.
    Oral cancer drugs account for about 30 percent of cancer therapies 
and we anticipate this soon growing to 60 percent. The increasing use 
of these effective, but expensive specialty drugs, and their profit 
potential, has attracted the top PBMs, with the largest three 
controlling 80 percent of the prescription drug market and, adding the 
next three largest, the top six PBMs control 96 percent of the 
prescription drug market. This gives these PBMs, who are owned by or 
own the largest health insurers, substantial leverage in controlling 
what treatment patients get and how, when, and where they receive it.
    PBMs frequently delay and detour appropriate and timely therapy for 
my patients. The delays and detours are difficult to anticipate and 
limit a doctors' ability to effectively control the cancer, and delays 
can lead to poorer disease control, morbidity, and mortality.
    Doctors frequently modify treatment doses to optimize therapy and 
control toxicities, sometimes in as little as 1-2 weeks after starting 
treatment. When a PBM mail order pharmacy is only willing to fill 90-
day supplies of cancer medications this can lead to extremely expensive 
waste or suboptimal dose modification.
    As a breast cancer doctor, I will illustrate some PBM issues using 
the oral cancer drug abemaciclib (brand name Verzinio) as I write for 
this medication frequently for patients with ER+ breast cancer. This 
drug is incredibly beneficial and improves survival in patients with 
advanced breast cancer but has some substantial toxicity with diarrhea 
that requires management and dose modification. The medication is also 
unique because it is helpful in treating brain metastasis, which many 
cancer therapies do not treat.
    Tania is a 40-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer that has 
now metastasized to her brain. When her cancer grew in October 2022, I 
recommended we use abemaciclib in addition to other medications on 
November 1, 2022 and explained to Tania that because we would have to 
go through her insurance company and PBM I was uncertain how quickly 
she might get the medication. I told her that the therapy has been 
published in peer reviewed literature and I was optimistic it was her 
best shot at continuing her quality of life and slowing her disease 
progression--especially in her brain. After the pills were denied, and 
I appealed, I was informed it could take six weeks to even have a peer 
review and they couldn't tell me when in the next six weeks I would be 
called to appeal the decision. While this seemed unreasonable, because 
it would allow Tania to feel well enough to continue to work and allow 
her to keep her hair, I was inclined to continue to try to get the 
medication for her. In the coming weeks as Tania was off treatment her 
disease worsened and she developed metastasis in the skin on the side 
of her trunk. I could see it growing and I told her we really couldn't 
wait any longer to see if her insurance would cover the abemaciclib, 
and we would have to do something different. In December, when I still 
had not been able to talk to a doctor to have her treatment approved, I 
started her on traditional chemotherapy in addition to a targeted 
therapy. Since December, Tania has stopped working. When I saw her in 
follow up last week we spoke about her two new brain metastasis we 
observed on her brain scans and how we would try to address those with 
additional radiation treatments.
    We very commonly see how vertically integrated PBMs and their 
corporately affiliated specialty pharmacies delay appropriate therapy, 
especially when they demand that patients use their mail order 
pharmacies to get their cancer drugs and other specialty therapies. The 
Community Oncology Alliance (COA) has done a good job of characterizing 
these challenges and relating real-life patient stories, which I have 
attached to this testimony. When you have an advanced cancer, delaying 
initiation of treatment can contribute to morbidity or mortality.
    Most often, with the PBM involved, we don't know when the patient 
will receive the medication, and after it is initiated, the cadence of 
refills is also a challenge. What the PBMs do is effectively ``rip'' 
quality medical treatment out of providers' hands and the site of care. 
Rather than help in care coordination they disjoint care. This leads to 
delays, denials, waste, and poor patient outcomes.
    For example, when I see patients with advanced breast cancer and I 
prescribe abemaciclib, I am seeing these patients every two weeks to 
make sure that their toxicity of diarrhea is well managed and so I can 
dose reduce as necessary. Dose reduction is common and important in 
cancer care as it can lead to improved tolerance of the medication and 
enhanced adherence. When patients receive oral cancer drugs at our 
office-based medically integrated pharmacy, we can see a patient, check 
labs, and made dose modifications prior to the refill. That does not 
happen when the drug is filled by a PBM vertically integrated specialty 
mail order pharmacy. Routine refilling usually happens from PBMs at the 
same dose, without real time dose modifications. This leads to wastage 
of a month's supply or the patient taking the incorrect dose that will 
make the therapy more toxic. For abemaciclib, that could result in well 
over $10,000 of waste per month.
    I will note that when we are allowed to fill the prescription at 
the point-of-care in our clinic, our medically integrated pharmacy is 
subject to fees typically months after the medication is filled. These 
fees are referred to as direct and indirect renumeration (DIR Fees). 
These are fees that are supposed to be anchored to quality but are 
based on factors that are not indicators of quality in the cancer 
patients we treat. These DIR Fees have grown considerably over time, 
with DIR Fees in our practice comprising less than four percent of 
total cost seven years ago to more than 11 percent of cost today. This 
is an unexpected expense that we cannot anticipate or influence. These 
DIR fees are based on quality metrics that are not reflective of 
quality treatment in the patients I serve. For example, filling drugs 
to treat blood pressure and high cholesterol is not something I usually 
do in a cancer practice. And I will additionally note that these 
onerous DIR Fees are also assessed on independent pharmacies across the 
country, causing many to close and creating pharmacy ``deserts'' for 
patients.
    I want to underscore, that due to the power of the top PBMs, the 
majority of oral cancer drugs are not filled at our medically 
integrated pharmacy but are steered by the PBMs to their corporate-
affiliated specialty mail order pharmacies. PBMs tell you that this is 
a cost saving measure, but in reality it allows them to effectively 
control the practice of medicine.
    We urgently need PBM transparency and accountability.
    I thank Senator Cantwell for her leadership in shining the light of 
transparency on PBM practices and for working with Senator Grassley, 
and his leadership, on an issue that knows no political divide. The 
lives of our patients, and your constituents across the country, are 
very at stake. Action to stop PBM destructive behavior is needed more 
than ever.
    Additional abuses of PBMs, including but not limited to the 
following:

  <bullet> ``Fail first'' step therapy requiring cancer patients to 
        first fail on inferior cancer treatment or supportive care 
        therapy before getting the most effective medication.

  <bullet> Using prior authorizations to unduly delay and even deny 
        cancer treatment.

  <bullet> ``Trolling'' patients to steer them to PBM-owned or 
        affiliated mail order pharmacies causing patient confusion and 
        worry.

  <bullet> Using rebates literally to extort price concessions from 
        pharmaceutical manufacturers that do not get passed on to 
        patients and to block using the least expensive drug like a 
        biosimilar.

  <bullet> Using ``co-pay accumulators'' to pocket co-pay assistance 
        funding that should be going to reduce patients' deductibles.

    Rather than elaborate on all the PBM abuses I see on a daily basis, 
I am including with this testimony materials that will help the 
committee better understand the abuses of PBMs, and how they have 
infiltrated other areas of medicine. However, so as not to make this 
document unmanageable in e-mailing, I have included links (below) 
hyperlinked to the source material. This research was aggregated with 
the assistance of the Community Oncology Alliance.
    Thank you for the opportunity of testifying and submitting this 
written testimony for the record.

          STATEMENT OF ERIN TRISH, Ph.D., CO-DIRECTOR,

       LEONARD D. SCHAEFFER CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY AND

        ECONOMICS, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PHARMACEUTICAL

         AND HEALTH ECONOMICS, MANN SCHOOL OF PHARMACY

                  AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES,

               UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

    Dr. Trish. Great. Thank you. Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member 
Cruz, and other members of the Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify here today. My name is Erin Trish, and I 
co-direct the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and 
Economics at the University of Southern California.
    The Schaeffer Center strives to measurably improve value in 
health through evidence-based policy solutions, research 
excellence, and public and private sector engagement. As part 
of this mission, my colleagues and I have been studying 
prescription drug markets for over a decade. Prescription drug 
markets are complicated, and it takes a lot of boxes and arrows 
to show you even a simplified version of how the dollars and 
goods flow. While that type of complexity keeps health 
economists like me in business, it still remains a mystery to 
most Americans, and we know that where there is mystery, there 
is margin.
    Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which operate in the 
middle of the pharmaceutical supply chain, play an important 
role in drug pricing. Historically, PBMs were independent from 
health plans and added value by reducing prices, encouraging 
uptake of generics, and expanding the use of mail order 
services. However, a wave of consolidation and other activities 
in the last few years have distorted behavior. Unfortunately, 
evidence indicates that PBMs are now leveraging their position 
to extract profits in ways that are detrimental to patients, 
payers, and the drug innovation ecosystem more broadly.
    Perhaps one of the most well-studied issues has been the 
use of rebates. Rebates drive a wedge between a drug's list 
price and its net price, or the amount the manufacturer 
actually receives. Schaeffer Center research has shown that for 
every $1 increase in estimated rebates, list prices increased 
$1.17 between 2015 and 2018. These rebates have grown 
considerably over the last decade, distorting the market and 
raising costs for many patients at the pharmacy counter.
    The incentives are particularly perverse. Beneficiaries pay 
the most as a share of the net cost of the drug--for drugs that 
face the most competition where rebates tend to be largest. The 
ultimate result of these practices is to decrease the effective 
generosity of insurance by reducing premiums but increasing 
out-of-pocket costs. Put another way, the system transfers 
financial resources from sick patients to healthy premium-
paying beneficiaries, the opposite of what insurance is 
supposed to do. Take insulin, for example. Insulin is a highly 
competitive drug class with rebates typically greater than 50 
percent of the list price. Nonetheless, many patients face high 
out-of-pocket costs for insulin, precisely because list prices 
are inflated so PBMs can extract large rebates.
    Schaeffer Center research also demonstrates the importance 
of following the money. My colleagues found that while total 
expenditures per unit of insulin remained relatively stable 
from 2014 to 2018, manufacturers are actually getting paid less 
year over year. Meanwhile, the share of spending captured by 
PBMs increased 155 percent over that 5-year period. At this 
point, less than half of each dollar spent on insulin goes to 
the manufacturers. Instead, the majority gets siphoned away by 
distribution system intermediaries, a parasitic loss, if you 
will.
    Other examples abound. For one, a 2018 Schaeffer Center 
study found that 23 percent of prescriptions involved a patient 
co-payment that exceeded the cost of the prescription to the 
PBM, or a so-called co-pay clawback. That is, the patient paid 
too much and the PBM kept the difference. Another: 
investigations and lawsuits in recent years have illuminated 
the pervasive practice of spread pricing, where PBMs charge 
health plans and payers more for a given transaction than what 
they reimburse to the pharmacy, keeping the spread or 
difference. For example, a 2018 Ohio auditor report found that 
PBMs charged the state a spread of more than 31 percent for 
generic drugs for its Medicaid plans. And another: in 2020, 
PBMs extracted $9-and-a-half billion in price concessions, the 
type we have heard about from the previous two witnesses, from 
pharmacies on Part D--on Medicare Part D transactions alone, up 
over 1,000 percent from a decade prior.
    These issues might be less concerning if we believed our 
current system of pharmaceutical distribution and reimbursement 
centered on and orchestrated by PBMs was working efficiently. 
Unfortunately, evidence suggests that it is not. When my 
colleagues and I compared cash prices for common generic drugs 
at Costco with their cost to the Medicare system, we found that 
Medicare overpaid on 43 percent of prescriptions in 2018, 
totaling $2.6 billion in overspending for the program in that 
year alone.
    It is clear that reforms are needed to improve the 
functioning of the pharmaceutical distribution system and 
ensure that the system works to benefit patients and drive 
value. These could include things like increasing transparency, 
prohibiting tactics that feed off the current complexity, and 
further investigation to better understand the myriad ways the 
current system harms consumers and reduces innovation. Thank 
you, and I look forward to your questions.

   Prepared Statement of Erin Trish, Ph.D., Co-Director, Leonard D. 
Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics, Associate Professor of 
   Pharmaceutical and Health Economics, Mann School of Pharmacy and 
       Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Southern California
Key Points:
1)  Structural reforms are needed to address the complex and 
        influential role that intermediaries--especially pharmacy 
        benefit managers (PBMs)--play in the pharmaceutical 
        distribution system.

2)  PBMs historically served a useful role to lower costs through price 
        negotiation, greater use of generics, and expansion of mail-
        order services. But consumers have been left behind by recent 
        trends in the PBM marketplace.

3)  Rebates, spread pricing, clawbacks, vertical integration, and other 
        practices allow PBMs to hide cost savings from patients and 
        payers.

4)  PBMs and other intermediaries capture an increasing share of drug 
        expenditures--for example, more than half of spending on 
        insulin--distorting drug pricing and reducing manufacturer 
        incentives to innovate.

5)  Greater transparency is needed in this marketplace, and PBMs should 
        be required to share savings with consumers and plans.

    Chairwoman Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and other distinguished 
members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify 
before you today about the need for transparency and accountability in 
the pharmacy benefit manager market. The opinions I offer today are my 
own, and build on previous statements.
    My name is Erin Trish and I co-direct the Leonard D. Schaeffer 
Center for Health Policy & Economics at the University of Southern 
California. The Schaeffer Center strives to measurably improve value in 
health through evidence-based policy solutions, research excellence, 
and public-and private-sector engagement. As part of this mission, my 
colleagues and I have been studying prescription drug markets for over 
a decade.
    Prescription drug markets are complicated, and it takes a lot of 
boxes and arrows to show you even a simplified version of how the 
dollars and goods flow. While this complexity keeps health economists 
like me in business, it still remains a mystery to most Americans. And 
where there is mystery, there is margin.
    Pharmacy Benefit Mangers (``PBMs'')--which operate in the middle of 
the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain--play an important role in drug 
pricing. PBMs manage drug benefits on behalf of health insurers 
(including Medicare Part D plans) and employers, creating formularies 
and leveraging their bargaining power to negotiate rebates from 
manufacturers.
    Historically, PBMs were independent from health plans and added 
value by reducing prices, encouraging uptake of generics, and expanding 
mail-order services. However, a wave of consolidation in the last few 
years--including health insurers buying up PBMs and PBMs expanding 
their footprint in pharmacy markets--and other activities have 
distorted behavior. Unfortunately, evidence indicates that PBMs are now 
leveraging their position to extract profits in ways that are 
detrimental to patients, payers, and the drug innovation system more 
broadly.
    Perhaps one of the most well-studied issues has been the use of 
rebates. Rebates drive a wedge between a drug's list price and its net 
price, or the amount the manufacturer actually receives. In fact, 
increasing rebates are one of the key drivers of increasing list prices 
over time; Schaeffer Center research has shown that for every $1 
increase in estimated rebates, list prices increased $1.17 between 2015 
and 2018.
    Our research sheds light on how patients have been harmed by 
rebates in the Medicare Part D program. Rebates--as a share of total 
drug costs in Medicare Part D--have more than doubled over the last 
decade. We estimate that about half of Part D beneficiaries who do not 
receive low-income subsidies would pay less out-of-pocket if rebates 
were applied at the point of sale. The incentives are particularly 
perverse--beneficiaries pay the most (as a share of the net cost of the 
drug) for drugs that face the most competition, where rebates tend to 
be largest.
    PBMs have deflected blame for these rebate practices by pointing 
out that they pass through most of the rebates they collect to health 
plans, who may then use them to keep premiums low for beneficiaries. 
But the ultimate result of such practices is to decrease the effective 
generosity of insurance by reducing premiums but increasing out-of-
pocket costs. Put another way, this system transfers financial 
resources from sick patients to healthy premium-paying beneficiaries--
the opposite of what insurance is supposed to do. Instead, with the 
current system, patients who do not respond to cheaper therapies are 
subject to ``double jeopardy''--not only is their condition 
recalcitrant, but now they have to pay more out-of-pocket.
    Beyond these distributional issues, rebates distort market 
incentives. There is indirect evidence to suggest that PBMs favor high 
list price, high rebate drugs over drugs with a lower net cost, 
although it is hard to prove definitively without access to actual 
rebate data. But, as an example, one analysis of Medicare Part D 
formularies demonstrated that 72 percent placed at least one branded 
drug in a lower cost-sharing tier than its generic product.
    The recent FDA approval of the first interchangeable insulin 
biosimilar provides another instructive example. Viatris simultaneously 
launched two versions of the drug--a branded product (Semglee) with a 
relatively high list price and presumably large rebates, and an 
authorized but unbranded version (Insulin Glargine) with a list price 
65 percent lower than Lantus (the reference drug). Despite that 
significant discount, Glargine has not gained traction on PBM 
formularies.
    Insulin is a highly competitive drug class, with rebates typically 
greater than 50 percent of the list price. Nonetheless, many patients 
face high out-of-pocket costs for insulin--precisely because list 
prices are inflated so PBMs can extract large rebates. Efforts to cap 
patients' out-of-pocket spending on insulin help, but they are a Band-
aid for a much more systemic disease.
    Schaeffer Center research also demonstrates the importance of 
following the money. My colleagues found that, while total expenditures 
per unit of insulin remained relatively stable from 2014 to 2018, 
manufacturers are actually getting paid less year-over-year. You might 
ask who is making more. It turns out the share of spending captured by 
PBMs increased 155 percent over the five-year period. When we are 
spending roughly $400 billion per year on drugs, that increasing margin 
adds up.
    At this point, less than half of each $1 spent on insulin goes to 
manufacturers. Instead, the majority gets siphoned away by distribution 
system intermediaries--a parasitic loss, if you will. This trend is 
true across other drugs too. This reduces incentives for innovation and 
redirects spending away from the companies developing new therapies to 
improve health and save lives.
    PBM issues expand beyond rebates--take generic drugs, which 
typically do not provide rebates to PBMs. Nonetheless, there is 
evidence that PBMs often overcharge for generic drugs. My colleagues 
and I compared the prices that Medicare Part D plans pay for common 
generic drugs to the prices at Costco pharmacies. We found that--
relative to Costco's member prices--Medicare Part D plans overspent on 
generics by $2.6 billion in 2018. While there is robust competition 
among these common generic drugs, the marketplace leaves room for PBMs 
and other intermediaries to capture the value rather than share it with 
beneficiaries and taxpayers.
    Other examples abound. A 2018 Schaeffer Center study found that 23 
percent of prescriptions involved a patient copayment that exceeded the 
cost of the prescription to the PBM--or a so-called copay ``clawback.'' 
This finding stands in stark contrast to testimony offered a year prior 
by a PBM lobbyist to the Senate HELP Committee that PBMs did not 
support the practice of collecting patients' copay in excess of the 
cash price and that, if such practices happened, they were 
``outliers.'' <SUP>i</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \i\ Testimony of Mark Merritt, CEO of PCMA, to Senate HELP 
Committee, October 17, 2017. See exchange with Senator Susan Collins 
beginning at 1:15:55.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It is not only patients who bear the cost of these market 
distortions, but increasingly pharmacies too. In 2020, PBMs extracted 
$9.5 billion in price concessions--categorized as direct and indirect 
remuneration (``DIR'')--from pharmacies on Medicare Part D transactions 
alone, up over 1,000 percent from a decade prior. Moreover, 
investigations and lawsuits in recent years have illuminated the 
pervasive practice of ``spread pricing,'' where PBMs charge health 
plans and payers more for a given transaction than what they reimburse 
to the pharmacy, keeping the ``spread'' or difference. A 2018 Ohio 
Auditor report--one of the earliest such investigations--found that 
PBMs charged the state a spread of more than 31 percent for generic 
drugs for its Medicaid plans, with taxpayers ultimately footing the 
bill.
    It is clear that reforms are needed to improve the functioning of 
the pharmaceutical distribution system and ensure that the system works 
to benefit patients and drive value. In today's market, PBMs are 
exploiting its complexity and opacity to increase profits while 
avoiding scrutiny.
    More transparency is sorely needed, and policy solutions that work 
toward that goal should be pursued. Existing PBM tactics that feed off 
market opacity--like spread pricing and clawbacks--should be 
prohibited. More transparency is needed on the structure and magnitude 
of rebates and other fees, particularly as contracts and fee structures 
of PBMs and their affiliates evolve. Likewise, additional insight is 
needed into PBM-pharmacy reimbursement, particularly as PBMs play an 
increasing role in pharmacy and specialty pharmacy markets, with 
increasing vertical integration interjecting additional layers of 
complexity and scope for arbitrage.
    While policy to provide such transparency is needed now, there is 
also more to learn. Further investigation is warranted to better 
understand the myriad ways the current system harms consumers and 
reduces innovation--especially innovation that will lower costs for 
everyone. In such a complex and opaque market, research using publicly-
available data can only get us so far; more detail is needed to better 
follow the money. Regardless, more competition between PBMs would help, 
and increased transparency is an important first step toward achieving 
that goal.
    I look forward to your questions.

    The Chair. Thank you very much, Dr. Trish. Thank you in 
general for your work. Dr. Mulligan.

          STATEMENT OF CASEY B. MULLIGAN, PROFESSOR OF

        ECONOMICS AND PROGRAM DIRECTOR OF THE INITIATIVE

       ON ENABLING CHOICE AND COMPETITION IN HEALTHCARE,

                     UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO

    Dr. Mulligan. Good morning, Chairman Cantwell, and Ranking 
Member Cruz, and members of the Committee. Thank you for this 
opportunity to comment on the economics of pharmacy benefit 
management.
    Prescription drugs greatly contribute to public health, but 
they are expensive to develop, which brings economics front and 
center. Drug insurance plans understand that it is wasteful, 
namely requiring premiums that are too high to attract members 
to have third-party payment and leave the benefit unmanaged. 
Benefit management is fundamentally an economic activity 
involving planned design, such as allocating drugs to different 
co-pay tiers, drug utilization reviews that help improve drug 
effectiveness, obtaining rebates and discounts from those 
providers whose sales are increased by the plan.
    Group purchasing and negotiated discounts are even more 
valuable when manufacturers and pharmacy companies are 
monopolistic or oligopolistic. Buyers' clubs can and do take a 
small amount of competition among sellers and magnify it. 
Naturally, they benefit buyers, but it is not a zero sum game. 
Buyers' clubs benefit buyers more than they cost sellers, and 
sometimes benefit sellers too.
    Group purchasing and negotiated discounts are tools 
familiar from buyers' clubs, such as Costco and Sam's Club. 
Costco members may not have a particularly price-sensitive 
demand for specific brands of, say, skateboards, but skateboard 
manufacturers, if they dealt with them individually, would hike 
their prices, but Costco limits who can sell to their members 
to those pricing the lowest. Sellers' best response in this 
situation is to steeply discount and partly make up on volume. 
Lower prices in higher quantities are the proof that buyers' 
clubs are pro-competitive.
    PBMs are buyers' clubs for members of multiple drug plans. 
Much like Costco excludes skateboard manufacturers, PBMs can 
place a manufacturer's products to incentivize discounts for 
consumers. Any buyers' club requires resources. These costs 
limit the scope and degree of involvement of buyers' clubs in 
the economy. Costco and PBMs have innovated to become more 
productive and thereby expand their contribution. Keenly aware 
of the common economics, Costco itself has gotten hugely into 
the business, purchasing, I believe, three PBMs of different 
types.
    Regulation is likely to be the opposite of this process by 
raising management costs and reducing discounts received by 
members of health insurance plans. Indeed, drugs plans and 
their PBM agents have done a remarkable job at getting 
prescriptions to the patients who need them. Studies repeatedly 
show that drug utilization is essentially as high before patent 
expiration as it is after, even though the cheaper generics are 
available only after expiration. PBMs and plans also do the 
advanced financials for unique new drugs under development so 
that plan members can get access as soon as possible after FDA 
approval. Sadly, European patients do not have PBMs working for 
them, and they are treated with less effective, older 
generation oncology and other drugs.
    With the Federal Government as a partner in paying premiums 
and medical procedures that can result from poor adherence, 
PBMs help taxpayers, too, and thereby the wider economy. I 
estimate that benefit management expands the economic pie more 
than $145 billion per year. The other side of the coin is that 
manufacturers and pharmacy companies may push for regulations 
to restrict the activities of buyers' clubs. I estimate that a 
variety of such regulations benefit manufacturers and pharmacy 
companies to some degree, but at greater cost to patients, 
plans, and taxpayers, because their regulations forego part of 
that $145 billion.
    In the likely case that large, incumbent PBMs better adapt 
to regulation than smaller new ones do, another unintended 
consequence would be reduced competition, namely, growing up 
big PBMs at the expense of the little ones. Section 2 of 
today's bill gives PBMs two compliance options, one requiring 
them to publicly disclose their remuneration, and the other 
prohibiting pharmacy discounts that are obtained ``arbitrarily, 
unfairly, or deceptively.'' How will Chairman Khan interpret 
those words, I do not know, so I have worked out a few 
different scenarios.
    One scenario involves significant costs to protect pharmacy 
companies from competition, adding between $8 and $11 billion 
annually to the Federal deficit. Another scenario is dominated 
by the mandatory disclosures that, as DOJ, FTC, and others have 
warned, may undermine competition among manufacturers, and 
among pharmacies, and among PBMs. The annual net costs of 
producing just manufacturer competition could easily exceed $25 
billion annually and add $20 billion annually to the Federal 
deficit. Also, reducing pharmacy and PBM competition could 
potentially bring the total addition to the deficit of $40 
billion annually.
    Thank you, and I welcome your questions.

  Prepared Statement of Casey B. Mulligan, Professor of Economics and 
 Program Director of The Initiative on Enabling Choice and Competition 
                  in Healthcare, University of Chicago
    Good morning Chairman Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz and Members of 
the Committee. Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the 
economics of pharmacy benefit management.
    Benefit management is fundamentally an economic activity. Because 
it is about contracting, coordination and trade, market-level economic 
analysis is required to fully understand its effects.
    Including a 2018-19 leave of absence to serve as the Chief 
Economist of the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), I have 
been a Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago for 20 
years, and Associate and Assistant Professors before that. I have 
published extensively on regulatory economics including healthcare 
regulation.\1\ I cowrote the textbook Chicago Price Theory, which is 
novel in terms of its emphasis on the role of what we call ``buyers' 
clubs'' in the economy. My research into the details of PBM operations 
began in 2018 when President Trump directed the CEA to estimate the 
economic and fiscal effects of rebate regulation.\2\ Hearing from 
various industry participants and government experts, I built an 
artificial intelligence (AI) model of the regulatory effects. Six 
months later, the AI platform I created for answering regulatory and 
many other economic and statistical questions won a 2019 Wolfram 
Innovator Award.\3\ Returning to the University of Chicago, I prepared 
research papers specifically relating the economics of buyers' clubs to 
employer-sponsored health insurance (Mulligan 2021a) and pharmacy 
benefit management (Mulligan 2022). Most recently I completed the 
development of an open-source quantitative model of the economic and 
fiscal effects of regulating pharmacy benefit management.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ These include Mulligan and Shleifer (2005), Mulligan (2015), 
and Mulligan (2021b).
    \2\ Chapter 10 of You're Hired! Untold Successes and Failures of a 
Populist President describes the genesis of the ``rebate rule'' (84 FR 
2360) and its regulatory impact analysis.
    \3\ My TheoryGuru platform, which is written in the Wolfram 
Language, has been the basis for cooperation with computer scientists 
who specialize in the type of artificial intelligence known as 
``automated reasoning'' or ``quantifier elimination'' (QE). See 
Mulligan, Bradford, et al., (2018a), Mulligan, Bradford, et al., 
(2018b), or Mulligan, Davenport and England (2018). Although the domain 
of QE is narrower than the more famous chatbot systems (such as 
ChatGPT), QE rigorously adheres to arithmetic and logical deduction and 
never contradicts itself.
    \4\ Mulligan (2023). In conducting these last two studies, I 
received financial support from the Pharmaceutical Care Management 
Association, understanding that it had no control over the ultimate 
findings or their distribution.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    My conclusions and opinions are based on my own research, teaching, 
and experience with economic regulation. They do not necessarily 
represent the views of the University of Chicago or of the prior 
administration.
The Economics of Benefit Management in the Context of Prescription-Drug 
        Markets
The path from medical innovation to health
    Prescription drugs have reduced mortality and morbidity from heart 
disease, cancer, infectious disease, and many other health 
conditions.\5\ The U.S. market size is approaching $500 billion 
annually, with about two-thirds of adults using them and almost 300 
million people participating in prescription-drug insurance plans. With 
the market so profoundly affected by public policy, it is essential to 
understand its structure, conduct and performance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ Lichtenberg (2003, 2007, 2019).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A fundamental fact is that even cost-effective new drugs are 
expensive to develop (Lichtenberg 2019), which drives a demand for 
third-party financing, both of which can distort drug utilization. 
Drugs may be underutilized because of high marginal costs to the 
patient, lack of patient knowledge, inadequate supply chain 
infrastructure, or the moral hazard involved with preventing conditions 
whose medical expenses are themselves covered by insurance.\6\ Moral 
hazard may also result in drug misuse and health harms, as it did with 
opioid prescriptions (Council of Economic Advisers April 2019), or in 
fraud and improper payments. With the stakes so high, identifying 
business models that would permit better utilization and lower cost 
could have tremendous value.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ Moral hazard refers to the distorted incentives that come with 
``spending other people's money'' (Klick and Stratmann 2007). See also 
Burns' (2022, p. 603) description of the ``implementation of outcome-
based contracts requir[ing] significant investments in infrastructure 
(data collection and analytics capabilities).'' The Food and Drug 
Administration (2020) cites the lack of financial incentives and 
quality management systems as two of the ``root causes'' of drug 
shortages.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why patients and plan sponsors seek a managed benefit
    Drug insurance plan sponsors understand that it is wasteful--
requiring premiums that are too high to attract members--to have third-
party payment and leave the benefit unmanaged. Pharmacy benefit 
management services (PBM services) is the industry term for the 
management of patient utilization, processing of prescription drug 
claims, and negotiating plan savings from other actors in the 
healthcare supply chain. A PBM is a company that specializes in 
providing PBM services on behalf of plan sponsors. The services include 
plan design features such as allocating drugs to different copay tiers 
or requiring plan authorization prior to patient access, drug 
utilization reviews that help improve drug effectiveness and prevent 
adverse drug reactions, obtaining rebates and discounts from those 
providers whose sales are increased by the plan, and managing specialty 
drugs. PBM services thereby expand the economic pie in prescription 
markets.
    PBM services also redistribute from manufacturers and pharmacies to 
consumers as negotiations and plan design fuel competition that lowers 
net retail and manufacturing prices. PBMs ultimately, if not 
intentionally, encourage drug innovation by increasing utilization 
early in a drug's patent life where sales are most important in terms 
of creating a financial return. By saving governments money and thereby 
limiting their need to increase distortionary taxes, PBM services also 
benefit the wider economy.
    Perhaps public policy changes could increase competition among drug 
manufacturers and among retail pharmacies. But until that happens, 
competition can still be enhanced by group purchasing and negotiated 
discounts. PBMs do exactly that, in some of the same ways that Costco, 
Sam's Club, and other buyers' clubs obtain manufacturer discounts on 
behalf of their members.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ Costco is a buyers' club for a range of consumer products, 
including prescription drugs. Specifically, Costco owns the PBM Costco 
Health Solutions and is a partial owner of another PBM (Navitus).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Buyers' clubs induce sellers to limit their exercise of market 
power by presenting them with a more price-elastic demand curve (Jaffe, 
et al., 2019). The members of Costco may not have a particularly price-
elastic demand for particular brands of, say, skateboards. Skateboard 
manufacturers know this and hike their prices when dealing with 
consumers individually. But Costco limits the number of manufacturers 
who can sell to their members to one or two manufacturers pricing the 
lowest. In effect, each manufacturer bidding to be in Costco faces a 
very price-elastic demand from the club because a small increase in 
price will cost them all sales through Costco. With a low price of 
skateboards in the store, Costco members buy more skateboards than they 
would if there were no buyers' clubs in that market. Quantity discounts 
obtained by buyers' clubs serve much the same purpose (Murphy, Snyder 
and Topel 2014). Either way, lower prices and higher quantities are the 
proof that buyers' clubs are procompetitive.
    In much the same way that Costco excludes skateboard manufacturers 
and restaurants exclude soda vendors, PBMs can exclude manufacturers, 
or place a manufacturer's products less favorably in the plan, to 
incentivize the favored manufacturers to deliver drugs to plan members 
at a lower price. As Patricia M. Danzon put it, ``[t]he basic principle 
is that PBMs can drive discounts on drug prices and pharmacy fees by 
restricting patients' choice of drugs or pharmacies, thereby increasing 
volume for preferred suppliers that accept the discounted prices. Thus, 
more restrictive drug formularies or pharmacy networks generally obtain 
larger discounts.'' \8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ Danzon (2015, p. 246). See also FTC's (2014) conclusion that 
the ``ability of health plans to construct networks that include some, 
but not all, providers (so-called `selective contracting') has long 
been seen as an important to enhance competition and lower costs. . . 
.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Components of the value of management: utilization, drug innovation, 
        and taxpayer savings
    From the perspective of consumer demand, the first potential source 
of underutilization is the gap between list price and the marginal cost 
of producing, delivering, and administering the drug. This source is 
especially relevant for newer branded drugs that are still under patent 
and thereby available only from a single manufacturer, although other 
manufacturers may sell chemically different drugs that treat the same 
condition. It is also relevant for the purchase of retail pharmacy 
services. Economics has long noted that gaps between list price and 
marginal cost open opportunities for mutually advantageous trade 
between seller and buyers where the buyers receive a discount for 
purchasing more than they would at list price (Oi 1971, Telser 1994, 
Lakdawalla and Sood 2013). PBMs arrange such trades by (i) obtaining 
manufacturer rebates in exchange for placement in the plan's benefit 
structure that helps the manufacturer make additional sales to plan 
members and (ii) obtaining pharmacy discounts and higher-quality 
retailing in exchange for favorable pharmacy placement in drug plan 
pharmacy networks, which is valuable to the pharmacy due to the traffic 
it directs to the retail stores.
    To put it another way, benefit management improves drug utilization 
both as a condition of receiving manufacturer and pharmacy discounts 
and because of the reduced net prices.\9\ Reduced net prices help plans 
reduce their premiums and enhance their benefits. Better utilization 
improves health, which itself reduces nondrug medical expenses 
(Lichtenberg 2007). Reduced premiums and medical expenses yield 
substantial government savings due to subsidies for health insurance 
premiums through Medicare and other government plans, the Affordable 
Care Act, and the exclusion of employer-plan premiums from income 
taxable by the personal income and payroll taxes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ The net manufacturer price refers to the difference between the 
manufacturer's list price and the discount or ``rebate'' paid by the 
manufacturer to PBM or plan sponsor. The net pharmacy price refers to 
the difference between the pharmacy's list price for retail services 
and the discount received by the PBM or plan sponsor from the pharmacy. 
As part of their task of reducing costs while encouraging proper 
utilization, PBMs also keep plans informed as to the availability of 
generics and encourage generic substitutes to be dispensed when they 
are appropriate and available. This is one reason why generic 
utilization rates are significantly greater in the U.S. than in Europe 
(Wouters, Kanavos and McKee 2017), where PBMs are much less common.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Because drug sales revenue is an essential motivation for private-
sector drug development and PBMs work to obtain reduced drug prices, 
drug development and PBM services would appear to be in conflict. 
However, additional utilization, and not just rebates, is also an 
outcome of plan-manufacturer negotiations. The relative importance of 
these two outcomes varies across drugs according to their age and 
characteristics. Manufacturers of unique new drugs--the drugs that add 
the most value--benefit from plan-manufacturer negotiations because of 
the additional utilization that occurs while paying a comparatively low 
rebate rate. In contrast, plans (or PBMs on their behalf) extract 
greater rebates from the manufacturers of older or ``me too'' drugs.
    Unique new drugs are a small fraction of all drugs, as evidenced by 
the fact that 90 percent of drugs dispensed are generics. Even among 
spending on branded drugs, only a fraction is on single-source drugs, 
which means that the patent has not yet expired. Even among those, many 
faced significant competition from manufacturers of alternative drugs 
treating the same condition (Lakdawalla and Li 2021). In this way PBM 
services reduce aggregate manufacturer revenue while increasing the 
revenue for the small fraction of drugs that are unique and new.
    The size of the utilization and net price effects of benefit 
management are interrelated quantitative questions. They can be 
assessed, as I have in two recent studies, from the empirical magnitude 
of rebates on branded drugs. Alternatively, the magnitude of branded 
rebates can be assessed from the fact that the generic substitution 
occurring after patent expiration results in no discernible increase in 
overall utilization (Lakdawalla and Philipson 2012). Both approaches 
similarly show that benefit management substantially increases drug 
utilization as it reduces net prices. On this basis, I conclude that 
pharmacy benefit management is worth at least $145 billion annually 
beyond its resource cost (Mulligan 2022).
Regulatory Impact Analysis
The risk-reward ratio: pharmacy DIR regulation
    The PBM Transparency Act of 2023 and other PBM regulations put some 
of these economic gains at risk by constraining the use of benefit-
management tools; discouraging investment in the capital assets that 
help manage utilization, claims, and other activities of drug plans; 
and creating barriers to further innovation and entry in the PBM 
business. In the likely case that large incumbent PBMs are better able 
to adapt to the regulations than smaller new PBMs are, the regulations 
would have the unintended consequence of reducing competition--growing 
large PBMs at the expense of smaller ones--while they increase the 
resource costs of managing pharmacy benefits. Even if a new regulation 
eliminated only 10 percent of the value of benefit management--
something like $14 billion annually--it would not pass a cost-benefit 
test unless it also resulted in a commensurate regulatory benefit.
    The PBM Transparency Act of 2023 includes provisions related to 
pharmacy direct and indirect remuneration (DIR), spread pricing (PBMs 
charge plans a different drug price than they pay to manufacturers), 
and mandatory disclosure of the terms of contracts that PBMs negotiate 
with manufacturers or pharmacies.\10\ Section 2 of the Act specifically 
would give PBMs two compliance options: one option requiring PBMs to 
publicly disclose their remuneration and prohibiting them from 
retaining any of the discounts paid by manufacturers and pharmacies and 
another option prohibiting (among other things) pharmacy DIR that is 
obtained ``arbitrarily, unfairly, or deceptively.'' Because it remains 
to be seen how these terms would be interpreted and which of the two 
compliance options would be chosen by PBMs, I estimate the net 
(monetary and opportunity) cost of Section 2 for a couple of different 
scenarios.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ As negotiated by PBMs on behalf of their client plans, 
pharmacies receive funds from the plans up front--at the point of 
sale--for dispensing prescriptions and conducting drug-adherence 
programs. After the point of sale, payment adjustments are made and 
pharmacies return some of the funds to the extent that performance 
metrics were not met during the year. These various post-sale fees and 
settlement payments from pharmacies to plans and PBMs are known in the 
Medicare Part D program as pharmacy direct and indirect remuneration, 
or ``pharmacy DIR.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    One scenario is that a significant number of PBMs choose the 
pharmacy DIR restriction, which results in a reduction in the discounts 
provided by retail pharmacies. Pharmacies are potentially more 
profitable, but a far greater combined cost is imposed on patients, 
plans, manufacturers, and ultimately taxpayers. The chart below shows 
the net costs separately by type of market participant, expressed per 
dollar of pharmacy benefit.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Restrictions on pharmacy DIR reduce drug utilization directly 
because pharmacy DIR is an essential tool for incentivizing pharmacies, 
which are more proximate to patients than manufacturers or PBMs are, to 
help plans achieve adherence goals. The restrictions also reduce drug 
utilization indirectly by increasing the net price of retail pharmacy 
services, which are an essential part of the drug supply chain. 
Therefore, while DIR restrictions are expected to allow pharmacies to 
charge more for their retail services and spend less pursuing plans' 
management goals, these advantages accrue to fewer scripts due to the 
lower utilization. The redistribution from patient and plan to pharmacy 
has a side effect of lost opportunities from productive partnerships 
between pharmacy and plans.
    As patients utilize less while net prices are higher (pharmacy 
charges apply to both brands and generics), pharmacy DIR regulation 
increases premiums for both drug plans and nondrug medical plans due to 
the additional medical costs that come with reduced drug adherence. 
Taxpayers--that is workers and savers who pay income and payroll 
taxes--are responsible for much of the added premium. They too miss 
valuable opportunities as they struggle to adapt to a greater tax 
burden, which is why the chart also shows a comparatively large burden 
on workers and savers.\11\ Overall, pharmacy DIR proves to be a 
particularly oblique way of adding to pharmacy profits as patients, 
plans, and others ultimately pay more than $6 for each $1 of pharmacy 
benefit. If all PBMs adhered to this compliance option in the PBM 
Transparency Act of 2023 (rather than Section 2's detailed disclosure 
and other requirements), pharmacies would gain one or two billion 
dollars annually at an annual cost of nine or ten billion to the rest 
of the market and wider economy. In this scenario, the Act would add 
between $8 billion and $11 billion to the Federal deficit every year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ Of course, the fiscal effect of any one regulation is small on 
the scale of overall Federal taxes collected. Nevertheless, because 
taxpayers are numerous, the value of the lost opportunities in labor 
and capital markets is not small on the scale of that one regulation's 
other costs and benefits. See also CEA (March 2019, Chapter 2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The risk-reward ratio: disclosure requirements
    At last year's hearing, and elsewhere, it is alleged that (i) 
excess PBM profits increase drug costs and (ii) disclosure requirements 
would reduce drug costs by reducing excess PBM profits. Even if (i) 
were correct, (ii) does not necessarily follow because disclosure 
requirements could have unintended consequences that increase drug 
costs and perhaps even create excess PBM profits. A quantitative 
economic model such as that provided in Mulligan (2022, 2023) helps 
identify some of the unintended consequences and to assess their 
magnitude as compared to the intended benefits of the disclosures that 
would be mandated by the PBM Transparency Act of 2023.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\ Section 2 specifically requires, as a compliance alternative 
to the aforementioned pharmacy DIR requirements, that the ``pharmacy 
benefit manager, affiliate, subsidiary, or agent provides full and 
complete disclosure of--(A) the cost, price, and reimbursement of the 
prescription drug to each health plan, payer, and pharmacy with which 
the pharmacy benefit manager, affiliate, subsidiary, or agent has a 
contract or agreement to provide pharmacy benefit management services; 
(B) each fee, markup, and discount charged or imposed by the pharmacy 
benefit manager, affiliate, subsidiary, or agent to each health plan, 
payer, and pharmacy with which the pharmacy benefit manager, affiliate, 
subsidiary, or agent has a contract or agreement for pharmacy benefit 
management services; or (C) the aggregate amount of all remuneration 
the pharmacy benefit manager receives from a prescription drug 
manufacturer for a prescription drug, including any rebate, discount, 
administration fee, and any other payment or credit obtained or 
retained by the pharmacy benefit manager, or affiliate, subsidiary, or 
agent of the pharmacy benefit manager, pursuant to a contract or 
agreement for pharmacy benefit management services to a health plan, 
payer, or any Federal agency (upon the request of the agency).''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Mandatory disclosure may, among other things, hinder investment and 
innovation in benefit management.\13\ One of the major intended (and 
procompetitive) results of a managed insurance benefit is to maintain 
different prices of products and services produced by monopolistic or 
oligopolistic manufacturers and pharmacies (Lakdawalla and Sood 2013). 
Because the systems for doing so are intellectual property that is 
rarely protected by patent or copyright, disclosure of proprietary 
information about those systems would remove much of the financial 
incentive to invest in advancing them because competitors could use the 
disclosed information to more rapidly imitate. Unlike other areas of 
healthcare where the product is a chemical, procedure, or device, much 
of the product of benefit management is the pricing and other contract 
provisions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ Burns (2022, Chapter 10) provides a history of PBM 
innovations. Burns points out (p. 603) that, among other investments, 
``implementation of outcome-based contracts requires significant 
investments in infrastructure (data collection and analytics 
capabilities).''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unintended effects on investment and innovation may explain why, 
despite the presence of multiple PBMs as well as several other large 
companies in a position to enter the PBM business, voluntary full 
disclosure is, so far, hardly passing the market test.\14\ If voluntary 
disclosure ultimately succeeds, then perhaps government mandates are 
not needed. Otherwise, plan-sponsor choices reveal that most of them 
assess the costs of publicly disclosed benefit management parameters to 
exceed the benefits.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \14\ Economics conceptually distinguishes disclosure from simple 
pricing, whereas some of the new PBM entrants have tied them together 
in practice. Lakadawalla and Sood (2013) and others find that 
complicated pricing provides substantial value in terms of high levels 
of utilization of unique drugs that are still under patent. Complicated 
pricing also helps to align incentives of various market participants 
(e.g., financially aligning pharmacies with a plan sponsor's adherence 
goals). Whether the complicated pricing remains propriety information 
is a different question that is the topic of Sections 2 and 4 of the 
PBM Transparency Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The annual costs of PBMs are about $21 billion, of which about $7 
billion is accounting profit (Sood, et al., 2017). Because much of the 
accounting profit of PBMs is a competitive return on the capital 
essential for managing benefits, any public policy that succeeded in 
reducing PBM profits through enhanced competition would at best be 
reducing annual profits by $1 or $2 billion in a $350 billion 
prescription market.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \15\ Some public policies that reduce profits also make consumers 
pay more because the policies create costs that are partly passed on to 
consumers. Making it more difficult for PBMs to do business may 
discourage companies from getting into the PBM business.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Disclosure requirements like this may stifle competition among 
manufacturers, among pharmacies, and among PBMs. On the first point, 
public disclosure of PBM contracts could facilitate collusion because 
the disclosure would allow competing manufacturers to know, in a more 
timely fashion, the amount of rebates that competing manufacturers were 
offering. In the context of disclosure of health care contract data, 
the Federal Trade Commission (2015) warned that ``[w]hile 
[transparency] laws can be procompetitive, [they] may require public 
health plans to publicly disclose competitively sensitive information, 
including information related to price and cost. Such disclosure may 
chill competition by facilitating or increasing the likelihood of 
unlawful collusion, and may also undermine the effectiveness of 
selective contracting by health plans. . . .'' \16\ The two anti-
competitive concerns cited by the FTC are relevant to the PBM 
Transparency Act of 2023, because the Act specifically targets ``cost, 
price and reimbursement'' for disclosure and because selective 
contracting is an essential tool for pharmacy benefit management. 
Moreover, both the Department of Justice and the FTC (1996) note that 
the anti-competitive effects are especially likely when data is 
disclosed for individual sellers or that aggregate data is disclosed 
for which an individual seller contributes more than 25 percent to the 
aggregate. These are exactly the disclosure conditions set forth by 
Section 2 of the PBM Transparency Act.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\ Emphasis added. The Minnesota Department of Human Services 
(2015) also concluded that ``classifying plan-provider contracts as 
public data would offer little benefit but could pose substantial risk 
of reducing competition in health care markets. Such disclosure may 
reduce the incentive for all providers to offer low prices and may 
facilitate collusion among providers. High levels of market 
concentration . . . would facilitate these outcomes.''
    \17\ These conditions may also be set forth by Section 4 of the PBM 
Transparency Act, depending on if and how the disclosed data is 
presented to the public or to competitors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Consider, for example, three branded therapies competing. Absent 
disclosures, one pays a 20 percent rebate, a second pays 30 percent, 
and a third pays 40 percent. The second and third understand that they 
are rebating more than another competitor but are unaware that the gap 
from the more expensive competitor is a full 10 percentage points. As 
full disclosure reveals the gaps, the second reduces its rebate to 21 
percent while the third reduces to 22 percent. In other words, full 
disclosure reduces the average rebate from 30 percent to 21 percent.
    I estimate that the annual net costs of reducing brand competition 
in this way would be more than $25 billion, which already nets out the 
extra profits for brand manufacturers. About $40 billion would be added 
to the deficit annually as the Federal government spends more and sees 
its income tax base reduced as drug plan premiums increase.\18\ A 
similar reduction in competition among pharmacies would have net costs 
of $8 billion per year. Reducing competition among PBMs, even if 
unintentional, could cost up to $48 billion per year. These are the 
risks of disclosure to be weighed against a potential reward of 
transferring one or two billion dollars annually from PBMs to other 
market participants.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \18\ An analogy is the 2020 rebate rule (84 FR 2340), which the 
Congressional Budget Office (2019) and the Office of the Actuary of the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (84 FR 2360) separately 
projected to add about $20 billion to the annual deficit, even though 
that rule would not apply to the commercial segment, whereas the 
Transparency Act would apply to all segments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusions
    Manufacturers and pharmacies sometimes refer to dedicated pharmacy 
benefit management companies (PBMs) as ``middlemen'' as if the PBMs 
were supply-chain toll collectors performing no legitimate economic 
function.\19\ Insurance-plan sponsors--including state and Federal 
governments in their roles as plan sponsors--do not agree. In pursuit 
of better value for their members, plans consistently retain PBMs to 
help design their benefit, negotiate prices, and process claims. In 
several instances plans have launched their own PBMs to service plan 
members. Leaving the drug benefit unmanaged would be expensive and 
wasteful, even if it did partially relieve manufacturers and pharmacies 
of competitive pressures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \19\ Wilson (2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To be clear, neither PBMs nor their client plan sponsors invent or 
manufacture drugs or dispense them to patients. Their important effects 
on utilization and costs operate through the marketplace, especially as 
they help coordinate the various supply chain actors to discover and 
realize mutually beneficial gains from trade. Predicting effects of PBM 
regulations requires expertise on the operations of markets, from 
inventor and manufacturer through to the final consumer. Among the 
testimony you are hearing today, mine is unique in reflecting market 
level analysis, incorporating the various components of both supply and 
demand. None of the others is offering or relying upon an open-source 
quantitative market model of PBM regulation, which allows rigorous and 
transparent assessment of the tradeoffs and unintended consequences 
inherent in regulatory policy.
    The PBM Transparency Act of 2023 is more of an economic regulation 
than a healthcare regulation. It would restrict pricing in business-to-
business transactions and require disclosure of proprietary 
information. This by itself does not say whether the Act would have net 
benefits or net costs, but particularly the price controls are a 
warning that the unintended consequences may be numerous and 
profound.\20\ I estimate that the pharmacy DIR restrictions in Section 
2 would cost patients, plans, and others more than $6 for every $1 of 
benefit provided to pharmacies. I estimate that disclosure requirements 
could impose tens of billions of dollars in annual net costs by 
discouraging competition among manufacturers, among pharmacies, and 
among PBMs. Ten billion dollars, and perhaps much more, would be added 
to the annual Federal deficit by the PBM Transparency Act of 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \20\ The Federal government's Executive Branch acknowledges the 
high regulatory risk-reward ratio for price regulations in the Office 
of Management and Budget's (2003) Circular A-4. A-4 notes that imposing 
price regulations would, ``in light of both economic theory and actual 
experience,'' require a ``particularly demanding burden of proof.''

    The Chair. Thank you very much. I am--I am reminded this 
morning of a time when we had a similar issue, derivatives, and 
one of our colleagues on the Senate floor said we cannot 
regulate derivatives, we do not understand them, and then 
shortly thereafter, our whole U.S. economy blew up. So I 
guarantee you we can look at this market, and we can understand 
what is going on, and we certainly can benefit from more 
transparency.
    Since I served on the Judiciary Committee for a short 
period of time and then started this work on Senator Grassley, 
we were able, in the Affordable Care Act, to give CMS and the 
Department of Justice the ability to look at these numbers 
without disclosing them. And it is that kind of policing in the 
market that we expect people to do so that consumers, from the 
vertical integration that has happened, do not suffer from the 
concentration.
    So I love the Costco model. In fact, I am trying to drive 
it into some other healthcare decisionmaking because if you buy 
in bulk, yes, you should get a discount. The question here is, 
who is getting the discount? Is the consumer getting the 
discount, or are the very manufacturers who own the PBMs 
getting the discount and pocketing it? And when we looked at 
this issue when it was Merck Medco, that is exactly what was 
happening. People were negotiating with King County and a union 
just like you discussed, and saying, OK, we negotiated a 35-
percent discount. They gave the union 5 percent of the 
discount, and the company and the drug manufacturer pocketed 
the 35 percent, the very people who owned the drug. So these 
are the practices that are driving Americans crazy, and they 
want some transparency.
    So I want to go back to you, Dr. Trish, since you are the 
resident expert here on the long study of this. What has 
changed? All the witnesses mentioned the vertical integration, 
so what has happened here is fewer people own the ability to 
create competition and buy the price. So I want you to explain 
what has changed over the last decade about that that has 
allowed this concentration of power. And then, if you could, 
also explain why this discount is not being passed on, and why 
now it is squeezing Dr. Oftebro because he has no recourse. 
He's a buyer. He's buying the drugs, but then he's not getting 
reimbursed for the price of the drug. So that is what is going 
on here. So why has this market power and concentration been 
accelerated over the last whatever period of time it is? I am 
saying it is 10 years, but maybe it is shorter or longer. I do 
not know.
    Dr. Trish. Absolutely. So if you look at the history, what 
we have seen is a considerable degree of integration in this 
industry where PBMs are no longer freestanding entities, but 
instead they--all of the three biggest PBMs are integrated, are 
owned by a health plan, a health insurer. Many of them also own 
or have a footprint in the pharmacy market, or at least in the 
specialty pharmacy market, and some in the healthcare provider 
market as well. And so that is now an entrenched set of 
incentives where they can, you know, have an incentive to 
essentially steer funds to themselves preferentially over to 
other independent pharmacies or other examples like that.
    So if you look at the world where--you know, there are 
certainly examples where vertical integration can improve the 
way that markets function, but it also raises questions about 
incentives, right? And so if you are a PBM that is integrated, 
or affiliated, or owned by a health insurer, and you are 
thinking about do I want to preferentially have my contract 
benefit my health insurer relative to the other health insurers 
in the market, you know, that is the type of question that we 
need to better study. Likewise, if you own the pharmacy or a 
set of pharmacies, and you want to have more favorable 
reimbursement terms to the pharmacies that you own or that are 
affiliated with, or steer the business there, that can harm the 
independent pharmacies that are not affiliated. And that is 
exactly the type of contract structure that we need more 
insight into to understand how this is playing out in the 
market.
    The Chair. Well, I definitely do not want a concentration 
of power, and then there are some--and there are some, who are 
even these companies, who do not even want--they just want all 
mail order. That is what they want, and I could tell you, I 
believe in the pharmacists. I believe in the interaction that 
they have with the patient. I believe that it is a consult that 
is valuable to keep in our community.
    So with that aside, it is the consumer who is not getting 
the discount. If you are buying on my behalf, whether it is a 
plan for, you know, the U.S. Government, a county or a 
business, I am hearing complaints now from big businesses in my 
state who are saying I--these people are cornering the market. 
It is affecting big employer plans, because they are doing the 
same thing. They have that much concentration of power. So we 
have no transparency onto what discount. Do you have any idea 
what kind of discounts are being driven? Do you have an idea 
about what percentages?
    Dr. Trish. So what we do know, I can tell from the work 
that--especially in the insulin space where there is a bit more 
transparency of things to some of the State efforts and other 
things that have happened. What we have seen is that over time, 
PBMs have, in fact, been effective at lowering the net--the net 
prices that those insulin manufacturers are receiving, but 
that, as you just described, is not the price that we as people 
or patients actually care about. What we care about is how much 
we are spending on these products. And the research that we 
showed--that we have done has shown that that has roughly been 
flat over time, but the--what is happening is the share of 
those dollars that are going to the supply chain have increased 
rather than the dollars that are going to manufacturers, but 
you are right, that the consumers themselves are not 
benefiting.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Welcome to each of 
the witnesses. Thank you for being here, Dr. Patt. Always good 
to see a fellow Texan. Welcome to D.C. I'll note, Chairwoman 
Cantwell observed that all four of our witnesses are doctors. 
It reminds me of the scene from the classic comedy ``Spies Like 
Us,'' doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor, so welcome, doctors.
    Dr. Mulligan, no one wants higher drug prices, and I think 
we need to look for creative solutions to lower them, but with 
every legislative solution, we got to consider the tradeoffs, 
especially when our solution is to grant additional authority 
to a government agency to regulate a particular market. 
Government regulation can create substantial compliance costs. 
It can also create barriers to entry for competitors in their 
market. This bill imposes both contractual disclosure 
requirements, meaning it tells PBMs they must share data on how 
much they pay providers and manufacturers for each drug, and it 
also prohibits things like clawbacks and spread pricing.
    Dr. Mulligan, one argument for the bill is that there is 
too much consolidation among PBMs right now. We have heard that 
argument made this morning. In your analysis of the bill, could 
the bill's requirement lead to more or less market 
consolidation of PBMs?
    Dr. Mulligan. It could lead to more----
    Senator Cruz. Please turn your microphone on.
    Dr. Mulligan. It could lead to more. We doctors maybe 
should try not to do no harm. Regulations generally, they 
disproportionately burden the small businesses, and this bill 
does not have any exemption for smaller businesses. And the 
vertical integration that has been described is especially 
problematic with respect to this bill because the requirements 
are going to be telling the bigger PBMs how much does your left 
hand pay to your right hand? Well, they can just answer that 
any way that pleases the FTC. It does not really matter. What 
is going to matter is for the smaller companies.
    Senator Cruz. So I want to follow up on the question. So 
you are saying it would be beneficial, if you want to avoid 
market consolidation, for the bill to have some sort of 
exemption for smaller PBMs. Is that----
    Dr. Mulligan. It would be better not to have the bill, but 
the bill with an exemption for smaller businesses, like we do 
with so many other regulations, would be an improvement.
    Senator Cruz. OK. That is--that is--that is helpful. If 
this bill was enacted into law, based on your economic 
analysis, how would it impact drug prices for the average 
American?
    Dr. Mulligan. How would--300-million-plus Americans are on 
insurance, and insurance companies, they are the benefit 
managers or they hire people to do the benefit management for 
them. That is what they want. They want lower prices and better 
utilization, and you are undermining that activity, and so drug 
prices will go up. I estimate just the pharmacy part alone 
could add to premiums about $10 billion a year in aggregate.
    Senator Cruz. So explain how that is for someone at home 
who is watching this. Look, we have all been in a situation 
where you are paying too much, you are frustrated, you are 
dealing with the bureaucracy, and it pisses you off. Explain 
what you believe would be the negative consequences of this 
bill for a consumer at home that wants high-quality healthcare, 
high-quality pharmaceuticals at an affordable price. If I 
understand you correctly, you are concerned this bill would be 
counterproductive for that.
    Dr. Mulligan. That is right, and we have pharmacy companies 
and manufacturers who have market power, and the best way 
consumers will be able to deal with that is to join these 
buyers' clubs, like they do with Costco. And now you are going 
to undermine the one tool they have had to try to create some 
competition in that space by burdening the very companies 
that--whose job it is and who have successfully gotten lower 
prices for the consumers.
    Senator Cruz. So if you are correct that this bill would 
hurt patients by driving up costs, typically when one group is 
being hurt in the economy, somebody else is doing better. So if 
consumers would lose money, who would get the money? Who makes 
out well under this bill?
    Dr. Mulligan. Well, it is not a zero sum game, so the 
winners actually gain less than the losers from this bill, but 
the winners are the manufacturers. There would be lots of 
competition among manufacturers. They would----
    Senator Cruz. So like Big Pharma.
    Dr. Mulligan. Big Pharma and the pharmacy companies.
    Senator Cruz. So your testimony is this bill benefits Big 
Pharma and allows them to make more money. Is that right?
    Dr. Mulligan. Yes, and the report I put in the record has a 
numerical estimate of--to that effect, yes.
    Senator Cruz. And based on your analysis of the 
legislation, what do you calculate would be the additional 
costs to the Federal Government if this bill passed?
    Dr. Mulligan. I still have to see how Chairwoman Khan 
interprets some of these words in the bill, but easily $10 
billion a year to the Federal deficit, maybe $40 billion a 
year, maybe more.
    Senator Cruz. So over 10 years, you are talking somewhere 
between $100 billion to $400 billion in costs to the taxpayers?
    Dr. Mulligan. Yes, it is in the ballpark of that rebate 
rule that was scored by OACT and CBO.
    Senator Cruz. Wow. OK. Thank you, sir.
    The Chair. Senator Welch. Oh, OK.

                STATEMENT OF HON. PETER WELCH, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM VERMONT

    Senator Welch. Thank you very much. Where is it? Right 
here. Thank you. I want to talk about the impact of PBMs. We 
have a real crisis in Vermont with the pressure on local 
pharmacies. In my view, local pharmacies are absolutely 
essential to the delivery of quality healthcare. In my 
experience, and it includes personal experience, a physician 
will give you a prescription, and everybody's prescription is 
not necessarily how it ultimately has to be. And the capacity 
of a patient to go into a local pharmacy where there is some 
trust and knowledge and have that physician be--or, pardon me, 
that local pharmacist be able to essentially talk through what 
some of the reactions are and help that person get the 
medication utilization that is actually the maximum benefit, is 
really essential to the well-being of the patient.
    And we have got a healthcare system that is just crushing 
primary delivery people in it, and they are the most essential 
in it. And the local pharmacies with the PBMs are having 
inflicted on them something that is truly astonishing in a 
capitalist economy, and that is, they are allowed to sell it at 
price X, and 3 months later they get a clawback saying you owe 
us money. How in the--how in the world is that fair? Seriously. 
How in the world is that fair? And it is not just that it is a 
rip-off for the local pharmacist. It is crushing the capacity 
of those folks who care about the people in their community to 
be able to help the fellow citizens in their community. And it 
is just flat-out wrong.
    So Senator Tester and I are working on something to try to 
protect our local pharmacies, and that is because we think 
those people are doing work that our--the folks we represent 
really, really need. So I'll ask each of you, how do we end 
this clawback? It is totally, completely unjustified and 
unfair, and we will just go down the line and people can tell 
me, are you for it or you against it?
    Dr. Oftebro. Thank you, Senator Welch. As an independent 
pharmacist, I am against it because it is causing real harm. 
These fees are totally unpredictable and make it completely 
impossible to run a sustainable business.
    Senator Welch. Right. Let other people do it, but thank you 
for your good work.
    Dr. Patt. So I concur. I think that DIR fees are not 
meaningful measures of quality. They have grown, from around 7 
years ago, 4 percent of total costs to over 11 percent of total 
costs in our pharmacy today, and they are not anchored on any 
measure of quality. So if they were truly quality clawbacks, 
then I think that it would make sense, but, again, in my 
practice, it would measure things like have you had your 
hypertensive medications filled by our pharmacy. Have you had 
our cholesterol medications filled, and have you filled your 
oral oncolytics every 30 days?
    Senator Welch. You are giving me a headache. You have to 
deal with that?
    Dr. Patt. Well, and so as a cancer specialist, frequently I 
hold medication because of toxicity to make sure patients can--
--
    Senator Welch. Right.
    Dr. Patt.--remain adherent and benefit from therapy. So I 
would say actually they facilitate poorer quality----
    Senator Welch. Right.
    Dr. Patt.--in the patients we serve, and they are anchored 
on unmeaningful measures. The other thing is, I think that you 
cannot just say DIR fees go away and it has one effect on the 
economics of the healthcare ecosystem because what happens is 
wholesale acquisition cost changes as DIR fees change, and so 
we would anticipate that the market reacts. But DIR fees 
clearly are not a measure of quality, and they diminish the 
ability for a pharmacist----
    Senator Welch. Thank you.
    Dr. Patt.--to do meaningful work.
    Senator Welch. Thank you very much.
    Dr. Trish. Thank you. I am a health economist but sit in 
the School of Pharmacy at USC, so very much appreciate and have 
that firsthand experience of the important role that 
pharmacists play in our healthcare system.
    I think, you know, I actually agree with Professor Mulligan 
that PBMs do need tools to effectively negotiate, right, that 
we do want the--our healthcare system to reflect the value of 
those negotiations. But when that happens in a highly opaque 
and complex market where PBMs are the one holding the 
information and initiating many of these fees after the fact in 
somewhat arbitrary or confusing or--in ways that, you know, as 
we have just heard, do not necessarily even reflect value, that 
is a concern, and that is a problem.
    Senator Welch. Thank you. Thank you very much.
    Dr. Mulligan. I am a technocrat.
    Senator Welch. My time is up.
    Dr. Mulligan. And technocrats are the last ones that should 
be asked to--asked to--what policies should be. We can tell you 
about the tradeoffs in elected officials. Now I will remind you 
of some of the tradeoffs, and it is--we practice this in the 
executive branch, that you are talking about regulating 
contracts, price controls. These can have side effects, 
unintended consequences that are--that are pretty bad, and so 
at least we need to do the due diligence around what the 
tradeoffs are.
    And one of the tradeoffs are, if you are going to regulate 
contracts between pharmacies and other businesses, then that 
means that those businesses are going to tend to merge, and you 
are going to have, as Senator Cruz and I were discussing, 
you'll tend to favor the big guys.
    The Chair. Dr. Mulligan, we have to--we have to move on, 
but I will----
    Senator Welch. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The Chair.--I will--I will send Senator Grassley to talk to 
you about that because I am pretty sure he does not agree with 
your interpretation. Neither do I, but I think, more 
importantly, let us--let us have him talk to you why he wanted 
the legislation designed this way. We do not think it is 
setting a price. It is taking activities that we think are 
unlawful in how they are acting. No one thinks spread pricing 
or clawbacks are the way to make the market function.
    OK, we are to Senator--let us see. Senator Budd is here. 
Senator Budd.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED BUDD, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA

    Senator Budd. Thank you, Chair. So I have had two--I have 
heard directly from patients in North Carolina. They cannot 
afford the medications that they need. The cost of drugs 
covered by Medicare grew at a rate faster than inflation. You 
know, it is serious for families that are struggling to keep up 
with the rising cost of grocery, utilities, seniors living on 
fixed incomes. So pharmacy benefit managers were created to 
negotiate drug prices and address these costs. There are 
concerns that patients are not seeing the savings that get 
negotiated.
    Now, the healthcare industry is complex. We need to examine 
what is causing this cost increase and consider ways to bring 
more transparency to the drug supply chain. So, Dr. Oftebro, 
you discussed how PBMs retroactively claw back fees and 
reimbursement dollars from the pharmacy after a patient picks 
up a prescription and the pharmacy has paid for its service. 
Now, can you explain how this impacts your ability to provide 
care to patients?
    Dr. Oftebro. Well, we have to close our pharmacies.
    Senator Budd. Can you--can you talk a little bit about the 
basic economics that would--that would lead to that?
    Dr. Oftebro. Well, so we have no say in whether or not we 
incur these fees. We have no negotiation ability in these 
contracts. And so, when we are presented with these fees, they 
are clawed back, and it impacts our operating budget. We are 
not able to hire staff. We cannot afford to have pharmacists to 
provide these additional services, and we ultimately need to 
close our doors.
    Senator Budd. You shared that the vertical integration in 
the drug supply chain creates conflicts of interest. I think 
massive conflicts of interest is what you said. Can you expand 
on how that creates that conflict of interest?
    Dr. Oftebro. Yes. One of our other pharmacy practices in 
downtown Seattle serves a large population of patients living 
with HIV. We dispense a lot of HIV medications. One of the 
large PBMs sent us a letter and said that they were going to 
move all of our--all of the HIV medications into a specialty 
category, and that if we wanted to continue to be able to 
dispense these medications, we would need to seek third-party 
accreditation, pay the PBM thousands of dollars in fees. We 
would have to leave our PSAO, which is the entity that helps 
negotiate contracts on behalf of independent pharmacies, and 
sign a direct contract with the PBM. We had to do all of those 
things before they would show us a contract.
    Because this was such a crucial service to a vulnerable 
patient population, we had no choice, and when we received that 
contract, it was a significantly lower reimbursing contract. We 
lose hundreds of dollars on every fill of these HIV medications 
that they would prefer to steer into their own specialty 
pharmacy. There is a study out of the state of Florida by three 
access advisors that demonstrates that in those situations, 
those PBM-owned specialty pharmacies are actually charging more 
for those medications than when they are paid for in the 
independent pharmacies.
    Senator Budd. Thank you. Dr. Trish, you mentioned in your 
written testimony that there is evidence to suggest that PBMs 
favor high list price drugs, but you also noted that this is 
hard to prove definitively without access to rebate data. Could 
you share more about what it is from data that is needed to 
complete the picture and whether that data is proprietary?
    Dr. Trish. Yes, absolutely. So it just--these are 
considered confidential. You know, trade secrets are a part of 
the industry. So unlike, for example, in the world of 
physicians and hospitals where it is the case that insurers 
negotiate networks of providers, and we have the same dynamic 
where you are trying to, you know, essentially extract a lower 
price in exchange for an expectation of higher volume, in that 
world, we know what those prices are, right?
    When I pay my cost sharing, it is based off that negotiated 
price, not what the hospital is charging, but the actual 
negotiated price. And the--we know that the amount that the 
health insurer is paying to the physician is the--is the same 
as what they are turn--turning around and charging to the 
employer, right, that there is no spread or difference there. 
In the PBM world, it is the opposite. All of that is kept in 
secrecy and is very complex and very hard to understand, the 
way that this is actually playing out.
    Senator Budd. Thank you, and my time is short, but, Dr. 
Mulligan, ``yes'' or ``no,'' do you think that adding rebate 
data to the analysis of rising drug costs would be tapping into 
proprietary information?
    Dr. Mulligan. Yes.
    Senator Budd. Thank you. So I appreciate you all taking 
time to share your insights, and I look forward to continuing 
to examine the cause of rising drug prices and take the 
appropriate steps to solve this problem. Thank you. I yield 
back.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Budd. Senator Tester.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Senator Tester. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I want to thank 
you and the Ranking Member for having this hearing. I think it 
is a really important hearing.
    I got to be honest with you. The way I see the situation on 
PBMs is I do not know why the hell they even exist. Now, they 
were set up for all the right reasons: going to negotiate drug 
prices, going to pass along benefits to the consumer. But what 
I see them doing in my state, I do not think the consumer gets 
much benefit, and they are shutting down small businesses on 
Main Street right and left, and those are called our local 
neighborhood pharmacies. So as far as holding the big 
pharmaceutical companies accountable, I do not see it, and the 
reason I do not see it is because there is no transparency in 
PBMs. None. Zero. Nada. Kaput. Nothing. And quite frankly, when 
you combine that with anticompetitive tactics, this is a recipe 
where the only people that win in healthcare costs are the 
PBMs.
    So, Mr. Oftebro, tell me about some of the anticompetitive 
tactics that PBMs are using to squeeze small pharmacies like 
yours, like the one we have in my hometown, population 600, and 
how they are pushing you out of their network and limiting your 
abilities as a rural community provider?
    Dr. Oftebro. Thank you, Senator Tester. Yes, as I stated 
earlier, you know, we see every day patient steering, whether 
it is the use of the specialty category of medications that 
will steer patients into PBM-owned mail order pharmacies, 
mandatory mail order practices, just the way that we are forced 
to contract with PBMs where we have absolutely zero negotiating 
power. These are take-it-or-leave-it contracts, and the terms 
and conditions are totally unbearable. The fees that I 
described, both the DIR and the GER, and the ones that they 
haven't even invented yet, they are--they are impossible to 
predict, and it--and it makes it impossible to provide the 
level of care that our communities deserve.
    Senator Tester. So do you have--do you have any sort of 
numbers or metrics on how much of the drugs that go out your 
shop's doors are drugs that are impacted by PBMs?
    Dr. Oftebro. Virtually all of them.
    Senator Tester. OK. So you get these practices and know 
fully well any small business or any business, no matter what 
it is, if you do not turn a profit, you do not stay open. And 
are they--would it be fair to say they are squeezing you to the 
point where your profitability is to a point where you are 
going to have to close your doors if we do not do something in 
Congress about this?
    Dr. Oftebro. In 2022, we closed our pharmacy in a--in the 
Eastlake neighborhood of Seattle. It is the only pharmacy in 
the neighborhood, and we closed it precisely because of these 
retroactive fees.
    Senator Tester. I am going to stay with you: spread 
pricing. I am interested, when charging for a common generic 
drug, antibiotics, you know, the list is long. Let us say we 
have a little pharmacy in Big Sandy, Montana, and the PBM 
reimburses a diabetes medication for $10. How much does the PBM 
then charge the insurer? Could you say? So they are paying you 
10 bucks.
    Dr. Oftebro. They are paying us 10----
    Senator Tester. What are they charging on the other side?
    Dr. Oftebro. I have no idea.
    Senator Tester. On generics.
    Dr. Oftebro. I have no idea.
    Senator Tester. OK. Would new transparency requirements, if 
they were implemented the way this bill intends, do you think 
that would put unduly burdens on you as an independent 
pharmacy?
    Dr. Oftebro. Would PBM transparency put a burden on small 
pharmacies?
    Senator Tester. The new--yes, correct.
    Dr. Oftebro. I do not believe it would put any burden on 
us, unless of course, the PBM uses it as a reason to extract 
more from pharmacies.
    Senator Tester. Which is my next question. Do you think 
more transparency would make medications more profitable for 
the patient or less?
    Dr. Oftebro. It should make it less----
    Senator Tester. OK.
    Dr. Oftebro [continuing]. Less cost to the patient.
    Senator Tester. OK. I have got to tell you, I--as these 
were first set up, I am sure they were set up for the best of 
reasons. But anytime you have a situation where these guys can 
go do what they want, and a lot of the big PBMs are owned by 
insurance companies, I do not see where the patient is getting 
the benefit. In fact, I see where this has it--these PBMs have 
a tremendous potential for further drying up rural America, and 
we need to be focused on a lot of these rural areas when it 
comes to healthcare because it is not like driving 2 blocks 
down the street to see your doctor. It is more like driving 65 
or 100 miles one way to see that doc. And it is the same thing 
with small pharmacies. If you do not have one in your town, and 
we didn't have one in our town for a while, it makes healthcare 
much more complicated. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Tester. Senator Capito.

            STATEMENT OF HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

    Senator Capito. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you all 
for being here today at this very important hearing. So as I 
sit here and listen to this, and I voted for the bill when it 
came through committee last year, I believe, a couple things 
come to mind. So this is what would have been really helpful, I 
think, for everybody to bring: a flowchart that starts from the 
research of the drug to the person who actually gets it and 
what they pay for.
    So I made a little list myself. You have got the research, 
the manufacturing, the distributor, the PBM, the insurer, the 
doctor or hospital, the pharmacy, and then it gets to the 
patient. And I guarantee you, looking at a flowchart, if we 
looked--if we actually had that in front of us, it would be 
more difficult to read than a flowchart from the Corps of 
Engineers because it would be ``if this, that, ``if this, 
that,'' and before you know it, total confusion, which is what 
I think we have in terms of the lack of transparency with PBMs. 
You know, the old saying--I cannot remember what the movie was, 
and Senator Cruz will know, because I think he is a movie 
afficionado: ``follow the money.'' This is what the flowchart 
would also show us. Follow the money. What movie is that?
    Senator Cruz. That would be ``All the President's Men.''
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Capito. I thought it was the one with Tom Cruise. 
Anyway, so much for that. So my question is to Dr. Oftebro, and 
you have answered several of the questions that I already have. 
I know that--have you ever had success in amending or 
negotiating a contract to alleviate some of these issues? I 
think you answered that, but if you could repeat your answer 
there, please.
    Dr. Oftebro. We have made multiple attempts to try and 
negotiate better terms on contracts, and we have yet to be 
successful.
    Senator Capito. Did I accurately portray, in your mind, 
what a flowchart might look like? How would you respond to that 
if you had to bring a flowchart here?
    Dr. Oftebro. No, I think what you described was not 
complicated enough.
    Senator Capito. OK. OK. I know a few states, my state of 
West Virginia being one, you mentioned in your--in your 
hearing, the--I hope I say this right--rosuvastatin.
    Dr. Oftebro. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Capito.[--and that you had talked about the impacts 
of that and PBMs on that. Is this something that is unique to 
you, or is this occurring all across the country?
    Dr. Oftebro. Well, this was a large national Medicare Part 
D plan.
    Senator Capito. Mm-hmm.
    Dr. Oftebro. It is happening in every pharmacy in the 
country.
    Senator Capito. Mm-hmm.
    Dr. Oftebro. And it was not just this one drug. It happens 
with many, many drugs----
    Senator Capito. Mm-hmm.
    Dr. Oftebro.--every day for all kinds of plans.
    Senator Capito. OK. Also, I note that Washington's--West 
Virginia has passed a number of bills trying to get at some of 
these issues. I mean, the last thing is probably a patchwork 
issue that we need because of a lot of complications with mail 
ordering other things. Has Washington State attempted to pass 
similar laws to help you out here?
    Dr. Oftebro. We have passed some legislation, and we are 
working on additional legislation right now.
    Senator Capito. Has it been helpful?
    Dr. Oftebro. The biggest challenge that we have had in 
Washington State is that our existing legislation has exempted 
ERISA plans, so self-insured plans. And so our existing rule--
our existing laws only cover about 10 to 20 percent of the 
prescriptions that we dispense, so.
    Senator Capito. Yes. On my flowchart on insurance--
insurers, I would have to have a couple of little buckets over 
there because of all the different things. Dr. Trish, last 
question. You talk about the historic role that PBMs have 
played in lowering costs. Obviously, Senator Tester said that 
was the immediate, the first goal. But you say over the last 
decade that this situation has deteriorated. What do you 
believe has caused this shift? Is it the consolidations?
    Dr. Trish. I do think, you know, part of it has been the 
consolidation and integration. I think what we see now is that 
CVS Health and United Health Group are actually the 4th and 5th 
biggest companies by revenue on top of the Fortune 100 in the 
U.S., and Cigna, or Express Scripts, or Evernorth I think is 
number 12 now. I mean, these are--these are pretty significant 
companies here in the U.S. I think we have also continued to 
see that the market has gotten increasingly complex, and that 
makes it harder and harder to understand, and enables more 
opportunities for this type of arbitrage and kind of deceptive 
practices.
    Senator Capito. OK. So then, you know, last thought. Put 
yourself in the shoes of the person going to the counter to try 
to purchase a much-needed drug. And I think we should not lose 
sight in any hearing such as this as to the magnificent of our 
pharmaceutical industry in terms of curing and also managing 
diseases. That it something that is--that is phenomenal for all 
of us. And how is anybody supposed to know? I mean, if they 
went from Dr.--I want to not pronounce it--Oftebro's pharmacy, 
and then went to another pharmacy in West Virginia, they could 
pay totally--they could pay different prices. You know, it is 
just confuse--I think it is--the confusion masks where the 
money is going, and I think in the end, the intent is to get it 
to that person at the counter. Thank you all very much.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Sullivan.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DAN SULLIVAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Sullivan. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I want to 
thank the witnesses here. I think the themes are starting to 
emerge from this hearing, which are not terribly surprising. 
From Alaska's perspective, we have had several Alaskan-owned 
independent pharmacies that have gone out of business over the 
last several years. Obviously, it is happening all over the 
country, and the issue of the lack of transparency seems to be 
front and center. Anchorage right now, our largest city, my 
hometown, only has one independent pharmacy left. That is 
Bernie's Pharmacy run by a great Alaskan named Teresa Hall, who 
is doing a great job trying to serve local Alaskans in Sitka. 
We do not have a Walgreens or a CVS. We do have an Alaska 
family owned independent pharmacy. The White family runs that. 
They do a great job, but I hear about their struggles.
    The numbers are pretty dramatic here. According to a 2022 
report from the National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners, there are 66 PBM companies, with the three 
largest--Express Scripts, CVS Care, and Optum Rx--controlling 
more than 80 percent of the market and serving 270 million 
Americans. That is some serious market power. This is the 
opposite of small business.
    So what I wanted to ask each of the panelists, two 
questions, and you can take them in order. I will just let all 
of you respond. One is transparency. The bill that we are 
talking about today, is it the right amount of transparency? 
Are there other things we can do with regard to transparency 
for PBMs? I think that is a really obvious starting point, but 
how deep do we need to go on that, and what are we missing on 
that idea of transparency that may or may not be in this bill? 
And then second, this is a little bit more current but it is--I 
want you to kind of look at the current situation. I have 
concerns about the current situation. But structurally, is the 
FTC the correct avenue to address this transparency issue? Are 
there other agencies we should be looking at?
    I am starting to have increasing concerns about the 
leadership at the FTC. I did not vote for the Chair, Lina Khan. 
There was a Wall Street Journal article just recently, the last 
Republican Commissioner on the FTC is resigning, and she is 
doing so in part because she said, ``Khan's willful disregard 
of congressionally imposed limits on agency jurisdiction, 
defiance of legal precedent, abuse of power.'' So I am getting 
a little nervous about the FTC, both currently with the 
leadership, but also, is it structurally the right Federal 
agency to be taking a look at the transparency issues? And I 
think that is what the current--what the law that we are 
looking at proposes. So both those questions, I would open up 
to all the witnesses.
    Dr. Oftebro. Thank you, Senator, and I would like to say 
that Bernie Klouda was a dear friend and mentor of mine.
    Senator Sullivan. Oh good. Well, he did great work, but 
there, you know, it is tough. And that is----
    Dr. Oftebro. Yes.
    Senator Sullivan. You know, that is our big city, 
Anchorage, right?
    Dr. Oftebro. Yes.
    Senator Sullivan. And they are it in Anchorage.
    Dr. Oftebro. They are it. To answer your first question 
about is this the right amount of transparency, I do not know 
yet the answer to that question, but what I do know is that 
what we have now is not working.
    Senator Sullivan. Yes.
    Dr. Oftebro. And we just--we want to see PBMs regulated the 
same way that everybody else in healthcare is regulated.
    Senator Sullivan. Do you have a view on the FTC?
    Dr. Oftebro. I think my answer is the same, but what I--
what I can tell you is that, you know, from our perspective, we 
are seeing unfair and anticompetitive business practices in 
terms of our interactions with PBMs.
    Senator Sullivan. OK.
    Dr. Oftebro. And I think that is how I--you know, I do not 
know who else would----
    Senator Sullivan. Yes.
    Dr. Oftebro.--help us deal with that.
    Senator Sullivan. Any other witnesses on both the 
transparency question or the FTC question?
    Dr. Patt. So to the first question about transparency, I do 
think that this is really important, probably the most 
important piece of legislation to deal with the issue, to bring 
light to many of the other problems. There are other issues: 
co-pay accumulators----
    Senator Sullivan. Yes.
    Dr. Patt.--H.R. 830, gag clauses, fail first-step therapy, 
and other things. So there are other problems, but as you deal 
with PBMs, I frequently feel like it is a game of whack-a-mole. 
And transparency, I think, sheds light on many of the other 
challenges that is the best way and most comprehensive way to 
move forward to make meaningful change. The second issue of 
jurisdiction I do not know.
    Dr. Trish. I think also on the transparency and the scope, 
I think another sort of perhaps less appreciated actor in this 
market has been the role of the benefits consultants or the 
people who are trying to help employers navigate this and pick 
what PBM contract they should be signing. In many cases, those 
benefit consultants are not fiduciary--are not playing a 
fiduciary role for the employer but are actually being 
compensated by the PBMs as well. And so to look at even if the, 
you know, supposed brokers of information here are being 
incentivized in ways that are detrimental to the system as 
well.
    I'll just say on the second, you know, there is also the 
GAO. There are also other agencies that can be involved in 
this, too. I think, you know, to the extent that there are 
issues at the FTC, that needs to be addressed more broadly, 
right, obviously, for many reasons.
    Senator Sullivan. Any views on that?
    Dr. Mulligan. I would point you to the references in my 
testimony of FTC, DOJ, and others are very concerned about the 
effects of the transparency, particularly the way it is laid on 
in Section 2. Way too granular. With any regulation, as an 
economist, I like to be able to see the law have clearly 
defined terms, and there are a lot of terms that the 
administrative state is going to be able to interpret. And I 
share the concerns that the FTC we have now would reinvent the 
lexicon, to be frank.
    Senator Sullivan. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Blackburn.

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE

    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and thank 
you, each of you, for being here today. It is wonderful to hear 
from you on your perspective about what is going on, the FTC, 
with the work that they are doing, also looking at the vertical 
integration, and the access to different patient 
pharmaceuticals.
    And, let us see, Dr. Patt and Dr. Oftebro, I wanted to ask 
you about access to specific pharmaceuticals for patients, and 
how the PBMs affect that, and the choices that they are making. 
And how often are you--how often do you see this as a problem 
for patients getting precisely what they need for the period of 
time that they need it?
    Dr. Patt. Thank you, Senator, and I'll say I work closely 
with Dr. Patton and Dr. Schleicher in--from Tennessee Oncology 
and the Community Oncology Alliance.
    Senator Blackburn. Right.
    Dr. Patt. So they are well familiar with these issues.
    Senator Blackburn. Yes.
    Dr. Patt. We frequently see that PBMs in their insurance, 
vertically integrated partnerships, determine which therapies 
can be given first. I think a great example of that is in 
breast cancer. When I want to treat a patient with a class of 
drugs called a CDK46 inhibitor, there are three drugs that are 
approved on the market, and I might choose one because of very 
specific patient issues. One has better evidence for brain 
metastases. One is not as good if the patient has diarrhea. And 
I am frequently not able to make those choices based on what is 
best for the patient because of direction and formulary 
restriction on the part of the PBM.
    In addition to that, frequently, the PBM makes preferential 
choices that might be more expensive for the patient. So my 
colleague, Miriam Atkins, who practices out of Augusta, 
Georgia, prescribed imatinib for her patient with GI stromal 
tumor, the patient out-of-pocket cost was going to be $1,500 if 
run through insurance because of the way that they contracted 
with the--with the brand name drug. But whenever they did not 
apply it to--and the patient was not going to take their 
medication. They were just not going to treat their metastatic 
cancer. Instead, they just sold it and ran it out of their 
office, and they were able to get it for about $150, and they 
were able to take the medication. So it should not be the case 
that patients have more options by not using the insurance that 
they pay for, and these are some of the pivots that we are 
directed to because of PBM management.
    Senator Blackburn. Well, thank you for that, and thank you 
for mentioning Tennessee Oncology and the great work that they 
do there. We appreciate what they do in our community. Dr. 
Oftebro?
    Dr. Oftebro. Thank you, Senator. I would echo we see the 
exact same issues in community pharmacy when patients and 
providers are restricted in their formulary choices, and one 
medication might be more appropriate, but it is not available 
to the patient. The other thing that we see quite a bit of is 
mandatory mail order, and it may be mandatory mail order in 
general or for specific medications that pharmacy benefits 
managers have deemed as specialty, and there may not be any 
clinical rationale for a medication being designated as 
specialty. It is just in the PBM's economic benefit to 
categorize it as a specialty medication. And when those 
medications are not available to patients to access through the 
community pharmacy, that can--that can lead to gaps in therapy.
    We have had this happen with patients in--in our prep 
clinic. We run a pharmacist-run clinic for patients who are--to 
prevent HIV, and this requires labs, and then daily medication.
    Senator Blackburn. OK.
    Dr. Oftebro. And when they go without that medication 
because it does not show up on time in the mail, they have to 
restart all of that lab work.
    Senator Blackburn. Wow.
    Dr. Oftebro. It is additional costs to the Medicaid program 
and the--and the health insurers.
    Senator Blackburn. So listening to the two of you, PBMs 
actually get in the way and prohibit proper care. Let me ask 
each of you, if given the choice, would you completely 
eliminate PBMs?
    Dr. Oftebro. I think all that we are looking for is to see 
that PBMs are regulated in the same way that the rest of us are 
as healthcare providers.
    Senator Blackburn. OK.
    Dr. Oftebro. They are--they are a part of the healthcare 
system. They need to be regulated, and we need a fair 
landscape.
    Senator Blackburn. OK. Dr. Patt?
    Dr. Patt. It is so tempting to say that I would completely 
eliminate PBMs, but the truth is, I do not know that that is 
the right answer. I think it would improve upon things 
currently. I will say that I take issue with the analogy of 
PBMs being like group purchasing like you would see with a 
Costco because I think that analogy only holds if Costco is the 
only place that you can shop, because the challenge is that 
discounts that PBMs negotiate may not be translated to 
employers and patients. In fact, we do not see evidence that it 
is.
    Senator Blackburn. Right.
    Dr. Patt. In contrast to the Costco analogy where shoppers 
have the ability of choice, we do not act like that in 
healthcare, and so it is a limited analogy. And while PBMs 
might purchase at discounts, we need to see evidence of where 
those discounts are going, and I suspect that they are not 
going to patients and employers. At least when I talk to 
patients and employers, we do not see any evidence of that.
    Senator Blackburn. I am yet to find a patient who says a 
PBM has saved them money. I have found many patients who tell 
me the PBM would not allow them to have what the doctor 
prescribed. Thank you so much for being here for our hearing 
today. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
    Senator Welch [presiding]. Senator from Colorado.

             STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN HICKENLOOPER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to 
start--well, first, I want to thank you all for being here, and 
appreciate how busy you are and taking the time out to come and 
answer our questions. You add real value and perspective.
    Dr. Trish, the Schaeffer Center found that for every dollar 
Americans spend on insulin, less than half ultimately goes to 
the manufacturer. Instead, that money gets rerouted and taken 
by middlemen along the way, like PBMs. All the while, the list 
continues to grow. The list continues to go up, even on drugs 
like insulin that have been around for more than 100 years. I 
think that is really at the heart of why we need transparency. 
Where is the money going? Why are we paying so much? So Dr. 
Trish, you mentioned that transparency is a key, but further 
investigation is needed to truly understand how to reform the 
system and protect patients. What areas--what other areas do 
you believe need to be investigated?
    Dr. Trish. So thank you for the question. I think, you 
know, one of the key other issues here is the extent to which 
this is integrated has changed the incentives. And I was--I had 
the good fortune the other day of giving a talk at a health 
system where I had both the chief pharmacy offer--chief 
pharmacy officer and the H.R. person for the health system in 
the room. They were talking about this issue that we heard 
about, this report in Florida, but essentially, they--because 
they are a health system, they own a specialty pharmacy, right? 
They dispense drugs to their patients. They were saying that 
their PBM for their beneficiaries is in--is basically requiring 
them to use the in-house specialty pharmacy that is owned by 
the PBM, even though they can see that that specialty pharmacy 
that is owned by the PBM is charging them more than 3 times 
more for the drugs than what they dispense in their specialty 
pharmacy themselves.
    And those are the types of things where, you know, that 
is--that is harmful. That is not generating value. The extent 
to which that is also further affecting the types of rebate 
negotiations across drugs more broadly, that is what we need 
better insight into as well.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right. Well, certainly, a lot of what 
you are describing we see throughout healthcare, which is the 
lack of mission, that it--when I was a kid, and that is pretty 
long ago, doctors, nurses, pretty much everyone you met in a 
hospital or a medical center was there because they wanted to 
help bring reliable healthcare at the lowest possible cost to 
the--to the people of their community, and somehow we have lost 
that.
    Dr. Patt, more often than not, consumers do not have the 
necessary information available to them about how much their 
drugs cost, much less information about the role of PBMs, drug 
manufacturers, insurance companies, you know, ad infinitum, 
that help each other raise prices. I think additional 
transparency clearly is important, but we must make sure that 
the information actually reaches the patients. So, Dr. Patt, do 
you often find that your patients struggle to navigate the 
system? Does that come back to you? How can we make sure that 
PBMs provide the information in an accessible and easy-to-
understand format without layering it under, you know, portals, 
and portals, and portals?
    Dr. Patt. It is a great question, and I'll say I work 
closely with the Rocky Mountain Cancer Center doctors, so I am 
grateful for your question. I think that we need to give more 
information to patients because frequently the cost of drugs 
prohibits patients from being compliant with care. I gave the 
example of the patient with imatinib, that if they had run it 
through their insurance, their co-pay would have been $1,500 
per month. And whenever they did not go through insurance, it 
was going to be just $150 a month at the practice. Well, if the 
doctor and the pharmacist did not have an ability to have that 
discourse with the patient, the patient would have just not 
taken the medication and not benefited from the medication.
    We know from a study published in the Journal of Clinical 
Oncology in 2017 that patient adherence to their medication is 
directly related to their co-pay that they--that they have to--
that they have to pay every month. And if it is cost 
prohibitive for patients, they are not going to be compliant. 
They ration their medications. I have seen that time and time 
again, so that leads to ineffective care.
    So when you have pharmacists and medically integrated 
pharmacies where doctors talk to their patients, they are able 
to help navigate these complex systems, especially with 
expensive medications. So I think that interaction is really 
invaluable. And had that patient just simply been referred to a 
mail order pharmacy where they did not get their--where they 
would have to pay to get their drug, they just would have not 
gotten their drug. So this interaction with the healthcare team 
becomes really critical so we can help patients navigate this 
complex environment.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Exactly, and I could not agree more. 
I mean, that is--the additional hidden cost is all those 
patients that end up not taking a prescription that would, you 
know, alleviate their suffering or their discomfort, and, in 
many cases, prevent them from getting well. So anyway, 
transparency has got to be at the root of all this stuff. Thank 
you. I yield back.
    Senator Welch. Thank you. Senator Warnock.

              STATEMENT OF HON. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA

    Senator Warnock. Thank you so very much, Senator Welch. 
Last week, I invited Lacy Mason from the state of Georgia as my 
special guest at the State of the Union speech. She is a type 1 
diabetic. She needs insulin to survive. Even with insurance, 
insulin was too expensive for her to afford, and she had to 
resort to black market insulin in the United States and 
borrowing expired insulin from friends. She told the story 
about meeting people she did not know she met on Facebook in 
parking lots to get insulin. And while I am glad that my 
proposal to cap insulin at $35 per month for Medicare 
beneficiaries is now law, the fight is not over. There are 
still too many Georgians who are not able to afford the insulin 
they need to live. Dr. Trish, do you agree that prescription 
drug prices like insulin are too high?
    Dr. Trish. So that is a--there is a lot to unpack in that 
question. I think that insulin is an example where--it is a 
prime example really where the list prices are particularly 
high, and they have really increased over time in ways that 
harm patients at the pharmacy counter. The research we have 
done at the Schaeffer Center shows that the net prices that 
manufacturers receive has actually declined, although the total 
amount that we are spending when you take in--when you account 
for what the PBMs and other intermediaries are taking home has 
not declined, right? So this is an example where it depends 
what price you are asking about, but it is absolutely 
problematic for patients, yes.
    Senator Warnock. So in a sense, while it was important for 
us to have this cap, you are pointing to the larger root cause 
and the issues around PBMs. So related to that--and you point 
out the drug pricing is complex. That said, it is no secret 
that pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, have played a role in 
high drug prices, and that is what we are examining in this 
hearing today. How are PBMs contributing to high list prices 
for drugs, especially for insulin?
    Dr. Trish. Absolutely. So they are--essentially, PBMs are 
in a position where they make more money as the list price goes 
up, as they get a percentage of the rebate or some other type 
of fee that is based on that increasing list price. And so you 
have seen, even though this is--insulin is a very highly 
competitive drug class, there is multiple products that exist 
there, and the rebates are enormous, typically more than half 
of the list price. But nonetheless, the pressures and the 
incentives have made it so that if--when manufacturers have 
opted to offer lower price drugs, PBMs will not put them on 
their formularies.
    Senator Warnock. So they are incentivized to be bad actors 
in this space, costing people like Lacy, literally.
    Dr. Trish. Particularly when those patients face cost 
sharing that is based on the list price of the drug, then that 
is absolutely problematic for them, yes.
    Senator Warnock. I agree. I think Congress needs to address 
the role that PBM rebates play in high drug prices, and that is 
why I was proud to vote the Pharmacy Benefits Manager 
Transparency Act out of committee last year and look forward to 
supporting it again this year. Dr. Oftebro, I do not want to 
butcher your name. My last name is Warnock. I get called 
``Warlock'' and all kinds of things.
    [Laughter.]
    Dr. Oftebro. That was perfect.
    Senator Warnock. Is it uncommon for pharmacists to see 
folks come in unable to afford their medicine?
    Dr. Oftebro. Senator Warnock----
    Senator Warnock. Speaking of insulin.
    Dr. Oftebro. Senator Warnock, we see that every day. The 
out-of-pocket costs for patients, there is no way that it is 
not a barrier, and it is forcing--it is forcing patients to 
make very difficult decisions whether they take their medicine, 
whether they ration their medicine, whether they do not take it 
at all. But it is clearly an unbearable outcome.
    Senator Warnock. Yes. In fact, a recent article on NPR says 
that manufacturers have increased the price of insulin by more 
than 600 percent over the last 2 decades. Six hundred percent, 
a drug that was created 100 years ago, patent was sold for $1. 
Do you believe this leads to rationing--you pointed that out--
or finding other ways for patients to drag out how long the 
medicine will last or refill? What kinds of effects does this 
have on patients' health because I think as we work on the 
policy, we have to center real people. What is the impact on 
the patient?
    Dr. Oftebro. Well, when a patient is not taking their 
medication as prescribed, there are all kinds of negative 
impacts, but they are ultimately deteriorating health. They are 
using the healthcare system inappropriately, more ER visits, 
and, you know, these have cost all of us at that point.
    Senator Warnock. So it costs them more, and it costs us 
more.
    Dr. Oftebro. Correct.
    Senator Warnock. So thank you so much. Look, hearings like 
this are incredibly important so we can come together and work 
to get something done for our constituents. And everything we 
do on drug pricing, it seems to me we have to center the 
patients because they are the ones who are really caught in the 
middle, and I hope we can get some progress. Thank you for 
everything you do on this front.
    Senator Welch. Thank you. Senator Klobuchar.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you. Dr. Trish, my bill with 
Senator Grassley, the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics 
and Biosimilars Act, passed out of the Judiciary Committee for 
a second time last week, and it would limit anticompetitive 
deals where brand name drug companies pay generic competitors 
to stay off the market. It is known as ``pay for delay,'' 
costing consumers millions of dollars, stifling competition. Do 
you think measures like this would help lower drug prices, and 
why is it important that we include biosimilars?
    Dr. Trish. Absolutely. So I think it is--it is very 
important to recognize, right, if you go back to the Hatch-
Waxman Act, right, the idea here was to kind of preserve the 
incentives to produce innovative products, but with the 
expectation or return being that once those products went 
generic, they would be widely available at low cost and 
providing value to many Americans. And I think it is important 
that we ensure that we are delivering on the promise of that 
bipartisan legislation that, you know, worked so well for so 
long.
    I think some of the things that we have concerns about are 
whether PBMs are actually getting in the way of that kind of 
grand bargain working out for society by inflating the cost of 
generic drugs and other things like that when they do get to 
market, and, ultimately, not delivering on the value when they 
become generic that we expect.
    Senator Klobuchar. Another question. The House Oversight 
Committee recently found--as you know, I chair the Competition 
Policy, Antitrust, Consumer Rights Subcommittee over in 
Judiciary. And House Oversight found in an investigation of 
high drug prices that drug companies use strategies to suppress 
competition and maintain monopoly pricing by pursuing contracts 
with PBMs and insurers that condition drug manufacturer rebates 
and price discounts on excluding competitor products from PBM 
and health plan formularies. Do branded drug manufacturers 
offer larger rebates to or force bundled contracts on PBMs in 
order to keep potential competitors off the market, and what 
effects do those contract terms have?
    Dr. Trish. So it is certainly the case that as part of the 
negotiation between PBMs and manufacturers, you know, the kind 
of goal of what PBMs are trying to pursue or extract value is 
to basically say, offer us a bigger discount or a lower price 
in exchange for us driving more volume toward your product 
rather than a competitor's product. I think the--when that 
works and when those savings are passed to consumers, that can 
be beneficial in driving value. But the issue is that when 
those savings or the benefits of that transaction or 
negotiation do not reach consumers, then we are not really 
getting the value that we are supposed to be out of these types 
of negotiations.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Very good. Thank you, and next up, 
price transparency. Do you think we need more price 
transparency in the medication supply chain? I guess I'll ask 
you, Mr. Oftebro, and thank you so much for your work. Could 
you answer that?
    Dr. Oftebro. We absolutely need more transparency in the 
prescription drug price chain. We have--we have no idea. I am 
not only a pharmacist, I am an employer----
    Senator Klobuchar. Mm-hmm.
    Dr. Oftebro.--so I deal with these issues as an employer as 
well. And even as a pharmacist and understanding how the drug 
chain--supply chain is supposed to work, it is so difficult for 
me as an employer to get the visibility into our own drug spend 
that we clearly have a problem.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Thank you. Back to you, Dr. Trish. 
One issue that I have been working on for years--Senator 
Collins and I passed a major bill on this--is drug shortages 
and going to drug manufacturers in other countries when we have 
a shortage. Some of these shortages, as you know, have 
returned. What are PBMs and drug manufacturings doing to better 
anticipate and forecast demand for medicines and avoid 
shortages, and what do you think we should do?
    Dr. Trish. So I think this is absolutely an important 
issue. You are starting to see, for example, new entrants into 
the market, like the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company. We have 
heard a lot about what they are doing on the PBM side, but they 
are actually also stepping in as a manufacturing plant to 
manufacture some of these drugs that are in short supply. I 
believe they are--last I heard, they were starting with sterile 
water, which is actually a very important part of the 
healthcare system that receives probably less attention than it 
should. So these are some of the ways that the market is 
stepping in to help, but I think that the issues that are 
created by the dynamics and pressures that they are having 
throughout the supply chain are exactly the type of thing into 
which we need more insight.
    Senator Klobuchar. All right. Thank you very much.
    Senator Welch. Senator Rosen.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JACKY ROSEN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Rosen. Well, thank you, Senator Welch. Appreciate 
that. We are really pleased that you are holding this important 
hearing today because bringing down the high cost of 
prescription drugs, it is one of my top priorities for Nevadans 
from Ely to Pahrump, all across our state. And as we continue 
to build on the successes of the Inflation Reduction Act--
excuse me--including allowing Medicare to negotiate for the 
lowest price of prescription drugs and capping insulin costs 
for seniors at just $35 a month, I am really glad to see that 
there is a commitment in this committee to work toward lowering 
prescription drug prices for everyone.
    And I want to continue along the lines of Senator Tester 
and Senator Sullivan on the impact of PBMs on rural and 
independent pharmacies because they are just a critical 
lifeline for our rural Nevadans. And in my state, like so many 
others, independent pharmacies, they serve not only as accent--
access points for rural Nevadans to receive their prescription 
medication, but they often provide clinical services, like 
blood pressure, glucose monitoring for those with high blood 
pressure and diabetes. Unfortunately, between 2003 and 2018, 
more than 1,200--1,200--independently owned rural pharmacies 
across this country have closed, including in Nevada. In fact, 
there are many communities in my state that have just one or no 
rural pharmacies remaining. And so one challenge is that prices 
for what should be cheap generic drugs end up being higher for 
these pharmacists--pharmacies in the larger chains.
    I have heard from independent pharmacies across my state 
and in Reno who are going to work every day to provide patients 
with lifesaving medication. But as a result of the current 
prescription drug reimbursement ecosystem, they are struggling 
just to keep the lights on and serve the people that they care 
about in their communities. And so, Dr. Oftebro, you are based 
in Seattle, but like in my state of Nevada, Washington State, 
you have numerous rural communities that have lost their 
independent pharmacies, due in part to the practices of PBMs. 
So what are you hearing from your fellow pharmacists in rural 
areas across your state about that pressure they feel from 
current dispensing reimbursement policies?
    Dr. Oftebro. Thank you, Senator, for the question. You are 
absolutely right. Our independent community pharmacies in our 
rural communities are vital lifelines, and Washington State is 
no exception. We have--we have pharmacies in rural areas. We 
have pharmacies on islands. A good colleague, Rick McCoy, is on 
Lopez Island in the San Juans, and he is the only pharmacy on 
the island, and he was able to provide thousands of COVID 
vaccines during the pandemic, and he is--he is struggling. And, 
you know, if he is not able there--to be there to provide for 
his community, people on the island are going to have to travel 
hours via ferry to get to the next closest pharmacy.
    So it is--it is an absolutely crucial issue, and we need to 
ensure that these rural pharmacies, who are the only access 
point of healthcare for many communities, remain viable.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. And I want to build on that, 
thinking about rebates because they are intended to lower costs 
for consumers, but the reality on the ground looks very 
different for far too many families, and especially Nevada 
families. And there is limited Federal transparency in the 
rebate process, so it is hard to know how we can best ensure 
savings from rebates, that they are actually passed on to the 
consumer. So, Dr. Trish, how can we ensure that rebate savings 
are actually passed on to the consumer in order to lower costs 
at the pharmacy counter? These are lifesaving drugs. People 
need them, and we want to give them the best price.
    Dr. Trish. Yes, you are absolutely right. So I think all 
too often, these rebates are not being shared at the pharmacy 
counter. We have done research showing the impact this has had, 
estimating that about half of Medicare Part D beneficiaries pay 
more out of pocket then they would have had rebates been shared 
with them at the pharmacy counter, some of them, about 20 
percent on the order of more than $100 extra per year. 
Interestingly, it also lead--or has led to accelerated Federal 
spending on the Reinsurance Program in Medicare Part D as well, 
so it has many, many different effects.
    I think, you know, there are policies that could encourage 
or promote sharing at the pharmacy counter with patients, but I 
think the other thing is, as we heard, there is a bit of a game 
of whack-a-mole here. And so, as we have shined more of a light 
on rebates, there are now contracts that at least require more 
rebate sharing with the plans themselves, but that has led to 
other types of fees, and offshore rebate aggregators, and all 
these other things where it is hard to keep up and make sure 
that once we focus on something, it is not just going somewhere 
else. And that is where we need kind of true transparency and a 
true understanding of all of the--where the dollars are flowing 
across the board.
    Senator Rosen. Well, I am glad you brought that up. I do 
not have time for any more questions, but I do want to have 
some explanations on this rebate administration fee, and so we 
will put that for the record because, again, these can be the 
way that people are shuffling these charges around, ultimately 
hurting the consumer. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back.
    Senator Welch. Thank you, Senator Rosen. The hearing record 
will remain open for 3 weeks, until March 9, 2023. Any senators 
who would like to submit questions for the record should do so 
in the next 2 weeks. That is by March 2, 2023. Witnesses, by 
the way, thank you so much for your testimony. We ask your 
responses be returned to the Committee as quickly as possible, 
but no later than March 9.
    And that concludes today's hearing. Thank you very, very 
much.
    [Whereupon, at 11:51 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

                            A P P E N D I X

        Prepared Testimony by Representative Mark Takano (CA-39)
    Thank you for allowing me to submit my testimony.
    As the panelists today have outlined, Pharmacy Benefit Managers 
hold a tremendous amount of power in determining the cost of 
prescription drugs. This impact is felt by Americans everywhere, 
including myself.
    As a Member of Congress, I have an insurance plan that I get 
through the DC Marketplace. Like most Americans, I rely on prescription 
medication, and--like many Americans--I have walked up to the pharmacy 
counter with no idea of how much my next refill was going to cost. The 
fluctuating prices are subject only to the oversight of the PBM.
    As an example, I recently went to pick up a prescription I needed 
and found that the copayment had ballooned to triple its price. If I 
paid out-of-pocket, that cost wouldn't count against my deductible. 
Ultimately, I chose to use a drug coupon to cover a portion of the cost 
of the drug, but this isn't a solution. Drug coupons are a band-aid fix 
that does not address the deeper systemic issues with the industry's 
cost-setting mechanisms.
    This is an all-too familiar experience for so many, and the bottom 
line is this: the majority of Americans rely on prescription 
medication, and the monopolistic practices of these PBMs are forcing 
them to make extreme and excruciating choices between paying their 
rent, buying their groceries, and keeping the lights on--or getting the 
medication they need to survive. I hear from constituents on a daily 
basis that have far more complex conditions that require access to 
prescription medication in order to manage them.
    There is no other option for them. Because of the vertical 
integration, the consolidation, and the self-dealing that occurs in 
PBMs, American consumers are left without other safe options. Senator 
Cantwell cited examples of patients crossing the border to seek their 
medications, rationing drugs, and foregoing necessary doses because 
they can't pay the prices set, and the sad reality is that every Member 
of this representative body has constituents that are forced to make 
those choices.
    Monopolistic business practices driven by profit are bad enough in 
any industry, but when that industry controls Americans' access to 
basic healthcare needs--that is despicable. I thank the Chairwoman and 
Ranking Member for their attention to this issue and the panelists for 
their participation.
                                 ______
                                 
        Prepared Statement of FMI--the Food Industry Association
    On behalf of the food industry, including many thousands of 
supermarket pharmacies and those of our member companies that provide 
health care coverage to their employees, we at FMI--the Food Industry 
Association thank Chairwoman Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz and the 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation for holding 
this hearing to shine a spotlight on the conflicts of interest embedded 
in the structure of the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) industry while 
considering how the Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act (S. 127) 
would bring increased transparency into PBM business practices and 
prohibit several anticompetitive PBM tactics. The legislation would 
also give the Federal Trade Commission (and state attorneys general) 
greater enforcement authorities to prevent PBM abuses, which is 
particularly important given the Commission's ongoing inquiry into the 
impact of vertically integrated PBMs on the access and affordability of 
prescription drugs and following its decision to increase enforcement 
against those PBMs participating in rebate schemes that block access to 
lower cost drugs.
    FMI strongly agrees with the Committee that the largest PBMs--both 
in terms of how they are allowed to operate and due to the lack of 
transparency surrounding their operations--contribute to significantly 
higher costs for patients, pharmacies, other health care providers, and 
employers. We are particularly concerned about the way PBMs threaten 
the country's most accessible and trusted health care professionals--
pharmacists and their pharmacies.
    Supermarket pharmacies are especially important access points for 
consumers in underserved, low-income, rural, and urban communities, but 
PBM practices and the lack of meaningful Federal oversight are 
preventing FMI member companies from opening new pharmacies and causing 
some to leave the pharmacy business altogether. FMI thanks Chairwoman 
Cantwell and Sen.
    Grassley for championing the PBM Transparency Act and the Senate 
Commerce Committee for advancing the bill previously, and we urge swift 
passage of this bipartisan legislation in the 118th Congress.
    As the food industry association, FMI works with and on behalf of 
the entire industry--from retailers who sell to consumers, including 
supermarket pharmacies, to producers who supply the food and other 
products sold in grocery venues--to advance safer and more efficient 
consumer supply chains for both food and pharmaceuticals. In total, FMI 
member companies, which range from independent operators to the largest 
national and international players, operate roughly 33,000 grocery 
stores and 12,000 pharmacies, ultimately touching the lives of more 
than 100 million U.S. households on a weekly basis and representing an 
$800 billion industry with nearly 6 million employees. Throughout the 
ongoing COVID-19 health emergency, our members have been and continue 
to be a critical component of ensuring the availability of food, 
pharmacy and health care services in communities across this Nation. 
Moreover, supermarket pharmacies have played an outsized role in the 
COVID-19 vaccination effort while also serving as a bridge between our 
communities and other providers, offering patients immediate care that 
is close and convenient to home. www.fmi.org
Background
    Although unknown to much of the American public, PBMs are powerful 
middlemen at the center of the U.S. prescription drug system. 
Historically, PBMs played an important role in the administration of 
prescription drug programs--designed to take the paperwork burden away 
from pharmacists. However, in recent years, the PBM marketplace has 
transformed considerably, and they are doing just the opposite. As a 
result of consolidation among PBMs, health insurance companies and 
acquired pharmacies, a small number of large corporations now wield 
nearly limitless power and influence over the prescription drug market 
for 260+ million Americans. Among other things, PBMs negotiate drug 
costs, dictate which drugs will be included on plan formularies, and 
control how those drugs are dispensed. In other words, they control 
which medicines are prescribed to patients, which pharmacies patients 
can access, how much patients will pay at the pharmacy counter, and the 
amount pharmacies are ultimately reimbursed. Yet, PBMs are one of the 
least regulated sectors of the healthcare system and drug supply chain; 
there has been almost no Federal antitrust enforcement, oversight, or 
regulation.
Supermarket Pharmacy
    PBMs' market concentration empowers them to offer supermarket 
pharmacies of all sizes take-it-or-leave-it contracts: The pharmacy 
must either accept a PBM's mandated contract terms (including, among 
other things, allowing the PBM to unilaterally set prices for certain 
drugs and then later impose retroactive fees based on an opaque 
methodology), or give up the ability to serve the many customers whose 
health plans contract with the PBM, which would include existing 
customers who have longstanding relationships with their pharmacists. 
Therefore, these nonnegotiable, take-it-or-leave-it contracts allow 
PBMs to create endless schemes to reduce reimbursement, claw back 
funds, restrict networks, require extensive audits and effectively 
force pharmacies to provide drugs below cost.
    PBMs frequently assert that below-cost reimbursement is a problem 
only for poorly run pharmacies and that low PBM reimbursement rates 
create an incentive for such poorly run pharmacies to improve their 
purchasing practices. However, the PBM industry has resisted attempts 
to force price transparency that would reveal the basis for these 
claims. Furthermore, pharmacies of all sizes--not just ``poorly run'' 
ones--are suffering as a result of PBMs' below-cost pricing. Even FMI's 
largest members--Fortune 500 companies with efficiencies, expertise in 
supply chain logistics, and economies of scale--struggle to operate 
financially viable pharmacies.
    Unlike independent pharmacies, FMI supermarket pharmacy members are 
not dependent solely on their pharmacy operations for survival, and 
therefore, PBM abuses may not threaten to force them to close their 
doors to grocery operations. However, PBM practices make it likely that 
grocers will be forced to continue leaving the pharmacy business--
either by outsourcing their pharmacy operations to the biggest, PBM-
affiliated players in the market, or worse, by abandoning pharmacy 
operations altogether. Supermarket pharmacy closures, and abandoned 
expansions, thus contribute to the overall trend of decreased access to 
pharmacies and ``pharmacy deserts.'' The effect of such closures is 
particularly acute in certain rural and urban communities, where 
closures are more prevalent and detrimental to a community's access to 
health care. The closure of pharmacies in recent years has created 
``pharmacy deserts'' in some underserved communities.
Employer Health Care
    As employers that sponsor plans to provide health care coverage to 
their employees, FMI member companies see how PBM practices exploit 
inherent conflicts of interest to the detriment of health care plans 
and beneficiaries. Case in point, PBMs are responsible for developing 
health care plan formularies, or lists of drugs that a plan will cover, 
and drug companies compete to have their drugs listed on those 
formularies by offering compensation to PBMs in the form of rebates. 
PBMs base formulary access decisions on the amount of the rebates, 
which incentivizes drug manufacturers to offer higher rebates to secure 
preferred status and the PBMs, in turn, to put higher-cost drugs on 
their formularies, because the rebates are based on a percentage of a 
drug's list price. Put simply, PBMs may be making decisions on 
inclusion of a drug based not on clinical research or evidence-based 
efficacy and safety, but on which manufacturer offers a higher rebate 
payment.
    Therefore, in pursuit of higher rebates, PBMs routinely deny access 
to formularies, change drug formularies, or require prior authorization 
for drugs that may be best for a patient's condition, even in cases 
where a more affordable medication is available. For example, a PBM 
often excludes a lower priced generic or biosimilar because the higher 
priced branded drug offers higher rebates. Meanwhile, our members' 
health plans have little visibility into these rebates, making it 
difficult for them to monitor whether their contracted PBMs are 
choosing drugs to reduce plan costs or to increase the PBMs' own 
financial models. In short, the current system incentivizes PBMs to 
give higher-priced drugs more favorable health-plan coverage, directing 
patients toward more expensive drugs.
Conclusion
    PBMs have been allowed to operate without oversight, shrouded in 
secrecy, to the detriment of consumers, pharmacies, providers and 
employers. Now, Congress has an opportunity to advance legislation that 
would help control consumers' drug costs, stabilize the operating 
environment for pharmacies, and incentivize transparent PBM practices 
that enhance employer-sponsored health coverage for beneficiaries and 
get PBMs back to their original mission--reducing paperwork so 
pharmacists can spend more time with patients. We look forward to 
working with the Senate Commerce Committee, Senate leadership and the 
many pharmacy champions throughout Congress to get this legislation 
across the finish line.
    FMI thanks the Committee for the opportunity to provide input on 
this critically important topic. If you have questions about these

Prepared Statement of National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA)
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and Members of the Committee:

    Thank you for conducting this hearing on pharmacy benefit managers 
and the need for transparency on their anticompetitive practices that 
harm patients and small business pharmacies. In this statement, NCPA 
offers support for S.127, the Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act 
of 2023, which would provide plan sponsors/employers much needed 
transparency on how PBMs administer their pharmacy benefit and clarify 
the Federal Trade Commission's enforcement authority to prohibit unfair 
or deceptive business practices in which PBM-insurers engage in the 
commercial health insurance market.
    NCPA represents America's community pharmacists, including 19,400 
independent community pharmacies. Almost half of all community 
pharmacies provide long-term care (LTC) services and play a critical 
role in ensuring patients have immediate access to medications in both 
community and LTC settings. Together, our members represent a $78.5 
billion health care marketplace, employ 240,000 individuals, and 
provide an expanding set of health care services to millions of 
patients every day. Our members are small business owners who are among 
America's most accessible health care providers.
    Our pharmacies and the patients they serve have long had concerns 
about PBM-insurers, their anticompetitive practices, and the role they 
play in ever-increasing drug costs. PBM-insurer practices continue to 
cause these small businesses to struggle to remain viable and open to 
provide continued access and care. We appreciate the longstanding 
efforts of Chair Cantwell and Senator Grassley to address these 
practices and the negative impact they have on patients and small 
business independent pharmacies with the introduction of this 
legislation last Congress and its advancement through the Commerce 
Committee on a bipartisan basis.
    NCPA has been proud to work with the sponsors of this legislation 
since its introduction last Congress as it would bring much needed 
transparency to and ultimately stop PBM-insurers' unjust and deceptive 
practices. For years, NCPA has highlighted the problems posed by 
increasing consolidation in the health care industry, specifically that 
three PBM-insurers now control approximately 80 percent of the market. 
Advancing this legislation will clarify the FTC's enforcement authority 
when addressing the deceptive and anti-competitive business practices 
perpetrated by the consolidated PBM-insurer industry, including spread 
pricing and clawbacks.
    NCPA applauds the committee for holding this important legislative 
hearing, and we support passage of S.127, the Pharmacy Benefit Manager 
Transparency Act of 2023. As the bill advances through the Senate 
Commerce Committee, NCPA hopes that the bill language will be tightened 
to ensure provisions align with many state laws. NCPA thanks Chair 
Cantwell and Senator Grassley for your leadership in addressing this 
issue, and we look forward to working with you to get this bipartisan 
legislation across the finish line this Congress.
                                 ______
                                 
    Prepared Statement of Pharmaceutical Care Management Association
Introduction
    The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA) appreciates 
the opportunity to provide this statement sharing the PBM industry's 
concerns with how the PBM Transparency Act would impact the market for 
prescription drugs. PCMA is the national association representing 
America's pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which administer 
prescription drug plans and operate home delivery and specialty 
pharmacies for more than 275 million Americans with health coverage 
through public and private employers, labor unions, Medicare, Medicaid, 
the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, and the exchanges 
established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Our members work closely 
with health plans and health insurance issuers to secure lower costs 
for prescription drugs and achieve better health outcomes.
    As pharmacy benefit experts, PBMs generate tremendous value, 
estimated at $145 billion annually for society,<SUP>i</SUP> and save 
payers and patients an average of $1,040 per person per 
year.<SUP>ii</SUP> For many years, evidence has also shown a return of 
10:1 on investments in PBM services for clients.<SUP>iii</SUP> Even 
with the substantial savings generated by pharmacy benefit companies, 
over a quarter of adults say it is difficult to afford their 
prescription drugs<SUP>iv</SUP>--demonstrating the need for policymaker 
action focused on areas of dysfunction in the private market.

Competition is the Best Way to Lower Prescription Drug Costs
    PBMs work to improve prescription drug affordability by providing 
prescribers with information about less expensive generic alternatives, 
setting performance standards for pharmacies to encourage generic 
fills, and ensuring patients are aware of lower cost alternatives. Due 
in large part to these efforts by PBMs, 90 percent of prescription drug 
fills are generics.<SUP>v</SUP> Pharmacy benefit companies also support 
increased uptake of biosimilars through business decisions, such as 
preferring both the brand and a biosimilar to ensure patients and 
providers have the proper incentives to choose lower cost options and 
the choice to continue with a drug they may be reluctant to move away 
from, and policy proposals, including eliminating the 
interchangeability designation to reduce costs and confusion, stopping 
patent abuses, and making it easier for Medicare Part D plans to update 
formularies as new biosimilars come to market.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Toward that end, PCMA recently proposed the following three keys in 
a policy platform supportive of a more sustainable health care future:

        Key #1: Ensure System Sustainability by Promoting Competition. 
        Enabling a robust private prescription drug marketplace that 
        promotes competition is the best way to drive down prescription 
        drug costs and make more affordable alternatives available for 
        patients.

        Key #2: Support and Equip Clinicians with Tools and Data to 
        Serve Patients Optimally. Pharmacy benefit experts support 
        efforts to help clinicians, including pharmacists and other 
        health care practitioners, ``practice at the top of their 
        license'' to optimize use of their clinical expertise and 
        counseling abilities. Pharmacy benefit companies also work to 
        increase clinicians' administrative efficiency by offering 
        information and tools to help serve patients.

        Key #3: Enhance Patient Outcomes and Improve the Patient 
        Experience. Pharmacy benefit companies use their prescription 
        drug expertise to support better health outcomes and provide 
        recommendations to meet each patient's needs.

    Our Affordable Future policy platform proposes numerous solutions 
to build on the private market system and facilitate collaboration 
among patients, regulators, PBMs, clinicians, health plans, and 
pharmacies to work toward a more functional, equitable, and affordable 
market for prescription drugs.
    PCMA supports numerous pieces of legislation introduced by Members 
of the Senate Commerce Committee and others, including the package of 
bills approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee just last week and in 
the previous Congress. These measures align with the solutions proposed 
by our organization, and we continue to support the Interagency Patent 
Coordination and Improvement Act of 2023, the Prescription Pricing for 
the People Act of 2023, the Stop STALLING Act, the Preserve Access to 
Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act, and the Affordable 
Prescriptions for Patients Act. PCMA also supported Senator Rosen's 
Expanding Access to Affordable Prescription Drugs and Medical Devices 
Act to improve the competitive landscape for prescription drugs.
The PBM Transparency Act of 2023 Includes an Unprecedented Expansion of 
        FTC Powers
    This bill would egregiously expand the power, authority, and 
jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), placing the agency 
in the middle of private business dealings normally handled by 
contracts, and allowing the agency to pick industry winners and losers. 
Further, the bill would do nothing to lower drug costs and would 
instead have the opposite effect by reducing competition among 
prescription drug manufacturers and pharmacies and increasing costs 
throughout the system.
    The FTC is currently conducting a 6(b) study on PBMs, which 
significantly overlaps the data requested in the FTC reports proposed 
in this bill. Our industry is confident the ongoing study will find, as 
other FTC reports have, that the PBM market is competitive and diverse, 
with more than 70 individual companies of varying size operating across 
the Nation in a variety of markets. Before taking any legislative 
action, Congress should wait and see what the FTC finds and recommends.
    Regardless of the outcome of the study, it is important to note 
that the Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act of 2023 is not 
aligned with the historical focus of the FTC, which has in the past 
focused its transparency efforts primarily on consumer protection and 
education. This expansion of the FTC's authority would set a precedent 
for allowing the FTC to micromanage business practices and regulate 
prices, which could be applied to any industry.
    Beyond the dramatic expansion of the FTC's authority, providing 
state attorneys general with enforcement discretion over private 
contracts would create an opportunity for them to wield that power to 
insert themselves into the private dealings of PBMs and mail-order 
pharmacies. If a state attorney general had an interest in a particular 
drug or class of drugs and wanted information about who is buying, 
selling, shipping, or otherwise distributing that drug, they could use 
the authority granted to them under this Act as a pretext for accessing 
personal health information that would otherwise be private. Further, 
this expansion would create the need for coordination between the FTC 
and 50 or more state, district, or territory attorneys 
general<SUP>vi</SUP> and would require significant additional taxpayer-
funded resources for the Commission to manage this complicated 
patchwork of enforcement and standards.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \vi\ The legislative text does not clearly state whether it is only 
states or also the Federal District of Columbia and territorites' 
attorneys that would gain these powers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It is difficult to estimate the total requirement for resources, as 
the language under section two prohibiting arbitrary, unfair, or 
deceptive business practices is unclear. Two of the three prohibited 
practices terms are clearly defined in established law, but one is 
not--``deceptive'' and ``unfair'' are clearly defined, ``arbitrary'' is 
not. The lack of clarity around this term could cause attorneys general 
to make inconsistent attempts at enforcement, creating costs for the 
Commission as it tries to reconcile these disparate approaches, and 
businesses as they attempt to defend themselves. The FTC has a long 
history of enforcing Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits ``unfair 
or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.'' 
<SUP>vii</SUP> Delegating this authority to states therefore seems 
unnecessary.

tion5enforcement.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There is no similar history of prohibiting practices simply because 
they are arbitrary. In fact, the FTC may not have the authority to 
prohibit acts or practices that are neither unfair nor deceptive, but 
are simply arbitrary. Congress has also never enacted a law against 
arbitrary business practices. When used in a legal context, the term 
``arbitrary'' generally protects the public from arbitrary government 
overreach (e.g., ``arbitrary and capricious'' is a judicial standard of 
review). The use of this term as it relates to private business is out 
of place, and its inclusion could lead to actual, prohibited arbitrary 
enforcement by the FTC or the states.
    At present, no other industry is regulated in the intrusive and 
anticompetitive manner proposed in the legislation, which would force 
businesses to provide potential customers, suppliers, and the public 
with proprietary information. The bill also would give the FTC review 
and enforcement authority of any private contract related to pharmacy 
benefit managers and set a precedent for allowing the FTC to manipulate 
prices, which Congress could apply to any industry.
This Bill Would Increase Consumer Costs
    This bill would do nothing to lower prescription drug costs for 
consumers, and actually threatens to increase them. Requiring the 
exposure of proprietary contracting information would allow competitors 
to learn of others' price concessions, which would facilitate tacit 
collusion and increase costs. The FTC has historically spoken out 
against over-exposing information about private business dealings 
because such an approach is deeply damaging to a competitive 
marketplace, stating, ``If pharmaceutical manufacturers learn the exact 
amount of the rebates offered by their competitors (either because the 
safeguards on subsequent disclosure by purchasers and prospective 
purchasers are insufficient or because the mandated disclosure to 
prescribers provides sufficient information for pharmaceutical 
manufacturers to calculate these amounts) then tacit collusion among 
manufacturers is more feasible. Consequently, the required disclosures 
may lead to higher prices for PBM services and Pharmaceuticals.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The FTC is not alone in this assertion. Recently, in speaking about 
concerns related to anticompetitive information exchanges, Principal 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Doha Mekki noted on behalf of the 
Department of Justice (DOJ) that, ``Courts have long recognized that 
the exchange of competitively sensitive information can subvert the 
competitive process and harm competition.'' Attorney General Mekki also 
spoke of the United States Supreme Court's concern that sharing current 
pricing information risks greater harm than sharing old, stale 
information, and specifically stated that, ``transparency in the health 
care arena may lead to tacit collusion and higher prices.'' 
<SUP>ix</SUP> She went on to say:

assistant-attorney-general-doha-mekki-antitrust-division-delivers-0.

        Courts also have looked at the degree to which the exchanged 
        data has been aggregated. These decisions considered how, in 
        light of the facts and market realities at the time, the 
        information could facilitate and result in the type of behavior 
        that the antitrust laws condemn. The Second Circuit explained 
        in Todd that ``[p]rice exchanges that identify particular 
        parties, transactions, and prices are seen as potentially 
        anticompetitive because they may be used to police a secret or 
        tacit conspiracy to stabilize prices Courts prefer that 
        information be aggregated in the form of industry averages, 
        thus avoiding transactional specificity.'' But facial 
        aggregation of data alone has been held to be insufficient to 
        save otherwise problematic information exchanges. In Todd, the 
        Second Circuit looked beyond data that appeared to be somewhat 
        aggregated to conclude that the defendants had the ability to 
        effectively disaggregate it, raising serious antitrust 
        concerns.<SUP>x</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \x\ Ibid. Includes information sourced from Todd, 275 F.3d at 212-
2013.

    The language under ``exceptions'' is not clear and can be 
interpreted as requiring full disclosure from and to every business 
entity in the prescription drug payment chain including pharmaceutical 
manufacturers, pharmacies, employers, wholesalers, physician groups, 
and hospital systems, which could lead to tacit collusion among 
pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacies. The language states that 
the PBM must provide full and complete disclosure of the cost, price, 
and reimbursement of the prescription drug as well as fees, markups, 
and discounts, to each health plan, payer, and pharmacy with which it 
does business. Since pharmaceutical manufacturers have health plans, 
the language makes it sound like manufacturers themselves would have 
full access to this data, including information about all of their 
competitors' pricing. This information sharing would likely damage the 
private market as Mekki warns, ``A softening of competition through 
tacit coordination, facilitated by information sharing, distorts free 
market competition in the process.''
This Bill Puts Patients' Privacy at Risk
    By expanding state authority to review patient- and drug-specific 
information, this bill threatens patient privacy and exposes 
individuals and employers to state enforcement, posing a significant 
risk that state agencies could use patient- or plan-specific 
information to enforce laws outside of the scope of this legislation.
PBMs Presently Comply with Numerous Disclosure Requirements
    Pharmacy benefit companies already operate under Federal 
transparency requirements and adhere to myriad contractually required 
transparency previsions imposed by their own clients.
    PBMs are subject to regulations promulgated by the Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor, the 
Department of Treasury, the Food and Drug Administration, and states. 
PBM practices are overseen by state Medicaid agencies, state-based 
consumer protection agencies, private accreditation organizations, and 
their own clients--health plan sponsors and PBMs are directly regulated 
by state departments of insurance or other state agencies.
    Several Federal departments and agencies require extensive 
reporting from various health care entities on drug pricing, which 
require input from PBMs. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
(CMS) requires reporting from multiple entities, including Exchange and 
Medicare plans which must publicly report data on numerous 
administrative processes like coverage determinations and prior 
authorization; benefits design; generic dispensing rate (by pharmacy 
type); the aggregate amount and type of rebates, discounts, or price 
concessions that are attributable to patient utilization, those that 
are passed on to the plan sponsor; the total number of prescriptions 
that were dispensed; and the difference between the amount the health 
plan pays the PBM and the amount that the PBM pays retail and mail 
order pharmacies. Medicare Part D plans must also submit Prescription 
Drug Event (PDE) records, a summary of Part D claims activities for 
each drug dispensed. When plans submit PDEs to CMS for payment, they 
include any pharmacy dispensing fee. As part of the bid and 
reconciliation processes, PBMs (via the Part D plans) must report 
estimated pharmacy and manufacturer Direct and Indirect Remuneration 
(DIR), including rebates and other price concessions.
    Part D plans and the PBMs that administer them must also implement 
real-time benefits tools to give patients and prescribers cost sharing 
and benefits information at the point of prescribing.
    Beginning December 27, 2022, the Departments of Treasury, HHS, 
Labor, and the Office of Personnel Management required PBMs to report:

  <bullet> The 50 most frequently dispensed brand prescription drugs.

  <bullet> The 50 costliest prescription drugs by total annual 
        spending.

  <bullet> The 50 prescription drugs with the greatest increase in 
        expenditures from the previous year.

  <bullet> Prescription drug rebates, fees, and payments by drug 
        manufacturers in each therapeutic class of drugs, as well as 
        for each of the 25 drugs that yielded the highest amount of 
        rebates.

  <bullet> The premium and out-of-pocket cost impact of prescription 
        drug rebates, fees, and other payments.

    PBMs may report these data directly to the government or to their 
clients. The clients (plan sponsors, issuers, and the FEHB program 
carriers generally) are required to submit this information aggregated 
at the state/market level, rather than separately for each plan.
    Beyond government reporting requirements, much of the PBMs' 
operational specifics are available to plan enrollees through other 
provisions of the ACA and Social Security Act including the Summary of 
Benefits and Coverage, Medicare Plan Finder, and real-time benefit 
tools that provide current information on prescription drug benefits.
    The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also requires publicly 
traded health plans and PBMs to report quarterly and annual financial 
information to the SEC.
This Act Interferes with Businesses' Ability to Provide Affordable 
        Benefits
    The Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act fails to consider 
employers' need for choice and flexibility when it comes to designing 
prescription drug benefits that meet the health and affordability needs 
of unique employee populations. Employers and other health plan 
sponsors vary dramatically in size, resources, and function and serve 
diverse populations. Employer health plan sponsors know more about 
their financial resources and plan participants than any other entity 
and they use that information to make choices about how to best serve 
their unique populations.
    Health plan sponsors, including employers, are not required to use 
PBMs, and yet nearly all of them elect to contract with a pharmacy 
benefit company to administer their prescription drug benefits. Plan 
sponsors rely on PBM expertise to secure savings through price 
concessions from pharmaceutical companies (through formularies and 
other tools), administer medication adherence and health coaching 
programs, and provide overall guidance and expertise on pharmacy 
benefit design and coverage. Employers report about 80 percent 
satisfaction with the cost-saving, health-improving services provided 
by their PBM.
    Plan sponsors should have the option of determining how they would 
like to pay the pharmacy benefit company they select for their 
services. ``Spread pricing'' is a risk-based contracting model in which 
employers choose to let the pharmacy benefit company hold the risk that 
plan participants may use more expensive pharmacies to acquire drugs in 
exchange for the option to keep the savings when a patient uses a less 
expensive pharmacy, as well as to take a loss when they use costlier 
pharmacies. Today, employers can choose spread pricing or ``pass-
through'' contracting, in which the plan sponsor pays whatever the 
pharmacy charges. While larger employers typically select pass-through 
contracts, as they have the scale to deal with the variability of 
pharmacy charges, smaller employers often choose spread contracts 
because of the pricing predictability and savings they derive. This 
bill would mandate pass-through contracting with employers, prohibiting 
employers from designing their own PBM contractual compensation model, 
and could dramatically increase their administrative costs. Health 
plans should not be deprived of the right to make that choice.
    This bill also provides states with enforcement authority that is 
outside the scope of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 1974 
(ERISA), thereby eroding ERISA protections.
This Bill Includes Significant Technical Issues
    A number of more technical concerns are inherent in the proposed 
legislation. For example, it assumes PBMs are negotiating directly with 
pharmacies; however, approximately 83 percent of independent pharmacies 
contract with powerful pharmacy services administrative organizations 
(PSAOs) to negotiate pharmacy network contracts and perform many 
fundamental administrative operations on their behalf. Further, 
pharmacies and PSAOs are always informed of reimbursement rates as a 
matter of standard operating procedure. There are no surprises. The 
bill also would require disclosure to a pharmacy of spread pricing, 
which is unnecessary as the amount the health plan pays its pharmacy 
benefit company does not impact the pharmacy's reimbursement, which 
could be higher or lower.
    The bill would also require PBM reporting if a PBM moved a drug to 
a lower formulary tier, or a drug had a higher cost, or resulted in 
lower reimbursement to a pharmacy. Under longstanding Federal law and 
guidance, plans are encouraged to make positive formulary changes, 
which benefit Exchange and Part D plan enrollees, and reduce overall 
program costs by encouraging generic and biosimilar substitution. 
Disclosing these changes to the pharmacies could impact the incentive 
structure, causing a decrease in substitution of lower-cost 
alternatives in place of expensive brand drugs, contrary to this 
Administration's and the Congress's stated objective to foster a 
competitive market for biosimilars and other prescription drugs.
This Bill Would Increase Costs and Facilitate Pharmacy Fraud
    Beyond increased consumer costs due to tacit collusion, the 
expansion of the powers of the FTC encompassed in this bill would 
almost certainly increase taxpayer costs given the additional oversight 
and enforcement authority, expanded focus, and need to coordinate with 
numerous state attorneys general and other state officials.
    Adding to costs for taxpayers, businesses, states, and the 
Commission, the private right of action in section 5(b) would allow 
pharmacists to turn every matter of dissatisfaction into a lawsuit, 
generating an exorbitant amount of litigation from pharmacies for 
things that are ordinary contract elements today. For example, recent 
Part D regulatory changes that go into effect in 2024 require PBMs to 
change payments to pharmacies. This bill would give pharmacies the 
ability to submit legal claims against PBMs for complying with Medicare 
rules.
    Another cost increase would stem from limitations on pharmacy 
audits. The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association (NHCAA) 
estimates billions of dollars in annual financial losses due to health 
care fraud.<SUP>xi</SUP> The HHS Office of the Inspector General 
routinely investigates and prosecutes providers, including pharmacies, 
for fraudulent activities and makes significant economic recoveries on 
behalf of Medicare and Medicaid programs. Private actors should be able 
to take these actions and make these recoveries, as well. The 
restrictions this bill seeks to place on ``clawbacks'' would encompass 
audits and recoveries, which have long been established as appropriate 
and necessary business practices. In addition to fraud, waste, and 
abuse, pharmacy audits have exposed inventory discrepancies, unwanted 
auto-refills and shipping of medications, claim submissions for 
medications not dispensed or prescribed, claims submissions for 
medications not requested by patients, and intentional billing for one 
product while dispensing another. Health benefit plans are required to 
audit all providers, including pharmacies, and given that contracts are 
between PBMs and pharmacies, they delegate pharmacy audits to PBMs. 
PBMs utilize varying types of audits, from in-person to completely 
remote, and use best business practices consistent with audits across 
the health care industry to minimize abrasion. This bill would tie 
pharmacy benefit companies' hands in fighting fraud, waste, abuse, and 
drug diversion by preventing PBMs from recovering funds from pharmacy 
audits when a pharmacy claims that the recovery is unfair, deceptive, 
or arbitrary--a word that does not have a clear legal application in 
this instance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
    PBMs have always focused on lowering drug costs for patients and 
health plans.
    The Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act takes a biased 
approach against one aspect of the pharmaceutical supply and payment 
chain and will not lower prescription drug costs. Any true attempt at 
understanding the factors driving costs must include a look at the 
broader supply chain including PSAOs, pharmacy wholesalers, 
manufacturer wholesalers, employer benefit consultants, pharmacies, and 
others with impact on the cost of prescription drugs. PCMA agrees that 
policymakers need information that exposes the factors driving up 
prescription drug costs for consumers and continues to support the 
``Prescription Drug Pricing for the People Act,'' sponsored by Senators 
Grassley, Cantwell, Blackburn, Blumenthal, Braun, Capito, Lankford, 
Tillis, and Tuberville, which does not point fingers at a single 
entity, and instead examines multiple parties in the pharmaceutical 
supply chain to evaluate anticompetitive practices.
    PCMA would be happy to provide additional information to the 
Committee on the value pharmacy benefit companies bring to patients, 
health plan sponsors, and society, and looks forward to working 
collaboratively with Congress and other stakeholders to build on the 
existing private market framework to make medications more affordable 
and accessible for patients.

Hon. Maria Cantwell,
Chair,
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
Washington, DC.

Hon. Ted Cruz,
Ranking Member,
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
Washington, DC.

Dear Chairwoman Cantwell and Ranking Member Cruz:

    On behalf of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (Society), 
thank you for holding the hearing entitled ``Bringing Transparency and 
Accountability to Pharmacy Benefit Managers''. We appreciate this 
hearing's focus on examining the role that pharmacy benefit managers 
(PBMs) play in the American healthcare system. People with MS need more 
information to make educated choices about their health insurance and 
the medications they need to live their best lives. Unfortunately, PBMs 
currently operate in the middle of the pharmaceutical distribution 
chain and very little information is available for patients and 
regulators to utilize in healthcare decision-making. The Society is 
pleased to endorse S.127, the Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act 
and support its goal to bring more transparency into PBM business 
practices and prohibit unfair or deceptive practices that drive up 
costs for patients.
    Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable, often disabling, 
disease of the central nervous system, which interrupts the flow of 
information within the brain and between the brain and the body. 
Symptoms range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis. 
The progression, severity, and specific symptoms of MS in any one 
person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in research and treatment 
are moving us closer to a world free of MS. The Society works to cure 
MS while empowering people affected by MS to live their best lives. To 
fulfill this mission, we fund cutting-edge research, drive change 
through advocacy, facilitate professional education, collaborate with 
MS organizations around the world, and provide services designed to 
help people affected by MS move their lives forward.
    MS is a highly expensive disease. The average total cost of living 
with MS is $88,487 per year.<SUP>i</SUP> The total estimated cost to 
the U.S. economy is $85.4 billion per year, and the direct medical cost 
to live with MS is an average of $65,612 more than a person who does 
not live with MS.<SUP>ii</SUP> Evidence demonstrates that early and 
ongoing treatment with a MS disease-modifying therapy (DMT) is the best 
way to manage the disease course, prevent the accumulation of 
disability, and protect the brain from damage due to MS.<SUP>iii</SUP> 
There are now more than twenty DMTs on the market, including generic 
options, and these medications have transformed the treatment of MS 
over the last 29 years. Unfortunately, these DMTs are incredibly 
expensive. The annual cost for individuals on an MS DMT ranges from 
$57,202 to $92,719, depending on an individual's age and gender 
<SUP>iv</SUP> and people with MS stay on these medications for years.

MS <SUP>v</SUP> and, as MS presents differently in each person, every 
person's response to a DMT will vary. It is common for people with MS 
to move through several different DMTs throughout their life as they 
may ``break-through'' on a medication, or have disease activity, and 
need to try a different DMT.

The Role of PBMs in the U.S. Healthcare system and trajectory of MS DMT 
        prices
    PBMs have played an increasingly important--but often hidden--role 
in the U.S healthcare system. PBMs manage prescription drug benefits 
for health insurers, Medicare Part D drug plans, large employers, and 
other payors. While initially created in the 1960s to help control the 
cost of prescription drugs, their role has evolved and today they are 
powerful, but hidden, players in the American healthcare system. PBMs 
play a fundamental role in determining the cost of prescription drugs 
for payors, influencing the access to medication that people with MS 
and other patients need, and determining how much pharmacies are paid 
for these medications.
    When the first MS DMT came to market in 1993, the price range was 
$8,000 to $11,000 for one year of treatment. The price of MS therapies 
has dramatically risen since that time. The annual median price for MS 
DMTs has increased nearly $34,000 in less than 10 years. As of January 
2023 (see appendix I), the median annual price of brand MS DMTs is 
close to $98,000. While not identical, most brand MS DMTs have seen 
similar pricing trajectories which are not sustainable for people with 
MS or the U.S. healthcare system. Cost increases have also impacted MS 
symptom management medications. For example, H.P. ActharGel (Acthar), 
approved in 1952, is used as a short-term treatment for acute 
exacerbations of MS. For years, this medication was priced at less than 
$40 per vial. However, today, a vial of Acthar is priced at around 
$40,000-approximately 140,000 percent more expensive than when it was 
approved 68 years ago.<SUP>vi</SUP> The price increases and additional 
out-of-pocket costs associated with these medications present real 
hurdles and barriers to people affected by MS.

PBMs role in formulary development and restrictions to access
    PBMs play a significant role in the access that people with MS have 
to their DMTs and symptom management. As costs have increased, health 
plans and PBMs employ increasingly strict utilization management 
practices to minimize the use and cost liability for these therapies. 
These practices present significant hurdles for prescribers and real 
barriers for people with MS. While PBMs often cite part of their role 
as keeping pharmaceutical and health costs down, there are documented 
examples that PBM practices can add costs to the healthcare system 
overall and inhibit patient care. For example, physicians in the United 
States complete an average of 33 prior authorization requests every 
week, taking an average of 14.4 hours to process.<SUP>vii</SUP>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Too often, formularies designed by PBMs, and health insurers are 
driven not by medical practice, but by rebates in the system. For 
example, according to a 2020 staff report from the House Committee on 
Oversight and Reform, Teva Pharmaceuticals exerted pressure on PBMs by 
tying contractual rebates on Copaxone 20 mg/ml to adding Copaxone 40 
mg/ml to their formularies.<SUP>viii</SUP>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There is often little transparency into how formularies or step 
therapy protocols are developed, especially for MS DMTs, where there 
are no publicly available algorithms describing how to progress through 
the different MS DMTs. In 2019, in response to a Society funded survey, 
people with MS reported that the greatest challenge in getting DMTs 
comes from insurance companies.<SUP>ix</SUP> Through the years, people 
with MS and their healthcare providers have described egregious step 
therapy practices and prior authorization delays that have resulted in 
MS exacerbations, worsening health, and increased costs to the 
healthcare system. Examples of these practices include requiring three 
to five DMTs to fail a person with MS prior to accessing the 
individual's medication of choice, requiring someone to use a DMT they 
already know does not work for them, and requiring people with needle 
phobia to use self-injectable medications even though oral medications 
are available. Rather than ``getting the right medication to the right 
person'' as the industry describes, these practices result in 
nonadherence and dangerous delays to people getting on the DMTs that 
will work for them. With every delay, people with MS risk disease 
activity and underlying progression from which they may not recover.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Additionally, increasing vertical integration of PBMs and payors, 
rebating, and other business-related practices often result in 
formulary placement of medications that often steers individuals 
towards more expensive medications, while generics and biosimilars are 
available. For example, PBMs often place generic drugs and biosimilars 
in higher formulary tiers alongside brand medications, thus negating 
the cost savings to the health system and the patient. We have seen 
this practice in the MS space, as MS generics, due to higher cost than 
regular generic medications, are covered more like specialty 
medications, resulting in higher cost sharing for people with MS. 
Likewise, a PBM may prefer a higher cost drug because it will increase 
their revenue so, despite lower cost alternatives being available, a 
higher cost product receives favorable formulary placement. We believe 
that the choice of therapy for people with MS should be between the 
patient and their healthcare provider, and the profit margin of the PBM 
should not be relevant in the decision.
Policy Changes To Promote Transparency and Accountability are Needed
    There is increased pressure on people with MS and other chronic 
health conditions to make good choices about the cost of their care and 
prescription drug medications, yet there is very little true 
transparency throughout the healthcare system, and people often have 
very little information about price and cost to guide these decisions. 
We believe that S.127, the Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act is 
a good first step to increase transparency to help people affected by 
MS understand why formularies are designed the way they are, prohibit 
unfair PBM business practices, incentivize those practices that are 
fair and promote transparency, protect patients, and have an 
enforcement mechanism that will bring about change.
    The Society's full set of policy recommendations for PBM reform is 
outlined below. We realize that some of these recommendations fall 
outside this Committee's jurisdiction, but we urge you to pass S.127 
out of Committee and work with your colleagues to advance PBM reform 
this Congress to ensure all patients have access to the life-changing 
therapies they need to live their best lives.

  <bullet> Ensures transparency by requiring disclosure of specific 
        costs, prices, reimbursements, fees, mark ups, discounts and 
        aggregate payments received with respect to their PBM service.

  <bullet> Prohibits unfair and deceptive pricing models including 
        spread-pricing and arbitrary claw backs of payments.

  <bullet> Requires pass-through pricing models.

  <bullet> Requires oversight and reporting on PBM behavior and allows 
        FTC to take legal action when a PBM is found in violation of 
        the law.

  <bullet> Allows for patients to have a choice of the pharmacy where 
        they receive their medications.

  <bullet> Allows patients to receive the benefits from rebated savings 
        and pay the lesser amount of copay/co-insurance, the amount 
        charged by the PBM to the pharmacy, or the cost of the drug.

  <bullet> Includes a substantial monetary penalty for those PBMs who 
        act in violation of the law.

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to 
                            Dr. Ryan Oftebro
    Question 1. I have heard from pharmacists who are afraid to speak 
out against PBMs for fear of retaliation. Are you concerned that by 
speaking out you may be opening yourself up to arbitrary and 
detrimental actions on the part of PBMs?
    Answer. Yes, I am very concerned about retaliation from PBMs. 
Elimination from the network by even one of the three major PBMs would 
be catastrophic to our practice. Within days of my testimony to the 
Committee, we received notification of large on-site audits from two 
major PBMs. While we periodically receive desk audits on single claims, 
it is highly unusual (and very burdensome) to receive two major onsite 
audits in the same week.

    Question 2. During the hearing, you were asked to describe 
anticompetitive tactics used by PBMs. Do you have additional examples 
you can provide? How have those tactics affected your pharmacy 
business?
    Answer. Yes, our pharmacy has experienced many additional examples 
of PBM anticompetitive tactics, such as:

        No mailing clauses--many of the major PBMs have contract 
        clauses that expressly forbid pharmacies from mailing to 
        patients, even if the pharmacy chooses not to charge a mailing 
        fee. PBMs will routinely conduct audits on claims by zip code. 
        If a pharmacy fills a prescription for a patient that is 
        outside an arbitrary radius determined by the PBM, the pharmacy 
        must produce a patient signature indicating that the 
        prescription was picked up in person. Failing to do so will 
        result in the recoupment of payment for the prescription.

        Withholding contracts--Major PBMs are now withholding contracts 
        from new pharmacy locations. When we opened a new location last 
        fall, inside a clinic serving chronically homeless and highly 
        vulnerable populations, we were told that we must demonstrate 
        that we have been in business for at least 6 months before we 
        could apply for a contract. Another large PBM told us that the 
        wait would be 12 months, however we could shorten the time-
        frame with a $2000 fee. We were simply adding a location to an 
        existing business within their network, however they refused to 
        accommodate us. When the three largest PBMs control 80 percent 
        of the market, it is impossible to establish a sustainable 
        business without access to these contracts for any period of 
        time.

        Anti-competitive rates--Our pharmacies are seeing contract 
        rates from major PBMs that are well below our cost to purchase, 
        despite the fact that we are able to purchase drugs through our 
        buying group at extremely competitive rates. The PBM 
        reimbursement rates reflect prices that are not available 
        anywhere in the legitimate market, without even accounting for 
        retroactive fees.

        Take it or leave it contracts--We have made numerous attempts 
        to negotiate rates and other undesirable terms with PBMs and 
        the answer is consistently no. We recently opened a new 
        location and requested to contract with one of the large PBMs. 
        They provided reimbursement rates that were well below any 
        pharmacy's net acquisition costs. We respectfully requested a 
        contract of NADAC (National Drug Acquisition Cost) and they 
        refused. They said if we changed our minds we could sign the 
        original contract they provided. On the single occasion a PBM 
        has responded to our request to renegotiate rates, we were 
        given a fraction of a percentage increase for one year, which 
        had negligible impact on the overall rate, which was still well 
        below our cost to purchase.

        Underpay, then offer to buy pharmacy--We frequently receive 
        solicitations from vertically integrated pharmacy chains to 
        purchase our pharmacy. In their letters, they cite the economic 
        pressures of PBM reimbursements, including DIR fees which come 
        from the very same vertically integrated entity, as reasons to 
        sell.

        Deceptive communications to patients/pharmacies/physicians--We 
        frequently hear from patients that they receive calls and 
        letters from their PBM indicating that we are not in network 
        and they need to transfer to the PBM owned pharmacy, when we in 
        fact are in network. This often now happens as a text that is 
        received by the patient immediately after filling a 
        prescription, attempting to steer them to their own pharmacy 
        for their next fill, including deceptive language and a link to 
        click to initiate the transfer. We also receive transfer 
        requests from PBM owned pharmacies that patients report never 
        having initiated. Doctor's offices have also shared with us 
        that they consistently receive prescription requests from 
        vertically integrated pharmacies (not used by the patient) 
        attempting to steer fills from our pharmacy and others. It 
        seems that the only way the vertically integrated pharmacy 
        would have this data would be from the vertically integrated 
        PBM.

        Specialty steering--Our pharmacy treats a large population of 
        people living with HIV. We had a major PBM communicate to us 
        that they were moving all medications to treat HIV to 
        specialty, and that we would be removed from the network for 
        these medications unless we became specialty accredited, which 
        involved leaving our PSAO (the entity that assists pharmacies 
        with contracting) and sign a direct contract with the PBM, pay 
        the PBM thousands of dollars in fees and achieve third party 
        accreditation. We were required to do all of this BEFORE they 
        would let us see a specialty contract. Upon completing the 
        requirements, we were given a much lower reimbursing contract, 
        with rates well below our cost to purchase HIV medications. The 
        same PBM has continued to arbitrarily move HIV medications on 
        and off their specialty list for their own economic advantage. 
        Additionally, this specialty requirement was not applied to 
        other network pharmacies in our area, only ours. We believe we 
        were targeted in an attempt to steer these patients to the PBMs 
        own pharmacy.

    Question 3. As an owner of an independent pharmacy, have you ever 
bid on a contract to provide pharmacy services to a health plan? Do you 
know whether your contract bid faced competition from a pharmacy owned 
by a PBM? Would those situations raise any anticompetitive concerns? If 
so, please describe those concerns.
    Answer. Yes. For many years we had a direct contract to provide 
pharmacy services to a large Labor Union in Washington state. The 
trustees for the Union and their benefits consultant put the contract 
for the PBM services as well as for the pharmacy services out to bid. 
The incumbent PBM had all of our data and was able to utilize that data 
to win the contract for both the PBM and the pharmacy services (PBM 
owned pharmacy).

    Question 4. In his written testimony, Dr. Mulligan referred to a 
research paper he prepared, ``The Value of Pharmacy Benefit 
Management,'' (July 2022). In that paper, Dr. Mulligan stated that mail 
pharmacies, many of which are sponsored by PBMs, ``can reduce patient 
costs and increase patient convenience, both of which encourage 
utilization[;]'' and ``increase medication adherence.'' Assuming that 
mail pharmacies can increase patient convenience and medication 
adherence, does your pharmacy provide medications by mail? If not, why?
    Answer. We have been contractually prohibited from mailing to 
patients by several major PBMs. Where this practice is not prohibited, 
we happily offer mailing. Many patients prefer to have our pharmacy 
mail their prescriptions over their mail order benefit, as they report 
much higher customer service levels, and they report receiving 
medications much faster when mailed from a local pharmacy than the PBM 
owned pharmacies that are typically out of state.

    Question 5. You described in your testimony how a PBM moving a 
generic cholesterol medication from the lowest copay tier to the 
second-highest tier increased patients' copay to almost ten times what 
they paid before. Did the PBM offer an explanation for why it changed 
this drug's copay tier? Do these price hikes for consumers cause 
consumers to take medications less than they need to, or stop taking 
them altogether, because they've become too expensive?
    Answer. The PBM in this example offered no explanation to the 
pharmacy, and as far as we know, offered no explanation to patients why 
they were suddenly being required to pay nearly 10 times the cost of 
the medication. Feedback from patients indicated that this was clearly 
an economic burden that was requiring them to make difficult decisions. 
These were Medicare part D beneficiaries, many of them on fixed 
incomes. These patients would be inappropriately incentivized to ration 
medications, resulting in sub-therapeutic doses, or having to choose 
between paying for their medications and their other bills, groceries, 
etc.
    We also frequently see PBMs require a brand medication to be filled 
when a cheaper generic is available. The PBMs rationale for this 
practice has to do with rebates they extract from the brand 
manufacturer, which they argue makes the brand medication more cost 
effective for the plan. Unfortunately, many patients do not receive 
this benefit, as they are frequently still required to pay a higher 
brand co-pay instead of the less expensive generic co-pay.

    Question. In your opinion, do PBMs tend to prioritize cost savings 
over the judgement and experience of medical professionals? Can you 
provide any additional examples of the impact PBM cost-cutting measures 
have had on your patients and their care?

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Shelley Moore Capito to 

                             Dr. Debra Patt
    Bringing transparency to the practices of pharmacy benefit managers 
and copay accumulator programs is something that patients have long 
been calling for. My state was one the first to prohibit copay 
accumulator programs and is one of the unfortunately low number of 
states to do so. By banning copay accumulators, we ensure that patients 
aren't blindsided when picking up their prescriptions, and the results 
have been beneficial for West Virginians.

    Question 1. Dr. Patt, can you explain the involvement of PBMs in 
``accumulator adjustment'' and why states like mine are banning the 
practice?
    Answer. (Did not receive a response).

    Question 2. Dr. Patt, why hasn't the Federal Government pursued a 
copay accumulator ban in line with what states are already doing?
    Answer. (Did not receive a response).

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to 
                             Dr. Erin Trish
    Question 1. There seems to be a problem with the incentives that 
motivate PBMs' decision-making. As an example, PBMs may contract with 
insurance companies to keep a percentage of the rebates, which are 
based on list prices. Does this create an incentive for manufacturers 
to maintain high list prices or inflate list prices for drugs if they 
want to be approved by PBMs?
    Answer. If PBMs and other supply chain intermediaries are paid as a 
share of the list price of a drug (or a share of the negotiated 
rebate), that produces an incentive for those intermediaries to prefer 
drugs with higher list prices and larger rebates over low-list-price, 
low-rebate drugs. For example, take the case of authorized generics, 
which are exact copies of brand name drugs that are marketed without 
the brand name on their label. In several instances in recent years, 
manufacturers have introduced authorized generics at significantly 
reduced list prices, even years before expected generic competition. 
For example, this strategy has been used for hepatitis C treatments 
(Harvoni and Epclusa) in 2018 and insulin (Humalog and Novolog) in 2019 
and 2020, respectively. However, one study found that only 3-4 percent 
of Medicare Part D beneficiaries were enrolled in plans that covered 
only these authorized generics, despite their having 50 percent+ lower 
list prices, even though covering them would have resulted in lower 
out-of-pocket spending for beneficiaries. This type of evidence 
demonstrates the incentives for high-list-price, high-rebate drugs in 
practice.

    Question 2. Do you believe greater transparency in pricing would do 
more than just protect consumers--that it would also spur increased 
innovation in drug research and development? Does the current structure 
of the market incent PBMs to focus on profits over innovation? How 
might incentives be structured to improve transparency and ensure a 
level of competition that leads to cost savings and innovation?
    Answer. Schaeffer Center research indicates that, in 2015, for 
every $100 spent on prescription drugs at retail pharmacies, $41 went 
to intermediaries in the distribution system, including PBMs. More 
recent Schaeffer Center research has shown that the portion of insulin 
spending retained by intermediaries increased from 30 percent of 
spending in 2014 to 53 percent of spending in 2018. Consequently, a 
smaller share of expenditures is accruing to manufacturers over time, 
with likely effects on innovation and investments in research and 
development. Policy that instead rewards manufacturers for demonstrated 
real-world value of their products, rather than contracting incentives, 
could better promote innovation and value.

    Question 3. Does the practice of claw backs help us understand who 
has market power in the prescription drug market?
    Answer. Pharmacy price concessions--or clawbacks--in Medicare Part 
D increased over 1000 percent from 2010 to 2020, totaling $9.5B in 
2020, or nearly 5 percent of total Part D spending. Additional research 
is needed to determine the extent to which this trend reflects market 
power of PBMs vs. pharmacies, but the growth is nonetheless striking.

    Question 4. In your opinion, how difficult would it be for PBMs to 
comply with the transparency requirements of this legislation?
    Answer. I cannot speak to the specific difficulty of compliance 
with the transparency requirements of S. 127. However, given my 
understanding of the industry, it seems reasonable that PBMs should be 
able to produce the parameters subject to transparency requirements--
such as the spread or difference between the amount paid to the 
pharmacy and the amount charged to the health plan for a given drug. 
PBMs surely collect these measures already, to be used internally for 
business purposes; any additional effort to comply would therefore not 
involve new data collection or calculation, but only new reporting of 
those measures to outside parties. Moreover, it is my understanding 
that some of the transparency requirements--such as the aggregate total 
amount of reimbursements the PBM clawed back from pharmacies--are 
similar to existing metrics that are required to be reported in certain 
business lines, such as pharmacy ``DIR'' fees in Medicare Part D.

    Question 5. When a consumer sees the out-of-pocket price of their 
prescription skyrocket, are they able to get a full explanation from 
their doctor, insurer, or pharmacist? Does any market actor have 
visibility and control over the complete drug pricing process?
    Answer. I am not in a position to be able to answer this 
definitively in all instances, but my understanding is that it is 
generally not possible for any one player in the prescription drug 
market to have complete visibility and control over the drug pricing 
process. Indeed, even PBMs, which sit at the nexus of negotiations 
between manufacturers, health plans/employers, and pharmacies do not 
have complete insight into this because, for example, they generally do 
not know the pharmacy's drug acquisition costs.

    Question 6. It has been asserted that PBMs provide value to 
insurance plans because the pharmacy market is highly concentrated with 
just three major pharmacies controlling 60 percent of the market, and 
PBMs provide the power of a ``buyer's club'' to help insurance 
companies overcome this imbalance and get the lowest possible prices so 
they can keep their rates low for consumers. Yet, the top three PBMs 
control 80 percent of the PBM market. Does this line of reasoning 
indicate that insurance companies would be better off negotiating with 
pharmacies than they would be negotiating with PBMs, since PBMs appear 
to have even more market power than the pharmacies do? Is it possible 
that many insurance companies have no choice but to work with PBMs, 
since PBMs dominate the market that insurance companies do business in?
    Answer. The notion of PBMs benefitting consumers via the ``buyer's 
club'' model is inconsistent with empirical evidence. Take Costco as an 
example. Schaeffer Center research demonstrates that--when compared 
with the ``buyer's club'' prices available at Costco pharmacies for 
common generic drugs--Medicare Part D plans overpaid on 43 percent of 
prescriptions in 2018, totaling $2.6 billion in overspending in that 
year alone. That is, this evidence suggests that the inefficiencies 
introduced by the typical PBM and insurance market model do not deliver 
savings to consumers on par with the buyer's club market, at least for 
common generic drugs.
    Additionally, each of the large PBMs operate a specialty pharmacy, 
while some PBMs are also affiliated with retail pharmacy chains (e.g., 
CVS). So, even if plans were to negotiate with pharmacies directly, 
market power in the PBM market could still be extended to the pharmacy 
market via this vertical integration.

      Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ted Cruz to 
                             Dr. Erin Trish
Medicare Part D Rebate Rule
    Dr. Trish, in 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services 
proposed a rule to eliminate an existing safe harbor within Medicare 
Part D and Medicaid that allowed PBMs to negotiate rebates paid by drug 
manufacturers to health plans and PBMs. CBO and the CMS's Office of the 
Actuary estimated that eliminating this rebate negotiating ability 
alone would increase Federal spending by about $170 billion over 10 
years and result in an estimated 25 percent increase in Medicare 
premiums.

    Question 1. Do you agree with these economic findings? And does any 
of the economic modeling used by CBO and CMS apply to an economic 
analysis of the PBM Transparency Act (S. 127)? Why or why not?
    Answer. The 2019 proposed rule would have removed the safe harbor 
exemption for rebates applied after the point-of-sale and established a 
new safe harbor that would enable pharmaceutical manufacturers to offer 
reduced prices when they are applied at the point-of-sale. In effect, 
this would allow beneficiary cost-sharing to be calculated using 
manufacturer net, rather than list, prices.
    The projected increase in Federal spending referenced above 
therefore reflects two primary factors. The first is that the rule 
change would have lowered aggregate beneficiary out-of-pocket spending, 
because beneficiary cost-sharing under the standard benefit design in 
Medicare Part D is effectively tied to the list price of drugs. As 
rebates have grown in Part D--from 11.7 percent of spending in 2013 to 
27.0 percent of spending in 2020--list prices are increasingly inflated 
relative to the manufacturer's net price of drugs. This dynamic has 
caused the Part D benefit to become less generous as a share of net 
drug costs, as patients pay more out of pocket. The 2019 proposed rule 
would have restored the generosity of the Part D benefit by tying cost-
sharing to net rather than list prices. This, in turn, would have 
increased Federal spending by increasing Part D subsidies because these 
subsidies are set by statute as a percentage of program spending. Thus, 
the change would have increased plan generosity and reduced beneficiary 
out-of-pocket spending, increasing program costs and therefore 
subsidies.
    The second is driven by assumptions about how manufacturers and 
other actors would respond to such a policy change in terms of the 
magnitude of rebates. The CBO and CMS OACT estimates described above 
reflect an assumption that manufacturer rebates would be reduced by 15 
percent in Medicare Part D. I am not privy to how CBO and CMS OACT 
arrived at those assumptions, but alternative assumptions--such as 
those modeled in an analysis conducted by Milliman prepared for the 
Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services--projected potential federal savings from the 
rule. In the Federal Register, DHHS noted that they engaged multiple 
analyses from OACT and actuarial firms precisely because ``it is 
difficult to predict manufacturer and Part D plan behavior in response 
to this regulation.''
    My understanding of the PBM Transparency Act (S. 127) is that it 
would essentially create two compliance options (in addition to the 
transparency and other requirements). Pharmacy benefit mangers (PBMs) 
would be prohibited from engaging in spread pricing or arbitrarily, 
unfairly, or deceptively imposing clawbacks; or, they could continue 
with these practices if they pass all rebates to health plans or payers 
and comply with additional disclosure requirements.
    First, CBO would likely need to make assumptions regarding how the 
market would distribute across these two compliance options. Second, 
the provisions here are different than the so-called rebate rule for a 
number of reasons, including the markets to which they would apply. 
While the modeling of the rebate rule may inform CBO's estimates, I 
expect other CBO analyses may also be equally if not more relevant. For 
example, in 2019, CBO scored the Lower Health Care Costs Act. Section 
306 would have required PBMs operating in commercial health care 
markets to (in short) provide information on costs, aggregate rebates, 
and fees; fully pass rebates, fees, discounts, or other remuneration to 
plan sponsors; and prohibit spread pricing. CBO estimated these 
provisions would reduce average premiums in the private insurance 
market and decrease the deficit by $1.7 billion over the 2019-2029 
period.
PBM Transparency Act Effect on Consumers
    During the hearing, Dr. Mulligan testified that the requirements in 
the PBM Transparency Act (S. 127) could increase consumer health 
premiums in the aggregate by about $10 billion.

    Question 1. Do you agree or disagree with Dr. Mulligan? Why or Why 
not?
    Answer. I have not seen an estimate of nor independently estimated 
the impact of the complete provisions of the PBM Transparency Act (S. 
127) on consumer health insurance premiums, so I cannot directly answer 
this question. However, as noted above, in 2019 CBO estimated that the 
provisions of Section 306 in the Lower Health Care Costs Act would have 
reduced average premiums in the private insurance market (by about 0.2 
percent in the first full year of implementation, and by 0.02 percent 
by 2029). There are differences in the provisions of these two bills--
including the markets to which they would apply--so this should not 
necessarily be construed as a direct estimate of the likely effects of 
S. 127 on premiums, but is informative nonetheless.

    Question 2. Relatedly, Dr. Mulligan also testified that the 
requirements in S. 127, including the disclosure requirements, could 
increase PBM consolidation with greater benefit to larger, vertically 
integrated PBMs with higher barriers to entry for potential competitors 
and smaller PBMs potentially being forced to close their doors. Do you 
agree or disagree with Dr. Mulligan? Why or Why not?
    Answer. In general, it is likely that larger organizations, 
including PBMs, could more readily shoulder increased costs of 
compliance than smaller competitors. On the other hand, to the extent 
that vertical integration is benefitting firms more than consumers, it 
is possible that disclosure requirements could shed light on these 
practices, in turn benefitting smaller competitors. For example, 
transparency requirements such as those requiring that PBMs that 
control or are affiliated with a pharmacy to provide a description of 
differences between what they reimburse or charge affiliated or 
nonaffiliated pharmacies would, by definition, not be imposed on 
smaller PBMs that are not affiliated with a pharmacy, but would provide 
insight into whether such vertical integration may raise competitive 
concerns.
PBM Transparency Act Disclosure Requirements
    Dr. Trish, in your testimony you noted that prescription drug 
markets are complicated and a mystery for Americans and, ``where there 
is mystery, there is margin.'' Transparency can be an important tool to 
drive competition, but certain transparency requirements could also, as 
the FTC and DOJ have previously warned, cause unintended consequences.

    Question 1. Do you agree with Dr. Mulligan's assessment that the 
disclosure requirements in S. 127 require the disclosure of proprietary 
information? If not, why not?
    Answer. I can't provide a specific interpretation of whether the 
provisions of S. 127 would require the disclosure of proprietary 
information. However, I think the warning of Harvard Professors Anna 
Sinaiko and Meredith Rosenthal in the New England Journal of Medicine 
is relevant: ``How long are payers and policymakers willing to wait to 
see whether market-based transparency initiatives will work before 
moving to other, potentially more onerous, polices, such as increased 
regulation?''

    Question 2. Would collusion in the prescription drug market become 
more likely when disclosing proprietary information in highly 
concentrated markets like health care?
    Answer. I do not believe so. Recent policy efforts have marked a 
shift toward increased price disclosure in health care markets, such as 
increased hospital price transparency and insurer price transparency, 
both of which require disclosure of prices net of negotiated discounts 
off of charges or list prices.
    It is also worth noting that one of the often-cited empirical 
examples related to these concerns about disclosure leading to 
potential price increases is a study of the early 1990s Danish ready-
mix concrete industry. As Prof. Per B. Overgaard--one of the study's 
authors--noted: ``I'm sure there are some similarities between pricing 
of various health care services and ready-made concrete in Denmark in 
the early 1990s, but I'm also sure there might be huge differences.''

    Question 3. What would the likely effect of the transparency/
disclosure requirements in S. 127 have on the profits of other actors 
in the prescription drug supply chain, including drug manufacturers, 
wholesalers, retailers, PSAOs, and pharmacies?
    Answer. I can't speak to the specific provisions of S. 127, but in 
general it is very difficult for buyers to make efficient purchasing 
decisions when they do not know the prices they are facing. To the 
extent that transparency or disclosure requirements provide buyers with 
a clearer picture of the prices they are facing, they can make better 
buying decisions.

    Question 4. Could the specific disclosure requirements in S. 127 
hinder competition in the industry in other ways, such as putting 
smaller PBMs at a competitive disadvantage?
    Answer. As described above, it is possible that disclosure policies 
could differentially affect smaller versus larger and more vertically-
integrated competitors, but that could go in either direction.
    It is also worth noting an example of the ways that increased 
transparency in this market can benefit consumers. Information on PBM 
reimbursement to pharmacies is generally unavailable to researchers, 
but a short-lived 2013 Federal survey called National Average Retail 
Price (NARP) provided six months of visibility into these average 
pharmacy reimbursements. Schaeffer Center research used that survey to 
compare these average pharmacy reimbursements with patient copayments, 
finding that 23 percent of the prescriptions in a large sample of 
commercial claims involved a patient copayment that exceeded the cost 
to the PBM, or a so-called copay ``clawback.'' This evidence 
contradicted testimony from a PBM representative that PBMs did not 
support the practice of collecting patients' copay in excess of the 
cash price of the drug and that, if such practice happened, they were 
``outliers.'' Without the transparency provided by the NARP data, such 
a study would not have been possible.
FTC PBM Investigation
    In your testimony, you note that further investigation is warranted 
to better understand the myriad ways the current system harms consumers 
and reduces innovation--especially innovation that will lower costs for 
everyone. The FTC is currently studying PBM competition and the impacts 
on consumers.

    Question 1. Might that data from the FTC be beneficial in crafting 
legislative solutions to lowering drug prices?
    Answer. Yes. It is also possible that additional investigation--
such as through additional FTC, GAO, Congressional, academic, or other 
studies--could be useful in crafting future legislative solutions to 
improve value in prescription drug markets. I believe the value of such 
studies would be greater if they could be based on information and data 
that are not currently publicly available.
Rebate Influence on Drug List Prices
    In your testimony, you argue that rebates drive a wedge between a 
drug's list price and its net price and that increasing rebates are one 
of the key drivers of increasing list prices over time with an estimate 
from the Schaeffer Center that for $1 increase in estimated rebates, 
list prices increased $1.17 between 2015 and 2018.

    Question 1. Why do you believe the rebate is the cause of the 
increased list price instead of the increased list price driving the 
PBMs to negotiate a larger rebate? Could it be a combination of both? 
Why or why not?
    Answer. It is possible, but if the need for greater rebates is 
induced by high list prices (rather than the other way around), why 
would PBMs use formularies that exclude low-list-price, low-rebate 
drugs in favor of identical drugs with higher list prices and rebates? 
For example, take the case of authorized generics, which are exact 
copies of brand name drugs that are marketed without the brand name on 
their label. In several instances in recent years, manufacturers have 
introduced authorized generics at significantly reduced list prices, 
even years before expected generic competition. For example, this 
strategy has been used for hepatitis C treatments (Harvoni and Epclusa) 
in 2018 and insulin (Humalog and Novolog) in 2019 and 2020, 
respectively. However, one study found that only 3-4 percent of 
Medicare Part D beneficiaries were enrolled in plans that covered only 
these authorized generics, despite their having 50 percent+ lower list 
prices, even though covering them would have resulted in lower out-of-
pocket spending for beneficiaries. This type of evidence demonstrates 
the incentives for high-list-price, high-rebate drugs in practice.

      Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ted Cruz to 
                         Dr. Casey B. Mulligan
Rebate Influence on Drug List Prices
    In her testimony, Dr. Trish argues that rebates drive a wedge 
between a drug's list price and its net price and that increasing 
rebates are one of the key drivers of increasing list prices over time 
with an estimate from the Schaeffer Center that for $1 increase in 
estimated rebates, list prices increased $1.17 between 2015 and 2018.

    Question 1. Do you agree with Dr. Trish's argument? Why or Why not?
    Answer. Government-mandated rebates have a significant list-price 
increasing effect, but Dr. Trish's testimony about the $1.17 is 
incorrect and misleading if it is to be understood as a reference to 
rebates negotiated by plans or by PBMs on plans' behalf.
    Government-mandated rebates, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate 
Program, specify that the government (or plans on their behalf) 
purchase prescription drugs from manufacturers at a percentage of the 
list price in the commercial market. Such programs present 
manufacturers with the opportunity to get more government funds merely 
by increasing their list prices because the net price they receive from 
Medicaid is proportional to the list price by statute. The resulting 
list price increases could be much more than the amount of the rebate. 
Duggan and Scott-Morton (2006) found, in fact, very large list-price 
effects of mandated rebates.
    Negotiated rebates, by contrast, are an outcome of market 
competition and help magnify it. As such they reduce net prices, which 
is the difference between list price and the rebate, and the marginal 
prices that are an important disincentive for utilization. This pricing 
pattern is obvious as unique drugs begin to see new competitors enter, 
inducing the incumbent manufactures to begin paying significant rebates 
and receive lower net prices. Although not apparent from Dr. Trish's 
testimony, other Schaeffer Center studies have documented this 
competition-pricing pattern (Lakdawalla and Li, Association of Drug 
Rebates and Competition With Out-of-Pocket Coinsurance in Medicare Part 
D, 2014 to 2018 2021).
    In contrast to a scheme in which new entry merely reduced incumbent 
list prices with no rebate, the rebates are part of a pro-competitive 
partnership between manufacturers and plans to encourage utilization. 
Competition on rebates also saves consumers money, and cuts into 
manufacturer profits, relative to competition on list prices alone. As 
explained in my testimony, this is why volume discounts are not unique 
to the drug industry. Although not apparent from Dr. Trish's testimony, 
other Schaeffer Center studies have also documented the pro-competitive 
role of insurer negotiations with drug manufacturers in sharply 
reducing net and marginal prices and encouraging utilization 
(Lakdawalla and Philipson 2012, Lakdawalla and Sood 2013).
    The Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services concluded that negotiated rebates reduce net prices (84 FR 
2356). The paragraph in Dr. Trish's testimony does not specifically 
cite PBMs or negotiated rebates, but rather uses the more general term 
``rebates.'' The paragraph's position between others that do cite PBMs 
and/or negotiated rebates may give the false impression that the $1.17 
finding is a study of rebates negotiated by PBMs. In fact, the 
Schaeffer study, which acknowledges the substantial ``measurement 
error'' inherent in its attempt to infer rebates from company financial 
reports, pools many different types of rebates, including the 
government-mandated rebates with economics known to be opposite of 
negotiated rebates.
    Lacking the data necessary to eliminate all transactions that 
involve government-mandated rebates, the study authors are only able to 
eliminate some of them. The results of doing so are informative: the 
headline 1.17 estimate shown in their Table 2 falls 25 percent. In the 
analogous Table A4, merely eliminating some of the mandated 
transactions reduces the point estimate to 0.64 and the confidence 
interval down to 0.44. We can guess that eliminating all of the 
mandated transactions would reduce the estimates still further. Even 
without that, the study's estimate of 0.64 is well within the range of 
0.51-0.81 that I find in my analysis of rebates and net prices in 
insulin markets that was part of Table 1 of my submission of Restrict 
the Middleman? Quantitative Models of PBM Regulations and their 
Consequences into the record.
    If Dr. Trish's testimony about 1.17-to-1 were to be understood as a 
statement about negotiated rebates, it would seem that manufacturers 
would want the rebates because they purportedly increase net prices 
too. Instead, manufacturers have vigorously lobbied government to limit 
or even ban negotiated rebates (see footnote 2 of my testimony and the 
references therein), which is exactly what we expect when negotiated 
rebates have the effect of magnifying competition among manufacturers. 
Manufacturers--including but not limited to Abbott Labs, AbbVie, Amgen, 
Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Gilead, and Pfizer--have also generously funded 
the Schaeffer Center, as is acknowledged in their latest annual report.
    While negotiated rebates clearly reduce net prices, in some 
instances they reduce list prices too. As explained in Restrict the 
Middleman?, there is a tendency for rebates to reduce list prices 
because the rebates are tied to sales targets for the manufacturer 
paying the rebate. The additional sales frustrate competing 
manufacturers, forcing them to pay lower net prices too and sometimes 
also limiting their ability to raise list price. In other instances, 
especially with a convex demand curve, negotiated rebates may increase 
list prices even while they reduce net prices.
    Dr. Trish and the authors of the Schaeffer Center study also 
confuse correlation with causation. They estimate that list prices and 
rebates change in the same direction, but then discuss the results as 
if the rebates caused the list price changes (ergo, eliminating rebates 
would change the list prices back to where they were). They have not 
considered, among other things, that list-price increases caused the 
rebate increases. That is, list-price increases initiated by 
manufacturers induce plans and PBMs to obtain greater rebates as market 
pressures discourage them from agreeing to much addition to the net 
price.
    For example, as of the beginning of their sample period, Medicaid 
enrollment had just surged. Duggan and Scott-Morton's (2006) findings 
suggest that significant list-price increases would follow. The same 
model that I used to estimate the effects of S. 127 predicts that the 
result of such list-price increases would be negotiated rebates that 
increase almost one-for-one. That is, a near one-for-one effect of list 
prices on negotiated rebates is perfectly consistent with a much 
smaller--even negative--effect of rebates on list prices. The study 
authors are mistaken to assert that their ``finding that increased 
rebates are positively associated with increased list prices supports 
the notion that PBMs' demand for rebates is at least partly responsible 
for increased list prices.''

    Question 2. How does this data comport with your findings that S. 
127 could increase consumer drug prices?
    Answer. The economics of S. 127 is only indirectly related to any 
commentary on negotiated manufacturer rebates, including Dr. Trish's, 
because the economically important provisions in S. 127 are:

  <bullet> restrictions on pharmacy-company discounts (Sec. 2(a)),

  <bullet> PBM disclosure requirements (Secs. 2(b), 4), and

  <bullet> expanding the authority of the Federal Trade Commission 
        (Sec. 6).

    As explained in my testimony, the first two provisions would 
undermine competition in the drug-supply chain. The third provision 
affects pharmaceutical economics through the interpretation and 
enforcement of the first two.
    Sec 2(b)(1) of S. 127 does prohibit PBMs from retaining any price 
concessions. This provision does not prohibit rebates, although it 
would interfere to some degree with the capability and incentives of 
plans and PBMs to manage the drug benefit including the negotiation of 
volume discounts. Sec. 2(b)(1) may not apply to PBMs depending on how 
they choose to comply with the other sections of S. 127.
    S. 127 is even further from the issue of government-mandated 
rebates, which are driving the $1.17 estimate that Dr. Trish 
highlighted in her testimony. The economic model I use to estimate the 
effects of S. 127--exposited in Restrict the Middleman?--has not yet 
been used to analyze government-mandated rebates.
    A rigorous and coherent economic framework for PBM regulatory 
impact analysis, which neither Dr. Trish nor the Schaeffer Center have 
offered, would link negotiated manufacturer rebates to pharmacy 
discounts and disclosure requirements. As such, Dr. Trish's $1.17 
headline could be an indirect test of such a framework, at least if the 
$1.17 were purged of the effect of government-mandated rebates. The 
Schaeffer Center study steps part way in this direction in its Table 
A4, cutting the point estimate in about half to 0.64. 0.64 is well 
within the range of 0.51-0.81 that I find in my analysis of rebates and 
net prices in insulin markets that was part of Table 1 of Restrict the 
Middleman?.
    Overall, Dr. Trish's testimony gives the false impression that my 
findings are inconsistent with the statistics cited in her testimony, 
including but not limited to the $1.17. To the contrary, all those 
statistics support the quantitative economic model I use to analysze 
regulation of rebates, pharmacy DIR, disclosure requirements, and other 
aspects of PBM transactions. Indeed, the findings of some of the 
Schaeffer Center studies are integral to my approach, both 
qualitatively and quantitatively.
    To the extent that Dr. Trish reaches different conclusions than I 
do, the discrepancy derives from her unjustified and improper departure 
from the economic profession's standard approach to ``tax incidence,'' 
which refers to the distribution of the burden of a tax or regulation 
among the various market participants. Her unexplained departure is a 
ubiquitous theme in most of the questions and responses from the 
Ranking Member and other members (see below).
    According to economics, it is not enough to look merely at the 
legal obligations created by the regulation. Imposing a regulation on 
sellers, for example, may primarily harm buyers. Economics reaches 
conclusions about incidence by considering the alternative actions 
available to each participant that might allow them to mitigate their 
cost of compliance. Those alternative actions affect other market 
participants. In the case of a regulated seller, it may be able to 
raise the price or reduce the quality of the product and thereby 
largely maintain its profits. Meanwhile, the buyers are stuck with a 
higher price or lower quality. In this example, the buyers bear most of 
the burden of a regulation even though it imposes no legal obligation 
on them. Buyers are harmed because they are situated in the same market 
as someone who has a legal obligation created by the regulation while 
the buyers have comparatively few alternatives to mitigate the harm.
    A general principle in tax incidence is that the parties with less 
valuable alternatives bear most of the burden of costs imposed on the 
market. In the case of drug-supply-chain regulation, compliance 
obligations are created with no new money necessarily being injected 
into the system. The regulatory costs will tend to disproportionately 
fall on those with less valuable alternatives, which tends to be the 
patients and plan members. Indeed, S. 127 would impede one of the only 
alternatives--benefit management--that patients and plans have to 
mitigate the costs of manufacturers' and pharmacy-companies' market 
power.
    The point is that Dr. Trish promulgates incidence conclusions--
about who purportedly ``profits'' and who is ``harmed''--without going 
through the calculus of alternatives. What alternatives would PBMs, 
pharmacy companies, plans, patients, and manufactures have without, 
say, pharmacy price concessions? How would each of them be affected by 
the fact that the other market participants are pursuing their next-
best alternatives? Until these are considered--typically with a model 
of how the market as a whole works--there is no valid economic basis 
for any of her incidence conclusions.

    Question 3. In the Medicare Part D context, Dr. Trish also noted 
that PBMs deflect blame for their rebate practices by pointing out they 
pass them to health plans who may lower premiums but increase out-of-
pocket costs on consumers. Do you agree with Dr. Trish's argument? Why 
or why not?
    Answer. Dr. Trish's paragraph about rebate ``blame'' makes two 
distinct claims. One is that the ``ultimate result'' of negotiated 
rebates is to increase out-of-pocket costs. Because the ultimate result 
plays out in the marketplace, and Dr. Trish has not offered any market-
level analysis, she has no valid basis for that incorrect claim. The 
second claim, also incorrect and hardly relevant to the economics of 
rebates, is that any plan acknowledging a tradeoff between premiums and 
cost sharing is doing ``the opposite of what insurance is supposed to 
do.''
    Negotiated rebate transactions are volume discounts. Plans and PBMs 
get the full rebate--and the lowest possible net price--only if 
utilization targets are attained. The low net price by itself reduces 
plan expenses, which is savings that it can split between reducing 
premiums and reducing cost sharing for plan members. Even if all of the 
savings went to premiums, that still would reduce cost sharing 
generally because the low premiums help attract and retain members who 
would otherwise not have drug insurance or would have less generous 
coverage.
    Because they are backed by financial incentives, the utilization 
targets by themselves reduce cost sharing to the extent that low cost 
sharing is a tool the plan can use to encourage utilization. Cost 
sharing is typically used this way, even in Medicare Part D where cost 
sharing is regulated. Especially, plans' part of the rebate bargain is 
often to put the drug in a lower cost tier or to at least include the 
drug in its formulary, which prevents plan members from having to pay 
the full list price. These are actions that significantly reduce cost 
sharing, yet are not mentioned in Dr. Trish's testimony or in Schaeffer 
Center studies of rebates.
    Even if rebate transactions on a particular drug increased patient 
cost sharing for that drug, it likely reduces patient cost sharing for 
other drugs or, in an integrated plan, for non-drug medical claims. One 
reason is that many plans, each of which is covering many 
pharmaceutical products if not other medical services, are subject to 
actuarial-value regulations. A silver ACA plan, for example, is 
supposed to finance no more than 20 percent of benefits through patient 
cost sharing. If a plan's transaction with a particular provider 
resulted in greater cost sharing for a particular type of claim 
originating with that provider, then the plan would likely reduce cost 
sharing on other types of claims or from other providers in order to 
comply with the 20 percent requirement.
    A fundamental weakness in Dr. Trish's discussion of rebates is that 
it fails to mention that rebates are part of a larger incentive 
contract, let alone situated in a multiproduct sale (drug insurance) 
and situated in a larger market context.
    Regarding Dr. Trish's second claim, insurance involves a tradeoff 
between risk sharing and moral hazard, which refers to possible 
discrepancies between the patient's financial stake and influence on 
claim outcomes, as well as the challenge of attracting and retaining 
voluntary consumers. From an economic point of view, a plan designer is 
``supposed to'' understand that generous cost sharing provisions go 
together with higher premiums. There is real value from having the 
patient be a financial partner through cost sharing. Dr. Trish is 
incorrect that insurance plans are supposed to minimize cost sharing 
without regard for the other costs of doing so. In the real world, 
plans do regard those other costs; see, e.g., Einav, Finkelstein, and 
Polyakova (2018).
PBM Business Practices and ``Market Distortions''
    Dr. Trish also outlined what she called ``market distortions'' in 
the form of copay ``clawbacks,'' direct and indirect remuneration, and 
use of spreading pricing which negatively impacts pharmacies, including 
``$9.5 billion price concessions,'' which increase PBM profits and 
avoiding scrutiny.

    Question 1. Do you agree with Dr. Trish that these practices are 
``market distortions'' that should be addressed? Why or why not?
    Answer. No, they are more accurately described as pro-competitive 
practices that reduce the costs of the fundamental market distortions 
in pharmaceutical markets, namely market power of pharmacy companies 
and, especially, of drug manufacturers. (Their market power itself 
relates to other fundamental economic factors, such as the high cost of 
drug development and the difficulty of securing intellectual property 
rights). To label pro-competitive responses as ``market distortions'' 
without connecting them to the root cause is to, metaphorically, 
confuse the treatment with the disease itself. It is also unclear what 
is the basis for Dr. Trish's labeling any practice as a ``market 
distortion'' when she has offered no economic model of how the market 
as a whole works.
    Putting the labels aside, pharmacy price concessions are 
voluntarily given by pharmacy companies. The pharmacy company giving 
the concession gets something in return, such as preferred placement in 
the plan network and, ultimately, more traffic in its retail stores 
than would occur without making the concessions. As retailers are well 
aware, traffic in the stores can be particularly valuable when it 
drives sales of other products and services.
    While a pharmacy company benefits from its own voluntary price 
concessions, it is harmed (lower profits) by its competitors' price 
concessions. The net result of these two effects is less profits for 
pharmacy companies overall and a greater volume of retail pharmacy 
services. This is a classic example of how market competition benefits 
consumers while it increases the economic pie.
    Using regulation to curtail pharmacy price concessions would be 
anti-competitive. It would redistribute from consumers to pharmacy 
companies, while reducing the volume of retail pharmacy services. I 
estimate for each $1 that such regulation would increase pharmacy 
profits, costs of more than $6 would be imposed on patients, plans, 
manufacturers, and ultimately taxpayers (page 6 of my testimony). 
Whether giving up $6 to deliver $1 to pharmacy companies is a worthy 
policy goal is partly a value judgment for elected officials to decide.
    Just as no disease treatment is free, benefit management-activities 
that alleviate the costs of the market's fundamental distortions have 
costs themselves. It takes personnel, capital, and information-
infrastructure to manage benefits or to run just about any other type 
of buyers' club. On average, these costs are far less than the benefits 
to patients and plans and to the entire economy. At the same time, 
management costs--both those incurred by PBMs and the benefit-
management restrictions experienced by patients--are likely high at the 
margin, because this is what limits the scope of a PBM or any buyers' 
club. These are all reasons why my quantitative economic model of 
benefit management not only acknowledges various market frictions and 
imperfections including market power, coordination costs, tax 
distortions, and incomplete innovation incentives but makes them 
central to the analysis.
    Estimating or even signing the effect of pharmacy contracts on PBM 
profits requires a market-level analysis, which Dr. Trish has not 
offered. I conclude that PBM profits especially depend on entry 
barriers into the business of benefit management, which S. 127 would 
increase. That is, S. 127 would make benefit management more expensive 
for patients and plans, and potentially increase the profits of the 
largest PBMs, because regulation generally places a disproportionate 
burden on the smaller of the regulated businesses and S. 127 
particularly puts more burden on the PBMs that are not vertically 
integrated with plans and pharmacies.
PBM Transparency Act Disclosure Requirements
    You made it clear in your testimony of the unintended consequences 
associated with the disclosure requirements in S. 127. Transparency 
requirements are often good for consumers.

    Question 1. What transparency requirements could Congress consider 
in this context to avoid the consequences you outline but also fuel 
greater competition in the prescription drug market?
    Answer. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade 
Commission (1996) have concluded that disclosure requirements in 
healthcare are more beneficial, or less harmful, when the data are more 
aggregated and delayed in order to avoid disclosing proprietary 
information. In addition, Congress should consider what is happening 
with real-world PBMs for whom ``transparency'' is their business model. 
Does their lack of success suggest significant costs of that approach 
that are not commensurate with the expected benefits?
    Ultimately competition comes from real-world competitors, or at 
least from sellers who fear that high prices will increase the number 
competing. A transparent monopolist is still a monopolist. In this 
vein, Congress could consider the effect of disclosure requirements on 
entry and exit by drug manufacturers, PBMs, and pharmacy companies. 
Regulation that favors large incumbents over small new entrants reduces 
competition even if the regulation is mandating transparency.
    In the Trump Administration, we saw firsthand that deregulation, 
rather than regulation, resulted in lower drug prices because it 
brought more producers and more products into the industry. By May 9, 
2017, Scott Gottlieb was nominated and confirmed to head the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA). He immediately told Congress that his FDA 
would prioritize competition (U.S. House of Representatives, Committee 
on Appropriations, Agriculture Subcommittee 2017). He delivered, with 
approvals at a higher rate during his tenure as compared with either 
the 2 years before it or the 2 years after it. Before Gottlieb's 
leadership, the FDA averaged 54 generic approvals per month (1,286 for 
the 24 months). The average was 73 per month during Gottlieb's tenure 
(through April 2019) and 61 in the subsequent 24 months. FDA approvals 
of new drugs, new biologics, and new biosimilars were also high during 
his tenure (Mulligan 2023).
    Drug market performance reflected the additional competition 
stemming from deregulation. Incumbent manufacturers saw their stock 
prices drop in 2017 as traders realized that their regulatory 
protection was over. Even without an inflation adjustment, retail 
prescription drug prices fell in 2018 for the first time in 46 years 
after a long string of increasing faster than inflation.
    The Biden Administration is bringing costly regulations, and 
ultimately higher drug prices, back again. Early in its tenure, it 
reinstated the FDA's Unapproved Drug Initiative (86 FR 28605) under 
which FDA used its enforcement power to grant selected generic drug 
manufacturers monopolies on decades-old drugs merely because the 
manufacturer executed FDA paperwork. President Trump had ended this 
practice (85 FR 75331) because, unsurprisingly, it was sharply 
increasing the prices of generic drugs as soon as competitors were 
removed by FDA order.
Copay Clawback and Price Controls
    During the hearing, you stated that prohibitions of copay clawbacks 
would amount to price controls.
    Question 1. Please explain your reasoning for comparing a copay 
clawback prohibition to a price control.
    Answer. At the hearing, Senator Welch asked the witnesses about the 
clawback of pharmacy fees (DIR) months after the drugs are dispensed 
according to how the pharmacy met various performance metrics specified 
in their contracts with plans and PBMs. During the hearing, I pointed 
out that prohibiting those fees would be a price control. Such a 
prohibition is a price control because it prohibits contracts that pay 
pharmacies on the basis of performance metrics that would be unknown 
until months after the drugs are dispensed. Under the prohibition, a 
pharmacy that performed poorly on such metrics would have to be paid 
the same as a pharmacy that performed well.
    A copay clawback is different from pharmacy DIR clawback. A copay 
clawback refers to the practice of using some of the patient funds paid 
at the pharmacy to finance part of the insurance and benefit-management 
overhead other than the cost of acquiring the drug. Prohibiting copay 
clawbacks would be a price control because it would cap prices charged 
patients below the pharmacy drug-acquisition costs without regard for 
any of the other costs of having insurance and benefit-management 
services. Those costs would have to be paid through premiums or some 
other revenue source.
    With many price controls, their advocates recommend them on the 
basis of purported ``fairness'' even though their unintended 
consequences would often be understood as unfortunate, wasteful and 
unfair. This is why the Executive Branch requires, at least in 
principle, a ``particularly demanding burden of proof'' of a price-
control benefit that justifies the regulatory cost (Office of 
Management and Budget 2003).
PBM Rebate Pass Through
    During her response to a question posed by Sen. Rosen, Dr. Trish 
argued that rebates are not being passed on to consumers.

    Question 1. Do you agree with Dr. Trish's argument? Why or Why not?
    Answer. At the hearing, both Senator Rosen and Dr. Trish were clear 
that they understood ``passed on to consumers'' narrowly in terms of 
the amount paid ``at the pharmacy counter'' (a.k.a., ``out of pocket'' 
or ``cost sharing''). They ignored any savings that consumers get 
through lower premiums. This is a major omission because CBO, OACT, and 
I, among others, find that rebates help keep drug-plan premiums low by 
providing a revenue source beyond premiums and cost sharing.
    My disagreement with Dr. Trish is not just about her narrow 
definition of ``consumers.'' Because she does not discuss rebates as 
part of a larger incentive contract and situated in a multiproduct sale 
(drug insurance), she cannot acknowledge the ways that rebates 
substantially reduce the amount paid at the pharmacy counter.
    Real-world rebates are tied to sales targets for the manufacturer 
paying the rebate. Because they are backed by financial incentives, the 
utilization targets by themselves reduce cost sharing. Especially, 
plans' part of the rebate bargain is often to put the drug in a lower 
cost tier or to at least include the drug in its formulary, which 
prevents plan members from having to pay the full list price. These are 
actions that significantly reduce cost sharing, yet are not mentioned 
in Dr. Trish's testimony or in Schaeffer Center studies of rebates.
    Even if rebate transactions on a particular drug increased patient 
cost sharing for that drug, it likely reduces patient cost sharing for 
other drugs or, in an integrated plan, for non-drug medical claims. One 
reason is that many plans, each of which is covering many 
pharmaceutical products if not other medical services, are subject to 
actuarial-value regulations. A silver ACA plan, for example, is 
supposed to finance no more than 20 percent of benefits through patient 
cost sharing. If a plan's transaction with a particular provider 
resulted in greater cost sharing for a particular type of claims 
originating with that provider, then the plan would likely reduce cost 
sharing on other types of claims or from other providers in order to 
comply with the 20 percent requirement.

    Question 2. S. 127 contemplates a 100 percent pass through of a 
rebate to the consumer. Would consumers benefit and pay a lower price 
from this requirement? Why or Why not?
    Answer. Between drug-plan premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, 
consumers would likely pay more as a result of S. 127's Sec. 2(b)(1) 
that requires ``pass[ing] along or return[ing] 100 percent of any price 
concession to a health plan or payer. . ..''
    Sec. 2(b)(1) apparently allows plans to retain rebates for either 
reducing premiums or financing other expenses. Whether the consumer, 
more broadly than ``at the counter,'' benefits depends on what happens 
to the other expenses. S. 127's Sec. 2(b)(1) would take away a revenue 
source for PBMs without encouraging any new companies to get into the 
PBM business. Without more genuine competition among PBMs, that leaves 
only three possibilities. One is that PBMs opt to comply with Sec 2(a) 
rather than 2(b), which is their option, thereby increasing retail 
pharmacy expenses for patients and plans. A second possibility is that 
PBMs would collect their fees in another way that proves more costly to 
patients and plans. The third possibility is that PBMs do less benefit 
management, which means that plans pay more for drugs and retail 
pharmacy services.
                                 ______
                                 
      Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ted Budd to 
                         Dr. Casey B. Mulligan
    Question 1. Dr. Mulligan, could you explain why you think adding 
rebate data to the analysis of rising drug costs would be tapping into 
propriety information?
    Answer. One of the major intended (and procompetitive) results of a 
managed insurance benefit is to maintain different prices of products 
produced by monopolistic or oligopolistic healthcare providers. Because 
the systems for doing so are intellectual property that is rarely 
protected by patent or copyright, disclosure of proprietary information 
about those systems would remove much of the financial incentive to 
invest in advancing them because competitors could use the disclosed 
information to more rapidly imitate. Unlike other areas of healthcare 
where the product is a chemical, procedure, or device, much of the 
product of benefit management is the pricing and other contract 
provisions.

    Question 2. Dr. Mulligan, the Federal Trade Commission is currently 
conducting a study to ``scrutinize the impact of vertically integrated 
pharmacy benefit managers on the access and affordability of 
prescription drugs.'' \1\ There are three major Pharmacy Benefit 
Managers that control 80 percent of the market. This appears to be 
market consolidation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Can you explain why you think this helps lower prescription drug 
costs?
    Answer. Pharmacy benefit management, as compared to no (or less) 
pharmacy benefit management, reduces drug costs. This is the conclusion 
I presented at the hearing.
    A consolidated market for benefit management, as compared to 
vigorous competition in benefit management, increases drug costs both 
by increasing the price of benefit management and by reducing the 
amount of benefit management. The question of consolidated benefit 
management, which is the question you are asking now, was addressed in 
the Restrict the Middleman? report I submitted into the record on the 
day of the hearing. There I conclude that less benefit management 
competition means higher drug prices. See especially Table 5.
    [Perhaps your question is asking about the drug-cost effect of the 
forthcoming FTC study rather than the drug-cost effect of PBM 
consolidation. Without seeing the study or knowing how it is received 
in Washington, I cannot assess the drug-cost effect of that study.]

    Question 3. Dr Mulligan, in your testimony you mentioned that 
requiring disclosures of product benefit management pricing could 
remove financial incentives to negotiate lower prices and lead to firms 
imitating one another.
    Can you explain why mandating pricing disclosures could potentially 
reduce competition and undercut the effectiveness of selective pricing 
by health plans?
    Answer. One of the major intended (and procompetitive) results of a 
managed insurance benefit is to maintain different prices of products 
produced by monopolistic or oligopolistic healthcare providers. Because 
the systems for doing so are intellectual property that is rarely 
protected by patent or copyright, disclosure of proprietary information 
about those systems would remove much of the financial incentive to 
invest in advancing them because competitors could use the disclosed 
information to more rapidly imitate. Unlike other areas of healthcare 
where the product is a chemical, procedure, or device, much of the 
product of benefit management is the pricing and other contract 
provisions.
    Consider an example in the spirit of U.S. Department of Justice and 
the Federal Trade Commission (1996). Three branded drug therapies 
compete. Absent mandated disclosures, one pays a 20 percent rebate, a 
second pays 30 percent, and a third pays 40 percent. The second and 
third understand that they are rebating more than another competitor 
but are unaware that the gap from the more expensive competitor is a 
full 10 percentage points. As full disclosure reveals the gaps, the 
second reduces its rebate to 21 percent while the third reduces to 22 
percent. In other words, full disclosure reduces the average rebate 
from 30 percent to 21 percent.
