 STATEMENT OF HON. PETER WELCH, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF 
                            VERMONT

    Senator Welch. Good morning. I call the hearing of the U.S. 
Senate Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy to order. 
Today we are holding our Subcommittee's first hearing, and it 
is on the topic of rural broadband, that Senator Tuberville and 
I thought was of vital importance.
    I would like to thank Chair Stabenow and Ranking Member 
Boozman, the Subcommittee Ranking Member, Senator Tuberville 
for their support in convening this hearing, and I really want 
to thank all our witnesses for making the trip here and sharing 
your experience and knowledge. You are on the forefront of 
getting broadband deployed.
    Our overall job is to revitalize rural America, and the 
health of rural America. Our rural communities embrace strong 
values, they care about where they live, they care about the 
people they live with. They are the highest rate of enrollment 
in our military. We are proud of the values of rural America.
    It is under stress from its agricultural economy, and it 
has lost a lot of its manufacturing base, and our goal is to do 
all we can to help revive that.
    One of the big challenges in rural America is access to 
high-quality, high-speed broadband. It is absolutely essential. 
In pre-COVID, a lot of us had a debate with our urban 
colleagues. Post-COVID it is obvious that you cannot be in the 
21st century without high-speed internet any more than you can 
be in rural America without electricity. One-third of rural 
Americans are unable to access broadband of 100 Mbps, and you 
have got to have speed. That is just above average speed for 
most internet users. When our communities lack access to 
quality internet, they are locked out of the global economy and 
cutoff from critical services, and we want to change that. 
Workers have fewer opportunities, farmers and small businesses 
are isolated from new markets, and our kids are really limited 
in their educational opportunities.
    We need a rural broadband that will do three things. One, 
it will have the high speeds, 100 Mbps. It has to be future-
proofed in the buildout so that five or ten years from now, one 
or two farm bills later, we are not in the same position, 
lagging behind urban America. Anything short of that and we 
will be back here doing this all over again.
    Second, we have got to make Federal broadband efforts more 
effective and efficient. It is one thing to get the money; it 
is another thing to spend it wisely, and make it effective, and 
get that broadband service to the last farm on the dirt road in 
your small town.
    Finally, USDA needs the tools and flexibilities to address 
the long-term, scalable broadband needs of underserved rural 
communities, and all of our communities are somewhat different. 
That is what makes the challenge so great. Even in Vermont, 
which we will hear about, we have got places where there are 
lots of mountains. We have got places where it is kind of flat.
    Today along with Senator Marshall, I introduced the 
Reconnecting Rural America Act. That bill, No. 1, would 
establish 100 Mbps symmetrical buildout speeds; No. 2, set 
unserved definitions to ensure the program is reaching those 
who need broadband the most and not building where it is not 
needed; next, expand USDA's authority to coordinate with other 
Federal agencies; and finally, provide sufficient authorization 
levels to address the overwhelming demand that the program 
currently experiences.
    Now the Northeast Kingdom--and this is on the top of 
effective implementation--is a small section, beautiful 
section, proud section of Vermont, and it serves many 
underserved homes. Today, the Northeast Kingdom broadband, 
represented by one of our witnesses, I am happy to announce, 
received an award of $17.5 million from USDA's ReConnect 
program to address the broadband needs of this region in 
Vermont. The money is going to go a long way toward helping us 
in the kingdom.
    We have confidence that the NEK, Northeast Kingdom, 
Broadband will get it done right. That is because they are 
based in their community. Vermont has established Community 
Union Districts that are voluntary associations of towns. It is 
not based in Wall Street, where hedge funds smell the money and 
come in, walk away, and do not get the job done.
    We have got a lot to do and a lot to hear from. We can do 
this. You know, rural electrification--that was 100 years ago--
it took about 15 years, and that was a social commitment, not a 
business decision. It was based on a recognition by Congress of 
the importance of rural America. We have got to do that again.
    I really want to thank all the witnesses who are here, and 
I am now going to turn to my counterpart, my colleague in this 
effort, and I have really enjoyed working with you and your 
staff, you have been terrific, Senator Tuberville.

STATEMENT OF HON. TOMMY TUBERVILLE, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE 
                           OF ALABAMA

    Senator Tuberville. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward 
to working with you. I think we can get a lot done. A special 
thanks to all the witnesses here today, especially Mr. Fred 
Johnson, who I have known for a while. Thank you for coming all 
the way from Alabama.
    You know, I look forward to our discussion, and as we all 
know, this is not just for Alabama but for all over the 
country. Rural broadband is important. We have had the internet 
for years, and we are struggling in that area. In today's day 
and age, access to reliable internet service is not a want--it 
is a need. It is vital. Rural communities cannot compete, much 
less survive, with urban areas unless they have broadband 
internet.
    If the pandemic taught us anything, it is that Americans 
need reliable and fast internet to work, take online classes, 
and complete homework, have virtual meetings through Zoom, and 
participate in telemedicine. Additionally, our farmers rely on 
internet access to operate their equipment and operations. The 
technology of farming is constantly changing, and our producers 
need resources to remain competitive. Modern farming utilizes 
precision agriculture technologies, tractors and combines with 
GPS systems and irrigation equipment that can be managed 
remotely from smartphones and tablets. Without internet access, 
our farmers cannot farm, and our rural communities will get 
left behind.
    In Alabama, 55 out of the 67 counties are considered rural. 
Out of the State's population, 43.6 percent live in rural 
areas.
    Rural development programs aim to prioritize investment in 
the most rural and unserved areas across the country, which are 
often economically depressed. In Alabama, this region is called 
the Black Belt, which consists of 19 counties in the western 
part of the State. The Black Belt is the home to nine out of 
ten most economically challenged counties in the State. These 
areas are in critical need of support and development.
    A vital step in developing our rural communities is 
ensuring access to reliable broadband service, and that is why 
I am here today to advocate not only just for Alabama but for 
the entire country. We need to work on this farm bill for rural 
internet. Two key considerations that need to be kept top of 
mind throughout our discussion of broadband in the farm bill: 
prioritizing unserved areas and considering feasible buildout 
speeds to provide reliable service.
    In their latest funding proposal, the USDA increased 
requirements for sufficient broadband access from speeds of 25/
3 Mbps to 100/20 Mbps, download and upload speeds. Yet, about 
10 percent of Alabamians do not have access to download and 
upload speeds of 25/3. Furthermore, only 34 percent of my State 
has access to fiberoptic service, which can supply 100/100 
symmetrical speeds. How are we supposed to close the digital 
divide if we are leaving our rural communities in the dust?
    This Subcommittee cannot focus solely on providing fast 
speeds when we continue to have areas with no service at all. 
These service gaps are what we should consider when allocating 
resources. We, as a Subcommittee, should consider all 
technology options to deliver broadband to our rural 
communities. While fiber deployment has been hugely successful 
in Alabama, other States may have positive experiences with 
other types of deployment, given various terrains and local 
needs. Regardless, we should advocate for deployment of at 
least 100/20 speeds across the country.
    Turning our attention to the unserved areas is the best way 
to develop rural communities. We must prioritize broadband 
deployment to unserved and underserved areas. With this game 
plan we ensure efficient use of taxpayer resources and do not 
leave communities behind.
    I look forward to working with my colleagues to craft 
effective broadband policy that benefits all Americans.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Welch. Thank you, Senator Tuberville, and without 
objection I will introduce into the records two letters, one 
from Rural Development and another from a group of interested 
parties on broadband.

    [The letters can be found on pages 80-85 in the appendix.]

    Senator Welch. Now I would like to introduce the witnesses, 
and I will be quick because we want to hear from them, more 
than about them.
    Roger Nishi is the Vice President for Industry Relations at 
Waitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom in Vermont. He 
currently serves on the board of directors for the Technology 
Association of New England and Telecom Insurance Group. He has 
36 years of experience. Thank you, Roger, for being here.
    Christa Shute is the Executive Director of NEK Broadband in 
St. Johnsbury, Vermont. She has been a leader in broadband 
since 2009. She has 20 years of management experience. Her 
organization, NEK Broadband, serves one of the most rural parts 
of our State, and she recently secured the State's first-ever 
ReConnect award, as in today. Christa and her team will make 
excellent use of this funding. Congratulations.
    Senator Durbin is not here. He wanted to introduce Mr. 
Shekleton, but he is unsparing in his praise for the work you 
have done. Mr. Shekleton is the Director of Broadband 
Operations at Jo-Carroll Energy. That is a rural electric, 
natural gas, and broadband facility in Elizabeth, Illinois.
    Senator Tuberville, would you like to introduce Mr. Johnson 
and Mr. Forde?
    Senator Tuberville. Yes, I will. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I am proud to introduce Mr. Fred Johnson of Rainsville, 
Alabama. Fred has served as the President and CEO of Farmers 
Telecommunications Cooperative in Rainsville since 2002. Fred 
is renowned throughout north Alabama for his work to bridge the 
digital divide and put Alabama on the map. His company, Farmers 
Telecommunications Cooperative, or FTC, is the State's largest 
member-owned provider of telecommunications services. FTC was 
also the first Alabama company to deploy a widely adopted 
gigabit internet access service that now delivers multi-gig 
speeds throughout their service area.
    Fred's career spans 41 years in the fields of rural 
communications, telecommunications, rural electrification, and 
public accounting. He is a member and current Vice President of 
the board of directors of Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative. 
Previously he served on the board and as the Chairman of The 
Rural Broadband Association.
    He received his undergraduate degree from Southern Wesleyan 
University and his graduate degree from the University of 
Tennessee, which we will not hold against him, Chattanooga. He 
is currently pursuing a doctorate in business administration 
from Southern. I am grateful for the hard work he has done so 
far in deploying broadband in Alabama.
    Mr. Forde, thank you for being here. Next, I am proud to 
introduce Mr. Forde as a guy from North Dakota. They have got a 
pretty good football team. Special thanks to Senator Thune and 
his office for facilitating the connection to have Justin with 
us today.
    Justin is the Vice President of Government Relations for 
Midcontinent Communication, or Midco, and has worked for the 
company since 2014. Midco is the leading provider of reliable 
high-speed internet via fiber and fixed wireless technology 
across the West and Midwest. Before joining Midco, Justin 
served on my colleague, Senator John Hoeven's staff, so he is 
very familiar with Senate hearings and the Ag Committee.
    Justin has served on the board of several organizations, 
nonprofits, including Greater North Dakota Chapter of Minnesota 
Cable Communications, and so on. He earned his bachelor's 
degree from Northern State University and master's from Florida 
State. Glad you're here.
    Senator Welch. Thank you.
    Roger Nishi, you are recognized for five minutes.

 STATEMENT OF ROGER NISHI, VICE PRESIDENT, INDUSTRY RELATIONS, 
    WAITSFIELD AND CHAMPLAIN VALLEY TELECOM, WAITSFIELD, VT

    Mr. Nishi. Good afternoon, Senator Welch, Ranking Member 
Tuberville, and members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for 
holding this hearing and asking me to testify today. My name is 
Roger Nishi, and I am the Vice President of Industry Relations 
at Waitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom in Vermont.
    WCVT is a 119-year-old, family owned, third-generation, 
community-based rural broadband provider serving the Mad River 
Valley and Champlain Valley regions of Vermont. WCVT strongly 
believes in the USDA programs. We have had a relationship with 
USDA and RUS and the predecessor, REA, for many years. In the 
early 1960's, the Haskin family literally ``bet the farm,'' and 
when no one else would give them a loan locally, signed a 25-
year loan with REA for $400,000 to install new direct-dial 
telephone equipment. Seven years later, they went back to REA 
and secured $640,000 to bring single-party service to all of 
their customers, the first in Vermont to do so.
    Jump forward to 2010. WCVT was the recipient and awarded 
$5.6 million from the RUS Broadband Initiative Program to bring 
fiber to approximately 740 locations within the company's 
service area, to areas where DSL just did not make sense.
    Over the years our network has evolved, from cord board 
operators to the computer digital switches of today, with 
internet from dial-up to the various flavors of DSL, and now 
our main focus is on fiber. Each progression has brought better 
service or greater speeds to our customers.
    As we continue to evolve our networks and connecting our 
communities, there are several ways that USDA can help move our 
rural networks forward.
    No. 1, future-proof the networks in rural America by 
building fiber. This can be accomplished by keeping the minimum 
speed for eligible projects administered by USDA to receive 
funds at the 100/100 level. 100/100 means fiber. We have been 
saying fiber is our future at WCVT for many, many years, and 
the same needs to be said of all rural areas. Other 
technologies have limitations, do not have the future capacity 
of fiber, and cannot keep pace with the ever-expanding demands 
of our customers. Investing in fiber is the best money spent 
and the most effective use of Federal funding.
    No. 2, experience matters, and track records of success 
should be taken into consideration. We believe that USDA 
programs should prioritize funding with those serving rural 
areas and those that have shown that they can do the job, and 
also those that worked with USDA in the past with loans. They 
should work with them also. One thing that I would like to note 
is any grant application scoring should not penalize commercial 
companies.
    No. 3, we need to limit overbuilds by having all of the 
organizations work together to ensure that there are not 
overbuilds and there is not duplicative funding. That is just 
an inefficient use of Federal funding when we do so. A key to 
this is accurate maps, and those accurate maps will help make 
sure that we do serve those that are unserved today.
    Further, we need to limit project delays due to permitting. 
Too many times today jobs are slowed down because of the 
permitting process. We need to make sure that there are time 
limits put on approvals and also adequate staffing to do to the 
reviews.
    While the USDA programs help build networks and support 
community development, I do need to mention other programs that 
are not part of your jurisdiction but work hand-in-hand with 
the grants and loans programs.
    Universal service funds, which help ensure sustainable 
networks. The FCC's A-CAM and CAF-BLS universal server programs 
complement loan and grant funding. The funding contributes to 
construction budgets, helps maintain, sustain, and upgrade 
networks to help keep rates reasonably affordable for all 
customers. Such funding helps make everyone's business case for 
many rural companies. I encourage you all to call the FCC and 
urge them to take immediate action on extending A-CAM and CAF-
BLS companies.
    The next item, do not tax grants. Pass S. 341. Thank you 
for co-sponsoring that, Senator. Right now if Waitsfield 
receives grants, approximately 21 percent will go to pay taxes. 
It is really discouraging knowing that that money could be 
going to build broadband to more rural customers.
    Finally, I am running out of time so I will be really 
quick, the Affordable Connectivity Program. We do need to make 
sure that this is sustained and funded, and over time, increase 
that $30 amount that goes to consumers because $30 does not 
make broadband always affordable.
    Thank you for hearing from me today, and I appreciate the 
time. Thank you.

32 in the appendix.]

    Senator Welch. Thank you very much.
    Christa Shute.

STATEMENT OF CHRISTA SHUTE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NEK (NORTHEAST 
             KINGDOM) BROADBAND, ST. JOHNSBURY, VT

    Ms. Shute. Thanks very much. Chair Welch and Ranking Member 
Tuberville and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the 
opportunity. As the Executive Director of NEK Broadband I am 
here to share my experiences with the USDA development programs 
and why I believe the continuation of ReConnect is so critical 
to the economic vitality of rural America, and some of my top 
concerns and recommendations for your consideration.
    We are one of ten communications union districts in 
Vermont. We are formed of 56 towns in the northeast portion of 
the State. It is an exceptionally beautiful but rugged and 
rural area. We applied and received, as was announced just now, 
the ReConnect award. That $17.5 million is part of a $23.5 
million project. It will bring 321 miles of infrastructure 
across 22 of our most rural and underserved towns, to serve 
3,300 people, 94 businesses, 183 farms, and 11 educational 
facilities. A huge thank-you to the work of the USDA staff as 
they have been helpful and responsive.
    We all know the importance of broadband and how critical it 
is to our rural communities. I will just share a couple of real 
experiences.
    Teachers have remarked on the dramatic and heart-breaking 
difference between those that were able to continue learning 
and those that were not due to the lack of broadband access, 
and this continues as we move more and more to digital 
learning.
    The other key for most of our rural areas are the vast 
distances that they must travel for health care. This week, 
Blue Cross Blue Shield stopped reimbursing for telephone 
visits, which means we must develop access to broadband and 
create affordability for everyone, in part, through continued 
authorization of the Affordable Connectivity Program, because 
the need extends beyond the pandemic.
    ReConnect is necessary because the BEAD program simply will 
not be enough to achieve universal service. Like many other 
programs, BEAD focuses on the lower costs per address for a 
competitive grant for the lower costs per address, and as a 
result it is going to favor the more populated rural areas. It 
is going to go to rural America, but it is going to go to the 
more populated areas. This is going to exacerbate the issue in 
the most rural of rural America.
    The competition for ReConnect funds, on the other hand, is 
based on characteristics that support our most rural 
communities and addresses the true cost to get to some of these 
sparsely populated areas. I applaud the Appropriations Act 
providing $365 million for Round 5 of ReConnect, but it 
undermines two key characteristics of the ReConnect program and 
makes it virtually unusable for all of Vermont and a lot of 
other areas that have spotty coverage through wireless.
    First, those eligible areas in ReConnect 3 and 4 were based 
on 120 Mbps service, and the act requires that 90 percent of 
the area have 25/3 service. This will disqualify Vermont and 
other areas with fixed wireless.
    Second, ReConnect 3 and 4 focused on long-term 
infrastructure investment. The USDA understood that we needed 
to make long-term investments so that we did not need to make 
them again, and that means building a standard of 100 Mbps 
symmetrical by building with fiber.
    My top recommendations for the existing ReConnect program 
include the definition of rurality, the importance of public 
infrastructure, and the application process. Currently, 
ReConnect heavily favors some parts of the country over others, 
primarily the two pieces are the 100 miles from a city or town 
with a population of 50,000, which is most of the Eastern 
Seaboard does not qualify, and with less than six people per 
square mile.
    The reality is that rurality is not a straight line. ``You 
can't get there from here'' is a common New England expression 
because it can be complicated to get from one point to another, 
due to topography, terrain, and weather. Similar challenges 
exist throughout the Appalachian Range and the Rockies. 
Consider providing rurality points based on population per 
town, for example, with towns with less than 5,000 people.
    For public infrastructure, that is currently a point 
structure under ReConnect, and it is an important one. When we 
invest in public infrastructure, we are reinvesting our dollars 
over and over again. We believe in public-private partnerships 
like we have with Waitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom, 
where the municipal owns the underlying infrastructure and 
leverages the expertise of a private company. We can protect 
our grant dollars and create public accountability by ensuring 
that municipalities have access to these funds.
    I do have top recommendations around the application 
process, particularly that I would love to share with you, and 
I can do that in the question section, perhaps.
    I would like to conclude by saying that broadband is 
fundamentally an equity issue. Rural areas, and particularly 
low-income residents need access to broadband for the basic of 
education and telehealth. I support the ReConnecting Rural 
America Act, with the modifications that I noted in my 
testimony.
    Thanks very much.

     STATEMENT OF JESSE L. SHEKLETON, DIRECTOR, BROADBAND 
       OPERATIONS, JO-CARROLL ENERGY, INC., ELIZABETH, IL

    Mr. Shekleton. Chairman Welch, Ranking Member Tuberville, 
and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to 
testify today. My name is Jesse Shekleton, and I serve as 
Director of Broadband Operations for Jo-Carroll Energy, a rural 
energy and broadband cooperative headquartered in Elizabeth, 
Illinois.
    Jo-Carroll Energy formed in 1939, leveraging a USDA loan to 
help close what then would have been the electric divide. Since 
then, Jo-Carroll Energy has grown to provide reliable and 
affordable electric and natural gas services to a combined 
total of more than 26,000 families, farms, and small businesses 
in northwest Illinois.
    Jo-Carroll also provides vital broadband service to nearly 
4,000 members, and growing fast. USDA's ReConnect and Community 
Connect programs have been key contributors to this buildout in 
rural northwest Illinois.
    As a not-for-profit, member-owned cooperative, Jo-Carroll 
Energy is locally controlled and strives to keep its services 
safe, affordable, and reliable. In 2008, we began offering 
fixed wireless broadband services to our members, but due to 
issues with reliability, capacity, and intermittency we have 
now pivoted to building a fiber-only network. We have 
determined that fiber is the most effective and economic 
technology to provide robust broadband to our rural 
communities. Fiber allows us to ensure that the investments we 
make in this network today will be able to meet existing and 
future utility needs as well as improve the economic outlook at 
and quality of life in the rural communities we serve.
    Through USDA's ReConnect and Community Connect programs, 
Jo-Carroll has been able to expand its broadband footprint to 
connecting areas of eight public school districts, three fire 
stations, and numerous farms, families, and businesses with 
fiber broadband. Fiber enables also, as a utility, to better 
manage consumer demands for electric and natural gas service 
during peak times as well as expand other smart grid offerings 
to our members.
    Improved connectivity also provides a massive benefit to 
one of the largest economic sectors in Illinois, agriculture. 
Precision agriculture has grown in recent years, with farmers 
and ranchers leveraging a wide range of connected devices to 
reduce input costs and improve yields. As precision and smart 
ag technologies expand to include autonomous tractors, soil 
sampling, or field mapping, demands for bandwidth on the farm 
will continue to grow, underscoring why a robust and scalable 
connection is essential.
    As Congress considers how to best support rural 
connectivity through the upcoming farm bill, I would like to 
offer a few suggestions.
    Congress should prioritize scalable, future-proof networks 
in any future rounds of Federal funding for broadband. Consumer 
and technology demands for increased internet speeds continue 
to grow and are trending toward a need for multi-gigabit 
service by 2030. Prioritizing symmetrical speeds and network 
technologies that are scalable will ensure that rural and 
remote areas are able to meet consumer needs, both now and into 
the future.
    Additionally, Federal programs, including those managed by 
USDA, do not move quickly, and there are long lags in 
deployment. It is often months, many months, from the time an 
award is announced to the time construction is started. 
Permitting issues, supply chain delays, challenges in finding a 
qualified work force, and inflation are commonplace and can be 
detrimental to the original feasibility of a project. 
Streamlining the permitting processes will better align project 
timelines with the consumer needs of today.
    More than 80 years ago, not-for-profit electric 
cooperatives partnered with the USDA to bring electric service 
to areas that were challenging and too costly for investor-
owned utilities to serve. Today, electric cooperatives are once 
again partnering with USDA to bring vital broadband services to 
those same areas.
    On behalf of Jo-Carroll Energy, I want to thank the Chair 
and Ranking Member for inviting me to testify today. Reliable, 
scalable internet access is critical to the growth and economic 
development of rural communities in northwest Illinois and 
across the country. Jo-Carroll and the rest of our Nation's 
electric cooperatives look forward to working with you on our 
shared goal of connecting all Americans with a robust and 
reliable internet connection.
    I am happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you.

    Senator Welch. Thank you. Thank you very much.
    Now Mr. Johnson, you are recognized for five minutes.

      STATEMENT OF JAMES FREDERICK JOHNSON, CEO, FARMERS 
      TELECOMMUNICATIONS COOPERATIVE, INC., RAINSVILLE, AL

    Mr. Johnson. Chairman Welch, Ranking Member Tuberville, 
distinguished members of the Committee, thank you for this 
opportunity.
    I am old enough to have had the unique experience of being 
challenged by a number of the wise men and women who are 
responsible for the early rural development of our area. They 
challenged me to carry on that effort. To that end, I am 
humbled and grateful to have the opportunity to speak to you 
today about this particular subject. The reason is simple: what 
you do here makes a difference in the lives of the people I 
serve and millions like them across the land.
    The unprecedented commitment of the U.S. Congress to expand 
the deployment of broadband holds great promise for the Nation, 
yet the task is substantial and there are pitfalls to be 
avoided. Important lessons drawn from the prior successes must 
not be forgotten. The farm bill affords you an opportunity to 
ensure they are not. I hope that my comments today are helpful 
in that regard.
    First and foremost, may I suggest that the U.S. Congress 
demand that broadband resources provided under the farm bill be 
used for getting broadband to those who do not have it? The 
goal is not to duplicate existing investment or to generate 
artificial competition in areas that already cannot support 
even a single, unsubsidized competitor. If scarce taxpayer 
resources are to be efficiently used, those tax dollars must go 
first to those who need it most.
    Commonly, USDA funding has required that at least 90 
percent of a proposed service area be incapable of receiving 
service equal to or greater than 100 megabits downstream and 
200 Mbps upstream. Now arguments may be made to lower this 
eligibility threshold but only in view of one important fact: 
the lower the threshold, whatever it may be, the higher the 
probability that taxpayer dollars will be used for duplicating 
networks rather than serving the unserved, and further 
imperiling the ability of existing providers to economically 
leverage their existing networks in areas where others will not 
provide service.
    By focusing more granularly on proposed funding areas, 
Alabama has a good track record in this regard. Even would-be 
competitors have rallied around a program that does not foster 
conflict among providers but, rather, enables service to the 
truly unserved. Indeed, free from imminent threats of 
government-funded competition, two of my Alabama colleagues, 
Pine Belt Telephone and Communications, and the Hayneville 
Telephone Company have just utilized a mix of USDA funding and 
private equity for what I think is, collectively, the largest 
single investment yet in broadband infrastructure in some of 
the most economically challenged areas of Alabama, in fact, two 
of the counties to which Ranking Member Tuberville referred in 
his opening comments.
    I should also note that these two colleagues are family 
owned, community-based providers with a history of supporting 
their community. The rule should not discourage the 
participation of companies like that in this program.
    Out of concern for time I will confine the balance of my 
remarks to five quick points.
    First, 100 megabits symmetrical broadband should continue 
to be USDA's minimum standard services for funding and new 
development. USDA investments should support technology that 
can be readily upgraded to deliver the fastest speeds over the 
long term. Some technologies may appear cheaper to deploy now, 
but they will be unable to keep pace with consumer demand.
    Two, Federal grants must be entirely spent for designated 
purposes and should not thereafter be subject to Federal 
taxation. That is illogical, and we appreciate the efforts at 
co-sponsoring on S. 341.
    Three, meaningful improvement in permitting, at all levels 
of government, is essential for efficient deployment.
    Fourth, we encourage you to give RUS the ability and 
flexibility to allow concurrent expenditures of grant funds and 
matching dollars. This will eliminate potential financial 
hardship, yet it will preserve the much-needed requirement that 
grant recipients be sufficiently invested in the program.
    Finally, we strongly urge coordination of Federal resources 
across all aid platforms and programs. That is absolutely 
essential. Remember that basic voice telephone connectivity, 
including access to 9-1-1, is still essential for many areas 
that do not have reliable cell service, a fact that is often 
overlooked. Support the efforts of your colleagues in this 
regard to modernize the future of the Federal Universal Service 
program. It is absolutely essential to preserving much of what 
has been done.
    Albert Einstein once said this: ``Everything should be made 
as simple as possible but never more so.'' In the frame of that 
reference, please remember that the successful deployment of 
broadband in rural America is not a singular model of identical 
blocks. It is a tapestry involving the efforts of diverse 
existing and would-be providers. I encourage you to maintain 
your focus on the customers in our country who have no or 
inadequate service. Take note of the lessons learned by 
successful providers. It will go a long way to keeping rural 
Americans fully connected to our world.
    Know that I and the people I serve appreciate your 
leadership on this issue. Thank you for your service and for 
allowing me to address you today.

    [The prepared statement of Mr. Johnson can be found on page 
58 in the appendix.]

    Senator Welch. Thank you very much.
    Now our last witness, Mr. Forde.

    STATEMENT OF JUSTIN FORDE, VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT 
                RELATIONS, MIDCO, WEST FARGO, ND

    Mr. Forde. Chair Welch, Ranking Member Tuberville, and 
members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here to 
discuss Midco's experience with Federal broadband funding 
programs. My name is Justin Forde, and I am the Vice President 
of Government Relations for Midcontinent Communications.
    Nearly 500,000 residential and business customers count on 
Midco services across five States: South Dakota, North Dakota, 
Minnesota, Kansas, and Wisconsin. The majority of the 
approximately 450 communities we serve are very rural, with 
most having populations closer to 500 than 5,000.
    The last few years have put a renewed spotlight on the 
importance of broadband connectivity for all Americans, and at 
Midco we have risen to the challenge of connecting as many of 
our friends and neighbors as possible. We have invested over 
$765 million in the last 6 years to extend and upgrade our 
network. In 2021, we launched an initiative to invest another 
$500 million to future-proof our existing network and to expand 
to new communities, and we are making great progress. Today I 
can report that 100 percent of Midco's wireline customers are 
receiving speeds that exceed 1 gig, many already receiving 5 
gig speeds for those customers.
    Our growth has included important progress in reaching 
previously unserved areas, thanks to our partnerships with the 
FCC through its CAF II and RDOF auctions, as well as our 
partnerships with the States we serve. For example, we were 
recently awarded two grants through the Minnesota Office of 
Broadband Development, totaling over $2.5 million, for 
deployments to improve connectivity in Isanti County, in lakes 
country in Minnesota, and in Forest Lake, along the St. Croix 
River. Two grants in South Dakota, one in the very tough-to-
serve Black Hills area, and one along the Missouri River, west 
of Yankton.
    We are committed to our rural communities and believe that 
they are being overlooked by many programs today. Unserved 
communities lack broadband for one reason above all others--
they are expensive to serve. Programs like ReConnect could help 
companies to incentivize to build, but recent changes to the 
program have significantly shifted the focus away from truly 
unserved areas in rural America.
    This leads to my first recommendation. The ReConnect 
program should absolutely refocus on unserved areas. While 
rural areas originally had to have 90 percent of households 
unserved to be eligible for funding, the most recent round 
reduced that threshold to a mere 50 percent of households. This 
decrease encourages overbuilding and does not make good use of 
government funds. For example, we were recently overbuilt by 
two ReConnect awards in rural South Dakota, even though we were 
building those areas funded by Connect America Fund Phase II 
FCC auction awards. What this stops is there are still other 
parts of South Dakota who still lack broadband while two 
providers are receiving funding from USDA, and one from the 
FCC, to serve the exact same areas.
    Similarly, the level of broadband service to be required 
for an area to be considered served has been raised from 25/3 
to 100/20. As a result, areas that already had robust broadband 
service are suddenly eligible as unserved. Applications for 
ReConnect have focused on these areas which are easier to serve 
and near population centers. While they get new service, other 
areas just down the road that are rural struggle to attract 
broadband deployment, and those truly rural and tough-to-serve 
areas still remain without broadband.
    Second, broadband funding programs must be technology 
neutral and encourage broad participation. Certain communities 
present topographical or other challenges that make building 
wireline a poor solution. We are still able to reach many of 
these rural communities because we edge out from our fiber 
network using fixed wireless technology. The build-to speeds 
often required to obtain funding mean we often cannot apply if 
some portion of the network needs to be fixed wireless. 
Programs need flexibility to accommodate different 
technological solutions to take care of our customers and your 
constituents.
    Third, barriers to participation need to be as low as 
possible. Even with recent improvements, the amount of data 
required for ReConnect applications is vastly excessive. Some 
of the rules, including the government having a first lien on 
assets, simply make this program unworkable for private 
capital.
    Finally, Federal and State agencies absolutely must 
coordinate to ensure a common understanding of unserved areas. 
Maps used for broadband grant funding should be consistent and 
should show all areas where funding has been awarded, whether 
that be Federal, State, or local, or even if facilities have 
not yet been constructed. Entities should not be able to 
``forum shop'' for the least restrictive program. In one case, 
we have successfully challenged a grant from a provider who 
already lost RDOF and CAP-II auctions to build under the 
ReConnect program, only to have the applicant still go for a 
fourth funding source to serve the same area and be awarded it 
under the ARPA Capital Projects Fund.
    One promising piece of legislation that would address many 
of these issues that we have identified is the Rural Internet 
Improvement Act of 2023. It would make many key improvements to 
the ReConnect program, focus funding on unserved areas, reduce 
those participation burdens, and require tighter agency 
coordination. These are key changes so that broadband actually 
reaches the folks in rural America that need it faster.
    I commend the Committee for its focus on ensuring that the 
billions of dollars spent on broadband deployment benefit all 
Americans, including those in rural America.
    Thank you again for inviting me here today, and we look 
forward to working with you on these important issues.

    [The prepared statement of Mr. Forde can be found on page 
64 in the appendix.]

    Senator Welch. Thank you very much. Thank you to all of the 
witnesses. We will begin now with five-minute rounds of 
questions for each member.
    Mr. Nishi, I want to have you talk a little bit about this 
question of the 100/100 Mbps versus a different standard. I 
have a concern about future-proofing technology changes very 
quickly. Technology neutral is one thing, but there is a 
question about having broadband that has the capacity to be 
able to benefit by any improvements in technology so we do not 
have a situation where rural America is left behind 5 or 10 
years from now. That is my point of view. We also have this 
demand where people have no service whatsoever, and a lot of 
folks might think anything is better than nothing.
    Can you talk about that, because in my ReConnecting Rural 
America Act, with Senator Marshall, we would establish 
symmetrical speeds of 100/100 Mbps.
    Mr. Nishi. Thank you, Senator, for that question. 100/100 
and fiber networks, it is time to get the base built out in the 
rural areas, and the base is getting fiber to each and every 
location within the areas we serve. Over time, we will be able 
to update the electronics on the fiber to bring multiple 
gigabit speeds to our customers in future years. No other 
technology right now has the future that we can provide over 
the fiber.
    Now is the time to focus on fiber and get fiber everywhere, 
as soon as possible, as it will be the most efficient use of 
the Federal funding dollars that are available.
    Senator Welch. Thank you. Ms. Shute, can you explain the 
Community Union District concept in Vermont, and whether you 
think entities like that should be eligible for ReConnect 
grants?
    Ms. Shute. Certainly. A Communications Union District is a 
municipality. It has been formed by multiple municipalities 
that join together to provide communications services to the 
area. Our focus is on the unserved, primarily those with less 
than 25/3 Mbps wired service, and that effectively means that 
anybody less than cable.
    The Communication Union District also provides the 
opportunity for a public infrastructure point, and it is 
important that we have the opportunity to build the 
infrastructure and operate in these communities where it is not 
been feasible for private companies to do so.
    Senator Welch. Thank you. Mr. Shekleton, I appreciate your 
testimony about coordination, it is really important. Based on 
your experience, how would the ReConnect program benefit from 
USDA having more flexibility with coordination with other 
Federal agencies? Also, do you support the inclusion of other 
provision in the ReConnecting Rural America Act in the farm 
bill, such as the 100/100 Mbps speed requirement, increased 
authorization levels, and coordination?
    Mr. Shekleton. Yes, thank you for the question, Senator. 
The benefit of the USDA having greater flexibility coordinating 
with other Federal agencies, I think the benefit there is 
USDA's rich history in its commitment to rural America. I think 
in coordination with the other agencies, USDA could actually 
stand out to be a leader in those coordination efforts.
    The USDA has been providing the Telcom industry with loans 
and grants for decades. They have a long history of experience 
in this arena. I think there is a great benefit there, 
including some of the streamlined permitting opportunities that 
USDA could bring to the table and help lead a more effective 
and efficient process.
    Senator Welch. Thank you. The streamlined permitting seems 
to be a common concern that every one of you has. Is that 
correct? Also, the taxation of grants to bleed away what you 
could be spending on broadband deployment is a real problem as 
well, as all of the witnesses shared. Thank you.
    My time is just about up, so I am going to yield to the 
Ranking Member, Senator Tuberville.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You are going 
to see people moving in and out because we have a vote going on 
as we speak. Again, thanks for all of you being here.
    Let's talk about service speeds real quick, Mr. Forde and 
Mr. Johnson. For instance, my State, in Alabama, there are 
190,000 people that are considered underserved, and we have 
service speeds that are 25/3 Mbps. According to the USDA 
definition, an unserved area is considered one with available 
speeds of 100/20, when before it was 25/3.
    Given this change, how can we ensure areas with 25/3, or 
even less, are going to have service? Mr. Johnson and Mr. 
Forde.
    Mr. Johnson. Senator, in the State of Alabama we are now 
focusing on a threshold of 100/20, but you are absolutely 
correct. There are many people that do not have access to 
service of 25/3.
    If we look at the best available data today, a family of 
four is already demanding bandwidth in excess of 100 meg 
symmetrical service, if you look at some of the best data that 
is available today.
    In light of that, we are way past arguing that 25/3 is an 
acceptable service standard for any level of service. It gets a 
little more dicey when we come up to the next step. Now 100/20 
is the threshold for eligibility, but in the State of Alabama 
there is great preference shown to the expenditure grant funds 
for projects that will deliver at 100/100.
    Now obviously FTC is a complete supporter of the concept 
that if we go out, certainly, more than 8 to 10 years, optical 
fiber technology is likely to be the only service that will be 
able to meet the bandwidth demands that are currently 
projected. To be certain, the DOCIS 4.0, of the cable industry 
will serve very well in the interim, in many cases, as long as 
the networks are very sufficiently robust and well maintained.
    Nonetheless, if you look at existing capacity demands, and 
you go out beyond 8 to 10 years, you are forced to look at 
long-term solutions, which we firmly believe are best serviced 
by extending optical fiber as far as you possibly can, given 
the amount of funds that are available.
    Senator Tuberville. Mr. Forde.
    Mr. Forde. First of all, what we are seeing is as these 
speed thresholds have increased from 25/3 to 100/20, almost 100 
percent of the applications that we are seeing are for areas 
between 25/3 and 100/20. Therefore, nearly 100 percent of the 
remaining addresses in our highly rural areas that had less 
than 25/3 still remain at that. We are truly not accomplishing 
the fact of trying to get to those unserved addresses as these 
speed thresholds have increased.
    Certainly I would say that all of our technologies that we 
deploy, whether it is our fiber system, our hybrid fiber coax 
system, or our fixed wireless, they are all future-proof, and 
we have no issues with delivering higher speeds on any of those 
technologies. We do not find that any consumer cares how they 
got their broadband service as long as it is fast and reliable.
    Third, no consumers are using 100/100 symmetrical speeds. 
It is a download world. We want to provide the consumers with 
what they want and need today and tomorrow, and should not have 
to be providing 100-megabit upload speeds that nobody is using. 
Even during COVID, we saw very little increase in upload 
speeds. It is still 14 to 17 times higher in download speeds. 
It is a download world, not an upload world. We should not be 
building those networks for folks that are not using them.
    Senator Tuberville. Mr. Forde, you talked about how fiber 
deployment works in certain terrains, especially your area of 
the country. What broadband technologies have you seen deployed 
in these areas that actually work? I mean, what is the best 
availability for you?
    Mr. Forde. We like to use the best technology for our 
customer and your constituents, right. When you are talking 
about serving the last hard-to-reach areas, you know, you are 
talking about the Black Hills of South Dakota. You are talking 
about the Iron Range in northern Minnesota, right. Some of 
these areas have very tough geography. You could be dealing 
with as much as $100,000 per mile to drill through rock. You 
could be dealing with an eight- or nine-mile-long driveway. It 
is simply irresponsible to try to run fiber through some of 
these locations when a fast, reliable, fixed wireless 
connection can easily do the job and take care of the consumer.
    The other thing I will note, especially this winter, in the 
northern part of the country, we dealt with pretty much 8 
months of frozen ground. We were able to deploy fixed wireless 
technology to serve folks who needed it in blizzards. It simply 
would take years and uneconomical to run fiber through all 
those areas.
    Senator Tuberville. Mr. Johnson, have you got different 
parts in Alabama?
    Mr. Johnson. Yes, sir, and I would respectfully take issue 
with some of my colleague's assertions there, but I will try to 
keep it very fact-based.
    Approximately 20 percent of my consumer base now takes 
gigabit service. I am also routinely required to certify 
frequently to a number of employers in the Chattanooga, 
Tennessee, area that their employees, who are working from 
home, not voluntarily but as a requirement of their jobs, are 
able to receive both download and upload speeds at or greater 
than 100 megabits symmetrical service.
    Our experience with our user profiles is entirely different 
from his in that regard. To that end, I will tell you that 
consumers today will become very concerned with both their 
download and upload speeds when their demand requirements 
exceed them. Now granted, some of them today are not, but when 
those download speeds are no longer sufficient, they will care 
very much about them.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you.
    Mr. Forde. Just to clarify, we would stand ready to provide 
those download and upload speeds whenever our customers need 
them.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you.
    Senator Klobuchar. [Presiding.] I guess I am chairing, so I 
am calling on myself at this moment.
    Mr. Nishi, I am the Co-Chair of the Senate Broadband 
Caucus, along with several others, and we work to connect every 
American to high-speed broadband. Could you talk about why 
providing broadband internet high speed is a key rural 
development priority, and Mr. Johnson, what tools do we need to 
streamline and bolster USDA broadband?
    Mr. Nishi. Thank you for this question, Senator. Rural 
development in all of our areas is key, and getting the 
broadband out in the rural areas, it is needed, and it comes 
back to the whole concept of universal service, where we 
believe that rural areas should have reasonable and comparable 
services at reasonable and comparable rates to those in the 
urban areas.
    Now people can argue and say that the rural areas do not 
need symmetrical service, but I can say that architects, 
designers, and others do need the upload speed to do their 
jobs, and they should not be limited where they live by the 
broadband that they receive in the areas that they do live.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Very good. Mr. Johnson, jut 
quickly.
    Mr. Johnson. The most brief recap I can give you is 
meaningful improvements in permitting, especially at the 
Federal level, but really at all levels of government, allowing 
the concurrent expenditure of matching dollars with grant funds 
rather than forcing a full expenditure of the matching dollars 
up front will aid in the provision of capital across the board.
    Finally, coordination, especially with those in the 
Congress that are at oversight of the Federal Universal Service 
Fund. Remember that these grants build the networks. They do 
not sustain them or operate them.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Forde, thank you 
for mentioning the Iron Range, the birthplace of my dad. In 
your testimony you highlight your company's collaboration with 
farmers in Minnesota. How can we best ensure that farmers, 
ranchers, those in agriculture are getting connected at fast 
speeds, which is a bit of our goal out here?
    Mr. Forde. Well, thank you so much, Senator, and it is a 
pleasure to see you again and a pleasure to do so much great 
work around your State. We have got great projects going on, 
from International Falls, using ARPA dollars, along Lake of the 
Woods. We are building cities like Greenfield, Minnesota, and 
Annandale with 100 percent private capital.
    As you mentioned, in the Ag Committee we partnered with 
Land O'Lakes and we are using fixed wireless from grain 
elevators, which is providing an 8-mile circle of 100/20 
service to about 2,700 farms and ranches. The important thing 
about that is that provides that fast, reliable service not 
only to those farms and ranches but also other agriculture 
items that are located there. For the future of precision ag it 
is important that we reach sugar beet piling stations in the 
Red River Valley, grain dryers.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay.
    Mr. Forde. These things need connections as well, and we 
want to, again, provide the right connections for the ag 
community and all the different communities throughout 
Minnesota, and happy to continue to do that with so many great 
projects going around all across your State.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Mr. Nishi, back to you. You 
mentioned the MOU in your testimony, and could you talk about--
and this is the MOU, FCC, USDA, Treasury, this agreement to 
share information about reporting of data and metrics relating 
to broadband deployment, just because we have had issues. 
Senator Wicker and I have worked on this and passed a law to 
require this. I know you mentioned it. How can agencies work 
together better so we get accurate information?
    Mr. Nishi. The MOU really does help because that has shown 
that they have talked and that they have come to an agreement 
that they need to work together. There does need to be 
oversight from Congress to make sure that they are following 
the MOU and keeping them on track.
    I think it is something to where they are now working 
together, but it does need your oversight to ensure that they 
do stay on track.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Thank you.
    Mr. Shekleton, making sure consumers have reliable service 
is a 24/7 job. Could you talk about some of the difficulties 
providers face when they are ready to go with new projects but 
there are work force issues? I am a personal believer that we 
need to do something sane with immigration reform, including 
visa caps and work force permits, because we just do not have 
enough workers in some of the areas of jobs in rural America 
right now, including nursing homes and including tourism and 
including ag. So go ahead.
    Mr. Shekleton. Thank you, Senator, for the question, and 
yes, work force development is definitely a key issue and a 
challenge, and maybe arguably a growing challenge right now. We 
are making concerted efforts to basically mitigate that and try 
to get ahead of what is already a busy schedule with our build-
outs, and now with the looming BEAT funding allocations that 
are coming, the State of Illinois, for example, is right now, I 
believe, earmarked to get between $900 million and up to $1 
billion in BEAT funding.
    That is a lot of work to get done, and I can tell you, 
working on the front lines of rural America on a daily basis, 
the people want it yesterday. We need to get the work force up 
and running and trained before these allocations of funds are 
released, so that when the funds are released we have the 
people staffed up ready to go to work.
    We have an MOU locally. I think local outreach and 
collaboration activities are key. It is almost like a 
grassroots movement of work force development, if you will. We 
are working with local educators, community colleges, our local 
Illinois works group, and different CTE programs, and really 
trying to create these classroom-to-career pathways, because 
that truly is the feeder program to our future workers.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you.
    Senator Stabenow. [Presiding.] Well, good afternoon, and I 
want to thank both Chairman Welch and Ranking Member 
Tuberville. I am pleased to be here. Sorry to be late, but 
Senator Boozman and I, I think, are both running on the same 
schedule here this afternoon. In the absence, until Senator 
Welch returns, I will call on folks. First, Senator Boozman.
    Senator Boozman. No. Go ahead. I am going to be here.
    Senator Stabenow. Okay. Senator Fischer.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and thank you, 
Senator Boozman. I appreciate your graciousness. Thank you very 
much. Thank you to all of our witnesses for being here today.
    Broadband and connectivity overall is becoming essential to 
power modern agriculture. Farmers and ranchers are integrating 
under-soil sensors, variable rate irrigation, high-tech ear 
tags for livestock, and many other technologies into their 
operations.
    To make full use of precision agriculture innovation we 
need to close the gap and connect the last mile to the last 
acre. Producers need that connectivity that extends far past 
main residences. They need connectivity around farmland and 
ranchland. Coverage across acreage is not possible without both 
wired and wireless connections.
    Mr. Forde, do you think that Rural Development's broadband 
programs are missing an opportunity here to support producers 
and focus on last-acre connectivity, and should we be looking 
to make sure USDA has the right balance of both last-mile and 
last-acre resources?
    Mr. Forde. Yes. I could not agree more. We absolutely make 
sure that USDA is technology neutral. Our farm and agricultural 
communities that we serve, and throughout the Midwest, you 
know, we are simply not having fiber wires dragged behind 
combines. They will not be delivering that service to pastures. 
It is important that technology neutral future-proofs that for 
the future of the ag technology. Wireline will not always be 
the future. It is a wireless world that we live in. I 
appreciate your efforts to try to focus the technology that the 
ag community wants and needs for the future, so that technology 
they have is also future-proof for the acre.
    Senator Fischer. I appreciated your comments about the 
vastness of rural America and really sparsely populated area. 
You forgot to mention Nebraska, and the Nebraska San Hills, 
especially, where we are from. With less than 1 person per 
square mile it is important to be able to get to that last 
acre.
    Mr. Forde. That is why I think the Rural Internet 
Improvement Act that you and Senator Klobuchar have sponsored, 
along with Senator Thune and Senator Lujan will be so important 
to really focus on those last unserved areas in the Sand Hills, 
and make sure that those people get broadband first, and are 
first in line before other people are getting two or three or 
four bites at the apple, so to speak.
    We need to make sure that they get that service out there. 
We need to do that as fast as possible. In some of those areas 
you might have an eight- or nine-mile-long driveway.
    Senator Fischer. Or longer.
    Mr. Forde. At $50,000 to $60,000 a mile, that may take 
years to deploy a wireline service. If we can quickly and 
efficiently deploy a wireless service that is fast and reliable 
in the middle of winter, let's get that done, and let's get 
that person service tomorrow.
    Senator Fischer. You know, I view broadband as essential 
infrastructure. It is an investment in our country. It is an 
investment in the future. It is like rural electric lines going 
out and connecting all of the people in this country. It is 
like roads being built to connect people in this country. I 
think it is a right that every citizen should be able to have 
in order to have a future.
    I noticed, Mr. Forde, that there has been a lot of talk 
about using Federal broadband programs to future-proof 
networks, but that term is not in any statute. Can you tell the 
Committee what you think that means and whether your networks 
are future-proof?
    Mr. Forde. Yes. We will continue to invest to make sure all 
of our customers, rural customers, have the latest and greatest 
technology. We would not build a system, whether that be fiber, 
HFC, or fixed wireless that is not future-proof. They are all 
scalable. They are all made for the future of those residents. 
Nobody is building any networks today that are not future-
proof, regardless of technology.
    Senator Fischer. When it comes to farmland and ranchland, 
how do you future-proof that connectivity across acreage?
    Mr. Forde. You have got your multiple forms of technology 
out there ready to serve that agriculture customer in the way 
that they want. If a farmer calls and says they want their 
drain tile pump connected, their grain dryer, and their water 
pumping station, we would need to be able to take care of that 
issue today. It is simply unfeasible to run wires to locations 
that farmers might not even know where they need tomorrow.
    Senator Fischer. We are talking about rural development and 
being able--I view that as strengthening rural America, to be 
able to have that development. It begins and ends with 
agriculture, in my opinion, no matter the State you are in. 
Agriculture in rural environments is vital not just to those 
rural communities that they are near, but it is vital for the 
States themselves, and especially when you have big States 
there.
    Mr. Forde. It is such an exciting area. All of the 
development in ag tech is just tremendous, and we are excited 
to be part of that ecosystem.
    Senator Fischer. I am too. I am excited for this farm bill 
and looking at precision agriculture and making sure we have 
the connections there to have it work for everybody. Thank you 
very much.
    Mr. Forde. Thank you.
    Senator Welch. [Presiding.] Senator Stabenow. Thank you.
    Senator Stabenow. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. That was a 
quick vote. You are very fast. That is good.
    Senator Welch. Yes. My fast steps in. I am here with the 
coach.
    Senator Stabenow. I know.
    Mr. Walsh [continuing]. my time on the 40-yard dash.
    Senator Stabenow. Well, I want to thank both of you. I am 
really excited to work with both of you, Mr. Chairman and 
Ranking Member, as well as with our Ranking Member on the 
Committee, because high-speed internet is not a luxury. I mean, 
I grew up in rural Michigan. We all know it, but the pandemic 
sure showed us that it was not. I grew up in a small town where 
the hospital was incredibly important. My mom was head of 
nursing at a very small hospital, but telemedicine happened. 
Too many stories that I have heard of kids sitting in the fast-
food restaurant parking lot trying to get Wi-Fi to do their 
homework, or they are going to the only library, or wherever it 
is.
    This is so important, and I want to say, I am glad we got 
additional dollars in the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill. I 
think that USDA Rural Development's success in deploying high 
speed internet is very, very important. We have seen it 
firsthand in Michigan. I think USDA, the ReConnect program, 
really important. I appreciate the work being done on that. 
Using $34 million and a grant from ReConnect, our Upper 
Peninsula telephone company will deploy a fiber-to-the-premises 
network to connect over 1,600 Michiganders to high-speed 
internet, and that is a big deal up in the UP. I am looking 
forward to working with all of us to be able to do in the farm 
bill more so that we can connect all our farmers and 
communities, small businesses, hospitals, everybody in rural 
communities. We want people having a high quality of life. They 
go away to college, and we want them coming home to small towns 
and being a part of that, and high-speed internet is really 
important.
    Mr. Shekleton, what do you believe the Committee should 
consider when looking at the minimum acceptable speed when 
evaluating if a household is served? Additionally, what do you 
believe should be the minimum required build-out speeds for 
applicants to the ReConnect program?
    Mr. Shekleton. Thank you for the question, Senator. I 
believe that a speed to consider a premise served should be 
100/100, and that should also be the minimum required build-out 
speed. I think we need to standardize on a definition and 
finally move forward with what we have been talking about as a 
scalable and future-proof solution. It sounds to me like the 
definition of scalable and future-proof seems to be somewhat 
subject to interpretation.
    If we take a trip down memory lane, for example, there were 
industry experts, in 2003, who were stating that by 2005, the 
average household would need one megabit of service, and there 
were other industry experts that thought they were crazy, that 
that would never happen.
    Fast forward to 2010. The FCC's definition increased to 4/
1. Fast forward to 2015, that is when it established 25/3.
    If we are only looking at what is in front of us and we are 
simply meeting the needs of today, are we really giving 
consideration to the innovation and ingenuity of the American 
people? I do not think we are. I think when we look at the 
future and we look at the trends and the data that scale out to 
needing multi-gigabit speeds by 2030, that is absolutely, 
positively something that can happen and become a reality.
    When we say future-proof, I think we need to make sure that 
we do invest wisely with these precious tax dollars, and if 
this truly is a once-in-a-generation opportunity with this 
funding, then we get one shot to do it right. Thank you.
    Senator Stabenow. Thank you. Building on that, Mr. Nishi, 
some may say that symmetrical internet connections are 
unnecessary for most rural customers. Why should USDA 
prioritize building symmetrical networks, and what are some of 
the long-term benefits of these connections?
    Mr. Nishi. I will come back to the whole concept of 
universal service where there should be reasonable, comparable 
services at reasonable, comparable rates, in urban and rural 
areas.
    A designer or an architect or someone that is living in a 
rural area, to run their business they may need 100/100 so that 
they can upload their work. It is really coming back to a 
fairness and equitableness across all areas in the U.S.
    Senator Stabenow. Thank you. I will close, Mr. Chairman. I 
just want to say that I think it is so important that we are 
doing our best to create high quality in rural communities, and 
not just say a little bit is enough. You know, it is not just 
enough to be able to get a few streaming TV shows or something, 
that we need to be talking about rural communities and rural 
businesses and hospitals and farmers and so on having the same 
high quality that is in our urban areas. I hope, from my 
perspective, we are going to be able to move in that direction.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Welch. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Ranking Member Boozman, thank you. It is good to be back. I 
worked with him in the House.
    Senator Boozman. I know, and we appreciate your friendship.
    Senator Welch. I heard he has gotten even better in the 
Senate. He was pretty good in the House.
    Senator Boozman. Well, you are doing pretty good in the 
Senate yourself, and we appreciate you, Mr. Chairman, and 
Senator Tuberville, this is a great hearing. In fact, I think 
this is one of the--you know, just echoing what the Chairwoman 
said--I think this is one of the most important hearings that 
we have. When you look at climate, when you look at trying to 
get cleaner air, cleaner water, healthier soils, I think the 
underpinning in the future is going to be depending on 
technology that is going to be dependent on broadband.
    We used to think in terms of the three Rs and waters is how 
you developed an area--roads, railroads, runways, and throw 
water in. Then you have got the potential for development. If 
you do not have broadband, you simply are not going to develop, 
and with the loss of population in rural America, as the 
Chairwoman said, not only do we need it, but we need it at 
strengths that we can actually do something with it.
    Mr. Forde, according to a GAO report published last year, 
there are currently more than 100 programs administered by 15 
agencies that could be used to expand broadband access. Yet 
despite numerous programs and a Federal investment of $44 
billion from 2015 through 2020, millions of Americans still 
lack broadband. That is what we are talking about. With 
billions more authorized and spent since 2020, through 
ReConnect and other programs across government, have you seen a 
noticeable reduction in the number of unserved locations in 
rural and hard-to-reach areas of the States in which Midco 
operates?
    Mr. Forde. No. In fact, we have hardly seen that needle 
move at all. That is because none of the funding sources 
actually target the people without broadband.
    Senator Boozman. What do we do to close the digital divide?
    Mr. Forde. We absolutely need to make sure that people with 
no broadband are served first, before anybody else gets any 
other funding to upgrade previously existing systems.
    Senator Boozman. Okay. That is clear. We appreciate that.
    Another issue that comes up, as I meet with constituents in 
Arkansas--and I think all of us could say this--I often hear 
complaints about the ReConnect application process. According 
to one provider who we spoke with recently, their staff spent 
more than 300 hours just to complete one application.
    Has anyone on the panel had a similar experience? If so, do 
you have recommendations to how we can streamline the process?
    Mr. Forde. Thank you for the question, Senator. Yes, we 
have looked at the ReConnect application, but it simply is very 
difficult for private capital. Putting the government to have 
the first lien on assets, information about what we are doing 
throughout our footprint and build-out plans and some of the 
other requirements, as well as of course, yes, the lengthy 
pages and details just certainly make it almost unworkable for 
design to work with companies such as ourselves.
    Again, we hope that the Rural Internet Improvement Act will 
give us some access to help us reach those areas that we are 
talking about that are truly unserved with a grant program such 
as this.
    Ms. Shute. May I add to that?
    Senator Boozman. Yes, ma'am.
    Ms. Shute. Thank you. We recently applied for both 
ReConnect 3 and Reconnect 4, so it is fresh in our mind. This 
is the application----
    Senator Boozman. You look traumatized.
    Ms. Shute. A little bit. This is the application without 
any of the supporting documentation.
    I have two recommendations. The first is that for 
ReConnect, for Community Connect, even for the Broadband 
Technical Assistance Program, we should make it a two-step 
application process. They are points based, right? If we have a 
pretty simple form that people can fill out then the 
application process can weed out the bottom four-fifths of 
applications that do not have a fighting chance of doing it. 
Then when you are investing the time, you have at least the 
knowledge that you have got a pretty good shot at getting 
funding and that you are going to get it back.
    I think one of the things to recognize is what is required 
to do this. Part of it is extremely detailed budgets and 
financials. We are talking 10 years of budgets and financials 
that integrate with your existing budgets and then move 
forward. In order to do the kind of detailed budget that 
ReConnect asks for, which is very detailed, you effectively 
have to do a design. If you are a small provider, you cannot 
invest in a design for an area that you cannot afford to build 
until you have knowledge that you are going to be able to go 
there.
    We were fortunate to be able to raise money to use 
consultants to do it. We could not have done it without the 
consultants.
    The second big lift, in USDA in particular, is that there 
is a difference in information that is used. USDA uses 
households. We use premises. The BDC maps is someplace in 
between those two things. When you put in the number of people 
that are going to take service every year, under every single 
service offering, it does not match what is going on, so it 
does not match your financials. In other words, we just need to 
streamline the data that we are using, the mapping, the 
household premises, but most importantly, let's do a two-step 
application process for all of these grant programs.
    Senator Boozman. Very good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Welch. Senator Braun.
    Senator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When I was in the 
Indiana Statehouse back in 1915, 1916, and 1917, we are a 
State, first of all, that always has cash-flow. We invest. We 
are right now in the process of putting money into rural 
broadband. What we did, and what was unique, and I was part of 
it, was it had never been done before on road funding, for 
instance. When it was proposed, it was called Community 
Crossings. That is where the State government put out--I think 
we started with a $1 million fund, per municipality or county 
government, up to which they could match. First of all, 
everybody complained about it, No. 1, because they did not want 
any skin in the game. Now they want even higher levels of 
putting skin in the game and want more money from the State to 
do it.
    What about taking the same idea currently with broadband, 
and whatever we do here, reward more to folks back in the 
States, in the places trying to do it, and maybe, for the 
places that are not getting it, for whatever the arbitrary 
reason might be, to where they would be given preference based 
upon putting more of their own skin in the game.
    I will ask Mr. Johnson and Mr. Forde what you think about 
that.
    Mr. Johnson. Senator, I would tell you that on a very 
personal note I think you are right on. Having sufficient 
investment by potential providers in the game is absolutely 
essential to avoiding, respectfully, the entrance into the 
market by fly by-nights that are simply taking an opportunity 
for short-term gain without a long-term commitment to the 
sustainability of those networks.
    I have always personally argued that minimum requirements 
such as 20, 25 percent are essential, first of all, but I also 
encourage other kinds of skin in the game such as a 
demonstrated history of delivering the service, or, for lack of 
better terms, some form of sufficient evidence that they are 
capable of delivering on the promise. Whether that is a 
government entity or a private entity, you are still on track. 
The more skin in the game they have, the more likely they are 
to be successful.
    Mr. Forde. Yes, from Midco's experience we will not take 
more than any public dollars that are needed. There are some 
State programs that we participated in where we had our Midco 
contribution be as high as possible and take as little of 
taxpayer dollars as possible to fund build-out to those areas 
to make it feasible for private capital. We are always doing 
that.
    I recently out, in one of the States we serve, that we are 
now the only provider in the State that is extending to homes 
surrounding our current network without asking the government 
for more money.
    Senator Braun. I think another good reason is we are 
currently running deficits that we have never seen in the 
history of our country, and getting more cost sharing from 
folks back home would seem to make sense to stretch what I 
think is going to be a more difficult Federal dollar to get 
ahold of.
    What I hear often in traveling around the State, as well, 
and it may have been addressed earlier, but would be some of 
the regulations involved that are currently in place that 
constitute what a suitable level of service would be. It is 
clear that in the very rural areas it is close to zero. We are 
dealing with that currently, and I think addressing it pretty 
well in Indiana.
    The places where I heard it has been most difficult is 
where some of the biggest providers provide the internet 
service, where you have got customers per mile in any place 
where you have got population. When you drift into that kind of 
a twilight zone between the very rural and the places just 
outside of the so-called well-served areas, and then you are 
using peculiar formulas that seem to keep so many people in a 
place where it is not that far away, the big providers do not 
seem very anxious to even go anywhere if it does not have the 
density, and then hide behind formulas to keep them from 
serving those areas that I have described.
    Anyone that wants to weigh in on that? We will start over 
with Mr. Forde, and Mr. Johnson, and whoever else wants to come 
in.
    Mr. Forde. I can say we absolutely love those areas, and we 
love building them all with 100 percent private capital. We 
have the financial business model that works perfect for us to 
build in all those areas. We are doing that around all of our 
cities throughout the Midwest.
    Senator Braun. Are you ever running into issues where even 
though you want to do it, you cannot because there is some 
regulation or formula that keeps you from going in there?
    Mr. Forde. You know, not so much on the financials, but 
occasionally there are permitting issues. Certainly things such 
as fair access to poles, crossing railroad tracks, 
environmental rules and regulations, crossing rivers. You know, 
those are some of the barriers that we see in some of those 
areas that, you know, slow us down, at the very least, from 
getting broadband out to those folks who are just across the 
tracks, so to speak.
    Senator Braun. Thank you.
    Mr. Johnson. I commend him for his use of private capital. 
It is extremely important that we remember this. The reason all 
of rural America does not have broadband is because 
historically there has been insufficient economic incentive to 
attract private capital to get that job done. It will not 
happen without government subsidy. That is the only business 
case.
    To your point about adequate technology, I would 
respectfully submit that some of that debate can be resolved if 
we ever take the time to actually look at the physical 
properties and the physical capabilities of the various tools 
we are using to deploy broadband. It will answer a lot of the 
questions about what is and is not future-proof technology.
    Senator Braun. Anybody else want to briefly weigh in?
    Ms. Shute. I think it is about developing the basic 
infrastructure. When we look at the areas in that twilight zone 
between the very rural and the urban, I think the BEAD program 
is going to be able to address that. What ReConnect needs to 
address is the areas that go back from that, and the 
infrastructure is what we are building on, just like we did 
with rural electrification. That is what takes us into the 
future.
    Mr. Nishi. I would like to add that 100 in rural 100 is 
important. The Fiber Broadband Association Nucleus study shows 
that in 2023, households are already using 100/100. At the same 
time, there are those that said the Rounds 3 and 4 ReConnect 
should not have those standards in it, but at the same time it 
was four to five times oversubscribed. There are many people 
out there that believe in 100/100 networks.
    Ms. Shute. Could I just add that I think one of the 
challenges that some rural States face is that when you have 
25/3 wireless technology that provides spotty service 
throughout an area, you can become disqualified from a grant 
program. The entire State of Vermont is basically going to be 
disqualified from ReConnect 5 as it currently stands, and yet 
those folks, a lot of them have less than 4 down, 1 up, from a 
wired connection. When you live in rural areas, like many parts 
of the country, with a lot of hills and mountains and weather, 
that wireless service does not always exist, and that is why we 
need to get to those folks and to provide a level that makes 
sure everyone has a wired connection.
    Mr. Shekleton. I would just like to comment on one part of 
Mr. Forde's comments, that we feel that pole attachments are 
not a barrier to deployment of broadband. In fact, in the 
cooperative space we are an at-cost model. We do not make any 
profit off of that. It is specifically the at-cost model of 
each co-op, depending on its geographic location of the system 
that it operates in their well-maintained facilities, and there 
has actually been proven evidence where cooperatives have 
offered other entities to come in at zero dollars as long as 
they promise to bring robust, reliable high-speed internet to 
every one of their members, and there was no response.
    Senator Braun. Thank you.
    Senator Welch. Senator Tuberville.
    Senator Tuberville. Yes, I have got one question here. Mr. 
Forde and Mr. Johnson, why is it so important to keep the 
required percentages of unserved locations within an awarded 
area as high as possible, and not lower it to 50 percent, as 
the most recent ReConnect round of funding does, to 
successfully deploy broadband to the most rural areas?
    Mr. Johnson. I will go back to my original comment. There 
are reasonable arguments that can be made on both ends of that 
spectrum where that should be. The reality of it is, if we are 
talking long-term solutions and limited dollars. The lower that 
threshold, commonly somewhere between 80, 85, 90 percent, 
historically, the lower that threshold, I can assure you the 
higher probability that scarce taxpayer dollars will be used to 
improve existing networks at the expense of those who have 
nothing or completely inadequate, service.
    Mr. Forde. Absolutely. We have to focus on these truly 
unserved areas. The percentages have to be 90 or higher for all 
of these programs, to ensure that those people with nothing get 
served first, before we can look at folks that need financial 
help to upgrade in the areas, if they need that.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you, and----
    Ms. Shute. I think----
    Senator Tuberville. Yes, go ahead.
    Ms. Shute. Sorry. I think it is critical that the 
percentage be part of the point system. That is what USDA has 
done, right. If there is an eligibility level, but then there 
is a point system that enables the understanding of RUS staff 
of what is on the ground. Because every State is different. We 
just simply have different needs. We are looking to get to the 
most unserved. The way to do that is to allow USDA to put point 
systems in place, as it already has, to accommodate those.
    Senator Tuberville. One other question, to whoever wants to 
answer this. We are probably going to need to know this. When 
we get in all these deep rural areas, what is the most 
burdensome permitting issue that we have, and we are going to 
have, coming up, you know, going into these rural areas. 
Anybody want to--throw your two cents' worth in.
    Ms. Shute. I would say that the most burdensome is the 
make-ready licensing. A lot of the most rural areas are 
cooperatives that had to cut across farmlands that are now 
trees and forests and no longer farmland. There is a high cost 
there.
    I also think a two-step application can help us get through 
the Federal permitting process by starting the process at the 
end of the first step, so that by the time we get the 
application we can start working. We are going to have to wait 
to get through that Federal permitting process, and we are 
ready to go on the ground right now, today, if we could.
    Mr. Nishi. To keep the application process running and get 
approvals quicker, we believe that there should be some shot 
clocks for the various agencies, where if they do not get the 
approval in time it is deemed approved.
    At the same time, there are areas where it was previously 
disturbed, where we need to go through permit process, even 
though we already may have cable there. That approval needs to 
speed up also. They are ready, so why do we need to go through 
the whole process again.
    Finally, there are a lot more applications now with all the 
money out there in builds, so we need to make sure that the 
various agencies are adequately staff in approving these 
applications.
    Mr. Johnson. Senator, FTC has not encountered this for 
unique reasons. Across the country, many of our colleagues face 
considerable difficulty with right-of-way when it pertains to 
the railroads.
    Mr. Forde. Yes, I think anything we can do to streamline 
the processes for all the Federal agencies, you know, in 
applications, would be very helpful to serve rural America. 
Certainly if our application works for the FCC, it should work 
for USDA, from that perspective. You know, the environmental 
for crossing rivers has been extremely difficult with the Army 
Corps and the myriad of agencies to deal with there. I would 
echo the comments of others in those agencies. Streamlining 
those processes in the names of broadband will help us deploy a 
lot faster. I do not think you can tackle just one. I think we 
need to tackle them all, because every situation is different.
    Senator Welch. Senator Boozman?
    Senator Boozman. Yes, very quickly if it is Okay. Just 
following up on the permitting process, you know, the 
difficulties, I was going to ask about forest land, Federal 
forest land, and how difficult that is. You have got pretty 
stringent timeframes with RUS and other things. Those processes 
can last forever, you know, in the sense of the permitting.
    Should Congress in the farm bill require the Forest 
Service, which happens to fall under the jurisdiction of the 
USDA, to expedite the approval process for projects supported 
by Federal broadband deployment programs?
    Does anybody want to jump in on that one? Do not worry. 
They are not going to treat you any worse than they do now.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Boozman. You do not have to comment if you do not 
want to. Again, this is something that we need to work on, 
especially when you have two agencies are trying to do one 
thing with one agency that is a very good thing, you know, when 
you have got another agency that sometimes is not quite as 
helpful as we would like for them to be.
    Mr. Johnson. Senator, I will brave the question. Yes, 
absolutely, and you have jurisdiction.
    I would just simply remind, it is a governmentwide issue. 
There are a lot of permits, a lot of issues, from 
environmental, all with legitimate concerns. Either we will do 
better as a country in resolving those questions expeditiously, 
or people will not get broadband as quickly as we need them to.
    Senator Boozman. Right. Again, I am not saying that they do 
not do the appropriate protocols, but let us do it in an 
expeditious way so you all can get to work and get things done. 
Yes, sir.
    Mr. Forde. Yes. I will add that, yes, in some of those 
Forest Service areas that we have seen, if there is an existing 
road, right-of-way, an easement, where a road is going through 
the Forest Service already, I mean, the ability to just access 
that with a limited fast permit process makes total sense, 
rather than having to go through a whole separate process or 
create a whole separate easement to go through those areas that 
are already ready to be deployed.
    Senator Boozman. Right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Welch. We are going to wait a few minutes. Senator 
Lujan is on his way back from the vote and wants to ask a few 
questions. I will sort of give a semi-closing statement.
    First of all, this is an incredibly helpful hearing in 
getting a cross-section that each of you has experience. You 
know, a couple of things. One, there seems to be uniformity 
that having a simplified application process really is 
beneficial.
    No. 2, Senator Braun's question about skin in the game, and 
you explained part of that as financial, but part of it is a 
history of success and accomplishment, because there are a lot 
of areas in rural America where the capital is just not there. 
A big decision that Congress made with rural electrification 
was that it was worth to do it, for political and social 
reasons. It was not because it was economically beneficial to 
do it. I think a lot of us on this Committee think the 
political and social reasons are really good reasons.
    Then I heard uniformity about let's not tax the grants. The 
grant you thought was 10X turns out to be 7X. I would be bummed 
out. You do not like that.
    Then the permit process, and there are two parts to that. 
The Federal, which we would have some jurisdiction over, but 
then local, where every locality is different, but hopefully 
get some cooperation.
    You know, the big issue here, that I think is a major 
policy question, is this future-proofing. That is the term that 
we are using. What it means to me is we cannot give second-
class service to rural America, and I think Senator Stabenow 
really used a phrase I like, ``Good enough is not good enough, 
because it is good enough for today.'' We do not get anywhere 
unless we make a commitment that good enough is what is good 
enough for everybody.
    One of the reasons, by the way--there are all kinds of 
reasons, but we are trying to get folks to come into rural 
America, and in Vermont, when somebody is looking at a house, 
if they are not where there is high-speed internet, and it is a 
person who might want to be moving up, that is the end of the 
deal. That is it. They are not coming. We have got to get jobs 
and entrepreneurs and folks back into rural America, and those 
people will not come unless there is confidence that they have 
got sustainable, high-speed, state-of-the-art internet. That is 
a design question the engineers know about it.
    We are all disappointed that Senator Lujan cannot make it 
here, because he is a big champion, and a wonderful Senator.
    We have finished with this hearing. It was really terrific. 
I think what you saw, and you are experiencing, I hope, is that 
there is a bipartisan commitment from members of the U.S. 
Senate who have a commitment to rural America. We come from 
different parties and have different political points of view, 
but there is a strong unity here that the importance of rural 
America cannot be a second-class part of America.
    We will keep the record open for five days for any 
additional questions from members or submissions from 
witnesses. With that I declare the hearing over.

    [Whereupon, at 4:45 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
