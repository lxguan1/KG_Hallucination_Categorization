    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:17 p.m. in 
Room 1324, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Tom Tiffany 
[Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding.
    Present: Tiffany, Fulcher, Stauber; Neguse, Leger 
Fernandez, and Grijalva.
    Mr. Tiffany. The Subcommittee on Federal Lands will come to 
order.
    Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a 
recess of the Subcommittee at any time.
    The Subcommittee is meeting today to consider four bills: 
H.R. 1657, Representative Stauber's Lake Winnibigoshish Land 
Exchange Act; H.R. 3107, Ranking Member Neguse's Improving 
Outdoor Recreation Coordination Act; H.R. 3200, Representative 
Zinke's Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement Act; and 
H.R. 4984, Representative Comer's D.C. Robert F. Kennedy 
Memorial Stadium Campus Revitalization Act.
    I ask unanimous consent that Representative Zinke of 
Montana be allowed to participate in today's hearing from the 
dais.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    Under Committee Rule 4(f), any oral opening statements at 
hearings are limited to the Chairman and the Ranking Minority 
Member. I therefore ask unanimous consent that all other 
Members' opening statements be made part of the hearing record 
if they are submitted in accordance with Committee Rule 3(o).
    Without objection, so ordered.
    I will now recognize myself for an opening statement.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. TOM TIFFANY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN

    Mr. Tiffany. Today, the Subcommittee on Federal Lands 
continues our work developing a comprehensive recreation 
package.
    While the House was away from DC during the August recess, 
we were busy at work. We had boots on the ground all across the 
country meeting with people, and hearing about the issues 
everyday Americans are facing. This Committee held a hearing in 
Yosemite. While the hearing focused on the need for forest 
management and combating the wildfire crisis, I was reminded 
how valuable these iconic places are to Americans who recreate 
there. Having had my first opportunity to go there is 
spectacular.
    Engaging in outdoor activities, whether it is hiking, 
camping, hunting, fishing, or simply spending time in nature is 
not just important to us as individuals. It is part of our 
nation's heritage. Despite the important role public lands play 
in outdoor recreation, there are often conflicting levels of 
access to the land and facilities provided by Federal land 
managers, and convoluted policies among the various agencies. 
That is exactly what the bills on today's agenda seek to 
address.
    The bills we are considering today would increase access to 
public land, enhance coordination among the Federal land 
management agencies, reduce bureaucracy, and provide for the 
long-term planning of two important recreation sites.
    Representative Zinke's bill, the Gateway Community and 
Recreation Enhancement Act, will support gateway communities, 
create better data on visitation to develop a digital pass so 
Americans can access the park with their mobile device. 
Importantly, the bill requires the National Park Service to 
engage with local stakeholders before closing or reducing 
access to a park, except for health and safety risks.
    Last year, visitors to national parks generated a record 
high of over $50 billion in economic benefits and supported 
over 378,000 jobs. Legislation like Representative Zinke's bill 
will help gateway communities build on this success and 
continue to grow their rural economies by creating reliable, 
dependable access to Federal lands.
    I would also like to highlight legislation from my 
neighbor, Representative Stauber, that would provide certainty 
and predictability to a favorite hunting and fishing lodge in 
his district on Lake Winnibigoshish. H.R. 1657, the Lake 
Winnibigoshish Land Exchange Act of 2023, would facilitate a 
land exchange between the owners of the lodge and the Forest 
Service. I would like to commend Representative Stauber for 
years of hard work he has put into crafting this locally-driven 
solution that will benefit his constituents.
    Like Representative Stauber's legislation, Representative 
Comer's D.C. Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus 
Revitalization Act is a locally-driven solution that would 
provide for increased recreation here, in Washington, DC. The 
legislation before us represents years of negotiations to 
ensure a long-term solution for the future development and use 
of the 142 acres of land known as the RFK Memorial Stadium 
campus. To promote and enhance outdoor recreation, the bill 
ensures any development of the site will maintain at least 30 
percent parks and open space, and ensure access to the 
Anacostia River and Anacostia River Trail.
    Finally, Ranking Member Neguse and Representative Lawler's 
bipartisan bill, H.R. 3107, the Improving Outdoor Recreation 
Coordination Act, would establish the Federal Interagency 
Council on Outdoor Recreation to coordinate policies among the 
various land management agencies. I am interested in learning 
more about this proposal, and whether it could potentially 
decrease bureaucracy and redundancies among the Federal land 
management agencies.
    Each of these bills addresses a unique aspect of outdoor 
recreation, from rural to urban communities, local to national 
issues, and from immediate issues to long-term planning. I 
thank each of the sponsors of today's bills for their 
commitment and work.
    I would also like to thank our panel of witnesses for being 
here today to offer your unique expertise in the field of 
outdoor recreation.
    With that, I will now recognize Ranking Member Neguse.
    And Ranking Member Neguse is not here at this point, so 
let's go into our first panel.
    I would just highlight for our panel we do have votes that 
are coming up at 2:30, and we are going to get as far as we 
can, and then we will go vote.
    Let me remind the witnesses that under Committee Rules, you 
must limit your oral statement to 5 minutes, but your entire 
statement will appear in the hearing record.
    To begin your testimony, please press the ``on'' button on 
the microphone.
    We use timing lights. When you begin, the light will turn 
green. At the end of 5 minutes, the light will turn red, and I 
will ask you to please complete your statement.
    I would like to introduce Mr. Mike Reynolds, the Deputy 
Director of Congressional and External Relations at the 
National Park Service.
    Deputy Director Reynolds, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF MIKE REYNOLDS, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, CONGRESSIONAL AND 
   EXTERNAL RELATIONS, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, WASHINGTON, DC

    Mr. Reynolds. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Chairman Tiffany, 
Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the Subcommittee for this 
opportunity to present the Department of the Interior's views 
on three of the bills on today's agenda. I would like to submit 
our full statement for the record and summarize the 
Department's views.
    H.R. 3107 would require the Secretary of the Interior to 
establish the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor 
Recreation, or FICOR, composed of most of the agencies that 
manage Federal lands and waters for recreation purposes.
    The bill would require FICOR to meet as frequently as 
appropriate to coordinate recreation policies across Federal 
agencies, including implementation of the Federal Lands 
Recreation Enhancement Act and many other matters. The 
legislation would provide a statutory basis for FICOR, which is 
currently administratively established, through a July 2022 
Memorandum of Understanding among the agencies.
    Since the MOU was signed, FICOR has developed an 
operational charter and a 2-year work plan, focusing 
coordination on priority topics such as permitting and fees, 
partnerships, visitor use planning, youth engagement, and more.
    The Department supports H.R. 3107, with amendments to make 
the bill consistent, to the extent possible, with the July MOU. 
We would also recommend language that assures long-term 
sustainability for funding and capacity, and that all land and 
water management agencies currently participating in FICOR be 
included.
    H.R. 3200 would require the Department of the Interior and 
the U.S. Forest Service to carry out certain activities related 
to recreational opportunities. These activities include 
collaborating with other entities to better understand and 
address gateway community needs, providing public involvement 
in decisions that reduce access to national park units, 
establishing a single visitation data reporting system for 
recreation visits to Federal and tribal lands, and establishing 
a digital National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass.
    The Department supports the intent of H.R. 3200, but would 
like to work with the sponsor and the Committee on certain 
provisions of the bill. We are broadly supportive of 
congressional efforts to provide Federal land management 
agencies with greater authorities and flexibilities to respond 
to changing needs and evolving challenges in a time of 
increased visitation to our public lands. We would welcome the 
opportunity to continue collaborating with you to advance these 
goals.
    H.R. 4984 would direct the transfer of administrative 
jurisdiction of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium campus 
from the National Park Service to the General Services 
Administration, and direct the development of a new 99-year 
lease between the GSA and the District of Columbia. The lease 
would permit a number of uses, including a stadium and 
commercial and residential development, subject to the approval 
of the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission 
of Fine Arts.
    The Department supports the goals of H.R. 4984. Our 
principal interest is ensuring that the legislation provides 
sufficient protection for park and recreational areas that the 
National Park Service has long been responsible for 
administering in this part of the District, where the former 
stadium and adjacent park lands are located.
    Importantly, from our perspective, the lease would require 
that the District ensure that any commercial or residential 
development not adversely impact lands under the National Park 
Service's jurisdiction; that 30 percent of the leased land be 
designated as parks and open space; and that development 
provides for access to the Anacostia River and does not 
interrupt the Anacostia River Trail.
    The Department would like to recommend some amendments to 
the bill as drafted. Furthermore, we would ask for your support 
as the bill advances through the legislative process to ensure 
that it continues to provide for the protection of a sufficient 
amount of land for open space and park and recreation purposes, 
consistent with the Federal Government's historic commitment to 
that goal. We look forward to working with you toward that end.
    Mr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony and I am happy to 
answer any questions that you or other members of the 
Subcommittee may have.

    [The prepared statement of Mr. Reynolds follows:]
    Prepared Statement of Michael T. Reynolds, Deputy Director for 
                 Congressional and External Relations,
         National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior
                 on H.R. 3107, H.R. 3200, and H.R. 4984

H.R. 3107, ``Improving Outdoor Recreation Coordination Act''

    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the Department 
of the Interior's views on H.R. 3107, to direct the Secretary of the 
Interior to establish the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor 
Recreation.
    The Department supports H.R. 3107 with amendments. The Department 
defers to the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Army, 
and the Department of Commerce regarding their views on this bill's 
provisions, particularly as they affect the U.S. Forest Service, the 
Corps of Engineers, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, 
respectively.
    H.R. 3107 would require the Secretary of the Interior to establish 
the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation (FICOR), composed 
of the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bureau of 
Reclamation, the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 
and the National Marine Fisheries Service. The bill would require FICOR 
to meet as frequently as appropriate to coordinate recreation policies 
across Federal agencies, including implementation of the Federal Lands 
Recreation Enhancement Act and many other matters that are common to 
agencies that manage Federal lands and waters for recreational 
purposes. The legislation would provide a statutory basis for FICOR, 
which is currently administratively established.
    Our Nation's public lands, waters, and the fish and wildlife they 
support are an important resource for the American public. These places 
provide a diversity of outdoor recreation experiences for tens of 
millions of Americans each day and improve the social well-being of 
urban and rural communities across the United States. These 
recreational opportunities are supported by agency work both on and off 
federal lands. Outdoor recreation also contributes significantly to the 
national economy and the economies of local communities.
    Federal land and water management agencies have long-standing 
responsibilities for the conservation and sustainable use of the 
resources within the places they manage. The need for interagency 
coordination of Federal departments and agencies with the 
responsibility to manage lands and waterways for outdoor recreation has 
a history dating back to at least 1946 with the development of the 
Federal Recreation Committee, which was soon after redesignated as the 
Federal Inter-Agency Committee on Recreation. Since then, there have 
been several iterations of this organized coordination, including the 
most recent Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation 
reestablishment in July 2022 through a Memorandum of Agreement (MOU) 
signed by the Secretaries or Assistant Secretaries of the Department of 
Agriculture, the Department of the Army (Civil Works), the Department 
of Commerce (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), and 
the Department of the Interior. Collectively, these agencies manage an 
area of more than 730 million non-overlapping acres that consist of 
parks, lakes, monuments, wild and scenic rivers, Reclamation water 
projects, wildlife refuges and fish hatcheries, forests, and marine 
sanctuaries and wilderness areas.
    The overall goal of the FICOR, as defined in the recent MOU, is to 
institutionalize and facilitate better coordination and collaboration 
among Federal agencies whose missions or programs include providing 
outdoor recreation and conserving or sustainably managing natural and 
cultural resources. FICOR provides a framework to address common 
outdoor recreation-related challenges and opportunities since each of 
these land and water management agencies are also facing similar 
challenges related to balancing resource protection, local 
environmental and economic vitality, and visitor use and enjoyment.
    Many of these agencies have also recently benefited from 
significant Federal investments to address critical needs and improve 
the visitor and outdoor recreation experiences provided through the 
Great American Outdoors Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the 
Inflation Reduction Act.
    Since FICOR's 2022 reestablishment, the agencies have collectively 
developed an Operational Charter and a two-year workplan focusing 
coordination on priority topics which include permitting and fees, 
policy and regulations, equitable workforce, outdoor recreation for 
all, intergovernmental and community collaboration, partnerships, youth 
engagement, data and technology, and visitor use planning. The workplan 
also includes coordination to ensure the long-term sustainability of 
FICOR through identifying funding and establishing a well-vetted 
organizational structure.
    The Department would appreciate the opportunity to work with the 
sponsor and the Committee on amendments to make the bill consistent, to 
the extent possible, with the July 2022 interagency MOU, including the 
areas identified for coordination. We would also recommend language 
that assures long-term sustainability for funding and capacity, as well 
as a federal family approach not driven by any one agency but rather 
managed equally between Departments. DOI also recommends that all the 
land and water management agencies currently participating in FICOR be 
included in the proposed legislation, including by acknowledging that 
the definitions referenced in the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement 
Act do not apply to all the agencies currently participating and 
referenced in the FICOR MOU.
H.R. 3200, ``Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement Act''

    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the Department 
of the Interior's views on H.R. 3200, to require the Secretary of 
Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to carry out certain 
activities to enhance recreational opportunities for gateway 
communities, to amend the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to 
provide for the establishment of a digital National Parks and Federal 
Recreational Lands Pass, and for other purposes.
    The Department supports the intent of H.R. 3200, but would like to 
work with the sponsor and the Committee on certain provisions of the 
bill. The Department defers to the Department of Agriculture for its 
views regarding provisions that affect the U.S. Forest Service.
    Section 3 of H.R. 3200 directs the Secretaries of the Interior and 
Agriculture to collaborate with State and local governments, Tribal 
governments, housing authorities, applicable trade associations, 
nonprofit organizations, and other relevant stakeholders to improve the 
understanding of the economic impacts of visitation on gateway 
communities and identify community needs, including housing shortages, 
demands on existing municipal infrastructure, and accommodation and 
management of sustainable visitation. The bill further directs the 
Secretaries to use existing authorities to seek to address the 
identified community needs by entering into agreements with gateway 
communities; offering corresponding leases, rights-of-way, or 
easements; entering into public-private partnerships; or providing 
financial assistance under existing programs.
    Section 4, which is the only section of the bill that is specific 
to the National Park Service, would require superintendents of national 
parks to conduct public meetings, consult local stakeholders, and 
provide a 60-day public comment period for any action that would reduce 
access to a park for a reason not connected to a specific emergency-
type incident. Because the National Park Service currently conducts 
public outreach and solicits public comments for access-related actions 
at parks such as establishing reservation systems, the Department would 
like to better understand the purpose of this provision and to work 
with the sponsor and the Committee to clarify it accordingly.
    Section 5 would require the Secretaries of Agriculture and the 
Interior to establish a single visitation data reporting system to 
report annual visitation data across all the units of Federal 
recreational lands and on land held in trust for Indian Tribes, if 
requested by a Tribe. The data would include estimates for multiple 
categories of recreation activities. This section would also require 
the establishment of a ``Real-time Data Pilot Program'' that would make 
available to the public data on visitation at: selected Federal land 
management units; other Federal, State, and local recreation sites near 
the selected units; and other lesser-known recreation sites near the 
selected units, in an effort to encourage visitation among recreation 
sites. In selecting the Federal land management units to participate in 
the pilot program, the Secretaries would be directed to solicit 
feedback from gateway communities. The pilot program would consist of 
15 units managed by land management bureaus of the Department and five 
by the U.S. Forest Service; within five years, the program is to 
include 80 additional sites, 50 of which would be managed by the 
Department's bureaus.
    Section 6 of the bill would require the Secretaries of Agriculture 
and the Interior, by January 1, 2024, to establish a digital version of 
the National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass that can be 
stored on a mobile device and make that pass available to pass 
purchasers. The National Park Service, on behalf of all participating 
Interagency Pass Program agencies, has been actively working on 
establishing digital passes at individual sites as an option for 
visitors since it launched a pilot in the fall/winter of 2016/2017. 
Digital site-specific passes are currently offered at over 80 NPS 
locations as well as other agency locations.
    The Department appreciates the intent of this bill and is broadly 
supportive of congressional efforts to provide the various Federal land 
management agencies under its jurisdiction with greater authorities and 
flexibility to respond, based on the best available data and evidence, 
to changing needs and evolving challenges in a time of increased 
visitation to our public lands. We would welcome the opportunity to 
continue collaborating with the bill sponsors and the Committee to 
advance these goals.
H.R. 4984, The D.C. Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus 
        Revitalization Act

    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to provide the Department 
of the Interior's views on H.R. 4984, the D.C. Robert F. Kennedy 
Memorial Stadium Campus Revitalization Act.
    The Department supports the goals of H.R. 4984. Our principal 
interest is in ensuring that the legislation provides sufficient 
protection for park and recreational areas within the area that the 
National Park Service (NPS) has long been responsible for 
administering, directly or through a lease, in the part of the District 
of Columbia (District) where the former stadium and adjacent parklands 
are located. The Department defers to the General Services 
Administration (GSA) for its views on the aspects of the legislation 
that pertain to that agency.
    H.R. 4984 would amend the District of Columbia Stadium Act of 1957 
to direct the Secretary of the Interior to transfer administrative 
jurisdiction of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus (Campus) 
to the Administrator of the GSA. The GSA would assume the NPS's 
responsibilities under the Federal government's current lease with the 
District. The legislation would direct the development of a new 99-year 
lease between the GSA and the District that would permit a number of 
uses, including a stadium and commercial and residential development, 
subject to the approval of the National Capital Planning Commission and 
the Commission of Fine Arts.
    Importantly from our perspective, H.R. 4984 would require that, as 
a condition of using the Campus for commercial and residential 
development, the lease would require that the District ensure that the 
development does not materially degrade or adversely impact any lands 
under the jurisdiction of the NPS; that 30 percent of the land be 
designated as parks and open space; and that development provides for 
public access to the Anacostia River and shall not interrupt the 
Anacostia River Trail. These requirements would help preserve the 
Federal government's historic commitment to maintaining significant 
portions of land in this part of the District as park and recreational 
space.
    The Campus sits on land administered by the NPS as part of 
Anacostia Park. Originally envisioned by the 1901 McMillan Commission 
as public gardens and recreation space, Anacostia Park was established 
in 1918 when Congress directed the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge 
the Anacostia River flats and use the fill to create new parkland. In 
1924, Congress established what would eventually become the National 
Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) which directed the management of 
Anacostia Park as part of the park, parkway, and playground system of 
the Nation's capital. In 1933, Executive Order 6166 transferred NCPC's 
responsibilities for management of the park, parkway, and playground 
system, including Anacostia Park, to the NPS.
    The District of Columbia Stadium Act of 1957 previously called for 
transferring the entire Campus to the District following the repayment 
of the costs to construct the stadium. However, the Campus remained the 
property of the Federal government. As amended in 1986, the act 
directed the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to convey ownership 
of the stadium building, only, to the District and establish a 50-year 
conditional lease for the stadium grounds and surrounding parking. The 
1986 amendments required that the property be used for the purposes of 
recreation facilities, open space, and public outdoor recreation 
facilities in addition to a stadium. The lease entered into between the 
NPS and the District in 1968, pursuant to the 1986 amendments, is set 
to expire in 2038.
    The lease area is approximately 142 acres, including the 11 acres 
that were occupied by the District-owned former stadium structure. 
Under the current law, if the leased property were no longer used for 
the purposes allowed by the 1986 amendments and under the lease, the 
lands would revert to the Secretary to be administered as part of 
Anacostia Park and the District would bear the costs of removing 
structures, or rehabilitating the stadium or land, as the Secretary 
determines appropriate.
    The District currently manages approximately 851 acres of parkland 
across the city and the leasing of land as directed in H.R. 4984 would 
present an opportunity for the District to add to those lands and 
improve its park system. The bill's additional permitted uses 
(commercial and residential development) would allow the District to 
implement its plan to transform the Campus from acres of asphalt to a 
complex focused on community sports, recreation, park space and 
cultural amenities. The bill's requirement that 30 percent of the land 
be designated for parks and open space as a condition for residential 
and commercial development would guarantee public access to a sizable 
amount of park land and outdoor recreation areas.
    Additionally, the bill's parks and open space requirements would 
complement NPS park land in the immediate vicinity. Of particular note, 
within the vicinity is a 32-acre riparian buffer which contains a 
portion of the Anacostia River Trail and serves as a critical 
transition from the 142 acres of leased lands to the Anacostia River. 
This transition zone protects the river from runoff that would 
otherwise carry sediments and pollutants into the water. It is critical 
to ensure that this area is maintained as a riparian buffer.
    The Department would like to recommend some amendments to the bill 
as drafted and looks forward to working with Congress. Furthermore, 
because there are three House committees reviewing this bill and many 
more steps ahead in the legislative process, we would ask for your 
support as the bill advances to ensure that it continues to provide for 
the protection of a sufficient amount of land for open space, park and 
recreation purposes, consistent with the Federal government's historic 
commitment to that goal. We look forward to working with you toward 
that end.

    Chairman Tiffany, this concludes my statement. I would be happy to 
answer any questions you or other members of the Subcommittee may have.

                                 ______

    Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Deputy Director Reynolds.
    I would like to introduce Ms. Jacqueline Emanuel, the 
Associate Deputy Chief of the National Forest Service.
    Associate Deputy Chief Emanuel, you are recognized for 5 
minutes.

   STATEMENT OF JACQUELINE EMANUEL, ASSOCIATE DEPUTY CHIEF, 
  NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM, U.S. FOREST SERVICE, WASHINGTON, DC

    Ms. Emanuel. Chairman Tiffany, thank you very much for the 
invitation to testify today. I am Jacqueline Emanuel, Associate 
Deputy Chief for the National Forest System for the USDA Forest 
Service.
    My work in the National Forest System includes policy 
oversight and direction for recreation management, which is the 
subject of two bills you are considering today. Our recreation 
program provides a wide array of recreational opportunities on 
our public land, including 159,000 miles of trails, 370,000 
miles of roads, and nearly 30,000 recreation sites. In fact, 
our recreation program is the primary pathway that more than 
160 million visitors used to connect with their national 
forests last year alone.
    Recreation is the largest economic driver of the national 
forest, contributing more than $13.7 billion to America's GDP 
and supporting more than 161,000 jobs. Gateway communities play 
an important role in creating and sustaining this recreation 
economy.
    At the Forest Service, we see a strong need to engage 
across boundaries in more comprehensive recreation planning 
with gateway communities and other stakeholders to identify 
sustainable solutions to the growing demand for outdoor 
recreation on Federal and other public lands.
    As we reimagine recreation, we are challenging ourselves to 
think differently about how we deliver recreation into the 
future. Our vision is grounded in engagement with others, 
including new and diverse audiences such as our gateway 
communities.
    Regarding the bills being discussed today, H.R. 3200, the 
Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement Act, aims to 
enhance recreation opportunities for gateway communities and to 
provide digital versions of the National Parks and Federal 
Recreation Lands Passes. USDA supports the goals of this bill. 
We would welcome an opportunity to work with the Subcommittee 
and bill sponsors to improve upon the current legislation in 
support of these goals.
    USDA supports H.R. 3107, the Improving Outdoor Recreation 
Coordination Act. This bill would codify the Federal 
Interagency Council on Recreation, or FICOR. USDA is a charter 
member of FICOR, an organization which has proven itself 
instrumental in forwarding interagency initiatives in support 
of outdoor recreation.
    USDA supports the goals of H.R. 1657, Lake Winnibigoshish 
Land Exchange Act of 2023. This bill would direct the Forest 
Service to exchange approximately 13.8 acres of Federal land 
located in the Chippewa National Forest for approximately 38 
acres of non-Federal land in Itasca County, Minnesota. We would 
like to work with the Subcommittee and bill sponsor on 
technical improvements to the bill to address our concern with 
the land exchange timeline.
    We appreciate the Subcommittee's focus on improving 
recreation management on public lands and in our neighboring 
gateway communities. We also appreciate your interest in a 
proposed land exchange that enjoys local support. We look 
forward to working with you. Thank you.

    [The prepared statement of Ms. Emanuel follows:]
   Prepared Statement of Jacqueline Emanuel, Associate Deputy Chief, 
 National Forest System, U.S. Department of Agriculture--Forest Service
                 on H.R. 1657, H.R. 3107, and H.R. 3200

    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service, regarding 
various Federal land management bills. USDA defers to the U.S. 
Department of the Interior (DOI) as to the effects of these bills on 
any DOI bureaus and the federal lands under their jurisdiction.
Background

    The USDA Forest Service manages 155 national forests and 20 
national grasslands, comprising 193 million acres in 41 states and 
Puerto Rico. National forest and grassland outdoor recreation offers 
the widest possible array of opportunities to experience Federal lands, 
which are home to three million acres of lakes, 400,000 miles of 
streams, 122 Wild and Scenic Rivers for rafting, kayaking and other 
watersports, and 159,000 miles of trails for horseback riding, hiking, 
snowmobiling, mountain biking, hunting, and more.
    The Forest Service is deeply committed to connecting all Americans 
to the outdoors, and we value the important role played by outfitters 
and guides, resorts, non-profit organizations, and other concessioners 
in connecting people to recreation opportunities in the national 
forests and grasslands. Outdoor recreation attracts people to visit, 
live, and work in gateway and rural communities and supports the 
health, well-being, and economic vitality of those communities. In 
fiscal year 2021, recreation on National Forest System (NFS) lands 
contributed more than $13.7 billion to America's gross domestic product 
and supported more than 161,500 full and part-time jobs, the vast 
majority of which are in gateway and rural communities.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ 2021 National Visitor Use Monitoring survey. These numbers 
reflect total benefits (direct, indirect, and induced).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In fiscal year 2021, there were 156 million recreation visits to 
national forests and grasslands. When we include the number of people 
who pass through these beautiful forests and grasslands to enjoy the 
scenery and travel on scenic roads and byways, that number increases to 
456 million visits. Recreation pressure has been particularly 
significant in national forests close to urban areas.
    Moreover, the recreation program on NFS lands sustains more private 
sector jobs per program dollar than any other Forest Service program 
and provides the single largest economic stimulus for many local 
communities adjacent to or within NFS boundaries. Outdoor recreation 
opportunities and amenities are consistently ranked as one of the 
primary reasons people move to rural towns and can be a leading 
contributor to small town economies. The Forest Service administers 
over 30,000 commercial recreation special use authorizations for 
activities that generate nearly $2 billion in revenue for special use 
authorization holders. In particular, the Forest Service administers 
127 ski area permits and approximately 8,000 outfitting and guiding 
permits.
    USDA appreciates the recognition by this Subcommittee of the 
importance of recreation on Federal lands to our national economy, as 
well as the sustained interest in finding solutions to recreation 
management challenges. We understand these challenges, and we know that 
we can further enhance recreation opportunities on Federal lands. 
Seeking to continue the momentum built through the Great America 
Outdoors Act and the Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), 
the Forest Service has initiated a national strategy and action plan 
called Reimagine Recreation. The Forest Service is also a foundational 
member of Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation (FICOR), 
which is partnering across all land and water management agencies to 
better coordinate delivery of opportunities and access for outdoor 
recreation. This effort will clarify and change the way we deliver 
recreation opportunities. We are building our vision by engaging with 
new and diverse audiences.
H.R. 3200--Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement Act

    H.R. 3200, the ``Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement 
Act,'' requires the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the 
Interior to carry out certain activities to enhance recreational 
opportunities for gateway communities. The bill also amends the Federal 
Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) to provide for the 
establishment of a digital National Parks and Federal Recreational 
Lands Pass.
    Section 3 seeks to enhance understanding of the economic impacts of 
visitation on gateway communities and to identify the needs of those 
communities, such as housing and other infrastructure necessary to 
accommodate and manage growing levels of visitation. The bill would 
require the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to seek to meet 
the identified needs through a variety of mechanisms under existing 
law, such as financial assistance, cooperative agreements, and public-
private partnerships.
    However, Section 3 also includes the provision that USDA can 
provide financial or technical assistance to a gateway community under 
an existing program to remedy any identified economic needs, such as 
housing shortages and to address demands on existing municipal 
infrastructure. The Forest Service lacks authority to provide direct 
economic development assistance in gateway or rural communities. 
Authority for this function rests in USDA-Rural Development. Forest 
Service initiatives in the recreation economy space are linked to 
program authorities. Because the Forest Service lacks any authority to 
provide financial assistance beyond NFS boundaries, this bill would 
need to give that authority to the Secretary of Agriculture.
    Section 4 of H.R. 3200 requires the National Park Service (NPS) to 
conduct certain procedures before taking any action that will reduce 
access to a National Park. USDA defers to the Department of the 
Interior on any impacts on NPS related to this provision.
    Section 5(a) of this bill would require the Secretaries to 
establish a single visitation data reporting system to report annual 
visitation data in a consistent manner. Section 5(b) of this bill would 
require USDA to select five national forests for a pilot program to 
make visitation data available to the public, including data and 
resources publicly available from existing nongovernmental platforms. 
The bill would allow the data to be provided directly by the agency or 
indirectly through its partners. Within five years of enactment, the 
Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior would be required to select 
an additional 80 units for this program. Section 5 also would require 
the Secretaries to share information about lesser-known recreation 
sites through a variety of media platforms to disperse visitation among 
recreation sites.
    The Forest Service currently collects visitor use data and monitors 
trends in visitor use annually through the National Visitor Use 
Monitoring program and makes visitation data publicly available on its 
website. To the extent this bill would require the agency to provide 
real-time visitor use data to the public, the agency would like to work 
with the bill sponsor to address technical concerns. USDA would like to 
work with the Subcommittee and bill sponsors to better understand the 
visitation data requirements in Section 5 and to make technical 
improvements to the bill.
    Section 6 of this bill would amend existing legislation under the 
Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act and would require the 
establishment of digital versions of the America the Beautiful--
National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands passes no later than 
January 1, 2024. Due to technical requirements and the time needed to 
implement the conversion to digital passes, we recommend amending this 
deadline to January 1, 2026, to allow sufficient time to implement this 
change responsibly and effectively.
    USDA recognizes the important role and needs of gateway communities 
in sustaining the recreation economy. We are helping to invest in 
community well-being, expand the outdoor recreation economy, and 
provide access to the outdoors for underserved populations. We have 
partnered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the 
Northern Border Regional Commission to launch the Recreation Economy 
for Rural Communities program, which provides planning assistance to 
help rural communities leverage outdoor recreation as an economic 
development strategy. USDA Forest Service, Rural Development, and the 
National Institute for Food and Agriculture are also collaborating to 
support the recreation economies of rural forest gateway communities by 
providing technical expertise and funding to develop recreation 
infrastructure and capacity beyond the boundaries of NFS lands. We have 
identified a strong need to engage across boundaries in more 
comprehensive recreation planning to identify sustainable solutions to 
the growing demand for outdoor recreation on Federal and other public 
lands. Collaborative, all-lands recreation planning is at the heart of 
our Reimagine Recreation effort.
    USDA supports the goals of H.R. 3200 to enhance recreation 
opportunities for gateway communities and to provide digital versions 
of the America the Beautiful--National Parks and Federal Recreational 
Lands passes. We would welcome an opportunity to work with the 
Subcommittee and bill sponsors to improve upon the current legislation 
in support of these goals.
H.R. 3107--Improving Outdoor Recreation Coordination Act

    H.R. 3107 legislatively establishes an interagency council known as 
the Federal Interagency Council on Recreation (FICOR), composed of 
representatives from the National Park Service, Bureau of Land 
Management, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, Bureau of Reclamation, Forest Service, United States Army 
Corps of Engineers, and the National Marine Fisheries Service. Among 
other purposes, the bill would charge FICOR with coordination of 
recreation management policies across Federal agencies, including 
implementation of the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (16 
U.S.C. 6801 et seq.).
    On July 20, 2022, the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, and the 
Interior and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works signed 
a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that re-established FICOR 
administratively, with the purpose of creating more safe, affordable, 
and equitable opportunities for Americans to get outdoors. This MOU 
renewed and re-energized FICOR, which was originally created 
administratively in 2011 but was suspended by the previous 
administration. FICOR provides a focus on improving access to nature, 
expanding outdoor recreation opportunities, and providing the public 
with improved and more affordable experiences on America's public lands 
and waters.
    FICOR has been instrumental in forwarding interagency initiatives 
promoting youth outdoor activities and policy and data coordination in 
support of outdoor recreation. The USDA Forest Service is a charter 
member of FICOR and supports H.R. 3107, which would codify FICOR in 
statute.
H.R. 1657--Lake Winnibigoshish Land Exchange Act of 2023

    H.R. 1657 would direct the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest 
Service to exchange approximately 13.8 acres of Federal land in Itasca 
County, Minnesota located in the Chippewa National Forest within the 
Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe Reservation boundary for approximately 38 
acres of non-Federal land in Itasca County, Minnesota, which is owned 
by Big Winnie Land and Timber, LLC, (BWLT). Subject to the provisions 
of this Act, if BWLT offers to convey the non-Federal land to the 
United States, the Secretary shall, not later than 180 days after 
receiving the offer (1) accept the offer, (2) convey to BWLT all right, 
title, and interest of the United States in and to the federal land; 
and (3) accept from BWLT all right, title, and interest of BWLT in and 
to the non-federal land. The exchange would be for equal value, or the 
values shall be equalized by a cash payment, subject to an exception. 
The land acquired by USDA would be added to and managed as part of 
Chippewa National Forest.
    USDA supports the goals of H.R. 1657, ``Lake Winnibigoshish Land 
Exchange Act of 2023.'' The bill would extend benefits to the public by 
exchanging developed shoreline for a larger, undeveloped parcel in 
which the Forest Service would no longer need to administer a special 
use permit. While we are supportive of the bill, the Department has 
concerns with the 180-day time frame allotted to complete the exchange. 
We would welcome the opportunity to work with the Subcommittee and the 
bill sponsor to refine this language and make other technical 
refinements to meet the bill's intent.

    That concludes my testimony. Thank you for the opportunity to 
testify. I am happy to answer any questions the Subcommittee may have 
for me.

Questions Submitted for the Record to Ms. Jacqueline Emanuel, Associate 
       Deputy Chief, National Forest System, U.S. Forest Service

             Questions Submitted by Representative Tiffany

    Question 1. During the hearing, you mentioned the Forest Service 
coordinates with local, county, and state governments 
(``stakeholders'').

    1a) How does the Forest Service define coordination?

    Answer. The type of coordination with stakeholders conducted by the 
Forest Service varies depending on the context and applicable legal 
requirements, as discussed in response to Question 1b.

    1b) Will you provide citations for laws, statutes, codes, 
regulations, and policy manuals directing the Forest Service to 
coordinate with stakeholders?

    Answer. Several authorities provide for Forest Service coordination 
with stakeholders. Examples include, but are not limited to, the 
following:

    <bullet> Section 14(a) of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable 
            Resources Planning Act of 1974, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 1612(a), and 
            its implementing regulations at 36 C.F.R. Part 216, require 
            the Forest Service to provide notice and opportunity to 
            comment on formulation of standards, criteria, and 
            guidelines applicable to Forest Service programs. Forest 
            Service directives implementing these authorities state 
            that it is the policy of the Forest Service to ensure 
            appropriate intergovernmental communication when developing 
            or amending directives that are subject to public notice 
            and comment. Forest Service Handbook (FSH) 1109.12, Ch. 30, 
            sec. 34.

    <bullet> Forest Service regulations at 36 C.F.R. Part 212, Subparts 
            A and B, require the agency to coordinate with stakeholders 
            when designating National Forest System (NFS) roads, NFS 
            trails, and areas on NFS lands for motor vehicle or over-
            snow vehicle use.

    <bullet> The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and 
            Recreation Act of 2019, Pub. L. No. 116-9, Title IV 
            (Sportsmen's Access and Related Matters) (Dingell Act), 
            requires the Forest Service to coordinate with stakeholders 
            on proposed temporary and permanent restrictions and 
            prohibitions on hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting 
            on NFS lands. Forest Service directives implementing this 
            requirement are in FSH 5309.11, Chapter 30, section 34.

    <bullet> Forest Service regulations at 36 C.F.R. Part 261, Subpart 
            C, provide for public notice and opportunity to comment on 
            permanent restrictions and prohibitions applicable to a 
            Forest Service region.

    <bullet> The Forest Service engages with stakeholders and other 
            members of the public on proposals to establish, modify, or 
            eliminate a recreation fee consistent with section 804 of 
            the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA), 16 
            U.S.C. Sec. 6803, and Forest Service directives at FSH 
            2309.13, Chapter 30, section 32.8.

    <bullet> The Forest Service also engages with stakeholders and 
            other members of the public in connection with National 
            Environmental Policy Act compliance for proposed projects, 
            including decommissioning of developed recreation sites 
            pursuant to recreation site assessments.

    Question 2. H.R. 3200 would require the National Park Service to 
coordinate with local stakeholders, hold public meetings, and open at 
least a 60-day comment period before any action is taken to reduce 
access. Does the Forest Service support including similar requirements 
before reducing access to National Forest System lands?

    Answer. Because the Forest Service generally conducts public 
outreach and solicits public comments for access-related actions needed 
on NFS lands, we would like to better understand the purpose of this 
provision and to work with the sponsor and the Committee to clarify it 
accordingly. The provision as drafted would preclude the agency from 
timely issuing short-term orders to address immediate public health and 
safety or resource concerns in specific areas, as authorized by the 
Dingell Act (authorizing emergency orders without public notice and 
comment) and the agency's travel management regulations at 36 C.F.R. 
Sec. 212.52(b)(1) and (b)(2) (authorizing temporary, emergency closures 
and temporary, emergency closures based on determination of 
considerable adverse effects without public involvement).
    Question 3. Earlier this year during another hearing focused on 
recreation, the Forest Service followed up and assured me there are 
plans and funding available to rehabilitate boat launches at Beaver 
Lake, Cisco Lake, Stock Farm, Twin Lake, and Mondeaux. Will you provide 
an update on the status of these boat launches?

    Answer. The Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest remains on schedule 
for the planned rehabilitation at Beaver Lake, Cisco Lake, Twin Lakes, 
Stock Farm, and Mondeaux Flowage using funding under the Great American 
Outdoors Act. The boat landing rehabilitations for Beaver Lake, Cisco 
Lake, Twin Lakes, and Stock Farm are anticipated to be completed in 
fiscal year (FY) 2024. Additionally, the planned fishing pier 
rehabilitation or replacement at Mondeaux Flowage is anticipated to be 
completed in FY 2025. The fishing ramp will remain open during 
rehabilitation or replacement of the fishing pier at Mondeaux Flowage.

    Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Associate Deputy Chief Emanuel.
    I now recognize Mr. Cory Smith, District 1 Commissioner for 
Itasca County in Minnesota.
    Commissioner Smith, you have 5 minutes.

   STATEMENT OF CORY SMITH, COMMISSIONER, DISTRICT 1, ITASCA 
                       COUNTY, MINNESOTA

    Mr. Smith. Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and 
members of the Subcommittee, thank you for allowing me the 
opportunity to testify today. My name is Cory Smith. I serve as 
County Commissioner representing the citizens of Itasca County 
in northern Minnesota, home of the Chippewa National Forest and 
Lake Winnibigoshish.
    I want to thank Representative Stauber for introducing H.R. 
1657, the Lake Winnibigoshish Land Exchange Act of 2023, along 
with Ranking Member Neguse and Representative Huffman for their 
co-sponsorship of this bill.
    The land exchange bill would transfer 13.8 acres along Lake 
Winnibigoshish to the owners of Bowen Lodge, which is a 
fishing-hunting resort that has played an important role in our 
community since 1982. The transfer will ensure 1,640 feet of 
shoreline and permanent access to the lake for recreation. In 
return, Bowen Lodge would transfer 38 acres of land to the U.S. 
Forest Service to be added to the Chippewa National Forest. 
Transferring this acreage to the Chippewa National Forest will 
allow greater management of land and ensure the public has the 
best access to recreate and enjoy our beautiful natural 
resources.
    Bowen Lodge is a third-generation, family-owned resort 
dating back to 1925. The Heig family, which operates the Lodge 
today, and have done so for over 40 years. Over those three 
generations, this family continues to be stewards of the land. 
From their state-of-the-art septic systems to their shoreline 
improvements, they have taken strides to protect the health of 
Lake Winnibigoshish and the landscape around them. Bowen Lodge 
has had an impact on so many other resorts on the lake, as 
well, and that is one of the reasons that Lake Winnibigoshish 
continues to thrive.
    On a local level, there is nothing but support for this 
land exchange. As a community leader, I would like to again 
express that the Heig family and Bowen Lodge has gone above and 
beyond for all Minnesotans when it comes to taking care of Lake 
Winnibigoshish and the Chippewa National Forest that surrounds 
them.
    Not only an elected official in Itasca County, but also as 
a local resident that is raising my family and a growing 
business in the area, I feel the time is now to complete this 
land exchange. This is an absolute win-win for everyone.
    I thank you again for the opportunity to testify on this 
bill today, which I firmly believe will benefit the citizens of 
Itasca County and ensure greater access to countless 
Minnesotans who seek to recreate along Lake Winnibigoshish.
    I look forward to answering any of your questions.

    Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Commissioner Smith.
    I now recognize Mr. Randy Brodehl, Commissioner for 
Flathead County in Kalispell, Montana.
    Commissioner Brodehl, you have 5 minutes.

  STATEMENT OF RANDY BRODEHL, COMMISSIONER, FLATHEAD COUNTY, 
                       KALISPELL, MONTANA

    Mr. Brodehl. Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, thank 
you very much for holding this hearing to discuss legislation 
to support gateway communities and enhance recreation in our 
public lands. My name is Randy Brodehl, and I am a Flathead 
County, Montana Commissioner. I previously served in the 
Montana House of Representatives and as a local fire chief, and 
I offer my testimony today on behalf of the National 
Association of Counties.
    Flathead County is in northwest Montana, and has a 
population of 120,000 people. We are a gateway to three 
national forests, a national wildlife refuge, the Pacific 
Northwest National Scenic Trail, two national wildernesses, and 
Glacier National Park. Recreational access to these Federal 
lands is our primary economic driver.
    Visitations to Federal lands have exploded in recent years. 
Glacier National Park has seen approximately 3 million visitors 
annually since 2017, apart from when it was closed for COVID. 
While this has led to a rapid economic growth in our gateway 
community, there are significant drawbacks to our population 
increasing several times our number of residents for a few 
months out of every year.
    Three years ago, Glacier National Park implemented a 
reservation permit system for Going-to-the-Sun Road. And Going-
to-the-Sun Road is the only road that goes all the way through 
the park. This reduced visitation by about a half a million 
people in 2022. This year the park requires permits for all 
vehicles, likely further reducing visitation levels.
    When the Federal Government pushes down on our gateway 
communities, we can suffer millions of dollars in economic 
loss. H.R. 3200, the Gateway Community and Recreation 
Enhancement Act, requires Federal land agencies to conduct 
public meetings, consult local stakeholders, and allow for 
public comment. Counties appreciate Congressman Ryan Zinke and 
Senator Steve Daines for introducing this bipartisan 
legislation.
    When visitors cannot acquire a park entry permit, they 
recreate in our gateway communities. Flathead Lake is a massive 
tourism draw. Unfortunately, for the first time in 50 years, 
the Bureau of Reclamation did not release enough water to keep 
Flathead Lake at full capacity, exposing the lake bottom, 
closing marinas, stranding boats, and exposing irrigation pump 
intakes.
    With access to Glacier National Park and Flathead Lake 
curtailed, our visitor numbers faded, doing significant harm to 
our economy. Without the Gateway Community and Recreation 
Enhancement Act we are destined to repeat this devastating 
action every year because county and state officials do not 
have a seat at the Federal decision-making table.
    Flathead County's access to U.S. Forest Service lands, 
wilderness areas, and national wildlife refuge lands has 
remained virtually the same for the past 60 years, while 
tourism numbers have quadrupled. The Gateway Community and 
Recreation Enhancement Act will support expansion of recreation 
enhancements in our gateway communities by considering more 
option actions like adding campgrounds, opening roads in our 
forests, trails in our wilderness areas, and greater access to 
our wildlife refuge, and also educating our visitors about 
options in gateway communities.
    For us in the Flathead, the Act will let us help with best 
practice decisions. H.R. 3200 would ensure the public has 
access to their lands, and it lessens the burden of increased 
visitations on communities. The bill requires the U.S. 
Department of the Interior to collaborate with counties, 
states, tribes, and various stakeholders to identify the needs 
of gateway communities in affordable housing, infrastructure, 
maintenance, and visitor accommodations.
    The Department could provide technical or financial 
assistance, issue leases or rights-of-way, and special use 
permits to meet our community needs.
    Additionally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture would also 
be allowed to provide similar assistance to businesses like 
hotels, campgrounds, and restaurants. These new authorities 
will create the crucial partnerships that bring visitors back 
to Federal lands and sustainability growth in gateway community 
economies.
    H.R. 3200 would create a digital version of the America the 
Beautiful Public Lands Pass so visitors can more easily access 
Federal lands of all kinds. This will reduce wait times at 
visitor centers and entry gates.
    The bill would also establish a pilot program, in 
consultation with gateway communities, to provide real-time 
visitation data and help to drive people to lesser-known 
recreation sites, which will also reduce wait times and 
decrease the pressure on the most visited Federal lands.
    Thank you for the opportunity to tell Flathead County's 
story. Counties urge Congress to adopt H.R. 3200 expeditiously, 
and I look forward to your questions. Thank you.

                              on H.R. 3200

    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse and members of the U.S. 
House Committee on Natural Resources Subcommittee on Federal Lands, 
thank you for holding this hearing to discuss legislation to support 
gateway communities and enhance recreation on public lands.
    My name is Randy Brodehl, and I have been a Flathead County, 
Montana Commissioner since 2019. I previously served in the Montana 
House of Representatives and as Chief of the Kalispell, Montana Fire 
Department. I offer my testimony today on behalf of the National 
Association of Counties (NACo).
    Flathead County is located in northwest Montana on the border with 
Canada. We have a population of 120,000 people and serve as a gateway 
to three national forests, a national wildlife refuge, the Pacific 
Northwest National Scenic Trail, two national wildernesses, and Glacier 
National Park. Recreational access to these federal lands is the 
primary economic driver in Flathead County.
Impacts of increased visitation to gateway communities

    Visitations to federal lands have exploded in recent years. Glacier 
National Park alone has seen approximately three million visitors 
annually since 2017, apart from 2020, when the Park was temporarily 
closed due to the covid pandemic. While this has led to needed, rapid 
economic growth in Flathead County, there are significant drawbacks to 
our population increasing to several times our number of residents for 
a few months out of the year.
    Three years ago, Glacier National Park, under direction of the U.S. 
Department of the Interior, implemented a reservation permit system for 
the Going-to-the-Sun Road, the only road that goes all the way through 
the Park. This reduced visitation by half a million people in 2022. 
This year the Park chose to further restrict visitation by requiring 
permits for vehicles coming into every entrance of the Park. While the 
numbers impacted are not yet available, it will be significant and 
likely more than last year. The financial impacts are not felt by the 
National Park Service but are an incredible loss to our communities 
where tourism is king. Park Superintendents do not respond to the needs 
of gateway communities, so losses attributed to decisions made by the 
National Park Service are ignored.
    Like the rest of the counties surrounding national parks, we are a 
tourism-based community, so when the federal government pushes down on 
our gateway communities, we can suffer millions of dollars in economic 
losses. H.R. 3200, the Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement 
Act, is in response to this and requires Superintendents of affected 
national parks to conduct public meetings, consult local stakeholders, 
and allow for public comment.
    When visitors are not lucky enough to get one of the coveted park 
entry permits, it is typical for them to spend time and tourism dollars 
recreating in our gateway communities. Flathead Lake, the largest 
freshwater lake west of the Mississippi, is a massive tourism draw. An 
unanticipated domino effect to the Park's ticketing system became 
exceedingly apparent this year and left our community reeling when the 
Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) changed Flathead Lake water level policy 
without consideration of the impacts to the economies of lake 
communities. The Bureau chose to not release enough water to keep 
Flathead Lake at full capacity, letting it drop 30 inches by mid-
summer, exposing the lake bottom and closing marinas, stranding boats, 
and exposing irrigation pump intakes. This is something they have never 
done in the 50 years they have been managing the lake level by release 
of reservoir waters above the lake. With federal lands and water access 
being curtailed, our visitor numbers faded, doing significant harm to 
our economy, and discouraging future tourism. All of this was done 
without seeking public or local government input. Without the Gateway 
Community and Recreation Enhancement Act, we are destined to repeat 
this devasting action every year because county and state officials do 
not have a seat at the federal decision-making table.
    Flathead County's access to U.S. Forest Service lands, wilderness 
areas, and National Wildlife Refuge lands has remained virtually the 
same for the past 60 years, while tourism due to our local federal 
lands' attractions have quadrupled. The Gateway Community and 
Recreation Enhancement Act will support expansion of recreational 
enhancements in our gateway communities by considering more options and 
actions like maintaining water levels, adding campgrounds, opening 
roads in our forests, trails in our wilderness areas, greater access to 
our wildlife refuge, and educating our visitors about more options in 
gateway communities. The Act will give counties a seat at the table and 
let us help with best practice decisions.
H.R. 3200, The Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement Act

    Congress should ensure the public has access to their lands and 
partner with counties and stakeholders to lessen the burden of 
increased visitations on communities. H.R. 3200 would help meet these 
goals. Counties appreciate Congressman Ryan Zinke and Senator Steve 
Daines for introducing this bipartisan legislation and encourage 
Congress to swiftly pass it to provide needed support to federal lands 
gateway counties throughout the country, especially in the West.
    First, the bill requires the U.S. Department of the Interior to 
collaborate with counties, states, Tribes and various stakeholders to 
identify the needs of gateway communities in affordable housing, 
infrastructure maintenance and visitor accommodations. The Department 
would be allowed to provide technical or financial assistance, issue 
leases or rights-of-way and special use permits to meet community needs 
in these areas. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture would 
be allowed to provide similar assistance to businesses like hotels, 
campgrounds and restaurants. These new authorities will create the 
crucial partnerships that bring visitors back to federal lands and grow 
the economies of gateway communities in a sustainable manner.
    H.R. 3200 would create a digital version of the America the 
Beautiful public lands pass so visitors can more easily access federal 
lands of all kinds. This will help to reduce wait times at visitor 
centers and entry gates, including during the summer tourist season. 
The bill would also establish a pilot program in consultation with 
gateway communities to provide real-time visitation data and help to 
drive people to lesser-known recreation sites, which will also reduce 
wait times and decrease the pressure on the most visited places in our 
public lands system, like Glacier National Park.
Conclusion
    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse and members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to tell Flathead County's 
story. Counties urge Congress to enact policies to help gateway 
communities adjust to the rapid increase in visitations to federal 
lands. We urge Congress to adopt H.R. 3200 expeditiously. I look 
forward to your questions.

for the Outdoor Recreation Round Table.
    Ma'am, you have 5 minutes.

 STATEMENT OF AMBREEN TARIQ, SENIOR PROGRAM DIRECTOR, OUTDOOR 
             RECREATION ROUNDTABLE, WASHINGTON, DC

    Ms. Tariq. Good afternoon, Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member 
Neguse, and members of the Committee. On behalf of the Outdoor 
Recreation Roundtable, thank you for having me here today.
    Our industry is in strong support of several important 
recreation provisions, including the Improving Outdoor 
Recreation Coordination Act and the Gateway Community and 
Recreation Enhancement Act.
    I would also like to thank the sponsors of these bipartisan 
bills: Representatives Zinke, Peltola, Neguse, Lawler, and 
Moore, whose leadership will help strengthen coordination and 
focus on the recreation economy for Federal agencies and rural 
communities.
    ORR is the nation's leading coalition of outdoor recreation 
associations, representing more than 110,000 businesses in the 
industry. According to the Department of Commerce, outdoor 
recreation generated $862 billion and 4.5 million American jobs 
in 2021. That is 2 percent of our GDP and 3 percent of all U.S. 
employees. Our industry's growth rate tripled that of the 
national economy from 2020 to 2021, as we saw people flocking 
outdoors to benefit for their mental and physical health, 
quality of life, and strengthening rural economies.
    In my role as Senior Program Director, I work on issues of 
workforce, access, and economic development related to outdoor 
recreation. I also coordinate Together Outdoors, a coalition 
aimed at making the outdoors more welcoming and inclusive for 
all through business engagement and partnerships.
    My family and I moved to the United States when I was 
young, actually to Minnesota, and we somehow stumbled into the 
outdoors, where we surprisingly found refuge through stressful 
immigrant lives, and that is why I am passionate about 
advocating for outdoor recreation so that everybody's American 
dream can include access and benefits from the outdoors.
    The bills we are discussing today are about Federal 
Government working better for businesses, states, and the 
American people so we can have a better return on investment 
for taxpayer dollars and create the best policies for 
industry's biggest opportunities and challenges. Whether it is 
a motorcycle dealership in Wisconsin, a ski resort in Colorado, 
or a family-owned outfitter by a national park, recreation 
businesses need certainty to make investments in their 
employees and better serve their customers.
    Both bills provide this much-needed certainty through good 
government collaboration and helpful tools for main street 
businesses and rural communities.
    There are many agencies whose work impacts outdoor 
recreation. Coordination through the Federal Interagency 
Council on Outdoor Recreation can help break down government 
silos to resolve multi-jurisdictional challenges and improve 
efficiencies. Institutionalizing FICOR will also help agencies 
better collaborate around important issues like how to welcome 
more people outdoors, including diverse and under-represented 
communities. As outdoor recreation continues to grow, this 
level of coordination is necessary to ensure agencies are 
aligned internally and to streamline engagement externally for 
industry stakeholders.
    Post-pandemic, more people are choosing to live where 
businesses can recruit and retain employees. Much of this 
growth is happening in and around rural gateway communities. 
Sustainable development of recreation economies near parks, 
forests, and BLM lands is critical to supporting their 
conservation needs and the needs of small and mid-sized 
businesses who form the backbone of these communities.
    The Gateway Communities and Recreation Enhancement Act will 
help planning in ways that address challenges around housing, 
overcrowding, and workforce development. Based on our 
industry's growing workforce challenges, investing in 
vocational training programs and public-private partnerships 
could help increase the capacity and potential of rural 
partnerships.
    Also, a unified way of collecting and showcasing real-time 
visitation data will help disperse visitor use to lesser 
trafficked areas. This, in turn, can help alleviate 
overcrowding without local communities feeling the economic 
harms of reduced tourism.
    As you finalize these pieces of legislation, I hope a few 
minor changes in my written testimony can be made to the bills 
before they move through Committee, especially around including 
all agencies that manage Federal lands and waters.
    This common-sense package of bills we hope will include the 
two we are discussing today, which are wins for Republicans, 
Democrats, businesses, and the American people, including 
future generations of outdoor lovers who also deserve to 
benefit from the outdoors.
    We hope a transformative recreation package will pass and 
be signed into law this year, and we look forward to working 
with you and your Senate counterparts to ensure this. Thank you 
again, and I look forward to answering your questions.

   Prepared Statement of Ambreen Tariq, Outdoor Recreation Roundtable
                       on H.R. 3107 and H.R. 3200

    On behalf of the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable, thank you for the 
opportunity to submit testimony to this hearing. Our industry is in 
strong support of several important recreation provisions, including 
the Improving Outdoor Recreation Coordination Act (H.R. 3107) and the 
Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement Act (H.R. 3200). I would 
also like to express our appreciation to the sponsors of these 
bipartisan pieces of legislation--Representatives Zinke, Peltola, 
Neguse, Lawler, and more--whose leadership on these bills will help 
strengthen coordination and focus on the recreation economy for both 
federal agencies and rural communities.
    In my role as the Senior Program Director at ORR I work on issues 
of workforce, access, and economic development related to outdoor 
recreation. I also coordinate a program called Together Outdoors, a 
coalition that aims to increase diversity and nurture an environment 
where all people have welcoming outdoor experiences in outdoor 
recreation through engagement, partnership, and action. I have over a 
decade of experience in labor and environmental and this has given me a 
unique perspective into how business bottom line is intrinsically 
connected to our natural resources and land and water management 
decisions and outcomes.
    The Outdoor Recreation Roundtable (ORR) is the nation's leading 
coalition of outdoor recreation associations representing the more than 
110,000 outdoor businesses in the recreation economy and the full 
spectrum of outdoor-related activities. Recently released data from the 
U.S. Department of Commerce shows that outdoor recreation generated 
$862 billion and 4.5 million American jobs in 2021, comprising 2% of 
the nation's economy and 3% of all employees in the country.\1\ The 
data also shows that outdoor recreation's growth tripled that of the 
national economy from 2020-2021 as we saw more people flocking to the 
outdoors and valuing how important time outside is to our mental and 
physical health, quality of life, as well as helping strengthen rural 
communities and economies.

a Percentage of Gross Domestic Product'' (accessed Friday, September

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Despite the increased numbers our industry is seeing in visitation 
and participation, there are growing challenges to consider. How do we 
accommodate more visitors while ensuring quality outdoor recreation 
experiences and the health of our public lands and waters? How do we 
support businesses impacted by canceled trips and travel or closures 
from fires and smoke? How do we make sure communities have the 
assistance they need to support sustainable recreation while advancing 
equitable access to front-country and backcountry outdoor recreation? 
These bills, along with several other bipartisan and bicameral 
provisions we hope to see come together in a recreation package by the 
end of the year, are about the federal government working better for 
businesses, states, the communities who rely on recreation assets, and 
the American people who enjoy them. Whether it is a manufacturer in 
Wisconsin, a ski resort in Colorado, or a family-owned diner outside a 
popular national park, businesses in our industry are like others in 
that they need certainty to continue to make investments in their 
employees and serve their customers. Both bills provide this much-
needed certainty through good government collaboration at the highest 
levels and on-the-ground tools for main street businesses and rural 
communities.
Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation (FICOR)

    While several land and water management agencies have traditionally 
been the main entities prioritizing outdoor recreation policies, 
virtually the entire federal government is engaged with aspects of 
today's thriving outdoor recreation economy. Coordination among these 
agencies helps to build a collaborative culture by which they can share 
innovative ideas, approach challenges that cut across various 
jurisdictions, and work together to make long term and beneficial 
impacts. This is much like what ORR does for our members every day--
bringing together industry leaders to work on issues that improve and 
grow the entire recreation community, whether you are a hunter, 
climber, RVer, hiker, boater, or biker.
    As outdoor recreation continues to grow in importance for policy 
priorities--from rural economic development and transportation to 
health and equity--this level of coordination is critical because it 
ensures that agencies are aligned internally and provides a single 
point of contact externally for outdoor recreation stakeholders--
including our members and the industry.
    The Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation could help 
important efforts, like Together Outdoors, by bringing together 
agencies around important issues of welcoming new users outdoors and 
telling the stories of those communities who have diverse and historic 
relationships to our public lands and waters.
    At its core, the Improving Outdoor Recreation Coordination Act is 
about breaking down government silos so we can see a better return on 
investment for taxpayer dollars and come up with the best policies for 
our industries' biggest opportunities and challenges. This legislation 
will result in better management of our federal lands and waters, more 
coordinated policies across federal agencies, and valuable interactions 
with non-federal partners.

    As you finalize this legislation, I would like to suggest a few 
small changes to the bill before it moves through committee.

  1.  Many agencies are doing important work for our sector that are 
            not currently members of FICOR and we hope many others will 
            also engage in this policy space. As such, it is important 
            to ensure that FICOR has the ability to add new members, as 
            necessary.

  2.  It would be more appropriate for the National Oceanic and 
            Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as a whole to be included 
            in this group rather than NOAA Fisheries, because NOAA is 
            larger in scope and includes other recreation activities 
            like scuba diving and boating.

  3.  FICOR should be supported equally across all necessary 
            Departments, rather than just by one agency, to ensure 
            commitment of support from the various land and water 
            management agencies. And, since FICOR is already up and 
            running with a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), this 
            legislation should be flexible enough in design to allow 
            continued coordination practices by the principals of the 
            agencies.

  4.  We greatly appreciate that the legislation invites state 
            representatives to FICOR meetings, and we recommend this 
            invitation be extended to include Tribal participation as 
            well.

  5.  The Outdoor Recreation Roundtable and several of our members have 
            been extremely active in working with states to create 
            state Offices of Outdoor Recreation. To date, 20 such 
            offices have been created. These offices are tasked with 
            state coordination around outdoor recreation and have had a 
            great impact on state policies as well as coordination 
            among red, blue, and purple states to leverage best 
            practices from across the country that drive business and 
            build thriving communities. FICOR should coordinate with 
            these states and any others who create state Offices of 
            Outdoor Recreation, as well as with state leaders and 
            interests.

Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement Act

    Post-pandemic, more people are choosing to live where businesses 
know they can recruit and retain employees. Much of this growth is 
happening in and around rural gateway communities. Attention to the 
authentic and sustainable development of recreation economies in places 
near parks, forests, and Bureau of Land Management lands is critical to 
supporting not only conservation of those natural resources that are 
often the driving forces behind this growth, but also the small to mid-
sized businesses who are the backbone of these communities.

    The Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement Act will help 
communities plan for recreation in ways that support key areas like 
housing, over-crowding, and workforce development.

  1.  As we are seeing one of our biggest issues in workforce, the 
            opportunity to capitalize on vocational training programs 
            and public-private partnerships could help increase the 
            capacity and business potential of rural entrepreneurship.

  2.  A unified way of collecting and showcasing real-time visitation 
            data will also help disperse visitor use to lesser-
            trafficked areas. This will help alleviate the overcrowding 
            we are seeing in some of our iconic places, but without 
            local communities feeling the economic harms of reduced 
            tourism. Having a single model that can compare and 
            contrast location-based activities with accurate, real-time 
            data on visitor movements and recreational activities will 
            allow land managers, lawmakers, and businesses to make more 
            informed decisions around resource allocation and 
            management. This will also help visitors who plan and save 
            for months for such a trip to make better choices around 
            how, when, and where they take these trips.

  3.  Similar to the FICOR legislation, we suggest that this bill 
            expand to other agencies like NOAA, the U.S. Army Corps of 
            Engineers, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. A better 
            definition than using the Federal Lands Recreation 
            Enhancement Act-related agencies might be found in the 
            Every Kid in a Park Act, which encompasses a broader range 
            of agencies that provide recreation-related services on 
            public lands and waters.

First-ever Recreation Package

    I would also like to thank this Committee for your continued work 
on bringing together bipartisan and bicameral bills in a first-ever 
recreation package. Similar legislation, the America's Outdoor 
Recreation Act, has passed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources 
committee unanimously twice. This common-sense package of bills, which 
I hope will include the two we are discussing today, is a collection of 
important outdoor recreation policies--some of which have been worked 
on for decades. Many of them fix deeply urgent needs for climbers, 
anglers, hunters, RVers, and all the businesses who provide world-class 
outdoor experiences. There is no bigger legislative priority for the 
entire outdoor recreation industry than AORA. We hope this 
transformative bill will pass and be signed into law this year and we 
look forward to working with you and your Senate counterparts to ensure 
that happens.
    Thank you for your continued commitment to the outdoors and for 
advancing these important bills. Both recreation bills discussed today 
are wins for Republicans and Democrats, American businesses, and the 
American people--not just today's recreationists but also future 
generations of outdoor lovers who we hope will gain the same benefits 
we do from time spent in nature. Thank you again.

                                 ______
                                 

    Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Ms. Tariq.
    I will now recognize Mr. Delano Hunter, the Acting Director 
for the D.C. Department of General Services, to testify for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Hunter.

STATEMENT OF DELANO HUNTER, ACTING DIRECTOR, D.C. DEPARTMENT OF 
                GENERAL SERVICES, WASHINGTON, DC

    Mr. Hunter. Good afternoon, Chairman Tiffany and members of 
the Subcommittee on Federal Lands. My name is Delano Hunter, 
and I am the Acting Director of the Department of General 
Services for the District of Columbia under the leadership of 
Mayor Muriel Bowser. And prior to 6 months ago, I served 4 
years as the District's Director of the Department of Parks and 
Recreation, where I developed a keen understanding of the 
importance of recreation in our city. Now, as the Director of 
DGS, I am responsible for the construction and maintenance of 
facilities, including DC's parks.
    What I know from both roles is that recreation and the 
facilities where recreation happens contribute greatly to the 
overall wellness of our community. With this understanding and 
on behalf of Mayor Bowser and the 700,000 residents who call 
Washington, DC home, I am pleased to testify in support of H.R. 
4984, the D.C. Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus 
Revitalization Act.
    This bill was introduced by Chairman James Comer of the 
House Oversight and Accountability Committee and our 
Congresswoman, Eleanor Holmes Norton. For more than 30 years, 
Congresswoman Norton has worked with Congress on legislation to 
make the nation's capital a more dynamic place to live, work, 
and visit. This monumental legislation has the potential to 
transform and expand recreation in our city for generations to 
come.
    Washington, DC has a rich tradition of recreation and 
sport. We are proud that for 3 consecutive years, DC has been 
ranked the No. 1 big-city park system in the nation by the 
Trust for Public Land, which ranks the 100 most populous cities 
and is considered the gold standard for park evaluation. This 
distinction recognizes that we have Federal parks and local 
recreation amenities that complement one another, a system that 
is the result of a strong, trusting, and long-standing 
partnership between the District and National Park Service.
    Look no further than the revitalization of Franklin Park in 
downtown. This once under-utilized green space that over the 
years has fallen into disrepair has now become a hub of 
activity for residents, downtown office workers, and tourists 
alike. In addition to having a beautiful space and a playground 
for children, the park frequently hosts movie nights, 
festivals, and concerts. This transformation of Franklin Park 
was only made possible through a cooperative management 
agreement between the District and the National Park Service.
    This partnership is nothing new. The D.C. Stadium Act of 
1957 is a foundational example of the early trust NPS placed in 
the District. Of course, to many, the RFK site is synonymous 
with the glory years of the Washington football franchise now 
known as the Commanders. It was also home of the Washington 
Senators, and enabled the return of major league baseball to 
the District with the Washington Nationals. D.C. United also 
called this site home during their early years, and it was 
there that they won multiple major league soccer titles.
    Beyond professional sports, RFK hosted countless high 
school and college athletic competitions. And as a native 
Washingtonian and former athlete at the Spingarn High School 
across the street from RFK, I participated in the winning 
spirit at RFK.
    Today, however, the winning spirit along the Anacostia 
River banks can only be found in a handful of youth soccer 
fields surrounded by eroding parking lots, and lacking any 
significant investments. Despite the District's investments in 
fields and nearby trails, most of the 190-acre campus sits 
empty day in and day out. Instead of connecting our community 
or serving as a grand entryway to the east side of our 
monumental core, it is mostly a desolate sea of asphalt.
    We can do better. Under the District's stewardship, we can 
transform and activate the RFK campus so that it becomes a 
world-class destination for families, residents, and visitors, 
while also better connecting our beautiful waterfront to the 
neighborhoods along its banks. This revitalization will 
complement investments already underway, including the 20-mile 
Anacostia Riverwalk Trail; the investments in the fields at 
RFK, which are a collection of soccer fields; and also 
investments in environmental programing in Kingman and Heritage 
Island.
    We envision increased access to organized leisure and 
recreation opportunities. We also see the potential for 
economic development, which could include housing and 
professional sports.
    From the perspective of youth sports, we envision the 
campus becoming a premier destination for athletic competition. 
DC is no stranger to world-class athletes. Unfortunately, they 
travel far and wide to participate in the highest level of 
competition. Amenities at this type of sports complex, which 
would be under the leadership of our Department of Parks and 
Recreation, would include an Olympic swimming pool, a 
gymnastics training facility, an indoor track and multi-purpose 
field, a boxing training facility, a health and fitness club, 
and so much more.
    The expansive potential for the RFK campus is why Mayor 
Bowser included seed funding, and she unequivocally supports 
this legislation. However, to become a reality, the work of 
this Committee and, indeed, this Congress is essential.
    Today, the RFK site is at a legal stalemate, bound by a 
nearly 70-year-old lease that expires in 15 years. This 
stalemate prevents the comprehensive redevelopment necessary to 
revitalize this site. The District has a proven history of 
activating NPS lands to premier conditions that are consistent 
with a world-class capital city. We did it at Franklin Park. We 
have transformed Federal spaces across DC, including at the 
wharf and Saint Elizabeth east campus and Walter Reed. And 
given the opportunity, we will do it again at RFK.
    Thank you for your time, and I look forward to answering 
your questions.

    [The prepared statement of Mr. Hunter follows:]
  Prepared Statement of Delano Hunter, Director of the Department of 
                  General Services for Washington, DC
                              on H.R. 4984

    Good afternoon, Chairman Tiffany and members of the Subcommittee on 
Federal Lands. My name is Delano Hunter, and I am the Acting Director 
of the Department of General Services for the Government of the 
District of Columbia under the leadership of Mayor Muriel Bowser. Prior

    What I know from both of these roles is that recreation, and the 
facilities where recreation happens, contribute greatly to the overall 
wellness of our community.
    With this understanding, and on behalf of Mayor Bowser and the

in support of H.R. 4984, the D.C. Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium 
Campus Revitalization Act. This bill was introduced by Chairman James 
Comer of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee and our 
Congresswoman, Eleanor Holmes Norton. For more than 30 years, 
Congresswoman Norton has worked with Congress on legislation to make 
the nation's capital a more dynamic place to live, work, and visit. 
This monumental legislation has the potential to transform and expand 
recreational opportunity in the District of Columbia for our residents, 
our region, and the more than 20 million visitors who come to our city 
each year.
    Washington, DC has a rich tradition of recreation and sport. We are 
proud that for three consecutive years Washington, DC has been ranked 
the number one big city park system in the nation by the Trust for 
Public Land through its annual ParkScore Index, which ranks the 100 
most populous U.S. cities and is considered the gold standard for park 
evaluation.
    This very honorable distinction recognizes that we have federal 
parks and local recreation amenities that complement one another--a 
system that is the result of a strong, trusting, and long-standing 
partnership between the District and the National Park Service. Look no 
further than the revitalization of Franklin Park in downtown. This 
once-underutilized greenspace that, over the years, had fallen into 
disrepair has now become a hub of activity for residents, downtown 
office workers, and tourists alike. In addition to having beautiful 
spaces and a playground for children, the park frequently hosts movie 
nights, festivals, concerts, and more; including, just recently, a 
celebration of the new football season. The transformation of Franklin 
Park was only made possible through a Cooperative Management Agreement 
executed between the District and NPS.
    This partnership is not new. The DC Stadium Act of 1957 is a 
foundational example of the early trust NPS placed in the District. Of 
course, to many DC residents, the RFK site is synonymous with the glory 
years of the Washington football franchise now known as the Commanders.

the Spingarn Senior High School across the street from RFK, I 
personally participated and enjoyed the winning spirit at RFK.
    Today, however, the winning spirit along the Anacostia River banks 
can only be found on a handful of youth soccer fields, surrounded by 
eroding parking lots and lacking any significant investments. Despite

better connecting our beautiful waterfront and the neighborhoods along 
its banks. This revitalization will complement investments already 
underway, including investments in the 20-mile Anacostia Riverwalk 
Trail, led by the District's Department of Transportation; investments 
in The Fields at RFK, managed by Events DC; and investments in and 
environmental programming on Kingman and Heritage Islands, under the 
stewardship of the DC Department of Energy and Environment. We envision 
increased access to organized recreation and leisure activities such as 
cycling and kayaking, and more outdoor space for cultural activations. 
We also see the potential for economic development, which could include 
housing and professional sports.
    From the perspective of youth sports, however, we envision the RFK 
campus becoming a premier destination for youth athletic competition. 
From basketball to cheerleading to boxing to ice skating and track and 
field, the District is home to many young athletes at the top of their 
sport. Unfortunately, without a centralized home or training facility, 
our athletes routinely travel outside of DC to compete in the highest-
level tournaments and events. Mayor Bowser's vision is for Washington, 
DC to host those events. That way we cannot only showcase our local 
talent, but more families, coaches, and organizations will see DC as a 
launching pad for America's athletes.

    The amenities at this type of sports complex could include:

    <bullet> Olympic swimming pool

    <bullet> Gymnastics training facility

    <bullet> Indoor track and multipurpose field

    <bullet> Boxing training facility

    <bullet> Climbing center and obstacle course

    <bullet> Health and Fitness Club

    <bullet> Indoor bowling alley

    <bullet> Indoor skating rink

    <bullet> Learning & creativity center for children

    <bullet> Amphitheatre

    <bullet> Indoor/outdoor cafe<greek-th>

    <bullet> Outdoor and Indoor basketball and tennis courts

    The expansive potential for uses at the RFK campus is why Mayor 
Bowser included seed funding in her budget to build a DC DPR Sports 
Complex.
    Mayor Bowser also unequivocally supports this legislation. However, 
to become a reality, the work of this Committee and, indeed, this 
Congress is essential.
    Today, the RFK site is at a legal stalemate bound by a nearly 70-
year-old lease that expires in 15 years. This stalemate prevents the

it at Franklin Park, we've transformed federal spaces across DC, 
including at the Wharf, the St. Elizabeths East campus, at Walter Reed, 
and, given the opportunity, we will do it at RFK.
    Thank you for your time, and I am happy to answer any questions you 
may have.

    Mr. Tiffany. Thank you very much, Director Hunter.
    At this time, the Committee will stand in recess, subject 
to the call of the Chair. I will be back here immediately after 
votes, and we will resume Committee activities with questions 
from Members as soon as we return.
    Thank you very much for your testimony. We are in recess.
    [Recess.]
    Mr. Tiffany. The Committee will come to order.
    And I would like to recognize Representative Stauber for 5 
minutes on H.R. 1657.

    STATEMENT OF THE HON. PETE STAUBER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MINNESOTA

    Mr. Stauber. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair and Ranking 
Member Neguse. I want to thank you for convening this important 
hearing today and allowing me to present today H.R. 1657, the 
Lake Winnibigoshish Land Exchange Act of 2023.
    I, first of all, want to thank my constituent, Itasca 
County Commissioner Cory Smith, for his willingness to testify 
on the legislation.
    I would also like to thank Ranking Member Neguse and 
Representative Huffman for their co-sponsorship of this bill, 
along with my Minnesota delegation colleagues, Representative 
Fischbach and Representative Finstad, for their support.
    This land exchange bill is a simple land exchange that will 
help ensure management of our public lands is fit for purpose 
and help accomplish the focus of this hearing: expanding access 
to outdoor recreation on our public lands.
    Lake Winnibigoshish, located in the Chippewa National 
Forest, is home to Bowen Lodge, a premier, family-owned fishing 
lodge right in the district that I have the privilege of 
representing. And it has been in operation and welcoming 
Minnesotans since 1925. For the past four decades, Bill and 
Gail Heig have operated Bowen Lodge, serving as incredible 
stewards of Lake Winnibigoshish and providing incredible 
fishing and recreation for a countless number of my 
constituents over the years.
    Currently, Bowen Lodge has a 20-year lease with the U.S. 
Forest Service to lease approximately 13.8 acres of shoreline 
along the lake, where they operate their marina. Under the 
Heig's stewardship, Lake Winnibigoshish has remained accessible 
to the citizens of Itasca County. It is important that the 
shores of Lake Winnie be open for all of those who want to 
recreate and enjoy what it has to offer.
    This land exchange bill would facilitate a land exchange 
between Bowen Lodge and the Forest Service, providing permanent 
access to the lakeshore and marina, along with certainty for 
the greater Itasca community. In exchange for this land, the 
resort would convey approximately 38 acres of nearby land to 
the Forest Service, which then would be added to the Chippewa 
National Forest.
    Notably, the Heigs purchased the 38 acres of nearby land in 
2021, after a California-based mega-resort developer sought to 
purchase this parcel of land in order to build a massive luxury 
resort which would have changed the face of Lake Winnie. 
Instead, the Heigs purchased this land to preserve recreational 
access for the local community and preserve the biodiversity of 
the area. Now the Heigs are seeking to convey this land to the 
Chippewa National Forest, since it is in the best interest of 
the public for the Forest Service to take stewardship of this 
land and preserve public access, rather than out-of-state 
developers being able to change the community forever.
    This exchange would better align proper boundaries, put the 
right acreage under the right management, and ensure my 
constituents have the ability to boat, fish, and enjoy 
beautiful Lake Winnie. This exchange is supported by the local 
community in Itasca County, including the local County Board of 
Supervisors and environmental organizations. It is also 
supported by the U.S. Forest Service and leadership of the 
Chippewa National Forest, which we will hear about this 
afternoon.
    I appreciate the opportunity to present my bill before the 
Committee today, and I look forward to our discussion.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Representative Stauber.
    Now, I would like to recognize the Ranking Member of the 
Full Committee, Representative Grijalva.
    Mr. Grijalva. Excuse me, Mr. Chairman. We are in the 
question part of the panel, or not yet?
    Mr. Tiffany. If you have a statement.
    Mr. Grijalva. Oh, yes, I appreciate that. Thank you for 
indulging.
    Mr. Tiffany. And then we will go to questions after.

  STATEMENT OF THE HON. RAUL M. GRIJALVA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
               CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA

    Mr. Grijalva. Let me first thank you for holding this 
hearing and these four bills related to outdoor recreation.
    I would like to address my remarks to H.R. 4984, D.C. 
Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus Revitalization Act, 
introduced by House Oversight Committee Chair, along with 
Representative Holmes Norton, who fiercely represents the 
District of Columbia.
    The RFK Stadium has had a long and storied history. It was, 
of course, home to the Washington football team during their 
three championship runs. And in the 60-plus years since its 
construction, it has hosted men and women's World Cup matches, 
car races, bike rides, Grateful Dead shows, and much, much 
more. It has had a good run, but the stadium is now past its 
prime and slated to be torn down.
    Of course, there is a lot of interest in the future 
development plans for the site, and the stadium is located in a 
prime location in the heart of Washington, DC. The land could 
help address many of the city's needs, including increasing the 
stock of available, affordable housing and securing access to 
open space. I believe achieving the right balance here is key.
    The land is currently administered by the National Park 
Service as part of the Anacostia Park and, as highlighted in 
the Interior Department's testimony, part of a long-standing 
plan for public gardens and open space. As drafted, H.R. 4984 
includes language that guarantees that 30 percent of the 
property is issued for open space and park land. However, DOI 
has requested to work on further amendments to ensure the 
viability of these guarantees.
    This is, Mr. Chairman, the critical part of this 
legislation and any further plans for the site. So, I would 
encourage the Committee to continue working with the Department 
as this bill moves forward in the legislative process.
    I also want to note that for over 50 years, the stadium 
site has been an enduring tribute to the life and legacy of 
Robert Francis Kennedy. One way or another, whether through 
legislation or some other guarantee, this should remain a 
lasting feature of the site.
    Finally, I would like to acknowledge that while there 
appears to be broad support in DC government for this bill, 
there is not a unified position on what should be developed on 
this site or whether or not, for example, there should be a new 
stadium. And if so, if tax dollars should pay for it.
    In addition, there is a strong desire to ensure affordable 
housing is a part of the equation. I hope, Mr. Chairman, as we 
move forward, that these issues remain part of the equation, 
and there are not any attempts to hamstring the District's 
decision-making ability on these issues, and that they work in 
concurrence with the Department and with the sponsors of the 
legislation to deal with those three points that I brought up.
    With that, I yield back, sir, and thank you for the 
indulgence.
    Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Representative Grijalva. Now we 
will go on to questions at this time, and I am going to start 
out with 5 minutes worth of questioning.
    First, Ms. Emanuel, in regards to closures on Forest 
Service land, I have experienced multiple closures on National 
Forest Land System land and amenities throughout my district in 
northern Wisconsin. I hear about it from frustrated 
constituents. In fact, we are going to have a hearing in 
regards to this coming early October. It is from people who 
want to recreate, hunt, fish, camp, and enjoy our Federal 
lands.
    Does the Forest Service coordinate with local stakeholders 
before reducing access?
    Ms. Emanuel. So, the question is whether we coordinate with 
the state entity on a closure?
    Mr. Tiffany. State and local.
    Ms. Emanuel. State and local. When we must close an area, 
the closure is usually related to public health and safety, and 
we have a process for noticing that, and we generally 
coordinate with all affected parties any time we have to close 
an area.
    Mr. Tiffany. So, it is your understanding that you always 
contact those local and state governments that are being 
affected by this?
    Ms. Emanuel. I would say that that is the plan. I mean, the 
ideal situation would be to coordinate any closure with an 
affected stakeholder. I don't know that that can always happen, 
depending on what the situation is.
    Mr. Tiffany. The requirement to coordinate, isn't that a 
requirement?
    Ms. Emanuel. To coordinate closures? If it is our land, and 
it depends on the reason for closure, but I would think that we 
would generally reach out and connect with all affected 
parties, especially if it is a longer-term closure.
    Mr. Tiffany. How does the Forest Service define 
coordination?
    Ms. Emanuel. Working with others, communicating.
    Mr. Tiffany. If you go back to, like, FLPMA and some of the 
other overriding statutes that were put in place over 50 years 
ago, they specifically required coordination.
    And I don't know, Mr. Reynolds, if you want to jump in also 
in regards to this, you are certainly welcome to, either one of 
you, if you want to answer that question.
    How is coordination actually practiced with local 
communities?
    Mr. Reynolds. I will chime in and just say we, much like 
our Forest Service colleagues, have it in policy. For example, 
there are civic engagement policies under our director's 
orders. There is the definition of communication and 
coordination in our policy manuals for the field 
superintendents. So, much like the Forest Service, we do 
require that standard of our field employees, and we are happy 
to talk about it if it is not happening.
    Mr. Tiffany. Representative Zinke's bill would require the 
National Park Service to coordinate with local stakeholders, 
hold public meetings, and open at least a 60-day comment period 
before any action is taken to reduce access. Would the Forest 
Service support including similar requirements before reducing 
access on the National Forest System? Either of you.
    Ms. Emanuel. I am sorry, sir. Could you repeat that?
    Mr. Tiffany. The National Park Service, under this proposal 
before us, would require at least a 60-day comment period 
before any action could be taken to reduce access. So, that is 
really the heart of the proposal. Would you support something 
similar to that for the National Forest System, in addition to 
the National Park Service?
    Ms. Emanuel. I think we would have to look and see what 
policy is in place, and whether or not it is working. But we 
certainly support whatever outcome you are trying to get after 
here. If we can improve on the kind of coordination that is 
needed to give people the kind of experience we want, we want 
to do that.
    Mr. Tiffany. Earlier this year, during another hearing 
focused on recreation, I asked the Forest Service about 
closures of boat ramps and other Forest Service facilities in 
my district. The Forest Service followed up and assured me 
there are plans and funding available to rehabilitate boat 
launches at Beaver Lake, Cisco Lake, Stock Farm, Twin Lake, and 
Mondeaux. Do you have an update on the status of those boat 
launches?
    Ms. Emanuel. I can certainly get you a status on those, but 
I do understand that we are investing in those boat ramps.
    Mr. Tiffany. So, I would just highlight for you that we are 
having a hearing in regards to access that is coming up here 
real soon in a couple of weeks. And it is a big concern by a 
number of my constituents that access is being denied to the 
National Forest System.
    With that, I will yield and I would like to recognize 
Representative Leger Fernandez for 5 minutes for questioning.
    Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you, witnesses, for your testimony. As we were 
moving back and forth between the votes, I was listening to it 
in my office and over the microphones. And I was really 
appreciative of the incredible work that each of you are doing 
with respect for the importance that having coordination and 
access to our public lands for all Americans is really key.
    New Mexico is home to nearly 25 million acres of Federal 
land, and we understand deeply the importance of creating ways 
for our people, wherever you live and whatever your 
socioeconomic circumstances are, to be able to enjoy those 
lands, especially the beautiful outdoor areas. We have heard 
over and over again the benefits that these have for your 
health, the benefits that they have for how you feel, part of a 
community.
    I like to think that, as New Mexicans, we are a people of 
the land, Native Americans, Latinos, ranchers, we are people 
who really value our land and landscape.
    Mr. Reynolds, thank you for your testimony. I noticed that 
there is a 10-year survey that was released in 2020 from the 
Park Service that showed that 77 percent of park visitors were 
White. But we are a pluralistic society, a pluralistic country, 
the beautiful mosaic of Black Americans, Native Americans, 
Pacific Islanders, AAPI, the beautiful sort of diversity of our 
country and of our states. And what is sad is sometimes you 
read about people who live right next to a public land, but 
somehow don't make it there.
    Can you give us an example of how the Improving Outdoor 
Recreation Coordination Act would help the Park Service 
implement policies to improve that kind of access for everyone?
    You can use New Mexico or other places, if you like. Of 
course, I am from New Mexico, so if you tell me some New 
Mexican things, I am going to like it a lot.
    Mr. Reynolds. Yes. So, FICOR, which we have been under a 
Memorandum of Understanding right now, is working really well 
to talk about, particularly, I think, what you just eloquently 
spoke of, of serving underserved populations and trying to 
figure out how best to connect with them.
    It is going to leverage, if we could get this to stick 
around this Committee, the ability to communicate with these 
communities, the ability for the communities themselves to 
interact with the agencies. I will use a colloquialism of one-
stop-shopping, right? You can get all the land and water 
management agencies at one time.
    So, I think that the consistency in coordination and 
communication would be a long ways, especially when we are 
trying to reach larger populations that may not be using, to 
your point, the public lands. So, that is why we are very in 
favor of it from that side.
    Ms. Leger Fernandez. Right. And when we say this land is 
public land, is your land, people need to really feel that, and 
they are a part of it. And indeed, I think our public lands 
helps us create unity in this country.
    I think the people I serve with on this Committee really 
love the countries and the states that they live in, and the 
public lands that are there. They want to make sure everybody 
has access to them. And I do appreciate that sentiment that we 
have on this Committee.
    Ms. Emanuel, thank you for your testimony. I also 
understand that, while we want to increase access to our public 
lands, we must do so in a way that minimizes the negative 
impacts that visitors might have, and being respectful of the 
community's surroundings. Can you discuss how the Gateway 
Community and Recreation Enhancement Act would affect Forest 
Service coordination with gateway communities on tribal lands?
    Ms. Emanuel. Thank you for that. Yes, I think it can really 
help us expand and enhance existing partnerships that balance 
the needs, as you said, of holistic land management and travel 
and tourism opportunities and support just a little bit better 
understanding and coordination of how that balancing act can be 
in service to both heritage and cultural resource tourism, as 
well as protection of those resources.
    Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you very much.
    I have come so close to my time that I will submit any 
additional questions for the record.
    And I do want to appreciate, Mr. Chairman, the hearing you 
are having today. I really appreciate the bills that you have 
brought together as a group for us to listen to the testimony 
and consider today. So, thank you very much.
    Mr. Tiffany. The gentlewoman yields. I would like to 
recognize the gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. Stauber, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Stauber. Thank you, Mr. Chair. The pieces of 
legislation before us today are so important in expanding 
access to outdoor recreation and ensuring our constituents have 
access to our public lands.
    I would first like to turn to Commissioner Smith.
    Commissioner Smith, can you expand upon the importance of 
the recreation economy to Itasca County?
    And how does the Chippewa National Forest contribute to 
your economy?
    Mr. Smith. Thank you. Recreation is pretty much our sole 
investment, especially in my district. It is about 80 percent. 
Our population jumps up by about 80 percent in the county come 
every opening of fishing.
    Mr. Stauber. I have been part of that 80 percent, by the 
way.
    Mr. Smith. Yes. And if you haven't been there, I would tell 
you to get there. That is the reason why our county jumps up in 
population is because of the outdoors and the recreation that 
we have, and that we have had for many a year.
    Mr. Stauber. Thank you. In my opening remarks, I mentioned 
how the Heig family was able to secure a 20-year permit from 
the Forest Service to operate a marina at Bowen Lodge along 
Lake Winnie, as well as secure the nearby private lands. If the 
Heigs were not able to do so, and a large, out-of-state 
developer was able to secure the land, what kind of effect 
would that have on the community?
    Mr. Smith. I am afraid it would have been a negative 
effect.
    We love visitors. We thrive on visitors. And that lake 
association group has created a culture there that is why the 
lake is pristine and beautiful the way it is.
    And let's not forget the Heigs did step up to the plate for 
our community and for our county when that group was going to 
come in and maybe weren't in the financial position, but did 
buy that property.
    Mr. Stauber. Yes.
    Deputy Chief Emanuel, in your written testimony you note 
that the Forest Service has to spend resources to support a 
special use permit for the acreage under discussion today. Can 
you share how those resources can be better directed to other 
parts of the Chippewa National Forest to better serve the local 
community and its visitors?
    Ms. Emanuel. Any time we free up resources, we are going to 
be able to direct them into other local sites there on the 
Chippewa. And I am sure that there is a list of recreation 
infrastructure projects that could all benefit from additional 
resources, and I am sure there is no short list for that forest 
to make those decisions.
    Mr. Stauber. I agree with you, thank you.
    Along this area, there is currently a checkerboard pattern 
of landownership between public and private lands which this 
legislation would address. Can you expand upon the benefits of 
consolidating this land?
    Ms. Emanuel. Yes, absolutely. Thanks for that.
    We see this a lot in the West, obviously, and it really 
presents challenges for both private landowners and the Federal 
land management agencies trying to manage for multiple purposes 
and reasons. So, to the extent we can strategically connect 
those places that make sense, it is going to be a better 
experience for everybody involved.
    Mr. Stauber. Thank you.
    Mr. Chair, I would like to take the last few minutes here 
to talk about H.R. 3200, the Gateway Community Recreation 
Enhancement Act. As I have discussed in this Committee 
countless times, the district I represent is incredible with 
public lands that Americans from across the country come to 
enjoy.
    In addition to the Chippewa National Forest, my home 
county, St. Louis County, is home to the Superior National 
Forest and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area. Individuals from 
across the state and entire country travel there each year. 
Unfortunately, however, some of those individuals get lost or 
need medical attention. Rather than the Forest Service 
responding to those calls, it is local emergency responders in 
places like St. Louis County that respond to those calls and 
lead search and rescue efforts. And it is these local emergency 
responders that have to foot the bill.
    It is important that we address these cost burdens that 
fall on local and county governments in gateway communities in 
and around our Federal lands. We can't leave our local and 
county governments hanging. I believe H.R. 3200 can play an 
important role in building upon collaboration in gateway 
communities, and find solutions to the funding issue 
jurisdictions like St. Louis County are facing. When somebody 
gets lost or injured in the Boundary Waters, it is not 
necessarily the Forest Service. It is the St. Louis County 
Rescue Squad, it is the Ely Ambulance, it is the Cook 
Ambulance, these volunteer rescue squads. And they expel 
resources and they don't get paid for that cost, and it is 
using their equipment, and that is a burden on the local 
taxpayers.
    So, one of the things that I think we ought to do, Mr. 
Chair, is in that piece of legislation really look at how we 
can reimburse those local communities that respond to our 
Federal emergencies on our Federal lands.
    And I yield back.
    Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields. I would like to 
recognize Representative Grijalva, the Ranking Member of the 
Full Committee, for 5 minutes of questions.
    Mr. Grijalva. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Reynolds, when Congress initially authorized the 
District of Columbia to build a stadium, the terms of the lease 
were very strict. It only allowed development for stadium 
purposes. H.R. 4984 loosens those terms to include other 
recreational and commercial development.
    Can you discuss how a lease with these expanded areas can 
remain consistent with what the National Park Service's long-
term plan for Anacostia Park is, i.e. the 30 percent public 
access, open space, public recreation areas?
    And in that process, how would issues such as the 30 
percent the District of Columbia already has in terms of 
affordable housing for new development, how would that be 
mandated since it is a lease and not a law from the District?
    And how would the appropriate legacy memorial for Robert F. 
Kennedy be dealt with? Can they be dealt with in this lease 
process, or is that a separate issue that Congress must 
undertake?
    Mr. Reynolds. Thank you, Congressman. Those are really 
detailed questions, some of which we would be able to work out 
if we could get our technical folks to sit down and work out 
each of those.
    But I will give you a top-level bottom line is the Park 
Service is just very interested in working with GSA, working 
with Washington, DC. And I defer to them about what they really 
want with the property to make sure this piece of land is put 
into a vibrant part of the city, while at the same time our 
main concern is just making sure, as you mentioned, sir, the 30 
percent areas, and particularly access to the Anacostia 
Waterfront, Anacostia Trail are maintained and/or enhanced as a 
part of the lease.
    So, the leases can be flexible to address the needs, as all 
the parties see fit, if the legislation doesn't prevent 
something. So, we would be able to work with all of those 
things you mentioned as long as we preserve some of the 
recreation and access concerns.
    Mr. Grijalva. Thank you.
    Let me follow that, Mr. Hunter, thank you for being here. 
H.R. 4984, in addition to the bold outline in your testimony, 
vision for the future of RFK Stadium, including recreational 
and athletic outdoor recreation amenities. These would all be 
possible under the expanded authorization of H.R. 4984.
    In addition to a swimming pool, basketball courts, and 
other training facilities, this bill is pretty open-ended on 
the types of development that can be allowed. Can you explain 
how the District will make decisions about future projects and 
development on that land?
    And if residential development is a component of future 
plans, how will the District guarantee the construction of 
affordable housing as part of the mix?
    Mr. Hunter. Sure, thank you for the question, 
Representative.
    First, I would say that the reason we are really excited 
about this bill is what it can do for recreation. And to your 
point, it provides an opportunity to really transform how we do 
recreation here in the city. We have always been proud of our 
park systems that are comprised of both local and Federal 
assets. In fact, we have been ranked as having the best big-
city park system in the nation for 3 consecutive years.
    But there are some gaps there. We have longed for a 
destination athletic complex where we can further the athletic 
pursuits of our top athletes, also where we can host 
tournaments, and also things that we just can't do in some of 
our neighborhoods where we just don't have the space. So, I 
think that this bill contemplates robust recreation 
opportunities.
    As it relates to some of the other components, the Mayor is 
studying, though she is on the record in support of returning 
RFK Stadium, but if you look at some of the adjacent 
developments like in Hill East, it has a very substantial 
affordable housing component. If you look at some of the other 
developments along the Anacostia River, we have shown that we 
can do both recreation, some retail, economic development, and 
housing, how they can co-exist in the space.
    Mr. Grijalva. Any reaction to that being part of a lease 
agreement, this is also, as I see it, and as it was explained 
earlier on in another form of this legislation, was part of a 
redevelopment and revitalization initiative, as well, in terms 
of the area and the region. Is it appropriate to list those as 
part of a lease process that would kind of bind all the 
parties, including the Federal Government and Congress, to that 
commitment?
    Mr. Hunter. That is correct. To Mr. Reynolds' point, 
typically, when we get to the process of developing a lease, or 
in some instances a cooperative management agreement, it would 
spell out the specific uses for that property.
    Mr. Grijalva. I yield back, sir. Thank you.
    Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields, and now I would like to 
recognize the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, Mr. Neguse, 
for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. JOE NEGUSE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO

    Mr. Neguse. I thank the Chairman, and good afternoon to all 
of our witnesses. It is good to be back in the Committee room, 
and want to start by saying that I appreciate the focus of 
today's hearing on the four bills that all have some connection 
to outdoor recreation, a topic that is incredibly important to 
my constituents back home in Colorado.
    With visitation numbers continuing to climb year after 
year, the wide variety of outdoor recreation activities that 
occur on and adjacent to Federal land really have become an 
economic pillar for countless communities throughout the 
country, including in my state in Colorado.
    As I am sure you all know, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, 
according to them, outdoor recreation contributed $454 billion 
to the national economy in 2021. And my district happens to be 
home to the most visited national forest in the country, the 
White River National Forest, and some of the most beautiful 
outdoor recreation opportunities in the nation. So, I am 
grateful to have this opportunity to consider some bills that I 
think are integral to that mission of supporting outdoor 
recreation that I know is a bipartisan one, and one I think 
that is shared across party lines.
    I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to talk about 
my bipartisan bill, H.R. 3107, the Improving Outdoor Recreation 
Coordination Act, which would, in effect, codify FICOR, an 
entity with a proven track record of elevating recreation in a 
way that makes it more accessible and visible for all 
Americans. It has been responsible for critical improvements to 
Recreation.gov and the incredibly popular Every Kid Outdoors 
program, among a variety of other initiatives, and I am very 
excited to help get that bill across the finish line.
    I understand that the Department certainly has some 
suggestions on potential improvements to the bill, and we are 
very amenable to working, of course, with the Department, with 
the National Park Service to ensure that the bill is ready to 
be considered by the Full Committee, and ultimately by the 
House.
    With that, I don't have any particular questions. I 
appreciate, as I said, the witnesses taking the time to testify 
today and, of course, the written testimony you have submitted. 
And I look forward to engaging on these four bills, in 
particular, in the months ahead.
    And with that, I yield back to the Chairman.
    Mr. Tiffany. Thank you very much, Mr. Neguse. And I just 
want to follow up with just a couple of final questions here.
    In regards to the Improving Outdoor Recreation Act, Ms. 
Tariq, what does the membership that you represent, what do 
they see as important in that bill?
    What is the focus that you think is most important?
    Ms. Tariq. Thank you for that question.
    One of the most important things for the outdoor recreation 
industry, in terms of businesses, is the need for certainty to 
be able to plan and make investments, whether it is in your 
workforce or your business in itself. So, in improving 
coordination and improving efficiencies, the ability to be able 
to plan toward that is extremely important.
    Also, the cost effectiveness of not having to start and 
shut down and start and shut down, and being able to depend on 
points of contact and actual planning forward. So, in terms of 
that, that is extremely important for the industry.
    Also, the ability to plan forward in terms of the future of 
equipment and technology. And we can only do that by having a 
group that we can go to consistently in terms of whether it is 
guidance, whether it is information, or just access to future 
plans of whether there is going to be reduced access and what 
not.
    So, I would say that is probably at the center of our 
priorities.
    Mr. Tiffany. Would you say that notice requirement is 
helpful?
    Ms. Tariq. Correct, in terms of all stakeholders in 
addition to businesses, but also local communities, and tribes, 
and everyone who is really involved and affected.
    Mr. Tiffany. I just want to wrap with one other question 
for Deputy Director Reynolds.
    How many facilities are currently closed or operating with 
reduced access for reasons other than health and safety?
    Mr. Reynolds. We try to not necessarily reduce access as 
much as manage visitors. And there are about 25 parks right 
now, 21 to 25 parks that I can think of off the top of my head, 
that have some sort of managed access program.
    Mr. Tiffany. Do you have a tracking on that that the public 
can access?
    Mr. Reynolds. We can certainly provide it if it is not 
readily available. I think that something like this bill can 
help us to shore those things up, just to be honest with you.
    They are tracked locally very much, the parks, as we were 
talking about earlier. The park superintendents are expected to 
interface with their communities, and their counties, and their 
folks around them. But on the national level, it may be harder 
to find.
    Mr. Tiffany. I think that tracking data would really be 
nice to have.
    Mr. Reynolds. Agreed.
    Mr. Tiffany. To the Ranking Member, do you have any follow 
up questions?
    Mr. Neguse. I do not.
    Mr. Tiffany. So, with that, I just want to thank all the 
witnesses for the valuable testimony and Members for your 
questions.
    Members of the Subcommittee may have some additional 
questions for our witnesses today, and we will ask that they 
respond to those in writing. Under Committee Rule 3, members of 
the Subcommittee must submit questions to the Subcommittee 
Clerk by 5 p.m. on Friday, September 22, 2023. The hearing 
record will be held open for 10 business days for these 
responses.
    If there is no further business, without objection, the 
Subcommittee on Federal Lands stands adjourned.

    [Whereupon, at 4:17 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

            [ADDITIONAL MATERIALS SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD]

Submission for the Record by Rep. Westerman

                        Statement for the Record
                         Trust for Public Land
                             In Support of
    H.R. 3107 the ``Improving Outdoor Recreation Coordination Act''

    At Trust for Public Land, we connect people to the outdoors. We 
create parks and protect land for people, ensuring healthy, livable 
communities for generations to come. We were founded in 1972 on the 
conviction that all people need access to nature and the outdoors, 
close to home, in the cities and communities where they live. We work 
with communities to create parks and protect public land where they're 
needed most, as a matter of health, equity, and justice.

    We are in support of this Act; however we encourage the Committee 
to include language which directs FICOR to make part of its purpose to 
focus on underserved communities, including Native tribes, that don't 
have access to public parks within a 10 minute walk to their home.

    Spending time outdoors is more than a nicety--it's a necessity for 
a happy, healthy life. But access to parks isn't equal, and disparities 
often fall on racial and economic divides. In low-income communities, 
communities of color, and rural areas, parks are fewer, smaller, more 
crowded, and less maintained than parks in higher-income or 
predominantly white communities. People need to feel that they are 
welcome and wanted at our public lands, and that they have open access 
to the outdoors.

    Increasing federal agency coordination and communication on public 
lands usage must therefore be approached with equity in mind. We 
therefore urge you to include provisions directing FICOR to focus on 
bringing equity in the use, access, and opportunities for underserved 
communities and public lands.

                NATIONAL PARKS CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION

                                             September 19, 2023    

Re: NPCA position on H.R. 3200--Gateway Community and Recreation 
        Enhancement Act

    Dear Representative:

    Since 1919, National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) has been 
the leading voice of the American people in protecting and enhancing 
our National Park System. On behalf of our 1.6 million members and 
supporters nationwide, I want to share our concerns on H.R. 3200--
Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement Act.
    H.R. 3200--Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement Act: NPCA 
appreciates the intent of this legislation, as well as the continued 
efforts of the Committee to ensure America's public lands are 
protected. However, we are concerned H.R. 3200 lacks clarity on the 
visitation data that will be collected, how that information will be 
made available to the public, and undermines Superintendent authority. 
The current budget for the NPS cannot bear the costs and staffing to 
meet the goals outlined in the bill.
    The Visitation Pilot Program as outlined is a massive, resource-
intensive undertaking that requires extensive data collection, 
organization and publication. The Department of the Interior (DOI) and 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) would require new funding to create a 
new, publicly accessible visitation data program that meets a standard 
of excellence visitors can trust when planning their travel and 
recreation. DOI and USDA do not currently have the technical resources 
to collect, organize, analyze or publish visitation data at the scale 
outlined in H.R. 3200. As the Committee has heard before, many parks 
with high visitation are already understaffed and have been dealing 
with flat budgets for a decade. Without additional funding, the 
requirements in this bill are not feasible and Congress cannot 
reasonably expect successful program implementation.
    While the purpose of the Visitation Pilot Program is not explicitly 
stated in the bill, it is presumably intended to disperse visitors 
across federal land recreation destinations in an effort to reduce 
crowd density. Ensuring dispersal techniques are managed properly is a 
complex and challenging endeavor. While visitor dispersal might provide 
some relief to parks experiencing intense crowding, unintended 
consequences of increased visitation in new places adds to management 
burdens and poses long-term threats to park resources. Dispersal as a 
visitor use management strategy must be further studied, and the 
financial and human resource costs must be considered before 
implementation on the scale proposed in this bill.
    Of greatest concern in this bill is Section 4, which limits the 
ability of an NPS superintendent to reduce access to a park unit unless 
there is a risk to health and safety. 36 CFR 1.6 outlines the specific 
circumstances that enable a superintendent to undertake closures. 
Section 4 of this bill creates an unnecessary burden for 
superintendents as they work to protect the resources the parks were 
created to preserve. A park unit can temporarily restrict access to 
areas of a park for a variety of reasons such as migrating fauna, trail 
damage, or research. These types of closures do not pose a risk to 
visitor health and safety, but they are instrumental to ensure the 
protection of irreplaceable park resources. If this bill were to pass 
as it is currently written, park managers would have to go through a 
time consuming NEPA-style public engagement process for simple closures 
that are routinely undertaken. 36 CFR 1.6 ensures that superintendents 
can uphold the Organic Act mandate and act responsively to changing 
conditions. Stripping superintendent authority to make timely closures 
will harm natural and cultural resources and put some of our most 
fragile national treasures at risk.
    If you have any questions or need additional information, please 
contact NPCA's Visitor Experience Program Manager Tucker Johnson 
(tjohnson@npca.org).
    Thank you for considering our views.

            Sincerely,

                                          Christina Hazard,

    Dear Chair Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the 
Subcommittee:

    Thank you for holding September 19th's legislative hearing on 
outdoor recreation. Multiple bills before the subcommittee would 
improve and expand sustainable recreation opportunities across the U.S. 
and provide support to the nation's growing $862 billion outdoor 
recreation economy. We encourage you to advance the bills noted below 
and include them in a first-of-its kind outdoor recreation package in 
2023.
    Outdoor Alliance is a coalition of ten member-based organizations 
representing the human powered outdoor recreation community. The 
coalition includes Access Fund, American Canoe Association, American 
Whitewater, International Mountain Bicycling Association, Winter 
Wildlands Alliance, The Mountaineers, the American Alpine Club, the 
Mazamas, Colorado Mountain Club, and Surfrider Foundation and 
represents the interests of the millions of Americans who climb, 
paddle, mountain bike, backcountry ski and snowshoe, and enjoy coastal 
recreation on our nation's public lands, waters, and snowscapes.
    Outdoor recreation on federal public lands and waters supports 
numerous public health and environmental benefits and helps Americans 
build a lasting connection with their public lands. Recreation also 
provides far-reaching economic benefits, which are particularly 
pronounced for rural communities and others in the vicinity of public 
lands. As these benefits continue to grow alongside overall 
participation in outdoor activities, action from Congress is needed to 
modernize how federal agencies plan for and manage recreational use.
    The bills before the subcommittee would help elevate outdoor 
recreation as a priority across multiple federal agencies, and would 
support needed updates and new initiatives to account for the type, 
extent, and diversity of outdoor recreation activities occurring across 
the U.S. today. The two bills mentioned below--H.R. 3107 and 3200--
closely resemble components of S. 873, America's Outdoor Recreation Act 
(AORA), which recently passed out of the Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee with a unanimous bipartisan vote. We are highly pleased to 
see the subcommittee consider outdoor recreation policy in a similar 
bipartisan manner, and we encourage you to move forward with a 
bipartisan recreation package similar to AORA before the end of the 
year.
    Our comments on specific bills are below.
Improving Outdoor Coordination Act (H.R. 3107)

    Outdoor Alliance supports H.R. 3107, which would make permanent the 
Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation (FICOR). As the 
popularity, diversity, and economic impact of outdoor recreation 
continues to grow, increased attention to recreation management is 
needed across federal agencies. In many cases, the recreation 
experience does not abide by jurisdictional boundaries, and 
recreationists often pass through lands or waters managed by multiple 
agencies during their time outdoors. FICOR can improve coordination 
around recreation management between agencies, and can elevate outdoor 
recreation as a land management priority across the federal government.
    FICOR was renewed in 2022 with overwhelming support from the 
outdoor recreation community. The council's goals include investing in 
recreation infrastructure, expanding outdoor education and career 
development, improving coordination with non-federal partners, and 
improving access to sustainable recreation opportunities on federal 
public lands and waters. H.R. 3107 builds on these existing goals and 
would codify FICOR to provide more permanency and consistency to the 
council's work.
    Outdoor Alliance appreciates the bill sponsors' leadership on this 
issue and respectfully recommends the following changes to H.R. 3107:

    <bullet> Expand the definitions of ``Federal Land Management 
            Agency'' and ``Federal Recreational Lands and Waters'' to 
            include U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National 
            Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These 
            agencies play a critical role in managing recreation lands 
            and waters and recreation infrastructure enjoyed by our 
            community.

    <bullet> Change Sec. 200104(b) to include NOAA in its entirety, 
            rather than just the National Marine Fisheries Service. 
            Multiple departments within NOAA play a role in managing 
            coastal recreation and should be considered by FICOR.

    <bullet> Clarify that FICOR leadership is shared between agencies 
            by removing reference to ``The Secretary'' in 
            Sec. 200104(a).

Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement Act (H.R. 3200)

    Outdoor Alliance supports H.R. 3200, which will help gateway 
communities capitalize on their proximity to recreation amenities in 
building local economies and also establish a digital National Parks 
and Federal Recreation Lands pass. The significance of outdoor 
recreation-related tourism in gateway communities has grown in recent 
years following high levels of participation in outdoor activities 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. As more communities adapt to high levels 
of visitation and invest in their outdoor economies, additional support 
and collaboration from federal land managers can help address housing 
costs, infrastructure needs, workforce development, and other issues 
that can accompany recreation-related economic growth. To accomplish 
this goal, H.R. 3200 requires federal agencies to work with state, 
local, Tribal, and nonprofit partners to create a needs assessment of 
gateway communities, and would provide new pathways for resource 
sharing between the federal government and local communities.
    Outdoor Alliance supports Section 4's intent that local 
stakeholders be notified and have an opportunity to weigh in on 
potential closures of National Parks. We respectfully recommend adding 
the phrase ``or resource conservation concerns'' to the parenthetical 
language in the beginning of this section in order to account for 
potential impacts on sensitive ecological resources.
    We also appreciate Section 5, which improves how federal agencies 
communicate with the public regarding visitation to public lands. 
Current agency reporting makes it difficult for the public--and often 
land managers themselves--to understand the true location, extent, 
seasonality, and timing of recreational use across public lands. 
Innovative approaches like the proposed Real-time Data Pilot Program 
will help agencies adapt their recreation management to better account 
for where and when significant recreational use is occurring, including 
by identifying lesser-known recreation sites.

    Thank you for considering our community's input, and thank you for 
holding this important hearing. We look forward to working with you to 
expand sustainable, high-quality outdoor opportunities across America's 
public lands and waters.

            Best regards,

                                             Louis Geltman,
                 Vice President for Policy and Government Relations

                                 ______
                                 

                         THE WILDERNESS SOCIETY

                                             September 19, 2023    

Hon. Tom Tiffany, Chairman
Hon. Neguse, Ranking Member
Subcommittee on Federal Lands
House Natural Resources Committee
1324 Longworth House Office Building
Washington, DC 20515

    Dear Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the 
House Committee on Natural Resources Subcommittee on Federal Lands:

    On behalf of our more than one million members and supporters, The 
Wilderness Society (TWS) writes to express views on two of the bills 
being considered by the House Committee on Natural Resources 
Subcommittee on Federal Lands during a hearing on September 19, 2023. 
We respectfully request that this letter be included in the hearing 
record.
    In general, we are pleased that the Committee is holding hearings 
on recreation bills that can be incorporated into a House recreation 
package later this year. Doing so moves us closer to getting a bill 
through Congress. Unfortunately, we think two of the bills on today's 
docket will need additional work before they will be ready for 
inclusion in a recreation package. We detail our concerns about both 
bills below.
H.R. 3107--Improving Outdoor Recreation Coordination Act

    TWS supports H.R. 3107 in its goal of making permanent the Federal 
Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation (FICOR). However, we have 
several concerns with the bill as it is currently written. These 
concerns need to be addressed for the FICOR to function effectively and 
achieve its goals.
    TWS joined in the views statement submitted by the Outdoors 
Alliance for Kids (OAK). That statement enumerated our concerns with 
the FICOR bill. We urge the committee to incorporate the changes set 
forth in the OAK views statement when it prepares the FICOR bill for 
markup. We have attached the OAK views statement to this letter.
H.R. 3200--Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement Act

    TWS does not support H.R. 3200 as it is currently written. Our 
concerns with the bill are described in detail below.

Significant unfunded mandates

    Two sections of this bill impose significant unfunded mandates upon 
the agencies:

  1.  Section 3(a) directs the agencies to ``collaborate with State and 
            local governments, Indian Tribes, housing authorities, 
            applicable trade associations, nonprofit organizations, and 
            other relevant stakeholders to identify needs and economic 
            impacts in gateway communities . . .''

  2.  Section 5(b) requires the Secretaries to create a data pilot 
            program that predicts visitation in real time and make that 
            data available to the public through multiple media 
            platforms.

    In both cases, the agencies are instructed to carry out this work 
``using existing funds available to the Secretaries.''
    Both of these tasks are major undertakings that will require 
significant agency resources. The second task in particular will be 
very labor intensive and will require the integration of data sets from 
multiple sources. This will be a challenging technological development 
process. Congress should not require the agencies to take on this work 
with existing funds available. Doing so will force the agencies to 
neglect their other assigned responsibilities in order to comply with 
these mandates. If Congress intends to impose new mandates on the 
agencies, it has a responsibility to provide the additional funding 
necessary to carry out those mandates.

Conflicting signals regarding technical assistance to communities

    Sections 3(b)(1) and 3(b)(2) are internally inconsistent in a way 
that raises questions about the agencies' obligations to provide 
technical assistance to communities. Section 3(b)(1) requires the 
Secretary of Agriculture to provide to businesses in gateway 
communities the assistance described in section 3(b)(2). However, 
section 3(b)(2) says the secretary ``may provide assistance under 
paragraph (1)'' through certain enumerated means. Thus, the bill is 
ambiguous as to whether this assistance is required or is merely 
authorized and discretionary. Congress should resolve this ambiguity 
before taking further action on this bill.

Unrealistic expectations regarding visitor use data

    Section 5(a) requires the agencies to establish a single visitation 
data reporting system that provides an estimate of the number of 
visitors broken down by recreational activity. Developing a unified 
visitation data reporting system would be a significant improvement 
over the current piecemeal system. However, we urge the committee to be 
realistic about the challenges of producing unified data across 
multiple federal land management agencies. This task will difficult for 
several reasons.

  1.  Of the five agencies covered by this bill (BLM, BOR, NPS, USFWS, 
            USFS) only two have entrance gates at which visitors can be 
            counted as they arrive (NPS and USFWS). Two of the five 
            agencies (BLM and USFWS) have completely porous boundaries 
            that make it very difficult to count people upon their 
            arrival.

  2.  Although some NPS and USFWS units have entrance gates at which 
            the agencies are able to count visitors, this data paints 
            an incomplete picture of visitation at Park Service units 
            and Wildlife Refuges. The reason for this because even 
            units with gates have other entry points through which 
            people can gain access without being counted. In addition, 
            some NPS and USFWS have no entrance gates. As a result, 
            visitation data for NPS and USFWS units is, inherently, an 
            underestimation of visitation.

  3.  Because their borders are porous, BLM and USFS must use other 
            methods for measuring visitation. Some of the alternative 
            methods currently being used involve labor intensive field 
            surveys that can only be conducted once every five years. 
            This makes the task of producing unified visitation data on 
            an annual basis more difficult.

    The differences in data collection methodologies and collection 
frequency will make it challenging for the agencies to produce unified 
annual visitation data. Some evolution in the agencies' data collection 
strategies may be required. If so, the two-year deadline imposed by the 
bill is likely unrealistic. For these reasons, we urge the committee to 
revise the bill to give the agencies more time to comply with this 
mandate.
    Thank you for considering our views.

            Sincerely,

                                              Paul Sanford,
                                        Director of Policy Analysis

                               ATTACHMENT

                    Outdoors Alliance for Kids (OAK)

                                             September 19, 2023    

Hon. Tom Tiffany, Chairman
Hon. Neguse, Ranking Member
Subcommittee on Federal Lands
House Natural Resources Committee
1324 Longworth House Office Building
Washington, DC 20515

    Dear Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the 
House Committee on Natural Resources Subcommittee on Federal Lands:

    We, the undersigned members and partners of the Outdoors Alliance 
for Kids (OAK) thank you for prioritizing legislation that improves 
access to the outdoors for children, youth and families. We write to 
express our views in support of H.R. 3107, the Improving Outdoor 
Recreation Coordination Act sponsored by Mr. Neguse and Mr. Lawler, 
although we recommend a series of changes to improve the bill. Our 
recommendations are set forth below.
    OAK is a national strategic partnership of more than 100 businesses 
and organizations representing more than 60 million Americans with a 
common interest in getting young people outdoors playing and learning 
in nature. Our members and supporters believe that the need to increase 
access to the outdoors has never been more apparent.
    OAK supports H.R. 3107 in its goal of making permanent the Federal 
Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation (FICOR). FICOR is a council 
made up of eight federal agencies that manage recreation on federal 
lands and waters. The Council was originally chartered during a 
previous administration and was reestablished through administrative 
action in 2022. Passing legislation that makes the Council permanent 
will ensure that the Council is able to work together to improve 
recreational access over the long term.

    Although we support legislation making FICOR permanent, we have 
several concerns with the bill as it is currently written. These 
concerns need to be addressed for the FICOR to function effectively and 
achieve its goals. Our concerns are as follows:

  1.  H.R. 3107 places the FICOR under the authority of the Department 
            of the Interior. This is inconsistent with the FICOR's 
            current structure and mode of operation under which all 
            four of the member departments have equal authority over 
            the council. This balanced operating structure is essential 
            to ensure equal representation and commitment from each of 
            the FICOR members. We recommend that the Committee amend 
            the language in H.R. 3107 to grant all member agencies 
            equal authority over the FICOR.

  2.  The bill defines ``federal land management agency'' and ``federal 
            recreational lands and waters'' by cross-referencing 
            definitions in the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement 
            Act, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 6801 et seq. (FLREA). These definitions 
            should not be used in H.R. 3107 because they exclude three 
            of the eight FICOR member agencies--the Bureau of Indian 
            Affairs, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
            Administration, and the United States Army Corps of 
            Engineers. We recommend that the Committee formulate 
            definitions for these terms that are specific to H.R. 3107 
            and that include all FICOR member agencies.

  3.  The Department of Commerce agency identified as a FICOR member in 
            section (b)(1) of the bill is different from the current 
            FICOR membership and is not the right agency to represent 
            Commerce on the FICOR. Section (b)(1) identifies the 
            National Marine Fisheries Service as a FICOR member. This 
            is the wrong agency. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
            Administration should be the identified Department of 
            Commerce FICOR representative.

  4.  In addition to the eight federal land and water management 
            agencies, Congress should consider assigning a formal role 
            to two additional agencies within the federal government.

            a.  Assigning a role to the Department of Agriculture's 
        Under Secretary for Rural Development would recognize that 
        outdoor recreation is an important type of rural development 
        that can be cost effective because it does not generally rely 
        on heavily built infrastructure. Bringing USDA Rural 
        Development into the FICOR community should help expand rural 
        development opportunities relating to sustainable outdoor 
        recreation activities.

            b.  Working through its Office of Community Revitalization, 
        EPA runs a technical assistance program to support the 
        recreation economy in rural communities. EPA also manages the 
        Urban Waters Federal Partnership program. Through these 
        programs, EPA plays an important role in the nation's 
        recreation economy. To recognize this, Congress should consider 
        assigning EPA a formal role within the Federal Interagency 
        Council on Outdoor Recreation.

  5.  FICOR representatives have reported to us that rotating the FICOR 
            leadership on an annual basis provides too short of a time 
            frame for effective management of the Council. We recommend 
            amending (b)(4) to rotate leadership among the Council 
            members on an interval to be determined by the Council and 
            not to exceed 3 years.

  6.  The Additional Participants provision in section (b)(2) of the 
            bill identifies specific federal departments and agencies 
            that may be invited to participate in the FICOR meetings 
            and activities. We think this enumerated list is unwise and 
            unnecessary. The goal of collaboration with additional 
            federal agencies can be achieved by using language from 
            section 5(e) of the Memorandum of Understanding 
            establishing the existing FICOR. This MOU language broadly 
            welcomes participation from other federal entities as the 
            FICOR sees fit and does not limit the agencies with which 
            the FICOR may collaborate.

  7.  We recommend that section (b)(3) be revised to address two 
            problems with the bill. First, the bill does not explicitly 
            call out collaboration with Tribal, Territorial or local 
            governments, which is an important part of the Council's 
            work. Second, we believe that section (c)(8), which 
            identifies the FICOR's work with partners outside of the 
            federal government, is too vague and is out of place in its 
            current location in the bill. To address these issues, we 
            recommend expanding section (b)(3) ``State Coordination'' 
            to read as follows:

            (3)  Other Coordination.--In determining additional 
        participants under this subsection, the Secretaries may----

                    (A)  invite participation in the Council's meetings 
                or other activities from representatives of State, 
                Tribal, Territorial, and local governments.

                    (B)  build partnerships between the parties and a 
                range of private, public, Tribal, and non-profit 
                entities.

  8.  Section (c)(1) specifically calls out the implementation of the 
            FLREA as one of the purposes of the Council's work. As 
            explained above, three of the FICOR agencies are not 
            covered by FLREA. We recommend revising this statement to 
            cover existing and future policies more broadly in a manner 
            similar to the FICOR MOU. This can be accomplished by 
            changing the language of section (c)(1) to read:

            (1)  recreation management policies across Federal 
        agencies, including implementation of new and existing 
        recreation legislation;

  9.  Finally, it is essential that Congress identify a sustainable and 
            reliable funding source for FICOR operations and 
            operational capacity. Without it, the Council will not 
            succeed. Expecting the agencies to absorb the operating 
            costs of the Council without an identified funding source 
            is simply unrealistic. Congress should address this issue 
            in H.R. 3107.

    For questions related to this views statement, contact Paul 
Sanford, OAK Vice Chair and Director of Policy Analysis at The 
Wilderness Society. Mr. Sanford can be reached at psanford@tws.org.
    Thank you for the opportunity to submit our views on H.R. 3107. We 
look forward to working with the Committee to improve and pass this 
vital piece of recreation legislation.

            Sincerely,

                                 [OAK member organizations]
