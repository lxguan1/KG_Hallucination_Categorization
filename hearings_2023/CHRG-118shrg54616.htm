                                                    Washington, DC.

        OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, CHAIRMAN,
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Chairman Tester. I am going to call this hearing to order. 
Good afternoon. I want to start by thanking Dr. Elnahal and 
Josh Jacobs for being here today to discuss VA's implementation 
of the PACT Act.
    It was about a year ago that we came together to pass the 
bipartisan Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our 
PACT Act. It was a historic bill. It was a long-overdue victory 
for toxic-exposed veterans and their families. Now it is on the 
VA to implement this law as seamlessly as possible, which is 
not an easy task because it tends to be pretty popular.
    And that is why I held several town hall meetings 
throughout Montana to hear firsthand from veterans about what 
they have been experiencing. And what I hear, which I think 
most of my colleagues on this Committee are also hearing, is 
that the expansion of health care benefits has been well 
received by toxic-exposed veterans and their families.
    VA has received more than 744,000 claims for the PACT Act 
benefits, and has completed more than 409,000 PACT Act claims, 
approving about 80 percent of them. More than 103,000 veterans 
with PACT Act-related eligibility have enrolled in the VA 
health care system. VA estimates more than 3.8 million veterans 
who were already enrolled in the VA system were impacted by the 
PACT Act.
    To ensure the VA is effectively serving all veterans 
following the increase in demand for its programs and services, 
the PACT Act also invested in VA's infrastructure and 
workforce. The VA has leveraged these tools to hire more than 
43,000 new staff to process claims and provide health care, 
work toward opening 31 new clinics and research facilities in 
19 different States and use technology to streamline the claims 
process and tackle the significant increase in PACT Act claims.
    But our efforts are only as good as VA's success in getting 
the word out to every potential affected veteran and survivor. 
During today's hearing I would like to hear about the 
Department's efforts to reach disadvantaged populations like 
veterans in rural Montana who still lack access to broadband 
and do not have reliable cellphone service. It is also 
critically important VA works to make its website easy to find 
and even easier to navigate. I heard over and over again from 
veterans who say the VA website are complicated and 
unnecessarily so. For example, the Burn Pits Registry needs to 
be more streamlined and easier to use.
    However, much is working as planned. I am pleased that the 
VA is using the PACT Act framework for researching and 
determining the health impacts of the toxic exposures to decide 
whether it should expand benefits to veterans who suffer from 
leukemia and myeloma. My hope is that VA will continue to do 
the same with other exposures such as contaminated water at Red 
Hill, the high rate of cancer among missileers who served at 
Malmstrom Air Force Base, and other global strike command 
locations.
    I look forward to hearing from you, Dr. Elnahal and Mr. 
Jacobs, on how you plan to tackle these and other challenges 
you have encountered during the past year while you have 
implemented the bill that we passed, the PACT Act.
    With that I will turn it over to Ranking Member Jerry Moran 
for his opening statement.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JERRY MORAN,
            RANKING MEMBER, U.S. SENATOR FROM KANSAS

    Senator Moran. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Thank you for 
holding this hearing. Thank you for the efforts that this 
Committee went through in regard to enactment of the Sergeant 
First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our PACT Act, which was 
signed into law now a year ago.
    I am going to say some of the same thing that you said but 
certainly not as articulately as you did.
    Dr. Elnahal and Dr. Jacobs, you have each had an important 
task in implementing the PACT Act over the last year. We 
recognize the challenges. We talked about them as one of our 
concerns from the very beginning is how does the VA implement 
this major piece of legislation in a way that takes care of the 
veterans that we want to include but does not do anything 
damaging to those who are already part of the system. And we 
know, recognizing the challenges, but recognize that the 
benefits that come from creating these new benefits we think 
outweigh the challenges and the detriments that might come to 
others.
    This legislation, the PACT Act, impacts virtually every 
aspect of the Department's operation, delivering health care 
and benefits and leasing VA medical facilities, conducting 
research into toxic exposures, and recruiting and retaining 
employees at the VA. Congress gave the VA a number of tools to 
expand the services available to toxic-exposed veterans and 
their survivors, and we want to help you accomplish that goal.
    I do have some concerns or questions that I would raise. 
One of the tools we gave the VA is a 1-year open enrollment for 
post-9/11 combat veterans who separated from service more than 
10 years ago. That deadline is rapidly approaching. I have 
concerns. I just want to be reassured that the VA has not 
sufficiently informed this group--let me say that in a positive 
way. I want to make sure that those individuals have been 
informed and have the opportunity to enroll before the time is 
up.
    I also would like to be reassured that the VA is adequately 
tracking how many veterans are enrolling in the VA health care 
system due to the PACT Act, and I remain concerned about the 
impact the PACT Act is having on the backlog for veterans and 
survivors, toxic exposure or not, and we want to make sure that 
wait times should not be a second longer than necessary in 
receiving benefits. I would like to hear how the VBA is staying 
on top of the backlog and using resources Congress provided to 
work through these claims quickly, without loss of the quality 
of claim decisions.
    We continue to hear--I continue to hear from veterans who 
have been exposed to toxins in locations or circumstances not 
included in the PACT Act. This could be veterans who were 
exposed to burn pits in Kosovo or herbicides in Panama.
    A key aspect of the PACT Act was directing the VA to carry 
out a fair and transparent process to identify, evaluate, and 
grant presumptions for additional toxic exposures and related 
diseases not spelled out specifically in the legislation. The 
VA, CDC, the National Academies have expertise and now the 
congressional mandate to listen to veterans, to act to address 
their toxic exposure-related health concerns as needed.
    I was glad to see the VA announced this week that the 
Department is going to use the new PACT Act process to consider 
three additional new presumptions. I hope to hear from our 
witnesses, from you today, more about that and about additional 
conditions the VA may be considering through the next framework 
in this process.
    As the PACT Act made clear, caring for veterans who are 
sick and suffering or may become so as a result of toxic 
exposures they experienced in the military is a moral 
imperative for the VA and for this Committee. The men and women 
who were exposed to Agent Orange, burn pit smoke, radiation, 
and other dangerous toxins deserve nothing less.
    I look forward to hearing how I and this Committee can be 
of help to you in accomplishing the goals that we mutually 
share in the implementation of the PACT Act. And Mr. Chairman, 
I yield back.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Senator Moran. I appreciate 
those comments.
    Today's hearing has one panel with two leaders responsible 
for implementing the PACT Act. First we have Dr. Shereef 
Elnahal, who is the Under Secretary for Health. He has been in 
front of this Committee numerous times this year. Thank you for 
coming back again.
    Next we have Josh Jacobs, who is the Under Secretary for 
Benefits. Josh, we appreciate you being here in a confirmed 
position in a big, big way, so thank you.
    We are going to start with your statement, Dr. Elnahal, and 
then we will move to Mr. Jacobs for his statement. You have the 
floor, Dr. Elnahal.

      STATEMENT OF HON. SHEREEF ELNAHAL, MD, MBA, UNDER
       SECRETARY FOR HEALTH, DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AF-
       FAIRS

    Dr. Elnahal. Thank you very much, Chairman, Ranking Member 
Moran, and other Members of the Committee. Under Secretary for 
Benefits, Josh Jacobs, and I thank you for the opportunity to 
appear before you today to discuss the Department of Veterans 
Affairs' implementation of the PACT Act. This landmark 
legislation has already empowered VA to provide more care and 
more benefits to more veterans than ever before, as well as 
their caregivers and survivors.
    One of those veterans is Wendell Griffin. Mr. Griffin was 
exposed to toxins while stationed in Thailand in the early 
1970s, and had developed several related health conditions. On 
January 1st of this year, thanks to the PACT Act, Mr. Griffin 
was granted service connection, and today we are providing him 
all the care he needs to manage his Parkinson's disease, 
diabetes mellitus type 2, and peripheral neuropathy, and the 
change is noticeable. He said, quote, ``It used to be that what 
we got was a small amount of VA care. Now I can go in and ask 
for what I need, and they provide it.'' Mrs. Griffin adds that 
these expanded benefits provide much needed financial relief so 
that they can focus on her husband's health. This is why we do 
what we do at VA, and we are committed to fighting for Mr. 
Griffin and the hundreds of thousands of veterans now covered 
by the PACT Act.
    Since the passage of the legislation we have launched an 
aggressive outreach campaign to encourage veterans to apply for 
benefits and get their toxic exposure screenings. Alongside Mr. 
Jacobs and our partners at VBA we have hosted more than 2,000 
PACT Act outreach events across the country. And as we approach 
two important deadlines, the end of the special enrollment 
period and the last day to submit a claim to have it backdated 
to August of last year, we are hosting another 125 events at 
facilities across the Nation this summer during our Summer Vet 
Fest.
    We have also placed heavy emphasis on training our teams to 
better serve veterans impacted by toxic exposures. As of July 
10, 2023, over 140,000 clinicians completed mandatory VA 
military exposure training, and over 45,000 employees have 
participated in PACT Act 101 training. Further, we trained more 
than 88,000 providers from across disciplines to perform toxic 
exposure screenings and recently screened our four-millionth 
veteran for exposures during their service.
    As we welcome new veterans and provide more care to those 
already in our system we are also focused on building capacity 
to meet veteran care needs through hiring, improvements to 
access, and expansion of our infrastructure. Thanks in large 
part to the new hiring authorities in the law, our health care 
system's total workforce has grown by 4.9 percent through June, 
the highest growth rate in over 15 years. We hired almost 
44,000 new employees this fiscal year alone and have also 
improved retention. We are continuing to improve the hiring 
process to reduce the time it takes to onboard folks into 
vacant positions, and we are focused on that diligently.
    And as we continue to grow our team, we are working our 
hardest to improve access. This year we are already outpacing 
goals for hiring medical support assistance and other critical 
support staff. We are also working on improving our scheduling 
systems for both direct and community care, to have better 
visibility into provider schedules and ease the workflow for 
staff, all while empowering veterans to schedule appointments 
directly with community providers themselves. Further, we are 
standardizing appointment links and expectations for bookable 
hours to optimize the time our clinicians spend in clinic.
    To accommodate the future needs of veterans as a result of 
the PACT Act we are also seeking to leverage PACT Act 
authorities to expand our physical infrastructure. Recently we 
entered into memorandums of understanding with some of our 
academic affiliates that will lead to new clinical space that 
will serve veterans.
    For veterans who receive health care because of the PACT 
Act, I want to highlight that today, for the first time ever, 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services included VA 
facilities in their annual overall hospital star ratings, and I 
am very proud to share that 67 percent of our facilities 
received either four or five stars, compared to only 41 percent 
of non-VA hospitals.
    The excellence of our system and the success of PACT Act 
implementation would not be possible without the trust of 
veterans, the dedication of our employees, and our partnership 
with all of you. So I want to thank this Committee and Congress 
as a whole for the authorities we have to provide more care and 
more benefits to veterans and the tools and the budgetary 
resources necessary to do so.
    The importance of robust funding in the last omnibus and 
the hiring and infrastructure authorities granted in the PACT 
Act cannot be understated. As we build on the success of last 
year we appreciate your support for fully funding the VA budget 
request and your efforts to make VA more competitive through 
the VA CAREERS Act.
    Chairman Tester, Ranking Member Moran, thank you again for 
the opportunity to appear before you today and for your 
continued support. We look forward to your questions.

    [The joint statement of Dr. Elnahal and Mr. Jacobs appear 
on page 29 of the Appendix.]

    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Dr. Elnahal, and there will be 
questions.
    Mr. Jacobs, you have the floor.

       STATEMENT OF HON. JOSHUA D. JACOBS, UNDER SECRETARY 
          FOR BENEFITS, DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

    Mr. Jacobs. Good afternoon, Chairman Tester, Ranking Member 
Moran, and Members of the Committee. I appreciate the 
opportunity to appear before you to discuss VA's ongoing 
implementation of the PACT Act. It has been nearly 1 year since 
Congress passed and President Biden signed the PACT Act into 
law, and more than 7 months since VBA started full 
implementation of the law.
    The new benefits provided under the PACT Act and our 
aggressive sustained outreach efforts to connect veterans and 
survivors with those benefits have resulted in an increasing 
number of veterans pursuing their earned benefits. Veterans and 
their survivors have filed more than 772,000 PACT Act-related 
claims since August 10th, and thanks to the efforts of our 
dedicated staff, 425,000 of those claims have been completed, 
with a nearly 79 percent approval rate for PACT Act-related 
claims. And as we work through each and every incoming claim, 
we are reminded that behind each claim is a veteran, family 
member, or survivor.
    Dr. Elnahal told you about Wendell and the care he receives 
from the VA health care system. Wendell initially pursued 
service connection for Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and 
peripheral neuropathy in 2016, due to exposure to Agent Orange 
while he was stationed in Thailand in the early 1970s. His 
previous claims and appeals were denied because we did not have 
sufficient evidence to provide him a grant of benefits through 
direct service connection, and his service in Thailand was not 
considered a presumptive.
    But that all changed with the PACT Act. Wendell filed his 
claim, and on January 1, 2023, was granted 100 percent service 
connection for 13 disabilities and dependents' educational 
assistance. Not only will these earned benefits provide long-
overdue recognition of the service and sacrifice made by 
Wendell, but they will also provide access to other life-
changing benefits and health care for him and his wife, who 
helps care for him.
    Wendell is one of the many veterans who benefited from this 
historic bipartisan law, and we were able to deliver these 
long-overdue benefits because of the authorities and funding 
provided by Congress as well as our decision to make all 
presumptives effective the day the bill was signed into law 
rather than over several years, to start processing all PACT 
claims on January 1st, instead of waiting 18 to 24 months for 
regulations, because of the planning, coordination, and months 
of hard work that have gone into the implementation, and most 
importantly because of the talented and mission-focused VBA 
colleagues who help deliver on the promise of a grateful 
Nation.
    To ensure timely service to veterans like Wendell, VBA has 
been aggressively hiring. Even before President Biden signed 
the PACT Act into law, VA began actively hiring new employees 
to prepare for the expansion of benefits, and over the last 18 
months, VBA has grown by 22 percent, with a total end strength 
of more than 30,000 people. We have also been scaling up our 
examination capacity. Through the end of June, we have 
completed 1.9 million exams, which is a nearly 22 percent 
increase over the same time last year.
    And while we have much to celebrate, our implementation has 
not been without challenges. For example, we have heard about 
the need to streamline and revise the PACT Act training, about 
the complexity of applying the new Toxic Exposure Risk Activity 
(TERA) requirements in the law, and about the pressure that has 
been experienced by our hard-working claims processors who are 
doing their best to learn the nuances of this once-in-a-
generation legislation while continuing to meet their 
production and quality standards.
    And we are using that feedback to make improvements to our 
PACT training, to develop tools to help employees make uniform 
and consistent decisions regarding the application of TERA, by 
providing our claims processors with the relief they need to 
adjust to the new requirements, and by increasingly leveraging 
automated tools to make our employees more effective and 
efficient.
    The PACT Act is the biggest expansion of health care and 
benefits for veterans in generations, and it provides 
groundbreaking coverage of more than 300 conditions. But we 
know it is not and cannot be the end, and that is why we are 
telling all veterans who think they may be eligible for PACT 
benefits to submit an intent to file by August 9th in order to 
preserve the earliest possible effective date. And it is why we 
cannot rest until we understand whether there is a connection 
between other deadly conditions and the service of our Nation's 
heroes.
    We will continue to search for answers through our forward-
leaning scientific research efforts and the analysis of claims 
data, and we will use the new presumptive decision-making 
process, codified in the PACT Act, to formally consider whether 
we can establish new presumptive conditions.
    In addition to the many direct benefits provided to 
veterans and survivors, the PACT Act has also fostered greater 
collaboration and jointness across the Department. Whether 
through our joint outreach efforts, the presumptive decision-
making process, data-sharing, or other key initiatives, the 
PACT Act has required all of VA, and particularly VBA and VHA, 
to work together in new and more collaborative ways, and I look 
forward to continuing to work with Dr. Elnahal to make this the 
new normal so we can better support the men and women we are 
privileged to serve.
    Thank you for your continued support of veterans, their 
families, caregivers, and survivors. I look forward to your 
questions.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you both for your testimony. I 
appreciate it very much. I will start.
    We are here on the PACT Act, but I want to go a little 
parochial for a second because there are issues that are 
happening in the Montana VA. Recently, the VA announced a 
comprehensive review of VA Montana, which is consistent with 
calls that I have made via letter hearings and direct 
conversation with you and Secretary McDonough, Dr. Elnahal. I 
think you saw some of those concerns when you were out and 
visited Montana last December.
    So for you, Dr. Elnahal, what can veterans and VA employees 
in Montana expect as this comprehensive review gets underway?
    Dr. Elnahal. Thank you, Chairman. We are very focused on 
the many issues affecting VA Montana, but the first thing I 
want to say is that veterans in Montana should continue to seek 
care there. We are working our hardest to make sure that care 
is the highest quality possible. That is what veterans in 
Montana deserve.
    And the issues that have surfaced, the investigations by 
the OIG and most recently our Office of the Medical Inspector, 
were not issues that I could sit on. So I have worked with the 
network director over VISN 19 to ensure that two very talented 
senior executives in our system came into that facility, 
diagnosed all of the issues, and began the process to address 
them systematically, Wade Vlosich and Wayne Gill, whom I spoke 
with personally this week to ensure that we are on the same 
page and that each issue is surfaced and addressed. That is 
what the veterans in Montana deserve, and I know you equally 
care for that facility to get on the right path, Chairman.
    Chairman Tester. It is critically important it does. Can 
you give me any kind of an idea about how long you anticipate 
this takes, or is that not a question you can answer at this 
moment in time?
    Dr. Elnahal. I think at a high level, Chairman, as long as 
it takes to correct the issues, but I do hope that we get 
better insight into the exact plan of action on each of them 
over the next couple of months, and we will keep in touch with 
you and your staff throughout that entire process.
    Chairman Tester. You answered part of my second question, 
and that is can I get a commitment from you that VA Montana 
will get the resources and support that it needs from VA 
Central Office as this review goes on?
    Dr. Elnahal. I commit to that, Senator.
    Chairman Tester. And beyond.
    Dr. Elnahal. Absolutely.
    Chairman Tester. All right. Thank you.
    Mr. Jacobs, as I predicted, the PACT Act has been very 
popular. Veterans have been waiting generations, if not 
centuries, for these benefits. That said, 744,000 PACT Act 
claims, and 1.3 million non-PACT claims is a bunch to handle. I 
know your team has hired thousands of claim processors to deal 
with the influx of claims, as you pointed out, yet we hear from 
some in VBA that VA is so focused on production quotas that it 
risks reducing the quality of the claims decision.
    So how are you balancing the need for the quick process 
with the unprecedented level of workload while maintaining high 
quality?
    Mr. Jacobs. Thanks very much for that question, and I will 
tell you, that is a question that I get at every regional 
office that I visit. It is a constant tension in a production-
oriented environment to deliver timely benefits to veterans, 
particularly in an environment where more and more veterans are 
coming, seeking the benefits that they have earned while 
delivering them in a quality and accurate manner. And so the 
bottom line is, it is not either/or. It is both/and.
    And I will add to the two dimensions that you have 
mentioned, which is timeliness and quality. We are adding a 
third, which is veteran experience. We can deliver a timely, 
high-quality decision, but if the veteran does not feel 
respected, if they feel like they have been ignored, that could 
be the difference between them pursuing other earned benefits 
or turning their back and not coming back to VA.
    So, the way that we balance it is with our performance 
standards. We have high performance standards that measure both 
production and quality, and we constantly are reevaluating them 
to make sure that they are delivering the right outcomes that 
we have designed.
    Chairman Tester. Okay. Dr. Elnahal, I am encouraged by the 
VA's hiring successes. Part of that is your good work. Part of 
it is the tools we gave you in PACT. There are some provisions 
that have not been implemented, some, in fact, that I have 
championed. Can you provide an update on VA's national rural 
hiring strategy?
    Dr. Elnahal. Yes, Chairman. That report and that guidance 
cannot come soon enough to the field. We are working very hard 
on that. We hope to get that guidance out to the field in the 
fall. And that is an intensive effort that is happening with 
multiple research components of our organization but also our 
workforce management infrastructure as well.
    We have 12 VISNs involved who mostly represent rural areas, 
have largely rural populations within their VISNs, contributing 
directly to this, so it has field input as well as the 
expertise of our efforts over these particular areas.
    So, I do think this will be a good product, and it will 
provide direct, useful guidance to our rural-serving VA 
facilities.
    Chairman Tester. One quick question, final question, before 
I turn to Senator Moran. Where are you with the contract buyout 
provision?
    Dr. Elnahal. We have implemented it, Chairman. In other 
words, it is available to the field. The uptake is not nearly 
as much as I had hoped right now, to be candid with you. We 
have less than 10 providers who we have bought their contracts 
at this point. So, I am going to double back and see why uptake 
is not greater because I do think this should be much more 
robust.
    Chairman Tester. Okay. Senator Moran.
    Senator Moran. Chairman, thank you. Dr. Elnahal, the 1-year 
enrollment period for post-9/11 combat veterans who left 
military more than a decade ago, do not have a service-
connected condition, and make above VA income limits will end 
on September 30, 2023, about 2 months from now. How many of 
those veterans were not enrolled in the VA health care system 
when the PACT Act was enacted, and how many of them have 
enrolled since the 1-year open enrollment period started 
October 1, 2022?
    Dr. Elnahal. We estimate, Senator, that it is in the 
hundreds of thousands of veterans who could potentially qualify 
for the 1-year special enrollment. Right now we just got 
critical updates to our health care enrollment eligibility 
system that will shed light on a much more precise number of 
folks who took advantage of that particular window of 
eligibility. Right now we can only estimate.
    What I can tell you is overall over 100,000 veterans in the 
outreach population that we defined right after the passage of 
the PACT Act have enrolled. Once we get more precision in that 
data we will present it to you and react to it. We do have 
until September 30th, so we are going to work very, very hard 
to maximize the opportunity. And I have been frustrated, 
frankly, with how long it is taking to get some precision on 
folks who are taking advantage of that specific authority. But 
once we surface that information we can be much more targeted 
on our outreach.
    And I will just say that over 2,000 outreach events, 
Senator, including over 100 early this summer alone. We are 
messaging to those veterans in a broad way to come in. But we 
need to be much more targeted in our outreach, and we will make 
sure we do that.
    Senator Moran. Anything that I or we can do to be of help 
to you? I also think Congress has a role to play in messaging 
and outreach. If you have any suggestions of how we can help 
you find or veterans find you that fit this category in the 
next 2 months, please put me to work.
    Dr. Elnahal. The more you and your offices amplify that 
window of opportunity for vets who separated more than 10 years 
ago, the post-9/11 vets, to directly enroll in VA health care, 
the better. We are trying to amplify that message as much as 
possible, so thank you for that.
    Chairman Tester. Jerry, if I might just add, there are 
opportunities out there for PSAs that some of the Veterans 
Service Organizations are asking us to do. I just got one 
yesterday.
    Senator Moran. That is good. I assume we know that. That is 
good to have it broadcast and into my brain. I am always 
looking forward to the opportunity for you to tell me what I 
can do.
    Chairman Tester. No. Just opportunities to see you 
successful.
    Senator Moran. Mr. Jacobs, this is a question you and I 
have talked about before, and it is the Ready for Decision 
title that a veteran receives and then waits and waits and 
waits for an answer. Ready for Decision generally means 
something is around the corner. How is the VA working across 
the VA to better communicate to veterans, survivors, and other 
stakeholders about where a claim is in the process of being 
decided and manage expectations for how long an individual will 
have to wait for that final decision?
    Mr. Jacobs. Yes. Thank you very much, and I appreciate you 
raising this issue. When we last spoke, the Ready for Decision 
inventory was significantly higher. The team has done an 
incredible job of bringing that down. We actually have a 
different problem that we are working to manage, is to make 
sure that we have enough claims in the Ready for Decision file 
to execute on because we have so many coming in that are in the 
evidence stage.
    One of the things that we are doing is we are working with 
our Veteran Experience Office to work to do human-centered 
design engagements and make sure that as we communicate we are 
simplifying that.
    We had a PACT Act offsite. One of the things we have done 
over the last year is we have held four quarterly offsites to 
make sure that we are talking through implementation. We got 
direct feedback from our Veterans Service Organizations 
partners that were in the room as well as staff from the 
Committee about how we go about doing that. And so, it is 
updates to not only the website but also to the call centers, 
and making clear, in a less bureaucratic manner, what this 
means.
    The challenge for us is providing a clear expectation for 
how long an individual claim may proceed. Because we can talk 
averages, but we know averages include outliers. And so, trying 
to provide precision and a common expectation and understanding 
without over-promising and under-delivering.
    Senator Moran. Is that label still of value? Ready for 
Decision still is something that should be being said to a 
veteran?
    Mr. Jacobs. No. In fact, that is one of the things that we 
are looking at. We are looking at changing the nomenclature. It 
means something to people who process claims and know the 
process. It means something very different, to your point, to 
veterans who are going through the process.
    So, one of the key decisions that we are working to make is 
how we communicate where you are in that process. We have got 
multiple stages in the process, so we are trying to cut it down 
to maybe five and change the language to be clearer.
    Senator Moran. That is a good point for me to recognize, is 
this was really intended for internal use.
    Mr. Jacobs. Correct.
    Senator Moran. It became used externally and created an 
expectation that is difficult to meet.
    Mr. Jacobs. Yes. And I think that is one of the biggest 
takeaways here for me, in the past year. We have an incredibly 
knowledgeable and mission-oriented staff who have been doing 
this, in some cases, for decades, and they all want to do the 
right thing. But sometimes we forget, and our focus on the day-
to-day, that what makes sense to us does not make sense to 
everyone else outside of our building. So that is why it is so 
important for us to work externally, to open it up to talk 
about what we are doing, and to get input, both from the 
veterans and our external partners who can provide that 
impartial feedback.
    Senator Moran. Thank you. Let me thank both of you in this 
hearing, particularly on the PACT Act, recognizing the 
tremendous increase in work, you and your teams. I have had 
significant faith in both of you, Mr. Jacobs, Dr. Elnahal, from 
the moment I met you, when you were nominated to your 
confirmation hearing and the hearings in between. And I am glad 
to have you both in the circumstance that you are, in the 
positions that you are in, to lead us forward to get this 
right. So thank you very much.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Senator Moran. Senator Brown.

                      HON. SHERROD BROWN,
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO

    Senator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for 
your work on the PACT Act, and this is how government should 
operate. When this Committee does its work and addresses a 
problem we get together, under Senator Tester's leadership. A 
lot of us worked on this bill. It passed in August. Already I 
know, talking to VA employees and VA leaders prior to passage, 
who were already planning on its passage and began to scale up. 
Passage was signed in August, ready in January. Thousands of 
veterans went to the VA in Chillicothe, in Dayton, in 
Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus, and got those benefits, if 
they presented with any of the 23 illnesses, and that is the 
way it should work. So our job on this Committee, and other 
Members of the Senate and the VA, is to make sure that veterans 
know about this.
    Since its passage, or right before, around the time of its 
passage, since before it began to take effect, I began to do 
roundtables in Ohio with Tom Wike, a staff person who is here 
today, in Ohio, a veteran himself. We have done 35 roundtables. 
Ohio has the good fortune of being one of the States that has a 
Veteran Service Office in all 88 counties. So I sat with the 
veteran service officer from that county, some of their staff. 
Some of those county VSOs are as small as two employees. Some 
are as large as Cleveland and Columbus, with 40 or 50 
employees. Usually meet at a VFW or American Legion hall or 
other veteran organizations and talk to the community. We will 
have 10 or 15 or 20 veterans sitting around a table, and their 
job, because they are active in veteran organizations, is to 
get the word out.
    So thank you for the work that you do. Twenty-four thousand 
veterans in Ohio have already submitted PACT Act claims. I 
would encourage the VA to continue to be creative about your 
outreach, particularly looking at how to reach veterans who are 
not connected to the VA. We have talked in this Committee a 
number of times about the disconnect between active service, 
coming home. The VA does not really know where they are. They 
do not connect with the VA because they do not think about it. 
And then when they need help we need to be there. So just an 
opening statement, if I could.
    Secretary Elnahal, I heard from a constituent this week in 
northeast Ohio, Cleveland, Akron, Lorain, Lake County area, who 
lost her husband a month ago to pancreatic cancer that was 
likely connected to his service in Desert Storm in Iraq. The 
husband went in for his toxic exposure screening but was not 
referred for any diagnostic testing until he became visibly 
ill. When he finally was referred for testing they found stage 
IV pancreatic cancer, but it was too late.
    So my question, Mr. Elnahal is, after a veteran receives a 
toxic exposure screening, walk me through the steps taken to 
get that veteran to follow-up care as quickly as possible. How 
do we make sure that that transition to care happens as quickly 
as it should?
    Dr. Elnahal. Thank you for the question, Senator Brown. I 
want to express my deep concern, condolences for the veteran 
you are talking about.
    You know, we have had too many cases over the years which, 
frankly, led to the expansion of coverage for cancers like 
pancreatic cancers associated with toxic burn pits, as the 
legislation establishes. So we have now screened more than four 
million veterans across the country for toxic exposures. It is 
a standard questionnaire, happening in every primary care 
clinic increasingly more types of clinics like mental health 
and specialty care.
    And should a veteran indicate that they have been exposed 
to one of these toxins they are then referred to a stage 2 
screening, which allows us to understand better what their 
specific concerns are, their current diagnoses are canvassed, 
and we call this exposure-informed care because we have now 
trained tens of thousands of clinicians to do the screening, 
but over 140,000 clinicians who treat veterans on what these 
exposures might mean for future conditions.
    So, in other words, it alters the care in a beneficial way. 
It allows us to anticipate conditions associated with these 
exposures. And very importantly, we have an excellent 
relationship with Under Secretary Jacobs' team, whereby every 
veteran is supposed to get a letter directly from the Veterans 
Benefits Administration to encourage vets to apply for further 
benefits, even if they are already enrolled.
    I do not know if my colleague wants to describe further.
    Mr. Jacobs. Yes. We are continuing to find more creative 
ways, and to your earlier question about outreach. And what I 
would add is we have a data-driven process where we are able to 
identify the percentage of veterans that are accessing their 
earned benefits on a county-by-county basis, and that is one of 
the reasons, I think, why we have been successful. In Ohio we 
have had, I think, 139 events, and then we are trying to target 
our resources as effectively as possible.
    Chairman Tester. Senator Tuberville.

                     HON. TOMMY TUBERVILLE,
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ALABAMA

    Senator Tuberville. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for 
being here today, both of you. Thanks for what you do for our 
veterans.
    We talked earlier about people--you can have all the money 
you want, but if you do not have the people working for you it 
is not going to work. We all know that. We all know the 
situation we are in right now, looking to hire people. But with 
all the disability claims and the demand for veterans seeking 
care it has got to be unbelievable.
    So the PACT Act provided numerous hiring authorities for 
the VA, including incentives such as student loan repayment and 
signing bonuses. However, I continue to see reports of burnout, 
and you are going to have burnout in everything, amongst your 
employees.
    But this is for both of you. While I understand the VBA is 
onboarding employees daily, combined with the burnout rate, are 
we netting employees? Are we gaining ground? Both of you.
    Mr. Jacobs. Yes. I will say we have grown by 22 percent 
over the last 18 months. We started at about 24,000-plus 
employees 18 months ago. We are now at 30,000. We have never 
been at this place in terms of the total workforce.
    And at the same time that we are continuing to recruit and 
hire and onboard and train, we are also very focused on 
retention. And so, we have an attrition rate of about 6 
percent. It is a little bit lower than it has been 
historically. And part of the reason we are very focused on it 
is if we bring in all these new employees and we lose all of 
our experienced employee it is going to do no one any good.
    This is a workforce who has been doing an incredible job. 
We are 16 percent above where we were last year in terms of 
total production, but that comes at a cost.
    Senator Tuberville. Mr. Elnahal?
    Dr. Elnahal. And I will just add, Senator, that hiring 
faster and more competitively is my most important foundational 
priority. We have to execute this legislation to its fullest 
extent. We cannot do that without enough people. So I am 
pleased to report that we have grown by almost 5 percent across 
our total workforce. We are on pace to exceed 400,000 VA health 
care employees for the first time. And as a result of both the 
combined focus on hiring but also retention, because of the 
safety culture we are trying to establish with high 
reliability, lifting the focus of our clinicians and the voices 
of our clinicians in addressing things like burnout, we have 
been able to retain employees at much higher levels than in the 
past several years, especially in the context of the pandemic.
    So I think all of that accounts for our success so far, but 
we are not taking our foot off the gas. We still have a goal of 
hiring 52,000 external hires this fiscal year ending September 
30th. We have already hired more than 43,000, so we are on pace 
to beat it, but we will not stop until we do. And then we have 
to hire strategically more and more to be able to execute this.
    Senator Tuberville. So the increase, how does that compare 
to the last 5 years, before we started the PACT Act? Is it the 
same? Better? The increase.
    Mr. Jacobs. This is the fastest and the most explosive 
growth we have ever had in the last 20 years, is my 
understanding.
    Dr. Elnahal. We have hired more people this fiscal year, in 
the first 9 months, than we ever have in the agency's history 
in the health care system, and it is the highest total employee 
onboard growth rate in more than 15 years.
    Senator Tuberville. So what is the VBA onboarding rate for 
hiring outside the VA versus hiring within the VA, given that 
hiring from within the VA creates more vacancies to fill? I 
mean, how does that work? How is that working? Both of you.
    Mr. Jacobs. I will have to get back with specific number 
for the record, but what I will say is we have been very 
intentional about hiring externally, and those numbers have 
increased.
    But the point you are making is a good one. As an example, 
we staff our call centers with a lot of incredible workers. 
They have taken advantage of these hiring opportunities to 
pursue career growth. They are going to be veteran service 
representatives. That creates an opening that we then have to 
backfill, particularly in our call centers, but we are mindful 
of that. We are also mindful of changing the culture so that we 
are more expansive in considering the types of skill sets that 
could be successful doing this type of work. And I will get you 
the specifics.
    Dr. Elnahal. And I have directed my team, Senator, to only 
count external hires, for the exact reason you just mentioned. 
So the 43,000 number is external hires into the system.
    Senator Tuberville. You said 43,000?
    Dr. Elnahal. Yes, 43,000 since October 1st of last year.
    Senator Tuberville. Man. Our unemployment rate ought to be 
going down with all you all are hiring. That is unbelievable.
    I am out of time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
VA Response:
 
Through July 29, 2023, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) has
 seen a near even split of internal and external VA hires in fiscal year
 (FY) 2023.
 
In FY 2023, VBA has hired 9,320 employees. The following provides a
 breakdown of the hiring:
<bullet> 50% (4,641) were external to VA
<bullet> 19% (1,786) were internal transfers to VBA from other VA
 offices or administrations
<bullet> 31% (2,893) were internal movements within VBA
 
The total hires from outside VBA (6,427) is proportionate to 25% of
 VBA's personnel count at the beginning of FY 2023, which was
 approximately 26,000 employees.

    Chairman Tester. Senator King.

                    HON. ANGUS S. KING, JR.,
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE

    Senator King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to 
thank both of these gentlemen for coming to Maine in the month 
of July. That is a good time to come to Maine. And 
particularly, when I interviewed Mr. Jacobs at the initiation 
of his nomination I realized very quickly that we were really 
talking about customer service, about how to respond and how to 
respond efficiently and effectively. So I suggested to him that 
he come to Maine and talk to one of our companies that has an 
amazing record of customer service, L.L. Bean.
    So about 2 weeks ago, Mr. Jacobs and two members of his 
team came up, had a fascinating meeting, and I sat in on it, 
with the L.L. Bean customer service team. I would just like to 
get your reflections on that meeting, what you took away from 
that.
    Mr. Jacobs. First of all, Senator, thanks for suggesting 
the idea and helping us connect it, to have that meeting and 
joining us.
    I was blown away by the approach that they have had. This 
is a culture that they have focused a significant amount of 
attention on. In addition to their operational concerns, their 
growth, their profit, they focus extensively on building and 
maintaining the culture that defines the brand.
    And one of the things that really stuck with me, and it is 
something that I think about a lot, is something they call the 
``net promoter score,'' which is how are your customers going 
to come back, how are they going to kind of bring in others, 
talk about it. And I think about it in the context of VBA 
because we know we are the front door for other benefits and 
health care, and we want to encourage veterans to come in and 
access those other earned benefits.
    And what I found striking is that the highest channel for 
net promoter growth was customers who engage through call 
centers and what they do to promote that culture as well as the 
differences between the in-person experience and the online 
experience.
    But I think a lot of it just comes down to culture, which 
is something we are focusing on, and a really strong work 
ethic.
    Senator King. Well, I want to thank you for making the 
visit. It says a lot that you were willing to come and listen 
and learn and bring your team with you.
    Mr. Jacobs. The only thing I regret is I was not able to 
stop at the L.L. Bean store because I had a 5-hour drive to 
Caribou after that, that evening.
    Senator King. And you get credit for that too, as well.
    Our VHA and VBA people have done an amazing job. We are 
screening at 10 percent above the national average, and they 
have really done a great job on the outreach.
    We have got the backlog, and we know it is going to grow 
probably to close to 400,000 or 500,000. Talk to me about how 
we use automation without losing the personal touch and the 
customer relationship that we are talking about.
    Mr. Jacobs. Yes. So, when we talk about automation we are 
not talking full end-to-end automation. What we are talking 
about is automated decision support. So, we are automating the 
administrative tasks to make it easier, less time consuming for 
our employees to search through records, to----
    Senator King. And that was one of the things L.L. Bean 
shared, as I recall.
    Mr. Jacobs. Yes.
    Senator King. Their people that answer the phone have an 
amazing access to data, that they can answer a question 
immediately instead of a long delay or a callback.
    Mr. Jacobs. Correct. And so we are looking to provide those 
tools, including at the Togus Regional Office, where they are 
one of our pilot sites. They are benefiting from the hard work 
of folks in the Montgomery RO, which were one of the earlier 
prototype sites, kind of at the bleeding edge.
    Senator King. And we are talking about a 40-day reduction 
in decision time.
    Mr. Jacobs. Yes.
    Senator King. Significant decision.
    Mr. Jacobs. We are significantly reducing the amount of 
time it takes to process claims, to get to the first decision. 
We are enabling our employees to have more capacity to deliver 
more timely, more accurate, and more consistent decisions, and 
it is tools like this that have the potential to enable us to 
move away from things like mandatory overtime, which we have 
had to rely on to ensure that we are delivering the benefits 
that veterans deserve, at the pace at which they are filing.
    Senator King. Well, I am encouraged with the data that you 
both shared about staffing because as I think it was Senator 
Moran said, you can have all the good intentions, but if you do 
not have the people to execute. And so you are being very 
aggressive, and it looks like staffing is not going to be a 
bottleneck.
    Mr. Jacobs. No. We have been incredibly successful, thanks 
to our HR team and Central office, but also the help of all of 
our regional offices. We have learned along the way, as we have 
done an extensive amount of hiring fairs, we have learned how 
to streamline and increase the percentage of hires.
    Senator King. Are you streamlining--one of the things we 
have discussed in this Committee is the long period between a 
hiring decision and onboarding. How are we doing on that front?
    Mr. Jacobs. Yes. OPM has a standard goal of doing that 
within 80 days. At the end of June, we made about 10,000 
employment selections with 85 percent hired within 80 days.
    Senator King. How about you?
    Dr. Elnahal. I think, Senator, that the issue that we have 
in VHA with hiring is primarily what you just said. Right now 
our median is about 165 days to bring folks on.
    Senator King. Yes, and you are going to lose good people in 
that time.
    Dr. Elnahal. You can lose significant numbers of good 
people, especially talented health care professionals. We want 
the most talented folks in America to be serving veterans.
    Senator King. What is the bottleneck? What takes so long? 
Is it security clearances or other factors?
    Dr. Elnahal. Part of it is some government-specific rules 
that OPM asked us to do, especially for Title 5 employees. But 
a lot of it is just our process, which needs to be made more 
lean and more efficient, to be honest with you.
    So we are very focused on that. We just released our 
standard, much more streamlined hiring process a few weeks ago. 
We are undergoing extensive training of every HR department in 
our networks, our 18 VISNs, and we hope and anticipate in the 
next couple of months that time will go down. It is a little 
bit down from earlier this calendar year, but we need to get 
much closer to what VBA is performing on onboarding time.
    Senator King. Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, 
Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Tester. I was just wondering, Senator King, if you 
could help me get a men's trail model waterproof three-in-one 
jacket through L.L. Bean.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator King. To quote a great American, I know a guy.
    Chairman Tester. Senator Boozman.

                       HON. JOHN BOOZMAN,
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS

    Senator Boozman. I just want to follow up on Senator King 
about the hiring because it is so important. Most people cannot 
put their lives in limbo to wait that long. During the pandemic 
we gave expedited authority, I believe. Did we see any ill 
effects of that, when you were bringing people on in a matter 
of weeks?
    Dr. Elnahal. So Senator, to my knowledge that authority was 
commensurate with the national public health emergency, and 
yes, during that time we were bringing folks on in just a short 
number of days.
    Senator Boozman. But we have that experiment----
    Dr. Elnahal. We do.
    Senator Boozman [continuing]. That we did, and, you know, 
did it work or did it not work?
    Dr. Elnahal. It definitely worked on bringing folks on. At 
the back end, we had to do all of the credentialing and 
privileging and quality checks to determine suitability, and 
our overseers have called out some issues with our suitability 
determinations in the past. And so it always a tough balance, 
Senator, between getting the number of folks on board as fast 
as you can with getting the right quality of individuals, for 
example, who do not have things like State licensing board 
citations and tort claims, things that would surface during the 
normal process.
    So we are happy to talk to you and your staff about ways 
that we might think authorities might help with the onboarding 
times. What I can tell you is the PACT Act authorities have 
helped tremendously. The fact that we can offer, for example, 
lump sum recruitment incentives up front I think have 
encouraged more people to wait it out to be able to get that 
incentive, which has helped. But we should really shorten that 
process, and I am dead focused on that.
    Senator Boozman. Well, let us help with that. I think all 
of us are interested in trying to--you know, that certainly 
does not happen in the private sector, but there are reasons 
for that. But again, we need to fix that. You are simply not 
going to get the quality of people that you need when they have 
to sit around for 18 months wondering if they are going to get 
the job or not.
    So most of my questions have been answered, and you have 
done a good job of answering. I want to reiterate how important 
it is, looking at the backlog. You know, we wanted to tier the 
presumptives. You all felt like you could go forward without 
that, so we are going to be watching that. I know you all are 
watching that. Let us know how we can help.
    But we have worked so hard to get things under control, and 
we certainly do not want that to spiral out of control. So, 
like I say, you all assured us that you could do that, and it 
looks like that you are on the way to doing that.
    The other thing about getting the word out regarding the 
deadline and all of those kinds of things, one of the concerns 
that we have coming from Arkansas, coming from really all the 
States represented here, we have very rural areas. Are we doing 
anything different about the rural areas or are we feeling like 
we are doing enough adequately to take care of those, where 
sometimes information is just a little bit more difficult. Yes, 
that is where so many of our veterans come from.
    Mr. Jacobs. Yes. We are actively pursuing various means of 
outreach to get the word out. In addition to all of the usual 
modalities, whether it is TV or radio or social media, we are 
working with our partners in various communities. Senator King 
mentioned I was in Maine. I went up to Caribou, and I was out 
there in a community event. One of the things we learned is do 
not necessarily host the outreach events in VA facilities. Go 
to the community where the veterans are.
    And we have tools and data to identify where there are 
underserved veterans and underserved parts of our communities. 
So working with our local leaders, working with the States and 
with the counties, we are able to identify and get the word 
out.
    But I think the important takeaway for us is we are pushing 
toward this deadline for us--it is August 9th--to file a PACT 
claim to preserve the earliest possible effective date. Dr. 
Elnahal is pushing for the open enrollment. We cannot stop at 
these deadlines. We have got to continue this approach of 
proactive outreach and trying to reach veterans where they are.
    Senator Boozman. Good. Very good. I am just thinking out 
loud, and you all can chime in, but as somebody that has run a 
lot of campaigns through the years, you know, trying to reach 
people for different reasons, rural radio is something that in 
those areas is very effective. If you are not doing that, 
again, that is a group, too, that I think would be very willing 
to do the public service announcements to get the word out. 
They realize how important it is. But that is another tool. If 
you are not doing it, that is something that you might ought to 
look at focusing on.
    Mr. Jacobs. Yes, Senator. I did a satellite media tour 
with, I think, 25 or 30 local television and radio stations to 
get the word out about PACT, and I think we got about 8 million 
impressions. My hope is that they keep replaying it and that 
increases. But efforts like that, and I know Dr. Elnahal is 
doing the same, trying to reach veterans where they are, is 
important.
    I will add in Winston-Salem, I just got briefed by our 
regional office director who has got a very data-driven, 
forward-leaning outreach effort, working to identify where we 
need to go and holding those leaders accountable to doing that 
outreach. So there is a good model. We have a number of good 
models across the country in making sure that we are 
identifying those best practices and exporting them elsewhere.
    Senator Boozman. Thank you, guys. We do appreciate your 
hard work.
    Chairman Tester. Senator Hassan.

                   HON. MARGARET WOOD HASSAN,
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE

    Senator Hassan. Thank you, Chairman Tester, and to the 
Ranking Member as well. I was really proud to work with 
everyone here on a bipartisan basis to develop and pass the 
PACT Act into law. And it has already helped over 1,000 New 
Hampshire veterans enroll in VA health care and file more than 
2,000 disability claims. So I am excited by that progress, but 
obviously we have more progress to make.
    Dr. Elnahal, I want to start with a question to you. The 
VA's Burn Pits Registry is one way for veterans to document 
their exposure to toxic substances and can help veterans access 
their VA disability benefits. But this online questionnaire is 
lengthy and can be hard for veterans to navigate on their own.
    Just one example. My staff recently met with Ed McCabe from 
Dover, New Hampshire. Ed is a 100 percent disabled combat 
veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was exposed to 
burn pits at an air base in Iraq. Ed told us that he has had a 
hard time joining the Burn Pits Registry because he ran into 
technical problems on the VA's website.
    I understand that the VA is actively working to overhaul 
the Burn Pits Registry, but how are you going to ensure that 
the updates will be more user friendly for veterans like Ed?
    Dr. Elnahal. Thank you, Senator. I think it is a very apt 
question, Senator, and the first thing I will say is I had a 
great visit to Manchester recently. I had a chance to meet the 
excellent team there, who are really taking the PACT Act 
seriously, doing a lot of outreach events.
    We are very focused on making the registry much more user 
friendly. In fact, we think that the work we are doing now will 
largely eliminate the need to do the over 100 questions on the 
website. We already have so many sources of information that 
can automatically populate the information needed in that 
registry. We intend to take every advantage of that. We will be 
sharing more with this Committee and with you and your staff 
once it is available.
    Senator Hassan. Well, it really does make a huge 
difference, as you know, in terms of uptake, in terms of 
efficiency, and in terms of veterans actually getting 
registered, so I look forward to hearing more about that and 
working with you on it.
    Mr. Jacobs, I know that earlier you talked about the 
importance to you and to the VA of the veteran's experience as 
they are interacting with the VA and getting critical services. 
Many Granite State veterans have contacted my office because 
they have concerns about how far they have had to travel to get 
a medical exam for their VA disability claim.
    Recently, the VA Office of the Inspector General found that 
the VA was not adequately monitoring how far veterans were 
actually driving for their exams. So I appreciate the work that 
the VA has done to improve its oversight following that report, 
but I am still concerned that veterans do not know what options 
they have when these appointments get scheduled. So do I want 
one quicker, but I am going to have to drive further? Do I want 
to stay closer to home and wait a little bit longer?
    So you have talked about how important the veteran's 
experience in interacting with the VA is. What are you doing to 
ensure that all veterans know the availability and timing of 
appointments that are close to home?
    Mr. Jacobs. Well, Senator, thanks for raising that 
question. It is a concern that I share as well. We know that 
when a veteran goes to his or her C&P exam it is often a pain 
point. There is this question of what is actually happening. Am 
I getting clinical care or am I getting examined for a 
disability? Sometimes, to your point, it is too far away. 
Sometimes these are in locations that are not sufficiently 
marked.
    So we are working with our vendors to make sure that there 
is clarity in terms of the process. There are steps that 
veterans can take when they receive their examination notice 
and they feel that the timing and/or location is not 
appropriate, but we have got to do a better job of this. And 
that is exactly why we are working with the Veteran Experience 
Office.
    Senator Hassan. Well, that is great because this is really 
an important--I am using the term ``customer service'' but I do 
not think it really conveys how important it is, especially if 
you are somebody with a medical issue or disability, long 
travel can be really difficult.
    Mr. Jacobs. I will add the other thing that we are trying 
to do is we are trying to prevent unnecessary exams and 
overdevelopment. If we do not need a veteran to travel to an 
exam, we should not do that because that is time the veteran 
has to take off of work, they lose paid time off, maybe they 
lose pay itself. We just do not want to do that unless it is 
necessary and beneficial for the veteran.
    Senator Hassan. Okay. I look forward to hearing more about 
it and staying in touch about it.
    Last question, back to you, Dr. Elnahal. The bipartisan 
PACT Act directed the VA to consider new research exploring how 
servicemembers' health has been impacted by exposure to toxic 
substances. In your written testimony you stated that the 
Veterans Health Administration is currently studying the 
impacts of PFAS exposure on veterans. These studies are really 
critical to New Hampshire veterans who were exposed to PFAS 
while serving at the former Pease Air Force Base.
    So can you tell me more about these studies and how the VA 
is collaborating with DoD and the National Guard Bureau in 
gathering the data?
    Dr. Elnahal. Absolutely, Senator, on multiple fronts. So we 
do have an interagency working group that just met this month 
that is investigating this question alongside many other 
exposures and potential conditions associated with them. On top 
of that, we, in particular, collaborate with the components of 
Health and Human Services who are looking into PFAS, which is a 
concerning substance. But we do not know, for example, what 
safe levels or quote/unquote ``normal levels'' are and what the 
association is with specific diseases yet.
    And so that is science that needs to mature, but we, of 
course, are working with them and contributing to that so that 
we can then bring that knowledge to veteran care and better 
develop the research.
    Senator Hassan. Thank you, and thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chairman Tester. Senator Tillis.

                       HON. THOM TILLIS,
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA

    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, both of 
you, for being here.
    I worked a lot on the PACT Act. The TEAM Act was in there, 
Camp Lejeune toxics, and then I voted against it, one of 
probably only 8 or 10. And the reason I voted against it 
clearly was not a policy problem. We were very much invested in 
it. But it was really related to what I thought was additional 
work we should have done to get ahead of some of the 
operational challenges that I want to talk about today. So this 
is a well-intentioned discussion on how do we make it work, and 
I hope you will take my questions in that spirit.
    Mr. Jacobs, the decision was made before you were 
confirmed, actually before you were confirmed. The PACT Act 
contained a phasing-in of benefits eligibility. We included 
this language after a lot of negotiation. A lot of that had to 
do with just moving it in and making sure the implementation 
would be smooth. But I believe that that was really dropped 
almost immediately, and now we are seeing substantial volume.
    So I guess the question I have, with the claims submissions 
outpacing completions, are you confident the VBA can actually 
hire up to the level to address what we are seeing now are bad 
trends?
    Mr. Jacobs. Senator, I am familiar with that decision, and 
I think intuitively it would make sense that you have a phased-
in approach because you want to be able to segment the workload 
and manage it appropriately.
    But what we found through a significant amount of analysis 
was it would have actually increased our workload because what 
would happen is we would receive claims in, for example, 
hypertension from Vietnam veterans, which was scheduled, I 
think, to be effective in fiscal year 2027. We would have to 
consider them through a direct service connection. We would not 
be able to grant them, so then we would just have to hold onto 
them. That is a bad veteran experience, and it would increase 
the total workload because it would require us to touch those 
types of claims twice. As it happens, hypertension is the most 
frequent condition we have received so far for PACT conditions.
    So somewhat counterintuitively, the decision to kind of 
make the effective date immediate upon enactment has enabled us 
to process more claims more effectively.
    Senator Tillis. Well, that is good feedback. We will make 
sure our office catches up with the decision process, but that 
sounds rational. Having said that, we still have a problem.
    Mr. Jacobs. Yes.
    Senator Tillis. And so I think in your testimony you said 
currently VBA is 51 percent below tracked backlog projections 
and peak backlog is supposed to be estimated between 450,000 
and 730,000 by October 2023 and April 2024, respectively.
    Mr. Jacobs. Yes.
    Senator Tillis. Is that accurate?
    Mr. Jacobs. Yes. So we are anticipating an increase in the 
total inventory and the total backlog over the next year before 
we are able to crest. And the reason I have confidence in our 
ability to tackle this workload is because of the significant 
amount of people, process, and technology solutions that we 
have been implementing and will continue to implement.
    And I think it is important to note, we have, over the last 
year, been conducting the most aggressive, forward-leaning 
outreach effort to try to connect veterans with these earned 
benefits, and it is working. We have received almost 35 percent 
more claims today than we had at the same point last year.
    We have also produced more claims than we have ever done in 
our history as an organization. So today we have completed 
about 16 percent more claims than we did at the same point last 
year, which was the highest year ever, 1.7 million claims.
    And the way that we have been able to kind of keep track 
with this work is through the aggressive hiring. This is a 
people-driven business. We are trying to drive more 
efficiencies through automation and the leveraging of those 
technologies and the process improvements to drive out 
inefficiencies. But it is largely people-driven. We have 
increased by 22 percent over the last 18 months. That is what 
has enabled us to be well above our projections. But we know 
that the workload is increasing, and we are doing everything in 
our power to deliver those benefits in a timely way.
    Senator Tillis. Yes, I am glad you are optimistic and you 
look at your hiring practices. But I cannot go to a health care 
provider and not talk about labor and shortfalls on recruiting. 
They are the very same basic people that you are going after. 
In the private sector that is going to mean more expediting 
hiring, signing bonuses, compensation. So we will leave it for 
the record to just talk about how you are mitigating against 
that, and I will have a few questions for the record.
    I did just want to ask one final question that had to do on 
the--I did not lead with this because it was not the economics 
that concerned me about the PACT Act. It was some of the 
implementation issues. But in the interest of time I am not 
going to read through the setup here, but can somebody fill in 
that blank?

    [The information referred to by Senator Tillis appears on 
page 63 of the Appendix.]

    Mr. Jacobs. The total funding request?
    Senator Tillis. Yes.
    Mr. Jacobs. Yes, I would not be able to, Senator.
    Dr. Elnahal. We would be happy to get that back to you for 
the record.
    Senator Tillis. Yes, we will take it for the record because 
the other piece was how much was it really going to cost and 
how are we going to be able to sustain this. And at some point 
you only have so much money, and it is going to create 
stressors. So we are just trying to get an idea of what the 
most up-to-date number is.
    Dr. Elnahal. Yes, and I appreciate you have a 
constitutional responsibility to provide this oversight and ask 
these questions. I feel a great sense of responsibility as well 
to deliver on the promises that this country has made to the 
men and women who have served this country, as I know you do, 
and so happy to provide that information and continue the 
conversation.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you all. We will be in touch with 
your office. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Senator Tillis. And I also want 
to echo that, and that is the funding is expensive. We knew 
this was going to be expensive. When we sent the kids off to 
war in the Middle East nobody talked about this kind of stuff, 
but this is one of the costs of war. So I appreciate that line 
of questioning, Senator Tillis.

VA Response:
 
The Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund (TEF) established by section 805 of
 the PACT Act authorized Congress to fund increased costs above the FY
 2021 level for health care and benefits delivery for Veterans exposed
 to any number of environmental hazards, such as burn pits in Iraq and
 Afghanistan or Agent Orange in Vietnam.
 
The FY 2024 Budget request of $20.3 billion for the TEF is consistent
 with Congress's authorization; it is limited to this increase only and
 excludes costs not associated with exposure to environmental hazards.
 The FY 2024 Budget requests that Congress provide all other funding
 needs in the traditional discretionary appropriations accounts to
 ensure that Veterans have the care and benefits they earned. The
 discretionary appropriations request has been adjusted accordingly to
 account for expenses requested in the TEF that would have been provided
 in other accounts in the past. The FY 2024 Budget includes an estimate
 of $33 billion in net budget authority in FY 2030 for the Toxic
 Exposures Fund.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I just have a question. How many folks in the audience are 
interns? Raise your hand.
    [Show of hands.]
    Chairman Tester. My God. You were just in the longest job 
interview you are ever going to have in your life.
    [Laughter.]
    Chairman Tester. I want to thank you all for being here. I 
know we lost a couple, but I want to thank you guys for being 
here and showing interest. Hopefully you learned something in 
this Committee hearing, so thank you for being here.
    A big thanks to Dr. Elnahal and Mr. Jacobs for being with 
us.
    I think this PACT Act is making a real difference in 
veterans. I hear from them all the time. Folks like Travis from 
Missoula, Montana, who deployed to Somalia, was diagnosed with 
lymphoma. Because of the PACT Act he is receiving benefits, and 
his family are receiving benefits that he earned because of his 
service to this country.
    And together--and I do mean that, together--Congress passed 
a bill, but man, it does not do any good unless we have got 
partners that will implement it. And I want to express my 
appreciation on the work that you guys are doing. And I know it 
is not easy, and I know we are sitting here looking over your 
shoulder. That does not make it easier. But you guys have 
stepped up in a big, big way, and done a good job. That does 
not mean we are not going to be critical of you if you screw 
up, okay? But thank you very much for what you are doing.
    This record will be kept open for one week, and we are 
adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 4:04 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
