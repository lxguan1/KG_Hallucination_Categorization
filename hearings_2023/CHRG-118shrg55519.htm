THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR 
                          FOR FISCAL YEAR 2024

                              ----------                              


                          TUESDAY, MAY 2, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
                 Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:30 a.m. in Room 
SD-366, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Joe Manchin III, 
Chairman of the Committee presiding.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

    The Chairman. This morning, the Committee will be 
discussing the President's proposed Fiscal Year 2024 budget for 
the Department of the Interior and other items within its 
purview. I would like to welcome Secretary Haaland and Deputy 
Secretary Beaudreau back to the Committee as well as Interior 
Budget Director Denise Flanagan. I want to thank you all for 
joining us this morning.
    To set the scene, I think it is important to note for 
context that the Congress provided the Department an additional 
$48.1 billion in the last 19 months, including $47.3 billion in 
targeted investments through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
and Inflation Reduction Act, and a $779 million increase in 
annual appropriations last year. But now, the Administration is 
requesting another $18.9 billion for FY24 for the Department--a 
$2 billion, or 12 percent increase over 2023 Fiscal Year 
appropriations. So I really look forward to hearing the 
justification for such large increases on top of historic 
funding. I also look forward to a robust discussion on the 
state of our leasing programs. I firmly believe that we and our 
allies are going to need fossil fuels for the foreseeable 
future and that robust and continued leasing by the Department 
are a key part of that effort to maintain U.S. leadership in 
energy security.
    Unfortunately, the Administration's actions and the 
President's own statements indicate a desire to tamp down on 
oil and gas leasing. In fact, just last week, the White House 
Press Secretary clearly said the Administration does not like 
the provisions in the IRA that, I quote, ``don't have anything 
to do with clean energy.'' I will repeat that again. He doesn't 
like anything in the IRA that he says doesn't have anything to 
do with clean energy. They all knew perfectly well that it was 
a balanced energy security bill. I assume she is referring to 
the mandated offshore oil and gas leases that I included as 
well as the requirement that oil and gas leasing take place 
before renewable leasing can. If that is the case, let me first 
state for the record that American oil and gas is certainly 
clean energy compared to what the Administration is considering 
importing from Venezuela, and morally cleaner than lifting 
sanctions on Iran. But I also have to assume she is referring 
to these fossil provisions, because internal Interior documents 
from the Alaska lease sale made clear that the Administration 
has manipulated the law to discourage oil and gas interests. In 
fact, they said in black and white that they chose a higher 
royalty rate to discourage energy production at the expense of 
Alaskan energy security.
    That's simply unconscionable to me, especially as the 
Administration is hypocritically happy to target producers for 
not producing more while pursuing a regulatory environment and 
efforts designed to kill the industry by a thousand cuts. The 
truth is that we can produce cleaner energy than anywhere in 
the world, and that production can help bring down our own 
energy costs and support our friends and allies at the same 
time. And this also provides needed revenue for both federal 
and state governments. In fact, the most recent sale mandated 
by the IRA set records for high bids and brought in $263 
million. Let's be clear--we would not be setting bidding 
records if there was no need for oil and gas well into the 
future. I have been very vocal about how concerned I am that we 
are still waiting for the next five-year offshore program of 
oil and gas lease sales. And the Department has said that a 
final program is not expected now until December. We have never 
even had a gap between programs before. Never a gap, let alone 
the year-and-a-half delay that we are expecting now. In fact, 
we talked about this exact issue at this same hearing last 
year. The lack of progress with this program, combined with a 
lack of advanced preparation for 2024 sales, unfortunately 
sends a signal that you have no intention of holding any 
offshore lease sales in 2024 after the final mandatory sale in 
September 2023.
    I know this Administration has a big goal set for offshore 
wind and onshore renewables--goals that are reliant on 
continued oil and gas leasing. I don't know why we can't just 
work together. I don't know why we can't agree that we need a 
balanced approach. So let me remind you that those goals are 
unattainable if you don't do your jobs. I will be watching 
extremely closely to ensure you faithfully execute the law, as 
required not only by the IRA, but also by the Mineral Leasing 
Act, to ensure that onshore and offshore oil and gas leasing 
continues and federal renewable development only occurs if 
those requirements are met.
    Getting back to the budget--while we are being asked to 
fund new initiatives, we are still waiting on Interior to 
comply with requirements in existing law. With agency 
leadership lamenting the lack of staff, and agencies missing 
statutory deadlines, you would think that the Department would 
be putting its resources toward meeting existing statutory 
requirements and deadlines. For example, two different 
requirements for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are now six 
months overdue--one to improve permitting of critical minerals 
and the other to implement carbon sequestration on the Outer 
Continental Shelf. Instead, the Department is prioritizing new 
Administration-developed initiatives.
    In my view, Interior's failures to comply with laws 
Congress has passed is not a question of funding, it is a 
question of misplaced priorities or perhaps a willingness to 
ignore certain requirements. Madam Secretary, I raised this 
issue with you at last year's budget hearing. Then, in 
December, we talked about it with Mr. Beaudreau in our 
Committee's infrastructure implementation hearing after 
additional deadlines had been missed. So I am disappointed that 
here we are again today and having the same conversation again, 
and I am eager to hear from you about how you justify this 12 
percent increase when the Department has not completed the 
tasks at hand, but for which funding was provided. I also look 
forward to talking about the Department's role in permitting, 
and changes needed to the permitting process. I think we can 
all agree that the five years or more it often takes major 
energy or mining projects to get a permit in this country is 
not acceptable.
    Although let me note that I was very happy to see approval 
for the Willow project after long last. This pace is clearly 
too slow to achieve any of our goals, whether it be energy and 
supply chain security, reducing emissions, or reinvesting in 
communities impacted by the energy transition. I look forward 
to hearing about how the DOI is deploying its existing 
resources and current tools to help tackle this issue while 
acknowledging that significant permitting reforms will have to 
come from Congress.
    Secretary Haaland, when it comes to these energy and 
mineral programs that are so crucial to our energy and national 
security, I must say, for the last few years, it has felt like 
we are repeating the same conversations and having these same 
talks over and over. I am tired, and I know the members of this 
Committee are tired, of asking again and again when we will see 
progress on the action required by law and being told ``soon'' 
and ``we are working on it.'' We need and deserve better 
answers than that, especially given the importance of so much 
of what the Department of the Interior is responsible to do. So 
I am hoping that we can have a productive discussion today and 
actually get some detailed answers.
    And now, I am going to recognize Senator Barrasso for his 
opening statement.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING

    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks so much, Mr. Chairman.
    Secretary, welcome back to the Committee.
    In Wyoming, about half of our land is owned by the Federal 
Government. About two-thirds of the minerals under the land are 
owned by the Federal Government. The Secretary of Interior 
controls access to these lands and to the minerals. And as a 
result, the Secretary's decisions deeply affect the people of 
Wyoming. I am sad to say that Secretary Haaland has failed the 
people of Wyoming. Her assault on American energy has 
contributed to soaring energy prices across the country. Her 
efforts to block access to large swaths of the West have led to 
lost economic opportunities, and her decisions often ignore the 
law of the land.
    The Secretary should be following the law. Instead of 
holding quarterly oil and gas lease sales, the Secretary has 
held only one lease sale in two years. Instead of approving oil 
and gas permits on a timely basis, the Secretary has doubled 
the length of the permitting process. Instead of setting 
royalty rates at a level to boost oil and gas production, the 
Secretary has raised rates to discourage production. Instead of 
doing everything in her power to increase America's energy 
security, the Secretary is jeopardizing our energy security, 
and at the same time, our national security. The sad fact is 
that the Secretary's policies undermine even President Biden's 
energy goals. World demand for copper is expected to increase 
by 300 percent by the year 2040. Nickel demand is expected to 
increase by 1,900 percent. Cobalt demand is expected to 
increase by 2,100 percent. But much of this demand will be 
driven by President Biden's mandates and subsidies for electric 
vehicles, for wind farms, for solar panels. Yet earlier this 
year, the Secretary withdrew over 225,000 acres of federal land 
from copper, nickel, and cobalt development in Minnesota. This 
site contains 95 percent of our nation's nickel reserves, 88 
percent of our cobalt reserves, and 34 percent of our nation's 
copper reserves. Minerals from these projects could help 
produce seven million electric vehicles. Yet the Secretary of 
Interior is blocking projects that would produce the very 
materials that are needed to support the Administration's 
stated agenda.
    Let's be clear: President Biden's agenda is not a 
transition from dirty energy to clean energy. It is a 
transition from American energy to foreign minerals. And 
Secretary Haaland's policies will only expand our dependence on 
our adversaries--will increase our dependence on China and on 
Russia. The Secretary is also attacking multiple use of the 
land. Multiple use is a decades-old, bedrock principle of 
federal land management. In March, the Department of the 
Interior released a proposed rule to allow entities to lease 
federal lands for the purpose--not of use--but of non-use. In 
other words, the Secretary wants to make ``non-use'' a use. She 
is calling up ``down,'' day ``night,'' and black ``white,'' 
turning federal law on its head. The Secretary is giving 
radicals a new tool to shut out the public. Remember, 
environmental radicals don't want the public to have access to 
public lands. Families and communities in Wyoming and 
throughout the West depend on access to public lands for 
grazing, for forest management, for recreation. The Secretary 
of Interior is aggressively working to take that access away 
from the public.
    Finally, the Secretary is seeking to cut funding--in a 
budget that has a lot more money for a lot of things--wants to 
cut funding to the Bureau of Reclamation for the third year in 
a row. The Bureau is responsible for delivering water to the 
people of the West. In Wyoming, water sustains everything that 
we do. Our ranchers and farmers produce food for all Americans. 
They need to know that they are going to have enough water to 
do their jobs. So in the midst of a historic drought, now is 
not the time to cut the budget for the Bureau of Reclamation. 
The people of Wyoming and all Americans deserve better.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Now we are going to turn to Secretary Haaland for her 
opening statement.

 STATEMENT OF HON. DEB HAALAND, SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF 
 THE INTERIOR; ACCOMPANIED BY DEPUTY SECRETARY TOMMY BEAUDREAU 
            AND DOI BUDGET DIRECTOR DENISE FLANAGAN

    Secretary Haaland. Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member 
Barrasso, and members of the Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify in support of Interior's FY24 budget 
request. I am pleased to return to this Committee today, 
accompanied by our Deputy Secretary, Tommy Beaudreau and the 
Director of the Department's Budget Office, Denise Flanagan. 
Our 2024 budget totals $18.9 billion in current authority, an 
increase of $2 billion from the 2023 level. First, I want to 
highlight several important proposals. These include 
significant reforms to support the wildland fire workforce, 
mandatory funding for future Indian water rights settlements, 
expanding Good Neighbor and Stewardship Contracting authorities 
to include the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park 
Service, and $6.5 billion over 20 years from the Department of 
State to fund economic assistance under the Compacts of Free 
Association.
    Let me begin with wildland fire. The 2024 budget honors 
President Biden's commitment to address this issue and to 
assist firefighters, supporting an additional 370 federal and 
55 tribal fire personnel. Complementing the pay reforms, we 
also include a $46.4 million increase for fuels management 
activities above 2023. These investments are crucial, as 
wildfires were noticeably higher in 2022 than the ten-year 
average. Our budget's investments for Reclamation, in 
combination with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the 
Inflation Reduction Act, will ensure reliable water and power 
to the American West. The Reclamation request is nearly $1.45 
billion, which is anticipated to be augmented by over $2.4 
billion in other funds. Priorities include WaterSMART funding 
and dam safety. These funds will ensure we stay as nimble as 
possible in the face of drought in a changing climate.
    Stewardship of our natural resources is a core mission for 
us. Interior manages about 20 percent of America's lands and is 
responsible for protection and recovery of more than 2,300 
endangered and threatened species. Our request covers $3.2 
billion in annual funding for conservation efforts that support 
key initiatives, such as wildlife corridors and youth corps 
partnerships. The request also includes $140 million for fish 
and wildlife service partnership programs that support 
voluntary conservation on public and private lands.
    At the Department, science is our foundation. The USGS 
works with partners across the country to maintain 20,000 
groundwater monitoring wells, 11,800 stream gages, and 3,800 
earthquake sensors, and directly monitors 70 volcanoes. The 
budget includes $128 million that supports nine regional USGS 
Climate Adaptation Science Centers with university partners. We 
are also looking forward to the Landsat Next mission, which 
will take advantage of new technologies for global imaging 
data.
    When it comes to energy, we are excited to be on our way to 
achieve the Administration's goals to deploy 30 gigawatts of 
offshore wind capacity by 2030. As of last month, BOEM has 
conducted 11 wind energy lease sales for areas in the Atlantic 
and Pacific Oceans. That is more than 2.5 million acres of 
commercial wind energy lease areas. The budget for BOEM's 
Renewable Energy program includes a $12 million increase for 
permitting. Onshore, BLM is also making progress to permit 25 
gigawatts of renewable energy on public lands by 2025. BLM has 
permitted more than 126 renewable energy projects, processed 
many more, and is working to support much-needed transmission 
lines. To meet these needs, we include $72 million for BLM's 
renewable energy program. At the end of 2020, Interior staffing 
was at a ten-year low of around 60,500. When fully enacted, the 
budget would support an increase of 4,000 personnel to over 
68,000. Staffing is not only important for public-facing 
positions, like national parks and refuges, but also for 
handling the full range of permitting matters before the 
Department and meeting our trust and treaty obligations to our 
country's Indian tribes.
    Regarding infrastructure, our request includes more than $3 
billion for operations and maintenance. In addition, there is 
$1.6 billion in mandatory funding available each year through 
2025 through the Legacy Restoration Fund. At the end of 2023, 
our LRF program will have initiated 276 projects, touching all 
50 states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands. Those projects will address $3.4 billion of our 
deferred maintenance backlog, creating an average of 17,000 
jobs each year.
    Let me close with a few words about our Indian Affairs 
budget request. This Administration has made a steadfast 
commitment to strengthen government-to-government relationships 
with Indian tribes. With a total request of $4.7 billion for 
Indian Affairs programs, investments will address missing and 
murdered indigenous peoples, the legacy of federal Indian 
boarding schools, and Native language revitalization. In 
response to concerns by tribal leaders for public safety in 
their communities, the budget includes an increase of nearly 
$86 million above 2023. We also request $1.6 billion for Indian 
education programs. Notably, the 2024 request for BIE 
construction will support seven school projects.
    Overall, the President's budget for Interior invests in 
programs to strengthen our nation for all Americans. We look 
forward to doing this work together. Thank you, and we are 
pleased to answer any questions.
    [The prepared statement of Secretary Haaland follows:]
     GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT
 
    
    
    The Chairman. Thank you, Secretary Haaland.
    I will start the questions, and my first question will be 
to you. I think last year we asked you to commit that the 
overdue five-year leasing program for offshore oil and gas will 
actually contain lease sales. We still don't have the program 
in place and we know that you don't plan to finalize the 
program until December of this year at the earliest, which is 
18 months late. Additionally, the Department has not started 
the environmental review process for the 2024 sales, which 
makes it very unlikely that you are going to do any leasing 
next year in 2024 because the IRA ties wind leasing to oil and 
gas. Failing to take an all-of-the-above approach to energy 
security puts the Administration at risk of taking a none-of-
the-above approach. They will get nothing. That is how 
important this is.
    So maybe you can explain to me the time and why it is 
taking so long and why your intentions are so far behind from 
what we had asked for and what the law has said.
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you, Chairman, for the question.
    And first, I will say that the reason the five-year plan is 
behind is because the previous Administration dropped the ball 
and stopped working on the plan. Our staff picked it up. They 
started working on it. We expect the final plan out in 
September. Of course, we understand fully, we are mindful of 
the provisions of the IRA, and we will follow the law with 
respect to leasing. And I want to say that we are moving this 
forward and we will be happy to keep you apprised of the 
process.
    The Chairman. My only comment on that would be that I think 
the previous Administration still did leasing in a timely 
fashion from what we understand, unless you have a different 
calculation of that or a different review, unless you didn't 
like what was done. I don't know.
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, I was talking with respect to 
the five-year plan. You asked why it was late.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    Permitting in the Department of the Interior is simply 
taking too long, both for energy security goals and our 
environmental goals. According to the Council on Environmental 
Quality, from 2010 to 2018, DOI's environmental impact 
statements averaged five years to get to a record decision--
five years. Furthermore, basic Fish and Wildlife Service 
reviews that used to be completed within weeks are taking 
months, while leaders from the BLM and other agencies are 
blaming permitting delays on a lack of funding for staffing. 
The IRA allocated $150 million to Interior, specifically 
dedicated to permitting, on top of the $500 million in 
conservation and resilience funding split between the National 
Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The Department 
and its agency are also able to access the IRA's $350 million 
of transferrable funding from the Federal Permitting 
Improvement Steering Council. Have you all spent all that 
money? I mean, is it all gone and you are deficient now and 
that is why you are not able to do it on time?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, thank you for the question and 
of course, we understand that permitting does take a long time. 
You can't just open a can and spill out a permit. It takes a 
lot of research and work by the career staff, and they are 
dedicated. You know that we have approved many, many permits 
since the beginning of this Administration, since January 2021. 
With respect to oil--to drilling permits, the applications to 
drill were moved forward. There are nearly 7,000 currently 
unused.
    The Chairman. Do you all support, as an agency, the 
permitting reforms that you are hearing on both sides of the 
aisle, that Democrats and Republicans are both saying that we 
need, and have you all been able to give us some ideas or some 
support on how we can expedite this?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, I recognize that that is a 
continuous issue and I can't speak to whether the 
Administration supports or doesn't support, however, we will 
continue to do our jobs and move all of those permits forward. 
And we have done a tremendous amount of work, as I mentioned. 
There are nearly 7,000 permits currently that are unused. They 
kept processing permits since we came into office.
    The Chairman. Are there any codes that we could clear up or 
try to change to be helpful toward the permitting process and 
expediting it? No matter what side of the fence you may be on, 
an all-in energy policy means we have to do everything. And for 
that, renewables are having the same challenges that fossil 
fuels are, and what we are needing is a way forward if we are 
going to do anything.
    Secretary Haaland. Yes, thank you, Chairman. I appreciate 
your willingness to help us with that issue, and of course, we 
will be happy to stay in touch with your office and work 
together to expedite things.
    The Chairman. Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    Secretary Haaland, the Mineral Leasing Act requires the 
Department to hold quarterly lease sales in each state with 
federal oil and gas resources. That is one lease sale every 
three months in each state with the resources. So in the nine 
quarters since President Biden took office, the Department has 
held a grand total of one lease sale in each of these states--a 
single lease sale in over two years. Now, I am glad to see the 
Department has now announced plans to hold lease sales in the 
second and third quarters of this year. My question is, will 
you commit to resuming oil and gas lease sales each and every 
quarter going forward, as required by law?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you very much for the question, 
Senator, and of course, we follow the law in everything we do. 
We have had lease sales. We will continue to have lease sales. 
I know that President Biden believes in energy independence and 
we are working toward that goal.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, let me just point out--you just 
said we follow the law, but you have not followed the law. 
Under oath during your confirmation hearings, you sat here and 
you said I will absolutely follow the law, but yet, for nine 
quarters since President Biden took office, the Department has 
held only one lease sale. So I don't know how you consider that 
following the law.
    So the question again is, will you commit to resuming oil 
and gas lease sales each and every quarter going forward as 
required by law? Yes or no?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, we will always follow the law--
--
    Senator Barrasso. You haven't been following the law. Yes 
or no--please answer the question, yes or no--will you commit, 
sitting here, to resuming oil and gas lease sales each and 
every quarter going forward, as required by law?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, in 2022, we had lease sales in 
Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, the Dakotas, Nevada, and New 
Mexico----
    Senator Barrasso. One lease sale, when the required law 
required that you had nine quarters' worth of leases. So you 
have not been following the law.
    Yes or no going forward?
    Secretary Haaland. We are planning 12 onshore lease sales 
that are in the planning process for 2023. And we are currently 
planning multiple sales in Wyoming beginning in June. Montana 
and North Dakota, also beginning in June, with additional sales 
in September and December. Utah, Nevada, and New Mexico, 
which----
    Senator Barrasso. We know what all the public land states 
are. That's a good list. The question is, going forward, next 
year, will you commit to following the law each and every 
quarter as required by law?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, we will follow the law.
    Senator Barrasso. You haven't been doing it so far.
    Let me move on, Mr. Chairman.
    Last month, the Bureau of Land Management proposed a 
fundamental change in American land management policy. This 
illegal proposal--and it is illegal and it does not follow the 
law--would make non-use of lands a competing use. Your proposal 
would give radical environmentalists a new tool to block 
activities that are guaranteed in the law, such as grazing, 
recreation, and mineral development. Please explain why you 
think putting large swaths of federal lands off-limits upholds 
the multiple-use mandate in the law?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, thank you very much for the 
question, and the public lands rule is actually a proposed 
draft rule currently in public comment period that would 
essentially put conservation on equal footing with our multi-
use mandate. It would not foreclose other uses of our public 
lands such as grazing or mining or energy development.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, the so-called public lands rule 
that you referred to is nothing more than a thinly veiled 
attempt to eliminate economic activities on federal lands in 
Wyoming and across the West, and I would strongly urge you to 
withdraw this disastrous and illegal proposal.
    Next, earlier this year, you blocked access to federal 
minerals in an area that contains 88 percent of our nation's 
known cobalt reserves. Cobalt is a critical mineral necessary 
for electric vehicle batteries. Do you know where most of the 
world's cobalt is mined today?
    Secretary Haaland. I beg your pardon, sir?
    Senator Barrasso. Do you know where most of the world's 
cobalt is mined today?
    Secretary Haaland. I am sure you will tell me, Senator.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, it is the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo. So in your view, does the Congo or the United States 
have better environmental standards?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, the United States has better 
environmental standards and better worker standards.
    Senator Barrasso. So in your view, does the Congo or the 
U.S. have better protection against child labor?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, with respect to the issue you 
are speaking of, I assume that it is the Boundary Waters 
watershed, and that was put to us as a copper mine, not as a 
cobalt mine.
    Senator Barrasso. So why are you blocking access, though, 
to our nation's cobalt resources? You can't possibly be willing 
to ignore what is taking place in the Congo. It has been all 
over the news for years. Here are a couple of headlines in 
terms of the mine that you blocked. National Public Radio, 
``How `Modern-Day Slavery' in the Congo Powers the Rechargeable 
Battery Economy.'' The Independent, `` `Here it is better not 
to be born': Cobalt mining for Big Tech is driving child labor 
and deaths in the Congo.'' The Guardian, `` `Like slave and 
master': DRC miners toil for 30 pence an hour to fuel electric 
cars.'' The New York Times, Newsweek, go after any of them. 
Again, why are you blocking access to our nation's cobalt 
resources, because that is what you have done?
    [Poster with aforementioned headlines and quotes follows:]
     GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT
 
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, near the Boundary Waters 
watershed, it was put to us as a copper mine. Copper is not a 
critical mineral in this country.
    Senator Barrasso. This is a mineral that is needed to 
fulfill the President's goal on electric vehicles. It's 
straightforward. You can't get critical minerals without 
mining. Mining in America is better for our economy. It's 
better for the environment. It's better for the people of the 
world. You need to stop blocking access to our nation's 
resources.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Heinrich.
    Senator Heinrich. Secretary, you mentioned the progress 
that has been made in offshore wind leasing. When do you expect 
the first utility-scale offshore wind projects to actually be 
permitted?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you for the question, Senator. If 
you could just give me one second.
    Senator Heinrich. Sure.
    Secretary Haaland. Well, I can tell you that the transition 
to clean energy is a priority for this Administration. It is a 
priority for us. We are working on all fronts to move all of 
those forward. If it is anything in particular, of course, we 
are happy to stay in touch with you, but we plan on meeting the 
Administration's goal to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind 
energy by 2030.
    Senator Heinrich. So to meet the 2030 guideline will 
require a number of projects to actually make it through the 
permitting pipeline. Are you on track to do that?
    Secretary Haaland. We believe we are. It is--we believe we 
are.
    Senator Heinrich. Do you have a sense for what year the 
first projects would be permitted?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, if it is okay, our staff will 
get back with you.
    Senator Heinrich. Okay.
    Secretary Haaland. When we have a specific----
    Senator Heinrich. I think there are a lot of steps in 
between leasing and permitting, and I am concerned that the 
progress and the economics have changed in ways that put a lot 
of those projects potentially at risk. So I would love an 
update on the specifics of making it through the permitting 
process with respect to those leases.
    Thanks to the STOP Act, which was signed into law in 
December, it is finally illegal for people to export tribal 
religious items for sale in foreign markets. And as you know 
all too well, these items have been illegal to sell in the U.S. 
for decades, but frankly, until December, sellers could take 
them out of the country and put them in auction houses 
overseas. Tell us about what the Department is doing to 
implement the STOP Act.
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you for the question and thank 
you, Senator, for your hard work on this important issue. So 
right now we are focused on the tribal consultation process and 
the rulemaking mandated by the statute. We have five 
consultation sessions starting in May through August to hear 
from tribes. And as a result, we should have a detailed plan 
regarding office and regulations by the end of the year.
    Senator Heinrich. Thank you.
    As you work to also implement the Great American Outdoors 
Act, I am still concerned about bottlenecks that threaten some 
of the conservation gains that we all expect from permanent 
Land and Water Conservation Fund funding. And specifically, in 
last year's spending bill, Congress directed the Department of 
the Interior to evaluate a wide variety of potential 
improvements to the appraisal process, including returning some 
appraisal functions back to individual bureaus. Can you tell us 
about the progress that you have made so far to improve the 
appraisal process?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, thank you so much, and I 
appreciate the question. Yes, there are difficult roadblocks 
that we are tackling. We stood up the DOI-wide working group 
that reports to the DOI leadership. We are identifying root 
causes and changes with near-term results. We are also building 
capacity. We have done some innovative recruiting and using 
increased pay rate authority to help, you know, get a team 
together. We have increased the number of appraisers. There are 
105 on board. It is the highest since the Appraisal and 
Valuation Services Office was created. And of course, there is 
a focus on customer service to make sure that we are meeting 
people where they are.
    Senator Heinrich. Have you looked at returning some of 
those appraisal functions back to individual bureaus?
    Secretary Haaland. I couldn't answer that at the moment, 
Senator, but we are moving forward and it is under review.
    Senator Heinrich. Have you submitted the report on this 
topic that was due to Congress in March?
    Secretary Haaland. I--I beg your pardon. Sorry, we are 
continually briefing the Committee, thank you. We have a whole 
team here that does these things.
    Senator Heinrich. Sure.
    Secretary Haaland. We are continually briefing the 
Committees and we are happy to stay in touch with you as soon 
as it is done.
    Senator Heinrich. That is different than--we asked for a 
written report on this process. Has that been submitted to the 
Congress?
    Secretary Haaland. I could not give you a date at the 
moment, Senator, but we are happy to follow up with your 
office.
    Senator Heinrich. But you expect to submit that?
    Secretary Haaland. Yes, yes.
    Senator Heinrich. Okay.
    Thank you, Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Now we have Senator Risch.
    Senator Risch. Well, thank you very much.
    Secretary, thank you for coming. As you know, the Federal 
Government owns two out of every three acres in Idaho--67 
percent--so it is always interesting to meet with the person 
who actually has more to say and more control over our lands 
than Idahoans do. So thank you for coming.
    I want to focus on one thing today--one thing and one thing 
only--and that is the Lava Ridge Wind Project in Idaho. Have 
you heard of it?
    Secretary Haaland. Yes.
    Senator Risch. Okay. You have heard of it because 
Congressman Simpson, Congressman Fulcher, twice this year, have 
raised it with you in hearings, is that right?
    Secretary Haaland. Yes, I believe so.
    Senator Risch. And they told me that at that time, you did 
not know anything about it, but that you were going to look 
into it. Is that a fair statement?
    Secretary Haaland. Yes, I suppose.
    Senator Risch. Okay. So what have you found out?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you, Senator. And----
    Senator Risch. You don't need to thank me, just answer the 
question.
    Secretary Haaland. Well, thank you for the question.
    Senator Risch. Well----
    Secretary Haaland. The BLM has been engaged with 
stakeholders, including the state, local counties, grazing 
permittees, and other federal agencies early on in the process. 
It is coordinated with the Idaho Resource Advisory Council and 
the Lava Ridge Wind Project, our RAC subcommittee, and the BLM 
has also coordinated with DOI's Collaborative Action and 
Dispute Resolution staff to engage stakeholders with ties to 
the Minidoka Historical Site.
    Senator Risch. That's great.
    What did you find out with all this coordination and 
discussion and meetings?
    Secretary Haaland. We are going to continue to engage.
    Senator Risch. No, no, what did you find out?
    Secretary Haaland. Well, I think the conversations are 
ongoing, Senator.
    Senator Risch. Well, what did you find out so far? Nothing?
    Secretary Haaland. The conversations are ongoing. We are--
--
    Senator Risch. What did you find out so far?
    Secretary Haaland. I don't have a complete readout of all 
the meetings.
    Senator Risch. Give me an incomplete readout. What did you 
find out so far?
    Secretary Haaland. Well, I think they are gaining insight 
into how the community feels and what they have to say.
    Senator Risch. And what have you found out so far?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, I am happy to update you as 
time goes on.
    Senator Risch. Yes, all right. Let me help you out here--
try to get you some information on this. Do you know how many 
acres are involved in this?
    Secretary Haaland. I beg your pardon?
    Senator Risch. Do you know how many acres are involved in 
this?
    Secretary Haaland. I don't have the number.
    Senator Risch. It is 146,000 acres. Do you consider that a 
fairly significant piece of real estate?
    Secretary Haaland. I think 146,000 acres is a large 
acreage, yes.
    Senator Risch. It is. They are talking about 378 turbines. 
The smallest ones are just slightly bigger than the Statue of 
Liberty. The largest turbines are--have you ever been to 
Seattle?
    Secretary Haaland. Yes, sir.
    Senator Risch. Have you seen the space tower--or excuse 
me--the space needle?
    Secretary Haaland. I don't think I have seen the space 
needle----
    Senator Risch. Well, the needle, whatever it is called, the 
big, tall building there?
    Secretary Haaland. No, I have not.
    Senator Risch. Okay. Well, the largest turbines will be 100 
feet taller than this structure in Seattle. Now, I know the 
Administration is interested in renewable energy, and I think 
everybody in Congress is also. This will turn out about 1,000 
megawatts of power. Idaho already puts out 75 percent of its 
energy generated using renewable power. It's a combination of a 
number of things--falling water, nuclear, and other things. 
It's stunning to us that you would think of 146,000 acres for 
1,000 megawatts. And let me tell you why. We are, in the next 
24 to 36 months, we are going to be turning on three small 
modular reactors. Thirty-six acres. Thirty-six acres, and it 
will put out about the same as this 146,000 acres. I know you 
love the land. Everybody does. I want you to take a quick look 
at this picture, a rendering of what the landscape out there 
will look like.
    Kayla, could you hand that to her for me, please?
    [The rendering referred to follows:]
     GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT
 
    
    Senator Risch. And I want you to look at this closely. Look 
at the horizon where you can see these structures coming up and 
tell me if that's your vision of what public lands should look 
like. And by the way, that is a view from the Minidoka 
Historical Site. Do you know what the Minidoka Historical Site 
is?
    Secretary Haaland. I have not been there, Senator.
    Senator Risch. Do you know what it is?
    Secretary Haaland. It is a historical site.
    Senator Risch. Well, let me tell you what it's a historical 
site for. It was one of the detention sites during World War II 
for Japanese people, of which we have a significant population 
in Idaho. This land means a lot to them. This is what it looks 
like from there. Tell me. Look at the horizon and tell me, is 
that your vision for what public lands should look like?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, did you say this is a 
rendering?
    Senator Risch. It is.
    Secretary Haaland. So they put--so they superimposed those 
on?
    Senator Risch. Exactly. By looking at that you can stand at 
the historical site and look to the horizon and see what your, 
mine, our public lands, will look like with--on this 146,000 
acres. Is that your vision of what public lands should look 
like?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, I think there are a lot of 
visions for public lands across----
    Senator Risch. Nah, nah, no, no, no. Don't give me that. Is 
that your vision for what public lands should look like in 
America?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, we have millions of acres of 
public lands all over the country and they all look different.
    Senator Risch. Do you like that?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, I understand what you are 
saying and I want you to know that we care deeply about the--we 
listen to people. We get their input.
    Senator Risch. I am glad you are listening to people 
because let me tell you who you should be listening to. First 
of all, you have a Resource Advisory Council, a RAC Committee 
there, do you not?
    Secretary Haaland. Yes.
    Senator Risch. Do you know what they've said about this? 
Your council, do you know what they said, unanimously, about 
this?
    Secretary Haaland. Please tell me, Senator.
    Senator Risch. Don't do it. We have a legislature in Idaho. 
Republicans and Democrats. They passed a resolution in both the 
House and the Senate, unanimously, bipartisan. You know what 
they said?
    Secretary Haaland. Don't do it?
    Senator Risch. You got it. That's exactly what they said. 
There is a resolution by the seven Idaho counties that are 
involved in this. All seven of them passed a unanimous 
resolution. You know what they said? Don't do it.
    There have been letters signed, unanimously, by the Friends 
of Minidoka and the large Japanese American community, inside 
and outside of Idaho, and you know what they said? Don't do it.
    You received a letter from myself, the Governor, the rest 
of our delegation and we have said the same thing--don't do it.
    [Letters, resolutions, and other items related to the Lava 
Ridge Wind Project follow:]

    Senator Risch. So let me close with this--don't do it.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator, appreciate it.
    Senator Hirono.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Secretary Haaland, I first want to thank you for the 
Department's financial support to help save Hawaii's remaining 
native forest birds. I am hopeful that the strong partnership 
with federal, state, and non-profit partners will advance key 
actions to prevent the extinction of these culturally and 
ecologically significant birds. In the last few months, there 
have been many hearings in the state legislature relating to 
the efforts to save our endangered birds, and this engagement 
of our local youth and native Hawaiians in particular has been 
very important. It has been very moving because these are young 
people who are passionate about their desire to save these 
remaining native birds. So as DOI looks to FY 2024, can you 
talk briefly about the Department's plans and resources needed 
to continue supporting these efforts?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you very much, Senator. And of 
course, we recognize the importance of Hawaii's birds to the 
ecology and what they bring to the forests and to the culture 
of the Hawaiian Islands. The bill funding has been critical for 
this effort to prevent the extinction of birds imperiled by 
avian malaria, and so, you know, further support of the work we 
are doing will allow us to move forward with a multi-agency 
strategy to address this disease, and coordination among 
federal agencies and with the Native Hawaiian community, the 
State of Hawaii, and other partners is critical to finish this 
job.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you. So what I am hearing is that you 
will pay continued attention and provide support----
    Secretary Haaland. Absolutely.
    Senator Hirono. For saving our endangered birds.
    Secretary Haaland. Yes.
    Senator Hirono. I am working with my colleagues to ensure 
that the Compacts of Free Association for the Marshall Islands, 
the Republic of Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia 
are in place before financial support begins to expire at the 
end of this fiscal year, and I note that your testimony 
mentions the importance of this financial support. I would like 
to point out though, we also need to restore in the Compacts 
the ability of the Compact citizens who are living in our 
country, throughout our states, not just Hawaii, but in 
Arkansas and in other states throughout our country, that we 
need to restore access to federal benefits for these COFA 
citizens, and I would like to have that restoration language 
put in the Compact. So this is not just funding the Compacts to 
the countries themselves, but also to enable the citizens 
living in our country the kind of support that they should be 
entitled to.
    So I would like to work with you on making sure that this 
language is included in the Compacts, which, by the way, is 
critical to our national defense, and DOD is well aware of how 
important the Compacts are to our own national security. This 
is a situation in which there are three agencies that are 
involved--that is Interior, because it is our Committee that 
approves these Compacts; then we have the DOD, which is the 
major beneficiary, not to mention our country--beneficiary of 
the national security provided under these Compacts; and then, 
the State Department. And that is why all three administrative 
agencies need to come together to restore the eligibility for 
the social services programs that are so important.
    So I would like to be able to work with you to talk with 
you about how we can go forward.
    I also wanted to thank you for your commitment to engaging 
with the indigenous communities, including the Native Hawaiian 
communities, and in particular, the recent announcement from 
the Department's Office of Native Hawaiian Relations that 
another $1 million will be available for Native Hawaiian 
organizations to utilize through the Heritage Opportunities in 
Hawaii Grant Program. And this program is designed to enhance 
the tourism industry with the vibrant aspects of the Native 
Hawaiian community in a sustainable and equitable way.
    I know that you know how important tourism is to Hawaii's 
economy, but I also know that so many of the tourists who come 
to Hawaii very much appreciate their ability to experience the 
Native Hawaiian culture, and so, while we need to work to 
enhance our support for tourism, this has to be done through a 
lot of sensitivity to the interests of the Native Hawaiian 
community and also our environment. I would like to ask you to 
continue to make sure that those aspects are very much paid 
attention to as we go forward.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Daines.
    Senator Daines. Chairman, thank you.
    Grizzly bears have now exceeded--exceeded--recovery targets 
in both the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and the Northern 
Continental Divide Ecosystems and bear numbers well over the 
objectives set by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Grizzlies 
are ranging farther off the Rocky Mountain front into Central 
Montana, where they haven't been seen for over a century. It is 
past time to celebrate this recovery, delist the bears, and 
return the management back to the states. Fish and Wildlife 
Service scientists have twice found that the Greater 
Yellowstone Ecosystem bears have recovered and delisted them, 
but courts have prevented delisting from going into effect.
    Secretary Haaland, I am confident that the career 
scientists will find yet for a third time in just the past 17 
years that the Greater Yellowstone bears have recovered. When 
that happens, will you support legislation to codify the Fish 
and Wildlife Service's delisting to prevent legal uncertainty?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you for the question, Senator. And 
as you said, the courts require us to look at the species 
population as a whole, and even though they have recovered in 
some areas, it is not true for every area----
    Senator Daines. So the question, specifically, was the 
Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
    Secretary Haaland. Well, it is good news that yes, the 
grizzly bear is recovering, as I said, in some areas.
    Senator Daines. Wait a minute. I want to say--recovering--
have the grizzly bears exceeded the target in the Greater 
Yellowstone Ecosystem in population?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, yes, as I mentioned, the 
grizzly bears are recovering in some areas. In other areas, 
they are not. It requires us to look at the grizzly bear 
population as a whole.
    Senator Daines. I understand. But you are not answering my 
question. The specific question is the Greater Yellowstone 
Ecosystem, and you said they have recovered. So given that we 
agree that they have recovered, will you support legislation to 
codify Fish and Wildlife Service delisting to prevent this 
legal uncertainty?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, we will follow the science and 
the law. I know Director Williams and her staff take this role 
very seriously. Also, the Endangered Species Act has been a 
lifesaver for many species. We will continue to follow the 
science and the law with respect to grizzly bears.
    Senator Daines. Well, I am glad we agree that the grizzlies 
have recovered in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, and 
additionally, would you commit to keeping the Fish and Wildlife 
Service to that 12-month review timeline?
    Secretary Haaland. I will be happy to update you on any 
reviews that the Fish and Wildlife Service are responsible for. 
They work very hard.
    Senator Daines. The question was, will you commit to the 
12-month timeline--would you commit to working together to get 
that done in 12 months?
    Secretary Haaland. I know they work very hard to meet their 
obligations.
    Senator Daines. That is not an answer. Will you commit to 
the 12-month timeline that has been laid out by statute?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, we work very hard to meet our 
timeline. We will commit to the science and the law.
    Senator Daines. That is not an answer. Secretary Haaland, I 
am saying, will you commit to that, just to work together to 
meet the 12-month statutory timeline?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you. We will do our best, Senator.
    Senator Daines. That is not an answer, but thank you.
    On March 31, the Bureau of Land Management published the 
text for a proposed rule that fundamentally alters the Agency's 
management of public lands under the Federal Land Management 
Policy Act. I have significant concerns with that proposed 
rule. You would hurt Montanans by threatening multiple uses, 
such as ranching, mining, logging, and outdoor recreation that 
are all a part of our Montana way of life. Conservation is 
vital, but this proposal hinders conservation by rushing 
forward with ill-conceived, vague, and rather opaque plans. My 
question is this--grazing on federal lands provides billions of 
dollars each year in ecosystem services, wildlife habitat, 
recreational opportunities, clean air, clean water, things that 
certainly can be quantified. I am concerned that your 
Department feels the need to attempt to separate these multiple 
uses from any ``conservation value.'' In your opinion, does 
grazing provide conservation benefit?
    Secretary Haaland. The proposed public lands rule would not 
foreclose any other uses of public lands, such as grazing.
    Senator Daines. Do you think that grazing has a 
conservation benefit?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, I want you to know that the 
public lands rule that you are so concerned about will not 
foreclose any other uses. All it does is put conservation on an 
equal footing with the multi-use mandate that we have.
    Senator Daines. In closing, Secretary Haaland, I know your 
team, by the way, is working with the Fort Belknap Tribe to 
finalize language in their water rights settlement. This has 
been a battle we have had in Montana for many, many years, and 
I am very glad to see we are making progress moving forward. I 
would urge you to quickly wrap up discussion so that we can 
introduce--I am going to introduce that bill and finally get 
that settlement signed into law. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    I have a request to introduce into the record some 
literature concerning the turbine size comparison.
    Any objections?
    Without objection.
    [The turbine size comparison chart follows:]

    The Chairman. And now, we have Senator Cortez Masto.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Madam Secretary, it is good to see you. Thank you for being 
here. And thank you for working with me and other members of 
the Nevada delegation on the designation of the Avi Kwa Ame 
National Monument in Southern Nevada. It was great to see you 
and your team there. As you know, this is very important to 
local tribes for its cultural significance. Likewise, one of my 
top priorities in Congress, as both a member of this Committee 
and as a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, has 
been to engage with tribal nations to help address their needs, 
but also to advance their priorities around protection of 
places of cultural and historic importance.
    Last week, on April 26th, I sent you a letter along with my 
fellow Nevada Senator, Jacky Rosen, in support of the proposed 
Bahsahwahbee, or Swamp Cedars National Monument.
    [The letter referred to follows:]
     GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT
 
    
    Senator Cortez Masto. For years, this area for our tribes 
has been a site of extreme significance, where nearly 1,000 of 
their ancestors were killed during the 19th century massacres 
that took place during religious gatherings. It is also home to 
the sacred and ecologically unique grove of juniper trees in 
our state. I support creating this monument, but I will note 
there are existing land-use conflicts that will require 
engagement with all of the impacted stakeholders, including 
those with interest in renewable energy development, 
transmission, grazing, water rights, and others. My question to 
you, Madam Secretary, is, will you join me in supporting this 
monument, and will you work with me and my constituents in 
determining how best to preserve and commemorate this sacred 
place?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you very much, Senator, for your 
support of Indian Country in Nevada. And yes, we are going to 
give this our close attention. Thank you for the letter. And we 
will learn more as time goes on, but certainly, as you know 
with Avi Kwa Ame, the best conservation is community-led 
conservation. And so we are going to have all those 
conversations and make sure that we pay close attention.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. I appreciate that. And 
thank you again. Listen, we are not going to always agree on 
everything. Of all of the western states, over 80 percent of 
the land is owned by the Federal Government. We have to work 
together, and I think there is an opportunity for us to work 
together, but I am also going to challenge you when I disagree 
with the BLM.
    Secretary Haaland. Absolutely.
    Senator Cortez Masto. But I think we can be civil and do so 
without being condescending or badgering. I also think that for 
the purposes that you are dealing with right now, it must be 
challenging, all right, I would say you have whiplash, because 
I hear from my Republican colleagues about the importance of 
Biden's clean energy economy when they did not support the 
legislation in the first place. So I appreciate what you are 
trying to do.
    I am going to hold you accountable where I see that you 
should be. One of those areas is where Senator Daines just 
talked about, which is the conservation lease rule on grazing. 
As you know, there is a lot of grazing in Nevada. The proposed 
rule includes three management changes. The ranching/grazing 
community in my state has expressed concern that this could be 
a way to limit grazing. They are also upset they were not 
consulted prior to the proposed rule's release. And so, my 
question to you is, the BLM recently released a proposed rule 
to elevate the conservation to be on the same footing. You have 
talked about this. But how will you be working with the 
ranching community to preserve their ability to continue to use 
the land when you have not sought their input?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, as you know, it is a proposed 
and a draft rule currently. It is under public comment, and so 
we expect all of, you know, everyone to comment, if they would 
like to. It is not a final rule by any means. And as I 
mentioned earlier, it would not foreclose other uses of the 
multi-use mandate for public lands, and grazing is one of 
those.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Well, I am going to be watching and 
holding you accountable to that.
    Secretary Haaland. Absolutely.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Because it is such an important issue 
in my state and across the West, as you have heard, and we have 
to make sure our cattle ranchers and our ranchers and farmers, 
their voices are heard and their businesses are not going to be 
limited in any way, whatsoever.
    Secretary Haaland. Yes. And Senator, if I could say, of 
course, the work that they do is contingent on a healthy 
ecosystem. They need healthy grass to grow if they want to move 
their businesses forward and we recognize that as well.
    Senator Cortez Masto. And thank you, because I know, of the 
ranchers and farmers in my state, they are environmentalists, 
for the very reason that you just said. They know the land 
better than anyone because they live off the land and have for 
generations. So thank you.
    One other area I want to talk about is, in the past, the 
Interior Department has wasted a considerable amount of time 
and resources on oil and gas leases that generate little 
returns for American taxpayers. I know the Department has 
issued guidance on how BLM plans to implement reforms to the 
oil and gas leasing systems from the IRA, some of which are 
expected to cut down on wasteful leasing practices. Yet, as the 
current system still stands, 90 percent of the federal lands 
and minerals that BLM manages across the West are open to oil 
and gas leasing, and yet a vast majority of those lands have 
little to no potential for oil and gas development. This is a 
conversation that I constantly have with BLM. They are wasting 
their time on some of these claims that there is oil and gas 
when we know there is not, when the resources could be put 
somewhere else.
    So as DOI moves forward with the proposed rulemaking, how 
do you plan to address the availability of land with low 
development potential for leasing?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, thank you for the question. And 
of course, this is an important issue. We are implementing the 
provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, like fees on 
expressions of interest. So if you charge people for an 
expression of their interest, they are going to think twice 
about, you know, having it all. So we feel that that will help 
to reduce the speculative leasing that is happening.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Hoeven.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Secretary, I would like to pick up on a question that 
Senator Cortez Masto just asked you. She asked, you know, why 
spend time on land--BLM land--with federal lands that have low 
potential for leasing for energy development. So I am going to 
ask you the other side of that--the converse. Why are you 
blocking development on land that has high potential for energy 
development? Right now, you have issued a draft resource 
management plan that affects my State of North Dakota. It will 
block 45 percent of the potential federal oil and gas acreage 
and 95 percent of the federal coal acreage. So you know, she 
asked the question, well, why would you waste your time on 
lands that are not going to be leased for energy, but why are 
you blocking the development on lands that can produce energy 
at a time when gasoline prices are higher and we need more 
electricity and more baseload dependability for our grid, and 
you are blocking the federal leases that we need to produce 
that energy? Why is that?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, I would say that there is a 
process that we go through when we think about the lease sales 
that we have to have. It is not so much blocking as it is 
assessing what lands are available and which lands should be up 
for lease.
    Senator Hoeven. But you are not putting them up for lease. 
You not only are blocking development, you have raised royalty 
rates, and as a result, energy prices are higher. Why wouldn't 
you allow our energy producers to produce more energy here at 
home to bring prices down at the pump, to reduce prices for 
hardworking consumers across America?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, oil production is at an all-
time high on federal public lands here in our country. There is 
a lot that goes into determining the price of gas. If it were 
just supply, then prices would be low right now because we are 
doing our jobs, and that is the truth. There is more oil that 
is being produced currently than there ever has been in our 
country.
    Senator Hoeven. No, no, no.
    What you like to refer to is because New Mexico had a lot 
of leases that were leased out prior to your Administration and 
they are now being developed. There is a spike in New Mexico on 
federal development, but states like mine are down. My state is 
down a half a million barrels. We have gone from 1.5 million 
barrels a day and we are down to about a million to 1.1 million 
day, and overall, the production in the United States is down 
under this Administration, not up. So I know you want to do 
that selectively to try to make your case, but it doesn't work. 
Prices are higher.
    We had Secretary Granholm in front of us and she agreed 
with me that more supply helps bring prices down. So prices are 
higher. So tell me, do you think more supply brings prices down 
or not? Would you agree with that or not?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, in 2022, oil production on 
federal lands in North Dakota was higher than in 2020.
    Senator Hoeven. But our total production is down half a 
million barrels because we are blocked from producing more on 
the federal lands, which you are now blocking us from doing. 
And remember, there is a lag between when you lease, when you 
get the drilling permit, and when you get the production. Okay, 
so by your logic then, by raising royalty rates and blocking 
production, which, again, you add more regulations to keep 
blocking us. You are saying that produces more supply. That is 
your argument. By blocking production on federal lands and 
increasing royalty rates, your argument is that is producing 
more energy?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, there is a process, of course 
to----
    Senator Hoeven. No, just, if you would just answer my 
question, please.
    Secretary Haaland. Oil production is up. Oil production on 
federal lands is at an all time----
    Senator Hoeven. Okay. So when you provide a lease, the very 
same day the production starts. Is that your argument?
    Secretary Haaland. No, Senator, obviously----
    Senator Hoeven. So if there is a whole lag process here and 
you are utilizing that to make an argument, you are also 
select--again, back to my question. So your policies to 
restrict development--the Chairman, his opening question to you 
was when are you going to allow production offshore?
    My whole question to you is, by blocking production and 
raising royalty rates, which is your policy, do you feel that 
produces more supply and lower energy prices? And the 
corollary--and actually, this time if you would please answer 
the question, and also, would you rather get that energy here 
at home where we have the best environmental standards or would 
you rather continue blocking it here at home and get it from 
places like Venezuela and other adversaries like OPEC?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, as I mentioned earlier, there 
are nearly 7,000 permits across the country that are not being 
used. Companies have nearly 400 approved permits to drill on 
federal lands and Indian land in North Dakota that they have 
not used. There are 226 approved permits on federal land and 
166 approved permits on Indian land in North Dakota. So I am 
happy to----
    Senator Hoeven. Many of which are blocked by your 
regulation or the courts where they have to litigate. You don't 
get a lease and produce it the next day, Madam Secretary. Would 
you agree with that at least?
    Secretary Haaland. Well, of course, and that is why, when 
the applications for permits to drill come into the Department, 
our staff works very hard to move those forward and they have 
done that since January 2021. They have moved those 
applications forward, and that is the reason why there are 
nearly 7,000 unused permits in our country.
    Senator Hoeven. Then why are energy prices higher at the 
pump?
    Secretary Haaland. I think there is a lot that goes into 
determine the cost of gasoline, Senator. I think you know that 
as well.
    Senator Hoeven. The consumer still pulls up to that pump 
and pays a lot more, and we need more supply.
    Secretary Haaland. And I understand. I raised my child as a 
single mom. I know what it is like to not have enough money to 
either pay your rent or pay your student loans or buy 
groceries. I get that. And that is why we are working hard at 
the Department to move our goals forward, to move these issues 
forward. There are 226 approved permits on federal land in 
North Dakota.
    Senator Hoeven. Mr. Chairman, one final question.
    A federal district judge has now ordered that you continue 
lease sales on a quarterly basis. Are you going to do it? He 
has ordered you to continue the quarterly lease auctions that 
you are holding up. Will you comply with the court order?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, we will follow the law to the 
best of our ability. Thank you.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator King.
    Senator King. Thank you.
    Madam Secretary, first I want to compliment the guy who is 
sitting to your right, Deputy Beaudreau, who was in Maine over 
the weekend, and through the implementation of the Great 
American Outdoors Act, to celebrate the building of a 
maintenance shed at Acadia National Park, which was desperately 
needed. A maintenance building, I should say, much more than a 
shed, but the point being that maintenance is important. And 
one thing that worries me about the National Park budget--as 
you know, we passed the Great American Outdoors Act and it was 
an incredible accomplishment to buy down the deferred 
maintenance in the National Park System. My concern is that 
although the budget seems to be moving slowly in the right 
direction, we are still way under where we should be in terms 
of maintenance funding. The rule of thumb in industry is you 
should be setting aside for maintenance two to four percent of 
your asset value. I think the National Park Service is at one 
percent, maybe. So I just commend to you for future budget 
consideration, we can't pass a Great American Outdoors Act 
every four or five years. And we can't keep digging the 
maintenance hole deeper. I hope that you will join me in being 
committed to that, to maintaining our public facilities rather 
than hoping to bail them out every so often.
    Secretary Haaland. Yes, of course. Having a handle on the 
backlog is certainly important to us. It is critically 
important. In fact, I am happy that Tommy was there. He 
actually stayed a little bit longer than he anticipated because 
of the plane situation.
    Senator King. Well, that is because he saw what a 
spectacular place Acadia National Park is.
    Secretary Haaland. But yes, the deferred maintenance 
backlog for last year was approximately $30 billion, and that 
is a decrease of $778 million from the year before. We know it 
is still significant, but we are working on it.
    Senator King. Well, my suggestion is, stop digging the hole 
by adequately funding maintenance on an ongoing basis. That is 
important.
    The second issue, and I think the Chairman may have touched 
on this, is permitting reform. We are not going to achieve our 
clean energy goals without permit reform. The Inflation 
Reduction Act cannot be implemented as long as environmentally 
sound projects are being in an endless cycle of permitting 
hell. I hope that the Administration will join us, as many of 
us are working on permitting reform, not to lower the 
environmental standards, but to develop practical, realistic 
processes to accelerate the process, and deadlines--meaningful 
deadlines--shortened and having one agency in charge. Are you 
committed and will you join us in an effort to achieve 
environmentally sound permitting reform in order to achieve 
long-term environmental goals?
    Secretary Haaland. Absolutely, Senator. Thank you. We are 
really working to do things in the right way, and of course, 
comply with our obligations at the same time, and we do that by 
making sure that folks are at the table from the beginning so 
that we don't have to go back and correct something.
    Senator King. That has been my experience. If people are at 
the table early and you can resolve these issues, then the 
process can continue in some kind of rational time. We are in a 
race with climate change and we can't afford 10 or 15 years to 
permit a transmission line or a pumped storage project or other 
environmental projects. What worries me is that we are viewing 
permitting over here in a kind of traditional way without being 
cognizant of the fact that in order to get where we want to get 
environmentally, we have to build things, and that is not the 
mindset that has been held, historically. So I hope you will 
work with us on this. I think it is critically important, 
again, to get to a clean energy future.
    One quick question. The RISEE Act, which talked about the 
allocation of offshore revenues, passed out of this Committee 
last year, and I hope the Department can support that bill as 
reported by the Committee. I know you had reservations as it 
was originally introduced, but I want to inquire about the 
position of the Administration on the bill as reported.
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, thank you so much for the 
question. Of course, we understand that this is an important 
issue for coastal states, and we certainly do want to support 
coastal states. I know the support of it requires more 
conversations with the Administration, and we are willing to 
have those conversations, and I look forward to working with 
you and the Committee.
    Senator King. Well, I want to point out that we are not 
only talking about oil and gas, we are now talking about 
offshore wind.
    Secretary Haaland. Indeed.
    Senator King. Which could be a significant resource for the 
coastal states, and so we will look forward to working with you 
on that. But I would specifically--you can take this for the 
record--like to get the Administration's position on the RISEE 
Act as reported last year. I believe it is something you can 
and should support, but I would like to have that on the 
record.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    And now, we have Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Madam Secretary, welcome back. You are not going to be 
surprised with the focus of my questions--all Alaska all the 
time, and let's start with King Cove. I do appreciate the 
engagement that your team had. The Deputy Secretary and--going 
out there, having the conversations. So recognizing that there 
has been some time that has elapsed now on these discussions, 
and your previous commitment directly to me and to Deputy 
Secretary Beaudreau's commitment that you will work to help the 
people of King Cove achieve a land exchange as well as this 
life-saving road that we have been talking about to Cold Bay.
    Can you give me any update on when you expect a 
supplemental EIS by the Department on this?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you, Senator. And the notice of 
intent for the draft supplemental environmental impact 
statement will be published very soon. I know that doesn't give 
you a specific date, but they are working on it and I believe 
it is in draft form at the moment.
    Senator Murkowski. Okay. I think we have all recognized 
that the schedule that we have discussed is a very aggressive 
one, and so the priority in advancing and meeting these 
benchmarks--timeline benchmarks, if you will--is 
extraordinarily important. And so I would just ask again that 
there be an imperative on moving quickly and efficiently, but 
also thoroughly.
    Secretary Haaland. Yes. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you.
    Let me turn then to another request for information on 
deadlines, and this relates to the Ambler Access Project. A 
couple months ago, I asked the BLM State Director for a 
concrete timeline to complete the additional analysis that was 
requested in that voluntary remand. Do you have a timeline for 
me that you can provide this morning?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, what I can say is that the next 
court filing is expected later this month, and any update will 
be provided to you then. We are happy to keep you informed.
    Senator Murkowski. So would you anticipate that BLM should 
have a record of decision (ROD) signed by the end of this year 
as has been promised previously in this Committee?
    Secretary Haaland. Yes, that continues to be the--yes, the 
ROD by the end of 2023. That continues to be the plan.
    Senator Murkowski. Good. Okay. That is the plan. We would, 
again, like to hear your commitment that you will seek to 
remain firm with this commitment because, again, I think most 
people would acknowledge that a timeline to study and permit a 
gravel road project in Alaska does not need to extend past 
seven years, and that is where we have been on this project.
    Another issue that is, of course, very, very familiar to 
you is the BLM/BIA conveyance and our Alaska Native veteran 
allotments issue. We had a chance to speak about this in 
Interior Appropriations, but I continue to remain concerned 
that the agencies don't have the capacity to meet the task of 
getting these allotment applications completed before the 
program expires in the end of December 2025. I want to make 
sure that they have the resources that they need. We got $4.9 
million in Interior last year. I am glad that the budget 
request continues that, but given the resources that you now 
have, what's the timeline for ensuring that all these 
applicants will have their applications processed within the 
deadline that we established under the Dingell Act?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, thank you very much for the 
question, and of course, you know this is a priority for us. We 
appreciate your support on the $5 million so that BLM can 
continue its work. I mean, we are making progress, and I have 
to believe that as we move forward that, like the first few, 
yes, they took a long time, but we should get a process down, 
and it will move more quickly. The Department of Veterans 
Affairs is helping us to locate veterans that we have not yet 
had a chance to locate because their contact information is not 
correct. And so currently, they are in process. A total of 266 
applications have been received. There are 95 in the survey 
process currently. We have issued eight certificates already 
and we are working with Veterans Affairs to get the contact 
information for 371 eligible veterans.
    Senator Murkowski. Well, there are some 2,900 veterans that 
we are focused on. I think you recognize that the number that 
is out there versus the number that have actually received 
their full allotments, it just doesn't measure up. And as we 
all know, our veterans are aging and passing. And so making 
sure that, again, there is an imperative to this, and my voice 
is calm, but you know, I hope you feel it in your heart that 
this is one where we have failed our veterans. And it is not 
just this Administration that has made multiple promises, it is 
other Administrations before. And we have failed our veterans 
in being able to keep this commitment to them.
    And so every day is important. Every dollar that we send 
this direction to get these agencies moving on this is 
important. And so I keep asking it. We keep pressing it as a 
delegation. We keep hearing commitments, but we need to get 
these veterans their due.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    And now we have Senator Hickenlooper.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Just in a nick of time. Thank you, 
Mr. Chair.
    The Chairman. Barely.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Secretary, thank you, again, for 
being here and thank you for all your work. As you know too 
well, the Colorado River Basin is experiencing what some people 
call a 22-year drought. I think some of the sedimentary records 
from the Grand Canyon demonstrate that we have seen less rain, 
less precipitation accumulation in the last 22 years than we 
have seen in almost 1,200 years. So it's more than just a 
drought. We appreciate the attention that your entire team has 
given. Even with the great snowpack we have had this year, I 
think we still can't take our foot off the pedal. We need to 
tackle this head-on and try to make sure we adjust this 
imbalance between supply and demand.
    Your Department recently released a draft document 
overviewing options on how to manage the water shortages 
through 2026, and I want to commend Camille Touton and her 
entire team in Reclamation. They have really been remarkable 
and have been everywhere, all over the Southwest. Deputy 
Secretary Beaudreau, framing these options as bookends, which I 
thought was excellent, that set the stage for the dialogue 
between the Basin states. I think to negotiate a settlement 
where we can get to a seven-state solution is critical to make 
sure we avoid what would become endless litigation. So how are 
those discussions going? I realize that you have a million 
different things going on at once, but I think within a broad-
brush effort, I wanted to have you bring us up to date.
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, thank you very much. As you 
know, we are committed to pursuing a collaborative and 
consensus-based approach. That has been our process so far. If 
it's okay with you, because Deputy Secretary Beaudreau has 
worked on this issue--I charged him with it--if it's okay if he 
answers the question, I would be happy for him to.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Absolutely.
    Mr. Beaudreau. Yes, thank you, Secretary Haaland. Thank 
you, Senator Hickenlooper.
    You put it exactly right. The supplemental EIS has a number 
of purposes, including providing context and impetus for those 
negotiations, which I am encouraged by. The talks continue. I 
am flying out, along with Commissioner Touton, to Phoenix 
tomorrow to continue those discussions with the Lower Basin 
commissioners. And so there is a lot of work to do. These are 
difficult issues, as everyone knows, but I am optimistic that 
we can get to consensus.
    Senator Hickenlooper. I have been delighted to see you 
being able to keep everyone at the table and everyone with a 
positive attitude, and I think that is a key.
    Now, I have two questions. Hard to pick which one I am 
going to go with, because I have wasted too much of my time. 
Let me go to our iconic landscapes in the West--well, across 
this nation, but certainly in Colorado we draw in 
recreationalists from across our state and our nation and the 
world, and your Department plays such a critical role in this. 
We obviously want to promote access to Colorado's beautiful 
lands. We also want to ensure that those access points are 
properly staffed and maintained. We know the National Park 
Service has faced serious staffing challenges in recent years. 
And for the staff that you have, finding housing is often a 
real challenge.
    What are you doing to ensure you have the workforce in 
place to properly manage these vital lands?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you for recognizing that, Senator. 
And as you know, since COVID, the number of visitors on our 
national parks and public lands has really exponentially 
increased. So yes, having the proper staff is important. We are 
working on that, and of course, that is the importance of our 
budget to hire more staff across the Department and certainly 
in our national parks. We also--let's see, the budget includes 
$117.8 million across multiple initiatives to support more than 
600 additional full-time equivalents, including more than 400 
to build park capacity for natural resource stewardship, 
address new and critical responsibilities at parks, and support 
the U.S. Park Police operations, which is incredibly important 
to all of our national parks. So we have a plan.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. I appreciate the able support 
on short notice. That is what I call great staffing.
    I have a couple more questions on wind, which I will submit 
for the record, and you can answer in the future.
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you very much.
    The Chairman. Senator Hawley.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thanks 
to the witnesses for being here.
    Secretary Haaland, if I could just start with you. I want 
to ask you about this memo from the Bureau of Ocean Energy 
Management that leaked a few weeks ago that suggests that your 
Department--I am looking at the memo now--it suggests that your 
Department has been prioritizing a climate change agenda over 
energy security in this country.
    [The memo referred to follows:]
    GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT
 
    
    
    Senator Hawley. I just want to get to the bottom of this 
and see if this is true. The memo concerns Lease Sale 258 in 
Alaska, the Cook Inlet project. And I just want to quote from 
the memo, which I have in front of me -- ``If the Cook Inlet 
prospect would be developed, there would be additional 
government revenues and greater energy security for the State 
of Alaska . . .'' -- the memo goes on -- ``nevertheless'' -- 
that is quite a transition -- ``nevertheless, because of the 
serious challenges facing the nation from climate change . . . 
BOEM is not recommending this option.'' And what the memo says 
is, is that the government ought to charge 18.75 percent in 
royalties, the maximum take allowed under the law instead of a 
lower rate that would actually lead to more development.
    Now, did you agree with this analysis?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, thank you for the question, and 
of course, royalty rates are such that, because our public 
lands belong to every single American, that Americans should 
get a fair return on the land that is used for this purpose.
    Senator Hawley. But did you agree with charging the highest 
possible rate in order to discourage bids on the project 
because of climate change?
    Secretary Haaland. There is--the royalty rates are, I mean, 
that is not a surprise. That royalty rate is evident in other 
parts of the country. And I will say that with respect to our 
Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, that is her department, 
that is her bureau, and I honestly--she takes care of that. She 
took care of that issue.
    Senator Hawley. Well, but you are the Secretary. So 
presumably you understand what's going on in your Department. 
This is an extraordinary memo, and I just want to make sure 
that I understand what your position is. The memo says that a 
lower rate--the 16.67 percent rate, to be precise--would have 
offered greater energy security. That is a quote from the memo. 
I have it. This is public. Anybody can read this. That would 
have offered greater energy security, but your Department 
recommended a significantly higher rate that you thought would 
likely lead, perhaps to not developing, not moving forward with 
the project for the purpose of climate change. You didn't want 
this to go forward. You didn't want Alaska to have greater 
energy security because you said ``climate change.'' I am just 
trying to understand. Do you agree with that analysis? And you 
did indeed impose the higher rate. In fact, the sale, Lease 
Sale 258 earned just one bid. So it looked like the strategy 
worked. I just want to know, do you agree with that, that we 
should trade off energy security for this country in favor of a 
climate change agenda?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, what I can tell you is that the 
royalty rate for the leases was the most reasonable balance of 
environmental and economic factors for the public and was 
consistent with the IRA requirements. Additionally, of course, 
yes, we are in the midst of a terrible climate crisis and it is 
our job to balance those things, to create a balance on our 
public lands because our public lands belong to every single 
American.
    Senator Hawley. Okay. That sounds like a yes to me. So you 
are telling me that yes, you think that charging more and 
trading off energy security, sacrificing energy security in 
favor of the climate change agenda is the right trade-off.
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, this royalty rate was 
consistent with the IRA requirement.
    Senator Hawley. Well, yes, it's the highest. It's 
consistent in the sense that you couldn't charge more than 
that. I mean, the memo lays this out. You selected the highest 
possible tax, essentially, in order to discourage development, 
and you succeeded in it. What's amazing is the memo--and now, 
listen, kudos to the person who wrote the memo because they are 
very honest. They say we could have energy security or we could 
have the climate change agenda. Energy security needs to be 
sacrificed, so let's go with climate change. And you are 
telling me that you agree with that.
    I just have to say, I think that is a disastrous trade-off, 
and I can't improve upon the comments offered by one Senator 
who said, ``I am appalled by the contents of this memo, which 
made crystal clear that this Administration is literally 
putting their radical climate change agenda ahead of the needs 
of the people of Alaska and the United States.'' That was the 
Chairman. He was absolutely right about that. Well said, Mr. 
Chairman.
    And I just want to register that I think that this decision 
to sacrifice our energy independence and energy security in 
favor of an agenda that is making us dependent on China, that 
is making us dependent on OPEC, that is making us dependent on 
every dictator around the world, is a disastrous choice for the 
working people of this country.
    My time has expired. I have some more questions, but I will 
submit them for the record.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Cantwell.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to you 
and the Ranking Member for this hearing. Madam Secretary, great 
to see you. Thank you so much for coming to the Pacific 
Northwest, visiting Mt. Rainier, the meeting with the Tulalip 
Tribe, and I really appreciate you visiting the Northwest. I am 
glad that we have someone at the Department of the Interior who 
believes in stewardship. I am not sure everybody gets 
stewardship, but it is about leaving the place better for the 
next generation, and my colleague Senator Collins and I had 
asked the GAO how much was climate change costing the U.S. 
Government, and it is in the billions of dollars. We have asked 
them to update that. I am pretty sure they are going to come 
back and tell us it is costing us trillions of dollars. So I am 
glad we are doing something about it.
    I wanted to ask you, though, about your work in the budget 
about Native American women who are experiencing violence and 
going missing. This week is the National Week of Action for 
Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women. This Friday is the 
National Day of Awareness. In my state, an organization did the 
report that showed how many women really are affected in the 
United States of America over this. This was several years ago. 
It really helped us move forward. Our attorney general has 
identified at least 113 unsolved cases in my state, of 
indigenous victims, and the Seattle Indian Health Board, which 
I mentioned, who issued that report on 71 urban cities found 
that Seattle and Tacoma have some of the highest cases of 
missing and murdered native women and girls in the country. So 
I know we have started to make change to address this crisis, 
but we need to do more. You helped create an initiative at the 
Department of the Interior, which I appreciate, and a task 
force, but we need to make sure that the resources are there. 
Some of these communities are immense and without much 
resource. One tribe in my state told me that they have only two 
law enforcement officers on duty to patrol a reservation of 
over one million acres.
    [Poster of Yakima Herald-Republic announcement of a 
gathering to be held Toppenish, WA in honor of missing and 
murdered indigenous women follows:]
 GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT
 
    Senator Cantwell. So I want to make sure that these cold 
cases don't go unanswered. I want to make sure that we are 
putting the resources together with this task force. So would 
tribal members in Washington State be better served if we were 
able to have federal resources in-state devoted to missing and 
murdered indigenous people in these cold cases?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, thank you so much for your work 
on this and for highlighting it. It is incredibly important and 
a priority for us, and that is why we--that is why I started 
the Missing and Murdered unit of the Department. And so far, 
since its creation in 2021, it has investigated 681 missing and 
murdered persons cases, solved or closed 204 missing persons 
cases, and solved seven murder cases. We have 32 of 63 of those 
positions filled. There are Missing and Murdered Units across 
the country. I believe there are a dozen of them across the 
country.
    And so that is a good start, and of course, we would love 
to continue the staffing on that and make sure that they have 
the resources they need to solve these cases.
    Senator Cantwell. What about a unit in the State of 
Washington, given it is such a high----
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you so much. Yes, and we 
understand that area has some of the highest missing rates, and 
certainly in small communities you can imagine if a dozen 
people went missing at one time. We are so happy to work with 
you on this, and we will take a look at what we have in the 
Pacific Northwest, but certainly, you raise an important issue 
and we are more than happy to continue to work with you.
    Senator Cantwell. Do you think we need more resources?
    Secretary Haaland. Absolutely. As I mentioned, we have 32 
of 63 positions now filled. They are planning to hire a 
supervisory agent in Washington State soon to add to the agent 
already on the ground. There is one agent there in the MMU. 
Sure, we could use more.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you. I think that is the answer I 
was looking for because clearly, we don't have enough resources 
here. We are a target. You know, we know that there is a lot of 
trafficking of women. We know that I-5 and vast amounts of land 
can lead to lots of different issues. So we need more 
resources. We need everybody working together to try to tackle 
this issue. So thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Barrasso [presiding]. Senator Kelly.
    Senator Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Secretary Haaland, I wanted to just take a moment here to 
discuss the Administration's budget priorities and how they 
relate to the Department's management of the Colorado River. 
Snowpack in the Colorado River Basin is--I think it's about 154 
percent above average. I think runoff is a little bit better 
than that. But that does not mean this drought is over--the 
worst drought in over 1,000 years, as far as we can tell. And 
one good year of snowmelt is not going to reverse 20 years of 
prolonged drought. It has left Lake Powell and Lake Mead at 
historically low levels. This is a long-term problem. This is 
why Congress has provided significant resources to the 
Department in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and in the 
Inflation Reduction Act.
    Can you provide an update on how the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act dollars are 
being spent and how much is left of that money? How much is 
left to address drought across the West both through 
infrastructure and efficiency upgrades through conservation?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you very much for the question, 
Senator. Of the $8.3 billion in bill funding through FY 2026, 
Reclamation has allocated about $1.8 billion to projects across 
the West for water conservation and recycling, more storage, 
rehabilitation of infrastructure, and so forth. This also 
includes last month's announcement of an additional $140 
million to fund 84 projects conserving over 230,000 acre-feet 
of water. We are also working quickly to use the $4 billion in 
funding provided within the Inflation Reduction Act, $150 
million for the Gila River Indian community. That saves about 
125,000 acre-feet of water, and about similar in `24 and `25. 
In the Upper Basin, $125 million out of a $500 million 
commitment is available for the System Conservation Pilot 
Program. And in the Lower Basin, we have committed $250 million 
to the Salton Sea.
    We are happy to get this all on a sheet for you and forward 
that to you with all the numbers, if that----
    Senator Kelly. That would be great.
    So there is about $6.5 billion left in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law to still be spent on western water 
infrastructure, is that correct?
    Secretary Haaland. You are better at math than I am, 
Senator. That sounds about right though.
    Senator Kelly. All right. Well, you know, this issue is not 
going away, and having one good year shouldn't make anyone feel 
like we have more time. We don't have more time.
    Secretary Haaland. We recognize that.
    Senator Kelly. Thank you.
    Secretary Beaudreau, you know, one action we took in the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was to substantially boost 
funding for WaterSMART grants, by $400 million. That is ten 
times what we normally do in an annual appropriation for that 
specific program. And these grants are important because they 
help farmers increase the efficiency of their irrigation 
systems. And I want to thank the Administration for proposing 
to increase these grants to $62.4 million. It is the highest 
proposed increase in this program since 2017.
    Unfortunately, these grants don't always make it to the 
communities who need them the most. For example, farmers in 
Pinal County have benefited very little from the WaterSMART 
program. Last January, they lost their entire Colorado River 
allocation. All the water they got from the river--gone. Now, 
that is a major agricultural community in Arizona so it is 
important not only for Arizonans, it is important for the 
country. And by some estimates, they have had to fallow about 
half of their farmland. So Secretary Beaudreau, as the 
Department advocates for this increase in WaterSMART grants, I 
would like you to look into what actions the Department or 
Congress could take to increase accessibility for Pinal County, 
specifically.
    Could you give me a commitment to work on this?
    Mr. Beaudreau. Yes, absolutely, Senator Kelly. And you put 
your finger on an important issue. We look at all the different 
programs and funding streams we have to meet a community's 
needs as well as get conservation deployed. And some of those 
tools don't match up with the needs of communities. And so, you 
absolutely have our commitment to continue to work to figure 
out how to get WaterSMART resources into the communities that 
need them.
    Senator Kelly. Yes, Pinal County was just hit really hard 
and early by the Drought Contingency Plan, as levels dropped 
below, you know, into Tier 2 of the Drought Contingency. So 
thank you.
    The Chairman [presiding]. I have just a couple questions, 
very quickly, for a second round.
    Just for the record, and this can be yes or no, but do you 
agree, Madam Secretary, under the IRA, the Department cannot 
move forward with offshore wind without holding offshore oil 
and gas lease sales? Do you understand they are tied?
    Secretary Haaland. Yes. Yes, Chairman.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    Secretary Haaland. Of course, we are going to comply with 
the IRA as written. We understand that it is tied to oil and 
gas development and renewable development, both onshore and 
offshore and we are----
    The Chairman. So both on and off, you understand? I just 
want to make sure.
    Secretary Haaland. Absolutely, yes, and we will do what it 
requires.
    The Chairman. You know, I am having just a little bit of a 
problem with the way they are interpreting some of this 
legislation. I am not blaming you all, but it's how it's handed 
down, but the law is the law and we are going to make sure you 
enforce the law, okay?
    Secretary Haaland. We will follow the law. Thank you, 
Chairman.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    The Compacts of Free Association--we talked about that 
briefly--are a crucial component to outcompete China and 
strengthen our alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, if you 
will. Congress must renew these Compacts. You talked about 
those briefly. They are set to expire on September 30 of this 
year. We have the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau. 
Marshall Islands has not been signed. We are going to probably 
proceed on the other two, is that your understanding?
    Secretary Haaland. Yes, Chairman, and I know that Carmen--
Assistant Secretary Cantor came to brief you last week.
    The Chairman. Yes.
    Secretary Haaland. And we are happy with the work that she 
and Ambassador Yun are doing on this and----
    The Chairman. Well, we are understanding--and you all can 
check this out--we are understanding there is $7.1 billion over 
the next 20 years, and every 20 years we have to ratify that. 
And that was the deal that was made. Micronesia gets $3.3 
billion at 140,000 people. You have the Marshall Islands--we 
thought we had an agreement at $2.2 billion for the 50,000 
people, and Palau has $760 million for 25,000. And also, on top 
of that, we have for the postal service, the U.S. Postal 
Service, with $634 million. I just think it is imperative we 
get this done as quickly as possible, but we shouldn't have to 
be held hostage by the Marshall Islands if they are playing for 
another angle, because I think they are disproportionately--
right now, with 50,000 inhabitants, they are getting $2.2 
billion, which has been agreed upon, but they don't think 
that's enough and they haven't accepted it. If you could keep 
us posted on that, where you are and what things need to be 
done.
    And if you wanted to just briefly say why you think this is 
so important. I mean, I think all of us understand the 
strategic and geographical, and with the geopolitical 
challenges that we are having in the Pacific, that seems to be 
our greatest desire--to get this accomplished.
    Secretary Haaland. Absolutely, Chairman. And I will just 
say that we have a really experienced team that has been 
working on this--Ambassador Yun and Assistant Secretary Cantor. 
She was the Ambassador in that area prior to coming to the 
Department of the Interior. She knows people on the ground 
there. And I trust them to do the best job possible and I think 
they are really moving forward in a good way.
    The Chairman. Let me just finish up real quick, and 
Secretary Beaudreau and Secretary Haaland, you can feel our 
frustration on what is going on here, you know, and I am just 
fighting it. It seems like we are fighting it every day of this 
Administration, truly having the desire to follow the laws 
because it requires permitting, it requires leasing, and the 
permitting needs to be done and we are going to have a 
permitting overhaul, but the leasing that needs to be done that 
puts things in action is all tied--we tied that to the IRA. You 
cannot, as we just said, you cannot do offshore wind, you 
cannot do onshore wind or solar unless we are extracting the 
resources the good Lord has given us, and we need it for a 
balance for the ten years.
    I would just encourage you all to do everything you can to 
basically accelerate, do it in a timely fashion, the leasing 
that you are supposed to do. It is going to help have the 
balance of renewables being able to do what they want to do 
also. We are just trying to find the balance. We are not trying 
to give anyone--and you are not going to be able to get what 
you want with renewables by delaying the leasing of our fossil. 
We just don't understand why we are having that challenge right 
now. I would encourage you to work with us, please, on time, 
get them on time so we can get things moving. We are going to 
be a year and a half late now. We don't see 2024 being very 
productive at all. And that is just going to basically hold up 
anything that renewables want to do offshore or onshore and 
BLM.
    Senator Barrasso, do you have----
    Senator Barrasso. Yes, thanks, I do, Mr. Chairman.
    So just following up with what Senator Manchin was just 
talking about--leasing. I want to talk a little bit about 
permits because two weeks ago you testified when you were 
testifying in the House that your Department is, ``committed to 
moving the applications for permits to drill, to move them 
forward as expeditiously as possible.'' And you said, ``and we 
have done that since I have been in this position.'' That was 
your testimony. I want to just point to a chart here. According 
to the Bureau of Land Management's official data--your 
Department--the time it takes to get an oil and gas permit has 
actually doubled under your leadership. In 2020, the average 
time was 130 days. In 2022, the average wait has jumped--
doubled to 271 days.
    [The chart referred to follows:]
     GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT
 
    
    Senator Barrasso. So my question is, why are you slow-
walking permits and then intentionally misleading Congress and 
the public when you are caught?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you for the question, Senator, and 
of course, I see this graph in front of me and there are a lot 
of factors that go into an application for a permit to drill. I 
don't process, personally, those applications. There is career 
staff who are dedicated public servants who do that. I think 
that number depends largely on how many applications there are 
at a time. Oftentimes, the career staff will contact the 
applicant to get further information, and they don't respond in 
a timely manner. There's any number of issues that happen, 
because each application for a permit to drill is separate and 
apart from the other ones. They look at each application 
separately. They process them separately, and I can say that 
they have told me that oftentimes they ask for further 
information from the applicant. They don't get it in a timely 
manner. That adds to the delay, Senator.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, your budget has been increased, and 
I don't think many people who are listening here believe that 
it's the companies who need these permits who are slow-walking 
the information back to you.
    Mr. Beaudreau, may I ask you to comment on this as well?
    Mr. Beaudreau. Yes, I think there are a number of factors 
in addition to what the Secretary described. We cannot get 
around the fact that litigation plays a role, and that is why 
we are committed to a thorough and rigorous and defensible 
process as we go through the leasing and permitting process 
because, as you know, if you really want to throw something off 
the rails, litigation is the way you do it.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, let me go back to the Secretary.
    Thank you, and I want to follow up on the litigation, but 
with the Secretary, because last month I sent a letter to you, 
along with Senator Lummis from Wyoming and Representative 
Hageman, about a lawsuit, about litigation that has been filed 
against oil and gas leases and permits in Wyoming, in my home 
state. And I have a copy of the letter that I sent to you.
    [The letter referred to follows:]
     GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT
 
    Senator Barrasso. The lawsuit targets leases and permits 
that were issued under your authority over the last two years. 
Will you commit to fully defending your own Department's 
decisions to issue these leases and permits in court? Will you 
commit to fully defending these?
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you very much for the question, 
Senator.
    Of course, our solicitor's department, they are the 
lawyers. They look at these lawsuits. I am happy to get with 
the solicitor's department to figure out where these are. I 
could not tell you where they are at the moment, in their 
review.
    Senator Barrasso. Yes, these are leases that you have come 
out with, and I would expect you and your Department to fully 
defend the lawsuits, defending your own action here.
    You know, in terms of coal leasing, last year a court 
reimposed the Department's moratorium, going back to 2016, on 
new thermal coal leasing, pending the completion of 
environmental review of the coal leasing program. Last week, 
your Department announced that it has started the environmental 
review. Do you have any intention to ever resume coal leasing 
on federal lands?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, I appreciate the question very 
much. I know that last week the BLM initiated the remedial 
environmental analysis of potential effects of maintaining the 
coal leasing moratorium. That is a process that is ongoing and 
of course, we are committed to working with all leasing 
applicants, including folks who are in this industry, and I 
believe that the moratorium does not apply to metallurgical 
coal.
    Senator Barrasso. There were a number of times today you 
say your goal is to follow the law. The purpose of the Mineral 
Leasing Act is to promote the mining of coal on the public 
domain. Do you believe that an indefinite moratorium on coal 
leasing is consistent with the federal law?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, I understand your concern, and 
I am happy to look at this issue. I don't----
    Senator Barrasso. And finally, and Mr. Chairman, I am going 
to submit this for the record. In one of my earlier questions, 
I was talking about specific rare-earth minerals--things that 
are needed--all minerals for electric vehicles, and talked 
about cobalt extensively. You had mentioned in your response 
that you looked at a mine and it had to do more with copper. I 
do have with me your Bureau of Land Management's National NEPA 
Register and the issues related to that mine. And it is very 
clearly stated that it was underground copper and nickel and 
cobalt. All of which I mentioned as critical minerals needed 
for electric vehicles that would be needed much, much more to 
try to meet the Administration's goals, and for which, right 
now, we are very dependent on international sources, some of 
which are mined in ways that we would find very much against 
the values of the United States.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    [The Twin Metals Minnesota Project Environmental Review 
Support Document from the BLM National NEPA Register referred 
to above appears in the Appendix of this hearing document, 
beginning on page 213.]
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Hawley.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I just want to come back, Madam Secretary, to this trade-
off between energy security and the radical climate change 
agenda that you have endorsed, which is a less energy security 
for America/radical climate change agenda. On the subject of 
the sweeping mandates related to electric vehicles that the 
Biden Administration has imposed, including now for our 
military, the metals needed to make the lithium-ion batteries 
in those vehicles are, of course, lithium, nickel, graphite, 
and cobalt. Now, can you tell me what nation is the largest 
producer of refined lithium in the world?
    Secretary Haaland. No, I can't.
    Senator Hawley. It's China.
    Can you tell me which nation is the largest producer of 
refined cobalt in the world?
    Secretary Haaland. No, Senator.
    Senator Hawley. It's China.
    Do you know what nation is the largest exporter of natural 
graphite to the United States, globally?
    Secretary Haaland. No, Senator.
    Senator Hawley. It's China.
    Secretary Haaland. Okay.
    Senator Hawley. So in all of these instances, these 
mandates, your decision to trade off our energy security in 
favor of a radical climate change agenda is making us more and 
more dependent on China, and at the same time, you are denying 
mining, blocking mining, blocking permits for mines in this 
country that would allow us to develop nickel and copper and 
cobalt. Why? Why block the development of these resources in 
our own nation in favor of making us dependent on China?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, are you referring to the 
Boundary Waters----
    Senator Hawley. I am referring to the Twin Metals mine in 
Minnesota that I think that Senator Barrasso was just asking 
you about.
    Secretary Haaland. Yes, near the Boundary Waters, which is 
an iconic place, and of course, a very valuable ecological 
system to many plants, animals, species----
    Senator Hawley. But jobs--let me just say this though. Jobs 
for blue collar workers in this nation are valuable resources. 
The livelihood and well-being of American families are valuable 
resources. The ability of America to have our own industry and 
not be dependent on China is a valuable resource. Why should 
those things for millions of Americans be sacrificed in favor 
of your agenda for radical climate change?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, I know that there are like 1.9 
jobs for every American in the country right now. So I know 
there are a lot of jobs.
    Senator Hawley. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a 
minute, wait a minute--you are telling me--you are telling me 
we have got too many jobs in the country?
    Secretary Haaland. Well, I am saying that we don't have 
enough people, that is why we are having a hard time finding 
folks to work at our Department----
    Senator Hawley. Oh, wait, you are telling me that we have 
too many jobs for blue collar work? Have you seen the number of 
jobs we have lost in this country to China in the last 20 
years? Do you know where those jobs come from? Over three 
million jobs have gone to China. Do you know where those jobs 
have come from? They have come out of midwestern towns, like 
the ones I represent. They are blue collar workers and you are 
sitting here and telling me that we have too many jobs in this 
country. Are you serious?
    Secretary Haaland. Senator, we are working hard every 
single day. There are--we have processed 20 mining 
applications, 20 mines or mining modification permits since 
January of 2021. We are moving forward. We are doing our jobs. 
We are fulfilling our mission for the----
    Senator Hawley. You are not moving forward. You are moving 
backward. You are shutting down and denying permits for mines 
in this country where we can develop our own resources. You are 
shutting down oil and natural gas permits. You are approving 
taxes and royalties that deliberately suppress American energy 
development in favor of a climate change agenda, and now you 
are sitting here and telling me we have got too many jobs in 
this country, we have got gobs of jobs in this country, we 
don't need any more jobs in this country.
    I want to take the strongest possible exception to that 
comment and to that entire mentality, which, I think, it is 
very honest. I think it reflects the mentality of your 
Administration, which is when it comes to blue collar workers 
in this country, you are on your own. Good luck. Good luck to 
you. We have got plenty, you know, just shut up and go get a 
job at McDonald's, you know, whatever. No more--quit 
complaining about the loss of American industry. I mean, good 
lord. That is extraordinary. What an extraordinary response.
    Secretary Haaland. May I say something, Senator?
    Senator Hawley. Absolutely. The rest of the time is yours.
    Secretary Haaland. Thank you.
    Contrary to that, we have created a number of jobs. We have 
an orphaned oil--orphaned gas program where we have capped 
orphaned oil and gas wells, and an abandoned mine reclamation 
project that has lifted whole communities up in reclaiming 
their mine lands that have devastated their communities. These 
folks have been out of jobs for years, and now, because of the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, because of the Inflation 
Reduction Act, they found new ways to engage and not only have 
jobs, but have a vision for what they want their communities to 
look like. We have plugged orphaned gas wells in peoples' 
backyards in Pennsylvania, and we are doing so in California 
and in Texas. These are things--these are communities that rely 
on this government to find a way forward for them. There is, 
unfortunately, a dearth of legacy pollution in this country. 
Those are jobs--good-paying, well-paying jobs with benefits 
that Americans are having because of President Biden and his 
policies. And we are proud to move those issues and those 
programs forward for the American people.
    Senator Hawley. My time is expired. I will just say in 
conclusion, again, trading off American energy security in 
favor of your radical climate change agenda, shutting down 
good-paying, American jobs in our energy sector and then saying 
the explanation is we have got plenty of jobs in this country, 
I think, is the most potentially--and this quite a high bar I 
might add--the most unbelievable statement I have heard from a 
member of this Administration, maybe in my time in the Senate.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    I want to thank all of you, again, for being here. I 
appreciate it very much.
    Members are going to have until the close of business 
tomorrow to submit additional questions for the record.
    The Committee is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:28 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
