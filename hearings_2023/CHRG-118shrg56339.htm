                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room

STATEMENT OF HON. DEBBIE STABENOW, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE 
    OF MICHIGAN, CHAIRWOMAN, U.S. COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, 
                    NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Good morning to everyone. I call this 
hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, 
and Forestry to order.
    Today, we are considering the nominations of Dr. Basil 
Gooden, of Virginia, to be Under Secretary of Agriculture for 
Rural Development, and the Honorable Summer Mersinger, of South 
Dakota, to serve a second term as a Commissioner of the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Both of these 
nominees were raised on farms and understand the needs of 
farmers, ranchers, and rural communities.
    I have three goals for the farm bill: keep farmers farming, 
keep families fed, and keep rural communities strong, and the 
role of Under Secretary of Agriculture for Rural Development is 
essential to all three. For the more than 46 million people who 
call rural America home, the USDA's Rural Development mission 
area is a pathway to revitalizing their communities, creating 
new jobs, and improving their quality of life.
    As we know, the climate crisis and a changing economy are 
placing significant pressures on rural communities. Addressing 
these challenges will be no small undertaking, but I know that 
Dr. Gooden is up to the task.
    Dr. Gooden has a wealth of experience. He currently serves 
as the Director of State Operations for USDA Rural Development. 
He previously served as the third Secretary of Agriculture and 
Forestry for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Virginia State 
Director for Rural Development at USDA, and as the Chief Deputy 
Director of the Virginia Department of Housing and Community 
Development.
    Perhaps most importantly, Dr. Gooden understands the needs 
of rural America because he is from rural America. He and his 
family still own and operate a cattle farm in his native 
Buckingham County, Virginia.
    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also plays an 
essential role in our economy by stabilizing costs to feed our 
families and power our homes. Derivatives markets provide 
farmers and producers with tools they need to manage their 
business risks as they face extreme weather events and 
implement more climate-smart agricultural practices.
    The derivatives markets are complex and constantly 
evolving, so the CFTC's work to safeguard market integrity has 
never been more important. The hardworking agency staff cannot 
do their jobs unless Congress does its job and provides the 
CFTC with sufficient, reliable funding.
    We must also ensure that that our financial markets are 
fair for all customers, not just the most sophisticated. This 
principle extends to the digital asset market. As Congress 
considers how to regulate digital assets, we will need to lean 
on the experience of the Commission to make sure we get it 
right.
    With that, I would like to welcome back Commissioner 
Mersinger. Hailing from a long line of Midwestern farmers and 
ranchers, she knows firsthand that agricultural commodities are 
the backbone of our economy and understands the importance of 
well-functioning derivatives markets.
    As the sponsor of the CFTC's Energy and Environmental 
Markets Advisory Committee, she hears directly from energy 
producers and consumers about the challenges of modernizing our 
power grid and transitioning to clean and renewable resources.
    With this experience, Commissioner Mersinger is well suited 
to help lead the CFTC.
    Dr. Gooden and Commissioner Mersinger are both extremely 
qualified for the roles to which they have been nominated. I 
look forward to supporting their nominations and working 
closely with them once they are confirmed. I will note that 
they both have received letters of support from multiple 
stakeholders, and I ask unanimous consent that these letters be 
entered into the record. So ordered, without objection.

    [The letters can be found on pages 38-44 in the appendix.]

    Chairwoman Stabenow. With that I will turn to my friend and 
Ranking Member, Senator Boozman, for his opening remarks.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BOOZMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF 
                            ARKANSAS

    Senator Boozman. Well, thank you, Madam Chair, very much, 
and today, as has been said, we are here to meet and listen to 
Dr. Basil Gooden, President Biden's nominee to serve as Under 
Secretary of Agriculture for Rural Development, and the 
Honorable Summer Mersinger, who is being nominated as a CFTC 
Commissioner. I want to thank both of you for being here, and 
we appreciate your service. Both of you all have excellent 
reputations.
    As the son of a farmer with roots in rural Buckingham 
County, Virginia, Dr. Gooden possesses a passion for rural 
communities that has underpinned his distinguished career. When 
he and I spoke earlier this week in my office, he told me story 
of his father dropping him off as a freshman at Virginia Tech, 
and telling him not to return home to the farm. He also 
reminded me that Virginia Tech had beat Arkansas in a bowl 
game.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Boozman. His dad told him not to return to the 
farm. Instead, his father recommended he go where the jobs and 
opportunity exist. It is understandable that comments like 
these would hit hard for a young man leaving home for the first 
time, and we appreciate that you have spent your career making 
opportunities for people to go back to the farm.
    Dr. Gooden draws upon these experiences in his current role 
as Director of the State Rural Development Operations at USDA. 
Throughout his career, Dr. Gooden has shown a willingness to 
work across party lines in the State of Virginia, having served 
under both Republican and Democrat Governors, most notably as 
the Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry for the State of 
Virginia.
    If confirmed, Dr. Gooden will be charged with the critical 
mission of improving the economy and quality of life in rural 
America through three agencies: the Rural Utility Service, the 
Rural Housing Service, and the Rural Business Cooperative 
Service.
    Much of rural America lacks basic necessities such as clean 
drinking water, sanitation, broadband, health care, and 
childcare, among others. Over the last decade, population 
decline has hit rural communities hard, compounding the 
difficulty of ensuring access to many of these necessary 
services. As residents leave for urban and suburban areas and 
municipalities lose access to tax dollars needed to improve 
water and electric infrastructure, cooperatives are asked to do 
more with less while maintaining affordable rates.
    Dr. Gooden, I trust you will draw upon your previous 
experiences and familiarity with rural Virginia to represent 
Americans well and work tirelessly to advance their interests.
    Turning to Commissioner Mersinger, she has served as a CFTC 
Commissioner since 2022, and before that served in other roles 
at the agency. That experience, along with her agricultural 
background, makes her especially qualified for this role. I 
especially enjoyed her visit to Arkansas last year where she 
got to meet with various Arkansas agriculture stakeholders.
    Through a pragmatic, principles-based approach, the CFTC 
has built and implemented constructive, workable regulatory 
frameworks for markets to function efficiently. Derivates 
contracts served as resilient risk management tools because the 
CFTC implements comprehensives rules, diligently polices the 
cash and derivatives commodity markets, and protects market 
participants.
    As the sponsor of the CFTC's Energy and Environmental 
Markets Advisory Committee, Commissioner Mersinger has 
championed resiliency of agriculture and energy markets, which 
are essential risk management and price discovery tools for 
those who feed and clothe us, and who provide reliable energy 
sources necessary to power our daily lives.
    Commissioner Mersinger has also led the call for regulators 
to deliver clear guidance in a timely manner in order to reduce 
risk. I have appreciated your perspective on no-action relief 
and your recognition that while no-action relief is a good 
thing, extending it over and over again without fixing a broken 
rule creates risk and uncertainty. I applaud Commissioner 
Mersinger for calling to codify repeatedly extended no-action 
relief, which ultimately would reduce uncertainty.
    I also hope that when the agency is going to extend no-
action relief, it makes that decision sooner rather than later. 
Waiting until the last minute to extend relief leaves market 
participants guessing and creates risk, especially in times of 
volatility.
    Finally, Commissioner Mersinger has also appropriately 
recognized the global nature of derivatives markets and the 
importance of open markets. She appreciates that barriers to 
market access reduce liquidity, increase hedging costs, and 
weaken market resiliency.
    Commissioner Mersinger is a champion for agriculture end 
users and ensuring the derivatives markets continue to serve as 
a viable risk management tool for this important constituency. 
I look forward to supporting her nomination.
    In closing, I am glad that we can hold this hearing today, 
and I look forward to getting you two confirmed as soon as 
possible.
    Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you so much. Before introducing 
our two witnesses I would like to turn to Senator Grassley, who 
I think has some comments that he would like to make.
    Senator Grassley. Yes. Madam Chairman, I ask for a point of 
personal privilege. I am only going to be here just for a short 
period of time because of a long agenda on the Judiciary 
Committee now meeting. I told the nominees I would submit my 
questions for answer in writing.
    I would like to talk about a member of my staff who has 
been working with you all here on this Committee for a long 
period of time. I would take a moment to commend a member of my 
staff, Joe Gilson, who is leaving my office for greener 
pastures after four years with my office. I hate to lose Joe 
has he provides me excellent guidance on ag, energy, 
environment, and trade policy. Joe is a native of the farming 
community of Prairie City, Iowa, so he came to my office 
knowing a lot about agriculture, or like I like to say, with a 
bit of dirt under his fingernails.
    Joe's time at Simpson College beefed up his interest in 
agriculture. During his four years in my office Joe rolled up 
his sleeves and got to work, holding countless meetings here 
from Iowans, crafting legislation to help family farmers and 
independent cattle producers, and promoting biofuels.
    I want to thank Joe for all of his hard work for the family 
farmers of Iowa and all of the people of Iowa, and we wish you 
well, Joe, in your next assignment. Thank you very much.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well, thank you, and Joe, why don't 
you stand up so we can give you----
    [Applause.]
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Wonderful. We wish you the best.
    All right. Our first nominee is Dr. Basil Gooden, and as I 
indicated before, Dr. Gooden is currently the Director of State 
Operations for Rural Development at USDA. Prior to this he 
served as Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry for the 
Commonwealth of Virginia and the Virginia State Director for 
Rural Development at USDA. Dr. Gooden has also served as the 
Chief Deputy Director of Virginia Department of Housing and 
Community Development, an Extension Specialist at Virginia 
Tech, and as a County Committee Advisor for USDA Farm Service 
Agency.
    Welcome, Dr. Gooden, and I now will turn to Senator Thune, 
who will introduce Commissioner Mersinger.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Madam Chair, both you and Senator 
Boozman for having this very important nominations hearing, and 
I am very pleased today to be able to introduce to this 
Committee again Commissioner Summer Mersinger, who has been 
nominated to serve another term as Commissioner at the CFTC.
    I have had the privilege of knowing Summer for I want to 
say going on 25 years now. She grew up in a small town in South 
Dakota, as has been noted, Onida, South Dakota, where her 
family continues to run a diversified row crop operation. She 
went on to study political science at the University of 
Minnesota. After she graduated she moved to Washington, DC, to 
work on my staff in the U.S. House of Representatives, and 
after stints on my campaign in the private sector she came with 
me to the U.S. Senate to serve as a member of my staff there.
    While serving in the Senate--and I think this speaks to her 
work ethic--she was working full-time in our office in the 
Senate, going to law school, got her law degree in 2007 from 
Catholic University's Columbia School of Law, and started a 
family. She was raising kids, going to law school, and working 
full-time in the U.S. Senate, and in every circumstance did it 
with professionalism, excellence, and integrity.
    I am delighted to be able to be here today to introduce her 
to the Committee. She has worked in the private sector at the 
Smith-Free Group, worked on a range of issues from 
cybersecurity to tax policy. She joined the CFTC on Chairman 
Tarbert's staff, as Director of Legislative and 
Intergovernmental Affairs and then went on to serve as then-
Commissioner Stump's Chief of Staff, and then last year the 
Senate unanimously confirmed Summer's nomination to serve in 
the CFTC Commissioner role, which she holds today. I hope we 
will move swiftly to confirm her reappointment to this 
important position.
    During her short time at the CFTC, she has been an active 
Commissioner. She leads the Energy and Environmental Markets 
Advisory Committee. She is also the only current Commissioner 
who comes from a farm family, which gives her a unique 
perspective on the importance of agriculture markets for the 
livelihoods of farmers and ranchers across the country.
    As you noted, Madam Chair, many ag groups across the 
country recently voiced support for Summer's nomination, and I 
think you have already asked consent to submit those letters 
for the record, but I would reiterate that request.
    Summer is a critical thinker. She is a problem solver. She 
is the, I would say, consummate example of professionalism. She 
will approach issues with an open mind. She is fair. She is 
honest. She is a woman of integrity. I think we are very 
fortunate that she is willing to continue serving in this 
important role at the CFTC.
    I know her husband Pat who is here today and her four 
children, Sienna, Sydney, Wyatt, and Drake, are all here as 
well, and I know they are very proud of her, as am I, and all 
of South Dakota.
    Summer, congratulations on your nomination. I look forward 
to considering your reappointment and working with my 
colleagues on this Committee and in the Senate to ensure that 
your confirmation moves forward. Congratulations. It is great 
to have you back.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well thank you, Senator Thune. Yes, 
absolutely.
    First, Dr. Gooden and Commissioner Mersinger, we have a 
couple of questions to ask, and we need to administer the oath. 
If you would stand and each raise your right hand.
    Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to 
provide is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the 
truth, so help you God?
    Dr. Gooden. I do.
    Ms. Mersinger. I do.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you. Second, do you agree that 
if confirmed you will appear before any duly constituted 
committee of Congress if asked to appear?
    Dr. Gooden. I do.
    Ms. Mersinger. I do.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much.
    Your testimony, as you know, will be made a part of the 
record. You can be seated. Thank you so much. We will now turn 
to Dr. Gooden for your comments.

 STATEMENT OF BASIL IVANHOE GOODEN, Ph.D., OF VIRGINIA, TO BE 
      UNDER SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT

    Dr. Gooden. Thank you, Chairwoman Stabenow, Ranking Member 
Boozman, and members of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Thank 
you for the opportunity to be with you today and your 
consideration of my nomination.
    I also want to thank my lovely wife of more than 30 years, 
Susan, and our daughter, Caper, who are both here with us 
today. I want to acknowledge and thank my six siblings for 
their support and encouragement, and I want to acknowledge my 
parents, Allen and Christine Gooden. Both of my parents were 
educators, my mother a home economics teacher and my father, an 
elementary school principal. Their influence has had a profound 
impact on my life and continues to guide me today.
    I am honored and humbled to have been nominated by 
President Biden to the position of USDA Under Secretary of 
Rural Development. I sincerely appreciate the support of 
Secretary Vilsack, and the support and friendship of Deputy 
Secretary Xochitl Torres Small, and former Deputy Secretary Dr. 
Jewel Bronaugh. I also want to thank the many farmers, 
ranchers, and landowners that I have worked with over the years 
who continue to provide insight and advice to this very day.
    I am a proud product of rural America. My family and I own 
and operate a beef cattle farm in Buckingham County, Virginia. 
There I learned the lessons of hard work, responsibility, and 
being a grateful steward of our land and environment. Down the 
road from our family's farm, my grandparents owned and operated 
a small country store that served our rural community for 
nearly five decades. Spending time there as a kid, I saw 
firsthand how the country store nurtured a sense of community. 
Looking back, I realize that this was far more than just a 
store; it was a vital institution in sustaining the health, 
social, and economic well-being of our rural community.
    As Ranking Member Boozman indicated, when my parents took 
me to college to attend Virginia Tech, my father gave me some 
profound advice. He told me to ``study hard,'' ``get good 
grades,'' and ``don't plan to come back to the country when you 
graduate.'' He said, ``There are no opportunities there, so you 
go to where the jobs are.''
    His words really stunned me and they stick with me to this 
very day. Throughout my career I have worked to level the 
playing field for rural Americans so that rural parents and 
their children have the same opportunities and quality of life 
as people in non-rural areas.
    I had the honor of serving as the third Secretary of 
Agriculture and Forestry for the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
There I worked with farmers, ranchers, landowners, and rural 
businesses across Virginia and across the country to advocate 
for and promote agriculture and rural businesses. In this work, 
I saw firsthand the rich diversity of rural America. I got the 
opportunity to travel the back roads of Appalachia, visit many 
small towns of the Black Belt, and many Tribal communities in 
the Midwest. Here I recognized and appreciated that rural 
America is not monolithic. Rural communities have their own 
unique strengths, needs, and assets.
    I have had the privilege of working in Rural Development in 
two different capacities. First, I served as the State Director 
in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and now I currently serve as 
Director of State Operations. I want to acknowledge that Rural 
Development has an outstanding, very knowledgeable work force 
that is dedicated to our mission in rural America.
    If I have the honor of being confirmed, I will work every 
day to advance the top priority of promoting rural livability. 
We will do this at Rural Development by ensuring that our 
program applications are easier for our customers to access and 
complete; better using technology to streamline our work; 
supporting and strengthening our work force; and building our 
partnerships to better deliver and leverage resources 
throughout rural America. Through these priorities, we will 
continue to work in advancing racial justice, equity, and rural 
prosperity.
    Across America, in every State, very successful people in 
every career field imaginable were raised in rural communities. 
I am committed to making sure that rural communities do not 
just produce talent that is invested in cities but they are 
also able to directly reap the benefit from the values, work 
ethic, and community spirit that rural communities have so very 
well cultivated. Like my grandparents and their country store, 
I am committed to promoting community connections that both 
matter and have a vital impact on the betterment of our 
society.
    Again, thank you for your time today and I look forward to 
answering any and all questions you may have.

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you so much.
    Commissioner Mersinger, welcome back to the Committee.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. SUMMER K. MERSINGER, OF SOUTH DAKOTA, TO 
 BE A COMMISSIONER OF THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION 
       FOR A TERM EXPIRING APRIL 13, 2028 (REAPPOINTMENT)

    Ms. Mersinger. Chairwoman Stabenow, Ranking Member Boozman, 
and members of this Committee, it is an honor to sit before you 
today as a nominee for a full, five-year term as a Commissioner 
of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. I am incredibly 
grateful to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for 
recommending me and to President Joe Biden for renominating me 
to serve as a Commissioner. On the heels of the Thanksgiving 
holiday, I count this honor as one of many blessings in 2023.
    As we continue to count our blessings during this holiday 
season, I want to take a brief moment to reintroduce those 
blessings in my life that are most precious to me, my husband, 
Patrick, and my four children, Sienna, Sydney, Wyatt and Drake, 
who are all joining me today. My four children are my live 
wires. They keep me on my toes, and I am alert for anything. 
While they are my live wires, my husband is my grounding wire. 
He makes sure I do not short circuit and completely burn out 
from the many power surges we experience as parents of two 
teenage daughters and two preteen boys.
    I also want to mention the love and support I receive from 
my parents, my siblings, and my many other family members who 
could not be here today but are joining us virtually. You have 
all blessed my life in so many ways.
    My list of blessings would not be complete without 
mentioning my rock-star staff: Chris Lucas, Terry Arbit, Libby 
Mastrogiacomo, LaTasha Pate, and my two student interns Tim 
Achinger and Izzy Mcilvenna.
    To all of the impressive staff at the CFTC, whether in 
Chicago, Kansas City, New York, or D.C. office, thank you. 
Thank you for your hard work, for your dedication, your service 
to the people of the United States. I fully recognize that I 
cannot do this job without you, and I am blessed to call you 
all colleagues.
    Blessed does not even fully explain how I feel when I look 
back over the journey that led me here. I am eternally grateful 
to the leadership of my very first boss, Senator John Thune. 
Senator Thune, you have always demonstrated how to be a leader 
with a strong moral compass; how to do the right thing, when it 
is the hard thing; and how to always remember where you came 
from. You also taught me how to be a humble servant to both God 
and country. Thank you. I wish I could also mention every last 
one of my former coworkers from Team Thune. They have all 
become my second family. You all know who you are, and you all 
know how important you are to me.
    Finally, to my fellow CFTC Commissioners, what an honor it 
is to serve among such a distinguished group. Russ, some days I 
am convinced you have the hardest job in Washington, but you 
always manage to lead with fairness, patience, and respect. To 
Kristin, Christy, and Caroline, I am still in awe of all of 
you. You inspire me daily, and I am blessed to not only call 
you my colleagues, but my dearest friends.
    Although only a year and eight months have passed since I 
last appeared before this Committee, it feels like a lifetime 
of experiences have blessed my term as a CFTC Commissioner. The 
term I served has prepared me and energized me to continuing 
this role for another term, if it is the will of this Committee 
and the U.S. Senate.
    As a Commission, we have demonstrated what can be 
accomplished when we work together in a bipartisan manner. In 
total, we proposed 12 new rulemakings for public comment; 
approved almost 100 enforcement actions, resulting in billions 
of dollars imposed in civil monetary penalties; and authorized 
over $34 million in whistleblower payments, demonstrating the 
success of this important program.
    We have collectively held 14 advisory committee meetings, 
including four held by the advisory committee I sponsor, the 
Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee (EEMAC). I 
am blessed by the commitment of the members and associate 
members of the EEMAC and its subcommittees, as well as the 
members of the CFTC's other advisory committees. These 
individuals offer their time to assist the agency in fulfilling 
our mission and help inform our work through their vast 
knowledge, experience, and expertise.
    Recently, I was back home in South Dakota during the final 
days of the fall harvest on my family's farm. As I watched the 
combine headers cut down the rows of corn and sunflowers, 
filling the hoppers with grain, I was reminded of the 
importance of the agriculture futures markets to farmers and 
ranchers across the United States. It is critically important 
for those of us here in Washington, DC, to remember that those 
farmers harvesting their fields took an enormous risk when they 
planted the seeds from which those crops grew.
    The agriculture futures markets are not only invaluable 
tools for price discovery but also for mitigating those risks 
inherent in production agriculture. Each and every day, I 
approach my work at the CFTC with those farmers and ranchers in 
mind, and should I be confirmed, I hope to continue to be a 
voice for agriculture at the Commission.
    To have this opportunity to continue in my current role and 
to be a part of the great things to come at the CFTC is a 
blessing beyond my imagination. Thank you again for this 
opportunity, and I look forward to answering your questions.

    [The prepared statement of Ms. Mersinger can be found on 
page 34 in the appendix.]

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well thank you very much to both of 
you, and let me start with Dr. Gooden and talk a bit about the 
fact that the USDA Rural Development is now responsible for 
implementing the largest investment in rural electricity since 
the New Deal. From the State of Michigan alone there is 
tremendous interest. We have over 215 applications from farmers 
and electric cooperatives and small businesses, requesting 
nearly $2 billion in clean energy funding. We know that this is 
going to create a lot of good-paying jobs also, which we are 
very excited about.
    Could you talk about your plan to use these resources that 
are available to Rural Development to both tackle the climate 
crisis and also ensure the timely and responsible allocation of 
these funds?
    Dr. Gooden. Well thank you, Chairwoman Stabenow. We 
certainly understand the vital impact that these clean energy 
programs have on rural America, and we are committed, in Rural 
Development, to ensure that we are employ aggressive strategies 
to make sure we hire people to actually allocate the funding 
that came through, certainly through our Powering Affordable 
Clean Energy (PACE) and New Empowering Rural America (ERA) 
programs, looking at if we can really impact the cost of energy 
in rural America, reduce the energy costs through these 
programs, that really helps rural America but also it improves 
our environment, which is always better for our farmers and 
ranchers. Also through our programs and some of bio-based 
programs, providing additional opportunities of revenue for our 
farmers and ranchers as well.
    With that three--reducing energy costs, cleaning our 
energy, and also providing additional revenues--I think that 
certainly is a benefit for rural America, and we are committed 
to working with our Rural Utility Service administrator and 
program to make sure that we meet the timeline to deploy these 
funds as Congress has intended.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you. You know, as we talk about 
new programs we are always hearing from small and under-
resourced communities about their lack of capacity to be able 
to apply for USDA Rural Development programs, and other 
programs within the USDA. Relying on State staff and technical 
assistance providers to get their applications over the line 
becomes so important.
    In your current role could you talk about common barriers 
you have seen communities face when trying to access Rural 
Development programs, and what should we be considering as we 
are writing the next farm bill, to address these barriers?
    Dr. Gooden. Thank you, Chairwoman. Capacity and being able 
to provide technical assistance to our customers to actually 
navigate the maze of our programs and sometimes our application 
process, it is a top priority of mine and the agency to reduce 
that burden on our customers. It is an equity issue, improving 
the access to our applications and making sure that our 
customers are able to complete these applications as well.
    Certainly there are several things that we are looking at 
doing. We are actually looking at strengthening our 
partnerships with our nonprofit organizations and other 
organizations that work in the rural economic development space 
across the country. That is a key priority of mine. Also hiring 
staff, really shoring up our field-based operations, making 
sure that where our customers engage with rural America on the 
ground that we have adequate support there for individuals.
    Looking at building a pipeline, again, to be able to 
provide the staffing, to provide technical assistance. We 
certainly understand, again, there are things we can and should 
do better at Rural Development, and making our application 
process easier for our customers is certainly a top priority.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Absolutely.
    Commissioner Mersinger, you have spoken about how energy 
markets are an area of focus for you at the CFTC. I have been 
concerned for a long time, and advocated, of course, for clean 
energy, and it is exciting to see that we are moving and 
creating these opportunities in rural America as well to tackle 
greenhouse gas emissions and create jobs and so on. We know 
that the derivatives market plays an important role in how we 
achieve all of these goals.
    In your view what is the Commission's responsibility for 
supporting the transition that we are involved in to a low-
carbon economy?
    Ms. Mersinger. Thank you for that question, Chairwoman 
Stabenow, and we do have an important role. I think the markets 
that we regulate serve a really important role in offering 
hedging opportunity. When you are looking at some of the costs 
involved in transition, hopefully it can help kind of smooth 
out that process.
    Our main job is to make sure those markets are functioning, 
whether it is for energy end users, farmers and ranchers, or 
those who are using our markets to hedge the risk costs of some 
of the underlying components that are needed for renewable 
energy and electrification.
    Those are all things we are looking at closely through the 
EEMAC committee, and my hope is that we can be contributors to 
the discussion and do what we can to make sure our markets are 
functioning in the role that they are meant to play.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you. Senator Boozman.
    Senator Boozman. Thank you, Madam Chair. Commissioner 
Mersinger, as sponsor of the Energy and Environmental Markets 
Advisory Committee you have championed ensuring the resiliency 
of agriculture and energy derivative markets. Can you talk 
about some of the work you have done to ensure these markets 
remain robust and resilient, and any future initiatives you may 
wish to pursue to ensure this goal if you are confirmed?
    Ms. Mersinger. Thank you for the question, Ranking Member 
Boozman. I was very intentional when I picked the EEMAC 
Advisory Committee as a committee to sponsor because, to me, 
one of the largest input costs for American farmers and 
ranchers is the cost of energy. Looking at those markets and 
how they work and how they serve end users is an important part 
of the discussion, especially when we are talking about a move 
to a net zero economy.
    Our role, the advisory committee role, is really looking at 
some of the newer metals that are important to renewable energy 
and further electrification, looking at some of the physical 
infrastructure related to energy and how that could impact our 
markets, and what that means for prices for the average 
consumer.
    Throughout all of those discussions it is very important to 
have farmers and ranchers part of that discussion. Any 
discussion of climate and improving our energy infrastructure 
needs to include America's farmers and ranchers who I often 
call the first environmentalists, to really worry about the 
environment and the work that they do to conserve soil and 
bring agriculture products to the general public.
    Senator Boozman. Very good. Thank you.
    Dr. Gooden, over 50 percent of counties in Arkansas, and I 
think 53 percent nationally, have lost population over the last 
10 years. This scenario is not, again, unique to Arkansas. We 
routinely hear about the lack of opportunity and capacity 
building to stimulate economic development. Can you provide 
examples of initiatives Congress or the Administration could 
pursue that could stem out-migration and generate sustained 
economic growth in rural areas?
    Dr. Gooden. Thank you, Ranking Member Boozman.
    Senator Boozman. What is the answer to the problem that 
your daddy posed?
    Dr. Gooden. Well, I have been mulling that solution for 
about 30 years now.
    Senator Boozman. I know you have.
    Dr. Gooden. I really do appreciate that question. The issue 
of the out-migration of population in rural areas is a major 
concern across the country. Rural Development has some 
significant programs and initiatives to shore up support in our 
rural communities. We have a Rural Partners Network that 
actually looks to work in some of the underserved communities 
that Rural Development may not have reached in quite some time, 
and it is an all-of-government approach. It is breaking down 
silos, not only across USDA, but it actually is breaking down 
silos across government, where we can bring more government 
resources to these rural areas with our Rural Partners Network.
    Really it is designed to help strengthen the capacity of 
these communities, not only to learn about our programs but 
actually to be able to take advantage of not only Rural 
Development programs but programs at SBA, EDA, and other parts 
of the government.
    We are working very diligently to bring the resources of 
the Federal Government and to partner with State and local 
municipalities to actually make sure that rural counties can 
avail themselves to the opportunities that we have here in the 
Federal Government.
    Senator Boozman. Very good. Thank you. I have got some more 
but I will submit those to the record, in the interest of time. 
Thank you, guys. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Before proceeding 
I understand Senator Marshall would like a moment of personal 
privilege. We are not sure what this is.
    Senator Marshall. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you so 
much. I know the Ag Committee has been watching with bated 
breath the upcoming Farmageddon bowl game between Iowa State 
and Kansas State. I just want to congratulate Senator Ernst and 
Senator Grassley for a well-played game. They took it to us. It 
has been going on for 100 years, Farmageddon. In case you 
missed it, Farmageddon bowl game. It is usually the Saturday 
before or after Thanksgiving.
    I just want to present the trophy this year to Senator 
Ernst and Senator Grassley and make this a new tradition for 
the Ag Committee, as we pass this trophy back and forth. 
Senator Ernst, on behalf of Iowa State, congratulations.
    Senator Ernst. Madam Chair, I want to congratulate my 
Cyclones. Go Clones. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. We are happy to accept this new 
tradition of the Committee.
    [Applause.]
    Chairwoman Stabenow. All right.
    Senator Ernst. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Absolutely.
    Senator Ernst. It is a Newhall one. Where is my John Deere?
    Senator Smith. Madam Chair, maybe it would be possible to 
move the microphones and we could have a little drag race.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. We could.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Smith. I am sorry. I did not mean to----
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Do not give him any ideas. I have a 
feeling.
    Senator Marshall. My bad. My bad.
    Senator Smith. There we go. I love it. Great. Well, thank 
you, Madam Chair and Ranking Member, and welcome to the 
Committee. It is wonderful to see both of you, and thank you 
for your service.
    I would like to start with Dr. Gooden, and I want to talk 
with you a little bit about rural housing. I think we all know 
that if you do not have a safe, affordable place to live, 
nothing else in your life works--not your job, your education. 
Nothing in your community works. We also know that there is a 
shortage of housing in rural communities, and that is a huge 
barrier for families and for businesses that want to expand in 
rural communities. There is also a real shortage of affordable 
housing stock. Places where our seniors, people living with 
disabilities, and also folks working in low-wage jobs are 
living.
    Senator Rounds and I have been working closely on looking 
at some common-sense reforms to the Rural Housing Service, 
which has not really been looked at for really quite a long 
time. I want to thank the Department and the Rural Housing 
Service staff for the very useful technical assistance that 
they have provided us. I am glad to say that this bill that 
Senator Rounds and I have been working on now has 10 co-
sponsors on the Banking Committee, which all has jurisdiction 
over this, five Republicans and five Democrats.
    I want to dive into this a little bit. One of the things 
that we learned as we did a lot of outreach on this is that the 
Rural Housing Service struggles with outdated technology which 
makes it very difficult for the folks to do their jobs, and it 
makes it very difficult for the private sector to interact with 
the Rural Housing Service.
    Dr. Gooden, could you just talk a little bit about the role 
that this Rural Housing Service plays and the role that housing 
plays in attracting folks to rural communities and what we need 
to do to ensure that we keep that stock of affordable housing 
in community?
    Dr. Gooden. Good morning and thank you so much, Senator. I 
am excited about that question. I share your concern and your 
interest in rural housing. Much of my career at the State level 
was with the Department of Housing and Community Development. 
One of the first things that I did as a State Director in 
Virginia in Rural Development was actually analyze our single-
family housing program to make sure that we were able to deploy 
our program across the State of Virginia, to put people in 
safe, decent, clean, affordable housing in Virginia, 
understanding housing is more than just a home, that actually 
it impacts health as well. Housing is a stepping stone to 
accumulating wealth as well.
    Housing plays so many important parts in rural America. I 
certainly will commit to working with our Rural Housing Service 
administrator, but also partnering with our rural housing 
partners such as HAC and other organizations to really address 
these issues of rural housing. I certainly understand.
    One thing I do want to share is that our Single-Family 
Housing Direct Loan Program this year had a banner year of $1.7 
billion. We are doing some good things with our program, but I 
think we can certainly do more, and I do share your concern and 
look forward to working with you, your staff, and other Members 
of Congress to better deploy our housing services across rural 
America.
    Senator Smith. Thank you very much. I look forward to 
working with you on this as well and talking with you more, 
Madam Chair and Ranking Member, and other members of this 
Committee about this issue and this legislation. I am hoping 
there will be an opportunity for us to make some progress on 
this in the coming months.
    Ms. Mersinger, I would like to just quickly, in the time I 
have left, let you know that in preparation for the hearing we 
had an opportunity to hear from some grower organizations in 
Minnesota, and the Minnesota Corn Growers, in particular, asked 
that I pass along a thank-you for your commitment to 
establishing good, regular communications with them through the 
CFTC's Agriculture Advisory Committee. Thank you for that. It 
means a lot for people to feel as if they have somebody that 
they can connect with and express their views to, so I am 
grateful for that.
    I think we all know that consolidation in the ag sector is 
a significant problem, both on the input side as well as on the 
processing side. Also we continue to see lots of mergers in 
this sector, and it is very concerning to a lot of us on both 
sides of the aisle.
    You all play a big role in commodity price discovery. I 
know you do not have oversight over there mergers, but could 
you just talk a little bit about whether you think that there 
is a role for the CFTC to play to help producers that are not 
getting a fair market value for their products because of this 
price transparency issue?
    Ms. Mersinger. Thank you for the question, Senator Smith, 
and although I am from South Dakota I did spend a lovely four 
years in Minnesota at the University of Minnesota. My husband 
is also a Golden Gopher, and he grew up in Minnetonka. 
Practically a constituent.
    To your question on consolidation, especially in the 
agriculture markets, it is something that we pay attention to. 
The underlying fundamentals of especially the agriculture 
complex markets really do have an impact on the price discovery 
role that our markets play. It is something we have to pay 
close attention to, be aware of, and make sure that at the end 
of the day our markets are adequately reflecting the price of 
these markets.
    That is something that we are thinking about, something 
that we are looking into. Another kind of aspect of 
concentration here has to do with futures commission merchants, 
which is kind of the onramp to some of these markets. We have 
seen significant drop in numbers in FCMs, and that is something 
that we are paying attention to. I think we have some 
opportunities to look at ways where we could see if there are 
barriers to entry and just make sure that we are allowing 
farmers and ranchers to have full access of the markets so they 
can hedge their risk.
    Senator Smith. Thank you very much. A complex question. I 
appreciate you. Thank you, Madam Chair, for your forbearance.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Absolutely. Senator Ernst, I do not 
know if you have other trophies or awards or speeches you would 
like to make.
    Senator Ernst. Well, next year, I will be keeping it 
probably next year too. Thank you. Congratulations again to 
Iowa State, and thank you, Dr. Marshall, very much for a little 
bit of levity. It is always appreciated. Thanks, Madam Chair 
and Ranking Member, and as well to our witnesses, Dr. Gooden 
and the Honorable Mersinger. Thank you very much for your 
testimoneys today. I really appreciate it.
    I have shared many times before, but I grew up on a small 
family farm in southwest Iowa, and you could often find me 
either feeding the hogs or walking soybeans. I would like to 
say they were fond memories, but maybe a little bit of 
nostalgia now. It was a lot of hard work, and I experienced 
firsthand the type of work that goes into production 
agriculture, and my folks taught me the values of service and 
sacrifice.
    I have gone through your biographies, we heard them here 
today, we have heard your remarks, and I am so encouraged that 
we have such phenomenal nominees before us today that have that 
similar background that I had growing up in southwest Iowa. You 
truly do understand the complex challenges that are facing 
rural America today. I really appreciate that.
    Dr. Gooden, on your cattle farm, God bless you, and then, 
as well, Ms. Mersinger, growing up in South Dakota and having a 
similar experience. We really do need more dedicated 
individuals like you that are stepping forward and serving our 
country in these types of positions. I know and understand that 
both of you will not only want our small rural communities to 
survive but you want them to thrive. That is why I am excited 
that you are here.
    I always do get a couple of questions as I am out and 
about. I travel Iowa, hit all 99 counties every year on my 
River to River Tour. If we can address some of those questions 
today, and Dr. Gooden, I will focus a lot of the questions to 
you.
    We do have a number of companies in Iowa that will turn 
corn, soybeans, and other plant-based feedstocks into a broad 
spectrum of everyday products. USDA's BioPreferred Program 
represents a very important tool for our Federal Government to 
spur private sector innovation. This adds value to the crops 
that farmers are producers, and it also builds our national 
security.
    Dr. Gooden, will you commit to supporting this important 
program, again the USDA BioPreferred Program, and working 
across the Federal Government to improve the reporting, data 
collection, and procurement opportunities for those products?
    Dr. Gooden. Thank you very much, Senator Ernst. I am very 
excited about our BioPreferred Program, and I will certainly 
commit to making sure that that program has the resources and 
attention that it needs to make the impact that Congress 
intended. We are excited both about the labeling aspect of the 
BioPreferred Program and also the procurement preferences as 
well. Very impactful program, and it is making a big difference 
in rural America, as you so noted. Again, very excited about 
that program, and looking forward to moving that forward.
    Senator Ernst. Outstanding. I appreciate that because 
overall the U.S. is falling behind when it comes to 
prioritizing that ag-bio economy environment. I would love it, 
as well, if you would commit to educating others within the 
Administration about the incredible opportunity that we have. 
Do you commit to do that as well?
    Dr. Gooden. I do. Thank you, Senator Ernst. Any time that 
we can sing the praises of the impact, certainly for our 
farmers and ranchers, again, the benefits of the additional 
revenue streams for them, I am all in. Thank you so much for 
your support.
    Senator Ernst. Thank you. Dr. Gooden, Iowa continues to be 
a leader in renewable energy, and ethanol production 
specifically is something I feel very strongly about. Home-
grown biofuels are very critical to our farmers and our 
consumers, and especially when we are working to lower costs at 
the pump. The Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program, 
HBIIP, has been a useful tool for helping convenience stores 
purchase the infrastructure needed to support these higher 
blends of fuels, such as E15 and E85.
    If confirmed, can you commit to continuing this program and 
ensuring that consumers are provided with higher blend options, 
which are oftentimes much lower cost at the pump?
    Dr. Gooden. Yes, ma'am. I certainly commit to that. We have 
a fantastic team in our Rural Business-Cooperative Service 
really focused on this and this program, making sure that it is 
making the impact that it is desired to do, and they are 
committed to doing that, great team at U.S. Rural Development 
to do that.
    Senator Ernst. Wonderful. Well, I appreciate that. I see 
that I am running out of time. I do have a number of other 
questions that have come from constituents. I will submit those 
for the record, things such as childcare as well in the rural 
areas and how we are working to improve that situation.
    To both of our nominees, thank you very much. I really 
appreciate you. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you so much. I have raised the 
issue on the biobased economy with Dr. Gooden as well, so I am 
so glad that you have raised that. There are a whole lot of 
jobs and opportunities in this area.
    Next, Senator Marshall. Excuse me. I am sorry. Wait just a 
second. Senator Bennet.
    Senator Bennet. With your permission, Madam Chair, I defer 
to Senator Marshall if I could go after him.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. You may. Yes. There you go. Merry 
Christmas.
    Senator Marshall. Thank you so much, and we are going to 
keep working on those water issues in Colorado and Kansas.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. That is right. That is right.
    Senator Bennet. Thank you, neighbor. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Senator Marshall.
    Senator Marshall. Thank you, Madam Chair. I will start off 
with Dr. Gooden. Now before you answer this question I want you 
to know that my mom's family raised Hereford cattle and my 
dad's raised Angus beef cattle. What type of cattle do you 
raise?
    Dr. Gooden. We are pretty agnostic on the cattle. No, we 
and my family raise Black Angus beef cattle.
    Senator Marshall. That is a great choice. It is all good to 
me. Contrary to what the United Nations is saying, I am so 
proud that American farmers and ranchers grow beef with less of 
a carbon footprint than anybody else in the world does, and I 
think it is a pretty good protein source as well.
    Dr. Gooden, if you could do one thing in the next six 
months that would help rural America, what would it be? Maybe 
two things, one or two things.
    Dr. Gooden. Senator, I really feel that rural America, 
actually the loss of the population in rural America. Really 
promote rural livability, making sure that people understand 
that rural America is not just a place that produces energy or 
things that you can extract products from, that that actually 
is a place that you can live, raise a family, and actually work 
and have a livable wage. Really, again, just promote that.
    If you are talking specifically through our programs and 
rural America what I would do in the next six months, I would 
focus heavily on our staffing, making sure our staffing is 
adequately supported in our field-based operations, where we 
meet the customers there on the ground, to make sure that they 
understand our programs and can access our programs. That is 
what I would do through rural----
    Senator Marshall. Thank you, Dr. Gooden. You know, as I 
listened to your testimony I was reminded that you laid out 
some really good goals that you could do. You are representing 
the government. Other than making it rain, the biggest thing 
the Federal Government could do is help drive the interest 
rates down. That is what is impacting rural America probably as 
much as anything right now. Our interest rates, we were paying 
one percent for operation loans, now nine percent. That was the 
profit.
    At the bigger level I just hope that you would use your 
megaphone to tell the White House that we cannot keep spending 
so much money and printing dollars that leads to high interest 
rates as well.
    Last I do want to ask about childcare. Senator Ernst kind 
of brought it up as well. If we expanded USDA loan program to 
include childcare facilities, would that be of use?
    Dr. Gooden. Oh yes, sir, Senator, and certainly our 
Community Facilities Program, actually we invest in community 
facilities, health care clinics in rural areas, hospitals as 
well. Certainly educational opportunities.
    Senator Marshall. Right now--so I understand we cannot do 
childcare centers. I think that would be something great to 
think about on a farm bill is expanding what the USDA could 
loan money on, to include some type of childcare facilities. 
They are just not profitable, so we could give them or help 
loan them a facility. Perhaps it would work out as well.
    Next I will turn to Commissioner Mersinger. Thank you 
again. I am going to start--your children came with you. I am 
going to pass on some advice to your children. Okay? Now listen 
to this. Mark Twain said, ``When I was 15 my dad was the 
dumbest man I had ever met.'' By the time he turned 23 he had 
learned a lot. As you are fighting with your mom and your dad--
the girls tend to fight with their mom, the boys fight with 
their dad--just remember that, that over the next seven or 
eight years your mom and dad are going to learn a lot.
    I appreciate, Commissioner, your commitment to family. I 
think about rural America and I think those family values are 
so important. I appreciate you bringing them here and letting 
them see what Mom does for a living, and what you do is 
important, that the farmers and ranchers back home use 
commodity futures as part of their risk management. They seldom 
have a concern but we have got one going on now. I am going to 
have to turn to my notes because this is a little bit more 
complicated.
    I want to talk about live cattle future prices for a 
second. They just seem to be out of whack. I have never seen 
such a divergence in the prices, and we do use these. Our 
feedlots, I do not know, 25 percent of the beef in the country 
comes through our feedlots in southwest Kansas as well. The 
swing in prices is damaging to producers.
    What is the economic basis for this big swing that is 
happening, and heaven forbid, is there any type of evidence of 
market manipulation going on here? Is there any chance that 
there is market manipulation going on? It just does not make 
sense to us.
    Ms. Mersinger. Thanks for that question, Senator, and I 
grew up on a cattle ranch. I spent the first 14 years of my 
life on a cattle ranch actually picking rocks for fun. 
Definitely I understand the challenges, and I know how 
important the futures markets are for cattle producers in 
providing that price discovery.
    We have very well-qualified, very smart analysts who are 
watching these markets day in and day out, monitoring----
    Senator Marshall. What are the economics behind it?
    Ms. Mersinger. You know, the agriculture markets are very 
sensitive to underlying fundamentals, and as you know, the 
pricing aspect and how prices are reported in the cattle 
markets, there are a number of questions around how that is 
formulated. That is not within our jurisdiction, but certainly 
it impacts our futures markets. Certainly we are willing to 
work with USDA, willing to work with this Committee to see if 
there are things that need to be changed, and certainly if 
there is anything that needs to be changed within the contract 
specifications for the----
    Senator Marshall. If there was market manipulation going on 
do you think that you could see it? Could you figure it out? 
Are you concerned there is market manipulation?
    Ms. Mersinger. I do feel strongly that we would be able to 
see it if there was manipulation in the futures markets. Not 
only are we surveying for that but also the exchanges. That is 
part of their role. I do think, you know, when we see fraud and 
manipulation we put an end to it. We go after the bad actors. 
It is also on the exchange to ensure that these markets are not 
susceptible to fraud and manipulation. That is part of their 
core principles.
    We are looking into it all the time, and certainly happy to 
work with your office and this Committee to see what we can do 
if there are things that can be done to better--make sure these 
markets serve their purpose.
    Senator Marshall. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Senator Bennet.
    Senator Bennet. Thank you. Promises made, promises kept. 
Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair, and to the Ranking Member 
for holding this hearing, and thank you to our nominees for 
your willingness to serve and to testify before the Committee.
    Dr. Gooden, your predecessor, and now the Deputy Secretary 
of Agriculture, made a point to visit Colorado during her 
tenure as the Under Secretary for Rural Development, and we 
appreciated it. I hope you will make it a priority to visit 
Colorado as well and to meet with our farmers and ranchers and 
community leaders, business owners who are working hard to keep 
Colorado's rural areas vibrant.
    A topic that I have raised over a long, long time in this 
Committee, and it continues to be a challenge for rural 
Colorado communities, is the burdensome red tape that is 
holding back Rural Development programs. Whether it is the 
Community Facilities Program that helps rural health clinics in 
the San Luis Valley or Clean Energy Development in northwest 
Colorado or Rural Housing on the Eastern Plains, this trend 
cannot continue if we want to be successful in lifting up our 
rural communities. Our rural communities do not have time to 
get drowned in the red tape that they are suffering from.
    I would ask you, Dr. Gooden, if confirmed as Under 
Secretary how you will work to reduce the burdensome 
application and contracting requirements for the USDA Rural 
Development programs?
    Dr. Gooden. Thank you, Senator Bennet. I will commit 
certainly to come to Colorado, in the footsteps of Deputy 
Secretary Xochitl Torres Small.
    Senator Bennet. Thank you.
    Dr. Gooden. I certainly understand and appreciate your 
question related to the red tape. One of the top priorities 
that I have at Rural Development is really making our 
application process far easier to access and complete, whether 
that is working with our rural partners to provide technical 
assistance--and again, shoring up the support of our staff 
there on the ground in Colorado and across the country to make 
sure that they can help applicants better understand that 
process. I mean, there is a maze, sometimes, of programs that 
small towns sometimes do not really understand exactly some of 
our programs and the benefits that they can bring to their 
area. Making sure that our staff is able to come out and meet 
these individuals where they are, in these small towns and 
municipalities.
    Senator Bennet. Yes. I would say maybe another way of 
saying that is that small towns do not have the resources the 
big municipalities have to hire people whose only job is to 
figure out to get themselves through the USDA red tape and 
through these complicated processes. They do not. They cannot 
afford to do it, and it is not fair for them to have to do 
because it shuts them out of the process, and they are the ones 
that need the help the most.
    I will take you on your commitment. I believe it. I have 
made this offer to your predecessors and I will say it again. 
If there are things we can do to change the way the law is 
written to help make your job easier, you should not have to 
hire a bunch of lawyers and accountants to get through these 
forms. You should not have to do it. You know, your average 
small town in America should be able to do this. Your average 
producer should be able to do this. If they cannot it is not 
their fault; it is our fault.
    Unfortunately the problem is people here, they come for a 
job, they stay for two or three years. I am not criticizing you 
in any way. That is just is the way this works. The people at 
home are still doing the same thing they were dealing with 
three years ago or five years ago, 10 years ago. I would like 
to build a statue to you if you could figure out how to get 
some of this stuff done and whatever I can do to help.
    Let me also use this as a chance to express my appreciation 
for all the work the Rural Development team as USDA is doing to 
roll out the new Inflation Reduction Act Clean Energy Programs. 
With the IRA, we made the single largest investment in rural 
electrification since the New Deal. I am particularly excited 
about the New ERA Program, nearly $10 billion to help rural 
electric co-opioids transition to clean energy.
    I know that the program, not surprisingly, is significantly 
oversubscribed. It is great to see how much interest there has 
been. Colorado co-ops are poised to lead the clean energy 
transition in rural America, and I hope USDA will give their 
applications full and fair consideration. I think New ERA has 
the potential to fund larger renewable projects and even 
position rural co-ops to own projects for the first time, which 
they have never been able to do. That is going to provide huge 
value to rural communities for their long-term economic value.
    I have been hearing concerns about how projects are going 
to make it through the NEPA process, or whether they will ever 
make it through the NEPA process in a timely manner. I would 
ask you, outside of increased staff capacity, which of course 
is going to be difficult to find at the agency for 
environmental review, in your experience what can USDA do to 
speed up the NEPA review process for the New ERA program? Well, 
let me stop there and see if you have got an answer.
    Dr. Gooden. Thank you, Senator. I certainly understand the 
frustration and the challenges that are being encountered 
related to our environmental review process. That is something 
that Rural Development has been taking very seriously, looking 
at strategies to improve that, the environmental review 
process.
    Actually, we did hire some additional staff to really focus 
on that. We have a task force that actually has been created, 
actually over a year ago now, working to provide 
recommendations to address the environmental review process. We 
have contracted with others to help us be able to complete 
those environmental review processes, to move those Rural 
Development projects forward.
    We are giving this serious attention, Senator, but we 
certainly welcome the input and the feedback. I certainly do 
not take any comments as any criticism at all. We need to hear 
certainly things that we can do better. We look forward to 
working with you, your staff, and other Members of Congress to 
really address these issues, certainly around environmental 
reviews and other issues as well.
    Senator Bennet. Thank you. We look forward to that, and 
Madam Chair, thank you for the opportunity to ask these 
questions. Thank you for being here.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Absolutely, and let me echo the 
paperwork. Both Senator Boozman and I have talked extensively 
about this, and with our Deputy Secretary now as well, about 
the importance of streamlining the paperwork for communities 
and farmers and so on, to be able to get the services that are 
so important that are being offered.
    Senator Tuberville.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you, Madam Chair. 
Congratulations. Thanks to both of you for being here. Very 
impressive families. It is good to see them here too.
    Before I get started, Dr. Gooden, I have always wanted to 
ask this question. The son of a principal at the school that 
you went to, did you have any friends?
    Dr. Gooden. No, sir. I had very few friends.
    Senator Tuberville. Nobody ever came home with you, did 
they?
    Dr. Gooden. No. Very few.
    Senator Tuberville. Hard to get somebody to sleep over with 
you. I always wondered that.
    Dr. Gooden. Right.
    Senator Tuberville. Good to have you here. Dr. Gooden, a 
couple of quick questions. Would increasing the guaranteed to 
FSA loan cap expand access to capital and credit in rural 
communities?
    Dr. Gooden. Senator, thank you so much for that question. 
Actually, we work with our colleagues across USDA and certainly 
in FSA as well, really focused on improving farmers, ranchers, 
the livability and the livelihood. If I am so honored to be 
confirmed I will certainly work with FSA and other parts of 
USDA to really address these issues in rural America. Currently 
that is outside of the purview of Rural Development, but 
certainly is a focus of rural livability.
    Senator Tuberville. I think it is something we need to 
address, especially in some of the States like I am from. I 
mean, I think it is pretty important.
    You and I talked about rural broadband, and considering the 
strong push for fiber we are seeing from this Administration. 
Can you speak to the importance of promoting tech neutrality 
amongst all broadband technologies, including fiber and coax?
    Dr. Gooden. Thank you, Senator. I really appreciate that 
question.
    Senator Tuberville. It is a lot cheaper.
    Dr. Gooden. What we are focused on certainly in Rural 
Development is the quality of the broadband and the standards. 
Right now over 100, that is what we are focused on. We are 
pretty agnostic related to the technologies. I personally, my 
family and my community members in Buckingham County, Virginia, 
we understand the need for high-speed internet and the impact 
that it makes in lives. Certainly as I shared with you, right 
through our family farm there was fiber laid along a natural 
gas pipeline only 200 yards from my house and we were not able 
to connect to that high-speed internet at all.
    We are agnostic related to the technologies, open to all 
technologies. Again, we are focused on the quality of broadband 
that actually is deployed in these rural areas.
    Senator Tuberville. We have got to do something pretty 
quick because this technology in farm equipment is getting more 
complex, more complex, GPS and things like that. You know, I 
know you will do a good job with that, but I think that is one 
of the most important things we can do for our farmers.
    Commissioner, as you know farmers rely on derivatives to 
hedge risk. I just did a huge sweep of the South and I was 
shocked how many people hedge their farms. It is real, real 
important.
    What are you doing at the CFTC to make derivative products 
more accessible to producers and particular small farmers?
    Ms. Mersinger. Thank you for that question, and certainly 
making sure that America's farmers and ranchers can use our 
markets to hedge their risk, and a lot of times this is an 
important tool that they need to access credit. Certainly 
ensuring that they have access to these markets is very 
important.
    I think one of the things we can be doing, that we 
hopefully, at some point, will be able to do, is use our Office 
of Customer Education and Outreach to better get in touch with 
those small farmers and ranchers and at least introduce them to 
the markets and how they can help.
    You mentioned access. Earlier when I was speaking to 
Senator Smith I mentioned that we are seeing smaller numbers of 
the futures commission merchants, and that is a critical piece 
of accessing futures markets. Certainly we need to look at 
whether there are policies impacting it, there are barriers to 
entry, and just make sure that those who want to access our 
markets can, and that they are serving the price discovery rule 
that they are meant to serve.
    Senator Tuberville. Are you seeing people reach out to you 
about education and what you are doing, farmers, and is there a 
huge need for maybe education in this area?
    Ms. Mersinger. Yes, there is, and we do try to leverage 
some of our relationships with the various farm groups. We do 
have some limitations on how we can spend funds in our Office 
of Consumer Education, and I think it would be very helpful, if 
the Committee decided to do reauthorization, if we were able to 
expand that ability to use that money to better reach farmers 
and ranchers.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you, and thanks for both of your 
service. Thank you.
    Ms. Mersinger. Thank you.
    Senator Tuberville. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Warnock?
    Senator Warnock. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and 
congratulations to both of you for your nominations. As of last 
year, 90 percent of the places in Georgia that are unconnected 
are in rural communities, and we have already heard a lot about 
that today. There is no secret that rural America, rural 
Georgia struggles with this issue of connectivity. As I have 
said time and time again, broadband is to the 21st century what 
electricity was in the 20th century, and I think if we think 
about it in those terms it will sharpen the urgency with which 
we address this issue.
    Folks in rural Georgia consistently tell me that they do 
not have adequate internet access, and they cannot take 
advantage of distance learning, of telehealth services. I have 
spent a lot of time with farmers, working with Senator Thune 
and others, to address the issue of precision agriculture. It 
is impressive to see what farmers are able to do with these new 
precision agricultural technologies. We are looking to 
standardize these technologies so that they can talk to one 
another.
    None of that means anything at all if people cannot get 
online. I am glad that the ReConnect Program has provided over 
$93.5 million to deploy broadband in rural areas of Georgia 
that lack sufficient access.
    Dr. Gooden, if confirmed, will you commit to working with 
me and my colleagues to prioritize an efficient rollout of 
these broadband development funds to ensure all Georgians have 
access to reliable internet connection? Help me to understand 
where that is in your suite of priorities, and how you will 
help us to get that done.
    Dr. Gooden. Thank you, Senator Warnock. High-speed internet 
is vitally important to rural America, and I like to say it is 
not an amenity; it is a necessity.
    Senator Warnock. Right.
    Dr. Gooden. We see that across the country. I fully commit 
to ensuring that we work with your staff and other Members of 
Congress to make sure that we roll out our ReConnect Program 
and we continue to work with other parts of the Federal 
Government, like the Department of Commerce, NTIA, FCC, to make 
sure that we do not duplicate efforts but we augment and 
support each other. I certainly commit to addressing broadband 
issues across rural America.
    Senator Warnock. Well, thank you for your commitment. It is 
critical, and we have got to remain focused on this issue. 
ReConnect, to be fair, is just one component of solving this 
big problem, but all of this new broadband infrastructure does 
not do a bit of good if people cannot access it, but also if 
people cannot afford it. That is why I was glad to see that the 
Biden administration requested that Congress provide additional 
funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program. We have got to 
keep those two things, those two priorities at the center of 
our minds, both accessibility and affordability. I hope we can 
get those things done.
    Dr. Gooden. Thank you, Senator. Also reliability. I would 
like to throw in reliability there as well. Affordable, 
certainly, and reliable.
    Senator Warnock. I certainly will agree with that.
    Georgia's needs are diverse. I have worked tirelessly to 
address the needs of all Georgians, including the unique 
challenges faced by rural and underserved communities. Some 
rural communities in my State like Echols County have little or 
no access to physical bank branches, making it difficult for 
them to manage their financial assets. Sometimes a banking app, 
as nice as that is to have, sometimes it does not cut it, 
particularly if you cannot get online.
    My next question is directed to Ms. Mersinger. Do you 
believe financial technology companies have a role in promoting 
financial inclusion in rural and underserved communities, and 
what is the work that we need to see done on that front?
    Ms. Mersinger. Thank you for that question, and coming from 
a small community my mother actually spent her career working 
at the Onida Bank. It was a Main Street bank, and it was 
critical to the farmers and ranchers in that community to have 
the capital that they needed to do their work and to supplement 
their livelihoods. I completely understand what you are saying 
about the importance of having access to bank branches.
    Certainly I think fintech can play a role. As you said, an 
app does not necessarily replace the physical bank on the 
street corner, but certainly if there are ways to reach more 
people and provide them regulated banking services, I think 
that is really important and something that should be promoted 
as long as there are adequate consumer protections and 
regulatory oversight.
    Senator Warnock. I think that is critically important, and 
we see that many of these communities are sometimes targeted, 
and they do not have access to the very kinds of services that 
you are talking about. I look forward to working with you, and 
I remain committed to ensuring that all Georgians have access 
to the services they need to build wealth and ensure their 
financial security, both through mobile banking services and 
physical branch locations.
    Thank you so very much. Congratulations.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you. Senator Braun.
    Senator Braun. Thank you, Madam Chair. I enjoyed our 
conversation yesterday evening, Dr. Gooden. I have got a 
question for you and then momentarily one for you, Mrs. 
Mersinger.
    You know, when it comes to rural broadband our State has 
done pretty well in terms of putting its own resources into it. 
Often when anything comes from the Federal Government we have 
received, in Indiana, through ReConnect, two fundings, one for 
$1 million and one for $2 million, and Illinois has received 
several, one of which would be for $20 million. I would like to 
know what the rhyme or reason is for how much a given State 
gets, and why, in the case of two neighbors there, there would 
be such a disparity between one that is literally either 10 or 
20 times the size of the two that we got in Indiana, which 
would have been back in 2020?
    Dr. Gooden. Thank you, Senator Braun. I appreciate that 
question. I look forward to learning more about that. I am not 
fully aware of that issue, but I certainly would work with you, 
your staff to better understand and then provide you a response 
related to how those applications are reviewed. Thank you for 
the question, and I will look forward to learning more about 
that.
    Senator Braun. If you do not mind, I think it would be good 
to go through probably how that has been dispensed across the 
country, because just in this one case that was brought to my 
attention by folks from Indiana. Indiana is a place that 
generally is going to be somewhat more self-reliant, and I 
would hope that you are not being penalized. If you are doing 
that, that should have no bearing in terms of how you might 
participate in a Federal program.
    Dr. Gooden. Thank you, Senator. I do know that these 
programs are highly competitive and often oversubscribed, and I 
know there are some very tough decisions that have to be made 
related to these programs. Again, I do commit to learning more 
about that.
    Senator Braun. Getting back to me on it will be fine. Thank 
you.
    Dr. Gooden. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Braun. Mrs. Mersinger, when it comes to the whole 
cryptocurrency issue, to me that is something that is so 
amorphous, we do not know where it is going to end up. It is 
certainly not a currency in the sense of having stability. I 
want to just zero in on it, though, in that it is emerging. It 
is new.
    Last week the CEO of Binance, the world's largest crypto 
exchange, pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering 
requirements. Earlier this month, the founder of FTX, another 
crypto exchange, was found guilty of seven counts of fraud. 
Last year the Committee spent considerable time debating new 
crypto regulations. It seems to me that our existing laws and 
regulations are bringing criminals to justice. I would like to 
hear your opinion on that. In an industry that is literally 
evolving daily, that has got a lot of peculiarities to it, and 
I think it is yet to be determined where it fits into the total 
scheme, do you think we need more regulation, or do you think 
there is accountability in place given the two instances I 
cited?
    Getting to the key question, even though we know there are 
issues with it, is there a possibility we could over-regulate 
it, especially when we have brought two to accountability 
already?
    Ms. Mersinger. Thank you for that question. I was worried I 
would not get a crypto question, so I am glad that we----
    Senator Braun. There you go.
    Ms. Mersinger [continuing]. I am glad we are having this 
conversation. I do have to give a lot of credit and accolades 
to our enforcement team. They were really the first movers on 
the Binance case. They came out with a very strong case against 
Binance, the founder and their chief compliance officer, and we 
definitely have seen justice served in that space.
    I think what that means is we are catching people who are 
committing fraud and who are doing bad things in these markets. 
Unfortunately, when you are only using your enforcement 
authority you are coming in after the fact. The money has been 
lost, consumers have been harmed, the bad behavior has 
occurred.
    While we are able to go after those individuals with the 
authorities we have, what we do not have is the ability to get 
ahead and be proactive and look at these markets and ensure 
that customers are protected. There is an immense amount of 
interest in these markets from U.S. citizens. We cannot ignore 
it. In working closely with our States we need to have a 
Federal framework to oversee the cash markets for crypto 
commodities.
    Senator Braun. Does that mean then you are going to use the 
current framework, try to enhance it, or just be kind of 
attentive to it?
    Ms. Mersinger. That is a great question, and it is 
something we have looked into. I do believe that we probably 
need legislative authority to do more in this space. I do not 
think that right now these exchanges could register under our 
current regime. Yes, I have seen a lot of great ideas out of 
this Committee and elsewhere throughout Congress, and I think 
we can get to a good place where we have Federal framework to 
properly regulate these markets.
    Senator Braun. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you. I am just going to jump in 
with one editorial comment because I do, Senator Braun, want to 
say that the enforcement being done at CFTC has been really 
excellent. It is important to note that there is no regime in 
place on the front end. What happened at FTX would have been 
completely illegal if we had passed the bill that Senator 
Boozman and I had introduced last year, in terms of 
transparency and so on. Hopefully we will have more opportunity 
in the coming year to really discuss that. Thank you.
    All right. Well, Senator Hoeven, you have jumped in just in 
time to bump Senator Hyde-Smith. All right, Senator Hyde-Smith. 
She has been very patient. Thank you. Senator Hyde-Smith.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Either way is fine. Thank you, Madam 
Chairman, and thank you for hosting this hearing. Thank you to 
the two of you. You know, I congratulated some folks earlier in 
the day, and I said, ``Thank you for your bravery,'' but thank 
you for your willingness. To have four children tagging along, 
and you both have beautiful families. Senator Ernst and I had a 
sidebar conversation. We both have one child each, and I said, 
``I do not know what I did before I got her, but I must have 
been a lazy American.'' I cannot imagine what you go through.
    I am going to start with Dr. Gooden. I certainly enjoyed 
our visit yesterday, and I know I threw a lot of stuff at you, 
and I think we had a thorough discussion. One of the things we 
spoke of yesterday that I am concerned about is health care. 
You know, throughout Mississippi, particularly our Delta, the 
epicenter of our agriculture industry, we are currently facing 
some very severe potential hospital closures. Working on a farm 
is dangerous. We are livestock producers ourselves, and whether 
it is equipment accidents or handling livestock, it is critical 
that we have access to rural health care. I have had to leave 
the Senate floor to fly home when my husband encountered a 
bull, and, you know, many family members we have literally had 
to airlift because that is what we do for a living.
    I am just worried about how producers and farm workers in 
Mississippi are going to get that urgent medical care if the 
rural areas in which they work do not have a hospital. Rural 
Americans face very unique health disparities and challenges 
compared to those in urban areas, but we grow the food in rural 
areas. It is hard to grow food in a subdivision.
    I have worked to establish the CDC Office of Rural Health 
Support, Rural Development's Delta Health Care Services Grant 
programs and provided resources for telecommunications programs 
to help rural Mississippi hospital administer that. When you 
have a patient, you know, you have a patient you have to get to 
somewhere. This Committee has spent a lot of time this year 
talking about using the farm bill to strengthen rural America 
by supporting farmers and ranchers, but I want to make sure we 
look at the health care situation because of the obvious reason 
that I have already Stated.
    If confirmed, what will you do to ensure that Rural 
Development's programs to support health care and hospitals are 
strong and effective, and how can Congress help the agency on 
those endeavors?
    Dr. Gooden. Thank you, Senator, and I certainly share your 
concern about health care in rural America. As a farmer myself 
I certainly understand the dangers of working on a farm. 
Actually, a longtime worker on our farm actually had a stroke 
on our farm, but he had a stroke. He worked for us for about 30 
years, and actually it took more than four hours for him to get 
to a medical facility because of the remoteness of the area but 
also because of weather. I really think that his condition 
would have turned out different if he had easier access to 
health care. Certainly that is near and dear to me. That is 
something that we understand.
    I am excited to say that through our Community Facilities 
Program most of that program, the portfolio is dedicated to 
rural health care, funding rural clinics in the areas, and 
personally again, when I was the State director in Virginia I 
worked with a rural hospital in Appalachia, out of Lee County, 
Virginia, to try to help find ways to make sure that that 
hospital stayed open as well.
    I am very familiar with the significant issue rural 
hospitals and health care is across the country, and certainly 
I will commit to ensuring that we utilize our programs to Rural 
Development, Community Facilities Programs, and other 
resources, working with partners to address health care issues 
in rural America.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you very much for that. I want to 
talk about rural water assistance. That is also very important 
to me, very important to my constituents, and I have worked to 
support Rural Development's Circuit Rider Program that provides 
essential services to train small communities on how to best 
operate and maintain their water systems. Safe water, as we 
well know, is so critical.
    I have also worked with Senator Cortez Masto to introduce 
the Rural Water System Disaster Preparedness Assistance Act to 
make sure rural water systems can resume operations as soon as 
possible after a natural disaster. We have a lot of those in 
Mississippi because we have a lot of hurricanes in Mississippi.
    These rural water programs administered by your agency are 
very important and helpful, but the application process also 
involves a lot of paperwork and a lot of red tape. As we talked 
about yesterday, the folks who are in the business of 
assistance and advisors to do that, that business is growing, 
the consultants, because it is so difficult. I want us to be 
able to provide that assistance, as The U.S. Federal 
Government. So when you come in and apply for these programs, 
we are the ones trained to help you do that.
    What opportunities do you foresee to strengthen and improve 
access to rural water programs, particularly through the 
administrative burdens?
    Dr. Gooden. Thank you, Senator. I am very proud of our 
rural water program, our WEP Program, and the people that run 
that program, but we certainly look for opportunities to, 
again, collaborate and partner with folks on the ground. 
Certainly we work with municipalities to deploy these programs, 
understanding that clean, safe water is essential to not only 
the health but also business creation and job creation as well.
    Certainly we are committed there. Certainly things that we 
can do is actually work with, again, our partners on the 
ground, but also make sure that Congress understands and make 
sure that we hear any concerns that you, your office have 
related to any of our programs in Rural Development and 
certainly around clean water.
    I think we certainly have the knowledge and expertise. We 
may need to augment the staffing in some of our field-based 
operations, the boots on the ground, and I think that is where 
we can focus a lot of our energy to get this job done related 
to rural water.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you. You both are so impressive, 
and I have more questions but I am out of time so I will submit 
those to the record. Thank you.
    Dr. Gooden. Thank you.
    Senator Boozman. Senator Hoeven.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Ranking Member Boozman. Thanks 
to both of you for being here. We appreciate it very much, and 
your service.
    Dr. Gooden, one of the big challenges we have is creating 
more competition for our livestock producers. I know you both 
are well aware of that. One of the things that your 
predecessor, Secretary Torres Small, worked on very diligently 
was helping us get more of these processing and water 
facilities going in our State and around the country. We need 
to do a lot more of that so I want to hear what your ideas are 
to really help create more competition that will serve our 
ranchers in great States like mine as well as South Dakota and 
really across the country. You know, what can we do? What are 
you committed to do to really help our cattlemen get better 
pricing, more competition, more transparency, more options to 
sell their great product?
    Dr. Gooden. Thank you, Senator. I really appreciate that 
question. As a cattleman myself I look for any opportunities to 
increase revenue, gate sales, anything that we can do to 
support our farmers, ranchers, foresters, and landowners in 
rural America. We certainly have programs. Certainly the Meat 
and Poultry Processing Program has really garnered a lot of 
interest. It is really making a significant impact, and it 
continues to be open right now to continue to receive 
consideration for these projects, knowing that the more that we 
can increase competition in the processing space that is better 
for the farmers and ranchers and producers as well.
    Certainly not only looking for revenue streams from meat 
processing but also trying to reduce costs, to augment the cost 
of fertilization. We have a fertilization program as well, 
looking at trying to make sure that that is sustainable, that 
farmers can rely on domestic production of fertilizer.
    Really looking at ways that we can reduce costs, certainly, 
for the farmers but also make it sustainable. Increasing income 
opportunities and revenue streams for rural farmers as well, 
whether it is through bio-based products, you know, 
consideration, but just looking at ways that we can create more 
and better markets for our rural farmers and our rural 
businesses as well.
    Senator Hoeven. Yes. You have a lot of cow-calf operations 
down there in central Virginia----
    Dr. Gooden. Yes, sir.
    Senator Hoeven [continuing]. and what we see is these 
operations startup but they have a heck of a time staying in 
business. You know, it is hard for them. What can you do to 
really help? It is one thing they startup but then we have got 
to keep them going and hopefully growing so that they are a 
stable market for our producers.
    Dr. Gooden. Certainly I am committed to, and have been 
working across USDA, breaking down any silos that may exist to 
really work with our counterparts in FSA and actually looking 
at how we can better serve and deliver programs to our rural 
communities, farmers and farmers. I certainly understand the 
significance of the issues of startups, and I am certainly 
committed to working with FSA to make sure that we are 
providing the support needed to our rural farmers as well.
    Senator Hoeven. Well, Rural Development, it is 
appropriately named, and it is really important that you find 
ways to help these folks really stay in business and build that 
market. I think you can have a huge impact, because timeliness 
is something people want. You know, the consumer wants it as 
well. I look forward to working with you on that. I want to get 
you out to our State. It is really not just about getting these 
operations going, but making sure that they can stay in 
business and grow and serve not just the cow-calf operator but 
the consumer.
    Dr. Gooden. Yes, sir.
    Senator Hoeven. Then I want to stay on this line with you, 
Commissioner Mersinger. What can the CFTC do to help, again, 
create more options for markets for our cattlemen?
    Ms. Mersinger. Thank you for that question, Senator, and 
certainly our cattle contracts, they perform an important 
function in the cattle ecosystem overall by providing adequate 
price discovery and hedging opportunities. For the CFTC it is 
important to us to make sure that those markets are operating 
as they should, that they reflect the market fundamentals on 
the ground, so that these producers can adequately hedge their 
risk. If they are not doing that then we need to take a look at 
why that is happening. If there need to be changes to the 
contract term that is something the exchange can look at. If it 
is a delivery point issue, if there are other concerns 
underlying the market, those are things that we can look into, 
because these markets need to work.
    Senator Hoeven. Yes. You come from a State that has a large 
livestock population, and again, need to find ways to help our 
cattlemen with markets--more competitive pricing, more 
transparency, more opportunities.
    Ms. Mersinger. Absolutely.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. [Presiding.] Thank you very much.
    At this point we will conclude the hearing and thank both 
of you very much for your testimony. Because we want very much 
to move your nominations as soon as we can, the record will be 
open until tomorrow at 5 p.m. for members to submit additional 
questions or statements. Senator Boozman and I are going to be 
working closely together, and we are hopeful that we can report 
nominations out of Committee next week.
    The meeting is adjourned.

    [Whereupon, at 11:41 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
