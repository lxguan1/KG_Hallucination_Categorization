                   GO-TO-ZERO: JOE BIDEN'S WITHDRAWAL



             ORDER AND THE TALIBAN TAKEOVER OF AFGHANISTAN

                              ----------                              


                       Tuesday, November 14, 2023

                  House of Representatives,
      Subcommittee on Oversight and Accountability,
                              Committee on Foreign Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.

    The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2 p.m., in room 
210, House Visitor Center, Hon. Brian Mast (chairman of the 
subcommittee) presiding.
    Mr. Mast. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Accountability 
will come to order. The purpose of this hearing is to analyze 
the impact of President Biden's April 14, 2021, go-to-zero U.S. 
military withdrawal order in Afghanistan and the effect that 
this had on the Afghan military and the Air Force in the middle 
of the Afghan fighting season. I will now recognize myself for 
an opening statement.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BRIAN MAST

    As mentioned, we are going to examine the go-to-zero order. 
Now, in the past 27 months, the disastrous images of embassy 
personnel being air lifted off the roof in Kabul, the images of 
desperate parents throwing their babies over walls of HKIA, the 
images of Afghans clinging to the wings of transport planes, 
they have been played on loops across media across the world.
    The purpose of today's hearing is two-fold. It is not to 
just rehash those horrifying images. It is to pinpoint, to 
pinpoint the day where it all went wrong, where you could say 
there is a day before and a day after, the day that President 
Joe Biden announced the go-to-zero order, and it is not just to 
provide an after-action report. It is to force President Biden 
to do something that it seems he hasn't been willing to do 
since the day he was sworn in to office, and that is to live in 
reality. The reality of the circumstances that are going on 
around you.
    President Biden loves to say that the collapse of Kabul in 
August 2021 was inevitable, but anybody who was paying an ounce 
of attention can tell you that it wasn't inevitable. The 
collapse of Kabul wasn't something that we were headed toward 
in 2002. It wasn't something that we were headed toward in 2010 
when I was airlifted off the battlefield of Kandahar. It wasn't 
something that we were headed toward in 2016 when Donald J. 
Trump was elected. It wasn't something that we were headed 
toward on February 29, 2020, when the Doha Agreement was 
signed. It wasn't something that we were headed toward on 
January 20, 2021, when Joe Biden took office.
    It became inevitable on April 14, 2021, when President 
Biden publicly announced his plans for an unconditional 
withdraw by September 11, 2021. President Biden loves to place 
the blame on the Doha Agreement and President Trump's 
negotiations, but in doing so I believe that he is ignoring 
reality.
    Let's be clear: the Doha Agreement told President Biden 
what he had to do, but President Biden did not have to publicly 
announce any plans for a specific withdraw date, didn't have to 
be a hard and fast date that he announce to the world, a self-
imposed deadline.
    President Biden did not have to redirect resources from 
fighting terrorists in all capacities to drawing down all 
operations at the height of the fighting season as opposed to 
the winter months. President Biden did not have to knock the 
knees from the Afghan military by cutting and gutting their air 
support, withdrawing key contractors and pulling logistic 
capabilities. President Biden did not have to abandon Bagram 
Air Base in the middle of the night without so much as a dear 
John letter to our Afghan partners. President Biden did not 
have to ignore the fact that the Taliban was in violation of 
every single condition that was set forward by the Doha 
Agreement. All of those decisions were made by a commander in 
chief who was determined to, in my opinion, avoid reality and 
whose only north star was a political future, a political star.
    Our witnesses today will be able to speak to the reality 
that President Biden so obviously avoided. Mr. Roggio saw the 
writing on the wall as he tracked the Taliban's takeover of 
Afghanistan in real-time. General Sami Sadat was forced to live 
with the consequences of Biden's delusion as his troops were 
left demoralized and without resources needed to defend their 
nation, a nation that myself and my colleague both spent a good 
amount of time in.
    I also want to thank Dr. Dipali Mukhopadhyay--I have worked 
on saying that a couple times and I still mess it up, and I 
apologize; I am going to have to say it a few more times--for 
being here today to lend your expertise and your opinion and to 
recognize the members of the Afghan Army's national female 
tactical platoon, who are in attendance today.
    In addition, I want to recognize the fact that Ms. Christy 
Shamblin, mother-in-law of Sergeant Nicole Gee, is here today. 
It is always nice to see you and I appreciate you continually 
paying attention to this issue, taking of your time to 
continually do so, one of the 13 killed at the Abbey Gate.
    Here is why all of this matters--let me wrap this up--the 
refusal to operate in reality that gave more than 13 families 
the title of Gold Star on August 26, 2021, it is the same 
delusion that has underestimated terrorists and led to 48 
attacks against our U.S. military posts in the past month: not 
living in reality of what is taking place. The same delusion 
that allowed him to say that there is a safe and secure border 
or that inflation is just a brief transient inflation. It is 
not a recognition of reality in foreign and domestic.
    Every minute that President Biden ignores the reality is 
another minute that our troops across the globe are put at 
unnecessary risk and another minute that the network of 
terrorists from Taliban to Hamas are able to get closer to 
their goals of destroying the United States of America.
    I now recognize my friend, ranking member, gentleman from 
Colorado, Mr. Crow, for any statement at any length that you 
may have.

         OPENING STATEMENT OF RANKING MEMBER JASON CROW

    Mr. Crow. Thank you, Chairman Mast, for calling this really 
important hearing.
    I would like to begin by recognizing Ms. Shamblin for being 
here and for the sacrifice that your family has made for our 
country on behalf of all of us, a sacrifice of which we owe a 
great debt that our Nation will never be able to repay, but we 
will certainly try to do that sacrifice credit here and moving 
forward.
    I also want to recognize the members of the Afghan 
military, my Afghan brothers and sisters who fought this war 
with great courage, with great fortitude, and both of us leave 
pieces of our heart in Afghanistan and with you and your 
families. Thank you for being here today as well.
    The purpose here those is to have a debate about a very 
challenging period in our Nation's history. The chairman talked 
about pinpointing the day it all went wrong. Our service 
members and the American people do deserve that. They deserve 
an honest assessment of that. They deserve honesty and they 
deserve candor. I, for my part, have been very clear about my 
criticisms of the withdrawal, and I continue to be clear about 
that. But telling the story of Afghanistan, our Nation's 
longest war, 20 years, hundreds of billions of dollars, 
thousands of lives, just American lives, but also tens of 
thousands or more Afghan lives, requires a broader look.
    It would be doing a great discredit and disservice to talk 
about this simply as the story of August 2021, because the day 
it all went wrong includes many days over many, many years. So 
I would like to outline a chronology, a timeline, that is 
extremely important here today.
    As you can see, starting on February 29 of 2020, there were 
13,000 American service members in Afghanistan at the time that 
former President Trump signed the Doha Accord. By May 19 of 
2020, there were 8,600 service members in Afghanistan. By 
September 3 of 2020, Afghanistan was compelled to release 400 
Taliban prisoners required under the agreement. Then, by 
November 17 of 2020, we were down to 2,500 forces, or we 
announced a withdrawal of 2,500 forces by January 2021, before 
President Trump took--or President Biden took office.
    Between December 1 and December 31 of 2020 there were 185 
pro-government forces killed, over 3,000 security forces 
killed, and over 1,400 civilians killed by the Taliban during 
that period, far from compliance with the Doha Agreement. Then, 
by January 15, before President Biden took office, we had 
completed the withdrawal down to 2,500 forces. So the cement 
was hardening on the events of August 2021 way before it 
occurred.
    Highlighting a few key events, again, it was February 29 of 
2020, when Donald Trump signed the Doha Accord with the 
Taliban. Then you go to September 12 of 2020. The Afghan 
Taliban talks finally start, 7 months behind schedule. Then 
going to October 7 of 2020, Donald Trump started tweeting and 
he said specifically that American troops would be home by 
Christmas. At the same time they were trying to compel the 
Taliban to adhere to the deal and maintain security the 
President of the United States is tweeting out that we are 
going to do an immediate withdrawal of troops, undermining 
everything that we had done way before 2021. So by January 15 
of 2021, the Afghan first vice president says that Trump made 
too many concessions to the Taliban and that violence will only 
increase.
    Yes, were there mistakes and missteps in August 2021? 
Undoubtedly there were.we will do after-action reviews, we will 
have discussions to make sure that we can never repeat those 
mistakes again because we deserve to do better. Those who made 
the sacrifice that month deserve us to do better.
    But make no mistake, this is not the story of August 2021, 
and it would be doing a great disservice to the American people 
and all who made tremendous sacrifices if we did not recognize 
the many missteps that were made over four Presidential 
administrations, Republican and Democrat, that were made over 
10 Congresses, Republican and Democrat. Too many people 
sacrificed too much to look at this as a narrow story.
    President Biden, when he took office in January 2021, with 
the lowest number of troops that we had in decades, faced a 
simple choice: Do we abide by the Doha Agreement that was 
negotiated under the prior administration or do we go back to 
war with the Taliban, in which case we would have to surge a 
tremendous number of forces to protect the Americans who were 
still there and we would fighting to this day? That was the 
choice.
    Now you can disagree one way or the other on what that 
choice should have been, but that was the choice he was facing. 
There was no status quo. That was the terrible choice and he 
made the decision to withdraw and pull out and to comply with 
the agreement.
    With that history in mind I look forward to hearing from 
the witnesses and having a discussion that befits the sacrifice 
of so many folks over the last 20 years. I yield back.
    Mr. Mast. Thank you, Ranking Member Crow.
    I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Iowa, Mr. 
Nunn, be allowed to sit on the dais and participate at today's 
hearing. Without objection, so ordered.
    Other members of the committee are reminded that opening 
statements may be submitted for the record.
    We are pleased to have distinguished witnesses before us 
today on this important topic. To start, again we have General 
Sami Sadat, who was final commanding general of the Afghan 
National Army's Special Operations Corps and commanded the 
Afghan Army's 215th Maiwand Corps into August 2021. No one is 
better positioned to speak to the immediate and devastating 
impact of President Biden's go-to-zero order on the Afghan 
military's fight against the Taliban.
    Next we have Mr. Bill Roggio, who is senior fellow at the 
Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a long-time editor of 
FDD's Long War Journal, where he has provided critical insight 
and analysis into the Global War on Terror and the war in 
Afghanistan.
    Finally, again we have Dr. Mukhopadhyay, who is associate 
professor of global policy at University of Minnesota. She 
joined the university with tenure in 2020. She was previously a 
member of the junior faculty at Columbia University.
    Thank you all for being here today. Your full statements 
will be made a part of the record, and I will ask that you keep 
your spoken remarks to 5 minutes in order to allow time for 
member questions.
    I now recognize you, General Sadat, for an opening 
statement.

    STATEMENT OF SAMI SADAT, LIEUTENANT GENERAL (RETIRED), 
CHAIRMAN, AFGHANISTAN UNITED FRONT, FORMER COMMANDING GENERAL, 
            AFGHAN NATIONAL SPECIAL OPERATIONS CORPS

    General Sadat. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Congressman 
Crow, and members of the committee and--good afternoon. Thank 
you for inviting us for this hearing today.
    Before answering questions I want to take a few minutes to 
make some remarks, and my remarks are divided in three parts in 
what is happening in Afghanistan under the Taliban now; No. 2, 
why we got here; and No. 3, what are the possible solutions 
that I can recommend to the committee.
    For the past 20 years the American people helped support 
and protect the people of Afghanistan, our people. We built a 
new society with your support where for first time girls were 
educated across the country and women were treated with 
equality. A new generation grew up with the hope that this time 
it would be different and Afghanistan would take its rightful 
place among the family of free democratic nations.
    Unfortunately it was not to last. That hope was cruelly 
extinguished, but we remember how in the hard times when 
President Biden and President Ghani turned their tail and run 
away it was you Members of Congress who supported the efforts 
of your brave service members, men and women, who saved 
thousands of Afghan lives in the face of certain death as our 
country collapsed. On behalf of the people of Afghanistan I 
thank you. We will remember this for the rest of our days.
    Twenty years after 9/11 Afghanistan fell back into the 
hands of the terrorists who were the very reason why 9/11 has 
happened. The consequences for the region and the world are 
grave. As we can see in the recent unfortunate events in the 
Middle East the rise of Taliban has given new life to the 
groups like Hamas.
    Today some 16,000 Al Qaeda terrorists are training in our 
country. Their leaders move freely between Afghanistan and Iran 
along a safe terror corridor. The former American base close to 
Kandahar Airport is now full of foreign fighters terrorist as 
suicide bombers. They are so imbedded into the Taliban system 
that the Taliban Ministry of Defense is using Al Qaeda manual 
for its training, and it's not just Al Qaeda. In our country 
today we have the TTP from Pakistani Taliban, we have Islamic 
Movement of Uzbekistan, we have Ansarullah of Tajikistan, and 
et cetera and et cetera.
    With the Taliban in power terrorism has now time, space, 
and inspiration that were denied by the U.S. military and the 
Afghan military. The Taliban have opened some 2,000 Jihadi 
madrasas housing 800,000 boys aged between 12 to 15. The 
purpose is to train for global jihad.
    Why is this important? The Taliban are Sunni Muslims who 
follow a distorted interpretation of the Holy Koran, tailored 
to serve their authority. They divide the world into two zones. 
The first zone, Dar al-Islam, the Land if Islam, or the Land of 
the Peace. The second is Dar al-Harb, as known as Dar Al-Kufr 
as well, the Land of War or the Land of the Infidels. In their 
interpretation the only place governed by Islam is Afghanistan. 
The rest of the world is a place to wage war. To expand their 
distorted version of Islam they started this campaign from our 
neighbor in Pakistan who nurtured them for so many years with 
no mercy on children, women, and non-combatants.
    The next place to wage war is the Middle East. They believe 
no Arab country is governed under pure Islam, hence they want 
to help Al-Qaeda topple Arab governments. For them to wage war, 
killing men and women, seizing property and toppling businesses 
is an act of jihad to please God and die for the cause that 
will be rewarded in the afterlife, and they have allied with 
Iran opening a corridor of terror from Afghanistan to Iraq, 
Syria, and the rest of the Middle East with the help of the 
Iranian IRGC.
    China, also our neighbor, is paying the Taliban large sums 
of money for access to Afghan mines and routes for Iranian oil 
via Afghanistan blocking any access of the United States and 
allies in that region.
    How did we get here? In 2020 and 2021, as predicted, the 
Taliban ignored their side of the Doha deal. They didn't cut 
their links with Al-Qaeda and continue to conduct large-scale 
attacks on Afghan cities. To give you an example of their 
brutal attacks, in the 11 months of 2020 after the deal the 
Taliban conducted 4,000--48,600 attacks including car bombs, 
assassinations, and large-scale assaults on Afghan cities.
    I am running out of my time, Mr. Chairman. I will answer 
the rest of them in the Q&A. If you want to give me some time, 
I'll continue for another minute.
    Mr. Mast. I can give you another minute. Go ahead.
    General Sadat. Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Mast. By all means.
    General Sadat. In the turn we were told to halt all 
military operations to give peace a chance. Our ammunition 
supply was halted and 17,000 contractors who maintained our 
aircraft and software system had the orders to leave 
Afghanistan. Further, the Afghan government was told to release 
7,000 Taliban prisoners including men who killed American and 
NATO troops, drug dealers and baby killers.
    We still stood our ground with whatever we could and kept 
fighting but Secretary of State Mr. Antony Blinken wrote a 
letter to President Ghani in which it was made public asking 
the president to resign and that allow a Taliban-led--employed 
the--to allow the Taliban-led government to come to power. This 
made it very clear to everybody in Afghanistan and in our 
region that the Afghan government no longer has the support and 
trust of the United States, hence giving a chance for Iran and 
Pakistan to come up with everything they have in support of the 
Taliban and lead into the collapse of our country.
    But despite the failures on the part of the Taliban to 
stick to the terms of the deal, President Biden still went 
ahead with the withdrawal leading to the chaos of collapse of 
our country. It was a betrayal not only of the Afghan hopes, 
but of the sacrifice of over 200,000 Afghan troops and 6,000 
Americans who died for our freedom, and some of them carry 
injuries, including yourself, Mr. Chairman, until this day.
    I know what loss means. Some of those brave warriors fell 
or were wounded when on an operation with me. To this day I 
remember every moment and feel the pain in my bones.I say to 
you now that I would be betraying the sacrifice if I didn't 
attempt to recover our land where Afghans and Americans bled 
for freedom. It would be an insult to their sacrifice to allow 
the widows and children to be ruled by the brute dehumanized 
Taliban.
    Mr. Chairman, I know we cannot go back in the past to 
change what has happened, but we can change the future and what 
is to come to us. We're not going to sit idle and let it 
happen. We're organizing now to recover our country, united 
under one flag with equal rights for women, inclusive of all 
minorities, and governed under a constitution chosen by our 
people. We have set up a political movement, Afghan United 
Front, to show our resolve and wanting a legitimate government 
in Afghanistan.
    We're not asking American boots in the ground alongside us. 
We're asking for your moral and political support. In our 
history, like other nations, we have seen tough times and 
invasions, but we always came back together and saved our 
country. We will fight for freedom and to free our country 
again making the Taliban rule a brief interruption in our 
history. We are ready for the great sacrifice. We will once 
again be one free nation under God. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF BILL ROGGIO, SENIOR FELLOW AND EDITOR OF THE LONG 
      WAR JOURNAL, FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE AND DEMOCRACIES

    Mr. Roggio. Chairman Mast, Ranking Member Crow, and other 
members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to 
testify and thank you, General Sadat and our members of the 
panel here, for taking the time today.
    There are many reasons that our mission in Afghanistan was 
troubled. There can be no denying that one decision, President 
Biden's April 14, 2021, order to withdraw from Afghanistan is 
directly responsible for the collapse of the Afghan government 
and its security forces. And that was what we have been brought 
here today to discuss.
    Certainly prior administrations contributed to the poor 
State of Afghanistan. The Afghan government military created by 
President Bush was ill-suited to combat and insurgency. 
President Obama's strategy was muddled. Its surge was under-
resourced and executed on an unrealistic timeline and the 
administration opened negotiations with the Taliban. And 
President Trump's deal with the Taliban known as the Doha 
Agreement was an absolute disaster. But this is extremely 
important: Despite the mistakes of previous administrations, on 
April 13, 2021, the government of Afghanistan was still 
standing and the Afghan military and police were still fighting 
the Taliban.
    Despite statements from the Biden Administration that it 
was cornered to execute the terms of the Doha Agreement, the 
administration was not obligated to do so. The Taliban was not 
living up to the terms of the deal as it continued to shelter 
and support Al-Qaeda and other groups. The Biden Administration 
knew this and yet it followed through on the Doha Agreement 
anyway. The fact is that President Biden was determined to 
leave Afghanistan; the Doha Agreement was a convenient excuse 
to do so.
    President Biden's order to withdraw had an immediate and 
devastating effect on the Afghan government and military. Once 
the order was given U.S. Forces were no longer supporting their 
Afghan partners. Instead, the immediate focus on packing up and 
leaving. We all remember the U.S. military turning off power at 
Bagram Air Base and leaving in the middle of the night without 
informing our Afghan partners.
    For another powerful example of this I strongly suggest 
watching Retrograde which documents the impact of the 
withdrawal on General Sadat's command. You will see that U.S 
Special Forces which supported General Sadat's corps 
immediately ceased operations. Despite difficulties in the 
south, this team of special forces was crucial in supporting 
the Afghan military operations and holding the Taliban at bay. 
Without U.S. support the Afghan military couldn't sustain its 
operations.
    We built an Afghan military that was dependent on Western 
contractors for maintenance and logistics. Without this support 
Afghan air assets, which were operating at a high tempo due to 
the Taliban onslaught, were quickly degraded.
    There are other factors which I've highlighted in my 
written testimony that I do hope we discuss today. General 
Sadat can no doubt speak authoritatively from his experience on 
the impact of President Biden's withdrawal order and it had on 
his soldiers and their morale.
    One thing is clear: The outcome, the Taliban takeover of 
Afghanistan was predictable. U.S. Government military and 
intelligence officials said that the Afghan government wouldn't 
be under threat for 2 years after the U.S. withdrawal. After 
the withdrawal was announced I predicted that the Afghan 
government wouldn't make it by the end of the summer. Kabul 
fell on August 15. Panjshir, the last holdout province, 
collapsed on September 7. Taliban didn't take control of 
Afghanistan in 11 days. This was a process that began the day 
that the withdrawal was announced and it was set up by years of 
failure.
    How did multi-billion dollar government organizations get 
it so wrong? These are questions that you must ask. The 
mistakes of past administrations were either correctable or 
could have been mitigated over time. The order to withdraw was 
final and once executed irreversible. However, if the Biden 
Administration was hell-bent on leaving, it could have executed 
a phased withdrawal that could have given the Afghan military a 
fighting chance.
    Why wasn't a responsible withdrawal from Afghanistan 
planned and executed? The implications of the withdrawal 
fiasco, both the decision to leave and the abandonment of our 
ally of 20 years, and the physical implementation of the 
withdrawal have lasting effects. We left an ally which 
sacrificed hundreds of thousands of its security personnel and 
an untold number of civilians battling the Taliban alone to the 
predations of a terror group that sponsored Al-Qaeda, both 
before and after 9/11.
    Al-Qaeda remains ensconced in Afghanistan and today is 
operating at least six training camps as well as safe houses 
and a media operations center. Several Al-Qaeda leaders serve 
in the Taliban's government. Sirajuddin Haqqani, one of the two 
deputy emirs of the Taliban and its minister of interior, he is 
a specially designated global terrorists for his ties to Al-
Qaeda. So are an untold number of his deputies listed as 
specially designated global terrorists.
    The Haqqani Network, which Sirajuddin Haqqani runs, is 
listed as a foreign terrorist organization. Sirajuddin 
Haqqani's interior ministry issues national ID cards and 
passports to Al-Qaeda leaders, operatives, and their families. 
Let that one sink in.
    Beyond Afghanistan the ramifications of the precipitous 
withdrawal are still being felt today. Jihadists across the 
globe have been emboldened by our defeat. Our allies question 
our commitments. Our adversaries and enemies do so as well. 
President Biden's order to leave Afghanistan has gravely impact 
U.S. national security. We must accept these facts if we wish 
to avoid these mistakes in the future. Thank you very much.

    Mr. Mast. Thank you, Mr. Roggio.
    I now recognize Dr. Mukhopadhyay for her opening statement.

    STATEMENT OF DIPALI MUKHOPADHYAY, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, 
                    UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA

    Ms. Mukhopadhyay. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and for 
perfectly pronouncing my name. I appreciate that.
    Thank you to you, thank you to members of the committee.
    Having spent my adult life as a scholar of Afghanistan it 
is a privilege to be with you. I first traveled there in 2004 
and made 11 extended trips thereafter, the last of which took 
place in the summer of 2021.
    I start by stating a fact on which I presume we can all 
agree: America's longest war was not lost in 20 days or 20 
months, but rather over 20 years. Four presidents made 
decisions that brought us here and each one's policies 
constrained those who followed. Ultimately and in many ways the 
logic, design, and implementation of the war doomed the Afghan 
republic. This contention does not suggest American malice, nor 
does it absolve Afghan guilt. But we must be clear, the United 
States and its allies went to war in the fall of 2001 because 
Al-Qaeda attacked our homeland.
    The subsequent promotion of women's rights, democracy, and 
development mattered to the degree they advanced the war on 
terror. A friendly government in Kabul, not a sovereign Afghan 
State, was the goal. This truth helps us understand the back-
to-the-future moment in which we and the Afghan people find 
ourselves with the Taliban once again at the helm.
    A number of early choices taken by the United States and 
its allies crippled the new Afghan government before it even 
got started. The Taliban regime fell swiftly and its successor 
owed its existence to the West. In exchange it would not 
control many of the fundamental decisions about power and 
politics on the ground. The Americans prevented President 
Karzai from exploring any genuine possibility of peace with 
those Talibs who sought surrender, a choice that would haunt 
the U.S. Government years later when it aimed to negotiate with 
those same enemies on vastly worse terms.
    The United States emboldened Pakistan as a key partner in 
the war even as the Pakistani security establishment gave 
sanctuary to those who killed American and Afghan forces for 
years to come. The coalition empowered anti-Taliban commanders 
as its core ground force early on and later as counterinsurgent 
militia forces. Even as some of those strong me became valuable 
governing partners others leveraged ongoing American support to 
their own ends, often at the expense of new civil and military 
institutions.
    The United States invested substantial aid in those 
institutions, but in erratic, incoherent, and unsustainable 
terms. The risks of such built-in dependencies were especially 
evident in the Afghan security sector.
    The triumph of foreign designs over Afghan's self-
determination was also exemplified in the international 
approach to elections. Foreign powers set an overly ambitious 
tempo and then selectively addressed fraud in terms that 
steadily undermined public trust and risked turning each 
electoral standoff into a civil war. By the time the 2019 
election arrived in Afghanistan the Trump Administration made 
clear that the time for our involvement there was over. A quick 
deal with the Taliban was a priority even if that meant 
sacrificing the country's future as a democracy.
    The ultimate precarity of Afghan's sovereignty would be 
most vividly revealed in 2020 when the Trump Administration 
signed the Doha Agreement with the Taliban. A boon to the 
Taliban, this deal undercut any remaining leverage the Afghan 
government might have had in subsequent negotiations to sue for 
peace without entirely sacrificing republican values.
    The Trump Administration then unilaterally dropped troop 
levels to 4,500, and just days before President Biden's 
inauguration to 2,500. Meanwhile, the Afghan government was 
forced to release thousands of Taliban prisoners, a provision 
in a deal to which it had not been a party.
    I was in Kabul in March 2020 and the sense of collective 
despair was palpable. Deeply disillusioned with their own 
leaders, Afghans were also resentful that their experiment with 
free politics mattered little to the Americans as we beat a 
path to the exits.
    My last visit to Kabul in the summer of 2021 is one I will 
never forget. Afghan leaders were both disbelieving about and 
therefore unprepared for the impending American departure, and 
yet also so crippled by its possibility that dysfunction had 
arrested the entire State. More striking however was the 
courage of my many long-time interlocutors in civil society who 
understood that all they built was now in jeopardy. They vowed 
not to give up though nearly all were eventually forced to 
leave in the face of near-certain persecution of death.
    The progress they secured gives me great optimism for 
Afghan's long-term future, but their sacrifices as well as 
those of our own demand our honest and deep reflection. We may 
not again engage in State building in the service of countering 
terrorism, but all of our interventions disrupt the politics 
and lives of others profoundly. We must learn from the Afghan 
war both the productive possibilities and acute limits of 
American power and try then to wield it with greater humility 
and care. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Mukhopadhyay follows:]

    Mr. Mast. Thank you, doctor.
    Thank you all for your comments.
    I am sorry I cannot agree with what you said. I will just 
start by saying I do define a win as the outcomes being better 
than what I expected and a loss being the outcomes being worse 
than what I expected. So I can't agree with you, but we will 
have time to discuss this and debate this as we--everybody 
will.
    I will now recognize my colleague, Ranking Member Crow, for 
5 minutes.
    Mr. Crow. Thank you, chairman. I would like to talk about 
the chronology leading up to the drawdown that I touched on in 
my opening remarks. I served in Afghanistan multiple times. I 
served in Iraq. I have been in combat environments. And we know 
that the morale of forces is essential to will--the will to 
fight is the most powerful thing, more powerful than any weapon 
system, any strategy, any tactic, the will to fight. And morale 
is essential to that.
    So at a moment where we are trying to enhance morale, where 
we are trying to embolden our partners, there were a series of 
just deeply troubling statements and comments coming out of the 
Former President's White House and from the Former President 
himself.
    I just would like to start with you, General Sadat, on a 
few of these. Here you have President Trump tweeting out on 
October 7 of 2020, we should have the small remaining number of 
our brave men and women serving in Afghanistan home by 
Christmas. Do you remember when that tweet went out?
    General Sadat. I don't, but I was aware that he was trying 
to draw down troops to a minimum level.
    Mr. Crow. What was the impact of this statement and your 
awareness and your force's awareness when these statements were 
being made?
    General Sadat. Of course statements made in Washington had 
a real impact, especially on us in the battleground. And these 
remarks have had its impact, but we continued to communicate 
with U.S. military and there was a--we were told there was a 
backup plan, that is things go south, the U.S. military will 
get involved. And they were actually gearing up and preparing 
for that because both us and the U.S. military, like you served 
there, we knew that this deal would not stand and we will get 
back on it.
    Mr. Crow. Did you ever see this backup plan or get 
specifics of it?
    General Sadat. I was a part of a trip in--I believe it was 
in February 2021 in Garmsir District where General Miller and 
myself visited a Navy SEALs camp in Garmsir and there--I saw 
that there was a plan, but the SEALs told us that if the orders 
were given when the deal goes off completely, they can destroy 
the Taliban in southern Afghanistan in 9 days. So for me that 
sounded like a quite reassuring backup plan.
    Mr. Crow. General, on November 11, 2020, the Former 
President wrote a memo and in the memo he said I hereby direct 
you to withdraw all U.S. military forces from the Federal 
Republic of Somalia no later than 31 December 2020 and from the 
Islamic Republic of Afghanistan no later than 15 January 2021. 
Were you familiar with that memo when it was signed, because it 
went public?
    General Sadat. No, sir, I don't recall. And I apologize for 
not recalling all of this. I was a combat soldier and I was 
always busy fighting. But these things had its impact for sure.
    Mr. Crow. Can you comment on the morale of your forces in 
2020?
    General Sadat. The morale of the forces went very bad when 
the Doha deal has happened. It was so dramatic. Not only our 
forces politically. Also giving the region the sense that the 
United States is leaving, a deterrence posture was lost. 
Politically we could never recover, Congressman Crow, from what 
happened in Doha. We were seen as a government that is not 
respect by its own allies.
    Mr. Crow. Mr. Roggio, I gather we disagree about the impact 
of the withdrawal from your opening statements, but I do want 
to just try to flesh out what I believe is a fact, and that is 
if we had not abided by the timeline--and I know we actually 
extended the timeline of the withdrawal of the Doha Agreement, 
but if we had not abided by the extended timeline of the 
withdrawal, it was pretty clear from the evidence we have 
gathered in transcribed interviews and prior hearings that the 
Taliban would have resumed offensive operations against the 
United States military in earnest. And at that point we had 
2,500 troops, the lowest amount we had had in almost 20--
actually over 20 years. How many troops would the United States 
had to have surged into Afghanistan if we had not abided by the 
withdrawal timeline?
    Mr. Roggio. I can't speak to the number. I think one of my 
problems with our policy in Afghanistan has always been a 
discussion of the number of troops and not the quality of 
troops that we put in there. We could have put 100,000 cooks in 
Afghanistan and it may not have made a difference, but if we'd 
have put in 5,000 combat forces, probably would have made a 
significant difference.
    Sir, you referenced Somalia. President Biden put U.S. 
troops back into Somalia after President Trump withdrew them. 
Why did he do so? Because he feared the collapse of the Somali 
government. Why was Somalia and the collapse of the Somali 
government more important than the collapse of our 20-year 
project in Afghanistan?
    Mr. Crow. Well, Mr. Roggio, on the issue of troops I agree 
that composition of a unit is important, but 5,000 combat 
troops without support, without logistics obviously does not 
matter. So would you agree though that 2,500 troops on the 
ground would not have been sufficient, that we would have had 
to increased our footprint in Afghanistan?
    Mr. Roggio. I do agree that we would have had to have 
increased our footprint. What that number is I can't tell you, 
but the--again the Afghan forces were fighting and Afghanistan 
did not collapse on August 13. So the question was, was 
Afghanistan important enough to the Biden Administration to 
maintain a commitment in--a U.S. commitment in Afghanistan? If 
the answer was yes, then he would have had to have put a number 
of troops back in. And if the answer was no, then he--and as he 
believed, he ordered a withdrawal. But the withdrawal, as I 
stated in my verbal testimony, was never conditioned to allow 
the Afghan government and military to succeed. They were not 
given a chance.
    So to answer your question, yes, we would have needed more 
combat troops in Afghanistan, but the--how the withdrawal was 
executed was entirely predictable, and we all witnessed the 
results of that.
    Mr. Crow. Thank you for that. I yield back.
    Mr. Mast. Thank you, ranking member.
    I now recognize Mr. Mills for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Mills. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Thank you to the panel for everyone coming here and for 
your time in service. It is greatly appreciated.
    I want to comment on a few things because every time that 
we try to get to the bottom of the final decisionmaking, which 
is always at the behest of the commander in chief, somehow we 
find ourselves spending more time talking about Trump all over 
again. And I understand my left's infatuation in the Trump 
deranged syndrome, which overwhelms them, and I do hope that 
through NIH or others they can seek help.
    The whole point is that this was a conditions-based 
agreement. It was very clear from the beginning that if the 
conditions were not met, and as you said, General Sadat, that 
there was a plan B, an alternative mechanism. The other thing 
that our colleagues continue to fail to acknowledge is that 
President Trump toward the end of his presidency had actually 
reversed his decision at the advisory of the generals and was 
going to maintain troops there to continue its support. We fail 
to always mention that piece of things.
    It is funny to me that Biden--and, Mr. Roggio, you said it 
so perfectly just now; I couldn't have said it better--he was 
so willing to do what was necessary to make sure that the fall 
of Somalia did not occur with the government there. He was so 
quick to go ahead and withdraw the Remain in Mexico Agreement. 
But for some reason that Doha Agreement, he couldn't make any 
changes to whatsoever. It was absolutely mandatory. No one 
could change anything. Even though he was the elected 
president, that wasn't a complete possibility. Can't understand 
that, but that is something else.
    The other thing is, is that I do agree with my colleague. 
There were many missteps and playing political football through 
multiple administrations and their understanding of what we are 
supposed to be doing and what the mission was to achieve. We 
were not originally there, as we all remember in 2001, to think 
about nation building. We were there for an actual 
counterterrorism operation which was to go in and stop 
Afghanistan from being a safe haven of terror and to withdraw.
    What did we leave? We left the Haqqani Network, ISIS 
Khorasan, the Taliban, billions of dollars in equipment--and 
stronger now than they were before and actually closer, I would 
argue, to achieving the goal of what Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was 
trying to achieve with a caliphate and a singular ISIS 
cohesion, which is what we have left them, a full country to 
now terrorize, exploit, and to utilize.
    He is right that there was over 10 Congresses who had 
gotten this wrong, which is why I ran for Congress. One of the 
main reasons was to try and come in here to prevent what we 
have continued to see, because the majority of Congress by the 
way, only 17 percent, were actual military veterans. And we 
wonder why we get it wrong.
    In my military government service I spent over 7 years of 
my life in Iraq, over 3 years in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Pakistan, 
Northern Somalia. I know a thing or two about poor 
decisionmaking. And I will go ahead and say this: it was not 
the fault of the boots on the ground who was carrying out their 
objectives missions. It was the suits in D.C. who was ruining 
the entire thing.
    We need to understand something: what we were looking into 
is not just the fall of Afghanistan, but also to get an 
accountability for what is already being forgotten, and it is 
shameful. Shameful that we are already forgetting our 13 heroes 
who had fallen at Abbey Gate.
    Our State Department sat here talking about how they were 
there on the ground, helping to find solutions and they were 
with the troops day and night when those gates were available 
to help Americans and others to be able to get out. But my 
question still remains to the State Department. If you were 
there day and night with our military service veterans at those 
gates, then why do we have 13 fallen service members and not a 
single State Department member who had fallen with them? That 
doesn't tell me that you were at the gates when it was 
necessary.
    Mr. Roggio, I got a question for you, sir. Prior to the 
U.S. full withdrawal from Afghanistan you looked at publicly 
available information and warned that Afghanistan was likely to 
fall to the Taliban by the end of summer of 2021, which is 
exactly what we saw happen. Same thing that we warned about 
because we knew that NPRI and others--and again I think it is a 
different hearing, but we should be actually setting up a 
subcommittee that reviews the subcontractors who was more 
worried about supplying information that basically showed them 
in a positive light so they could win more contracts and 
followups as opposed to the ground reality where they were 
evaluating the willingness to fight, the necessary equipment, 
and the strategy on the ground.
    Having said that, from your perspective was the problem 
with the conflicting or incomplete intelligence, the leaders, 
or was it both?
    Mr. Roggio. Sir, I think a mix of both in my experience. I 
created the map where--that we all saw on television over the 
summer of 2001 where I assessed the security in the districts. 
I started that I think in 2014 because I was testing the 
Taliban's counterstrategy to ours. The Taliban said fine, you 
want to protect the cities in key districts. We'll go in the 
rural districts and we'll meet you in the cities. And I began 
gathering data. And over time it became very clear to me that 
the Taliban had a strategy and it was implementing it.
    The problem I think was--I can't just blame the suits, sir. 
I think that part of our military leadership and the top-level 
leadership within the intelligence community is also 
responsible for this and they need to be held to account. We 
were given very rosy assessments that I could easily disprove. 
And journalists who--and other experts who covered--for 
instance there were times where the U.S. estimate that was 
released by SIGAR would say like the province of Kunduz, 
which--I can't remember; I think it has seven districts--SIGAR 
would say something like oh, only one or two are Taliban-
controlled and one or two contested. Everyone who followed 
Afghanistan closely would know that just about all the 
districts were contested and the Taliban controlled at least 
two districts at a time.
    This is what I saw. And some of this was because generals 
didn't want this stuck on their performance view. Some of this 
was political because--look, you had General Milley stand--
General--yes, I'm sorry, General Miller stand up and say--after 
he canceled SIGAR's reporting of the data on the districts he 
stood up and said well, it doesn't matter. Security in the 
districts doesn't matter. What matters is negotiations with the 
Taliban. The top level of the U.S. military was infected by 
this political solution, this negotiated solution. And that has 
significant effects.
    People that I have spoken to during this that were in the 
military and intelligence services, people that worked, that 
did the hard work, they understood what was happening in 
Afghanistan. But as the information made it up the chain of 
command it was softened and softened.
    Why did we need to have for instance statements like 
there's only 50 to 100 Al-Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan, or the 
Taliban ties to Al-Qaeda are weak or non-existent? Because 
ultimately three presidents wanted to leave Afghanistan. 
President Obama, President Trump, and President Biden all 
wanted to leave. And in order to do so there could not be 
significant ties between the Taliban and Al-Qaeda and Al-Qaeda 
could not have a significant presence--look, that's another 
thing that I tracked here. They would tell us 50 to 100 Al-
Qaeda were in Afghanistan and yet we would kill anywhere from 
25 to 75 Al-Qaeda that were--this is was from U.S. military 
zone press releases that I would track.
    Did Al-Qaeda have this sort of steady State where they kept 
it at 50 to 100, where this estimate stayed the same? It only 
went away when we conducted a raid on a terrorist training--or 
two Al-Qaeda training camps in Kandahar in October 2015, I 
believe it was. And they killed almost 200 Al-Qaeda fighters.
    I apologize for telling a long story here, but there were 
significant, significant problems within the military, with--
I'm talking the higher-level leadership within the military, 
within the intelligence community, and with our political 
leadership. And I do hope that a committee is set up to get to 
the bottom of these key issues because if what happened in 
Afghanistan stayed in Afghanistan, oh, well, fine, we lost a 
brush war. Sorry, my Afghan friends, who are our friends. And I 
obviously am being sarcastic there because we should maintain 
commitments to our allies. But it doesn't.
    What happens if we're getting it wrong in Ukraine? What 
happens if we're getting it wrong with Taiwan and China? These 
are the questions that we need to ask.
    Mr. Mills. Well, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for allowing the 
witness to go ahead and fully answer this. I agree we have a 
counting issue. We didn't know how many Americans were left in 
Afghanistan when they said 300, 3,000, 30,000, didn't know. We 
continue to get this wrong and that is why we shouldn't engage 
in warfare unless we are willing to see it through, get back to 
an America first agenda and make sure that we are doing this 
right so we don't repeat Afghanistan again. With that I yield 
back.
    Mr. Mast. Thank you, Mr. Mills.
    I now recognize Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick.
    Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair.
    I want to say thank you so much for all of our members and 
who served in Afghanistan. Thank you for your service. And for 
everyone who is testifying, thank you so much for your service.
    I have a few questions for you, but first I wanted to start 
off that the point of this hearing is for us not to be blame 
shifting, but really to identify and isolate what are the 
instances that happened and so we can look for accountability 
points. And so with that I kind of want to stay away from the 
rhetoric about Trump and who is infatuated with it, but really 
looking to the cumulative effects of the leadership and what 
led to Afghanistan. So I just want to find some facts here.
    I want to start off with a question for Dr. Mukhopadhyay. 
Dr. Mukhopadhyay, we already discussed that at the time of the 
withdrawal there were only 2,500, and we saw that Mr. Roggio 
already admitted that that wasn't a number that could have been 
sustainable toward winning. But I wanted to hear from you about 
that. Do you think that we could have sustained that presence 
in Afghan with only 2,500?
    Ms. Mukhopadhyay. Thank you for your question, 
Congresswoman. I think it's important to understand the 2,500 
number in context, right? I want to underscore something that 
General Sadat said, which I think is very powerful. He said 
after the Doha Agreement, quote, ``politically we could never 
recover,'' unquote.
    I think for me we have to understand how did we get to 
2,500 when we were--we had doubled--five-digit number, right?
    Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick. A clarification. I don't mean to 
interrupt you, but who signed us into the Doha Agreement?
    Ms. Mukhopadhyay. President Trump signed the Doha 
Agreement. So that was an agreement that was negotiated without 
the Afghan government at the table. It was an agreement that 
basically satisfied the minimum American demand and the maximum 
Taliban demand and secured a promise of American withdrawal on 
an established timeline, right? And what that I think did was 
signal--we can talk about the military consequences of having 
troops on the ground or not, but I think the political 
consequences are central. And that's why I underscored General 
Sadat's comment.
    To signal a drop to zero----
    Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick. I wanted to refocus us back to 
the number of troops----
    Ms. Mukhopadhyay. Sure.
    Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick [continuing]. because we are going 
to have more questions. But the sustainability of 2,500 troops, 
was it going to be sustainable to stay there and actually 
assist the Afghans?
    Ms. Mukhopadhyay. No, I don't think so.
    Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick. My next question is for anyone 
who would like to answer it. Now it seems like both 
administrations had the goal to withdraw all the troops. Will 
we agree to that?
    Ms. Mukhopadhyay. Yes.
    Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick. And so with both administrations 
having that goal is there a reason that you believe they would 
both articulate this clear goal at the time?
    Ms. Mukhopadhyay. My understanding is that both 
administrations felt that this--the longest American war needed 
to come to an end. I think that the speed with which the Trump 
Administration moved forward and signaled both to the Taliban 
and the Afghan government that Americans would withdraw no 
matter what began a cascade of events that at that point the 
outcome for the republic was sealed from that point onward.
    Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick. And this question is for anybody 
who wants to answer it: Could you describe in detail how you 
believe the Taliban would respond if the U.S. did not pull out?
    Mr. Roggio. We don't know the answer to that question. We 
certainly never got an opportunity to find out.
    To the point of could 200--2,500 troops have secured or 
have aided the Afghan security forces, I could tell you on 
April 13, 2021, they were aiding.
    Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick. So how could you say with 
substantial certainly that if we had stayed in we would have 
actually won and----
    Mr. Roggio. I certainly can't say with certainly, 
Congresswoman, but what I can say with certainty is that the 
withdrawal order directly led to the collapse of the Afghan 
government and military.
    Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick. And that order was a derivative 
of the Doha Agreement, correct?
    Mr. Roggio. Look, President Trump could have pulled all of 
the troops out of Afghanistan by the day that he left office. 
He did not.
    Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick. Yes.
    Mr. Roggio. President Biden had the opportunity to adjust 
course.
    Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick. Yes.
    Mr. Roggio. Again, he had a decision to make. Was it worth 
supporting the Afghan government or was it not? He chose that 
it wasn't. So look, I mean, I could blame the Bush 
administration, I could blame the--we had--there's two decades 
of blame to go around, but there was only one decision, only 
one order to withdraw, and that was issued on April 14, 2021.
    Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick. I mean, when we say that--when 
you make that statement it makes it seem as if that was 
independent of the agreement. And I am looking for--because you 
said with substantial certainty that if we did not pull out 
that the government would have been standing, but we already 
identified the terms of the agreement, the timeline where we 
had three administrations who were setting us down that road. 
In addition to that we also have both of the administrations 
who were trying to pull out completely.
    With us not identifying with a substantial certainty that 
2,500 could have won and not be able to understand why did both 
administrations try to actually pull out, have that goal, I 
just don't feel comfortable that we have pinpointed what went 
wrong and how can we in the future make sure that this doesn't 
happen again?
    I don't know if you want to extend any more time or if 
anybody can help us find those facts to identify went wrong so 
we can preclude them in the future.
    Mr. Roggio. Yes, I'll just quickly--and I'd like to give my 
fellows an opportunity to speak. I can't build a time machine 
and change the withdrawal order and find out. I wish I could, 
but I certainly cannot. But I just maintain that the Trump 
agreement, there was no bigger critic of it than myself. It was 
a bad deal and it's one that should have been--President Biden 
himself called it a bad deal, and yet he executed that. Why are 
we not asking that question? And with that----
    General Sadat. Ma'am, I think there is a point that we all 
need to understand. Oftentimes, we see the U.S. politicians do 
not understand the capability of their own military. Twenty-
five hundred U.S. trigger-pullers was more than enough to 
support this.
    Ask me this, because the nature of the U.S. operation has 
completely changed. In 2019, when I was commanded of JSOC, we 
partnered with General Chris Donahue, one of the best warriors 
that America has. And by the end of the year, we retook 12 
districts, destroyed four Taliban customs, which was the main 
income of the Taliban. And we have destroyed 34 percent of the 
Taliban combat power, with a new room built which we called it 
a CSAR, Combined Situational Awareness Room.
    The United States' military has a lot of technology, very 
sophisticated. If you allow them politically to use it, to pull 
the trigger--and also, please remember, there was the Afghan 
forces as well. Your troops ended combat operations in 2016. It 
was the Afghans that were fighting. We were protecting American 
bases.
    2021, Congressman Waltz was in Kandahar, and it was 
Afghans. And please know that even though when the Taliban 
wanted to attack the American troops, there was no way they 
could pass the Afghan side of it.
    So it was pointless if they went on a killing spree. 
Believe me, if they could kill an American infidel, they would. 
It was just they didn't have the access. But they sold this so 
expensively on the American side that we're no longer to attack 
your troops.
    The point on President Trump, we also felt that he 
recoursed (phonetic) his decision. And I was, you know, told 
that he wants to keep background, he wants to keep Kandahar. I 
don't want to get into this blame game, but what is happening 
today is as a result of the United States leaving Afghanistan. 
We lost a country.
    And, believe me, you lost reputation. You have less access 
in the world today. You have less capabilities on 
counterterrorism in the world. You have strategic vulnerability 
in Southeast Asia. And you have less comparative advantage by 
not having an allied government inside Afghanistan.
    Even we would have been able to sustain with 2,500 if we 
got continuous----
    Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick. So you can say--thank you so much 
for your giving us this time. But you can say with substantial 
certainty that 2,500 would have been enough, even though the 
other two don't believe so.
    General Sadat. Yes, ma'am. It was enough before they came 
out. It would have been enough.
    Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick. Thank you so much, and thank you, 
Mr. Chairman, for the time.
    Mr. Mast. You are welcome. And I said this once, I will say 
it again. I think it is important to define terms. And as 
Americans, we define terms as win or loss for America. And I 
define that specifically with a win is the way we execute this, 
we end up with outcomes that are better than what we 
anticipated.
    A loss is we end up with outcomes that are worse than what 
we anticipated. And what happened with the way the Biden 
administration did this ended up with outcomes that were 
immeasurably worse than what was anticipated. And that is how I 
define win and loss for America.
    I now recognize my friend, my colleague, Mr. Waltz.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I continue to be 
astounded at these hearings on the focus on the Doha Agreement 
as though it was absolute and irreversible, when the Biden 
administration on day one reversed the Keystone XL, has 
reversed border policy, has reversed Iranian maximum pressure, 
has reversed--reentered, tried to reenter the Iran deal, the 
Paris Accords.
    I mean, we could go down a long list of reversals of this 
administration from the last that it had no issue doing, but 
suddenly we are to believe they were handcuffed.
    So let's go to the capabilities issue. A lot of focus and 
discussion on the 2,500 that President Trump left in place, 
along with our only air base in the world sandwiched between 
Russia, China, and Iran, but it ignores the conversation on the 
tens of thousands of contractors that kept the Afghan air force 
flying.
    President Ghani's last request as President of Afghanistan 
was for President Biden to please at least allow the 
contractors to stay so that the Afghan air force could continue 
to fight. It ignores our intelligence professionals that has 
been plussed-up. It ignores the 7,000 NATO troops that were 
there and had to be fully withdrawn.
    I find this a, quite a convenient narrative. But here nor 
there, I think at the end of the day, while we deeply care 
about our commitment to the Afghans, and it is horrendous what 
is happening to our former allies, despite denials from the 
Deputy Secretary of State, said she has no evidence they are 
being hunted down, really the piece there is international 
terrorism and Afghanistan once again becoming a platform for Al 
Qaeda and Isis.
    So General Sadat, you testified there are thousands of Al 
Qaeda in Afghanistan, training in Afghanistan. Their leaders 
are moving freely in Afghanistan. The U.N. says 30-40 senior Al 
Qaeda leaders moving around freely in Afghanistan with several 
hundred fighters.
    Yet we have President Biden, who just on June 30 of this 
year said, ``Remember what I said about Afghanistan? I said Al 
Qaeda's not there. I was right.'' Patting himself on the back 
in front of a group of reporters.
    So General Sadat, can you speak to Al Qaeda's presence? 
One, and then two, this narrative that don't worry Al Qaeda is 
suddenly the not-so-bad terrorists working with the not-so-bad 
Taliban against the really bad ISIS, which I think is 
conflating local conflicts with--I don't believe for a second 
the Taliban will stop Al Qaeda or ISIS from once again 
attacking Western interests, which is their absolute goal.
    But can you speak to that?
    General Sadat. Thank you. Congressman, there is Al Qaeda 
leaders, Osama bin Laden's oldest son, Abdallah bin Laden, he 
is in Kandahar. He meets often with Hibatullah, the supreme 
leader of Taliban. In fact, he is advising them on Middle East 
and foreign donations collection from the Muslim countries. He 
is married to a Kandahari woman from Arghandab district in 
Kandahar.
    Osama Mehmood, also known as Abu Zar, the leader of Al 
Qaeda in Indian Subcontinent, is in Afghanistan. He lives 
there. Mohammed al Romdi (phonetic), the Al Qaeda's No. 2, 
comes and travels to Afghanistan.
    Mr. Waltz. So just in the--excuse me, General, just in the 
time I have remaining, they fully intend to rebuild and 
reconstitute their ability to attack the West.
    General Sadat. I can tell you with certainty that some of 
the things you see in the Middle East, they have been trained 
in----
    Mr. Waltz. We also have U.N. reporting that Siraj Haqqani, 
the Taliban's Minister of the Interior, issuing passports with 
a functioning international airport to fly Al Qaeda now with 
official documents all over the world. Does anyone dispute that 
on this panel? Do you dispute the UN's reporting on this?
    General Sadat. We agree, some Al Qaeda leaders were given 
passports in order to travel and meet with their Middle Eastern 
allies and branches.
    Mr. Waltz. Can we just switch very quickly, can we talk 
about Bagram and that critical 12,000-foot runway that was 
closer to the Chinese border than Mexico City is to the border 
with Texas? Who's sitting at Bagram now?
    General Sadat. It is the Taliban, Congressman.
    Mr. Waltz. And is there a Chinese presence? Can you speak 
to the Chinese presence now in?
    General Sadat. China wants to take Bagram Air Base as a 
commercial hub. But we know that they could turn it into a 
military air base----
    Mr. Waltz. For what commercial reason? Would it be the, I 
don't know, the world's third largest known lithium supply, 
fifth largest known copper chromite? I mean, the whole slew of 
rare earths and minerals that we are now, we are dependent upon 
in our economy?
    General Sadat. That is correct. China has contracts 
amounting to $20 billion with the Taliban today. And they are 
intending to use the Afghan mines lithium, copper, gas, and oil 
and others.
    China is also bribing the Taliban to allow to build a road 
from China to Iran. Because China has a 25 years' oil deal with 
Iran, so they can travel through Afghanistan if the U.S. Navy 
blocks China in the Indian Ocean.
    Mr. Waltz. General, my time has expired, but General, I 
commend you for standing strong. And I commend people, the 
brave Afghans that continue to resist this oppression.
    I will continue to press the administration on what happens 
if this deal with the devil that they have made with the 
Taliban goes wrong and America is once again attacked. Because 
we will need local allies, as we did when we had to go back 
into Iraq after Obama pulled us out, to continue this fight 
against extremism that the entire world is now seeing 
tragically on full display. So thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Mast. Thank you, Mr. Waltz.
    I spoke in my opening statement about the failure of this 
administration to recognize reality, to live in reality. I am 
going to focus my questions on that.
    Whether it is domestic or foreign policy, they don't look 
at reality. They look at what they think is political reality, 
whether it is with the southern border and saying it is secure. 
Whether it is with saying that inflation is just this 
transitory thing.
    You know, whether it is what was taking place with the 
withdrawal from Afghanistan. And the Security Council or the 
President or the Press Secretary speaking about what was taking 
place.
    Or right up into this moment suggesting that there is 
somehow combat effectiveness in having a cease-fire in the Gaza 
Strip. There is a failure to live in the reality of the 
situation and the reality of the situation for the betterment 
of the United States of America.
    I, in my statement, said I think that that April 14 date of 
go-to-zero was the oh-shit moment. Like, people at that moment 
said wow, I am going to have to get out of Dodge. I am going to 
have to hide my family. I am going to have to find a route out 
of here.
    I am going to find documentation to figure out how I can 
get into some other nation. I am going to be hunted. I don't 
know if I am going to be able to stay in my home. We don't know 
how many people are going to be requesting to get out of 
Afghanistan. And when you multiply wives and children from 8-
28, the list goes on and on.
    I consider that to be an oh-shit moment. But that is me. I 
want to know from you all when did you identify an oh-shit 
moment in that year as we were approaching the withdrawal of 
Afghanistan.
    Or Ms. Mukhopadhyay, Dr. Mukhopadhyay, it doesn't have to 
be that year. I know you spoke about 20 years. But when did you 
identify an oh-shit moment for that?
    Like I said for myself, I capture it in there are ways to 
define win versus loss. And it was in that time that I realized 
we were going to move toward a loss, and this was going to be 
significantly worse than what they are anticipating.
    In that, I will leave it to you all to sort out the order 
in which you choose to answer this. But that is what I would 
like to know from each you, is when did you identify it as 
that.
    Ms. Mukhopadhyay. Thank you, Chairman. I want to start by 
saying that I do remember that announcement, that moment in 
April 2021. And I do remember feeling very nervous.
    I will also just say that August 2021, September, right to 
the present moment for me, for all of us who cared about and 
worked on Afghanistan, has been a deeply challenging time and a 
time for us to reckon with all of our responsibilities on that 
front.
    I would go back, I suppose, to February 2020 as the moment 
when I considered the beginning of the end of the war. I think 
that was the moment when a deal was signed between the United 
States and the insurgency it had been fighting without our 
partner, the Afghan Government, at the table, unambiguously 
subordinating the possibility for peace in Afghanistan to our 
exit and to the demands of the Taliban.
    For me, that is the moment.
    Mr. Roggio. I will say the moment was April 14, 2021. That 
was the moment when everyone got off the fence and the Afghans 
got off the fence. And they had to make decisions.
    At a local level, Taliban commanders would go to district 
leaders or military bases, issue an ultimatum: fight, 
surrender, or just walk away. Some fought, some surrendered, 
some walked away.
    This to me, there was still a U.S. presence. There was 
still hope that the--on April 13, there was still a U.S. 
presence in Afghanistan. There was still hope that the decision 
to stay, that the problems could be fixed.
    I spoke to numerous officials within the Afghan Government, 
within Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Interior. And both over 
the span of a year, from the date of the Doha Agreement being 
signed, even after the withdrawal was announced, some--many, if 
not all, those would be diplomats or an advisor to the 
President, people of that nature.
    They were not convinced that the U.S. was going to leave up 
until August 14, 2021. That is when they knew the U.S. was 
leaving. That is when it all became a reality to them. And that 
is when Afghanistan began to fully unravel.
    General Sadat. Mr. Chairman, I think I agree with you, the 
bad moment was when the announcement came in. But for me, I was 
blindfolded with my brotherhood in friendship with the U.S. 
military. I could never believe that when things go wrong, so 
wrong, the Americans will leave us and the U.S. troops will not 
help me. Will not help General Khoshal or Governor Massoud.
    Because we spent 20 years building relationships. We became 
brothers for real. And we, you know, we would never think that 
the Taliban will be advancing on our cities and the American B-
52 will come and film them and just go away.
    Mr. Chairman, there is horrendous events that the U.S. Air 
Force had filmed in the last months of the war that the Taliban 
were committing war crimes. They were not authorized to conduct 
air strikes against them.
    I think there is three distinct things that needs to be 
recognized. The first thing is end of combat operation in 
Afghanistan. That had already happened.
    The second thing was end of prisons in Afghanistan, which 
President Biden tried to achieve. And the last thing, which is 
important for us, is more than everything, is the end of our 
republic.
    I think these three things have its own definitions. We as 
soldiers fight wars and make peace for a reason. If the reason 
is not achieved, we will continue to fight. If the reason is 
achieved, why is everyone saying that oh, this war needed to 
end? OK, end it in our loss and your loss as well. We lost the 
war.
    We were fighting, the Afghans were bleeding for this war. 
And we just figured out how to win it. The new general officers 
from a younger generation of Afghan leaders, we grew up in the 
last 20 years, went to school with Americans' brats, NATO 
countries, we just became general officers.
    General Khoshal Sadat is sitting here, one of our best 
special forces commanders. He became a general officer in 2018. 
I became a general officer in 2019. Governor Massoud is sitting 
here. He is young Afghan politician from Farah Province. He 
became a Governor in 2021.
    Just as the U.S. real partners took over the responsibility 
that we knew how to fight, how to win, how to strategize and 
how to combine the Afghan mindset and psyche with the U.S. 
technology and strategy. We all spoke the same language, we 
communicated. And this was the moment when the flag was pulled.
    It is just this--a couple of more, like two or three more 
years working together with the Afghans as the new generation 
took over the other generations, we would have won.
    You can--you have been in Afghanistan and Congressman Crow 
was in Afghanistan, and some others. You can speak to this. The 
Afghan special forces were one of the best special forces in 
that region.
    We operated in a dynamic and an environment that I would 
say less special forces in the world could actually take on 
that. So I am telling you it was not the lack of sacrifices on 
our side, it was not lack of capabilities.
    It was a political failure that came from Washington. And 
of course we are blamed for this, we have our responsibilities. 
We have our own political failures back at home from our own 
politicians.
    But what about now? Terrorism is real. Al Qaeda is real. If 
you tell me the United States mainland is safe, I will tell you 
it is not, sir. OK, Al Qaeda may not be able to pull out 
another 9/11 attack today. But they will be able to do it 
tomorrow.
    The United States is not exactly a country that is concise 
within its own borders. You are a global superpower. You 
project power across the country. You have bases, embassies, 
trade routes, envoys, and citizens traveling across the world.
    Are you telling me that those citizens are less important 
than your mainland here? Are they not vulnerable in Africa? Are 
they not vulnerable in Middle East? Can they travel to South 
Central Asia in the next 1 year? Nobody can give me that 
assessment.
    What I am suggesting here is a way forward for us. We are 
ready to partner again. We are ready for the great sacrifice. 
This is why we set up Afghanistan United Front.
    The young generals, young politicians, Afghan soldiers, 
civil society members to come together and craft a future for 
Afghanistan to free ourselves from this religious tyranny, from 
this terrorism.
    We don't like Al Qaeda to be our guest. We refuse to accept 
that. And we need a little bit of help from your side. We need 
political support. Because we don't have a government.
    Remember, when 9/11 happened, you guys came to us. We 
helped you. We went to war not only against Al Qaeda, but we 
went to war against every single individual, every single 
country that was at war with the United States.
    I am not saying it didn't benefit us, it benefited us 
greatly. We built a complete new country, and we are grateful 
and thank you. But the time didn't end.
    The world has become so small that anybody can travel from 
any part of the world and do things in another part of the 
world. So that said, if you allow Al Qaeda and Taliban and 
other extreme organizations to grow in capabilities, to start 
completing their trainings, they will come back and attack you.
    If Al Qaeda starts attacking ten countries, 12 countries 
simultaneously in Middle East and Africa and Europe, can the 
United States respond to that? I am suggesting we go back to 
the root of the problem, we start a new partnership, Mr. 
Chairman. We are ready for it.
    Mr. Mast. Thank you for your reflection, General. Thank you 
all for your answers.
    I now recognize my friend Mr. Burchett.
    Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is an honor to 
call you a friend, brother, thank you for what you did for our 
country. And that you continue to do.
    Before I give my questions, I just want everybody to know 
that Staff Sergeant Ryan Knaus was the last person who died in 
Afghanistan. And he was a constituent of mine. His family are 
dear friends of mine.
    And they named the--I live on a State highway, and they 
named that, at my suggestion, they named that road after him. 
So I am reminded of his sacrifice and the sacrifice you all and 
your people have made. So thank you all so much.
    I am wondering, and you can just answer these briefly, 
because I have got quite a few questions. General Sadat, what 
was the fighting like with the Taliban before President Biden's 
go-to-zero Order, and what was it like after?
    General Sadat. Sir, on the 31st of April, the last of 
American troops left from Helmand. On the first of May, the 
attacks in Helmand has decreased by 380 percent. This was like 
influx of hundreds and hundreds of Taliban driving from Iran 
and Pakistan.
    The first prevention capital they wanted to capture was 
Helmand, where my command was. Unfortunately, Helmand is 
located just as a node in front of Iran and Pakistan. In the 4-
months that continued, the Taliban has lost 10,000 of their 
forces. But they couldn't take Lashkar Gah.
    They conducted 17 suicide attacks only against myself when 
I was moving from one front line to another. But they couldn't 
take what they wanted to take. But the fighting was vicious. We 
lost a lot of people. Taliban lost a lot of people.
    It was very tough, very difficult. It was like in the 
movies. And you can only see it in some of the World War II 
movies, except it was real.
    Mr. Burchett. All right. My father fought in the Second 
World War, so, in the Pacific, so thank you. Were the women and 
girls allowed to go to school before President Biden withdrew 
from Afghanistan?
    General Sadat. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Burchett. And I assume they are not now, that is 
correct--is that correct? No? OK.
    Mr. Roggio, is that how you pronounce that name?
    Mr. Roggio. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Burchett. Oh, got it right. How many articles or 
studies did the Foundation for Defense of Democracies publish 
about the Taliban possibly taking over before it happened?
    Mr. Roggio. I couldn't count, sir. We publish numerous 
studies on--yes, I honestly, sir, I just----
    Mr. Burchett. You weren't surprised.
    Mr. Roggio. Yes, no, I wasn't surprised. This is something 
we warned about.
    Mr. Burchett. Right. Were you surprised at how fast they 
did take over?
    Mr. Roggio. No, sir.
    Mr. Burchett. OK. Why does this administration continue to 
say they were surprised by how quickly the Taliban regained 
control? I mean, everybody was talking about it. Everybody said 
it was going to happen. It was on the news. It just seemed to 
me, you know, that with them to say that to me was just 
ridiculous.
    Mr. Roggio. It would be an admission that they--if they 
knew that Afghanistan would have collapsed so quickly then, and 
they withdrew anyway, it would have been an admission that they 
left Afghanistan to the predations of the Taliban.
    Mr. Burchett. OK. Why does this administration continue to 
say, though, why would they say they are surprised? I mean, 
they just have to admit--they just have to admit they were 
wrong?
    I mean, it is kind of like our southern border. They can't 
admit we got a problem with fentanyl because they would have to 
admit it is coming over the southern border.
    I mean, it is the same type of deal. It is kind of a 
diversion in my opinion. It just seems to me, you made a 
mistake, let's move on, take your lumps and go.
    Mr. Roggio. Yes, I, you know, I think this administration--
look, either it understands that Afghanistan was going to 
collapse, or it didn't know. Neither is good. So it has 
maintained the quick collapse narrative in order to not--you 
know, this administration doesn't want to reflect on its 
failure in issuing the order to withdraw from Afghanistan.
    Even the State Department report that was issued, oh, I 
want to say a month or two ago, you know, the primary blame was 
placed on President Trump. And as I have said numerous times, 
that Doha deal was a mistake, but it was a mistake that could 
be corrected.
    The withdrawal could not--the administration clearly hoped 
that it would gain some type of Vietnamesque decent interval. 
Withdrawal from Afghanistan, maybe it collapses in a year or 
two, and they could point the finger at the Afghan Government.
    Mr. Burchett. I am running out of time. Real quick, if the 
evacuation were properly planned, would the attack at Abbey 
Gate have occurred?
    Mr. Roggio. No, that would have been an extremely difficult 
attack to have been carried out at Bagram. Anyone who has been 
to Kabul, which I have, and of course my panelists have as 
well, knows that conducting an evacuation from Hamid Karzai 
International Airport would have resulted in an absolute 
disaster. A private in the U.S. Army would have understood 
this, sir.
    Mr. Burchett. OK. Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Mr. Mast. Thank you, Mr. Burchett. You should know I have, 
you know, while I pinpoint us on starting on time, I have a 
laissez-faire approach to stopping the clock for individuals. 
If you are saying something valuable, we want to hear it, so.
    I now recognize my friend Mr. Crow again for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Crow. Thank you, Chairman.
    Dr. Mukhopadhyay, I would like to go back to you. You 
earlier were trying to provide some additional context around 
the issue of the draw-down and the troop number. And I would 
love to hear you finish that line of thinking.
    Because I think the context around that and what was going 
on politically and within Afghanistan in the months and years 
leading up to that is very important here.
    Ms. Mukhopadhyay. Thank you, Congressman. Yes, actually in 
2019, I wrote a piece for Lawfare in which I talked about as 
the debate was happening and around what the troop numbers 
should be, and it was very contentious, as you will no doubt 
recall. I was of the view, as General Sadat explained, that 
Afghan forces were doing the bulk of the fighting.
    So really what was significant about our troop presence, in 
addition to all of the support that contractors provided, was 
the political import of the troop presence. Because the 
political import for me was a signal on the part of the 
Americans to Afghan elites, to soldiers and citizens, and to 
the Taliban, and to the neighbors that the U.S. Government had 
confidence in and investment in the republic.
    So the question of how to end the war, I think we all know 
that Republicans and Democrats agreed the war needed to come to 
an end. The question was how to do that responsibly.
    The reason that I keep coming back to the Doha Agreement, 
but really it is not just the Doha Agreement, right. It is 
starting with the negotiations that began by President Trump in 
2018. Was that that set of negotiations signaled to the Afghan 
Government, to the Taliban, to the Afghan people that in fact 
the U.S. Government no longer had confidence in and investment 
in the republic.
    I think it is important to say when we keep zeroing in on 
April 2021 that as Mr. Roggio's own data shows, that only 129 
of the 407 districts in Afghanistan at that time were fully 
controlled by the government, right.
    This, again, this was a process of the Taliban recognizing 
that it was winning and the Afghan Government being in a 
position to never be quite clear to be able to predict what is 
going to happen.
    Because President Trump raised the number of troops, then 
dropped the number of troops, then changed his mind, then 
signed the agreement, then dropped the number below what the 
commitment actually was to the Taliban.
    I can tell you that even after the April 21 announcement, I 
was in Kabul in June 2021, and it was very clear to me that 
senior members of the Afghan Government did not believe that 
the Americans were going to leave. And I don't think that we 
can attribute that to President Biden's decision.
    It was a much longer pattern of feeling a sense 
simultaneously on the one hand, as General Sadat said, that we 
would never abandon them, and on the other hand a sense that at 
any moment we might abandon them. And that unpredictability was 
most acute in the Trump period.
    There is plenty of blame to go across, as I said in my 
opening comments, across all four administrations. But that 
kind of unpredictability around troop numbers created a sort of 
political instability in Afghanistan that I don't think--that 
was a domino effect after February 2020 that I don't think we 
could have reversed.
    Mr. Crow. Thank you for that.
    General Sadat, to you for a moment. This is not a trick 
question, I have no idea the answer to it. I am really curious 
your thought on this.
    Is there an amount of time that, after 20 years, more than 
20 years--well, about 20 years, that the U.S. could have kept 
troops there, but then the Afghan forces could have stood on 
their own? And then we could have gone to zero? Do you have 
that number in your head?
    Because I mean, we had been talking--we tried all the 
different, as Mr. Roggio said, all the different levels, all 
the different surge strategies, different tactics. We tried so 
many different things.
    I am just wondering if there is an amount of time in your 
head that if you had just, you know, x more years, that the 
outcome would have been different.
    General Sadat. It wouldn't have been about the years, it 
was about the approach. I think to be honest, we have to go 
back a little bit on negotiations.
    Negotiations with Taliban started in 2011 when they opened 
an official office in Doha. It was during President Obama, 
pulling out five detainees out of the prison and the next day 
giving them a political stature globally.
    I think if that didn't begun, the Americans negotiated with 
Afghan Government directly about your leaving, our country 
wouldn't have collapsed. In case that we continued to receive 
the amount of support in terms of military and combat from the 
U.S.
    I think what killed us, sir, that we could never recover 
was the fact that the U.S. Government went behind our back and 
spoke to our enemy, made a deal with our enemy, making us look 
like we are the outsiders. And the real deal is with the 
Taliban.
    I think without the U.S. Government talking to the Taliban, 
the Afghan Government would have absolutely not only sustained 
but we would actually succeed because of the reasons I just 
mentioned, the younger generation of Afghans. You fought and 
worked with Afghan military. We raised through the ranks, and 
20 years was the time we grew up in politics and military.
    I have a young colonel here, Colonel Parwani, he is not 
even 30 years old. But he was leading vicious wars in Kunduz 
and in Kandahar and in Helmand. So they became more 
sophisticated, more capable.
    I believe it would have been--look, Afghanistan became a 
political toy a little bit. When President Bush was in charge, 
that was the best chance for Afghanistan. We appreciate, we 
honor President Bush. He listened to Afghans. We worked with 
the Afghans.
    When President Obama came, President Obama and President 
Karzai had bad relationship between each other. So it affected 
us. Then President Biden, back then Vice President, came and 
fought with our president. And their relationship became 
stained. It further affected us.
    I sometimes feel like President Biden has a vendetta 
against Afghans. The way he comments on us, the way he treats 
Afghans. The other couple of months ago, he wanted to give our 
money to 9/11 victims.
    Some of these things, look, we are a nation. We are a great 
nation. Our people are very proud people. We are the most loyal 
people that you can find if you become our allies. If you 
become our enemies, we will fight to our death.
    We are not just going to disappear tomorrow. We will rise 
again. We will get rid of the Taliban. And we hope that we can 
do it together with you. And it will be good for you to have a 
friend, to have an ally in that part of the world. We will take 
care of your interests as well as long as you give us some 
support.
    Things have happened, awful things, bad things. But I am 
asking humbly this congress, please, let's focus on what we can 
do together in the future.
    Mr. Crow. Thank you, General.
    Mr. Mast. Thank you. I am going to ask a couple more 
questions myself now. And circled around the go-to-zero order.
    Mr. Roggio, can you discuss that in relationship to Taliban 
advancements?
    Mr. Roggio. Yes. So by August, or I'm sorry, by April 2021, 
just again, I want to be clear that the map I created is an 
assessment. You could flip some of these numbers either way. 
But it painted a picture. A picture, by the way, that was very 
close to what the Special Investigator General for Afghanistan 
Reconstruction posed.
    There's differences between our methods and when their data 
was released. My data was real-time, their data was always 90 
days old. So it was always difficult to compare, but it was 
always 5-15 percent in together.
    Anyway, somewhere--the Afghan Government--the Taliban 
controlled about 70 districts. The Afghan Government, I believe 
you gave the number, I don't have them off the top of my head.
    It is somewhere around 120 or so. And the rest were 
contested. That meant that the Afghan military was battling the 
Taliban for control of these districts.
    That number stayed pretty steady from 2020 to 2021, give or 
take. And as General Sadat noted, there was a significant--when 
President Trump, when he restructured his Afghanistan policy, 
the Taliban actually lost control of the districts.
    And the Afghans, they lost control of about 25 districts. 
So they are at their low peak of the numbers were in the 50's 
of the districts they controlled. The number of contested 
districts actually went down as well.
    So, and as General Sadat noted, the Afghan military was 
conducting primary security responsibilities. After by the end 
of May, middle of June, the Taliban doubled the number of their 
districts that they controlled.
    It was clear that they were waiting for this moment, for 
the U.S. withdraw, in order to launch its offensive. As General 
Sadat noted, fighters were flowing from Iran and Pakistan into 
Helmand and----
    Mr. Mast. Let me pause. It is clear to you.
    Mr. Roggio. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Mast. It is clear to me. Let me just ask that 
pointedly. Was it clear to you, General Sadat?
    General Sadat. Sir, I was blindfolded again. I didn't 
believe that this day will happen. Maybe I was in full denial. 
It was my country. I was--it was clear toward the end because 
every day I was waiting for my own death as I was fighting in 
the front line. So, yes, when, you know, we didn't get support. 
I got B-52 a couple of times, you know, chaired up (phonetic). 
It didn't support me, it didn't drop bombs. So yes, we were 
doomed.
    Mr. Roggio. Congressman, if I could just maybe add one 
thing. U.S. military by the middle of June, their numbers of 
the districts that they were saying were controlled by the 
Taliban were half the numbers that I was reporting. And then 
within 2 weeks, their numbers matched mine.
    Mr. Mast. Why do you think that was?
    Mr. Roggio. Because the U.S. military was telling us that 
the withdrawal was being conducted in orderly fashion and the 
Afghan military or I'm sorry, the Afghan Government was not in 
danger of collapse. Admitting such a rapid degradation in the 
security in the districts in Afghanistan would have been 
admission that that policy was failing.
    The administration, again, wanted to leave Afghanistan. It 
was not going to change its policy, even though the facts on 
the ground were showing that the security situation was 
deteriorating----
    Mr. Mast. Is there anybody specific that you attribute to 
telling you that?
    Mr. Roggio. Oh, it was General Milley himself said it on 
television.
    Mr. Mast. How do you, General Sadat, looking at what Mr. 
Roggio just said, what was being put out in the media here, 
what was being said by General Milley, what was being put out 
in intelligence, how did that rosy--we will call it a rosy 
assessment, that is an understatement. It is an understatement 
to call it a rosy assessment.
    How did that affect your decisionmaking on the ground? Did 
you buy into it? Did you not buy into it? You mentioned already 
that it gave you some blinders to some extent, your 
relationships. But can you help elaborate on that just a little 
bit?
    General Sadat. Sir, the truth of the matter is after 
President Biden announced withdrawal, the U.S. forces and 
Afghan forces were in complete disarray with each other. 
Everybody was trying. The U.S. forces were ordered to leave the 
Afghan forces we were trying to hold with our teeth, with our 
hands, whatever we could, we could have got.
    So no, nothing really mattered to me anymore whatever 
Washington was saying. I was trying very hard with my brothers 
to save our country. The truth of the matter is it was 
excruciating to separate two war brothers, two--like two 
militaries that worked for 20 years. Suddenly we were told not 
to work anymore.
    Mr. Mast. You are saying what Washington was saying, and I 
am not trying to put words in your mouth here. I am actually, I 
am trying to understand what you are saying. What Washington 
was saying didn't matter to you at all on the ground there 
because it was----
    General Sadat. I didn't trust them.
    Mr. Mast. Garbage, it was crap.
    General Sadat. I don't want to jump into the--I have a lot 
of respect for the U.S. military, for the veterans. I have 
worked with the CIA as a counterterrorism task force commander, 
with the U.S. military for several years.
    But it seems as if when it came to Afghanistan, during 
President Biden, a lot of the decisions made in the U.S. 
military and in the CIA were very, very politically driven.
    Sometimes they told us that as we don't know about what 
President Biden is thinking and deciding, they didn't know as 
well. President Trump, of course he had made mistakes. The Doha 
Agreement was a mistake.
    But he listened to his generals. He listened to the 
assessments. He sent us letters about how can we win, for 
example, what can we do these things.
    But I think when it came to President Biden, the vendetta 
didn't really allow President Biden to see Afghanistan for what 
it is.
    Even today as this administration's diplomats are going 
around the world and lobbying for Taliban, the fact that 
everyone is trying to push Afghanistan under the rug, sir, is 
going to hurt your national security. You are not recognizing 
the threat as it is.
    Mr. Mast. I appreciate that, General.
    I now recognize my friend Mr. Nunn.
    Mr. Nunn. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate you, Chairman 
Mast, for leading this very important after-action. It is the 
only one that has really been done in the House here, despite 
nearly 2 years of an absentee administration evaluating its own 
failures.
    I have flown enough combat missions in both Afghanistan and 
Iraq to know what success looks like, including support to 
special operations Afghan forces on the ground in the area, as 
well as to know what failure looks like. In this case the 
failure in the withdrawal from Kabul resulted in volunteer 
veterans, myself and many included through Task Force Argo, 
helping to evacuate 3,000 individuals.
    For those individuals in the audience who have been part of 
that incredible volunteer team, a salute to each of you. You 
have done more than our own Federal Government has done to help 
save Americans in that horrible situation.
    I want you to know that in every mission that we flew, when 
we landed, we immediately did a post-flight report. That is the 
critical after-action that really drives so that we can prevent 
failure in the future and advance successes that can be 
replicated.
    Your testimony today does so in a way that the rest of the 
administration has refused to acknowledge.
    Sadly, 13 Americans gave their lives in the evacuation, 
including Corporal Daegan Page from my own district in Red Oak, 
Iowa, who manned the line, despite intelligence being very 
clear that there was a threat in the area, sacrificing so the 
other Americans and Afghan allies could evacuate.
    The honor and bravery of these American soldiers will never 
be forgotten. Their sacrifice in the theater of combat forever 
reminds us that our freedom is not free.
    As geopolitical tensions across the globe continue to rise, 
the U.S. military must be prepared for future events that could 
have been learned years ago from our withdrawal from 
Afghanistan.
    So we are going to go Air Force style, and I am going to do 
gun ship questions here. That is meant to be the ability for us 
to get back and forth very quickly here.
    Lieutenant General Sadat, now, you led special forces in 
Afghanistan. In fact, you are still on a hit list by the 
Taliban in country today for the service that you rendered in 
the defense of Americans and your country.
    I want to begin by first thanking you very much for all 
that you have done to help save the lives of our brothers and 
sisters in uniform. But also to your own country. Your service 
and sacrifice is not unnoticed.
    I would begin with saying did you find that the Biden 
administration communicated a plan for withdraw to your team in 
a timely manner?
    General Sadat. No, sir, there was no team--no plan, sorry. 
A plan is when it is communicated to the partners on the 
ground. We were Afghans, we owned Afghanistan. We were in 
charge there. There was no plan shown to us.
    Mr. Nunn. As a result, were your special operators put at 
great risk?
    General Sadat. They were at great risk, even----
    Mr. Nunn. Were Americans who depended on you to be the 
front line also put at great risk?
    General Sadat. I think the confusion was real, and it put 
everybody at risk.
    Mr. Nunn. What was the impact of President Biden's go-to-
zero order on assistance that the U.S. was providing to the 
Afghan military? Did it degrade your capabilities?
    General Sadat. It immediately shut down all software 
system, including the aircraft software system for intelligence 
collection navigation and other matters.
    Mr. Nunn. I want to deep dive with you on that. As a recon 
airborne guy myself here, to the best of your knowledge, was 
close air support or armed over-watch, or even over-watch of an 
intel asset provided during the evacuation of Kabul?
    General Sadat. There were airplanes, but they didn't have 
the authority to pull the trigger.
    Mr. Nunn. Did you ever receive updates from them on what 
was happening real time on the ground?
    General Sadat. No, sir.
    Mr. Nunn. What was the U.S. retrograde of Air Force cover 
in the immediate vicinity's impact to your team on the ground?
    General Sadat. One day in June I called the U.S. forces in 
Doha to give me support, and they said every day we can only 
send three drones to Afghanistan. I said we used to have 20 
drones, why not. They said the country of Oman is only allowing 
three drones per day.
    This is the time that across Afghanistan over 500 
engagements are happening between Afghan and the Taliban 
forces. The U.S. could only get three drones to Afghanistan, 
and those were used to support the U.S. presence in Kabul, the 
embassy, and also the----
    Mr. Nunn. General, we have talked about how degraded your 
forces were, as a result how vulnerable both Americans and 
Afghans were. What did the go-to-zero order have on the Taliban 
at this same time?
    General Sadat. It was celebration. They distributed sweets 
amongst each other, saying that the best has happened and we 
are going to take over the country.
    It also gave them this, what do you say, this steroids. 
Therefore a lot of them killed themselves, actually. It was 
unbelievable. What I saw was the zombies rushing into to take 
over the streets and cities, although they died in hundreds.
    Mr. Nunn. General, for your troops, for the forces you 
commanded, the abandonment by the Biden administration, what 
happened to the special operations forces that were left behind 
in Afghanistan?
    General Sadat. Some were killed, and some 30,000 Afghan 
forces are in Taliban prison. Some 10,000 special operators are 
in Iran, but every day they are being arrested, tortured, and 
sent back to Afghanistan.
    The other day I got a call from Colonel Raziq (phonetic). 
He is one of the police officers who served under Khoshal in 
Pakistan. He lost one of his legs in Grishk District of 
Helmand. The police took over his prosthetic leg and had him 
crawl for 30 feet into reaching the car. He called me back and 
he said, sir, what do you want me to do? Should I kill myself, 
go to Afghanistan, or go to Iran?
    In Iran, our officers, general officers and colonels are 
working in flour mills. They are doing dirt jobs. They are 
working in street cleaning. Whatever money they earn, they have 
to give for visa. Iranian visa is very, very expensive. When 
their visas expire, they are being kicked back to Afghanistan. 
And the Taliban immediately arrests them, and then they 
disappear from the radar.
    Mr. Nunn. General, thank you very much for your service, 
for the service of the forces under you. It is never an 
advantage or a wish to have to lose our own forces at the hands 
of the enemy. It is even worse when we have to hand our own 
forces over to the enemy.
    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you very much for leading on 
this. And I want to emphasize the fact here that after two 
decades of service by both American men and women and by your 
own countrymen, we leave behind a situation worse than where we 
found it. And we put on the altar of sacrifice the very men and 
women who stood up for a future of Afghans.
    Know that you have allies here. Thank you for the after-
action.
    I yield my time, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Mast. Thank you, Mr. Nunn.
    Mr. Crow, you are recognized for a closing statement.
    Mr. Crow. Thank you, Chairman. And thank you all to the 
witnesses. This was a really important discussion, and thank 
you again to the folks in the audience for your service and 
sacrifice in a lot of different and very important ways.
    I wanted to just discuss for a moment something that 
General Sadat said. And you made a really important comment, 
General. And behind that comment was this idea that over 20 
years, the United States had 100,000 troops there at one point. 
We tried many different strategies, many different approaches.
    I will ardently push back all the time on anybody that says 
that the Afghans were not willing to fight for their country. I 
mean, that is an absurd comment. And it is one that deserves to 
be called out whenever it is said.
    Because I don't need to tell you all the heart, the grit, 
the sacrifice, how many of your brothers and sisters gave 
everything for your country.
    So it wasn't that. It wasn't, you know, the lack of a 
willingness of the Afghans to fight. So it really was this 
issue of politics. It really was this issue of the message that 
was being sent and the lack of an ability to have a viable 
political process that set the Afghan Government up for 
success.
    For me, the conclusion to that is that that whole problem 
happened way before April 2021. And again, my criticisms and 
critiques of the manner of the withdrawal are well-documented, 
right.
    There were a lot of problems. I have been very clear about 
that, and we owe it to people to make sure we are correcting 
those, and that in the future, God forbid if we are ever in a 
situation of conducting a NEO of that magnitude again, that we 
fix it, and we do it better and we do it differently.
    But the concrete had hardened so much by that point, from a 
political perspective, that from the Taliban's point of view, 
it was very clear America was done. It was clear we were going 
to leave. At some point or another, it was clear, probably 
years ago, that that was going to happen. Which put everybody 
in untenable situation.
    I have learned to take people's word in this business that 
a lot of times if you actually listen to them, they will just 
tell you, right.
    So I wanted to go to back to the former President. This was 
former President Trump at a rally in Ohio on June 26, 2021. 
This is what he said. ``I started the process. All the troops 
are coming back home. They couldn't stop the process. Twenty-
one years is enough, don't we think? Twenty-one years. They 
couldn't stop the process. They wanted to, but it was very 
tough to stop the process.''
    Message after message, time and again, it was clear to the 
Taliban the way this was going to go.
    I am sorry to all of you, to my Afghan brothers and 
sisters. You deserve better. And I am willing to talk with my 
colleagues here and to continue to talk with all of you about 
what we can do to keep the faith and to move forward.
    Because there are things that we can do. This is a story 
that I don't believe is done. And we will continue to work with 
you on that.
    One other call here, in addition to our policy with regard 
to Afghanistan, is we have obligations that we have not yet 
fulfilled to those who are still left behind, our partners and 
our brothers and sisters who are seeking refuge, who are 
hiding, who every day are fearing for their lives.
    We must pass the Afghan Allies Protection Act to expand the 
special immigrant visa program, to expand the P-1 and P-2 
programs, to streamline that process, and to do everything 
possible to continue evacuations from Afghanistan to get people 
to safety. That is our obligation.
    In addition to that, we must pass the Afghan Allies 
Adjustment Act to make sure that those who we have got out of 
Afghanistan have a clear path to start a new life in the United 
States, because they will be incredible citizens. They will be 
incredible parts of our community, I know it. They are my 
neighbors already in many respects, and we owe it to them.
    With that, I yield back.
    Mr. Mast. Thank you, Mr. Crow.
    Like any event, the game ultimately ends. And throughout 
the game, there's mistakes that are usually made on both sides, 
but in the end there is a winner and a loser. I defined winner 
and loser as the outcomes being better than expected or the 
outcomes being worse than expected, and that is how I give that 
definition. And I think it is quantifiable.
    This resulted in a loss. Outcomes worse than expected, 
immeasurably worse than expected. For not just what was the 
moment. Certainly to this moment, and likely for at least a 
generation to come.
    That happened because of abandonment and ignorance. 
Ignoring reconnaissance, intelligence, surveillance at a basic 
level. Just looking. And just to look, you had to willfully 
ignore what was taking place to get to the loss, the worse 
expectations, or the worse outcomes compared to what could have 
been expected.
    You had to willfully ignore what was taking place on the 
ground. And you had to abandon the people on the ground in 
order to reach what the administration wanted to reach, which 
is what they announced on the go-to-zero day, September 11 
withdraw. Political withdraw date. Political celebration 
withdraw date.
    Let's reach a day that is an anniversary of the 9/11 
attacks and make that our withdraw date, no matter what. No 
matter, we are going to do this. It doesn't matter if we ignore 
how many special immigrant visas need to be issued, and if 
those people won't be able to get the documentation that they 
need because there's no Americans on the ground.
    It doesn't matter how many provinces are being taken over. 
It doesn't matter the Taliban advancement. It doesn't matter if 
we have to leave these air bases and retreat to another one.
    It doesn't matter if we have to call on an unnumbered 
amount of civilians not working for the State Department or the 
Department of Defense to come in and help get people out. 
Definitely not a part of any plan.
    It doesn't matter what has to happen, we are going to 
abandon, we are going to ignore in order to get to the 
political outcome that we desire. That resulted in a loss. 
Outcome worse than expectations.
    I thank you all for your testimony, your eyewitness 
accounts, your firsthand accounts. Sharing your heart about how 
you felt about the situation at the time, rehashing that. It is 
of great value to each and every one of us on both sides of the 
aisle.
    Members of the subcommittee may have some additional 
questions for each and every one of you. I hope that you will 
respond to those in writing.
    Pursuant to committee rules, all members may have 5 days to 
submit those statements, questions, and extraneous materials 
for the record, subject to the length limitations. And without 
objection, this committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 3:55 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
