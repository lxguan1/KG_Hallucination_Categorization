  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BILL JOHNSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
                CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO

    Mr. Johnson. The committee will come to order.
    First, I want to say thank you to a few people. I give 
special thank you to Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers and all 
our staff, especially the committee staff, for the hard work 
putting this hearing together during such a busy time, and to 
the Members on both sides for preparing and attending this 
important hearing today.
    When I first received this gavel, I never imagined that our 
first subcommittee hearing would be on something that hits so 
close to home. So I want to especially thank all of my 
colleagues here on both sides of the aisle for your continued 
well wishes for my constituents and for your genuine concern, 
participation, and willingness to help this small, rural Ohio 
community.
    Next, I recognize and thank the first responders at the 
State and local level who were on the scene immediately, who 
ran into the danger, risking their lives to respond to this 
incident with professionalism and bravery. In particular, I 
recognize the firefighters, the all-volunteer firefighters in 
East Palestine who jumped into action into the smoke and fire 
to quite literally save the lives of their neighbors in this 
small, tight-knit village of fewer than 5,000 people. It is a 
spirit of unity and selflessness much more common outside of 
the Beltway than within it. But I will speak on that a little 
more in a moment.
    Since this disaster happened, when we aren't in session 
here in Washington I have been in East Palestine, listening to 
the concerns of residents and meeting with local and State 
officials and Federal agencies. This includes our three 
witnesses here today. We have spent a lot of time in person, on 
the phone, talking about these things lately.
    These witnesses have all been deeply involved in the 
response efforts, and I thank each of them for their commitment 
to assisting the East Palestine community and for their 
willingness to take the time to appear before our subcommittee 
today.
    Administrator Shore and Director Vogel, I thank you two, 
specifically, for representing your agency so well, for you and 
your team's responsiveness from the State and Federal EPAs. 
Your effective coordination has been and remains key to getting 
this cleanup and long-term remediation done right.
    And a very special welcome to Dr. Wes Vins, Columbiana 
County health commissioner, who has been on the front lines 
since the very beginning. Wes is a problem solver. And no 
matter if you are a Republican or a Democrat, he is ready to 
work with anyone to ensure the safety and health of our 
community.
    Wes, thanks for being here. Your input will be extremely 
valuable to our subcommittee as we dig into these important 
issues today.
    So that brings us to theme of our hearing today. The intent 
of this hearing is to be precise and targeted, to get answers 
for the still-suffering residents of East Palestine. Our goal 
simply is to try and know what we don't yet know. The longer 
this goes on, more and more questions arise about the long-term 
health effects of chemical exposure, the testing that is needed 
for the soil, water, and air, and the commitment of those 
responsible for the cleanup.
    In addition, the cleanup--which is still ongoing, by the 
way--has been a bumpy road, to say the least. As we speak, 
there is a many-thousands-of-tons-of-toxic-dirt pile still 
sitting there, very slowly being trucked out because the proper 
legal certified disposal process was improperly turned into a 
political football. I do wonder if this train derailment in 
inner--had occurred in inner-city Philadelphia or an affluent 
Chicago suburb rather than rural flyover Ohio country, would 
those communities get the same treatment?
    So to those watching today, I know that many of you 
probably saw in the news the plume seen around the world at the 
outset of this disaster. Almost immediately, folks on all sides 
of the political spectrum wanted to use this tragedy for photo 
ops or political gain on the national stage, or to drive clicks 
on social media.
    But here is what we know: At some point the cameras will go 
away, the news cycle will move on to something that gets better 
ratings, but for this small community, this isn't over. It 
isn't going away. To them, it is very real. Families are still 
displaced from their homes, and children are missing school. 
These folks don't just get to move on to the next thing. It is 
our job today to get answers for them, not to play politics at 
their expense.
    Now, I know this happened in my district, so it is personal 
to me. I acknowledge that. But it could have happened in any of 
my colleagues' districts. It is our job to reassure this small 
community that here in Congress on this committee we will work 
to ensure the cleanup is completed and that we will not stop 
our questions and oversight until the health and environmental 
concerns of this community are addressed, because we would do 
the same, regardless of where it had happened.
    Now, I understand that our roles as national policy makers 
are significant here also. I know that there has been some 
disappointment from my Democratic colleagues that the railroad 
isn't here today. More specifically, I read about this 
disappointment in a press release the minority blasted out late 
last Thursday evening.
    I want my friends on the other side of the aisle who have 
not visited the site, have not seen the mountain of 
contaminated dirt still looming over the village, and who have 
not spent time with the worried families there to understand 
this: this hearing isn't about you, it is not about me or any 
member of this subcommittee. This hearing is about them, the 
citizens of East Palestine. It is about those worried families 
who have had their lives flipped upside down. It is about 
getting them answers and ensuring their long-term health, 
period. That is what it is about.
    Many aspects of this incident, the response and the 
cleanup, fall directly under this committee's jurisdiction. 
Whether it be CERCLA, hazardous waste disposal, chemical 
safety, EPA oversight, there is a lot to unpack here. But if 
you want to talk rail safety, let's do that after this hearing.
    In fact, I introduced bipartisan rail safety legislation 
with my friend and colleague, fellow Ohio Congresswoman Emilia 
Sykes, 2 weeks ago that I urge you all to consider cosponsoring 
if you truly want to help prevent what happened in East 
Palestine from happening again. There--that is a way we can 
hold railroads more accountable. But that legislation will have 
to go through the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
    So I urge my colleagues to please take our responsibility 
here today seriously. There are lessons to be learned from what 
happened in East Palestine, and we can use that as members of 
the Environment Subcommittee to inform our work for the 
American people.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Johnson follows:]
   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Johnson. With that, I recognize the ranking member, Mr. 
Tonko, for 5 minutes.
    And I know I went over my time, so I will give you some 
additional time, too, if you need it.

   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PAUL TONKO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK

    Mr. Tonko. That is fine, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chair, 
and thank you to our witnesses for joining us today.
    Mr. Chair, I would like to again offer my support to you 
and your constituents in East Palestine. I am prepared to work 
with you to do whatever we must do to protect the public health 
and environment of the community and surrounding areas and to 
hold Northern--Norfolk Southern accountable. I know recovering 
from a disaster like this will require a long-term commitment, 
and the community deserves clear and consistent communication 
about ongoing remediation activities and any remaining risks.
    Today we will have the opportunity to learn about the 
government response to the derailment. The U.S. EPA, the Ohio 
EPA, and the Columbiana County Health District, along with 
numerous other State and local agencies, have played roles in 
the response effort to date. It is important for us to 
understand what happened, how intergovernmental coordination 
has worked, and what lessons can be learned for future incident 
responses.
    But we must also remember that Norfolk Southern is 
responsible for this disaster, not these agencies. And while I 
believe today's hearing will be worthwhile because there is 
much we can learn from the witnesses, I am disappointed that 
Norfolk Southern is not testifying alongside these government 
officials for a thorough discussion. Norfolk Southern is a 
critical part of the response effort's Unified Command and is 
responsible for carrying out remediation activities. By not 
hearing the company's perspective, we are not getting the full 
picture. So I do hope we can have an additional hearing to 
examine their role in the response and in the recovery efforts.
    We know that successful responses to industrial disasters 
require cooperation amongst all levels of government. It is 
only through a closely coordinated effort that a comprehensive 
response can be achieved, including communicating risks to 
affected residents. I do know this response was not perfect, 
and I hope we can learn more about what worked and truly what 
failed in order to inform other communities' preparedness 
planning.
    I also know that after the immediate response there begins 
a much longer and more difficult remediation effort. After the 
camera crews are gone, we cannot forget about the people that 
will continue to live with the fallout from this disaster. But 
I have no doubt that EPA will continue to enforce its laws and 
conduct oversight of Norfolk Southern's remediation efforts. 
And certainly, congressional oversight of EPA can help keep 
remediation activities on track both in East Palestine and in 
other contaminated sites across our country, because, sadly, 
the situation is not unique.
    There are hundreds of communities across our great country 
along the fence lines of ports and rail yards and power plants 
and industrial facilities that may never make the news but 
whose residents are often exposed to harmful air, harmful 
water, and soil pollution that undermines their health and 
their quality of life. Even in my own district, about a decade 
ago local residents and first responders became very concerned 
with the increasing number of trains moving hazardous materials 
through their given neighborhoods. Those were oil trains, but 
they were shipped in the same inadequate DOT 111 tank cars.
    Upstate New York has been fortunate to avoid any major 
incidents, but in a different world this hearing could have 
easily been about an Albany situation or one of those many 
other communities that must live with the production, the 
shipment, the storage, or disposal of hazardous materials in 
their backyards. And that is why this tragedy is a stark 
reminder of the critical importance of our Nation's 
environmental laws.
    Over the years, I have heard many claims about these laws 
putting onerous requirements on businesses and stifling 
economic development. But let's be clear. These laws exist for 
a good reason: to protect public health and the environment 
from polluters, polluters that are all too willing to cut 
corners to increase profits and, indeed, avoid responsibility. 
Efforts to erode these laws will only make it harder, harder to 
hold polluters accountable and prevent similar disasters from 
occurring in the first place.
    There can be little doubt that, without EPA's Superfund 
laws, the community and State would still be fighting with the 
company. While this remediation effort will certainly take 
time, it is EPA's oversight and enforcement that will ensure 
that it occurs in a timely and in a responsible manner.
    I know there is much more work to do, and I am fully 
committed to supporting EPA's efforts to hold Norfolk Southern 
accountable and to make the community whole. And I look forward 
to seeing how this subcommittee can indeed contribute to that 
effort.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Tonko follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Tonko. With that, I thank you, Mr. Chair, and I yield 
back.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the chairwoman of the full committee, Cathy McMorris 
Rodgers, for her opening statement.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS, A 
    REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you 
holding this critical hearing. There is no better person than 
you to lead this oversight effort than the people's 
representative for the community of East Palestine, Ohio, and 
the surrounding region. Since the train derailment and chemical 
spill in early February, you have been on the ground alongside 
those you serve. You know their concerns, their worries, and 
their fears. Our top priority is their health and safety.
    As you have said, Chairman Johnson, it is not about scoring 
points or playing political games. The hardworking people of 
Ohio need to be able to trust that their community is a safe 
home to live, raise their families, go to work, and have hope 
for the future. Their livelihoods are on the line. They need to 
be able to trust the environmental and public health protection 
government officials who are a part of the derailment response, 
and that starts with full transparency of what happened with 
this derailment and the extent to which air, water, and soil 
has been contaminated.
    That is our goal today: to gain a complete understanding 
regarding the ongoing Federal, State, and local government 
efforts of this response. To that end, we will hear from EPA 
Regional Administrator Shore this morning. She has been at the 
forefront of the Federal Government's environmental testing and 
response to help the people who work and live in East 
Palestine. We will be seeking answers from the EPA on why it 
has taken some of the actions that it has, what the EPA is 
doing to speed this cleanup along, as well as how this 
committee can help the EPA's efforts to ensure people are 
protected from health or environmental risk.
    A particular concern for our committee is the nexus between 
disposal of excavated contaminated soil, the pace of the 
cleanup, and the risk posed from delays of soil removal and 
proper disposal. I have concerns about actions the States take 
to discriminate against the acceptance of waste and facilities 
built, licensed, and permitted for this exact purpose in cases 
spanning the late 1970s to the early 1990s.
    The Supreme Court declared unconstitutional State and local 
laws that discriminate against waste disposal based upon the 
origin of the waste. I am glad that Administrator Regan 
reminded States on March 17th, 2023, that they cannot put 
restrictions on proper waste disposal that are different from 
the rules in their State. My biggest question with his 
announcement, though, is why was this reminder needed, and what 
took the Agency so long to step in?
    I also want to recognize Director Vogel from the Ohio 
Environmental Protection Agency. We want to learn about how the 
State is working and coordinating with Federal EPA on 
environmental testing and responses to problems under its 
delegated authorities, as well as under State law.
    Finally, I want to express appreciation for Dr. Vins being 
here. As the county's health commissioner, he has been leading 
to address the public health needs and communicate directly 
with the people in the community on the risks faced. As the one 
on this panel who serves in local government, he is the closest 
to the people. Like Chair Johnson, he knows his community well. 
He knows the people, and cares deeply for his friends and 
neighbors. We value the expertise he brings from the county's 
health assessment clinics and the private drinking water well 
sampling activities, and we are eager to learn more about what 
he is observing, and what he believes is critically needed for 
the cleanup.
    I want to emphasize again that we are not here to score 
political points. We are here to get the facts from the 
government agencies on the ground in charge of the response to 
this tragedy. Any efforts to politicize the train derailment 
and chemical spill will hurt our ability to help the people of 
East Palestine. They must be our number-one priority, and they 
need to hear from the officials charged with responding to this 
terrible event that has upended their lives.
    As Chair Johnson and I have both said, this will not be our 
last hearing on this. We also need to hear from Norfolk 
Southern, and we will. Our work will continue for more robust 
oversight with more hearings in the future.
    Again, thank you, Chair Johnson, for the strong leadership 
you are bringing to your district and on this committee. You 
have my support, as well as--as we work together to get full 
transparency and answers on behalf of those you serve. Thank 
you.

    Mr. Johnson. The gentlewoman yields back. The Chair is now 
recognizing the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. 
Pallone, for his opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, Jr., A REPRESENTATIVE 
            IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Chairman Johnson. Today the 
subcommittee is holding a hearing on the Norfolk Southern train 
derailment, but without a representative from the company 
responsible for this disaster and for the cleanup. And I don't 
think it is acceptable that the committee Republicans did not 
invite Norfolk Southern to participate in this hearing. And, 
unfortunately, this omission will result in the American people 
and this committee being deprived of the answers we all deserve 
directly from the company.
    Most of all, the people of East Palestine deserve answers. 
It is certainly good that we are having this hearing today, but 
Norfolk Southern should be here. Norfolk Southern caused this 
mess, and they are tasked with cleaning it up, not the 
Environmental Protection Agency or the Ohio EPA or the 
Columbiana County Health Department. The company should have to 
explain what happened, how they plan to prevent it from 
happening again, and what more must be done to ensure the long-
term health and safety of the community.
    Now, cleaning up a toxic site creates an emotional and 
physical toll for a community. No one should have to fear that 
the water they drink or the air they breathe is unsafe. The 
panelists in front of us today can surely answer many of our 
questions about the response and remediation efforts. But 
Federal, State, and local agencies have largely shifted into 
oversight roles over Norfolk Southern's cleanup activities. 
Norfolk Southern is actually removing the contaminated soil, 
contracting with the waste facilities and hiring the 
contractors to manage the cleanup, and their glaring absence 
holds us back from fully understanding the breadth of this 
catastrophe and the work being done to clean it up. So my hope 
is that the tragedy can offer lessons for future incidents, 
opportunities for legislation to limit further chemical 
disasters, and, most importantly, shine a light on the plight 
of the folks on the ground in East Palestine, Ohio.
    And I don't want my disappointment over Norfolk Southern's 
absence to take away from how pleased I am with the work being 
done by the witnesses who did make the time to come today. I 
think the work between our Federal, State, and local agencies 
is a good example for how to put politics aside for the good of 
our communities facing unforeseen tragedies.
    EPA has been on the ground since the derailment, arriving 
at the site hours after the accident. The agency has provided 
robust air and water testing and opened a community center and 
hotline to share critical information with residents. As a 
long-time supporter of Superfund, I am pleased to see EPA's--
EPA using all of its authority to hold Norfolk Southern 
accountable in every way they can. And I also appreciate their 
work to reassure the residents of East Palestine that the air 
and water are safe, and for the continued oversight over 
Norfolk Southern's cleanup work to ensure the community is made 
whole.
    EPA, Ohio EPA, and local agencies like the Columbiana 
Health Department have been working in tandem to provide 
critical testing data and to dispel misinformation, giving 
residents peace of mind as they navigate this cleanup process.
    The tragic train derailment is a sharp reminder of how 
important it is to have serious, robust environmental laws in 
place to protect communities across the Nation from dangerous 
pollution in the air, water, and soil. Republicans' calls for 
the Federal Government to step in and respond to this disaster 
are proof that the government plays a critical role in 
protecting public health and safety. But rather than join us--
joining us in strengthening the EPA for the future, Republicans 
are attempting to further undermine it. This week, House 
Republicans are proceeding with their what I call polluters-
over-people legislation, H.R. 1, that will tear down 
fundamental environmental and public-health protections that 
protect communities like East Palestine.
    So I will end my opening statement where I began: We must 
finally hear from Norfolk Southern soon, so we can finally get 
answers to important questions that simply cannot be answered 
today. I appreciate that Chair Rodgers said that there will be 
more hearings, and I believe she specifically said that we will 
hear from Norfolk Southern at those future hearings.
    So I appreciate that, Chair Rodgers. Norfolk Southern has 
to be held accountable for this tragedy.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Pallone follows:]
   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Pallone. And with that I yield back the remainder of my 
time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back, and let me 
reiterate the commitment that Chair Rodgers mentioned. We will 
hear from Norfolk Southern at the right time. I would encourage 
all of our Members, though, to go take a look at that rail 
safety bill that we have introduced that is now working its way 
through the T&I Committee process. That will begin to bring 
some relief to other communities, perhaps, around the country.
    Let's go to our witnesses now for their opening statements. 
Again, Honorable Deborah Shore, the Region 5 administrator for 
the EPA.
    Thank you very much for being here. We will now go to you 
for your 5-minutes opening statement.

 STATEMENTS OF DEBRA SHORE, REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR, REGION 5, 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY; ANNE M. VOGEL, DIRECTOR, OHIO 
   ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY; AND WESLEY J. VINS, DPA, 
 HEALTH COMMISSIONER, COLUMBIANA COUNTY (OHIO) GENERAL HEALTH 
                            DISTRICT

                    STATEMENT OF DEBRA SHORE

    Ms. Shore. Good morning, Chair Johnson, Ranking Member 
Tonko, Chair McMorris Rodgers, Ranking Member Pallone, and 
members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me here today 
and for the opportunity to address your questions.
    I want to start by affirming EPA's mission to protect human 
health and the environment so that all communities across 
America have clean air, clean land, and clean water. The health 
and safety of those who have been affected by the Norfolk 
Southern train derailment is a top priority for me and for EPA.
    As soon as EPA was notified of the derailment on February 
3rd, EPA personnel were on site within hours to support our 
partners who were in the lead for the emergency response 
efforts. Every day since, EPA has been boots on the ground, 
working with our Federal, State, and local partners in a 
bipartisan manner to help this community.
    I have been in East Palestine listening to residents and 
have heard how devastating this derailment has been. They are 
understandably worried, and some are scared. And every time a 
train horn blows, they are reminded of the trauma inflicted 
upon them by Norfolk Southern. That is why we have used one of 
EPA's most powerful enforcement tools to hold Norfolk Southern 
accountable and to require the company to clean up the mess it 
made.
    Let me be clear: The residents of the greater East 
Palestine community are not alone. EPA will continue to be with 
them for as long as it takes to ensure their health and safety. 
Working within the Unified Command, EPA has more than 80 
personnel on site.
    Since the derailment, EPA has been leading robust, 
multilayered air quality testing using state-of-the-art 
technology in and around East Palestine. And that extensive 
monitoring has continued daily at 23 stations throughout the 
community. Since the fire was extinguished on February 8th, EPA 
monitors have not detected any volatile organic compounds above 
established levels of health concerns.
    EPA has also been assisting with indoor air screenings in 
homes through a voluntary program to keep residents informed. 
As of March 21st, more than 600 homes have been screened, and 
no sustained or elevated detections of chemicals have been 
identified.
    While EPA is encouraged by the scientific data, we 
recognize that the people of East Palestine may still question 
the health and safety of their community. We have been 
listening to these concerns, and that is why we required 
Norfolk Southern to expand its testing.
    On the water side, EPA is providing support as needed to 
Ohio EPA, the lead for water sampling efforts, in partnership 
with Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, local 
health agencies, and public water systems. EPA has been 
engaging with the community to make sure people get the 
information they need. We opened a community welcome center, 
established a resident phone hotline, participated in several 
town hall meetings, and hosted resource fairs. We also started 
distributing a newsletter to households and businesses to 
preview the work ahead.
    We continue to look for ways to provide information to the 
public. There has been tremendous progress in cleaning up and 
moving the waste out of the community safely and quickly, 
including the removal of more than 9 million gallons of liquid 
waste and over 10,000 tons of soil. And mind you, 70 percent of 
the solid waste shipped off site has occurred in the last 2 
weeks. The pace is picking up, and the job is getting done. 
Nearly half of the total excavation under the train tracks is 
now complete.
    Here is how EPA is holding Norfolk Southern accountable. On 
February 21st, EPA issued a unilateral administrative order to 
Norfolk Southern, including a number of directives to identify 
and clean up contaminated soil and water resources, to attend 
and participate in public meetings at EPA's request, and to 
post information online, and ordering the company to pay EPA's 
costs for work performed under the order. All Norfolk 
Southern's work plans must be reviewed and approved by EPA and 
must outline all steps necessary to address the environmental 
damage caused by the derailment.
    If the company fails to complete any of EPA's ordered 
actions, the agency will immediately step in, conduct the 
necessary work, and then seek punitive damages at up to three 
times the cost.
    Throughout my weeks in East Palestine, I have seen that 
this is a proud and resilient community. East Palestine is 
going to be the greatest comeback story in American history, 
and EPA will be there with them every step of the way.
    Again, thank you for inviting me here today.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Shore follows:]
   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, ma'am.
    And now we will go to the Honorable Anne Vogel, the 
director of Ohio EPA, for your opening comments.

                   STATEMENT OF ANNE M. VOGEL

    Ms. Vogel. Good morning, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member 
Tonko, and members of the committee. Thank you for the 
opportunity to appear before you today to share the State of 
Ohio's work to make sure that East Palestine can get back to 
life as it was before the traumatic days of early February. 
This is a goal that Governor DeWine laid out before the U.S. 
Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee last 
Wednesday.
    It has been more than 6 weeks now since Governor DeWine 
asked me to represent him overseeing Ohio EPA's response to 
East Palestine following the February 3rd train derailment. 
Ohio EPA's priority continues to be overseeing the removal of 
contaminated soil and water from East Palestine. We expect this 
work to continue for at least 2 more months, as the railroad 
removes contaminated soil from under the tracks and works to 
restore the creeks.
    The investigation phase is also underway, which will 
continue to guide long-term remediation plans.
    To be fully protective of human health and the environment 
now and into the future, we are doing the following.
    Testing the municipal water supply on a weekly basis. In 
fact, today we will be taking our eighth round of weekly 
samples. We also test for sentinel wells that are located 
between the contaminated creeks and the municipal well fields, 
and additional sentinel wells are being strategically placed 
around town. Those test results have not shown any 
contamination related to the derailment. We are installing and 
sampling monitoring wells at the site of the derailment, where 
chemicals were spilled, to test for any contamination to 
groundwater.
    Ohio EPA, together with our Federal response partners, have 
been overseeing removal of the soil from beneath the tracks, 
and we do not allow the railroad to rebuild the tracks until we 
confirm through multiple rounds of confirmation sampling that 
contaminated soil has been removed.
    U.S. EPA has brought the most sophisticated technology 
available to continually monitor and ensure that the air we are 
all breathing in East Palestine is safe.
    In direct response to community feedback, we have 
undertaken a robust soil sampling effort. U.S. EPA recently 
announced that soil samples collected at the park in the 
village did not show concerning levels of contamination.
    We are making progress in the removal of chemicals from 
Sulphur Run and Leslie Run. We know those creeks are 
contaminated, but we were encouraged that earlier this month we 
found sensitive aquatic life such as hellbender salamanders 
downstream of the derailment.
    To provide assurance to farmers and to customers of farms 
in the area, the Ohio Department of Agriculture will be testing 
forage crops, grasses, and other agricultural products.
    The Departments of Agriculture and Natural Resources in 
Ohio have found no evidence of any chemical-related deaths in 
any terrestrial animals.
    The steps that we are taking right now to remove the 
contamination from East Palestine are designed to ensure that 
there will be no prolonged chemical exposure to anyone in the 
village.
    A secondary but equally important function of the 
Governor's team in East Palestine is to be a reliable source of 
scientifically verifiable facts and information for the 
community. I am very proud that a large group of experts from 
the Ohio EPA has voluntarily attended a town hall or open house 
every Thursday night for the past month, where we are able to 
talk with people one on one, look at maps, share data, and 
answer their good questions.
    Wes and I attended a meeting in East Palestine High School 
last week to hear the concerns of athletic directors and 
coaches from neighboring schools. They shared that confusion 
about the condition of the air, the water, and the soil in East 
Palestine has presented challenges in getting teams to 
participate in sporting events at East Palestine.
    We also hear concerns from businesses and farmers about 
canceled orders and lost sales. In response to this, we point 
people to the many excellent resources and data available on 
websites such as the Ohio EPA, Ohio EMA, the U.S. EPA, the 
Columbiana County Health Department where you can find current 
testing data, answers to frequently asked questions, and 
regular updates about community events and more.
    One theme of this committee hearing today is transparency. 
As a key function of the State's response to the derailment, I 
can commit to East Palestine that Governor DeWine and his 
cabinet will always tell you exactly what we know, what we 
don't know yet, and what we are doing to find answers for the 
village of East Palestine.
    I thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts today. 
I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Vogel follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you very much. We will now go to Dr. Wes 
Vins for your opening statement.

                STATEMENT OF WESLEY J. VINS, DPA

    Dr. Vins. Congressman Johnson, Vice Chairman Joyce, Ranking 
Member Tonko, and members of the Environment, Manufacturing, 
and Critical Materials Subcommittee, I am Dr. Wesley Vins, and 
I am the health commissioner of the Columbiana County General 
Health District.
    I thank you for the opportunity to speak about the East 
Palestine train derailment on behalf of the residents of 
Columbiana County and the Board of Health. I have served the 
local community for 14 years as health commissioner, and I am 
very familiar with the local perspectives, community concerns, 
and family needs relating to the February 3rd Norfolk Southern 
train derailment.
    Thankfully, the derailed train fire is out and the smoke 
has cleared. But the ongoing concerns for health effects and 
environmental impacts to drinking water remain within the 
community. In addition to requesting their private wells to be 
tested, residents have expressed concerns about immediate 
health issues of sore throats, headaches, and anxiety, as well 
as unknown long-term health conditions, including the 
development of cancer.
    To address some of the most immediate health concerns of 
the residents, our agency has partnered with the Ohio 
Department of Health and the East Liverpool City Hospital to 
establish a health assessment clinic at the well-known First 
Church of Christ near downtown East Palestine that also 
includes a 38-foot mobile clinic unit from the local Federally 
Qualified Health Center. The temporary services include a 
completion of an Assessment of Chemical Exposure, or ACE, 
survey with a registered nurse during a 1-hour evaluation prior 
to a physical exam conducted by a physician. Toxicology and 
stress counseling are also available. To date, 322 residents 
have been evaluated, with some being referred to a primary care 
physician or mental health counselor for followup.
    To respond to the residents' drinking water concerns, 
private wells in the priority areas of East Palestine and south 
along the streams can voluntarily be tested. So far, 
approximately 175 residential wells have been tested in the 
initial round of sampling, with dozens currently being sampled 
a second time to ensure drinking water continues to meet 
standards. The sampling effort is conducted by the local health 
district staff, using an independent laboratory. At the same 
time, the Norfolk Southern contractor also collects a water 
sample for comparison. All water sample results are 
transparently shared with the homeowner.
    As we move forward with the recovery of the residents of 
the East Palestine area, I believe we need to implement some 
key initiatives to protect the community and improve public 
trust.
    The first and most obvious initiative is to improve rail 
safety, which I realize may be outside the scope of this 
committee. But as we see, improved rail safety is necessary to 
protect the public's health across the country and to prevent 
families from experiencing this trauma again. When rail safety 
legislation is presented, I ask that you seriously consider the 
issue by relying on industry experts and good common sense to 
prevent such a disaster from happening to another community.
    The second initiative that I would consider in addition to 
medical reimbursement model would be the establishment of a 
health and wellness center in the village of East Palestine for 
area residents to utilize to address their long-term physical 
health concerns, anxiety, stress, as well as a central location 
for local resources and information. Families that have health 
concerns due to potential or unknown exposures related to the 
February 3rd derailment should have a local medical provider 
made available to them at no cost.
    The final initiative creates a long-term, private well 
sampling program for ensuring safe drinking water at homes in 
the priority areas where municipal water is not available. I am 
requesting that the local health district be funded to operate 
this program with an independent laboratory and local agency 
staff. The deployment of local personnel instead of a corporate 
contractor will provide the highest level of confidence and 
transparency to the community, where maintaining trust in the 
water that families consume on a daily basis is paramount.
    In conclusion, I must recognize that it is a shared 
responsibility of Federal, State, and local government 
officials like you and I to ensure that the residents of East 
Palestine area are not forgotten, overlooked, or minimized, but 
are instead made whole by holding Norfolk Southern accountable 
to make it right. This was not East Palestine's fault.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to present today. I 
would be pleased to answer any questions you may have.

    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T3961.019
    
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you for your opening statements. We will 
now go to Member questions, and the Chair recognizes himself 
for 5 minutes.
    As of last night, according to the--Governor DeWine's 
public East Palestine update, there's still 23,300 tons of 
excavated soil in East Palestine awaiting removal and disposal 
at the proper hazardous waste facilities. Administrator Shore 
and Director Vogel, are the State and Federal EPAs doing 
everything they can to protect residents from potential 
contaminants in the excavated soil during this process?
    Administrator Shore, you can go first.
    Ms. Shore. Thank you, Chairman Johnson. Yes, we are, and 
that is why EPA sent a letter to both Norfolk Southern and to 
State directors of environmental agencies, every single State, 
to remind them, remind Norfolk Southern of its obligation----
    Mr. Johnson. OK.
    Ms. Shore [continuing]. Under the administrative order, to 
find acceptable disposal facilities that have the capacity to 
take the waste, to enter into contracts with them, and to move 
waste off site.
    They have been adding a number of disposal sites----
    Mr. Johnson. Yes.
    Ms. Shore [continuing]. And we understand they are still 
entering into negotiations with others. But----
    Mr. Johnson. OK. There is--the question, though, is 
protecting residents from potential contaminants in the 
excavated soil, the soil that is still sitting there.
    Director Vogel, do you have a----
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman Johnson, thank you for the question.
    The steps that we are taking to protect any soil from 
contaminating the town is--are fairly extensive. These are very 
carefully controlled areas that have been built just to store 
contaminated soil. They are layered carefully. They are 
covered.
    In terms of transport, I know you have been there, you have 
seen the stations. The trucks that roll out are covered 
carefully. The tires are washed. There's street sweepers. We 
are doing everything we can to contain even the water that 
washes the tires of the trucks. We are vacuuming that out and 
storing that water because it is contaminated.
    So, yes, sir, we are doing everything we can.
    Mr. Johnson. OK, all right. Thank you.
    Administrator Shore, your boss, EPA Administrator Regan, 
who--he and I have very frequent conversations, by the way, 
about the issues there--recently sent letters to the States, as 
you mentioned, to remind them that it is unlawful to refuse the 
disposal of out-of-State waste based upon origin.
    Why did the EPA believe it needed to send those letters to 
tell them that they cannot interfere in interstate commerce? 
Because, for instance, in one case trucks were actually turned 
around at the gate of a proper certified disposal facility and 
sent back to East Palestine to sit practically in my 
constituents' back yard. Why did the EPA believe that it needed 
to send those letters?
    Ms. Shore. Chairman Johnson, the instance you cite occurred 
before EPA assumed responsibility for the unilateral--under the 
unilateral administrative order for the cleanup. We don't know 
who told those trucks to turn around, whether it was the 
disposal facility itself or someone else.
    But the reason that Administrator----
    Mr. Johnson. Administrator Shore, I don't mean to interrupt 
you, but I was there when that order was given, and it was a 
couple of weeks later before those trucks were turned around. 
So I am not sure I understand the timing, but that is OK. Go 
ahead with your answer.
    Ms. Shore. Administrator Regan and the agency were 
compelled to send the letters to the States and to Norfolk 
Southern because there was another instance in which Norfolk 
Southern had entered into a contract with a licensed permitted 
disposal facility that was on the approval list for offsite 
disposal of hazardous waste. And the Governor of that State let 
it be known that he had told the company not to accept the 
waste.
    Mr. Johnson. But that was illegal for them to do that under 
the law, right? I mean, that is--we know that.
    So it is my understanding that the EPA issued the order to 
stop shipments of that contaminated soil at the outset of the 
cleanup when the Governor of Michigan raised an objection. Is 
there any statutory authority you can point to that is grounds 
for such an action?
    We know that facility was permitted and equipped to dispose 
of the waste. So who at EPA made the decision to turn the 
trucks around?
    Ms. Shore. Chairman Johnson, no one at EPA issued an order 
to stop shipments, nor did anyone at EPA order that trucks be--
--
    Mr. Johnson. Why were they turned around?
    Ms. Shore. This occurred during the transition period 
between Ohio EPA and U.S. EPA assuming the lead for the 
emergency response. As such, under the unilateral 
administrative order, all disposal facilities are required to 
be on the CERCLA-approved offsite disposal list. So we took--we 
needed a few days to review what had occurred and ensure that 
those facilities that Norfolk Southern had contracts with were 
on that approved list.
    Once we determined which ones were on the approved list, it 
is up to Norfolk Southern to ship waste off the site.
    Mr. Johnson. OK. Well, I have some additional questions. 
Hopefully, my fellow Members will yield me some additional 
time, a little bit. But my time has expired for now.
    I will now turn to our ranking member of the subcommittee, 
Mr. Tonko, for his questions.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, and thank you to each of you for your 
testimony.
    I appreciate that intergovernmental coordination and 
cooperation is never easy, and I am certain we will discover 
ways that events could have been handled more effectively. I 
have no doubt that the agencies before us today will continue 
to work hard to protect the public health of the communities 
affected by the derailment and to hold Norfolk Southern 
accountable.
    Regional Administrator Shore, I would like to try to 
establish some basic facts around the multigovernmental 
response to the derailment so that we have a common 
understanding of what had happened and who was responsible for 
which of the aspects of the response efforts.
    So how soon after the derailment was--were EPA personnel on 
the scene?
    Ms. Shore. I am sorry----
    Mr. Tonko. How soon after the derailment were EPA personnel 
on the scene?
    Ms. Shore. We had several of our on-scene coordinators on 
scene and establishing air monitoring equipment within hours, 
approximately 2:00 a.m. on the morning following the 
derailment.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you. And how soon after the derailment did 
air monitoring begin?
    Ms. Shore. As soon as those personnel were on site they 
began establishing an array of monitors.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you. And what was EPA's role in ensuring 
adequate air monitoring of the area?
    Ms. Shore. It has been EPA's role since the--shortly after 
the derailment, since on-scene coordinators, those--that is 
what we call our emergency responders--arrived on the site, 
both from region 5 and region 3, because this incident affected 
Pennsylvania as well as Ohio.
    Setting up monitors, they have been conducting monitoring 
and expanding the suite of tools that were used to conduct a 
multilayered monitoring and sampling approach and have since 
established 23 sites around the community where we have 
installed a variety of monitors, and then later brought a 
highly sophisticated mobile monitoring bus.
    Mr. Tonko. And how has----
    Ms. Shore. And it has continued 24/7 since we arrived.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you. And how soon after the derailment did 
surface water and groundwater begin to be monitored and sampled 
for potential contamination?
    Ms. Shore. I would defer to Director Vogel, whose agency 
had the lead for the water monitoring piece.
    Mr. Tonko. So what would that response be, Commissioner?
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman Tonko, thank you for your question.
    Surface water began being sampled immediately, because we 
knew that the creeks were contaminated. And the village began 
testing its municipal water on the 8th of February.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you.
    And back to Administrator Shore, can you discuss EPA's role 
in water testing, the role of the agency in water testing?
    Ms. Shore. I am sorry, sir. I am a bit hearing challenged. 
So----
    Mr. Tonko. Oh, can you discuss EPA's role in water testing?
    Ms. Shore. Discuss the EPA's role in water testing? Yes, 
sir.
    We did support Ohio EPA and conduct some surface water 
tests, and also provided support to the Columbiana County 
Health District in its role in testing private well waters, as 
requested.
    Mr. Tonko. And when did EPA begin to use its Superfund 
authority to compel Norfolk Southern to remediate the given 
site?
    Ms. Shore. EPA issued the unilateral administrative order 
under CERCLA on February 21st. It went into effect on February 
27th.
    Mr. Tonko. And I--am I right in stating that the 
company's--the remediation is happening at the company's 
expense?
    Ms. Shore. Yes.
    Mr. Tonko. And can you discuss EPA's role in overseeing and 
approving the company's work plan?
    Ms. Shore. So under the Unified Command, which was 
established as a result of the unilateral order, Norfolk 
Southern has been required to submit extensive and 
comprehensive work plans, portions of which have already been 
approved for soil sampling, for instance, and the rest is being 
reviewed by the representatives of local, State, and other 
Federal agencies that comprise the Unified Command. And Norfolk 
Southern is being compelled to follow those work plans under 
the oversight of EPA.
    Mr. Tonko. And then finally, if Director Vogel and 
Commissioner Vins could respond to the question as though--as 
if you have received the assistance you require from U.S. EPA 
to carry out your responsibilities.
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman Tonko, yes, I believe we have been 
very happy with the--our response partners on the Federal 
level. Thank you.
    Mr. Tonko. And Commissioner?
    Dr. Vins. Yes, thank you for the question, Representative. 
Yes, we have been pleased. We received--in fact, today--support 
from the U.S. EPA in our private water sampling program with 
teams in the field.
    Mr. Tonko. That is terrific.
    With that, I yield back, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the chairwoman of the full committee, Cathy McMorris 
Rodgers, for her questions.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And to all our 
witnesses, thank you for being here, and for your attention and 
response to this tragedy.
    I wanted to focus on risk communication, which is so 
important in an emergency. In 2013 a National Academies of 
Science manual stated, ``It is important that communication 
strategies include plans to collect information that might 
reduce uncertainties, or plans to revisit the decision once 
more data are gathered.'' The National Academies specifically 
emphasized reporting uncertainties when fright factors are 
involved or intended audience distrust--outcomes that suggest 
low risk, but the public is convinced the risks are serious.
    So to all of you, I just would like to ask you a few 
questions. When it comes to the environment or the health risk 
posed by air, water, and soil contamination in East Palestine, 
how much scientific uncertainty exists where people should not 
draw conclusions about the results just yet?
    And we will start with Administrator Shore, and work 
across.
    Ms. Shore. Chairman McMorris Rodgers, science is our 
agency's lodestar, and we base our work and decisions on the 
data we have and on the best scientific knowledge available to 
us at the time.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Would--are you able to speak to the 
uncertainty that may exist today regarding some of the 
conclusions that have been drawn about the chemicals that were 
spilled in this tragedy?
    Ms. Shore. We have, in the air monitoring realm, relied on 
a multilayered approach of sophisticated equipment that has 
both sampling and monitoring, including a--what is called a 
TAGA bus, a Trace Atmospheric Gas Analyzer bus, that can take 
samples, analyze them in real time, and that has for 10 hours a 
day been circling the community and, more particularly, the 
worksite. Based on the data we have, we have seen no sustained 
elevated levels of any compound that would have--be of health 
concerns.
    I understand that people are concerned. And that is why, if 
they have concerns about their own health, we urge them to 
seek, as Dr. Vins described, to go to the clinic or consult 
with their primary healthcare provider.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK, thank you.
    Director Vogel?
    Ms. Vogel. Chairwoman, thank you for the question.
    I can't speak to the level of uncertainty out there. I can 
tell you how we address uncertainty. What we continue to do is 
test on a regular basis. It is the reason for the sentinel 
wells and the monitoring wells, so that when--first of all, we 
are transparent in all of our test results. They are all 
published on the website in all their gory detail, right, every 
tick, everything is there. And so if we do find something, that 
will inform the next step.
    So it is a very carefully phased approach where, again, as 
Administrator Shore says, we are following the science so that 
if we do find anything, we will know it, we will know it before 
it is a public health concern, and we will be able to address 
it accordingly.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK, thank you.
    Dr. Vins?
    Dr. Vins. Yes, thank you for the question, Chairwoman. As 
far as--our agency is--we are very fortunate. Technically in my 
agency we are very strong. We are a small agency of only 17, 
but technically, I feel, we are very, very strong. But we are 
not experts. And so we rely heavily on experts in any industry 
and any field when it comes to water quality, certainly air 
monitoring, and stream monitoring. We have some of our local--
our experts here that we rely on.
    When it comes to healthcare, we rely on our partners, as we 
have talked about, with the health assessment clinic that we 
have got. We have online a direct line to the toxicologist at 
the Poison Control Center. So those experts are what really 
help us address that uncertainty. But to take that information 
and communicate that directly to the resident is the most 
important part.
    We find that we are most effective one-on-one with the 
resident. Certainly, we have got the ability to do press 
releases and we, you know, exercised that a lot during our 
recent pandemic. However, we find that the--in this instance, 
to have that conversation one-on-one with the resident is most 
important. So gain good information from an expert, and then 
actually have a conversation to translate that. Use our 
technical folks, use our partners, use Poison Control, use 
physicians, translate that information into a usable form so 
that the resident has a higher level of confidence.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Is there----
    Dr. Vins. That helps to reduce the uncertainty.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you. Is there anything that we could 
have done better, or more data that we need in this situation?
    To each of you.
    Dr. Vins. I guess I will respond to that and say it is very 
important to continue the ongoing monitoring. I think more 
information and ongoing information--things change. Certainly, 
when we talk about groundwater, we talk about activities at the 
site, to continue to monitor the air, to continue to monitor 
groundwater, to continue to monitor the streams, these are all 
very, very important issues, as well as monitoring our health 
of the residents going forward. So I think monitoring is the 
key.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK, thank you. My time has expired, and I 
will yield back.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Johnson. The chairwoman yields back, and the Chair now 
recognizes the gentlelady from Colorado, Ms. DeGette, for 5 
minutes.
    Ms. DeGette. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and I am 
really happy the witnesses are here today to give us an update 
onto the--into the ongoing remediation. And I am also pleased, 
Mr. Chairman, that you have announced that you are going to 
have an additional hearing with Norfolk Southern, because I 
think it is really going to be important to hear the second 
half of the story.
    But one thing I have been thinking about--I represent an 
urban community of Denver, and in Denver and around the area we 
have had a number of environmental contamination events. And 
people don't really think about the need for rapid response and 
for quick action and effective action until there is an 
emergency like this. Then they are really happy--they think, 
oh, what is the EPA--but then, when this happens, they are 
really happy to see there is an agency with the expertise and 
ability to come in and do a quick turnaround.
    And so we have heard from everybody about the robust, swift 
response that we have been having. What I want to ask about is, 
now that we are--and I think, Administrator Shore, you have 
talked about how, just in the last few weeks, you have been 
really ramping up the efforts. But what I am wondering is what 
type of long-term monitoring is EPA going to put in place to 
ensure that there is continued health of the environment in 
East Palestine?
    Ms. Shore. Thank you, Congresswoman. And as you noted, our 
focus at the moment is to compel Norfolk Southern to do the job 
of cleaning up the mess it made. The best way to reduce any 
long-term effects is to get the waste moved off of the site and 
into safe liquid and solid disposal sites. Then there will be 
far less long-term exposure.
    However, it is EPA's role and mission to protect public 
health and the environment. And we can establish long-term air, 
water, and soil monitoring programs to continue looking at the 
remediation and the results for years to come. We have done 
that in other sites. We will do that in East Palestine and the 
surrounding community.
    Ms. DeGette. So that is your intention, once you deal with 
the immediate crisis, to then put that kind of a plan into 
place?
    Ms. Shore. It is.
    Ms. DeGette. Now, is it--is the EPA intending to use the 
unilateral administrative order to ensure that Norfolk Southern 
establishes a health and environmental screening program beyond 
this initial cleanup period?
    Ms. Shore. Right now the focus of the unilateral order and 
our work with Norfolk Southern is to make sure the site is 
cleaned up.
    I think the responsibility for that longer-term health 
effort--I support what Dr. Vins recommended, and that may have 
to be negotiations with Norfolk Southern going forward.
    Ms. DeGette. Obviously, that hasn't started yet.
    Ms. Shore. Not to my knowledge.
    Ms. DeGette. OK. Do you have any idea what the--well, I am 
sure you do. Can you tell me what the authorities that the EPA 
has to require Norfolk Southern to continue to provide to the 
community after this initial cleanup?
    Ms. Shore. The order does give EPA the authority to compel 
Norfolk Southern to pay for and conduct all the necessary 
cleanup activities for soil, water, and so forth, and that will 
endure until we are sure that it is cleaned up.
    Ms. DeGette. So just beyond these initial efforts.
    Ms. Shore. I don't know the answer to that.
    Ms. DeGette. OK. Do you have all the tools that you need 
from Congress to properly and effectively respond to this 
crisis?
    Ms. Shore. Thanks for that question. I certainly would urge 
Congress to support the agency's budget proposal, because that 
gives us the resources we need to provide the kind of emergency 
response that you noted is so welcome in urban and suburban and 
rural communities across the Nation.
    Ms. DeGette. Great, thank you.
    Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentlewoman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Carter, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And before I begin, 
let me thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your outstanding work in 
representing your constituents during this time. We have all 
been in awe of your constant attention to this, and appreciate 
it. And I am sure the people of East Palestine appreciate it 
even more.
    You know--and thank you all. Thank you all for what you all 
are doing. This is extremely important, extremely important to 
these people. This community has been devastated by this. I can 
only imagine what they are going through.
    I know in my district in south Georgia, I had--I represent 
the entire coast of Georgia, and we have four Superfund sites 
in our--in one county, as a matter of fact. And I know how it 
can have such a devastating impact on a county.
    And help me out here, Administrator Shore, just--and dumb 
it down for me, if you will. If it is a Superfund site--how are 
they going to decide whether it is going to be a Superfund site 
or not? Will it be a certain area? Will it be--you know, does--
because, as I understand it, they are not going to be able to 
live in that area if it is deemed to be that, is it?
    Ms. Shore. The authority that was granted to the agency 
under CERCLA for emergency response and removal, we think, is 
sufficient to compel Norfolk Southern to pay for everything and 
to get the cleanup done without it being added to the national 
priority list.
    Mr. Carter. OK. Well, I am glad to know that because--and I 
hope you are right, I hope that does come to fruition and 
happens, because I will tell you these Superfund sites that I 
have had in my district have been that way for decades. I mean, 
they are still not resolved. And, you know, and some of them 
are prime areas that need to be developed, if we could, and, 
you know, prime commercial areas. So it does have a big impact. 
And I think you all--I see nodding of heads. I hope that means 
you recognize that.
    Help me out, Administrator Shore. As I understand it, you 
all have moved from the emergency response now to the 
remediation process, and--or remediation phase, I should say. 
So what did the EPA do during the emergency process, the 
emergency response?
    Ms. Shore. EPA's role has been severalfold, but immediately 
was to conduct the air monitoring, which we established within 
hours after the derailment and have continued to do with 
personnel on the ground, taking samples and using monitors in a 
multilayered, redundant approach.
    But also, under the unilateral administrative order, EPA 
sits at the top of the Unified Command, coordinating the 
response, coordinating the cleanup, and compelling Norfolk 
Southern to follow the work plan that it has submitted.
    Mr. Carter. OK, so now you are moving to the remediation 
phase, is that correct?
    Ms. Shore. It will lead to that. But we really--I view it 
as still in the removal phase, because we have to get that 
contaminated soil and the contaminated water resulting from the 
derailment----
    Mr. Carter. Right.
    Ms. Shore [continuing]. To safe disposal sites.
    Mr. Carter. And then what will take place in the 
remediation phase? What happens then?
    Ms. Shore. Then there will be restoration of stream banks 
and the places where the soil was removed from along the 
railroad sites, and I think a larger vision for the community 
that they are already beginning to work on, such as parks and 
streetscapes----
    Mr. Carter. Right.
    Ms. Shore [continuing]. And so forth.
    Mr. Carter. Any idea of what kind of timeframe we are 
talking about here?
    Ms. Shore. Well----
    Mr. Carter. I mean, are we talking, like, in my district, 
decades?
    Ms. Shore. No. The--we believe the core of the removal of 
the contaminated site and the restoration of the tracks will be 
several months.
    Mr. Carter. OK. The chairman mentioned in his opening 
statement--and I think it is extremely important--the 
importance of communication. And I hope that we will all keep 
that in mind, how important that is. God bless these people for 
what they are going through and having to go through by no 
blame of their own.
    And I want to make sure that we all understand how 
important the communication is. Regardless of whether the news 
is good or bad, we need to know. And it needs to be truthful. 
You need to tell them, and straight up, what is happening, what 
is going to happen, what has got to happen. That is going to be 
extremely important.
    So thank you again. Thank you all. This is not an easy 
situation, but it is a situation where we really need to have 
some responsible people in charge. So thank you.
    And I will yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the ranking member from New Jersey, Mr. Pallone, for 
5 minutes.
    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and let me thank our 
panelists again.
    I appreciate your tireless work on the ground in East 
Palestine to swiftly get this community back to normal. And I 
appreciate your insights regarding the ongoing response and 
cleanup efforts.
    Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, we are not getting 
the full story on the train derailment and cleanup because the 
majority did not invite the responsible party, Norfolk 
Southern. I had a lot of questions for them, but I will have to 
save my questions for when they appear in the future before the 
committee.
    I wanted to say, as a longtime Superfund advocate, I am 
pleased to see EPA use its CERCLA authorities to immediately 
hold Norfolk Southern accountable and to start the cleanup 
ahead of the unilateral administrative order to the company.
    So let me ask the Regional Administrator Shore, when did 
cleanup responsibility shift from EPA to Norfolk Southern, and 
what protections were put in place to ensure health and safety 
of the community during that shift?
    Ms. Shore. Thank you, Congressman Pallone. This--the 
transition from the State agency, which has the delegated 
authority in every State, has an emergency response capability. 
And so Ohio was on the ground, working with the local firemen 
and other agencies as EPA arrived shortly after the derailment.
    It is typical in these kind of emergency responses for the 
State agency to take the lead in the early days. And Norfolk 
Southern was complying with the directives from the State. They 
continue to comply, but have we found over time that it is 
important to have all the authority to hold the principal 
responsible party--in this case Norfolk Southern--accountable, 
which is why, on February 21st, several weeks after the 
derailment, EPA issued its unilateral administrative order.
    And you may have seen a press conference where 
Administrator Regan, announcing that, was joined by Governor 
DeWine and Governor Shapiro, by Congressman Johnson and 
Congressman Deluzio, and by other officials from both States 
and both parties in a unified effort to demonstrate that we are 
working together without cease to try to protect and restore 
the people of East Palestine and the community.
    Mr. Pallone. Now, let me ask you again. I--because I want 
to get to Mr. Vogel.
    Looking further down the road, if additional contamination 
is found after cleanup is complete, will Norfolk Southern be 
held legally responsible?
    Briefly, if you could, answer that.
    Ms. Shore. Yes.
    Mr. Pallone. All right. And then let me--thank you.
    Director Vogel, in your testimony you state that EPA has 
brought in state-of-the-art air monitoring technology to East 
Palestine to help reassure the community in their--that their 
air is safe. Is it fair to say that EPA and their technical 
assistance have been very helpful to you during this cleanup 
process?
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman, thank you for the question.
    Yes, unquestionably, the air monitoring has been critical, 
going back to the early days of this incident. And I would also 
say the big bat, right, of the CERCLA order has been extremely 
valuable to our cleanup efforts.
    Mr. Pallone. Thank you. Now, let me just go back to 
Regional Administrator Shore.
    Last question: How would you characterize the working 
relationship between the agencies in Unified Command?
    Ms. Shore. I would characterize it as working well 
together. Certainly, some of the representatives have strong 
opinions, as they are entitled to, but the Unified Command 
provides a platform for sharing data, for sharing opinions, for 
reviewing work plans, for reaching a common and agreed-upon 
approach to solving this.
    Mr. Pallone. Well, thank you. I just want to say I am 
encouraged to see the EPA, Ohio EPA, and the Columbiana County 
General Health District working together to share real-time 
information with the community to dispel misinformation and 
provide critical services.
    There is no question the residents of East Palestine 
deserve swift action, and they also deserve answers from 
Norfolk Southern, and they deserve a Congress ready and engaged 
to hold all parties accountable. So I look forward to 
continuing this conversation and future hearings with Norfolk 
Southern present. And I know that, as I said before, that Chair 
Rodgers has made that commitment.
    So thank you, Chairman Johnson, and thank you again, the 
witnesses.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the vice chairman of the Environment, Manufacturing, 
and Critical Materials Subcommittee, Dr. Joyce, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Chairman Johnson, for holding this 
hearing. I want to acknowledge your leadership that you have 
shown in face of this crisis in Ohio. It resonates throughout 
this committee, and it resonates throughout Congress. Thank 
you, sir.
    My district also is no stranger to the rail industry. 
Numerous towns were founded and grew up around railroad 
stations and repair shops. My own hometown of Altoona owes its 
creation to the Pennsylvania Railroad. Both of my grandfathers 
worked for the railroad. My wife's grandmother worked for the 
railroad. Realize that railroading is an integral part of the 
DNA of many of my constituents.
    The rails right now, they run past churches, they run past 
schools, soccer and baseball fields, and many homes. For many 
small towns--not just my own--for many small towns within 
Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district, this rail accident 
is a sum of many fears: 11 of the 12 counties that I represent 
have significant rail traffic that transport the same chemicals 
that were leaked and burned in the derailment in East 
Palestine. My constituents are not just concerned about what 
has happened, but they are worried about what could happen. 
They need to know that the railroads are operating safely. They 
need to know that, should the worst happen, the Federal 
Government, and specifically the EPA, will prioritize their 
well-being over everything else.
    Residents on both sides of the Ohio and Pennsylvania border 
have been repeatedly told that their air is safe to breathe and 
that their water is safe to drink. As I talk to my 
constituents, there is a perception that there was a rush to 
judgment to determine that chemical levels were safe. I am 
concerned that our environmental protection agencies have lost 
credibility in many of these communities.
    My first question is for Administrator Shore.
    Can you please explain how the U.S. EPA, the OEPA, and the 
Columbiana County reached this conclusion for the air and water 
quality?
    Ms. Shore. Thank you, Congressman Joyce. EPA's on-scene 
coordinators, once they learned which chemicals and 
constituents were on the train and had spilled as part of the 
derailment, consulted with our toxicologists and 
representatives from the CDC and ATSDR to identify those 
chemicals of greatest concern, and made those the focus of our 
initial monitoring efforts.
    We continue to consult with health agencies about screening 
levels and adjusted our monitoring accordingly as the response 
continued. But EPA has deployed a comprehensive network of 
tools to monitor the air quality and to understand as much as 
we can about potential risks, so we can reduce those risks and 
protect the health of community members.
    Now we have collected hundreds of laboratory-analyzed air 
samples that show levels of a wide range of chemicals have 
remained below screening levels in the community since the 
derailment.
    Mr. Joyce. Administrator Shore, even though the EPA's 
district 5 does not include Pennsylvania, can you speak to how 
EPA assessed the inhalation risk that these chemical mixtures 
posed to people who are downwind in the State of Pennsylvania?
    Ms. Shore. Yes, Congressman, excellent question. Region 3 
is the region that includes Pennsylvania, and region 3 also had 
on-scene coordinators on the scene within hours after the 
derailment. We--in the subsequent soil sampling that is being 
conducted, we looked at the information about the direction of 
the plume from the vent-and-burn event and focused that 
primarily where there might have been aerial deposition of soot 
or particulate matter. And that is--those soil samples have 
been collected in Pennsylvania----
    Mr. Joyce. And today, what soil, air, and water tests are 
continuing to occur in Pennsylvania?
    Ms. Shore. Additional soil samples will be collected, in 
collaboration, principally, with the Pennsylvania Department of 
Agriculture, the local Farm Bureau, and the Pennsylvania 
Department of Environmental Protection.
    Mr. Joyce. And I think that is so important, with 
agriculture being such a large component of Pennsylvania's 
industry.
    How long into the State is this testing going to continue?
    Ms. Shore. Long in time duration----
    Mr. Joyce. In duration.
    Ms. Shore [continuing]. Or distance?
    Mr. Joyce. Yes.
    Ms. Shore. Oh----
    Mr. Joyce. Well, I will take both. Let's talk about the 
radius and distance, and let's talk about time duration.
    Ms. Shore. EPA has conducted--or directed Norfolk Southern 
to conduct tests in the area where it was principally 
determined there might be deposition. But if others wish to 
have soil tested, call us. We will work with them.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you. I appreciate you being here. And 
again, I thank the chairman for holding this.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentlelady from Illinois, Ms. Schakowsky, for 5 
minutes.
    Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to 
begin by saying I think you hear from this committee that all 
of us on both sides of the aisle are totally committed to 
working with you and helping you address the crisis in your 
community, which could have happened in any one of our 
communities. And I do want to thank you for beginning this 
hearing with recognizing the dedication of the representatives 
of the Environmental Protection Agency.
    And as a moment of personal privilege, let me just say 
about my long-time and dear friend Debra Shore, who has really 
dedicated her entire life well before this to environmental 
protection, for about 15 years she was on the board of the 
Metropolitan Water Reclamation District and transformed that 
agency in Cook County into really an environmental organization 
protecting our water, our great lake.
    And I agree with you that the work of the EPA getting on 
the ground within hours was really an example of the work that 
they can do, and that they are still there and have been there 
the whole time. And I know that Administrator Shore was 
personally there for 14 days on the ground, and representatives 
are still there. And I know the local EPA, the State EPA, has 
also been there.
    But I do want to--and with all due respect to the 
chairman--express my frustration that Norfolk Southern is not 
here. And I do look forward to seeing them. As the responsible 
party, the one that is responsible for the cleanup, we do need 
to really understand exactly what they have done, what they are 
going to be doing as quickly as possible. You talked about, 
down the road, legislation. But frankly, we have to have 
immediate answers.
    So what I--I have a question for our region 5 
administrator. So I want to know what the EPA has done not only 
for the community. I mean, not only for the things that you 
have said that have been done, but what kinds of things have 
you done directly for the community to make sure that they are 
being informed, and engaged, and involvement--involved, and 
notified?
    Ms. Shore. Thanks, Congressman Schakowsky. I never thought 
I would be here at a committee hearing speaking to my own 
congresswoman.
    EPA has been involved with the community in a number of 
ways. I first met Chairman Johnson at a town--the first town 
hall meeting about--less than 2 weeks after the derailment, 
where I and then representatives from our agency were there to 
answer questions and explain to the community how our equipment 
worked, and so on.
    And I have been at subsequent town meetings and community 
meetings. I have met with local business leaders. We opened a 
welcome center in town, where more than 400 people have stopped 
by to have their questions answered. As noted, we have just 
started sending out--this is the second week of a newsletter 
mailed to 5,000 residences and businesses in Ohio and 
Pennsylvania and dropped at the library and the banks and 
Circle K and other places for people to pick this up, which 
includes top questions of the week, as well as information 
about the work plan, what can people in the community expect to 
happen, and who to call if they have questions----
    Ms. Schakowsky. Let me ask one final thing. I know that you 
testified before the Senate, and you mentioned here this 
morning--tell me what you need for the Environmental Protection 
Agency to be able to do its job. You mentioned about the 
budget. So if you could, just conclude with that.
    Ms. Shore. Well, the budget includes not only the resources 
we need for our emergency responders and for cleanup work but 
for the water and wastewater infrastructure needs that are seen 
throughout the Nation, both rural and urban, and the 
congressionally directed spending that we wish to implement and 
oversee.
    So it really helps the agency do its aspirational and 
important mission of protecting public health and the 
environment.
    Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you so much for your service. I 
appreciate it.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes my colleague from Ohio, Mr. Balderson, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Balderson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all 
for being here today.
    I also want to thank Chairman Johnson for holding this 
important hearing and for the work he has done on the ground in 
Ohio to help his constituents after the aftermath of this 
disaster. Since the disaster occurred on February 3rd, 
Congressman Johnson has been a tireless advocate. I have even 
called to check on him a couple of times, and he is hanging 
right in there. And he was there every day, nonstop.
    And I was proud to partner with him when he introduced the 
Bipartisan RAIL Act, which provides meaningful reforms to rail 
safety. And I encourage my colleagues to support the chairman's 
legislation.
    I also want to say congrats, but also for the phenomenal 
job that--it is hard to even say this--Director Vogel has done 
as the new director of the Ohio EPA, and something that, as a 
friend, that you have--it is an honor to watch you and what you 
have done. And that is--my first question is to you, Director.
    Do you believe that this derailment has caused any threats 
to human health in the communities' treating--treated drinking 
water?
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman Balderson, thank you for the 
question. If I can show my visual aid that I used with the 
community, I would like to.
    I want to acknowledge that this has been, obviously, a 
traumatic event for the community. And what we are doing is 
everything we can, as Ms. Shore said, to remove any 
contamination so it never does. But we will keep testing.
    [Chart shown.]
    Ms. Vogel. And I want to say that the reason that we have 
been able to say that the municipal drinking water is safe is 
based on an Ohio EPA map that pre-exists the derailment. This 
is the source water protection map. So the municipal well field 
is right here, if folks can see that, that big well in the 
blue. So the derailment happened way over here, a mile and a 
half away from the well field. And we know how the water flows 
down this way, down this way, down the creeks. So it--the 
derailment would not have affected the municipal water source, 
and we knew that very quickly after the derailment.
    So thank you for letting me bring my visual aid. And, you 
know--I want to be clear, though, that we are not going to stop 
testing to make sure that there will be no effects in the long 
term.
    Mr. Balderson. OK. Thank you, Director.
    Administrator Shore, do you and the U.S. EPA agree with 
what Director Vogel just presented?
    Ms. Shore. Congressman, I do. I wish I had been able to 
bring a bottle of East Palestine municipal water with me today, 
because I drink it whenever I am there.
    Mr. Balderson. OK, thank you.
    Dr. Vins, it was a pleasure to meet you this morning. Are 
the testing results of the private wells in alignment with the 
results from the water systems?
    Dr. Vins. Yes, they are. Thank you for the question.
    Mr. Balderson. OK. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, Ohio 
EPA has primary Federal enforcement responsibility for treated 
drinking water standards. Director Vogel, how many community 
water systems serve the affected community?
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman, there is the municipal well field, 
which has five wells providing--to the village drinking water 
treatment plant. There is one well at the State Line Tavern 
that is also a public water system.
    Mr. Balderson. OK. How many community water systems serve--
is there more than one source of drinking water used? Is 
there----
    Ms. Vogel. It is just wells----
    Mr. Balderson. Just wells?
    Ms. Vogel. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Balderson. All right. Has the Ohio EPA tested all 
relevant sources for contamination?
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman, we have tested the raw water and 
the finished water.
    Mr. Balderson. Could you please provide the results of 
those tests for the record?
    Ms. Vogel. We can, and they are also posted on Ohio EPA's 
website.
    Mr. Balderson. Perfect, thank you. What specifically are 
you testing for, Director?
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman, we are testing for a--we took a 
very broad approach to testing municipal water. It is about 190 
compounds, volatile organic compounds, semivolatile. Also, 
any--of course, the compounds of concern from the derailment. 
It is a very long list, and again, it is--all of that is on the 
website.
    Mr. Balderson. OK, I appreciate it. And again, thank you 
for your great work and coming into something like that very 
quickly.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back my remaining time.
    Mr. Johnson. Will the gentleman yield?
    Mr. Balderson. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Johnson. A couple of quick questions--I will take 
advantage of my colleague's remaining time. This may, in fact, 
be the most important question that I will ask today.
    A lot has been said in the last month about how dedicated 
everyone is to cleaning up East Palestine and helping its 
residents. Moving the dirt pile is the concern now, but we all 
know this isn't over. So, Administrator Shore, can you state 
for the record in this committee, do you concur with 
Administrator Regan that, even after the cameras turn off and 
the news cycle moves on, when said--when he said the EPA will 
be working to make things right in this community ``for the 
long haul,'' or--do you agree with that, you are going to 
continue to work to make things right?
    Ms. Shore. Yes, Congressman Johnson.
    Mr. Johnson. What does the long-haul finished job look like 
to you? What does that mean?
    Ms. Shore. It means a variety of things. We will establish 
a long-term monitoring plan for soils throughout the community, 
for water systems, surface water streams, and continue doing 
air monitoring as warranted.
    I personally expect to be visiting East Palestine and 
picnicking, instead of having press conferences with neighbors 
and residents, for months and possibly years to come.
    Mr. Johnson. I thank you for that. I yield back to Mr. 
Balderson.
    You--the gentleman yields. The Chair now recognizes the 
gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I 
appreciate you setting a substantive tone for the hearing at 
the outset. I want to thank our witnesses for being here.
    As we have all been saying, the health and environmental 
consequences that have been visited upon the East Palestine 
community are inexcusable. Norfolk Southern must be held 
accountable for causing the incident, and I know that ongoing 
inquiry into accountability is going to continue.
    When polluters are jeopardizing our safety and harmful 
incidents like this occur, we turn to the EPA and we turn to 
State and local partners for protection and remediation. And I 
wholeheartedly believe Americans deserve to be safeguarded from 
hazardous chemicals. And when contamination occurs, we have to 
have access to thorough and expedient cleanup opportunities.
    I do have to make the observation that there is on the 
floor this week a bill from our Republican colleagues, their 
H.R. 1 bill, which would actually limit some of EPA's 
regulatory authorities like the ones that are being used right 
now to ensure proper handling of the disaster. And it is wrong 
to put the interests of polluters over the safety and security 
of communities across the country.
    In East Palestine, EPA deployed within hours, as you have 
described, to provide on-site support of State and local 
responders, including monitoring the air and water quality so 
critical. EPA has also exercised its authorities to oversee 
Norfolk Southern's cleanup obligations. We appreciate that.
    As part of its EPA-mandated cleanup activity, Norfolk 
Southern contracted with an industrial wastewater treatment 
company in Baltimore, where I am from, to process liquid 
wastewater from the derailment. It was initially announced that 
this treated wastewater would then be discharged through the 
Back River Wastewater Treatment Plant, which, for those who are 
not aware, has had its own significant challenges recently, 
some of which have required Maryland's Department of the 
Environment to intercede.
    While it seems based on an announcement just this morning 
from that Baltimore company that the wastewater might 
ultimately be treated elsewhere, this is kind of an evolving 
story. We are still working with others in the Federal, State, 
and local delegation to get the specifics of that new plan. And 
regardless of where the wastewater is ultimately treated, I am 
very concerned about making sure--and I am sure you can 
understand this--that these efforts do not jeopardize the 
health and safety of Marylanders, Chesapeake Bay, or other 
communities.
    Since Norfolk Southern is missing from this hearing today, 
I can't ask them directly how they intend to ensure that this 
wastewater treatment will not pose a threat to the communities 
and environments it is discharged in. So instead I will ask 
you, Administrator Shore. How exactly will EPA ensure that this 
remediation will not impact the health, safety, and security of 
the communities where the remediation will take place?
    In other words, you have spoken a lot about what is 
happening in East Palestine, but could you speak a little bit 
about this issue of where the discharge is going for treatment?
    Ms. Shore. Thank you, Congressman Sarbanes, and I certainly 
respect and appreciate your concern and care for your 
constituents. I encourage, as Congressman Johnson did, everyone 
to extend that care and concern to the people in East Palestine 
and the surrounding communities.
    EPA has a list of disposal sites that can accept solid or 
liquid waste--hazardous waste--and they must apply to be on 
that list, and EPA conducts a thorough review of their capacity 
and treatment processes. And only when they have passed this 
rigorous application and review are they added to the CERCLA 
list of approved facilities for offsite disposal. We have made 
that list available in Norfolk Southern, and they are now 
required--and have been since the start of this emergency 
response, but certainly under the unilateral administrative 
order--to identify and enter into contracts only with disposal 
sites that meet those rigorous standards.
    And we have additional safeguards, as Director Vogel 
mentioned, during the loading, the transport, and the unloading 
of hazardous wastes.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Thank you very much.
    And I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Weber, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Weber. Thank you, Chairman.
    Director Vogel, the status of the pile of excavated waste 
is a major concern. You have heard that, and it is nothing new. 
What precautions are being taken to prevent blowing or drifting 
of contaminated soils from that pile into the community?
    And how long should we expect to have to kind of monitor 
that?
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman, thank you for your question. The 
piles are managed by professionals. They were careful--they 
were built, they were designed to hold the contaminated soil. 
They are--I know Congressman Johnson has been out there--they 
are lined, and they are covered in layers, and carefully 
compacted to make sure that there isn't drifting or blowing.
    Mr. Weber. Do they----
    Ms. Vogel. How long----
    Mr. Weber. Go ahead.
    Ms. Vogel. It may take several more months to get all of 
the soil out.
    Mr. Weber. So when they transport that contaminated soil, 
closed container, a container with some kind of lid on it, or 
do you know?
    Ms. Vogel. Yes, Congressman. They--it is being trucked out 
of East Palestine, so loaded and trucked. The trucks go through 
a wash station that--it is inspected to make sure that it is 
covered completely and sealed. And then the tires are washed to 
make sure that no contaminated soil is getting onto the roads.
    Mr. Weber. And I know this is way down in the weeds--or 
maybe way down in the drainage system, however you want to look 
at it--but when they wash those tires and wheels, is that water 
captured and treated or checked?
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman, yes. Yes, sir, it is. It is in a 
pad, and so that water is vacuumed and stored in those blue 
frack tanks.
    Mr. Weber. OK.
    Ms. Vogel. For disposal.
    Mr. Weber. Well, I am glad to hear the term ``tanks,'' 
because I have seen a lot of 18-wheelers on the highway. Some 
of them have a cover like a tarp, but I am holding that this is 
a completely--hoping this is a completely enclosed tank.
    Ms. Vogel. For the liquids? It is tanks.
    Mr. Weber. Well, and dirt too, for that matter.
    Ms. Vogel. The soil is in trucks that are covered and 
sealed.
    Mr. Weber. OK. And I think she might have answered this 
earlier. What steps are being taken to keep the community safe 
as contaminated soil is excavated?
    I guess the really question--the real question there is, is 
there an air monitoring process? If there is an accident, is 
there a system set up to notify everybody?
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman, I would defer to U.S. EPA. But as 
Administrator Shore has explained, the TAGA bus, that real-time 
air monitoring bus, drives a route around----
    Mr. Weber. OK. Well, I apologize. I was in another 
committee hearing----
    Ms. Vogel. No--yes, I am happy----
    Mr. Weber. Yes.
    Ms. Vogel [continuing]. To talk about it again. And as far 
as notifying people if there are any detections, we haven't had 
any health-concerning detections. However, there is a process 
in place. I believe whenever there is a--any sort of concern, 
the work would be stopped immediately would be the plan.
    Mr. Weber. And Administrator Shore, I go to you. 
Contaminated from air deposition has been an issue of concern 
in the community, and what these exposures may mean. And, of 
course, the $64 question, the loaded question--I am guessing 
you are concerned about people's health in their homes, and I 
know you are.
    Can you elaborate on exactly what precautions are being 
taken to protect them in their homes, and how quick that notice 
would go out if there was a problem?
    Ms. Shore. Thank you, Congressman. As I noted previously, 
EPA has deployed a comprehensive network of air monitoring and 
testing equipment, a multilayered approach. There are 23 sites 
where these Summa canisters and sorbent tubes are installed 
around the community.
    We have this TAGA bus both monitoring the fence line of the 
work site and driving through the community. It can produce 
real-time analysis of air samples so that if there were any 
spikes seen, notification can be made through the Unified 
Command and through the local emergency management agency.
    EPA and Norfolk Southern have safety officers on site at 
the excavation site that meet every morning and discuss the 
work plan and what safety precautions are in place. And they 
are there on site, should anything occur at the work site.
    Mr. Weber. And I know that one of our questions was, of 
course, EPA--this Comprehensive Environmental Response 
Compensation and Liability Act, CERCLA, authority to order 
Norfolk Southern to clean people's houses. What should we tell 
them--in the last 10 seconds, my time--they are cleaning out of 
houses?
    Ms. Shore. That was a plan that is still being negotiated 
with the railroad to--what the specifics of that cleaning 
program will be. We expect it will be rolled out in several 
weeks. That was done out of an abundance of caution, 
understanding that people had concerns. But because we aren't 
detecting any elevated levels of chemicals of concern outside 
of people's homes, we have a very high confidence that they are 
not inside people's homes.
    Mr. Weber. All right, thank you.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back.
    Director Shore--or, I am sorry, Administrator Shore--Mr. 
Sarbanes asked about the list of approved disposal sites. Would 
you provide that list for the record to our committee?
    Ms. Shore. Yes, Congressman, I believe we can.
    Mr. Johnson. OK, thank you. The Chair now recognizes the 
gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Allen, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Allen. Thank you, Chairman Johnson, for holding this 
important hearing today to discuss the government response to 
Norfolk Southern's train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.
    I certainly want to express my continued thoughts and 
prayers to the people impacted by this tragic accident. We 
don't want any community in America to have to endure what the 
people of East Palestine have had to endure the past month. 
Their lives have been disrupted, and it is a tragedy.
    I know this impacted your district directly, Mr. Chair, and 
I thank you for all the work you have done being on the ground 
and working directly with the government entities, and 
communicating to this committee and to your colleagues here in 
Congress the urgency of an investigation to prevent these in 
the future. As we continue to investigate this, government 
response is critical, and ensuring all entities have a clear 
understanding of their roles and responsibilities are crucial.
    Director Vogel, you have been on the ground and know 
firsthand all government entities are working to respond to the 
derailment. Could you discuss Ohio's EPA working relationship 
with other government agencies, whether Federal or local, in 
responding to the train derailment?
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman, thank you for your question. Ohio 
EPA, of course, our emergency response team was on the ground 
at 12:25 a.m. They were the first to arrive. U.S. EPA followed 
shortly thereafter. And we have a very clear delineation of 
duties on the ground. I think we have been working very 
closely.
    Ohio EPA is part of Unified Command, so in terms of 
reviewing the work plans of Norfolk Southern, reviewing the 
work that is ongoing on the track, we both have on-scene 
coordinators there every single day, out looking around the 
site, making sure that the work is being done according to 
plan. So it is a very collaborative effort with our Federal 
response partners.
    Mr. Allen. And have there been challenging--has it been a 
challenge to coordinate Federal and State efforts in regard to 
trying to get to the bottom and the--bottom of the issue, the 
cleanup and the investigation?
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman, I can't think of a challenge that 
we have had with our Federal response partners. I think we have 
been very coordinated in doing our best to get information from 
the railroad at times and making sure that they are doing the 
work plans appropriately. But in terms of coordinating with our 
Federal and local partners, it has been a very good working 
relationship.
    Mr. Allen. Administrator Shore, it is your turn. What do 
you consider--or how would you consider the relationship should 
look like, and how did it look in this incidence between local, 
State, and Federal government?
    Ms. Shore. Like Director Vogel, Congressman, I think this 
has been an example of close coordination, close collaboration, 
respectful partnership. Director Vogel is on my speed dial, and 
we talk frequently, and I have been with her at numerous 
meetings in East Palestine, and that will continue.
    Mr. Allen. Well, thank you for your response and the 
coordination and how you are working together.
    As far as just a followup, as far as overprescribed 
agencies, can you describe what enforcement authorities U.S. 
EPA has under the Comprehensive Environmental Response 
Compensation and Liability Act, and what is it using for the 
cleanup?
    Ms. Shore. Under CERCLA, as you note, that grants EPA the 
authority to hold a principal responsible party--in this case, 
Norfolk Southern--responsible and accountable so that they will 
be required to pay for all the costs of the cleanup, not only 
their own costs but those of EPA and the other responding 
agencies.
    Mr. Allen. In your opinion--and I have got just 30 seconds 
left--how is the recovery going, and how are we doing as far as 
getting this right? How is the process going? Fast enough, not 
fast enough? What can we do to help?
    Ms. Shore. As Chairman Johnson and Chairman McMorris 
Rodgers noted, Norfolk Southern has encountered some 
difficulties in finding and establishing contracts with sites 
to accept both liquid and solid waste. And I think we could 
accelerate the cleanup if they were able to fulfill that 
obligation more expeditiously.
    Mr. Allen. Great. Thank you so much for your testimony this 
morning.
    And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes my colleague and head trauma physician, personal 
head trauma physician, Dr. Ruiz from California, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Ruiz. I hope the wound is getting better.
    Mr. Johnson. It is all better, thank you.
    Mr. Ruiz. Good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Access to clean air and clean drinking water is a human 
right and a common good for all. As a physician and a public 
health expert--and the chairman's personal trauma physician--I 
have seen firsthand how important these are for our communities 
and our children. The residents of East Palestine deserve to 
know that their air--the air they breathe, and the water they 
drink are clean, and Congress has an important role in ensuring 
that the Federal, State, and local government responses protect 
the health of the local community. That is why I am very happy 
we are definitely having this hearing today.
    So, Dr. Vins, can you talk to us about some of the health 
concerns folks are coming into your office with?
    Dr. Vins. Yes, certainly. So we have--thank you for the 
question, Congressman Ruiz. We have two avenues, really, where 
we are receiving feedback from the community.
    So we have the Community Health Assessment Clinic, which we 
have established, as I had in my testimony, at the First Church 
of Christ. The clinic, as residents come in--keep in mind it is 
not a treatment or a diagnosis clinic, but it is more about a 
navigation clinic. And so we invite the residents to come in to 
talk about and kind of capture their experience, and try to 
summarize and help them quantify what their concerns are.
    As you can imagine, it is extremely traumatic, being 
displaced from your home. And so sometimes residents----
    Mr. Ruiz. What are some of the health concerns they have?
    Dr. Vins. So the health concerns that we are seeing largely 
are headaches--through the health assessment clinic, as well as 
our ACE survey--headaches and anxiety, where more than half of 
our residents are experiencing those two----
    Mr. Ruiz. And what are some of the long-term health 
concerns that residents and your providers have?
    Dr. Vins. We have heard a whole wide range of concerns, 
long term. Certainly, cancer is first and foremost, because of 
much of the information that the residents see online and hear, 
as well as reproductive concerns, growth concerns, hormonal 
concerns for their children.
    Mr. Ruiz. Do you think there is a potential with the 
carcinogens or any of the toxins that it could lead to ailments 
4 or 5 years from now?
    Dr. Vins. Yes, I understand your question. Yes. So the--
some of the constituents that we have related to this response, 
obviously, are carcinogenic. However, we are seeing low levels, 
is really the initial response. So I think the long question is 
we don't know.
    Mr. Ruiz. We don't know.
    Dr. Vins. And that is my----
    Mr. Ruiz. And that adds to the anxiety.
    Dr. Vins. I am sorry?
    Mr. Ruiz. And that adds to the anxiety that people have----
    Dr. Vins. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Ruiz [continuing]. Because we don't know.
    Dr. Vins. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Ruiz. While we may still be in the cleanup phase, I 
want to make sure we are thinking about the health impacts this 
community is potentially facing in the long term.
    So Regional Administrator Shore and Director Vogel, what 
are your respective agencies doing to make sure that the health 
and well being of the communities are taken care of?
    And looking to the future, what infrastructure are you 
putting in place to make sure that the cost burden of future 
health impacts isn't falling on the residents of East 
Palestine?
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman, thank you for your question.
    On the municipal water side, two things. We are testing the 
sentinel wells to make sure that, if there is any contamination 
in the creeks, it is not getting into the groundwater. And if 
it is, we will know long before it gets to the well field.
    But also, the railroad has--is paying for a secondary and 
advanced treatment system at the water treatment plant so that 
if there is any detection found--this is an abundance-of-
caution step for the future, just as you said--we have put an 
order in for the granular activated carbon system. I can 
announce that the village approved that last night.
    Mr. Ruiz. Great. Administrator Shore?
    Ms. Shore. Thank you, Congressman. As I stated, EPA will be 
there as long as it takes----
    Mr. Ruiz. Good.
    Ms. Shore [continuing]. For the residents of East Palestine 
to feel that they are----
    Mr. Ruiz. Good. You know who else needs to be there? 
Norfolk. Norfolk Southern needs to be there. So I do want to 
add that I think this committee needs to hear from Norfolk 
Southern directly, and Norfolk Southern needs to commit to 
long-term financial assistance for healthcare costs, for 
impacts stemming from the toxic derailments. They also need to 
commit to long-term engagement on the ground should any further 
contamination be found. And they need to provide assurances 
that other communities won't find themselves in the position 
that East Palestine is in today.
    My district is home to another major freight operations, 
and trains go through many cities in my district. 
Unfortunately, we have seen the local freight railroad, Union 
Pacific, repeatedly stop in the middle of Beaumont City. This 
turns the town into a parking lot, and endangers lives by 
blocking emergency services from reaching their destinations in 
a timely manner, another health risk.
    I think a lot of people, including local leaders in my 
district, want to know how a railroad can properly prevent a 
hazardous chemical spill if that railroad can't even ensure 
that the trains won't block essential traffic.
    To that end, Norfolk Southern should be here today to 
account for what caused the derailment in the first place, 
discuss their current and future cleanup efforts and how they 
will prevent this from happening again.
    Thank you, and I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes Mr. Palmer for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Chairman Johnson. Just a couple of 
questions.
    Is the EPA looking at using the unilateral administrative 
order in regard to the railroad and the cleanup operations?
    Ms. Shore. Congressman, I am not sure I heard your--
properly.
    Mr. Palmer. I am sorry.
    Ms. Shore. I am a bit hearing challenged. But if I did--EPA 
did issue a unilateral administrative order on February 21st. 
It went into effect on the 27th precisely to hold Norfolk 
Southern accountable and to ensure that they will pay all the 
costs of the cleanup.
    Mr. Palmer. Thank you. In regard to what happened 
immediately after the derailment and the burning of the resins 
that was involved there, obviously those are not generally 
considered hazardous. But when you burn things like that, you 
have releases that otherwise wouldn't have been a problem had 
you not burned them. Is that part of the air quality evaluation 
that you are doing, aside from the toxic chemicals that were 
released as a result of the derailment?
    Ms. Shore. Could you rephrase your question? I am sorry. I 
have trouble hearing you.
    Mr. Palmer. I understand that immediately afterwards, one 
of the ways that--one of the things that was done to clean up 
the chemical spill was to burn the resin. There were pellets 
that, as I understand, were part of what was on that train that 
derailed. And those were set on fire to try to, obviously, burn 
them up but also to burn up the chemicals.
    And obviously, when you involve heat and something like 
that, there are other problems that are created. You may 
incinerate all of the chemicals, but you are also releasing 
perhaps PCBs and other things like that into the atmosphere. 
Was that part of the air quality criteria that you looked into 
post the derailment?
    Ms. Shore. Congressman, yes, it was. We continued to assess 
what was happening on the ground and adjust our response, and 
identified a suite of what we call indicator chemicals that 
may--were likely to be produced by the burning of various 
compounds and so on and included those in our suite of things 
we were measuring for.
    Mr. Palmer. Thank you. That is part of what Chairman 
Johnson and I discussed immediately after the derailment of--
what they were doing in that regard for trying to contain the 
chemicals.
    With that, I would be happy to yield the balance of my time 
to the chairman.
    Mr. Johnson. I thank the gentleman for yielding.
    Director Vogel, I want to ask you the same question that I 
asked Administrator Shore a little bit ago. Governor DeWine, in 
a recent Senate hearing, said that the State of Ohio will not 
abandon East Palestine. I believe the Governor is sincere in 
that comment. But for the record here today, do we have the 
commitment from you that your agency and our State government 
will not abandon the people of East Palestine?
    And to that end, in your view, what does it look like to 
fulfill this commitment now and into the future?
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman, thank you for the question. Of 
course, we are Ohio. We live there. We are not going anywhere. 
My entire staff on the ground is from northeast Ohio. It is 
their home. So we will be in--you know, as long as it takes, in 
terms of the cleanup.
    But also, as Dr. Vins has said and the Governor has 
announced, this long-term health clinic, there is a mental 
health grant that has been made available to the village, as 
well. So it is not only the environmental cleanup, but to--rest 
assured that the Governor's entire cabinet is committed to 
that.
    Mr. Johnson. OK, all right. Thank you.
    Administrator Shore, I want to go back to something that 
came up just a little bit ago. You made the statement that we 
could accelerate the cleanup, that Norfolk Southern could 
accelerate the cleanup. Is there any evidence--even after the 
letter that the EPA sent out, is there any evidence that any of 
these States that have certified, licensed, capable disposal 
sites are yielding to pressures from within their State, from 
State officials and others, to--either through price gouging 
perhaps, or capacity excuses, denying the capability for 
Norfolk Southern to get those disposal sites so that they can 
more quickly remove that soil?
    Because we are going to dig into this issue more, because I 
am really concerned about how that has been handled, overall. 
But any evidence that Norfolk Southern is suffering because of 
that?
    Ms. Shore. Chairman Johnson, I respectfully suggest that 
that question is best directed to Norfolk Southern.
    The unilateral order requires----
    Mr. Johnson. Yes, but EPA oversees CERCLA, and you have 
that list. That legal precedent, that legal requirement for 
States to not interfere in interstate commerce, that is 
overseen by the EPA. So do you have any evidence that there has 
been any additional roadblocks to Norfolk Southern getting the 
access that they need to get this material moved?
    And if you don't have an answer to that, you can look into 
it and get back to us.
    Ms. Shore. Let me do that, sir. Thank you.
    Mr. Johnson. OK. All right, thank you.
    With that, the Chair now recognizes the gentlelady, Ms. 
Barragan, for her 5 minutes.
    Ms. Barragan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Director Vogel, in your testimony you said soil testing 
does not show any unsafe levels of contamination in lawns. For 
dioxins, this is measured in toxicity equivalents. And the 
contamination level for EPA that triggers a cleanup in 
residential areas is 1,000 parts per trillion or above. What 
level of toxin is the testing looking for to determine whether 
the soil toxicity is unsafe?
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman, I would defer to U.S. EPA on the 
dioxin testing. It is a work plan that is underway for soils in 
the area.
    There are--there were dioxins tested for in Indiana, as 
well from some of the waste. And those results are publicly 
available. And I am aware that there are some preliminary lab 
tests back that have not shown any concerning health levels of 
contamination in the soil in the park, for example, that I 
mentioned today. But I would defer to Debra Shore for any other 
followup on that.
    Ms. Shore. Congressman Barragan, let me add that the soil 
samples are still being--going through quality assurance 
through the laboratory, but the preliminary reports are that 
there are nothing above what might be considered normal 
background levels in the places where these soil samples have 
been taken.
    Ms. Barragan. So is there, like, a level that is considered 
unsafe?
    I am just trying to--if this testing has been done and they 
have determined that there is nothing unsafe, there's not 
unsafe levels, can you tell us what they are looking for that 
would determine that something is unsafe?
    Ms. Shore. I would have to refer you to our toxicologist. I 
would be happy to arrange a conversation with them and you and 
your staff.
    Ms. Barragan. OK. For many States the contamination level 
is lower than the Federal standard. In California it is 50 
parts per trillion. In Michigan it is 90 parts per trillion. In 
2010 EPA scientists recommended to lower the Federal cleanup 
trigger to 72 parts per trillion, but it did not move forward. 
In 2012 an EPA assessment found the safe level children can be 
in a regular contact with dioxins is 50 parts per trillion or 
less.
    Does anybody know if any of the soil tested in East 
Palestine have toxicity above 50 parts per trillion?
    Ms. Shore. I have not seen the qualified results, but I am 
happy to share them with you once we get them.
    Ms. Barragan. OK. And I am assuming, Director Vogel, you 
don't have anything either.
    Ms. Vogel. I don't. And I would just echo that, once we do 
have tests, we do publish them and we make them publicly 
available.
    Ms. Barragan. Commissioner Vins, anything on this?
    Dr. Vins. I have nothing additional, thank you.
    Ms. Barragan. OK. Administrator Shore, one concern my 
office has heard is that relocation costs are not being covered 
by Norfolk Southern for everyone in East Palestine. How is it 
determined whether a resident is eligible to have their 
relocation costs paid for?
    Ms. Shore. I am sorry to hear that. My understanding was 
that Norfolk Southern was covering temporary relocation costs 
for any resident who sought that. And I would direct you to 
Norfolk Southern to ask why they are being turned down.
    Ms. Barragan. Can the EPA require that Norfolk Southern 
cover relocation costs for anyone in East Palestine?
    Ms. Shore. I will find out.
    Ms. Barragan. OK, Dr. Vins, the testing of drinking water, 
air, and soils have been found to be within safe levels. 
However, your testimony cites examples of residents complaining 
of sore throats and headaches. The Ohio Department of Health 
announced last week it has surveyed 450 residents, and three 
quarters suffered from headaches and half had skin irritation, 
pain, or burning. Many had anxiety, coughs, or fatigue.
    Should we be alarmed by this discrepancy? And do you think 
it is safe now to be a resident in East Palestine?
    Dr. Vins. Yes, thank you for the question, Congresswoman.
    At this point we don't have any evidence of contamination 
associated with the derailment. However, we do continue to hear 
these concerns. I am familiar with some of this information as 
it comes out of our health assessment clinic, in addition to 
the ACE survey. And these are the reasons that we continue to 
do the ACE survey and stand up the health clinic, in addition 
to the ongoing monitoring of the groundwater relative to the 
private wells and our State and Federal partners to monitor air 
and municipal water, as well.
    Ms. Barragan. Well, thank you for that. I want to just--you 
know, my hearts go out to your constituents, Mr. Chairman. And 
as we have heard today, we really need Norfolk Southern here. 
Some of the questions they were not able to answer or defer to 
them. And if I am a resident--and you said this hearing is 
about the residents--if I am a resident, the first question I 
am asking is, ``What happened? How did this happen?'' And that 
requires somebody to be here to be able to also respond to 
that.
    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding back. And 
as I have stated repeatedly, we will have our day to ask those 
questions with the railroad. But it is not today.
    With that, the Chair recognizes the gentlelady from Iowa, 
Mrs. Miller-Meeks, for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I thank all of 
our witnesses for being here today to both provide testimony 
and answer questions.
    Administrator Shore, I first want to thank you for being on 
the ground in the East Palestine community and making outreach 
to those affected by the derailment. Certainly, that is the 
utmost and foremost thing that we should be doing.
    One aspect of EPA's activities in East Palestine that has 
come up a few times is confusion between monitoring and 
sampling. And let me just say I am a physician and a former 
director of the Iowa Department of Public Health. I am hoping 
that we can have a discussion about that.
    Is EPA using monitoring to measure the levels of chemicals 
in people's homes, or is EPA using sampling, and why?
    Ms. Shore. Congresswoman, my understanding is that EPA has 
been using monitoring devices inside homes because our suite of 
highly sophisticated measuring, monitoring, and sampling 
devices outside homes has provided us with information showing 
that there aren't elevated levels outside, so we had no 
expectation we would see them inside.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. So your thought is that the equipment is 
capable of determining if the chemical is below the safe 
exposure level.
    Ms. Shore. I am sorry. Could you repeat the question?
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. So then you are--from that I infer that 
you think the equipment itself is capable of determining that 
the chemical is below the safe exposure level.
    Ms. Shore. We think so, yes.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. OK. And what about a mixture of 
chemicals? So is the detection equipment able to determine if 
exposure to the mixture of chemicals is below the safe exposure 
level, rather than just an individual chemical?
    Ms. Shore. As I understand it, these--this equipment can 
test for a suite of volatile organic compounds up to 59.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Thank you.
    Director Vogel, in your testimony you referenced that the 
removal of contaminated soil and water from East Palestine will 
likely take another 2 months. Does that timeline assume that 
the current pace of waste removal will continue?
    Ms. Vogel. Congressman, yes. We are seeing as many as 40, 
45 trucks a day taking soil out of East Palestine this week. So 
if that pace continues, yes.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. And do you foresee any challenges to 
achieving full removal of soil and water waste in 2 months?
    Ms. Vogel. As Administrator Shore has said, contingent on 
finding--Norfolk Southern finding additional contracts with 
places to take the soil--I am not going to predict that there 
will be no more challenges, but things are on pace as of today.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. And how is the Ohio EPA working with the 
U.S. EPA, the Columbiana County General Health District, and 
Norfolk Southern to meet that goal?
    Ms. Vogel. I think we are working very closely together. 
Again, as all part of Unified Command, we--there are morning 
meetings, but there are also meetings, operational meetings, 
throughout the day, public health meetings that all of our--the 
State, the Feds, and the locals are represented on. So I think 
that is a very close collaboration.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Thank you. And I am going to go back to 
the sampling data and discuss the quality assurance of the 
sampling data.
    So Director Shore, has EPA sampling data been quality 
assured?
    Ms. Shore. Congresswoman, I believe that the samples from 
the Summa canister sent for laboratory analysis have gone 
through that quality assurance. I need to learn more about the 
real-time sampling that is done by the TAGA bus.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. So the reason I ask, the EPA's website 
says it is not. So Director Vogel, do you have any information 
on that?
    Ms. Vogel. The U.S. EPA website, or--OK. I can't speak to 
that. Ohio EPA's website posts the sampling data for the 
municipal wells from----
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. OK.
    Ms. Vogel. Directly from the labs.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. So I guess my concern is if the EPA's 
website says that the sampling data hasn't been quality 
assured, how did the EPA make the determination that the air is 
safe to breathe, when it appears that the sampling data has not 
been quality assured?
    Ms. Shore. Congresswoman, I am going to ask our staff to 
get back to you with an answer for that.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Thank you very much. We would appreciate 
having that submitted to us after the committee.
    Thank you so much, Mr. Chair----
    Mr. Johnson. Well, the gentlelady yield the remaining time?
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Yes, sir. I will yield the remaining 
time.
    Mr. Johnson. Dr. Vins, in your testimony you call for a 
long-term private well sampling program. Has Norfolk Southern 
engaged with you on creating and funding this program?
    Dr. Vins. We have not had that conversation. Thank you.
    Mr. Johnson. OK. Has the Ohio Department of Health provided 
any additional support to do that?
    Dr. Vins. For the long-term program, sir?
    Mr. Johnson. Right, right.
    Dr. Vins. At this point we have not had that long-term 
conversation.
    Mr. Johnson. Any progress that you can report on that 
front?
    Dr. Vins. Well, at this point our sampling program is an 
ongoing monitoring effort. The frequency of that program has 
not been established as to what the long-term needs might be, 
and that is why the monitoring at this point is very important.
    Mr. Johnson. OK. And Director Vogel, has the Ohio EPA been 
involved in any of these discussions?
    Ms. Vogel. We would be happy to, Congressman. Ohio EPA is 
responsible for the public water systems, and defer to the 
county on the private wells.
    Mr. Johnson. OK.
    Ms. Vogel. We would be happy----
    Mr. Johnson. All right, thank you.
    Ms. Vogel [continuing]. To be part of a conversation.
    Mr. Johnson. With that, the Chair now recognizes--now that 
all members of the subcommittee have had a chance to ask their 
questions, we now go to Mrs. Dingell, from the full committee, 
from Michigan for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Dingell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and for all the work 
that you have done. No community in America should ever have to 
endure the level of devastation and concern to both public 
health and the environment that resulted in the aftermath of 
this derailment in your district.
    This is an important hearing for this committee to hold, 
and I want to thank the EPA Administrator Shore, as well as 
Ohio EPA and Columbiana County for agreeing to be here today, 
because we can learn from what you are saying. Your testimony 
and experience will be valuable for understanding the 
successful efforts that have gone into this Federal, State, and 
local response to protect the health and safety of the people 
of East Palestine. It is our shared duty.
    Unfortunately, I have gotten--or fortunately gotten--to 
know the EPA region 5 administrator fairly well because, while 
we haven't had anything quite as bad as you had, we have had 
hexavalent chromium spills, gas leaks into sewer systems. We 
know the TAGA bus well, and so I know what these issues are.
    Mr. Chairman, I know everybody says this, but I got to say 
it again: I find it deeply confounding that the responsible 
party for this disaster is not here. How can we possibly get a 
full understanding of what happened at East Palestine and the 
cleanup effort that continues if the company responsible is not 
here?
    Norfolk Southern should have been invited as a witness here 
today, and I want to say that for the record, and I don't think 
that anybody understands the critical role that they are still 
playing to make any of them able to do their job.
    But one of the reasons I am here is, following the Norfolk 
Southern derailment, the controlled burn of the hazardous 
materials and the unilateral administrative order issued by EPA 
under CERCLA to Norfolk Southern to clean up the site.
    On Friday, February 24th I learned about--from a press 
release from the Governor that was posted that some of the 
hazardous materials were--actually, were already there by the 
time that we learned about it, one in my district and one close 
by.
    And I think there has been a lot of misinformation about 
what happened that night, as well. Some of the initial disposal 
shipments made it to their destinations; 300,000 gallons of 
hazardous liquid were accepted and disposed at the Romulus 
injection well site, and 360 tons of soil were accepted and 
disposed of in Van Buren.
    What most people don't understand is that the CERCLA--the 
Romulus injection well, which I happen to know very well 
because it has been the site of--look, I opposed it when it was 
first built; it has been shut down, and I knew it was not 
CERCLA-certified, so I started asking questions immediately. 
Most people didn't even understand what I was asking. EPA did, 
and I want to thank them for working with us to prevent further 
material from going to a noncertified site.
    And I want to thank all of you for going above and beyond 
to try to do community outreach, which is really important in 
these situations.
    Administrator Shore, could you explain in more detail for 
this committee why it took so long for EPA to be designated as 
the lead oversight agency, and what role Norfolk Southern 
played in sending those materials to Michigan? It was they that 
made the decision, not you at first, correct?
    Ms. Shore. Thank you, Congresswoman Dingell, and I 
appreciate your support and engagement.
    It--I am told it is typical in these emergency response 
situations where the lead agency in the initial days of the 
response is the State, which has delegated authority from 
Federal EPA. And Ohio EPA was serving in that role quite ably, 
and we were working together in that capacity.
    Norfolk Southern made the decisions about where it was 
going to transport the liquid and solid waste, and we were--we 
don't make that choice, even now under CERCLA. We just provide 
them with a list of approved sites.
    Mrs. Dingell. So as I listen to Ohio EPA talk about your 
confidence--Norfolk Southern is not here, but I have sure had a 
lot of conversations, and I think there are sites that, if 
Norfolk Southern would pay a little more money, that could be 
sent to--now. And I think, Mr. Chairman, we should be asking 
that question.
    But right now, Administrator Shore, now that the 
administrative order is in place, I just want assurances that 
you are certifying and confirming all waste sites are approved 
to accept hazardous waste being sent to them, correct?
    Ms. Shore. Yes, under CERCLA it is required. And we made 
sure that the disposal site has to be on that off-site approval 
list. They have to have the capacity, and they need to have a 
binding agreement, either a letter of intent or a contract with 
Norfolk Southern.
    Mrs. Dingell. Mr. Chairman, I am out of time, but I would 
like your permission to put more questions in the record, 
because I have, unfortunately, learned too much in the last 
couple of years about the importance of Federal, State, and 
local governments working together, what they can do, what they 
can't do. And maybe there's some things we could work on 
together to improve.
    Mr. Johnson. OK, thank you. The gentlelady's time has 
expired.
    Since no one else is seeking time, I would ask unanimous 
consent that two----
    Mr. Tonko. Mr. Chairman?
    Mr. Johnson. I yield to the ranking member.
    Mr. Tonko. No, you are entering----
    Mr. Johnson. Yes.
    Mr. Tonko [continuing]. To the record. I will let you----
    Mr. Johnson. Yes, I ask unanimous consent that two letters 
be added for the record: a letter from the Association of 
American Railroads and comments from the National Safety 
Council.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr. Johnson. And for what purpose does the ranking member--
--
    Mr. Tonko. I just wanted to share that I believe that--I am 
encouraged by the cooperative, collaborative efforts being made 
in that partnership with Federal and State government--and 
local government, I should include. And so that is encouraging.
    And again, I commit myself to help however possible in this 
situation.
    I do caution, though, if we go to 2022 levels of 
appropriations, it puts this situation at risk. I would hope 
that the majority would not do that, because it would perhaps 
put pressure on EPA to get this work done correctly, especially 
if Norfolk Southern should abandon its responsibilities to move 
in its corporate responsible way.
    So let's make certain that we have these budget items so--
down so correctly that they will be a strong force in getting 
this work done.
    With that, I yield back.
    Mr. Johnson. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. Let 
it be said, for anybody that is looking, who wonder if 
Republicans and Democrats can ever agree with each other, I 
agree with what my ranking member just said, and I too am 
pleased with the collaborative efforts of the U.S. EPA, the 
State EPA, and the local county health officials, and others 
that have been so involved in this.
    We have got a long way to go before this is finished. I can 
assure you that I am definitely here for the long haul, and I 
have restated that, and I will restate it for this committee. 
The long haul is when the people of East Palestine say, ``We 
are done.'' That is when it is done. Not until.
    With that I remind Members that they have 10 business days 
to submit questions for the record, and I ask the witnesses to 
respond to the questions promptly. Members should submit their 
questions by the close of business on April 11th.
    Without objection, the committee is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:18 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
