                       WEDNESDAY, MARCH 15, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
           Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations,
                                                    Washington, DC.

    The subcommittee met at 10:01 a.m., in room SD-138, Dirksen 
Senate Office Building, Hon. Jack Reed (Chairman), presiding.
    Present: Senators Reed and Fischer.

                    THE GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE


                 opening statement of senator jack reed


    Senator Reed. 2024 budget hearing, for the Legislative 
Branch Appropriations Subcommittee.
    I would like to welcome the Ranking Member, Senator 
Fischer, to the Appropriations Committee, and our subcommittee. 
As the Ranking Member of the Committee on Rules, she brings to 
this new role a wealth of knowledge about the operations of the 
Senate and its support agencies.
    And I know from serving with her on the Armed Services 
Committee, that she is a diligent worker, and a principal 
partner. I am delighted to be working with her, and the other 
Members of the subcommittee, in crafting responsible funding 
legislation that supports the Legislative Branch.
    Today, we have with us the Comptroller General, Gene 
Dodaro; Director Halpern; and Director Phillip Swagel. I would 
like to thank you for joining us to testify on your agency's 
fiscal year 2024 budget.
    I ask unanimous consent that the witnesses' written 
testimony be placed in the hearing record.
    Hearing no objection, so ordered.
    Again, let me begin by thanking the women and men of your 
agencies who work every day to facilitate the work of the 
Senate. Your agencies play key roles in ensuring that the 
Senate can perform its constitutional responsibilities.
    The Legislative Branch agencies have submitted to fiscal 
year 2024 budget request, that account for a $259-million 
increase over the fiscal year 2023 Legislative Branch 
Appropriations. While it is a priority to fund the important 
work of this Branch, we will be carefully considering these 
requests to ensure they continue to improve our ability to meet 
our responsibilities to govern effectively.
    In fiscal year 2024, the GAO is requesting $859.7 million 
in appropriated funds, which is an increase of $69.4 million 
over the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. The request proposes 
increasing the agencies' staffing level to 3,675 personnel, to 
fill critical skill gaps, and fulfill the GAO's mission to 
support Congress.
    With the mandate required of the GAO to oversee spending of 
pandemic and Ukraine assistance funding, as well as many other 
mandates to conduct audits and assessments of Federal programs, 
the GAO's workload continues to grow.
    The agencies' request also includes funding to continue 
building GAO's Science, Technology Assessment, and Analytics 
team to provide Congress with the most critical current 
information about technology. The GAO performs critical work on 
behalf of the Senate, and I look forward to hearing from 
Comptroller General Dodaro on his agency's work.
    Today, we will also be reviewing the Government Printing 
Office request. The GPO is seeking an appropriation of $132.5 
million in fiscal year 2024, which is an increase of $2.6 
million over the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. The agency's 
request includes funding to continue its transformation to 
digital technologies which have increased productivity and 
reduce cost while facilitating public access to Congressional 
and other Government information.
    The work that the agency performs on a daily basis for the 
Senate is critical, and I look forward to the Director's 
testimony.
    And we will also hear from the Congressional Budget Office. 
The CBO plays an important nonpartisan role as it tries to 
provide clear, and objective, timely analysis, and reporting on 
budgetary and economic information for the Congress.
    The agency's fiscal year 2024 budget request of $70.8 
million, which is an increase of $7.5 million over fiscal year 
2023 enacted levels. This increase provides salary and benefits 
for 11 new positions that are intended to continue to improve 
the responsiveness of the agency to the Congress so that 
Legislative work can be informed by the important information 
provided by the agency. The increase also provides funding to 
improve the agency's cyber security infrastructure.
    Director Swagel and I have discussed the importance of the 
CBO's work, and how critical a timely response to Congressional 
requests is to our ability to conduct our work. I look forward 
to hearing about the innovative things the agency is doing to 
meet customer service expectations.
    With that said, the goal of the Senate Appropriations 
Committee is to return to normal order for appropriations 
bills. As such, this subcommittee will be aggressively working 
to produce a thoughtfully crafted bill that can be considered 
by the Full Committee and the Senate in the coming months.
    I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses, and to 
working with Senator Fischer towards this goal.
    And now, I will return to the Ranking Member, Senator 
Fischer, for any remarks she might have. Thank you.


                opening statement of senator deb fischer


    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    This is my first hearing with the Appropriations Committee, 
and I am grateful for the opportunity to serve as Ranking 
Member of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee.
    Chairman Reed, I have greatly enjoyed serving with you on 
the Armed Services Committee. I look forward to working with 
you on this subcommittee and crafting a fiscally responsible 
bill that will meet the needs of our agencies and their work to 
support the Congress.
    I would like to thank the three witnesses for appearing 
before the subcommittee today, and for their testimony.
    Before I discuss the specific details of your budget 
requests, I must note that we are entering an uncertain budget 
cycle. After years of significant spending increases the 
Federal Government, as a whole, must exercise more fiscal 
constraint. Throughout this year's appropriations process we 
need to be good stewards of taxpayer funds, and make 
investments where they are truly needed.
    Mr. Dodaro, as the Comptroller of the United States, you 
play a critical role in providing oversight of Government 
spending and finding needed improvements in Federal programs. 
For fiscal year 2024, the GAO seeks an increase of $69 million. 
This is a sizable request. I would like to hear from you how 
this proposed increase will expand audit capacity, and provide 
greater oversight of the Executive Branch.
    Dr. Swagel, the Congressional Budget Office--or the 
Congressional Budget Office's fiscal year 2024 request focuses 
on hiring new staff and building increased IT capacities. In 
your testimony I hope to hear how these proposed increases will 
improve CBO's forecasting accuracy and responsiveness to 
Congress.
    Mr. Halpern, the Government Publishing Office serves a much 
needed role in producing and preserving the official documents 
of the Federal Government. The GPO's budget request continues 
funding the transition to digital technologies that will 
achieve savings, while also increasing transparency for the 
American public. I look forward to learning more about these 
efforts in your testimony.
    Again, thank you, to our witnesses for being here today, I 
expect to have a productive conversation on these budget 
requests.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Reed. Thank you, Senator Fischer.
    I would like to first recognize, Comptroller General 
Dodaro, and then Director Halpern; and then, finally, Director 
Swagel.
                                ------                                


                  THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE

STATEMENT OF HON. GENE L. DODARO, COMPTROLLER GENERAL, 
            THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY 
            OFFICE
    General Dodaro. Thanks very much Mr. Chairman, good 
afternoon to you. Ranking Member, Senator Fischer, good 
afternoon. I am very pleased to be here to discuss GAO's 
request for fiscal year 2024.
    First, I want to thank this Committee for its past support 
of GAO's work. I believe we have provided a good return on 
investment. Last year as a result of the implementation of our 
recommendations there were financial benefits to the government 
of over $55 billion. And on average over the last 5 years, we 
have returned $145 to every dollar spent on GAO.
    Our work, for example, pointing out overlap duplication and 
fragmentation in the Federal Government is now in its 12th 
year. In the first 11 years, there have been financial savings 
of $552 billion. So we have passed the half-trillion mark in 
that area.
    Our work continues to be in high demand. We provide 
services to over 90 percent of the standing Congressional 
Committees as Members, Chairs, and Ranking Members request 
work. Our list of statutory mandates continues to grow. There 
are 158 mandates in the National Defense Authorization Act for 
this year and almost 100 mandates in the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act for 2023. There are 35 mandates in the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the Inflation 
Reduction Act requires GAO oversight. So far we have 32 
engagements ongoing or planned in that area.
    Mr. Chairman you mentioned the work in the Ukraine, where 
we were directed to provide oversight of the Federal assistance 
provided. We will be tracking military aid and humanitarian 
assistance, and looking at the replenishment at DOD of the 
military equipment provided to Ukraine.
    Also, recently, given the banking situation over the 
weekend, another mandate that GAO has will be triggered because 
we have to look at any designation of systemic risk made by the 
regulators. We also, during a global financial crisis, received 
statutory authority to review any Fed Emergency Lending 
Facility. So we will be looking at the lending facility the Fed 
recently set up. The CHIPS Bill had about 10 mandates for us as 
well.
    So demand, as you point out, Mr. Chairman, continues to 
grow. And I think it is a good thing because the list of our 
domestic and international issues continue to grow. GAO can 
provide good assistance to the Congress in addressing these 
pressing national issues.
    Now, Senator Fischer, of the 165 new FTEs that we want; 
there are four areas that I would like to increase our 
resources in. One is the science and technology area. Congress 
gave GAO the responsibility to conduct technology assessments. 
We are currently conducting assessments of forensic attribution 
of chemical weapons, regenerative medicine, and precision 
agriculture, which is one of the requirements in the CHIPS Act. 
And we will conduct a technology assessment of satellite 
defense technologies.
    The use of artificial intelligence, biotechnology, 
decarbonization technologies, and other technologies is 
increasing faster than any time in human history. It is very 
important that GAO provide these technology assessments to the 
Congress so they can make timely and informed decisions.
    Second, is National Defense: In addition to the Ukraine 
assistance that we will examine, there are 158 mandates in the 
National Defense Authorization Act. We have deep knowledge in 
every service in the DOD. For example, we are looking at the 
Air Force Modernization and the Nuclear Command Control 
Communication Systems.
    I would like to do more work in the readiness of the Guard 
and the Reserve and in the recruitment areas. We have noted the 
Army is having recruitment problems and the Air Force just 
noted some recruitment problems as well. So there is much more 
work to do, particularly as we strive to maintain our 
competitive advantage against competitors in China, Russia, and 
others. So I think that is very important.
    Third, is cyber security: We have been advocating for many 
years that we have a national cyber security strategy. The 
Administration just issued one, but the government needs an 
implementation plan to make sure it is implemented effectively. 
GAO has deep knowledge in cyber security and can help to 
examine this important area.
    The last area I will mention is health care. Health care 
costs are growing faster than any other part of the Federal 
Government. And if we are going to get control over our budget 
deficit and cumulative debt we must do more work to control 
spending in the health care area. We have a lot of suggestions 
on ways to save in that area, and can help Congress figure out 
how to control those costs.
    So thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Senator Fischer. I 
would be happy to answer questions at the appropriate time.

    Senator Reed. Thank you, very much Comptroller General.
    Director Halpern, please.
                                ------                                


                    THE GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE

STATEMENT OF HON. HUGH N. HALPERN, DIRECTOR, GOVERNMENT 
            PUBLISHING OFFICE
    Mr. Halpern. Thank you, Mr. Chairman; Ranking Member 
Fischer.
    I would note, this is also my first hearing before the 
Senate Appropriations Committee, so I am very happy to be here.
    For fiscal year 2024, GPO is requesting about $132.5 
million in appropriated funds, which is, overall, about a 2 
percent increase, well below the level of inflation.
    As you know GPO operates very much as a commercial 
enterprise, about 88 percent of our, more than a billion-dollar 
annual budget comes from directly billing our other Federal 
customers. Of the three categories covered by our 
appropriations request the largest is what funds Congress' own 
needs.
    Based on our experience we estimate that we will need about 
$83 million for Congress' printing and publishing work during 
fiscal year 2024. That will cover everything from the 
Congressional record, bills, reports, hearings, and more 
specialized publications, stationery, and unique materials, 
such as the blank books that the Senate and the House use to 
keep the journal.
    The second category of funding is for GPO's public 
information programs. We are requesting about $37 million to 
fund the Federal Depository Library Program, and support the 
operation of GovInfo, the world's only ISO-certified, trusted 
digital repository.
    Our partnership with about 1,100 libraries nationwide, and 
continued investment in our digital offerings, ensures that 
government documents are easily available regardless of how you 
get them. This request also, notably, includes funding to 
implement the recently enacted access to Congressionally 
Mandated Reports Act.
    Lastly, we are requesting a direct appropriation of about 
$12.1 million to our revolving fund to support a few specific 
agency initiatives, and that is an increase of less than $0.5 
million from our last appropriation.
    The specific appropriation funds the continued development 
of XPub, our next-generation composition engine, among some 
other priorities. This is a major agency initiative central to 
our own modernization efforts, and those of our customers that 
use our software in their printing stack.
    I am proud that last fall XPub released the--reached the 
Release 1.0 stage, and is now in testing with our customers in 
the Senate, and House Offices of Legislative Council.
    It is my sincere hope that our customers will be 
comfortable enough to start using XPub to produce bills, 
resolutions, and amendments as early as this summer. Once it 
enters production, we will see new capabilities come online, 
such as fully responsive and formatted text view of 
legislation, which will allow that output to be repurposed for 
any number of purposes
    So with that, I will wrap up, and just thank you, on behalf 
of myself, and everybody at GPO, our 1,600 craftspeople and 
professionals; to thank you for your past support, and support 
in the future.
    And I am ready to answer any questions you may have.
    [The statement follows:]
       Prepared Statement of The Honorable Hugh Nathanial Halpern
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Fischer, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, I am honored to present the Government Publishing 
Office's (GPO's) fiscal year 2024 appropriations request. I thank you 
and your staff for your past support of GPO and I look forward to 
working closely with you during my time as Director. For the coming 
fiscal year, I am requesting appropriations in the amount of 
$132,488,000, an increase of $2,634,000 over our FY 2023 appropriation.
    This marks just the third time in a decade that GPO has requested 
an increase in appropriated funds and incorporates increased costs in 
labor and materials, while accommodating certain initiatives of 
importance to Congress. Our FY 2024 request represents a 2 percent 
increase over FY 2023, less than a third of the increase in the 
consumer price index during calendar year 2022. It is also 10.2 percent 
lower than the Agency's all-time high appropriation of $147.5 million 
in FY 2010.
    GPO runs as a business enterprise and appropriated funds represent 
a comparatively small portion of GPO's overall revenue and operating 
capital. Over 88 percent--or $934 million--of GPO's FY 2022 revenue of 
$1.06 billion came from billings of its other Federal customers, 
including the State Department, the courts, the Department of Defense, 
and many others. For FY 2024, we estimate that direct appropriations 
may be an even smaller portion of our overall budget.
              charting a course for the future in fy 2022
    At GPO, fiscal year 2022 was one of significant accomplishment and 
encouraging progress. After a challenging 2020, the Agency was able to 
close out our books with a net positive income for the 2nd straight 
year, retaining $26.2 million in FY 2022.
    We are also proud that our efforts to modernize and build a dynamic 
and welcoming workplace are starting to attract attention. Forbes 
Magazine recently rated us--for the 2nd year running!--as one of 
America's Best Midsize Employers after having also honored us as one of 
the nation's Best Employers for Veterans in 2022.
    To help chart a new course for our agency, in FY 2022 we released 
an ambitious five-year strategic plan for fiscal years 2023 through 
2027 and updated our vision and mission statements to better reflect 
GPO's role in our digital present. Today, GPO's vision is that of an 
America Informed, and we aim to achieve our mission of publishing 
trusted information for the Federal Government to the American people 
guided by four key values--honesty, kindness, effectiveness, and 
inclusiveness.
    We also convened the Task Force on a Digital Federal Depository 
Library Program (FDLP) to modernize the FDLP to meet the challenges of 
the future. The Task Force issued recommendations in December and I 
recently shared with Congress a set of legislative proposals consistent 
with those recommendations.
    During FY 2022, GPO completed the transition from the production of 
the ePassport for the State Department to the Next Generation Passport 
(NGP) Program. This transition reaffirmed the United States' position 
as the global leader in the most innovative and secure international 
travel credentials and concluded production of the ePassport after a 
production run of more than 220 million units between 2007 and 2022. 
All told we produced a total of 18,151,000 ePassports and NGPs in FY 
2022.
    GPO's single biggest challenge is maintaining a workforce prepared 
to carry on its work well into the future. Fifty percent of our 
workforce is eligible to retire in the next 4 years. That's one out of 
every two proofreaders, presspeople, bookbinders, carpenters, 
electricians, IT specialists, contracting officers, and a host of other 
trades and professions working at GPO. To ensure that GPO continues to 
attract and retain an exceptional workforce in the years ahead, we 
established the Recent Graduates Program and restarted our 
Apprenticeship Program in FY 2022.
    We also readied ourselves to execute the requirements of the 
Congressionally Mandated Reports Act, which directs GPO to build a 
portal to make those reports publicly available, and we celebrated the 
9 billionth retrieval of government information from Agency websites 
since GPO began publishing government information in 1994.
    Our Customer Services business unit awarded $477 million in 
competitive contracts to private-sector printers nationwide supporting 
thousands of jobs in all 50 states, and their biennial survey revealed 
a customer satisfaction rate of 95.3 percent.
    We produced tickets and credentials for the Supreme Court 
nomination hearing of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson and had the solemn 
honor of creating the Lying In State Memorial Programs for 
Representative Don E. Young, former Senate Majority Leader Harry M. 
Reid, and former Senate Majority Leader Robert J. Dole.
    And--for the 26th consecutive year--GPO's independent outside 
auditor provided us with an unmodified, or clean, opinion on our annual 
financial statements.
                  gpo's fy 2024 appropriations request
    For FY 2024, GPO is requesting an $2,634,000 increase in 
appropriations to $132,488,000. This increase will account for changes 
in our labor and raw materials costs and also fund certain ongoing 
projects of importance to congressional customers.
    This would be GPO's only third proposed increase in appropriations 
since FY 2014 and is actually 10.2 percent less than our FY 2010 
appropriation. Increased productivity through the adoption of new 
technologies has been key to keeping GPO's needs for appropriations 
down, and providing new and improved services at lower costs.
    One tool we used to keep our appropriations requests low was to 
repurpose prior-year unexpended balances. We appreciate the willingness 
of this Subcommittee and the Full Committee to allow GPO to use those 
balances in support of programs and capital investments that benefit 
the original purpose of the appropriated funds.
    However, those balances are declining which forces GPO to request 
additional funds if we are to continue our current pace of development 
and innovation.
    Our FY 2024 request includes $83,000,000 for congressional 
publishing, just $8,000 more than our FY 2023 appropriation. It is 
based on our estimates of Congress' likely needs and available 
unexpended balances. It also incorporates increased costs for raw 
materials and labor. In constant-dollar terms it represents a 35 
percent reduction for congressional publishing appropriations since FY 
2010.
    Our request for our public information programs (PIP) account, 
through which we administer the nationwide Federal Depository Library 
Program, is $37,388,000. This represents an increase of $2,131,000--or 
6 percent--over FY 2023, and will cover the costs of providing Federal 
Government publications in digital and tangible formats to 1,100 
Federal depository libraries nationwide, cataloging and indexing, and 
distributing documents to recipients designated by law and 
international exchanges. In addition to increased compensation and 
materials costs, this request also includes some implementation costs 
attributed to the Congressionally Mandated Reports Act.
    Even with this proposed increase, the PIP appropriation will be 8.6 
percent lower than the amount appropriated in FY 2010, or 34 percent 
lower in constant-dollar terms.
    The final component of our appropriations request is for a total of 
$12,100,000 for GPO's revolving fund to support capital investments and 
information technology upgrades, which represents an increase of 
$495,000 over amounts appropriated in FY 2023. This component of our 
request is critically important to ensuring that GPO can make the 
capital investments in equipment and technology needed to continue 
providing Congress and our Federal agency customers with the high level 
of service they expect.
    This request will support three specific capital investment 
projects that will be familiar to the Subcommittee, as they represent 
longstanding GPO priorities.
    First, we are seeking direct appropriations support for our 
continued development of the XPub composition system, which is intended 
to fully replace our proprietary MicroComp composition system, which is 
more than 30 years old.
    A transformational project for GPO, XPub is being deployed on a 
product-by-product basis. Our current release is in testing with our 
House and Senate customers and is slated to be in production with the 
House, Senate, and GPO Bill End during FY 2023. Features in this 
release include integration with House and Senate XML authoring tools 
for bills, and a new responsive HTML display for congressional bills 
and Public Laws.
    If approved, our $6,575,000 appropriation request will keep XPub 
development and deployment on track in FY 2024. Once development is 
complete, we hope to provide XPub to our customers as a software-as-a-
service (SAAS) application, ensuring that there is a dedicated stream 
of income to support continued development of the platform without the 
need for separate recurring appropriations.
    The second component of GPO's FY 2024 request for increased capital 
investment appropriations would support continued development of the 
GovInfo online portal, the world's only ISO-certified trusted digital 
repository. In recent years, the Subcommittee directly appropriated 
funds to refresh GovInfo's infrastructure and further develop its 
content collections. This year's request of $5,375,000 for GovInfo is 
$500,000 less than the amount appropriated in FY 2023, and it would be 
divided between infrastructure investments ($1,875,000) and development 
investments ($3,500,000), including the digitization of historical 
content.
    With the Subcommittee's sustained support, GPO has been able to add 
hundreds of thousands of additional documents to the GovInfo online 
repository each year--over 152,000 content packages were added in FY 
2022--and the public's usage of GovInfo continues to grow, with more 
than 868 million retrievals from GovInfo in FY 2022.
    The third component of GPO's request for increased appropriations 
for its business operations revolving fund account is for $150,000 to 
support GPO's broad and ongoing efforts to defend against advanced 
persistent threat attacks (APTs) to its information technology systems.
    Lastly, before I conclude, I want to add that, as required by 
section 1604(c) of the Legislative Branch Inspectors General 
Independence Act, we have forwarded our Inspector General's request for 
$7,243,000 in budget authority for FY 2024 as part of our FY 2024 
Budget Submission. Currently that request is funded as part of GPO's 
agency overhead--a component of the prices and rates GPO charges its 
agency customers and Congress--and not as a separate appropriation.
    Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Fischer, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to present GPO's FY 2024 
appropriations request, and for all the support you and your staff have 
extended to us during these challenging past 2 years. This completes my 
prepared statement, and I look forward to answering any questions you 
may have.

    Senator Reed. Thank you, Mr. Director.
    Director Swagel, please.
                                ------                                


                      CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE

STATEMENT OF HON. DR. PHILLIP SWAGEL, DIRECTOR, 
            CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE
    Dr. Swagel. Thank you, Chairman Reed; Ranking Member 
Fischer, thank you for the opportunity to present the 
Congressional Budget Office's budget request.
    The purpose of my testimony today to request an 
appropriation of $70.8 million for fiscal year 2024. This is an 
increase of $7.5 million, or 12 percent, over the amount 
provided in 2023.
    I recognize that is a large request. A big part of that 
reflects inflation and paying for deferred IT costs from 2023. 
Our request is targeted to support CBO's mission to provide 
nonpartisan analysis to the Congress that is timely, rigorous, 
and transparent. We will carry out this mission with integrity.
    CBO is here to support you. We support the Appropriations 
Committee and the authorizing committees in several ways. When 
legislation is heading to a vote, or is on the floor, CBO staff 
analyze amendments in real time, sometimes hundreds or even 
thousands of them for bills such as the NDAA, or last year's 
CHIPS Act and the 2022 reconciliation legislation.
    CBO staff worked long hours over the past few months on 
last year's major legislation, most recently the December 2022 
Omnibus. We are working hard to provide Congress with timely 
and accurate budget and economic projections, cost estimates, 
and other information.
    Our request for 2024 will enable us to do even better in 
terms of our responsiveness and transparency. Roughly, two-
thirds, or 4.8 million, of the proposed $7.5-million increase 
would be for personnel costs. That amount would cover salaries 
and benefits to hire 11 new staff members in 2024, and to fully 
fund the staff members we hired at various times in 2023.
    These new hires would allow CBO to provide more analysis in 
particular areas of Congressional focus, such as Defense and 
Homeland Security, especially energy, infrastructure, and 
climate, health policy, income security, immigration, and to 
improve our long-term budget analysis.
    Even while the increase would allow us to grow, most of the 
request would cover inflation adjustments and performance-based 
salary increases for the staff we already have.
    The remaining part, about $2.8 million, would be for non-
personnel costs, and represents a 57 percent increase over last 
year. The increase is large because last year CBO deferred 
expenses for certain computing services and equipment.
    We are now analyzing the President's budget to provide 
information for the appropriations process. We support the 
Appropriators Committees by providing real time provision-by-
provision estimates of the 12 annual appropriations bills, and 
any supplemental appropriations bills that come. And similarly, 
we will provide hundreds of cost estimates for legislation. 
This year CBO is committed to returning to its historical 
benchmark of providing cost estimates before a floor vote for 
nearly all bills that have been ordered reported.
    We will publish dozens of reports, both statutory and 
requested, and we will work with member offices in both 
Chambers as they consider and draft legislation. We will 
publish interactive tools, presentations, slide decks, and 
other products to bring our work to a wide audience, and to 
increase the transparency of our analysis.
    So finally, let me just recap. To achieve our goal to be as 
responsive as possible, CBO requests an increase of $7.5 
million. With your support, we look forward to continuing to 
provide timely and high quality analysis to the Congress.
    Thank you for your support. And I am happy to take any 
questions.

    Senator Reed. Thank you very much, gentlemen, for your 
testimony, and for the great work that you have done, and your 
colleagues have done to support the Congress.
    Comptroller General Dodaro, you spoke, and in fact we had a 
chance to speak on the phone. I really appreciate you taking 
the time from your little sabbatical with the family. And one 
of the issues that we spoke about was, again, a part of today's 
testimony, that is the mandates that you receive as both 
Members of the Armed Forces Committee, many of them come from 
us, but not all.
    General Dodaro. Right.
    Senator Reed. Let me put the record straight, but not all, 
we carry a lot of other bills; but those mandates I think are--
if you could comment on how they impact your work and how you 
have structured the budget to ensure you cover all those 
mandates.
    And also, I think it is worthwhile emphasizing, again, the 
fact that the--and the cost benefit analyses, the benefits you 
have rendered to the Congress and the Nation have been 
significant. So if you could comment?
    General Dodaro. Yes, absolutely. First, I believe mandates 
are a very important part of GAO's work. We track every week, 
every bill that is introduced in Congress, and there are 
hundreds of mandates every year from committees across 
Congress, including outside the Defense Committees. I think 
they are important, and we try to work with the committees to 
make sure that what actually gets passed are mandates within 
our scope of authority and competency, and have timeframes that 
we can meet. We do all of that work in advance working with the 
committees.
    Mandates reinforce our nonpartisan, transparent reputation, 
because by definition, they are generally bicameral and 
direction for GAO work. It is the broadest expression of 
Congressional interest in our work. Also, the reports are 
released to the entire Congress and the public when they are 
ready to be released, as opposed to requests from Chairs and 
Ranking Members, who can hold the report up for 30 days before 
they release it.
    We are to the point now where we are doing more work as a 
result of mandates than requests from committees. I think the 
balance is good. So we built the demand from mandates into our 
request. And where we are receiving more of these mandates, or 
interests from the Congress, are in the four priority areas 
that I previously mentioned.
    Senator Reed. Mm-hmm.
    General Dodaro. Science and technology, national defense, 
health care, and cyber security. The number of cyber security 
requests and mandates has just proliferated as that issue has 
grown, and will continue to grow more complex. Those issues 
will not be resolved anytime soon, and they will become more 
complicated.
    Now, we also plan our work to get a good return on 
investment. And the work that we do on the high-risk areas--
where we designate areas that are susceptible to mismanagement, 
fraud, waste, and abuse issues that has returned, in the last 
17 years, $675 billion; so we get about $40 billion a year from 
targeting those areas where we know that there is waste, and 
abuse, and can be better management.
    The overlap, duplication, and fragmentation work, as I 
mentioned, is over a-half-trillion dollars in savings so far, 
and that is only with Congress implementing, and the 
administration, about 74 percent of our recommendations.
    Many of our unimplemented recommendations can yield tens of 
billions of dollars more. We will be updating the high-risk 
list next month before Congress, with hearings in both the 
House and Senate. We will also issue our next fragmentation, 
overlap, and duplication report, which includes opportunities 
for cost savings and revenue enhancements.
    Senator Reed. Mm-hmm.
    General Dodaro. The Inflation Reduction Act also directed 
that we provide oversight. We will do a lot of work at IRS 
examining the funding provided to the agency under the Act.
    I am confident we can continue to provide a good return on 
investment, help the Congress meet these national, pressing 
issues in these areas, and respond to all the mandates in a 
timely manner.
    Senator Reed. Thank you, Comptroller General.
    Director Halpern, your agency does very good work, we see 
the paper every day, and we are not disappointed. But can you 
highlight some of the improvements you intend to make, going 
forward, with this budget that you suggested?
    Mr. Halpern. Absolutely. I mentioned in my testimony XPub, 
our next-generation composition engine, and that bears a little 
bit of explanation.
    Senator Reed. Please.
    Mr. Halpern. So GPO built the software stack the Congress 
prints on, so every time you go to the Senate Office of 
Legislative Council, and they hit Control-P, our software takes 
over. The problem is that software was originally written in 
1982, and is still in use today. So every time Microsoft is 
helpful and upgrades Windows, it takes a lot of work, on our 
part, to make sure that our systems continue to function.
    But this is also an opportunity, and it is an opportunity 
to bring new technology that will speed up the process, and 
provide Congress with new options in a very cost-effective way. 
So XPub builds on the work that Congress has been doing over 
the last several decades, to build the legislative process 
around structured data. So instead of having a file that 
describes just how something looks, this is bold, this is small 
caps, or something along those lines; it is: No, this is a 
heading, this is text, this is a paragraph, this is a sub-
paragraph.
    Ad what that does is that enables, whether it is folks here 
in Congress, or folks out in the public, to build new software 
tools, to look at that data in new and different ways, ways 
that can help you understand what is going on, provide lots of 
links to GAO work, or CBO's work, or whatever.
    So updating our system to be an XML Native system, and 
improving the tools that we provide Congress to author things 
like committee reports, and hearings, and all of those kinds of 
things, will vastly cut down on the time it takes to prepare 
them, the complexity that is involved.
    You pair that with other Investments that we are making in 
digital inkjet press technology. So think of that digital 
inkjet printer that is sitting next to your desk, except it is 
the size of two panel bands.
    Senator Reed. Mm-hmm.
    Mr. Halpern. And we can literally print thousands of pages 
per minute. But that digital technology enables a whole host of 
other options for Congress. So for instance, you look at the 
report this Committee will put out on this bill, it is in small 
type, it is in a weird document size, and all of those things, 
that format was designed to cut down on costs in old-style 
offset printing.
    With digital inkjet technology, we are not constrained by 
that any longer. So we can make that report whatever size you 
want, we also have the ability to easily add graphics, easily 
add color, all of those kinds of things. So if you take XPub, 
and you take these other digital technologies and combine them, 
you are really at an inflection point for Congress to decide: 
How do we want our documents to look for the next, the next 
century?
    Senator Reed. Thank you very much. With your permission, 
may I ask one more question?
    Senator Fischer. Sure.
    Senator Reed. Thank you. Director Swagel, you know, you 
have brought up, and we have had a discussion about this, to 
the timeliness of response. Now, this is a: it takes two to 
tango.
    Dr. Swagel. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Reed. Sometimes we call you with a: We are ready to 
go at 1:00 a.m., and we would like to go at 2:00 o'clock that 
afternoon, we expect you to respond, correct?
    Dr. Swagel. It does happen once in a while.
    Senator Reed. It does happen once in a while.
    Dr. Swagel. Once in a while, yes.
    Senator Reed. So yes, this is not just the problems, but 
can you tell us what you are doing with this proposed budget to 
increase the timeliness of your response to Congressional 
requests.
    Dr. Swagel. Yes, sir. And that really is our focus. A 
couple of things. We have innovated in some ways; we are 
looking at bills that are reported out of committee to 
determine how we can do things faster, maybe not a full-blown 
cost estimate, but get them to the table they need to satisfy 
the budget requirements.
    And we have done that. We did that for Homeland Security 
last Congress and we will continue to do that when it is 
helpful to committees. We are doing that for bills. Regarding 
the House, it is bills coming on the suspension calendar. The 
same thing, we are doing a table with a group of those 
together.
    There is that sort of innovation too where things that are 
moving quickly that maybe we haven't seen to say, well, let us 
do what we need to do to get it on its way even if it is not 
our full-blown process. And then what the budget request will 
allow us to continue to do, is focus additional resources on 
the areas where we know we have fallen behind.
    And you and I have talked about National Security, Homeland 
Security, we just need more people. We have great people 
working on that, we just need more of them, and that is what I 
am hoping to add.
    Senator Reed. Thank you very much.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Dodaro, the GAO's fiscal year 2024 request proposes an 
increase to develop additional oversight capabilities in four 
key areas, which you have mentioned; that includes national 
security. In your written testimony you note that GAO seeks to 
expand assessments of individual defense programs in DOD's 
readiness posture. Can you please explain what specific 
elements of the request will serve to increase GAO's national 
security capacity, including conducting DOD assessments, and 
fulfilling the defense-related mandates that Congress has set 
for GAO?
    General Dodaro. Yes. A good portion of our existing 
resources are in the defense area, because it is half of the 
U.S. government's discretionary budget and the defense budget 
has been increasing. We see a lot of need for additional work 
in this area.
    Of the 165 additional FTE that our fiscal year 2024 budget 
would support, Senator Fischer, I would like to put 40 more 
people into the defense area. This would expand our teams that 
conduct work in this area and expand our capacity to do more 
work and make sure that we can meet the mandates in a timely 
fashion.
    Most of the mandates that are in the National Defense 
Authorization Act require us to report early in the next cycle 
for the next annual bill. And that timing can be a challenge. 
So sometimes we have to meet the required dates with a briefing 
rather than a full report being issued later. I am hoping, that 
with the additional resources, we can increase our ability to 
meet the mandated due dates with full reports, which would then 
allow us to take on other requests from Committee Chairs and 
Ranking Members across the Congress.
    As I mentioned, there are some critical areas that we are 
not going to be able to get to without additional resources. I 
think the recruitment and retention of our military personnel 
is one of those areas. The Army, I understand, reported that 
they missed their recruitment goals last year by 25 percent, 
and the Air Force just missed them by 10 percent or so. I would 
also like to do more work on the Guard and National Reserve 
readiness issues.
    Also, the Defense Department is spending a lot of resources 
on artificial intelligence, and I think they need to show good 
results in that area. We have developed an artificial 
intelligence accountability framework to help ensure that 
Federal agencies use AI responsibility. Using this framework, 
we can now audit agencies' algorithms and related AI systems to 
make sure that they are doing what they intend to do.
    And we have also tried to provide DOD more guidance to 
build in computer security requirements in the development of 
new weapon systems, which they weren't doing before. And so I 
would like to do more work in the cyber area, in artificial 
intelligence, and hypersonic weapons----
    Senator Fischer. Can you?
    General Dodaro. Yes.
    Senator Fischer. Since I am new here.
    General Dodaro. Yes.
    Senator Fischer. Can you tell me how, when you are looking 
for 40 more staff, what qualifications do they have to have? 
Not just with regards for defense.
    General Dodaro. Right.
    Senator Fischer. And you are mentioning things like 
``hypersonics'', and cyber----
    General Dodaro. Right.
    Senator Fischer [continuing]. And you talked about 
satellites. What do you look for in areas of expertise in order 
to have confidence in the numbers, in what they are proposing?
    General Dodaro. Oh, sure. In GAO we have both subject area 
and technical specialists. The subject area specialists tend to 
focus on a particular program or agency and have deep subject 
matter expertise and experience. For example, we have people 
that know the Defense Department inside and out and have been 
looking a defense issues for 20/30 years and have experience 
working with the different services.
    We also have technical specialists.
    We have scientists looking, for example, at the 
modernization of nuclear warheads. Among other subject matter 
experts, we have a PhD-level nuclear physicist on board to help 
with this work. Our teams are developed by putting together 
interdisciplinary teams. So we assemble teams with program 
experts like those with defense expertise, with technical 
specialists and others. We have so many program experts in 
defense, and then I have these scientists, people that are 
quantum experts, I have people that are biologists and----
    Senator Fischer. Do you ever reach out to the Department of 
Defense, and you know, not just ask questions but do you ever 
take information from them as well?
    General Dodaro. Oh, absolutely, yes. As part of auditing 
process, we get their views and information and documents from 
them, such as test plans. For example, every year we look at 
the Portfolio of Weapon Systems, to obtain information on cost 
and schedule performance. We have a very multidisciplinary 
workforce.
    Senator Fischer. That is helpful. Thank you.
    General Dodaro. Yes.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you.
    General Dodaro. Sure.
    Senator Fischer. Dr. Swagel, in your testimony, in your 
written testimony you mentioned that CBO's workload from 
Congress in 2022 strained the agency's resources in many areas. 
The fiscal year 2024 request seeks an 11.8 percent increase to 
improve capacity through hiring more staff and spending on new 
information technology systems. Can you elaborate on how the 
2022 legislative period strained CBO, and why the proposed 
increases are the correct answer to this problem?
    Dr. Swagel. Yes. And in a sense it was. Last Congress, 
there was both the regular work that we do for committees as 
they develop legislation in both Chambers then, in parallel 
there were legislative efforts, the larger more complex ones, 
that were largely outside of the committee process; the 
Omnibus, the two Reconciliation Bills, the CHIPS Act, the 
Infrastructure Bill, the Guns and Mental Health Bill. In 
substance, we are set up to work in regular order through the 
committees. We will work however the Congress works; we are 
just not set up for that. I think we managed, we innovatively 
managed. But I can see we just need more people.
    There is a part of it we are doing internally to make our 
people more flexible, and have overlapping portfolios, so we 
need to adjust inside. But I really think we just need to grow 
a bit to be able to handle that.
    Senator Fischer. As you are looking at adjusting what 
areas, issue areas, do you see Congress maybe turning to and 
focusing on that were in the near-term?
    Dr. Swagel. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Fischer. And how do you--how do you prepare for 
that?
    Dr. Swagel. Yes. We are at our best when we have our 
analysis done before; when we get to the issue before you do, 
and we do it sometimes. The Surprise Billing that was enacted a 
few years ago, we had our analysis ready, and so we did 
hundreds of iterations on that because we were ready.
    We are building capacity in some things, so I mentioned 
national security, we have capacity, we need more. Immigration, 
we say a lot, and I think excellent work, on the fiscal impacts 
of immigrants, but not on the wider impacts. What they do at 
the border, what they do inside the homeland, what they do for 
the economy, entrepreneurship. That is one area where I want to 
build our capacity. Health care is another. There are a couple 
of other topic areas where I am looking ahead thinking: Where 
will Congress go?
    Just one last sentence; on the near term, we are doing a 
lot on the sort of near-term spending; sort of what is going to 
happen in the near term on the budget. We are working very 
closely with the two budget committees and the two leaderships 
on that as well.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you.

                       HIRING QUALIFIED PERSONNEL

    Senator Reed. I just have a few brief questions; a question 
for everyone at the panel and beginning with the Comptroller 
General. One of the issues we hear consistently is the 
inability to hire qualified personnel throughout the economy of 
the United States, small businesses, large businesses, et 
cetera.
    Interestingly, today, we had a hearing where we had a 
nominee for manpower in the Department of Defense, and a 
nominee for Navy acquisition. It turned out, at the end, we 
discovered that they are competing against each other for 
personnel, shipyard workers versus, you know, sailors for the 
Navy. So I wonder if you are having that same problem.
    General Dodaro. No.
    Senator Reed. Great.
    General Dodaro. At GAO we have no problem. My entire time 
as Comptroller General, which now I have been in this position 
15 years, we have been ranked as one of the best places to work 
in the Federal Government.
    Senator Reed. Mm-hmm.
    General Dodaro. The last 2 years we have been number one 
across the entire Federal Government for mid-size agencies. We 
have a strong intern program, a nationwide recruiting program, 
we have a great mission, we provide people with flexibilities, 
and our work is used by the Congress. So people can actually 
see the results of their work, and they can work in a 
nonpartisan environment, and help the country.
    So we have no problems. We are on track to meet our 2023 
hiring plan. Our attrition is only about 6 percent, so we don't 
have a turnover problem, and people stay at GAO because they 
are satisfied with the work that they do.
    Senator Reed. All right then.
    Director Halpern.
    Mr. Halpern. Senator, you have hit on my number one 
challenge at GPO. So 50 percent of our team will be eligible to 
retire within the next 4 years. That means one out of every two 
press people, proofreaders, IT specialists, contract 
specialists, electricians, carpenters, book binders, you name 
it, our workforce tends to be a little older than the Federal 
average by three or 4 years.
    And attracting the kinds of folks who can do the crafts 
that we need at GPO is a challenge. So we have tried to respond 
to this in a number of different ways. One is, we have 
reactivated our Recent Grads Program where we are trying to 
recruit heavily from recent college grads. We, too, have been 
on Forbes' list of Best Places to Work, 2 years running now, 
something we are very proud of.
    And our first class, I want to say was 22 people this year. 
We expect to double that next year. We have also restarted our 
apprenticeship program, something that goes back 140 years, or 
so. Our first class was eight proofreaders, a particularly 
critical need for us. Next year we hope to up the 
apprenticeship class to 20 people across a whole variety of 
trades: press people, book binders, and the rest. We have also 
responded by creating new kinds of roles.
    So GPO is a heavily unionized institution. I have got 12 
different bargaining units I work with, and they have actually 
been a great partner throughout this. But we worked very 
closely with our book binder union to create what we call 
production technicians. So somebody who may not have training 
as a book binder, but shows some proficiency in machine and 
manufacturing operations, and we bring them in and we have a 3-
year, on-the-job training program.
    So at the end of that they are earning--they are a full-
fledged book binder, and they are earning probably about $44 an 
hour in today's dollars. So it is a--there are a lot of 
opportunities for young people. We are working hard to make 
sure we are recruiting out of high schools, and community 
colleges as well to try and fill that need.
    But you know, one of the reasons we are investing in 
technology is to cut down on the actual number of people we 
need, but we can't do it without replacing some of the folks we 
know are going to leave for their well-earned retirement.
    Senator Reed. Well, please keep us advised of that because 
it is--you know, it is a short horizon before you are in, so it 
is a significant issue.
    And Director Swagel, your comments on--could you get that 
microphone closer?
    Dr. Swagel. Oh. I have to push the button; sorry about 
that. We see it at both the macro and the micro level. At the 
macro level our budget analysis takes into account that there 
is over a million workers missing from the economy, and so that 
is affecting the economy and then it affects us at an agency 
level.
    Senator Reed. Mm-hmm.
    Dr. Swagel. And we hire people who are mission-oriented, 
people who want to give back and enter public service. We have 
been successful; we have to work at it, but we have been 
successful. We also have shifted to younger workers in that we 
have expanded the number we hire right out of college. Less 
experience of course, but they tend to be more flexible and 
that has been helpful.
    The challenge we face is given the age of our workforce, we 
hire people right after college; after a Master's, after a 
Ph.D. The really sort of chief years of fertility, of child 
rearing, and childcare. Administratively, we are part of the 
House, we are at the very bottom of the priority list for 
childcare in the House. And so that is one of the key 
challenges that CBO faces.
    Senator Reed. Well, that is something perhaps we might 
consider and work on.
    Senator Fischer.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you. Mr. Halpern, as part of the 
NDAA that passed Congress last December, the access to 
Congressionally Mandated Reports Act became law. GPO is now 
responsible for collecting and making publicly available all 
the congressionally mandated reports from Federal agencies in 
one central online portal.
    The fiscal year 2024 request seeks an increase of $500,000 
to develop the additional web system and contract support. Can 
you explain this new responsibility for the agency, and where 
you are in the process of implementing that?
    Mr. Halpern. Absolutely. So let me let me start before I 
came to GPO, when I was at Committee Council in the House. So I 
was responsible for all of the back office operations for the 
multiple committees I worked for, and one of those was handling 
these executive communications when they came in.
    And I will tell you exactly how it happened. The 
parliamentarians in the Speaker's Office would bundle them into 
an envelope, they would send them to us, we would put that 
envelope in a filing cabinet, and at the end of the Congress we 
would put it into a gray archive box, and send it off to the 
archives, with nobody ever having actually looked at them.
    If we fast forward to today, and the goal of the 
Congressionally Mandated Reports Act, it is to get some eyes on 
these reports, both here, inside the building, and externally 
amongst the public. The good news is, we have already got the 
infrastructure to support this. So GovInfo, the world's only 
ISO-certified, trusted digital repository, where all of your 
data is put online, and shared with our partners at the 
library, and at the archives, and the public, that provides 
sort of the bones that we need to build this system.
    The amount that we are requesting is for those custom 
elements that we are going to need to build, to put this in 
place. And the idea will be that these agencies will be able to 
submit these reports. We will work with them to provide 
standards for them to do that, and then provide both a PDF 
digital version of that, so it maintains that print fidelity, 
as well as a machine-readable format.
    And that is going to start out a little bit more simply; it 
is going to start out as more of a simple----
    Senator Fischer. What impact do you think this requirement 
is going to have on future budgets?
    Mr. Halpern. I am hopeful that it will not be huge; 
probably in that neighborhood of about half-a-million dollars a 
year. So we would like to get to the point where, in order to 
facilitate this for Federal agencies we build, essentially, a 
Word template. And we say: Here you go. You have got this 
requirement, if you use this Word template, we can provide you 
good, press-ready formatted material, and easily ingest that 
into a machine-readable format as well.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you, very much.
    Mr. Dodaro, the agency's budget request highlights the 
oversight of the Inflation Reduction Act, and that is going to 
be a central part of GAO's workload in the coming years, that 
includes 32 ongoing or planned audits through 2025, and there 
will be more in the future, as you know. How does the request 
align with this new workload? Are there any requested increases 
specific to the IRA oversight?
    General Dodaro. Our budget request will enable us to 
conduct the oversight envisioned in the IRA while also still 
meeting other demands for our services.
    In other words, our budget request primarily supports the 
costs of the people who are already on board. We need the funds 
requested to pay for the staff on board and those that we hire 
to replace those who we lose through attrition. The staff on 
board already the people who are going to work on the Inflation 
Reduction Act oversight. Plus, Congress already gave us $25 
million in the Inflation Reduction Act to provide support for 
this oversight. The people that we hire will backfill for the 
people that we allocate from our current workforce to timely 
conduct the IRA oversight.
    Senator Fischer. When you say, ``You are going to allocate 
people in your current workforce.''
    General Dodaro. Yes.
    Senator Fischer. Are you going to determine that a certain 
amount of their time is going to be geared toward the IRA? You 
are nodding, yes.
    General Dodaro. Yes. Yes.
    Senator Fischer. So if so, when you look at that, what is 
the percentage of--how much of their workload is going to be 
due to the IRA?
    General Dodaro. Well, it depends on which of the teams we 
need to draw people from. For example, a lot of the IRA funding 
is in the IRS area; there is the $80 billion for the IRS.
    Senator Fischer. Right.
    General Dodaro. And so we will have our of people who are 
experts in tax administration involved; a portion of their time 
will be devoted to IRA oversight. But we will hire people to 
backfill for those positions so we can continue to do other 
work in the tax administration area that we are mandated to do. 
We will do the same thing for the mandates related to rural 
development, for example; in those areas, we will allocate 
people in our natural resources and environment team that are 
subject matter experts. The same thing for the 
decarbonization----
    Senator Fischer. Right.
    General Dodaro [continuing]. Provisions. We will use some 
of our scientists for the work. So yes, for every audit that we 
do we pull people from four or five different teams.
    Senator Fischer. Right.
    General Dodaro. So it is hard to give you----
    Senator Fischer. Now, that will increase----
    General Dodaro. Yes.
    Senator Fischer [continued]: That you are pulling people 
off then to specifically address the IRA?
    General Dodaro. Yes.
    Senator Fischer. And how will GAO regularly report to 
Congress with its findings on the IRA oversight?
    General Dodaro. We will issue individual reports, and then 
like on our coronavirus oversight work where we were also 
mandated to do reports, we will send periodic reports to the 
Appropriation Committees to say how many reports we have issued 
already in these areas and what our work plans are. We will 
keep Congress apprised of our work plans going forward. But we 
will also report separately on all these different broad 
oversight mandates, such as the IRA and the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act. We have done this before with special 
funding for disaster-related assistance oversight.
    Senator Fischer. Okay. Thank you.
    General Dodaro. Sure.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Reed. Thank you, Senator Fischer.
    And gentlemen, thank you for your testimony, and for your 
service. And again, please compliment and commend all the 
people that do the job every day. So thank you very much.
    With that, unless you have additional questions?
    Senator Fischer. Mr. Chairman, could I follow up with some 
questions for the record, please?
    Senator Reed. Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you.

                     ADDITONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    Senator Reed. There, we allow, say, 4 days for questions 
for the record? I think you will probably have them in 
tomorrow, but anyway.
    [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but 
were submitted to the agencies for response subsequent to the 
hearing:]
    No questions were submitted for the record.

                          SUBCOMMITTEE RECESS

    Senator Reed. Thank you, gentlemen.
    And with, that I will adjourn the hearing.
    [Whereupon, at 3:58 p.m., Wednesday, March 15, the 
subcommittee was recessed, to reconvene subject to the call of 
the Chair.]



         LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2024

                              ----------                              


                       WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
           Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations,
                                                    Washington, DC.

    The subcommittee met at 3:00 p.m., in room SD-192, Dirksen 
Senate Office Building, Hon. Jack Reed (Chairman), presiding.
    Present: Senators Reed and Fischer.
                                ------                                


          ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL AND THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS

                 OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR JACK REED

    Senator Reed. Good afternoon. The subcommittee will come to 
order. I would like to welcome everyone to the second of our 
fiscal year 2024 budget hearings for the Legislative Branch 
Appropriations subcommittee.
    Today we have with us Dr. Carla Hayden, the Librarian of 
Congress, and Ms. Chere Rexroat, the Acting Architect of the 
Capitol. I would like to thank you for joining us here today to 
testify on your agency's fiscal year 2024 budget request, and I 
ask unanimous consent that the witnesses written testimony be 
placed in the hearing record.
    And hearing no objection, so ordered. As I noted in our 
first hearing last week, the Legislative Branch agencies have 
submitted fiscal year 2024 budget requests that account for 
$259 million increase over the fiscal year 2023 Legislative 
Branch appropriation.
    We will be carefully considering these requests to ensure 
they continue to improve our ability to meet our responsibility 
to govern effectively. For fiscal year 2024, the Library of 
Congress is requesting $895.1 million in appropriated funds, 
which is an increase of $66.6 million over the fiscal year 2023 
enacted level.
    This request includes $618.5 million for Library of 
Congress operations, $57.5 million in direct appropriations for 
the operations of the Copyright Office, $146.6 million for the 
operations of the Congressional Research Service, and $72.5 
million for the National Library Service for the Blind and 
Print Disabled.
    The Library of Congress's budget request includes funding 
for investments in the Library's IT and cloud infrastructure, 
as well as funds that can--efforts to modernize the Library's 
collections management systems and processes. Further, it 
requests funding for 40 positions to strengthen acquisition 
planning and contract management, and to strengthen the 
information technology planning and enterprise architecture 
management.
    The Library of Congress performs critical work that goes 
far beyond serving the Legislative Branch. I look forward to 
hearing from Dr. Hayden on the exceptional work of her agency 
to improve access to our Nation's treasures and library 
services for the American people, as well to hear about the 
agency's fiscal year 2024 budget request.
    Today, we will also be reviewing the Architect of the 
Capitol's fiscal year 2024 budget request. Before I address the 
AOC's request, I would like to thank Ms. Rexroat for stepping 
in to serve as the Acting Architect of the Capitol.
    She comes into this role following the removal of the 
previous Architect by the President, a movement both sides of 
the aisle had called for. This has been a tumultuous time for 
the men and women who work at the Architect of the Capitol.
    Please share our appreciation to your workforce for 
everything they do to keep the families and grounds and 
facilities of the Capitol complex operational each day. Each of 
them is critical to not only the ability of the Congress to 
fill Constitutional responsibility, but also for this 
institution to serve as a symbol of democracy around the world.
    Ms. Rexroat, you and I briefly discussed some of my 
concerns about the manner in which the AOC estimates the 
requirements for the significant properties your agency is 
responsible for and the way these projects are managed during 
execution.
    The Architect has a history of executing projects that do 
not meet estimated budgets or timelines, which result in 
significant budget implications affecting the Legislative 
Branch's overall budget.
    I appreciate your willingness to address these concerns 
head on, while a search for a new architect is underway, and to 
reform the way the AOC leadership administrate its 
responsibility to effectively lead your agency.
    I want you to know that I support any efforts to improve 
the AOC's internal operations and the effectiveness of the 
leadership team. The AOC is seeking an appropriation of $1.128 
billion, which is a decrease of $191 billion from fiscal year 
2023.
    While I appreciate that the AOC has submitted a reduced 
request over the fiscal year 2023 enacted level, my team has 
asked the Acting Architect to carefully review the requested 
funding levels for the projects included within this budget to 
ensure they promptly reflect the actual projected cost for the 
project.
    I look forward to receiving the Architect's updated 
information once these reviews are conducted, and I look 
forward to the Acting Architect's testimony today. Now, with 
that, let me turn it over to Ranking Member Senator Fisher.

                OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR DEB FISCHER

    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to 
our two witnesses today, Dr. Hayden and Ms. Rexroat, for being 
with us this afternoon for our second Legislative Branch 
hearing.
    As the Chairman noted in our last hearing, it is important 
to restore regular order in the appropriations process. The 
American people deserve a transparent and on time budget from 
their elected officials. It is my hope to craft a fiscally 
responsible bill with Chairman Reed through regular order this 
year.
    Today, as part of that process, we will be hearing from the 
librarian and also our Acting Architect as they testify 
regarding their agency's fiscal year 2024 budget request. Dr. 
Hayden. The Library of Congress does important work, not only 
in support of Congress, but on behalf of the American people.
    I want to commend you on the initiatives to expand access 
and increase engagement so that more people can benefit from 
the Library's collections. In particular, I want to highlight 
the Veterans History Project, the program that collects, 
preserves, and makes accessible the firsthand recollections of 
U.S. military veterans.
    Our veterans put their lives on the line in service to our 
Nation, and we have a responsibility to support and honor them. 
So, I am proud that my office has also helped to facilitate 
some of those recollections from Nebraska and our veterans to 
that project. For fiscal year 2024, the Library seeks a 7.5 
percent increase over last year's enacted level.
    In your testimony, I hope to hear how the increase will 
enable the Library to continue to expand access, modernize 
offerings, and provide research support for Congressional 
staff. Ms. Rexroat, I recognize that you are in an acting role 
as Architect of the Capitol, and I am hopeful that new 
leadership at the AOC will allow for fresh perspectives and 
improvements on the agency's processes and priorities.
    The AOC is asking for $1.1 billion, and while that is a 
decrease from the enacted level, it is still a significant 
request. As we look for fiscal year 2024, we must evaluate how 
the considerable resources we have provided over the past few 
years are being implemented. Additionally, we must ensure that 
projects are properly scoped on schedule and on budget.
    I am looking forward to your testimony on how this budget 
request will help the AOC meet its mission to serve Congress, 
preserve America's Capitol, and inspire memorable experiences. 
Thank you again to our witnesses for being here today. And 
thank you, Chairman Reed, for leading what I know will be a 
productive conversation on these agencies' budget requests.
    Senator Reed. Thank you very much, Senator Fischer. Dr. 
Hayden, your brief opening statement is now in order. As you 
know, your written testimony is already part of the record. Dr. 
Hayden, please.

                          LIBRARY OF CONGRESS

STATEMENT OF HON. CARLA HAYDEN, LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS, 
            LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
    Dr. Hayden. Chairman Reed and Ranking Member Fischer, thank 
you for this opportunity to testify in support of the Library's 
fiscal year 2024 budget. I am very pleased to report that in 
fiscal year 2022, the Library returned to regular operations.
    Visitors and researchers returned on site, reading rooms 
reopened, and in-person events multiplied, all while popular 
virtual programing continued. And with the support of Congress, 
the Library continued to build collections in multiple formats 
and engage users in a variety of ways.
    Today, the physical collections contained nearly 175 
million items, with many in digital form, and the Library's 
digital engagement has increased dramatically. I would like to 
express my support here and my gratitude for the support of 
Congress, in particular for funding our recent IT investments. 
Also, special thanks to Congress for support of the Visitor 
Experience Initiative.
    We have raised over almost $20 million from donors 
nationwide for this impactful initiative, and our goal is to 
have these engaging new spaces open in the Thomas Jefferson 
Building to the public for the Nation's celebration, 250-year 
celebration in 2026.
    I come before you to discuss the Library's fiscal year 2024 
appropriations request, and this request does include $45.8 
million in mandatory pay and price level increases, and the 
remaining increases represent critical investments necessary to 
continue to meet the Library's mission.
    With modern IT infrastructure and systems now in place, 
thanks to your support, we are using a continuous development 
approach to ensure ongoing improvements as we manage the 
Library's technology landscape.
    Several of the Library's requests this year include 
resources for congress.gov and to allow us to build capacity 
throughout all of our IT systems. For instance, the U.S. 
Copyright Office continues to reach major milestones toward a 
new enterprise copyright system, ECS, which is transforming the 
entire copyright process.
    The budget requests a permanent base for continuous 
development to the ECS to accommodate changing needs and 
technological advancements. The Library's special 
responsibility for the National Library for the Blind and Print 
Disabled extends to critical IT systems that ensure 
accessibility for NLS patrons and blind staff.
    The request includes staffing dedicated to continuous 
innovation and development for their systems, and other new 
funds would replace obsolete talking book machines with web-
based systems and make refresh of all braille e-readers 
available to patrons.
    In addition to the continuous development process that is 
led by Library staff, contracted services support a growing 
portion of our IT development. And to support the increase 
volume and complexity of these contracts, additional 
experienced staff are requested for the Library's contracts and 
grants director.
    Other important staffing requests will ensure that we 
continue the responsive service that Congress needs and 
expects. Given the significant increase in the annual volume 
and complexity of bills introduced, the Congressional Research 
Service requests funding for additional staff to accommodate 
the growing build digest workload and to enhance their 
Legislative Information Service support for Congress.
    This request also supports a series CRS pilot program for 
quantitative analysis of research and operation of big data to 
meet emerging Congressional demand. The Library's 2024 
Congressional budget justification advances necessary work 
initiated in previous years to move the Library forward, all 
while preserving its world class resources and making them 
accessible for generations to come.
    We recognize the challenges resulting from the current 
fiscal environment, and our programmatic requests represent the 
most necessary and impactful priorities that will enhance the 
Library service to Congress and the American people.
    Thank you again for supporting the Library and for your 
consideration of our fiscal 2024 budget, and I look forward to 
your questions.
    [The statement follows:]
  Prepared Statement of The Honorable Carla Hayden, The Librarian of 
                                Congress
Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Fischer, and Members of the Subcommittee:

    Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of 
the Library's fiscal 2024 budget request.
    The Library of Congress (Library) has built one of the largest 
collections of human knowledge ever assembled, in support of our 
mission to engage, inspire, and inform Congress and the American people 
with a universal and enduring source of information and creativity. In 
pursuit of its vision that all Americans are connected to the Library 
of Congress, the Library is committed to making this knowledge and 
creativity more discoverable, accessible, relevant, and useful.
    The Library is an authoritative source of knowledge that enriches 
the American people in countless ways. We serve many customers: 
Congress, Copyright users, researchers, visitors, and blind and print 
disabled citizens, among many others. We directly serve the American 
public with programs like the Veterans History Project that preserve 
and make accessible the firsthand recollections of U.S. military 
veterans, and Teaching with Primary Sources that allows teachers in 
local school districts to create curricula and develop apps using the 
Library's digitized primary sources. The Library is in the forefront of 
making its resources available and useful to those who come here and in 
digital form for those who cannot.
    In fiscal 2022, the Library returned to normal operations for the 
visiting public after building capacity limits and mask requirements 
were lifted in the third quarter. More visitors and researchers 
returned on site, reading rooms reopened and in-person events 
multiplied, while popular virtual programming that began during the 
pandemic continued. With the support of Congress, the Library continued 
to build collections in multiple formats and engage users in a variety 
of ways. Today, the physical collections contain nearly 175 million 
items, with many more in digital form.
    Robust service to Congress and all Americans continued across the 
Library. The Congressional Research Service's (CRS's) Congress.gov 
sites--the Constitution Annotated, CRS Reports and Congress.gov--drew 
40.8 million visits during the fiscal year. The U.S. Copyright Office 
(USCO) transferred 626,595 works, with an estimated value of nearly $48 
million, to the Library for possible addition to the collections. The 
Library's Center for Learning, Literacy and Engagement produced a year 
full of in-person and virtual programming, including the National Book 
Festival. At the end of fiscal 2022, new collections Module 6, 
completed in 2021, was 36 percent filled. Over the past year, the 
Library's Preservation Directorate performed 8.7 million preservation 
actions on books, serials, prints, photographs, manuscripts and other 
items.
    Notably, the Library's digital engagement increased dramatically 
since the start of the pandemic. In fiscal 2022, loc.gov recorded 392.4 
million page views during 105 million visits from 74 million unique 
users to National Library sites. On the Library's social media 
platforms, engagement has doubled and even tripled on Facebook, Twitter 
and Instagram, and Library YouTube content received 15.8 million views.
    I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the ongoing and 
remarkable support that this committee and all of Congress give to the 
Library. In particular, I appreciate the initial funding you have 
provided for major Information Technology (IT) investments that we are 
implementing and continuously improving to meet user expectations for 
greater access and new and enhanced tools. These investments include 
the Enterprise Copyright System (ECS); CRS's Integrated Research and 
Information System (IRIS); the National Library Service's Braille Audio 
Reading by Download (BARD) and next generation devices; the Library 
Collections Access Platform (L-CAP); Congress.gov; and the Library's 
core IT infrastructure and IT security.
    I would also like to give special thanks for your support of the 
Library's Visitor Experience initiative over the last 4 years. We are 
working closely with the Architect of the Capitol on final designs, and 
construction is expected to be underway by the end of the fiscal year. 
Our goal is to have our engaging new gallery spaces open to the public 
for the nation's semiquincentennial, in 2026. Further, in addition to 
the funds appropriated by Congress, we are close to having raised $20 
million in private donations for this effort. It is a testament to the 
Library's public engagement and offerings that donors large and small 
from across the country are contributing to this impactful initiative 
that will ultimately provide significant value for Congress and its 
constituents.
    I come before you today to discuss the Library's fiscal 2024 
appropriations request of $940.8 million, which represents a 7.5 
percent increase over the Library's fiscal 2023 enacted appropriation, 
including $45.8 million in mandatory pay and price level increases. The 
budget request reflects the resources needed to sustain the Library's 
mission of service to Congress and the American people, and its vision-
driven efforts to make the Library more user centered, digitally 
enabled, and data driven. It builds on multiyear strategic efforts to 
stabilize and optimize advanced IT systems and business processes, 
while at the same time enhancing access and customer services. And it 
invests in the future, ensuring that the Library can safeguard and 
support its collections, services, and workforce in person and online.
    The budget request is carefully aligned with the goals and 
objectives of the Library's Strategic Plan: to expand access, enhance 
services, optimize resources, and measure impact. Requests for 
additional resources to support new or expanded programs are grouped in 
three interconnected and mutually reinforcing areas: (1) sustaining 
continuous technology development; (2) enhancing services and expanding 
access; and (3) strengthening expertise in other key areas.
    With the understanding that mandatory pay increases and the effects 
of inflation on the cost of materials and services we procure are 
driving 70 percent of our fiscal 2024 request, we have taken great care 
to make only programmatic requests that are necessary and have the 
greatest impact on our service to Congress and the American people. We 
understand the current fiscal environment and the challenge you face in 
trying to meet the needs of the Library of Congress while being mindful 
of the taxpayer.
              sustaining continuous technology development
    Recognizing that technology is essential to its mission of 
engaging, inspiring, and informing Congress and the American people 
with an enduring source of knowledge and creativity, the Library has 
adopted a continuous development model to sustainably evolve business 
operations and digital offerings. This approach integrates IT 
innovation, design, and delivery efforts to manage the increasingly 
complex technology landscape, reduce risk, and sustain digital 
transformation. Following industry best practices, and recommendations 
from the Government Accountability Office and the Library's Office of 
the Inspector General, the Library's continuous development approach 
ensures major IT investments are continuously improved in incremental, 
manageable steps, to meet user expectations for greater access and new 
and enhanced tools. The requested funding and staffing will bolster the 
Library's ability to sustain continuous development efforts, keep pace 
with digital advancement, and ensure that technology can continue to be 
harnessed to deliver exceptional services to all Library users.
USCO Enterprise Copyright System--Technology Transformation
    The USCO continues to reach major milestones in developing the new 
Enterprise Copyright System (ECS), a transformative technological 
investment. The once paper-based Copyright Recordation process is now 
online, and the new Copyright Public Records system is now in 
operation. By 2024, ECS Recordation, ECS Public Records, ECS Licensing, 
and ECS Service Requests will be in full public use. Additional ECS 
applications will be available to the public in fiscal 2025, with the 
ECS Registration system planned to go live in fiscal 2026.
    The budget requests a permanent base for continuous development of 
the ECS. Requested funding will bring in new staff and sustain a number 
of existing staff to implement a collaborative USCO/Office of the Chief 
Information Officer (OCIO) continuous development program that will 
sustain and keep ECS and other systems up-to-date with new features, 
enhancements and applications. It will also increase the functionality 
of ECS core services and add new services. Building an innovative ECS 
not only meets the expectations of today's copyright users, but also 
can accommodate changing needs and technological advances thanks to the 
continuous development approach. Sustained investment is essential for 
our long-term success in meeting the needs of the copyright community.
NLS--Technology and Service Delivery
    Congressional investment in the National Library Service for the 
Blind and Print Disabled's (NLS's) efforts to modernize its business 
practices and associated IT systems, implement digital braille 
delivery, and develop cost-effective digital content delivery to new 
devices has resulted in important improvements for NLS patrons. To meet 
the evolving needs and expectations of its expanding patron base, NLS 
developed and piloted next generation devices, including DA2 (Digital 
Advanced Player 2), a web-based wireless system that replaces the 
original digital talking-book machine, which is an end-of-life product 
based on 20-year-old technology, and the eReader, a refreshable braille 
device that is in growing demand. Both the digital talking-book machine 
and eReader devices connect to the BARD Braille and audio download 
service. Requested funding will significantly increase the reach of 
these popular devices, making available 145,000 DA2 devices and 4,000 
eReader devices to blind and print disabled patrons over a five-year 
period.
    As an outgrowth of technology modernization, today, NLS is 
critically dependent on 19 IT systems for content delivery, content 
production, library services, marketing and communications, customer 
service, and project and program management. Consistent with NLS's 
mission, these systems must always provide the highest level of 
accessibility to NLS patrons and blind staff, and must allow these 
staff to be as productive as sighted persons when using them. Requested 
funding includes staffing in NLS and the OCIO dedicated to continuous 
development for NLS systems that will enhance efficiency and improve 
access to services for the growing population of blind and print 
disabled Americans. Again, sustained investment is essential for our 
long-term success.
                     enhancing services and access
Legislative Support--CRS Bill Summaries, Congress.gov, and Quantitative 
        ``Big Data'' Analysis
    CRS has experienced greater demand for CRS Bill Summaries, one of 
its most widely used products, thanks in part to technological 
advancements that have resulted in new applications to automate the 
functions for Members to introduce bills. The volume of bills has 
increased by about one-third since the 115th Congress. Although CRS 
took extraordinary measures to keep pace with the volume and increased 
complexity of incoming bills, such as significantly shortening the 
length of bill summaries, a bill summary backlog of over 2,400 items 
remains. The request includes funding for additional staff with subject 
matter expertise to support CRS Bill Summaries and other analytical 
products created by the Legislative Information Services team, which 
makes searchable content available to congressional and public users of 
Congress.gov.
    The request also seeks additional staff to enhance support for 
Congress and to create a permanent capacity for continuous development 
for Congress.gov. Increased staffing will ensure the day-to-day data 
integrity of the system and provide congressional operational support 
to include continuous modernization of congressional collections, 
formats, and capabilities, as well as support of congressional access 
to emerging application programming interfaces.
    Lastly, to meet emerging demand, the budget additionally requests 
funding for a pilot program to augment and enhance CRS's ability to 
perform quantitative analysis of both research and operational ``big 
data'' for congressional clients. The request includes staffing to 
strengthen existing capabilities and an investment in the tools and 
datasets required to broaden the depth of quantitative analysis and 
models by leveraging big data. This program investment will establish a 
base process and increased capacity for in-depth data analysis in CRS.
                  strengthening expertise in key areas
Contracts and Grants--Support for IT and Other Acquisitions
    The request includes additional staffing for the Library's 
Contracts and Grants Directorate to keep pace with increasing demands 
for contracted products and services for everything from new collection 
display cases to major IT systems. The Library, like other Federal 
agencies, is facing substantial attrition of its contracting staff as 
workloads increase and contracts become more complex, particularly for 
IT-related acquisitions. These are hard-to-fill positions and a 
government-wide shortage of contract specialists makes recruitment and 
retention even more challenging. The requested funds will also acquire 
a Web-enabled solution for the grants lifecycle to support the 
application, award, and management processes.
OCIO--Enterprise Architecture and Digital Accessibility
    The Library requests funding to establish a Digital Accessibility 
program within OCIO to meet growing demands for accessibility services 
including consultation, compliance assessment, and remediation and to 
improve access to the Library's digital products, materials, and 
services for Americans with disabilities. Direct patron and staff 
feedback, along with preliminary expert assessments, point to a large 
gap between the Library's products, materials, and services and 
Federal/international accessibility standards. The Library seeks to 
expand the program within OCIO so that accessibility is addressed at 
the beginning of the software development cycle while also enhancing 
current digital products.
    The Library also requests funding to strengthen its Enterprise 
Architecture Program Office (EAPO) given the increasing complexity of 
the Library's IT programs and portfolios, together with a rapidly 
growing demand for new and enhanced user tools and technology 
solutions. The budget requests funding and staff to increase EAPO's 
capacity to produce complex architectural artifacts such as 
technological roadmaps and solution overviews, and to support robust 
strategic IT planning with detailed technology solution proposals that 
include accurate project cost and schedule estimations.
    In closing, the Library's fiscal 2024 Congressional Budget 
Justification advances necessary work begun in previous years to move 
the Library forward into the future in an enduring way that preserves 
its resources, unrivaled anywhere else in the world, and makes them 
accessible for those who will come after us, as technological change 
accelerates. We recognize the challenges resulting from the current 
fiscal environment, and these programmatic requests represent the most 
necessary and impactful priorities that will enhance the Library's 
service to Congress and the American people.
    Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Fischer, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you again for supporting the Library of Congress 
and for your consideration of our fiscal 2024 budget request.

                                 ______
                                 
  Prepared Statement of Shira Perlmutter, Register of Copyrights and 
                    Director, U.S. Copyright Office
Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Fischer, and Members of the Subcommittee:

    Thank you for the opportunity to submit the United States Copyright 
Office's fiscal 2024 budget request. The Copyright Office is tasked 
with overseeing the national copyright registration and recordation 
systems, advising Congress on copyright policy and legislation, working 
with the Department of Justice and other Federal agencies on copyright 
litigation and international copyright matters, conducting 
administrative and regulatory activity including with respect to 
statutory licenses, and educating the public about copyright. We 
accomplish this with a talented and diverse staff of about 450 people, 
all dedicated to copyright's Constitutional mission of ``promot[ing] 
the progress of science and useful arts.''\1\
                 key accomplishments over the past year
    The Copyright Office has achieved many noteworthy successes over 
the past year, and has fully restored on-site operations.
Registration and Recordation
    The Office continues to effectively administer the national 
copyright registration and recordation systems. We have eliminated the 
backup of physical deposits caused by the pandemic and have markedly 
improved registration processing times: the average for examining all 
copyright claims stands at 2.7 months for the second half of fiscal 
2022, and for fully electronic claims that do not require 
correspondence, the average is down to just 1.2 months.\2\ While the 
pandemic temporarily impacted processing times for electronic 
applications with physical deposits as well as for paper applications, 
we have reduced these timeframes to an average of 6.5 months and 6.1 
months, respectively. With respect to recordation, in fiscal 2022 the 
Office recorded 14,714 documents containing titles of 1,165,653 
works.\3\ Our online recordation pilot, opened to the general public in 
August 2022 now offers an alternative to the older paper-based process, 
and has shortened processing times from months to weeks.
Other Activities
    The Office continued its longstanding roles of providing advice to 
Congress and the courts, and information to the public. In fiscal 2022, 
we launched the Copyright Claims Board (described below). We responded 
to numerous requests from Congress on topics ranging from music 
licensing issues to the effectiveness of copyright protection for press 
publishers, the feasibility and advisability of creating a deferred 
examination option for copyright registration, and technical measures 
used to identify or protect copyrighted works. We initiated a study on 
non-fungible tokens and intellectual property jointly with the U.S. 
Patent and Trademark Office. And after completing implementation of the 
Music Modernization Act (MMA) in 2021, we maintain an oversight role as 
directed by the statute and the legislative history, as well as 
engaging in education and outreach activities. The Office also provided 
legal advice and assistance across the government, including on 
litigation and international trade.
    The Office maintained our effective stewardship of over $1.2 
billion in statutory licensing revenues as of the end of fiscal 2022. 
We also engaged in numerous outreach activities; in fiscal 2022, we 
hosted 47 public events and spoke at over 100 more, roughly double the 
prior year. The Office transferred 573,152 works with an estimated 
value of $45 million to the Library collections. We hired our first 
ever Chief Economist and released a report on women authors' 
participation in the copyright system.
                    significant ongoing initiatives
    Below we highlight progress on two particularly important 
initiatives: IT continuous development and the Copyright Claims Board 
(CCB).
Continuous Development
    Working with the Library of Congress's Office of the Chief 
Information Officer (OCIO), we have completed the fourth year of the 
appropriated five-year funding (fiscal 2019--2023) for modernization of 
our IT systems. The planned Enterprise Copyright System (ECS) includes 
major workstreams on recordation, public records, registration, and 
licensing.
    Recordation.--Our new recordation system was the first ECS 
component to be released to the public, enabling electronic recordation 
of documents under section 205 of title 17. We are now incorporating 
user feedback to make iterative improvements as well as to build the 
functionality to process notices of termination. We anticipate the 
recordation component will move into continuous development in fiscal 
2024.
    Public Records.--Our second ECS application to be publicly released 
was a pilot for the new Copyright Public Records System (CPRS). This 
system provides an improved interface for our public records, along 
with advanced search functionality. We anticipate that this component 
too will move into continuous development in fiscal 2024.
    Registration.--Registration is the most complex of the Office's 
services and there is a lot of public interest in the success of the 
ECS registration component. We have made considerable progress on both 
the external (public) and internal (staff) sides. With continued 
support, we aim to have the standard registration application in a 
limited pilot by the end of calendar 2024. We then hope to expand to 
group registrations and ultimately retire the legacy eCO system by the 
end of calendar 2026. We are working with OCIO to increase the 
resources devoted to registration, in order to attain the pace needed 
to achieve these goals.
    Licensing.--The Office has been developing user experience design 
and initial automated workflows for licensing processes to replace 
outdated systems. We are focusing on migrating the statement of account 
examination process to ECS and migrating all royalty accounting 
processes to the Legislative Branch Financial Management System. The 
new licensing component will move into continuous development in spring 
2024.
    Historical Public Records.--As part of the Office's commitment to 
providing access to our historical records, we are digitizing print and 
microfilm records and making them available online. This includes the 
card catalog,\4\ the Catalog of Copyright Entries (CCEs), and the 
record books. Digitization will be followed by metadata capture for 
searchability, with all records eventually available through the new 
CPRS. Considerable progress has been made this year with respect to the 
record books, which contain well over 26 million pages of records 
between 1870 and 1977. The first 500 books were digitized and published 
on the Library's website in February 2022,\5\ and now over 5,600 are 
available.
    Warehouse Consolidation.--The Office has almost finished 
consolidating copyright deposit materials and other stored records from 
several geographically dispersed storage facilities into a single, 
modern facility in Landover, Maryland. This will allow us to provide 
faster location services, better tracking, and improved security.
    Contact Center.--The Office's work to modernize call routing and 
reporting continued in fiscal 2022, with a contract to develop a state-
of-the-art contact center awarded in September 2022 through the GSA 
Centers of Excellence program.
Launching the Copyright Claims Board
    The groundbreaking copyright small claims tribunal, the CCB, opened 
its doors to the public on June 16, 2022.\6\ Within the tight statutory 
timeframe set by the CASE Act, we completed extensive regulatory work, 
hired the officers and other staff, and collaborated with other Library 
service units to prepare an electronic case management system (eCCB), 
virtual hearing facilities, and office space. As of March 15, 2023, 
over 380 claims have been filed and are now being processed, and we 
continue our efforts to inform and educate the public about the 
existence and operations of the CCB.
            funding and fiscal update to 2024 budget request
    Current financial support for our modernization initiative, 
initially funded as part of the fiscal 2019 budget, continues through 
fiscal 2024. Additional support will be needed as the Office begins to 
maintain the ECS in order to avoid repeating the overhaul of severely 
outdated legacy systems.
    For fiscal 2024, the Office requests an overall budget of $103.1 
million in funding and 481 full time employees (FTEs), of which $45.6 
million would be funded through offsetting fees collected in fiscal 
2022 and prior years. Specifically, in conjunction with OCIO, we 
request $7.220 million in additional fiscal 2024 funding to support 
software development and provide capacity for continuous development of 
ECS, including 16 FTEs. Thirteen of these would be used to convert 
current temporary OCIO employees to full-time staff; the other three 
would serve in the Copyright Office. Our requests are as follows:

  --Basic Budget\7\: $93.0 million and 448 FTEs, comprising $38 million 
        in offsetting fee collections (41%) and $55 million (59%) in 
        appropriated dollars. The request includes mandatory pay-
        related and price level increases of $4.347 million, and one 
        program increase of $4.323 million for mission-critical 
        Copyright Office Information Technology Continuous Development. 
        The $4.323 million request will provide essential investment 
        and ongoing funding needed to develop , test, and integrate 
        multiple ECS applications with related systems and ensure they 
        are kept up-to-date. This shared program increase requires a 
        total of $7.220 million, $4.323 million and 3 FTE for Copyright 
        and $2.897 million and 13 FTE for OCIO. Notably, the Office's 
        portion of this request would be supported through sustained 
        funding and is a minor increase in offsetting collections 
        authority; it will not require an increase in appropriated 
        funds.
  --Licensing Division Budget\8\: $6.9 million and 26 FTEs, all to be 
        funded via filing and royalty fees. The requested increase is 
        to cover mandatory pay-related and price level increases of 
        $0.327 million.
  --Copyright Royalty Judges Budget\9\: $3.2 million and 7 FTEs, with 
        $0.2 million to support mandatory pay-related and price level 
        increases. Of this total, royalties and participation fees 
        offset $0.603 million (for non-personnel-related expenses). The 
        remainder, $2.590 million in appropriated dollars, is to cover 
        the personnel and other related expenses of the three judges 
        and their staff.

    The Copyright Office appreciates the Subcommittee's and Committee's 
continued support of our work to promote and improve the copyright 
system, including the critically important continuous development of 
the ECS to benefit all users.

    \1\ U.S. CONST. art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 8.
    \2\ Registration processing times are posted at https://
copyright.gov/registration/docs/processing-times-faqs.pdf. For the 
April 1 to September 30, 2022 timeframe, 81% of all registration claims 
were eService claims (online claims and electronic deposits); about 17% 
were deposit ticket claims (online claims with separately mailed 
physical deposit materials); and about 2% were mail claims (paper claim 
forms and physical deposits).
    \3\ There are three primary types of documents that may be 
submitted for recordation: transfers of copyright ownership, other 
documents pertaining to a copyright, and notices of termination. The 
pilot and newly released system are currently focused on only the first 
category (section 205 documents).

    \9\ Although the CRJ program is not part of the Office, we provide 
it with budget formulation and execution support on behalf of the 
Library. Appropriated funding supports payroll and partially funds non-
pay expenses that are not funded by fees and royalty payments.

Prepared Statement of Mary B. Mazanec, Director, Congressional Research 
                                Service
Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Fischer, and Members of the Subcommittee:

    Thank you for the opportunity to present the fiscal 2024 budget 
request for the Congressional Research Service (CRS). I would also like 
to express my appreciation to the Committee for your support of our 
fiscal 2023 request.
    With today's testimony, I outline CRS's budget requirements for 
fiscal 2024, including two proposed programmatic increases that will 
bolster the Service's analytic capabilities and enhance the level of 
service provided to Congress. In addition, I will provide an overview 
of several noteworthy CRS accomplishments in its support for Congress 
during fiscal 2022, and update you on the Service's progress on a 
number of our strategic initiatives.
            fiscal 2024 budget request and program increases
    The CRS budget request for fiscal 2024 is 146.574 million dollars, 
an increase of 12.974 million dollars (or 9.7 percent) over the amount 
appropriated for fiscal 2023. The requested increase includes 7.71 
million dollars for mandatory pay and price increases. The proposal 
also includes program increases of 5.264 million dollars to build 
analytical capacity for CRS's bill digesting services, to support the 
continued development of Congress.gov, and to enhance the Service's 
quantitative analysis capabilities. As in previous fiscal years, staff 
pay and benefits account for approximately 90 percent of the amount 
requested by CRS.
Increased Capacity for Bill Summaries and Congress.gov
    As part of its proposed program increase, CRS is requesting 2.671 
million dollars and 16 FTE to address a backlog of legislative 
summaries and to continue development of Congress.gov. The publication 
of bill summaries is a function mandated in CRS's authorizing statute 
and is a critical component of the searchable content on the 
Congess.gov website. Due to an increase in the volume of bills 
introduced, the growing complexity of legislative proposals, along with 
inadequate staff capacity within the Legislative Information Services 
(LIS) Bill Digesting team, there is a backlog of bills requiring 
summarization. At present, a single LIS analyst serves as the sole 
subject matter expert for a subject area and each analyst is 
responsible for multiple areas. This ``one-deep'' staffing 
configuration has proven problematic and is insufficient to keep pace 
with the rapid legislative activity occurring over the most recent 
Congresses.
    Twelve (12) additional FTEs will allow CRS to create needed 
redundancies in subject area coverage to better respond to competing 
priorities and spikes in workload; to more efficiently distribute and 
manage the workload of incoming bills; and to improve the depth of 
expertise necessary to authoritatively analyze and summarize complex 
legislation proposed by the modern-day Congress. In requesting these 
new hires, CRS's objective is to remedy the existing backlog and 
improve the overall timeliness of bill summary publication.
    In addition to addressing the backlog, CRS's request includes 4 
FTEs to support the continuous development and day-to-day operation of 
Congress.gov. LIS staff work in close concert with congressional staff 
and the Library's OCIO on the modernization of congressional 
collections, formats, and capabilities for Congress.gov. The additional 
FTEs will be vital to sustain these enhancements as well as ensuring 
the day to day integrity of the Congress.gov system.
Quantitative Data Analysis Pilot
    CRS's requested program increase for fiscal 2024 includes 3.080 
million dollars and 2 NTE to pilot and enhance the Service's capability 
for quantitative data analysis and policy simulation. In the Joint 
Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
2023, Congress encouraged CRS ``to explore ways to expand its ability 
to perform quantitative analysis of research data . . . .'' and 
directed the Service to ``engage with an external entity to produce a 
report detailing the feasibility of CRS engaging in the analysis and 
modeling of big data sets by highlighting the information technology 
infrastructure, staffing, and analytical support required to establish 
and maintain such a capability.'' This report language reflects the 
growing demand among Members and Committees for this type of analytical 
support from CRS. While CRS has conducted limited quantitative analysis 
and policy simulation to evaluate the effects of legislation, it lacks 
the capacity to provide this service on a broader scale. Enhancing this 
area would enable CRS to provide congressional requestors with a more 
granular perspective of the impact of legislative proposals on various 
demographic groups, as well as the interaction of such policies with 
other programs.
    CRS would utilize 2.593 million dollars of the requested amount to 
contract personnel (data scientists, programmers, and digital interface 
designers) to process data and maintain simulation models in a cloud 
computing environment. The funds would also be used to invest in the 
software, data sets, and infrastructure required to perform and 
maintain the data analysis and policy simulations. An additional 487 
thousand dollars is requested for OCIO to hire 2 NTE to design, support 
and implement systems, and to contract for IT security services. The 
entire 3.080 million dollars requested for this pilot will non-recur in 
fiscal 2028.
                          service to congress
    As in previous years, CRS provided support to almost every Member 
and Committee office. In fiscal 2022, CRS experts responded to over 
73,000 congressional requests; prepared nearly 1,100 new products; 
updated over 1,900 existing products; and conducted 264 seminars that 
were attended by approximately 10,000 congressional participants. In 
addition, CRS information specialists completed over 200 Geographical 
Information System (GIS) projects. The Service also produced 86 videos 
and podcasts featuring discussions by CRS analysts and legislative 
attorneys covering a myriad of topics including: defense and 
intelligence; homeland security and emergency management; science and 
technology; and healthcare.
    CRS supported Congress during every stage of the legislative 
process and across a range of issues including China's global 
ambitions, policies and activities; border security; climate change; 
cybersecurity; constitutional law, international trade and finance, and 
the conflict in Ukraine. CRS experts worked closely with Congress on 
issues presented in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the CHIPS and 
Science Act, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023.
                         strategic initiatives
    CRS is committed to achieving the goals and objectives included in 
its 2019-2023 Directional Plan. In addition, the Service is developing 
its next Directional Plan (FY2024-2028) in coordination with the 
Library's strategic planning effort. CRS's priorities for fiscal 2024 
include execution of the Continuing Legal Education Forum (CLEF); 
continuing to work with OCIO to modernize its IT infrastructure; and 
strengthening the diversity and inclusiveness of the CRS workforce and 
working environment. Of course, CRS's primary focus will remain the 
efficient delivery of its core products and services to support the 
118th Congress. The following is a summary of the Service's progress 
during fiscal 2022 in advancing key initiatives.
IT Modernization/Integrated Research and Information Systems (IRIS)
    The Integrated Research and Information System (IRIS) initiative is 
a multi-year effort to update the Service's mission-specific 
information technology to enable CRS staff to create and deliver 
products and services to Congress. During fiscal 2022 CRS, in 
collaboration with LC OCIO, continued several major work streams 
including Authoring System; Content Management; CRS.gov website 
redesign; as well as the Text Analysis Program (TAP), CRS's legislative 
analysis application. The selected solutions align with the Library's 
technical roadmap and Legislative Branch cloud strategies. Solutions 
are developed using an agile framework, permitting stakeholders to 
incrementally validate the solution during the development phase, 
ensuring the delivered product meets all defined requirements. 
Solutions are informed by both internal CRS staff as well as our 
congressional stakeholders. These efforts are essential to modernizing 
CRS mission critical applications to achieve the Library's ``digital 
first'' strategy and meet the evolving needs of Congress. CRS 
anticipates releasing both the Authoring and Document Management 
solution as well as the TAP solution into production in fiscal 2023.
(CONAN) Modernization
    Known officially as the ``Constitution of the United States of 
America: Analysis and Interpretation,'' CONAN serves as the official 
record of the U.S. Constitution for Congress. In 2019, CRS collaborated 
with OCIO and the Law Library to introduce a new website for CONAN: 
constitution.congress.gov. The new site features hundreds of pages of 
updated constitutional analysis and content. Since the launch of the 
public website in 2019, CONAN has received over fourteen million unique 
visitors to the site and its pages have been viewed over thirty-five 
million times. During fiscal 2022, CRS legislative attorneys continued 
to provide comprehensive analysis of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence 
as it relates to every provision of the U.S. Constitution, including 
the implications of recently decided cases. To make CONAN more 
accessible to online users, new and existing content has been drafted 
and revised in the form of short, granular essays that focus on 
specific, discrete topics. CRS legal experts have also been preparing 
the print decennial 2022 edition of CONAN. Covering Supreme Court 
interpretations of the Constitution through the Court's October 2021 
term, the decennial 2022 edition features a revised format designed to 
integrate the print version of CONAN with its digital counterpart.
Recruitment and Retention of a Diverse and Productive Workforce
    CRS continues to recruit, retain, and professionally develop a 
diverse, highly skilled workforce. Specific goals for diversity and 
inclusion are identified in the CRS Operations Plan around recruitment, 
training, and communications. Updates on diversity and inclusion 
efforts are communicated to staff from leadership, in CRS's staff 
newsletter, and it's newly developed internal Diversity and Inclusion 
website.
    The Service has developed and executed a recruitment plan for merit 
selection positions that includes outreach to potential applicants from 
underrepresented groups. During fiscal 2022, CRS participated in over 
30 recruitment events many of which were sponsored by minority-serving 
institutions with a focus on underrepresented groups and has 
participated in 8 events thus far in fiscal 2023. The Service also 
supported a variety of paid summer internships through the Student 
Diversity and Inclusion Internship Program. In fiscal 2022, CRS 
completed its capstone project with Texas A&M University's Bush School 
of Government to research strategies for improving the recruitment and 
retention of a diverse workforce. CRS is in the process of reviewing 
and implementing the capstone recommendations. Additionally, CRS is 
actively engaged with other Library offices to conduct a barrier 
analysis focused on the CRS workforce.
    CRS hosted a number of programs for staff that were aimed at 
fostering a more inclusive and respectful workplace including ``Leaving 
the Door Open for Inclusion;'' ``Generational Diversity;'' and ``Anti-
Harassment Training.'' In addition, the Service continues to offer 
training opportunities for leadership, writing, and presentation skills 
and has developed customized statistics and data training courses to 
support professional development.
Knowledge Management
    CRS is developing and implementing strategies to capture and 
preserve the institutional knowledge that it relies on to provide 
exceptional service to Congress. The Service utilizes its Research 
Portal as a hub for digital resources for quick and easy access to 
information needed to research and analyze legislative issues. The 
Research Portal was particularly useful during the COVID-19 pandemic 
when most CRS staff were working remotely, and its utility has 
continued since the resumption of onsite operations. By the end of 
fiscal 2022, four additional sites were added to bring the total number 
of collections on the Portal to 46. In addition, CRS continued to 
capture and transfer tacit knowledge held by senior analysts, 
attorneys, and information professionals. Activities to facilitate the 
sharing of information, knowledge, and best practices have enabled new 
staff to learn from the experience of their colleagues. The Service 
also continued to implement its information resource instructional 
program, which provides staff with best practices on training 
techniques such as adult learning and virtual instruction, to enrich 
the learning experience of congressional patrons.
Congress.gov
    CRS partnered with OCIO to actively engage with the House Clerk and 
Secretary of the Senate data partners to modernize legislative data 
interchanges. Targeted to be completed by the end of fiscal 2023, 
replacing legacy data processing workflows with new data interchanges 
will better safeguard congressional data and enable potential future 
enhancements. Fiscal 2022 enhancements to Congress.gov that have 
improved access to accurate and timely legislative information include: 
the release of the beta Application Programming Interface (API) that 
enables direct access to structured Congress.gov legislative and 
congressional data; and customizable data elements for downloading, as 
well as increasing the download limit to 5,000 rows from 1,000. 
Additional enhancements included automated appropriations measure 
searches by specific fiscal years and an alerts capability available 
for appropriations measures considered by Congress. CRS and its Library 
colleagues continue to be appreciative of the ongoing high-performing 
partnerships with House, Senate, and GPO colleagues as legislative data 
workflows, tools, and standards continue to be modernized through 
collaborative efforts.
                               conclusion
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Fischer, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, the requested budget resources reflect CRS's ongoing 
commitment to meet the important responsibility that Congress has 
entrusted to it and to do so as comprehensively and efficiently as 
possible. On behalf of my colleagues at CRS, I would like to thank the 
Committee for your support and consideration of our fiscal 2024 
request.

    Senator Reed. Thank you, Dr. Hayden. Acting Architect 
Rexroat, please.
                                ------                                


                        ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL

STATEMENT OF CHERE REXROAT, ACTING ARCHITECT OF THE 
            CAPITOL, ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL
    Ms. Rexroat. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Reed, 
and Ranking Member Fischer, and Members of the subcommittee. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in the 
Architect of the Capitol's fiscal year 2024 budget request. I 
am pleased to be here alongside Dr. Hayden.
    Working together, we continue to align our efforts by 
reflecting shared priorities. I would also like to thank and 
acknowledge my coworkers, colleagues, and dedicated employees 
who work diligently every day to support the functions of 
Congress, the Supreme Court, and the Library.
    I am proud to have served with the agency in various roles 
over the last 5 years. Since assuming this new role, I have 
used this first month to meet with subcommittees' clerks, Rules 
Committee staff, and House stakeholders. In order to learn more 
about key initiatives and identify areas of concern, I am now 
taking all this information into account to continue a plan and 
formulate a plan for the future, including recommendations.
    The AOC's $1.28 billion fiscal year 2024 budget request is 
focused on three key priorities, security, safety, and 
accountability. Security remains the agency's top budgetary 
requirement. With this recommendation and support of this 
subcommittee, the AOC has made significant process--progress to 
improve the security posture across campus.
    While some of these security changes are more visible than 
others, we will continue to balance and maintain the critical 
physical infrastructure while remaining prepared to respond 
rapidly to new developments.
    Safety is another significant priority. Across the agency 
we dedicate time and attention to safety training, processes, 
procedures, and operations. This budget request recognizes 
these essential measures with a focused effort to avoid 
hazards, risks, and interruptions.
    The third key budgetary priority is accountability, fiscal 
accountability, especially as it relates to the overall AOC 
culture and corresponding cultural change as stewards of the 
taxpayer dollars.
    Our current organizational framework is a siloed 
organization. The structure is antiquated, sluggish, and rigid. 
It has not kept up with the current industry practices and has 
not set consistent standards, policies, or procedures causing 
inequities in application, thus impacting agency morale.
    For example, the inconsistent application of policy across 
the agency is the norm. This inconsistency has resulted in the 
lack of accountability seen over the past few years, and if not 
solved now, will remain the standard business-as-usual 
practice.
    Serving as a Chief Architect, I am very familiar with the 
AOC's project management processes. We have traditionally 
managed our programs through a design, bid, then build 
environment, prompting the completion of one step before 
starting another.
    This process causes inefficiencies through duplication of 
efforts, lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities, leading 
to unbalanced workload assignments, thereby causing delays in 
project development, leading to redesign, scope creep, and 
modifications. This, coupled with the ongoing economic and 
labor challenges, has resulted in what we have seen as 
increased costs.
    To keep up with the current standards of practice, the AOC 
needs to realign operational functions in order to streamline 
management for a more collaborative matrixed organization. 
Ultimately, we have to change how we operate to improve our 
processes and procedures for the timeliness of responses to 
speak as one AOC with one voice.
    For the agency to succeed moving forward, we owe it to each 
other, our employees, taxpayer, and the future of the AOC to 
make these changes now. So, I thank you and ask for your 
support as we continue to transform and modernize the agency.
    Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Fischer, and Members of the 
subcommittee, thank you again for supporting the Architect of 
the Capitol's request for the fiscal year 2024 budget.
    [The statement follows:]
Prepared Statement of Chere Rexroat, Acting Architect & Chief Engineer, 
                        Architect of the Capitol
    Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Fischer, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the Fiscal Year 
(FY) 2024 budget for the Architect of the Capitol (AOC). We are 
committed to working closely with you, your staff, and the Senate 
Committee on Rules & Administration (Rules) to ensure that the AOC 
meets the needs and expectations of the Senate community.
    We are truly grateful for the agency's hard-working, mission-
focused employees who get the job done every day in order to support 
the functions of Congress, the Supreme Court and the Library of 
Congress (Library).
    Serving as the Acting Architect over this past month has been a 
privilege. I began my tenure by meeting with Committee staff to 
understand their concerns, issues, and priorities. I have also met with 
AOC staff to reestablish trust and confidence in leadership and ensure 
they know they are valued for their excellent work. I am personally 
committed to open and timely communication to be transparent and 
accountable, guaranteeing coordination with this Subcommittee, 
Congress, and internal entities, such as the AOC Inspector General.
    I joined the AOC in 2018 serving as the Deputy Chief Engineer and 
became the Chief Engineer in July 2022. The Office of the Chief 
Engineer's (OCE) mission is to provide consolidated services across the 
AOC for safe and efficient project delivery to include maintenance of 
critical infrastructure. OCE is predominantly known for planning, 
programming, design, acquisition, and execution of the agency's major 
construction projects, listed in the budget submission as the line- 
item construction program (LICP).
    The AOC's top priorities for the FY 2024 budget are security, 
safety and accountability.
                              i. overview
    The AOC supports the day-to-day operations of Congress, the Supreme 
Court and the Library. Every day, more than 2,400 AOC employees are 
responsible for preserving and maintaining more than 18.4 million 
square feet of facilities, 570 acres of grounds and thousands of works 
of art. Around the clock, our team is committed to ensuring these 
historic buildings and aging infrastructure are preserved for the 
benefit of future generations. At the same time, we are working 
tirelessly to upgrade our capabilities and facilities to meet current 
needs.
    The FY 2024 budget request of $1.128 billion represents a 14.5 
percent decrease from the FY 2023 enacted appropriation. The requested 
funding supports critical program investments in physical security, 
safety and facility management priorities. The FY 2024 request also 
includes funding for major special events that require significant 
planning, coordination and resources, such as the next Presidential 
inauguration.
              ii. prioritizing physical security & safety
    Physical security and safety are top priorities. With the support 
of this Committee, the AOC has made significant progress in improving 
the security posture across campus. The AOC continues to take steps to 
address projects prioritized in the comprehensive physical security 
assessment completed last year. As part of this process, the AOC is on 
track to implement consistent security standards across the Capitol 
campus. The FY 2024 budget request reflects the ongoing coordinated 
approach for projects, including repairing and replacing security 
kiosks, vehicle barriers and other protective measures throughout the 
Capitol campus. Moreover, in coordination with the United States 
Capitol Police (USCP), and the Senate and House Sergeant at Arms, the 
AOC stands ready to respond to emerging requirements.
    The overall safety of the AOC workforce, as well as everyone who 
works or visits here, is another significant priority. Across the 
agency, we continue to dedicate time and attention to training, 
procedures and supervision to ensure our workforce operates safely. 
This budget request addresses important areas of need, including fire 
alarm system upgrades, code deficiencies and system failure risks. One 
example of aging utility infrastructure is deteriorating concrete and 
piping components supporting the campus. These components demand 
immediate attention to avoid service interruptions or failures.
                  iii. supporting the senate community
    The AOC's FY 2024 budget request contains significant priorities 
for the Senate office buildings and Senate operations. The AOC plans to 
address necessary repairs and improvements for committee hearing rooms, 
elevators and air handling units.
    The AOC has commenced a long-term program to renovate 32 committee 
hearing rooms throughout the Senate office buildings. These renovations 
aim to improve technology and accessibility while prioritizing historic 
preservation. The requested funding supports the completion of two 
hearing rooms each year.
    This request proposes a multi-year program to refurbish and 
modernize 46 elevators and associated elevator machine rooms in all 
Senate buildings. The elevators require full refurbishment every 15 to 
20 years, and the AOC has proposed a schedule to refurbish the 
elevators to meet safety and code standards with minimized disruption 
to regular operations.
    In addition, the AOC will focus on several projects in the Hart 
Senate Office Building. One ongoing effort relates to the refurbishment 
of the air handling units. Originally installed in 1982, the units are 
nearing the end of their operational life, and the FY 2024 budget 
request will support the second phase of this construction project.
    AOC's funding request covers the second year of a multi-year 
program to renovate Senate food service operations. The Senate 
jurisdiction oversees nine food service facilities in the Senate office 
buildings and on the Senate side of the U.S. Capitol Building, which 
include vending and catering services on the Senate side of the Capitol 
campus. In addition, as requested by this Committee and Rules, the AOC 
has proposed a renovation program to transform current food service 
outlets into a dining experience reflecting the history and traditions 
of the United States Senate.
    The AOC will continue the Senate Recycling Program, reducing 
single-use plastics and advancing waste management in Senate facilities 
as part of ongoing maintenance and process improvement. In FY 2022, 
over 426 tons of non-construction waste was recycled through the AOC's 
program, including 231 tons of paper and cardboard; 60 tons of pre-
consumer compostable materials and cooking oil; 11 tons of mixed 
plastic, metal and glass containers; and 5.5 tons of used toner 
cartridges and electronic waste. Beyond existing measures, the AOC 
continues to further evaluate strategies to reduce single-use plastics 
and expand sustainable measures.
    Finally, as part of an ongoing collaboration with the Senate 
Sergeant at Arms, the FY 2024 request also includes a comprehensive 
building renovation at the Daniel Webster Page Residence to improve the 
building's functionality and accessibility.
             iv. modern management of aging infrastructure
    Aging facilities and infrastructure present a variety of issues and 
concerns. The past 3 years have only compounded many of these concerns, 
as supply chain shortages, raw material cost increases and the 
competition for skilled laborers have increased the difficulty of 
addressing existing deficiencies. Across the board, the AOC's funding 
request supports facility management and addresses an array of 
essential issues, including roof replacement and installation of 
emergency generators.
    Implementing an asset management system allows us to prioritize 
work through data-driven decisions. As we continue to develop our asset 
management system, we will promote proactive maintenance-based 
strategies. This program provides a disciplined, consistent approach to 
annual inspections based on the average lifecycle of key infrastructure 
elements. With this approach, the AOC will develop a long-term strategy 
to address existing backlogs and the associated costs of deferred 
maintenance requirements.
    The AOC also remains focused on comprehensive planning for the 
entire campus, taking into consideration immediate and long-term needs. 
With the Committee's support, this forward- looking plan and 
accompanying recommendations will set forth a robust approach for 
future generations.
    Over the past year, our staff has been delighted to welcome back 
the public to the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) and the U.S. Botanic 
Garden (Garden). Already during FY 2023, the CVC has hosted over 
360,000 visitors, and with this Committee's support, the redesigned 
Exhibition Hall has welcomed hundreds of enthusiastic students. This 
innovative space provides a series of new interactive experiences 
sharing the story of the U.S. Capitol and the legislative process. In 
addition, the new Democracy Lab provides a hands-on educational area 
with an array of activities for both the young and the young-at-heart, 
and staff offer on-site and online educational programs. Also, in FY 
2023, AOC websites, including the sites maintained by the CVC and the 
Garden, have recorded more than 1.3 million visitors and nearly 3.5 
million pageviews.
 v. recognizing employee accomplishments & meeting mission requirements
    The AOC remains focused on initiatives to improve employee morale. 
For example, the AOC is expanding training programs at all levels of 
the workforce. Every AOC employee can work with their supervisor on 
professional development plans and training opportunities. In addition, 
the agency's Chief Security Officer is leading implementation of 
emergency management and resiliency training.
    As the AOC strives to meet its strategic benchmarks on hiring and 
retention, we remain focused on ensuring that we have the appropriate 
training and resources our employees need to be successful. Most of our 
workforce is required to be on-site to perform their roles and 
responsibilities. At the same time, certain functions can be performed 
off-site and, as appropriate, we have implemented standardized 
government telework agreements that support our continuous and 
uninterrupted ability to serve and respond from anywhere, any time.
    To ensure that the AOC continues to attract and retain an 
exceptional workforce in the years ahead, we are also expanding 
outreach to educational institutions across the U.S. In just a few 
months, the AOC will welcome eight new apprentices who will be working 
throughout the agency with experienced mentors. Through this program 
and other training initiatives, the AOC is preparing to carry on the 
traditions of unique craftsmanship and ingenuity needed to work behind 
the scenes to support Congress, the Supreme Court and the Library.
                               conclusion
    On behalf of our dedicated public servants who carry out the 
mission every day, I appreciate the support provided by this Committee. 
Your support has been essential to our daily operations, sustained 
recruitment and retention efforts, and strengthened collaboration with 
Congress, the Supreme Court, the Library, USCP, and Senate and House 
Sergeant at Arms.
    Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Fischer, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for your time and support in consideration of 
the AOC's FY 2024 budget request.

                  LIBRARY OF CONGRESS' STRATEGIC PLAN

    Senator Reed. Thank you very much, Acting Architect. Dr. 
Hayden, as we have talked about it, the Library of Congress has 
recently completed its prior 5-year strategic plan and recently 
initiated a new plan that further expands on your efforts to 
modernize the Library. And can you give us an idea of how the 
goals of the previous plan were achieved, or met, or not met?
    Dr. Hayden. We are in the final year of our current 5-year 
strategic plan. The title of the plan and the guiding force is 
enhancing the Library experience, and that is in-person and in 
the digital realm as well.
    We have had four basic goals, expand access, enhance 
services, optimize our resources, and measure impact. 
Modernization has been at the heart of all of those efforts. We 
have had great success in modernizing many of our IT systems 
and working toward that as possible.
    We expanded our digital scan center, completed Fort Meade 
Module 6, continued work on the visitor experience in the 
Thomas Jefferson Building, and we have started this past summer 
on the next strategic plan, and it will be ready by October 1 
of 2023. It will carry us from fiscal year 2024 to 2028, and it 
builds on the current plan to maintain a user-centered focus.
    Our digital strategy is what will be different with the new 
plan as it will be incorporated into the larger strategic plan, 
and that was a major step, because now as our CIO says, 
technology and digital is baked into everything we do. And so 
having that now be part of all of our efforts will be quite 
remarkable for us.

                  LIBRARY'S FISCAL 2024 BUDGET REQUEST

    Senator Reed. Well, thank you very much. And in your fiscal 
year 2024 budget request, how does it--you can pick out some 
highlights of how it further is your strategic plan, both the 
one that is being completed and the one that will emerge.
    Dr. Hayden. Well, when you look at the fiscal year 2024 
request and the crucial part of expanding the access for all of 
our users and whatever unit we have, the copyright continuous 
development of the copyright system for all of its users and 
stakeholders will be key.
    We have made great progress so far, and we really are 
heartened by the fact that we will be able to continue that. 
Also, the National Library for the Blind and the Print 
Disabled, the continuous development there.
    They have had great success with introducing new braille e-
readers. The response has been phenomenal, as they have said, 
and really working on that. Expanding our access to, I would 
say, vulnerable users who really need to have the latest 
technology.
    So one of the requests was specific to that. And so, the 
request to also strengthen our service to Congress directly 
will also be something that we are looking at, optimizing and 
enhancing services.
    Senator Reed. Well, thank you very much, doctor. Acting 
Architect Rexroat, the Architect of the Capitol is a very 
dynamic agency. It faces many challenges, security, historic 
preservation, requests from Senators and representatives, 
etcetera.
    And as I mentioned in my opening statement, many people 
have indicated to me that the programmatic practice and 
leadership structure need to be reformed. And since taking over 
as the Acting Architect, what observations can you share with 
us about the operation and leadership of the organization?
    Ms. Rexroat. Thank you, sir, for the question. The 
observations that I have seen to date, again as I noted in my 
opening statement, are the unequitable application of policies. 
We find that the policies and procedures, because we were 
siloed, the jurisdictions were siloed, that they applied them 
differently.
    So now is trying to be one AOC. The main focus for the 
future is going to be make sure that we apply those equitably 
across the board. We also found that with that silo that we get 
piecemeal of information. What may happen in one jurisdiction 
may not be the same for the other jurisdictions.
    So, if we can get those synergies back together, that would 
help as well. And then, of course, differing priorities. We 
know, as you noted, that there are different priorities that 
come about, and it is a matter of getting those expectations 
aligned and making sure that we are addressing those as needed.
    So, sir, I hope that answers your question.
    Senator Reed. Indeed. Have you experienced any obstacles as 
you have stepped in? I mean, this has to be ultimately a 
cooperative, collegial effort in which, you know, mutual 
support and mutual effort are critical. Have you got that 
support?
    Ms. Rexroat. At this point in time, sir, it is still to be 
determined. I will say that I have had the pleasure of meeting 
with the Rules Committees, the subcommittees, and some of the 
major stakeholders.
    It has been my pleasure to be able to hear from them with 
their priorities are. Now I need to take those priorities back 
to my leadership so that we are in alignment moving forward. 
Some of the other obstacles, as you are aware of, or at least 
have been out there for the last few years is our hiring 
processes.
    That alignment also has to do with our management practices 
as well, making sure that we take care of those. And then, of 
course, succession planning. Make sure we have a left and right 
seat, right, so that if there is a gap in leadership, that we 
have the coverage that we need.
    Senator Reed. Right. And one of the problems that we have 
all addressed here is scoping these projects. We always end up 
realizing that they weren't scoped properly, they are more 
expensive, they are more complicated, etcetera. You have 
addressed that in your statement and I know you will address it 
in action, too. With that, let me recognize the Ranking Member.

             CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE BUDGET REQUEST

    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Hayden, I see 
that you are seeking about a 10 percent increase for the 
Congressional Research Service. There is a demand for their 
work, obviously, and that demand grows.
    The request includes additional funding for new information 
products for congress.gov and a new data analysis pilot 
program. You have mentioned that briefly in your opening 
comments and I would like to hear more about it.
    Can you explain how the request will improve congress.gov 
to provide the public with greater transparency into Congress's 
work? And how will the proposed data pilot program enhance the 
CRS's ability to provide Congress with greater quantitative 
research analysis?

                       CRS DATA ANALYSIS REQUEST

    Dr. Hayden. Thank you for that, because the request for the 
data analysis pilot is directly a result of a feasibility study 
that Congress requested, and to help CRS determine what its 
capacity is, what it needs to help with big data sets and that 
research.
    The feasibility study was completed and recommended the 
pilot, and the request that is in this year is for the pilot. 
It could be very exciting because it will take us into 
different types of things like data modeling and project 
software and cloud computing and all of these tools.
    But it is something that there is additional Congressional 
interest and need for being able to have CRS help with those 
types of requests. And then the bill summaries and the 
congress.gov enhancement. Right now, we are able to, for 
instance, every three weeks, add new features to congress.gov.
    And so being able to increase the timeliness of responses 
with congress.gov as well will help. The estimate is a 40 
percent enhancement in timelines, and that is really something 
when you think about it.
    Senator Fischer. When they made the estimate on that, on 
the feasibility study, did they take into account certain 
percentage for the growth increase that we are seeing? Congress 
is requesting a lot from CRS now, and is that going to be 
considered, that increase in the time required to get reports 
back?
    Dr. Hayden. Yes.
    Senator Fischer. It is all exciting.
    Dr. Hayden. It is something because we want to be able to 
give Congress the most timely, most efficient service. You have 
your own special forces and we are your research arm.
    Senator Fischer. And we appreciate that.
    Dr. Hayden. You being able to have the latest tools, the 
latest types of things, really, I think would enhance. And so 
these efforts are dedicated to making sure that Congress has 
the most up to date and sometimes cutting edge.
    Senator Fischer. Great. Thank you. Ms. Rexroat, I am aware 
that there is a significant number of deferred maintenance 
needs across the Capitol campus, but I see in the fiscal year 
2024 budget request, it is going to fund an additional 50 full 
time staff, as well as prioritize other operating budget 
increases.
    Given the scale of the backlog that we see here, can you 
explain why you prioritize the operational costs, and how the 
agency--how you figure out how to balance those operational 
costs and major construction costs when you are budget 
forecasting? How do you do that?
    Ms. Rexroat. Thank you, Senator. That is a very good 
question. I am looking into that right now and trying to digest 
the most of it as sitting in the seat. So, I will be happy to 
get back with you on that.
    I know that it is weighed against what we can--what the 
projects are, and then, of course, what we can support with 
resources against those projects themselves. So, the staffing 
to make sure that we are able to execute.
    Senator Fischer. Okay. When you get back to us, could you 
let me know how the AOC tracks its deferred maintenance backlog 
as well?
    Ms. Rexroat. Yes, of course.

                 LIBRARY'S REQUEST AND STRATEGIC VISION

    Senator Fischer. Thank you very much. Appreciate that. Dr. 
Hayden, a key aspect in the Library's strategic plan is 
expanding Americans' access to all of the Library's resources. 
How does the Library's fiscal year 2024 request align with that 
strategic vision, and what are the primary initiatives the 
request would fund so that we can enhance every American's 
access to the Library?
    Dr. Hayden. I will start with the National Library for the 
Blind and Print Disabled, and the new devices and the efforts 
to establish continuous development for that user group. And it 
was part of the previous strategic plan and now is a vital part 
of what we know will be an increased need with the expansion of 
the eligibility of people who can use NLS services.
    People who have dyslexia, for instance, and a generational 
shift, whether they are going to be coming to us with their own 
devices and being able to respond to that. And so, the request 
this year will facilitate and establish that.
    And also, with the copyright system and continuing the 
development to get to the most important part of copyright 
system, the registration system. We have a very active public 
advisory committee that is very anxious that we continue that.
    And also, CRS and support for Congress. So, there are 
different users. Congress first and the people Congress serves.
    Senator Fischer. When you say that the--when Americans come 
in with their own devices, are you talking about computers or--
--
    Dr. Hayden. Different devices so they can download from the 
cloud----
    Senator Fischer. So, you will make it compatible with any 
device that comes in, or----?
    Dr. Hayden. That is the challenge----
    Senator Fischer [continuing]. At least to try to adapt to 
it?

              CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY

    Dr. Hayden. And the adapting. You really hit on the 
continuous development part, and so you will see that term used 
with all of our technology efforts that we are shifting.
    We want to establish systems that can change as technology 
changes and I know personally, the tech changes quickly and we 
will have to be--another part of that, though, you will see in 
our efforts that we are very concerned as we increase access 
through technology, that our cybersecurity is and continues to 
be a major focus and strengthened.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Senator Reed. Thank you, Senator Fischer. Ms. Rexroat, let 
me resume where I stopped, which is basically this issue of 
scoping, of course, estimation seems to be inadequate because 
of cost overruns. So, what do you believe are the issues within 
the AOC that preclude the agency from doing accurate project 
scoping cost estimations and timelines?
    Ms. Rexroat. Initial, sir, response has to do with the 
planning. We have to start with our planning processes and make 
sure that we get the scopes identified clear and upfront. If we 
can't do that, then we are just tracing the scope as the 
project continues to move.
    So, I will be happy to get back to you with some more 
information on that, but I know we have to look at our initial 
planning processes in order to get it cleared down the line.
    Senator Reed. Now, as Chief Engineer, prior to becoming the 
Acting Architect, will you take any steps to try to improve 
this process?
    Ms. Rexroat. Yes, sir.
    Senator Reed. Could you allude to those?
    Ms. Rexroat. Sure. I had taken the same approach with being 
the Chief Engineer here and started with some initial 
observations. With those observations, I did find that, again, 
we were siloed and we had a little bit more of a stop, start, 
stop, start process.
    With that in mind, we were taking a look at how we could 
get more of a matrixed organization. Once a team is initially 
identified that team then stays on the project from the very 
beginning all the way through the end, cradle to grave, as you 
have heard. That way we get the continuity of ownership.
    We get the continuity of what happened on the project and 
how the project was initially planned, scoped, and outlined. 
Along with that change, I also was taking a look at a project 
controls branch, which would then come in and be my quality 
control, quality assurance arm of the OCE. Therefore, we had 
checks and balances along with that team structure.
    Senator Reed. Now, are there any issues regarding 
contracting? Because I would presume that you would have to 
engage contractors, subcontractors, etcetera.
    Ms. Rexroat. Contracting does currently fall under OCE, so 
we have had them in the mix through the entire process and will 
continue to have them as we develop the new changes moving 
forward.
    Senator Reed. And what resources or other support do you 
believe you need in order to correct these factors long term? 
And is it reflected in this budget?
    Ms. Rexroat. It is, sir, to some degree. We have been 
asking for staff over the past few budget cycles with regards 
to management, project management, and construction management. 
It has been a challenge.
    We did stay, completely opened and our projects did stay 
operational throughout the entire pandemic. There is a lot of 
competition within the metro area for qualified managers and 
construction managers, so we have that resource to contend 
with.
    But knowing that we can continue to get our projects 
outlined and identify upfront early, we will be able to take a 
look at what the staffing requirements are for projects versus 
trying to do them after the fact.

                    LIBRARY RECRUITMENT AND STAFFING

    Senator Reed. Thank you very much. And Dr. Hayden, one of 
the issues that seems to be everywhere is the difficulty of 
securing talented, qualified personnel to fill the ranks. You 
are asking for additional FTEs, and the question is, can you 
fill them, etcetera.
    Every business I go to, and I think Senator Fischer has the 
same experience, we can't find the workers--we can't find good 
workers.
    This morning we had the Army, the Navy, and Air Force about 
recruiting and surprise, they are having a very challenging 
time finding recruits. So, can you comment upon your ability to 
recruit and retain the highest quality?
    Dr. Hayden. In our fiscal year 2024 budget request, we are 
asking for support to help with contract specialists. That is 
one of the areas that has been identified throughout the 
government.
    We are working on trying to help keep our staff - in a 
number of ways. We opened our vacancy announcements and are 
continuing. When we revised our telework policy, we found that 
it is also something that helps in terms of recruitment, and 
diversity, and being able to do that.
    And also looking at more outreach to organizations and 
events that might help us with recruitment. But that is a 
definite problem that we share. There are other positions 
besides the contracting that are difficult.
    Attorneys with foreign legal specialties, our law Library 
is the largest in the world, and specifically supports Congress 
as well, and finding people who have those types of skills, 
especially in foreign language, is very difficult.
    So, we have to find ways that we can make our positions 
attractive, but also do the technical things to get them here.
    Senator Reed. Well, please keep us apprized, both of you, 
of this issue of qualified workers, finding them, keeping them 
because it is critical to the success of both your agencies. 
Senator Fischer, please.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Ms. Rexroat, 
recently we have seen the misuse of government resources at the 
highest level of the agency, and it has been a point of public 
discussion. It is important that the American people understand 
that the AOC is a financial steward of those resources that 
they receive.
    What does your organization need for better internal 
controls, and does this budget reflect that priority? Have you 
had those discussions? Are you ready to, you know, figure out 
how to get a handle on things, what needs to happen, and more 
importantly, how can we help?
    Ms. Rexroat. Thank you very much for that. Yes, ma'am, I am 
taking a look into that. As I noted earlier, we have found that 
with the silos, there has been definitely disparate application 
of how policies and which, of course, have led to some of the 
challenges we have seen over the past few years.
    I am looking into that, and my goal is to make sure that we 
get those into alignment, to have greater accountability, 
equitability across the whole agency, and ensure that the staff 
and the supervisors know what is the correct path forward.
    So, with that in mind, yes, absolutely. I am taking a look 
at that and look forward to your support with that. We will 
need it.
    Senator Fischer. Are you looking just within the agency? 
Are you asking for any outside consultation to come in and be 
able to offer suggestions as well to, you know, go through an 
analysis of the agency, or do you want to keep it in the 
agency? Where are you at this point?
    Ms. Rexroat. Sorry to interrupt, but yes, I have broached 
that option. I do want to put all the options on the table in 
order to see what can best serve the agency moving forward, and 
that option is out there.
    I am working through right now the scope and, of course, 
the financial requirements in order to get that done. But it is 
an option that is under consideration and on the table.
    Senator Fischer. Well, thank you very much for stepping 
forward to address it. I know you understand it.
    Ms. Rexroat. Thank you, ma'am.

                        VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT

    Senator Fischer. Dr. Hayden, as I mentioned in my opening 
comments about the Veterans History Project, I personally had a 
wonderful experience with that, and I know that we all share 
the goal of ensuring that the program has the resources that it 
needs so it can continue to be a success.
    Could you walk us through the projects and digitization 
efforts of the material that has already been collected? I 
mean, I would imagine you have a lot of material there. You 
know, how do you plan to do that, and can it be done in a 
fairly timely manner, or is this something that is going to 
take a long period of time? And then how do you hope to reach 
more veterans to tell their story?
    Dr. Hayden. The veteran's history website was recently 
updated and it is the first time in about 20 years. And so 
that--in terms of being able to attract more people, we had 3 
million visitors to the website just last year, and we have 
114,000 collections that are available.
    That includes also our ability to work with Gold Star 
families, and that has really expanded our reach as well. We 
were able to work with over 50 congressional offices. Members 
were able to do videos and put them on their websites, and 
really, as you know, do workshops virtually.
    And we are working with our IT systems to make sure that 
people in the future will be able to use the latest digital 
tools to send materials to us, the recordings. And we see that 
that aspect, beyond the workshops that we give and we have all 
types of programing, and we have been doing quite a bit of that 
and did a lot during the pandemic, in fact.
    But being able to make it easier for people to send in 
materials. And our Folklife Center has a program called 
Paprika, like the spice, we have invested quite a bit in terms 
of making that technology easier so that we can ingest 
different types of digital input. We would love to give you a 
kind of a briefing on that. We have our Chief Information 
Officer, Judith Conklin.
    And I just want to take this opportunity to express our 
appreciation for her. She is a certified cyber security expert. 
She is a veteran herself. She left as a Major and she is here 
behind me. We are so proud because she has just won, for the 
second time, an award for Federal workers for her efforts in 
cyber security.
    So, all of the things, when we talk digital, when we talk 
technology, we are led by Judith Conklin.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you. Congratulations, ma'am, on your 
award.
    Ms. Conklin. Thank you.
    Senator Fischer. And thank you for the work that you do. 
Ms. Rexroat, we are seeing more visitors come. You know, March, 
we have seen a huge uptick in the number of visitors to the 
Capitol.
    We have a lot of folks coming out to meet with us, but also 
to learn more about Washington D.C., the history that is here, 
and all that it offers. And so, I want to acknowledge the CDCs 
staff, along with the Capitol Police officers.
    They have helped to open the Capitol campus. But how is the 
AOC managing the influx? Is there anything from an 
appropriations perspective that we can provide to make that 
experience for our friends and neighbors even better?
    Ms. Rexroat. Thank you, ma'am. From my understanding right 
now, the answer is I think we have got what we need. But I will 
definitely check back and make sure that that is the truth.
    Senator Fischer. Yes.
    Ms. Rexroat. I will find out for you.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

                       CHAIRMEN'S CLOSING REMARKS

    Senator Reed. Well, thank you both, not only for your 
testimony, but for your service. And I just have one final 
question. Major Conklin, is that Major in the United States 
Army?
    Ms. Conklin. Yes.
    Senator Reed. Well, bravo. I really--I mean, I applaud you, 
and I am not surprised either. Thank you for your work. And 
thank you for the work from all your colleagues at the Library 
of Congress and also the architect of the counsel's office.
    This concludes the Legislative Branch Appropriations 
subcommittee hearing regarding fiscal year 2024 funding for the 
Library of Congress and the Architecture of the Capitol. Again, 
I thank you, Dr. Hayden and Ms. Rexroat, for your testimony.

        UNITED STATES SENATE SERGEANT AT ARMS AND DOORKEEPER AND

                      UNITED STATES CAPITOL POLICE

                 OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR JACK REED

    Senator Reed. Good afternoon. Senator Fischer is on her 
way. But at this point I will call this subcommittee to order.
    I would like to welcome everyone, to the last of fiscal 
year 2024 Budget Hearings for the Legislative Branch 
Appropriations Subcommittee.
    Today, we have with us the Senate's Sergeant at Arms, Ms. 
Karen Gibson, General, United States Army, retired. And Chief 
of the United States Capitol Police, Chief J. Thomas Manger. 
Thank you, both.
    I would like to thank you for joining us to testify. And I 
would ask for unanimous consent that the witnesses' written 
testimony be placed in the hearing record.
    And hearing no objection, so ordered.
    As I noted in our earlier hearings, the Legislative Branch 
agencies have submitted fiscal year 2024 budget requests that 
account for a $215 million increase over the enacted fiscal 
year 2023 Legislative Branch appropriation. We will be 
carefully considering these requests to ensure they continue to 
improve our ability to meet our responsibility to govern 
effectively.
    For fiscal year 2024, the Sergeant at Arms is requesting 
$319.8 million in appropriated funds, which is an increase of 
$32.7 million over the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. This 
increase provides funding for COLA-related costs in locality 
for 43 new positions to support various Sergeant at Arms 
organizational elements, and for salary adjustments for onboard 
personnel.
    This increase also provides for the mandatory Postal Square 
move of certain SAA operations, inauguration support cost, IT 
infrastructure, and cybersecurity requirements, various 
technology upgrades within the Senate, and the Senate 
Residential Security System Program.
    Today, we will also be reviewing the United States Capitol 
Police's fiscal year 2024 budget request.
    And before I address the USCP request, I would like to 
thank you, Chief Manger, and your team for all you do to 
support the safety and security of the Capitol Complex each and 
every day.
    Included in the President's budget request, is a request 
for appropriation of $840.9 million for the Capitol Police, 
which is an increase of $106.3 million from the fiscal year 
2023 enacted level. This is an increase in both the salaries 
and the general expense appropriations. This increase provides 
for the annualization of salaries for onboard personnel in 
fiscal year 2023, increased over time for core mission, and 
national political conventions, funding for new positions, and 
COLA and miscellaneous payments--funding.
    This increase also provides for increased protective 
services support during an election year, to include at 
national political conventions, funding to support the purchase 
and lease of various fleet vehicles, funding to support the 
continuation of the contract to the Security Guard Program, 
technical and physical security equipment, and lifecycle 
replacements and upgrades, and various other non-personnel 
related costs.
    I look forward to hearing from both of our witnesses today.
    We will be joined shortly by Senator Murray, the Chair of 
the Senate Appropriations Committee. We have been joined by 
Ranking Member, Senator Fischer. Thank you.
    And at this point I would like to recognize Senator Fischer 
for her opening remarks.

                OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR DEB FISCHER

    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you General Gibson, and Chief Manger, for being 
with us today, for our Third Legislative Branch Hearing.
    I want to begin by thanking the men and women of your 
agencies for the work they do to keep Members of Congress, 
staff, and visitors on the Capitol Campus safe every day. I am 
deeply grateful for their service, and acknowledge that their 
support is what enables us to do our job in a secure and open 
environment.
    Both the Sergeant at Arms and the Capitol Police are 
responsible for maintaining the security of the Capitol Campus, 
and both agencies have a no-fail mission. In recent years, the 
SAA and the Department have faced increasing threats against 
the Congress and evolving mission requirements.
    General Gibson, as the Senate Sergeant at Arms, you have a 
vast range of responsibilities, which span from ensuring the 
physical, personal, and electronic safety of Senators and 
staff, to providing support operations to keep the Senate 
functioning efficiently and effectively.
    For fiscal year 2024 the SAA seeks an 11.4 percent increase 
over last year's enacted level. The request includes funding 
for physical security efforts, information technology, and 
cybersecurity initiatives, and 31 additional FTEs to support 
the Office of Security Emergency Preparedness and Continuity, 
and the Chief Information Officer. In your testimony I hope to 
hear how the requested increase will enable the SAA to improve 
and expand the physical security and cyber defenses of the 
Senate.
    Chief Manger, it is nice to see you again. Thank you for 
hosting me earlier this year at headquarters. I enjoyed our 
conversation and the tour of the Command Center.
    The Department is requesting $841 million, an increase of 
14.4 percent over the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. Congress 
has invested considerable funds in the Department over the past 
couple of years. We have provided funding to hire additional 
officers, upgrade equipment, expand training, improve 
operations, and offer benefits to new and current personnel.
    I look forward to hearing the impact these investments have 
had, and examining how we can best position the Capitol Police 
for the future. We are committed to the safety and security of 
Members, their families, staff, visitors, and Capitol 
facilities. We must carefully consider the significant needs of 
all our security-related agencies, and ensure coordination and 
cooperation in their efforts.
    To that end, Chairman Reed and I will continue to work 
together, in a bipartisan manner, to meet the mission 
requirements for the SAA and the Capitol Police.
    Thank you, again, to our witnesses for being here. And I 
look forward to your testimony.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Reed. Thank you, Senator Fischer.
    And I now ask our witnesses, beginning with the Sergeant at 
Arms, General Gibson, to give a brief opening statement. As you 
know, the written testimony of each witness will be printed in 
full in the hearing record.
    General.
                                ------                                


          UNITED STATES SENATE SERGEANT AT ARMS AND DOORKEEPER

STATEMENT OF HON. KAREN H. GIBSON, SERGEANT AT ARMS AND 
            DOORKEEPER OF THE SENATE
    General Gibson. Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Fischer, 
Members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to 
testify in support of the Sergeant at Arms fiscal year 2024 
Budget Request.
    I want to thank the subcommittee for supporting our 
initiatives over the last 2 years, which have allowed us to 
improve security and continue critical modernization. We remain 
dedicated to meeting the personal, physical, and cybersecurity 
needs of the Senate, as well as providing essential 
administrative and logistical support. We do so, seeking at all 
times, to improve our effectiveness through innovation and a 
dedication to customer satisfaction.
    In that spirit, we created a security portal through which 
offices and committees can directly request security services 
which are tracked and responded to in real time.
    Two years ago, security support requests were made via 
paper letters, physically routed through distribution, the same 
portal shows my team the status of Emergency Preparedness plans 
and training, the recency of residential security assessments, 
and the nature of threats against senators.
    We are also fielding an accountability tool for use on a 
mobile device that allows staff to directly report their 
personal status and location in an emergency, providing real-
time visibility to office emergency coordinators. Another 
emergency preparedness app readily provides staff with office-
specific procedures and contacts during an emergency.
    Finally, rather than relying on staffs' availability to 
attend in-person training, we have developed numerous videos 
that can be viewed at the time and place of one's choosing on a 
broad variety of topics. Our security mission expands beyond 
the Capitol grounds. To demonstrate and promote security at 
State offices, with the assistance of the Rules Committee, we 
constructed a life-sized model of a State office in the 
basement of the Russell Senate Office Building, complete with 
recommended security equipment and design features, which has 
led to the adoption of important features, such as video, 
intercoms, IT security closets, duress buttons, and secure 
reception areas.
    Because this room is outfitted with remote learning 
technology, we will expand its use to include virtual classes 
on state security topics.
    Working hand-in-glove with the Capitol Police, we have a 
renewed focus on personal and residential security, as you will 
see in our request, for the Residential Security System 
Program.
    To date, 37 Senators have received requested Residential 
Security Assessments led by Capitol Police physical security 
experts, and we are on track to start installing security 
equipment identified by the assessments this summer.
    That said, the most persistent threats we face are in the 
cyber domain. We have carefully applied funds to improve the 
resilience, security, and modernization of Senate 
communications. The Senate network is now backed up in two 
modern dispersed data centers, and we protect the network with 
a myriad of software, hardware, and trained professionals. This 
comes at a cost, as you see in our budget request that asks for 
an additional $2.945 million to assist in proactive defense.
    We have also prioritized modernization, including updating 
TranSAAct, partnering with the Secretary of the Senate to 
enhance office payroll processes, and fielding the Unified 
Communication and Collaboration System. Our commitment to 
innovation and customer satisfaction extends to every service 
we provide.
    Last year, we opened the Senate's first Passport Office, 
completing over 1,200 passports in 9 months. We enacted a 
portal system, Direct Express, which allows offices to order 
services through an innovative web-to-print storefront, it cuts 
processing by 90 percent, saving time, money, and supplies. 
Custom flag certificates can take less than a minute using this 
storefront, rather than the 3 to 4 previous hours.
    I am especially proud of our innovative work to support the 
new need for closed captioning on the Senate floor and in 
hearings. In just weeks we developed a bespoke solution for the 
floor and built a temporary system to support closed captioning 
in select committees. Contracts in place will allow us to scale 
as needed, and for the first time provide closed captioning for 
all hearings in D.C. by the end of the year. This is a great 
illustration of the innovation I see daily across the Sergeant 
at Arms.
    This budget request is focused on three core 
responsibilities: The security and safety of senators, staff, 
constituents, and visitors; the security and reliability of 
Senate communications, and innovative solutions to support the 
Senate's needs.
    We seek $5 million in no-year funding to upgrade audio-
visual equipment in committee hearing rooms, $2 million to fund 
the Senate's share of the campus-wide Joint Audible Warning 
System; and $2.5 million for the Residential Security System 
Program. We also request $4 million for costs associated with 
moving out of Postal Square.
    We request 43 additional positions, 20 will support 
physical security programs, such as the Senate Residential 
Security System Program. Eleven will support critical functions 
for the Chief Information Officer. The remaining 12 address 
additional needs of other personal support efforts, such as 
rolling out the Green and Gold Congressional Aide Program for 
veterans at the Senate.
    In closing, I want to highlight the work also of the 
Capitol Police Board, which I chair this year. I am grateful 
for the strong working relationship with the Capitol Police, 
the Architect of the Capitol, and my counterparts in the House.
    We have reopened the Capitol complex, while ensuring the 
police are properly staffed to meet mission requirements. We 
hired a new Inspector General and established a working group 
to ensure the Board makes the best use of IG reports as an 
oversight tool.
    With the assistance of Congress and this Committee, we 
completed a comprehensive security review of the campus, 
prioritized repairs, and worked to support the men and women of 
the police.
    I am especially pleased that the General Accountability 
Office recently found the Capitol Police Board has fully 
incorporated leading governance practices to enhance 
accountability, transparency, and external communication.
    As Chair, I will continue to ensure the protection of the 
Congressional community remains at the forefront of all we do.
    Finally, thank you for your support of the Sergeant at 
Arms, and for the opportunity to discuss our accomplishments in 
our fiscal year 2024 budget request.
    I stand ready for your questions.
    [The statement follows:]
 Prepared Statement of Honorable Karen H. Gibson, Sergeant at Arms and 
                        Doorkeeper of the Senate
    For Fiscal Year 2024, the Office of the Senate Sergeant at Arms 
(SAA) respectfully requests $319,776,000 and 1,037 Full-Time 
Equivalents (FTEs) for Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24). This is an 11.4% 
increase over the Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) enacted budget and an 
increase of 43 FTEs. This request includes no-year funding totaling 
$9,500,000 for the Senate hearing room renovations, Senate Residential 
Security System Program, and for the shared use of the Senate's Joint 
Audible Warning System.
    Before I detail our specific requests for FY24, I want to highlight 
some of the many initiatives the SAA has undertaken in the 2 years I 
have been the Sergeant at Arms.
    Communication with Senate offices is a top priority. In partnership 
with the Secretary of the Senate, we created the Senate Operations 
Center (SOC). This one-stop shop disseminates information to Senate 
offices during emergencies or security incidents. The SOC is 
operational weekdays from 7:00 am--10:00 pm, or until the Senate 
adjourns, and is tied into the USCP Command Center for timely 
information on events on or near the Capitol and Senate Office 
Buildings. By consolidating Senate emergency and security information 
into the SOC, we have streamlined and centralized emergency messaging 
to the Senate Community, and are able to provide accurate and timely 
information to facilitate decisions.
    Each Monday morning, the SAA sends out a weekly bulletin to all 
Senate Offices, Committees, and support entities. The bulletin 
consolidates what were multiple daily emails into one reference 
document that details door hours, permitted demonstrations for the 
upcoming week, upcoming trainings, and announcements on new services, 
software, and events.The communications team also created The Chamber, 
a quarterly publication by the SAA highlighting issues and services in 
a format that allows greater depth. Our upcoming Chamber will highlight 
ADA accessibility information for Senate staff and visitors. The 
bulletin and The Chamber have been very well received by the Senate 
Community. In order to receive feedback from the offices, we launched a 
Feedback portal on Webster that allows direct feedback to the SAA, the 
Deputy SAA and the Chief of Staff on any issues related to the SAA or 
the USCP. This feedback can be anonymous or individuals may leave 
contact information for a direct response.
    We hired a new Director of the Joint Office of Training and 
Development and that team has been prioritizing emergency and security 
training. They have created a series of short videos on responses to 
various types of emergencies and created a self-paced webinar on 
Responding to an Active Shooter. This training is online, accessible 
24/7 and makes the information easier for staff to access any emergency 
training as often as they need. We also introduced a new class: Event 
Planning: Best Practices in Safety and Security. This class is designed 
to educate Senate staff who plan events in D.C. or in State offices on 
ways to include security in the event planning process. Our State 
office team developed specialized training to enhance security options 
in State offices and offers CPR, First Aid, and Stop the Bleed classes 
for State Offices.
    In March 2023, we rolled out the Account Tool application which 
sends messages to each D.C.-based Senate staff during an incident or 
emergency so that they can report their own location and status. Each 
Office Emergency Coordinator can see a dashboard of all their employees 
who have reported their status during the incident. This is an 
advancement in how we handle accountability: no longer is one person 
responsible for reporting in for their entire office. Now, every staff 
member reports their own status during an emergency. This application 
allows for rapid accounting of personnel, allows offices to easily 
reach out to staff who have not reported their status, and allows staff 
to ask for help or report injuries.
    By May of 2023, we will have fully implemented our new Emergency 
Preparation (EP) application which will allow staff in each office to 
find and follow their office's specific plan for emergencies. It will 
show evacuation routes, internal relocation areas, and the designated 
shelter-in-place location for each individual office. This is an 
advancement in how offices provide information to their staff by 
literally putting this information in their hand on their mobile 
device.
    SAA teams coordinate security requests for Senators when they 
travel or hold events in the home state. We also coordinate security at 
hearings and arrange residential security assessments for Senators. Two 
years ago, these requests were all via individual letters to me. We now 
have a security portal where all requests are entered by an office and 
action is taken and tracked without the time-consuming exchange of 
letters.
    As we continue to enhance Capitol campus and Senator residential 
security we are also working to enhance security for our state offices. 
We have set up a state office demonstration room in the Russell 
Building where Senators and staff can come and see all the security 
measures available in state offices. We used the demonstration room 
during the transition to the 118th Congress and were able to show 
incoming Senators all the security features available in their State 
Offices. I encourage all Senators to bring their Chief of Staff and 
their Administrative Director to our demo room and learn what security 
enhancements you already have in place in each of your state offices, 
and what additional options are available.
    With the support of the Secretary of the Senate, and approval from 
the Senate Rules Committee, the Senate Post Office began accepting 
passport applications on June 13, 2022. The Senate Post Office was 
approved, by the State Department, to be an official Passport Issuance 
Office through their Special Issuance Passport Program (SIPP). The 
Senate Passport Office offers official travel and tourism passport 
services for Senate members, staff, and their immediate families. In 
the 10 months since the Passport Office has been open, we have 
completed over 1283 passports for the Senate community. On April 4, 
2022, the Senate Post Office began offering notary services to the 
Senate community, augmenting services provided by the Disbursing Office 
and SAA Human Resources. To date, notary public services were provided 
to 262 Senate staff.
    The CIO team does a tremendous job ensuring our enterprise network 
has near zero downtime, and is backed up in two geographically 
dispersed data centers. This not only makes the Senate network safer 
but it also provides resiliency and emergency backup should one of our 
data centers experience an outage. This type of architecture and 
resiliency is not inexpensive as our appropriations request 
demonstrates, but it is required to ensure that the Senate can function 
at all times. The CIO team manages our communications and has recently 
undertaken the Unified Communications and Collaboration (UCC) project 
which will replace every desk phone in the Senate--both in Washington 
DC, and in every state office. Our commitment to the Senate is that 
communications are resilient and that offices have the equipment and 
the software they need to do their jobs.
    The Cybersecurity team protects our network with perimeter pen-
testing and multiple monitoring tools, and a highly trained 24/7 cyber 
team. We have increased our training to the Senate community enhancing 
the cybersecurity training required of all Senate staff with customized 
training for offices to help secure Senate data both on-premises and in 
the cloud. We have extended our cybersecurity protections to our cloud-
based services to ensure they exceed current Federal standards. We have 
enhanced the security of our mobile devices to protect data on the 
devices and prevent malware from being transferred to our network. In 
terms of innovation, our software developers are about to begin work 
with the Senate Disbursing Office to make payroll and overtime payments 
secure, auditable, and easier to create and submit for Senate Offices 
and Committees. We are also modernizing TranSAAct, one of the core 
systems Senate offices use for SAA services such as parking, 
identification cards, smart cards, floor privileges, and asset 
management.
    When I testified before this committee in April of 2021, after 30 
days in this role, I discussed my top priority: working with my Capitol 
Police Board (CPB) partners to develop a comprehensive plan to keep the 
Capitol and its occupants safe, guided by the desire to maintain a 
secure, open campus that balances access and security.
    There is much more work ahead, but we have made significant 
progress as a Board. With the assistance of Congress and this 
Committee, we completed a comprehensive security review of the campus, 
prioritized repairs and improvements to our security infrastructure, 
and worked to provide needed relief and support to the men and women of 
the United States Capitol Police (USCP) that protect our entire 
community. I will continue to ensure the protection of the 
Congressional community remains at the forefront of all we do.
USCP Reorganization
    The Capitol Police Board has worked with Chief Manger to support 
his vision for the future of the USCP. His reorganization plan focuses 
on expanding the Department's intelligence, threat assessment, 
operational planning, and dignitary protection capabilities while it 
continues to increase its staffing level. We support the Chief's work 
to transform the USCP to ensure USCP's current and future missions 
address feedback from USCP officers and our Congressional stakeholders.
USCP Hiring and Staffing
    The Board has worked closely with the Department and Congress to 
improve USCP's ability to attract, hire, and retain professional law 
enforcement officers to protect the Capitol complex and its occupants. 
At its lowest point after January 6, USCP had just over 1800 officers. 
Today, that number stands at more than 1900, with almost 200 recruit 
officers graduating this October. The Board has assisted the department 
in setting pay and retention policies aimed to attract both new and 
experienced law enforcement officers, established a lateral transfer 
program for experienced officers, and created a retired annuitant 
program for lighter work posts. The Board also authorized the use of 
Capitol Security Officers to augment USCP at select posts.
    While these efforts have been successful, we still have more work 
to do. We are close to our pre-January 6 staffing numbers, however, the 
mission demand in certain areas of the Department has increased 
considerably. The Board will continue to work closely with the Chief 
and our stakeholders to ensure the Department is able to meet its 
expanding mission at the same time as it is able to provide its 
officers with the support and work-life balance they deserve.
Reopening
    The Capitol Police Board has spent much of the past 2 years working 
with the Department and our stakeholders to fully reopen the Capitol 
Complex while ensuring USCP is properly staffed to meet the mission. 
I'm pleased to report to you today that we are very close to a complete 
reopening of the Campus. On the Senate side, we have re-opened all pre-
COVID doors, and only the vehicle barricade at 1st and Constitution 
Avenue remains closed. For the American People, we have re-opened the 
CVC on Saturdays. USCP should be staffed to support the traditional 
summer visitor load following Memorial Day. We will reopen the vehicle 
barricade when staffing allows.
Temporary Fencing
    One area of focus for the Board this year will be the development 
of consistent guidelines and decision points for the deployment of 
temporary fencing surrounding the Capitol. These guidelines will 
include a balance of threat, event, and Continuity of Congress 
considerations that can be applied to routine events such as National 
Special Security Events as well as unplanned events. I believe these 
guidelines will assist the Board in evaluating the balance between 
security and access, as well as communicating decisions with our 
stakeholders.
GAO Report/Communication With Stakeholders
    The Capitol Police Board has taken seriously our responsibility to 
be transparent, accountable, and responsive to our stakeholders. In 
response to a 2017 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, as 
Board Chair in 2021, I led the Board as it finalized updates and 
implemented those changes to its governance practices. We held 
stakeholder meetings and updated and issued a revised Manual of 
Procedures. The GAO noted: ``We reviewed the Manual to assess its 
inclusion of leading practices, and, in the spring and summer of 2022, 
we conferred with Congressional stakeholders to understand their 
knowledge of the Manual's updates and the scope and nature of their 
interactions with the Board. Based on our reviews of the Manual and the 
information we collected from Congressional stakeholders about their 
engagement with the Board, the Board has complied with the 
recommendation, and we will close it as implemented.'' Our work does 
not end with the closure of that recommendation, and I look forward to 
continued engagement with our stakeholders.
Inspector General Reports and Hiring
    I take very seriously my role on the Board overseeing the Capitol 
Police. A critical part of that oversight is ensuring that the Capitol 
Police is properly responding to its Inspector General and implementing 
recommendations from the IG and other outside reports. The Department 
has approximately 61 open recommendations from the USCP IG, of which 28 
are related to the January 6 flash reports. In 2021, the Board 
established a working group to assist in reviewing the flash reports 
that assist the Board in prioritizing and reviewing the Department's 
efforts to implement the IG's recommendations. This year, the Board 
leveraged the working group to provide the Department with guidance and 
direction on moving outstanding IG recommendations to closure.
    After consultation with the IGs from the Library of Congress, 
Government Publishing Office, and GAO, we conducted a national search 
and selected Mr. Ron Russo as the USCP's new Inspector General. Mr. 
Russo is an experienced law enforcement professional who has served in 
audit, investigatory, and law enforcement roles. The Board looks 
forward to supporting Mr. Russo as he continues the critical mission of 
the USCP IG.
    The achievements of the SAA in the last 2 years have been in 
security, training, communications and IT systems. Our focus has been 
modernization, innovation, communication and customer service. I am 
proud of all we have accomplished. Thank you to all the dedicated SAA 
staff who make all of this good work possible, and to this Committee 
for your trust, guidance and support.
Requests for FY24
    The projects we will be undertaking in FY24 are focused on my core 
responsibilities: security and safety of Senators and staff, security 
and reliability of the enterprise network, and ensuring we meet the 
needs of our customers.
                      capitol operations division
    The FY24 budget request includes a $659,000 increase to enable the 
Senate Recording Studio to provide closed captioning services for 
Senate Committee Hearings, a $50,000 increase to allow us to replace 
equipment in the cabinetry shop, and a $5,000,000 increase in no-year 
funding to enable the SAA to replace audiovisual equipment and systems 
in Senate Hearing Rooms at, or near, the end of its serviceable life. 
There are no FTE requests in Capitol Operations for FY24.
Appointment Desk
    Appointment Desk requests level funding to support the network of 
Appointment Desks located on the first floor of the Capitol, the 
basements of Russell and Hart, and the Congressional Visitor Center. 
The Appointment Desk is utilizing updated software to more efficiently 
assist Senate offices in registering and welcoming official business 
visitors.
Capitol Facilities
    During the pandemic, in addition to the standard nightly cleaning 
services, the Environmental Services Division procured and used 
advanced equipment and chemicals to disinfect offices, restrooms, and 
hallways. Our Cabinet Shop builds and maintains furniture for the 
Senate Chamber and Capitol offices, and we are requesting an additional 
$50,000 in FY24 to cover the cost of equipment replacement.
Doorkeepers
    Level funding is requested for the Senate Doorkeepers. The 
Doorkeepers provide access to those with Senate floor privileges; 
enforce the rules of the Senate floor; and facilitate the needs of 
Senators, Senate floor staff, and Senate Pages. The Doorkeepers serve 
in key roles for special events at the Capitol, including 
inaugurations, joint sessions of Congress, and swearing-in and lying-
in-state ceremonies. Further, they ensure the Senate chamber is 
prepared in the event of an emergency.
Media Galleries
    Level funding is requested to support the Senate's four media 
galleries. The media galleries serve as liaisons between the media and 
the Senate community and coordinate press coverage of hearings, news 
conferences, stakeouts, and other media events in the Capitol and 
Senate office buildings. Gallery staff support press logistics at many 
high-profile hearings and events, including the Presidential 
Inauguration, Impeachments, State of the Union, and Swearing in of new 
Senators.
Periodical Press
    The Senate Periodical Press Gallery (Senate PPG) assists over one 
thousand correspondents working for magazines, newsletters, non-daily 
newspapers, or online publications and serves Members of Congress and 
Congressional staff with any periodical press-related questions or 
issues.
Daily Press
    The Senate Press Gallery staff supports those reporters who work 
for daily newspapers and online publications. The gallery's first 
responsibility--since the House and Senate assigned press accreditation 
to the Standing Committee of Correspondents more than 140 years ago--
has always been the maintenance of high standards of journalistic 
independence. In 2021, the Senate Daily Press Gallery credentialed 
approximately 1,500 correspondents. At a time when the media landscape 
is rapidly changing, the Standing Committee of Correspondents relies on 
this Gallery staff to supply the research and the institutional 
judgment needed for tough and, sometimes, precedent-setting decisions 
about credential applications.
    Gallery staff continues to innovate how best to serve its 
constituency. An example is the Gallery's Twitter presence. The @Senate 
press currently has over 27,000 followers, an increase of approximately 
10,000 from the previous year.
Press Photographers
    The Press Photographers Gallery supports press photographers 
representing news organizations from across the United States and 
around the world. Their chief responsibility is to be a liaison between 
news photographers and Congress. Under the guidance of the Standing 
Committee of Press Photographers, staff research new credential 
applications, certify credential renewal requests and issue credentials 
to bona fide news photographers. Staff ensures news photographers have 
the access, information and representation to effectively cover 
Congress, while the Gallery provides filing, office and storage space 
for credentialed press photographers.
Radio & TV
    The Senate Radio and Television Gallery is the office where the 
radio and television correspondents work when they cover the Senate. 
Correspondents from major news outlets occupy work areas in the gallery 
daily. Gallery staff serve as liaisons between Congressional offices 
and members of the electronic news media. Gallery staff work closely 
with Senate staff and more than 4,000 credentialed members of the 
electronic media to facilitate coverage of Senate news events in and 
around the Capitol. Senate staff relies on the Gallery's personnel for 
information on legislative business and press conference details in the
Gallery's state-of-the-art studio.
    The Gallery staff is also responsible for maintaining the media 
technical infrastructure in Senate committee hearing rooms and other 
news event locations throughout the Senate campus. For example, last 
year the gallery staff oversaw the completion of a maintenance program 
of all Senate media fiber that exists throughout the Senate office 
buildings and in the Capitol. The maintenance program included 
upgrading old fiber optic cables to new ones in order to extend the 
current fiber network's lifecycle.
Senate Recording Studio (SRS)
    The Senate Recording Studio monitors, maintains and repairs the 
audio-visual systems in all hearing rooms across the Senate campus. In 
FY24, the Recording Studio requests a $659,000 increase for committee 
closed captioning services. Closed captioning services provide real 
time closed captioning of the committee broadcast for the deaf and hard 
of hearing. This service ensures the Senate is compliant with the 21st 
Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAAA) and allows 
all constituents the ability to participate in Senate hearings. This 
increase allows the Senate to provide captioning to constituents in the 
same manner they receive captioning from networks.
    The FY24 budget request also includes a $5,000,000 increase in no-
year funding to enable the SAA to replace audiovisual equipment and 
systems in Senate Hearing Rooms at, or near, the end of its serviceable 
life. The SRS plans to make targeted replacements of 3 to 4 systems per 
year as they age. The SAA is working towards several targeted 
replacements in FY23 and FY24, including systems in SH-562 and SDG-50, 
as well as central ``press system'' components. At the same time, the 
SAA is working with the AOC on an ongoing program for the complete 
renovation of hearing rooms, starting with SD-342 and continuing with 
SD-406. To date, the SAA has completed a targeted replacement of audio/
video teleconferencing equipment in SR-188, as well as broadcast 
cameras in SD-106 and SH-216 and a large replacement of audio and 
control systems in SH-216 and the full renovation of the Commerce 
hearing room (SR-253), the Intel Hearing Room (SH-219), and the Senate 
SCIF (SVC 217). This ongoing effort to renovate hearing rooms will 
continue in FY24.
    The request also includes funding for the ongoing support of 
Recording Studio services to Senators, committees, SAA and Secretary of 
the Senate offices. During 2022, the Senate Recording Studio broadcast 
987 hours of gavel-to-gavel coverage of Senate floor proceedings and 
recorded the proceedings for subsequent archiving. The Recording Studio 
broadcasted, streamed, recorded, and archived 601 hearings. They also 
produced 514 TV studio shows and 716 Radio shows/services. ``In the 
field'' SRS supported 87 events, some of which were Statue Dedications, 
Police Graduations, a Capitol Police Memorial Dedication, a Gold Medal 
Ceremony, press conferences and other various events on/around Capitol 
Hill. The Video Post-Production Department (Tape Room) fulfilled 442 
orders, as well as completed 172 hours of editing.
    Priorities for the SRS consist of the replacement of critical 
infrastructure within studio spaces including video switching, routing, 
and audio mixing systems installed in 2008, which are now near or, in 
some cases, past the end of their serviceable life. These replacements 
ensure the SRS provides exceptional support in each of its functional 
areas.
                    chief information officer (cio)
    In the FY24 budget request, the CIO is requesting an increase of 
$2,945,000 and three FTEs for Cybersecurity, $5,181,000 and three FTEs 
to enhance the posture of the modern and geographically separated data 
centers, $5,493,000 and two FTEs to directly support the modernization 
and replacement of the Senate's Asset Manager application, complete the 
final phase of the Legislative Systems Amendment Tracking System, 
migrate and improve TranSAAct, and expand the capabilities of new 
secure cloud applications.
    Additionally, the CIO is requesting one Senior System Engineer FTE 
to support the increase in vendors and projects within the Constituent 
Systems and Services team. The CIO is requesting an additional $550,000 
to support the final year of the five-year plan to ensure adequate 
funds are available to support the Senate office's technology needs 
through the Economic Allocation Fund (EAF). EAF supports the 
acquisition of supported hardware and software for Senators, 
committees, leadership, and support offices. Finally, the CIO is 
requesting an additional two FTEs to better support and manage large-
scale projects for the Senate, and to more effectively manage cloud 
licenses within the Senate environment.
Senate Cybersecurity
    Cybersecurity is a critical priority for the SAA, which ensures the 
Senate network, cloud services, and data remain secure so the Senate 
can conduct its Legislative business. The CIO is requesting an increase 
of $2,945,000 and an additional three FTEs for the Cybersecurity 
Department. The SAA proactively defends the Senate network daily 
against advanced cyber threats. The Cybersecurity Department has 
successfully mitigated critical events and ensured the security of the 
Senate due to the dedicated staff and sophisticated technologies 
deployed on the Senate network. To build on these successes, the CIO is 
requesting FTEs for two Cybersecurity Apprentices and one Threat 
Intelligence Cybersecurity Senior Specialist. While phishing continues 
to be a primary motivation of the advanced cybersecurity adversary, 
threat intelligence has revealed a renewed adversary interest in 
performing denial-of-service and ransomware attacks against 
organizations to deny access to their network or more importantly, 
their data.
    For FY24, we will be focused on three main lines of effort: (1) 
continued emphasis on resilience assessments for offices; (2) 
collaboration with Executive Branch Threat Intelligence partners such 
as the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the National Cyber 
Investigative Joint Task Force, and the Department of Homeland Security 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Joint Cyber Defense 
Collaborative; and (3) Zero Trust efforts, to include continued 
maturation of the cybersecurity model of securely accessing data 
located in modern cloud services.
    Leveraging the previously developed Cybersecurity Resilience 
Assessment Methodology, the Department will use this methodology to 
perform an estimated 175 coordinated annual assessments against 
offices, committees, and critical systems to protect against denial of 
service and ransomware attacks. The SAA made great strides to build 
collaborative relationships with Executive Branch threat intelligence 
agencies, and in FY24, the Department will focus on integrating 
cybersecurity threat intelligence staff directly with our intelligence 
partners to continue to mature information-sharing processes and 
procedures to better protect the Senate. As the Senate continues to 
migrate services to the cloud, the Cybersecurity Department will 
continue to focus on building the procedures and technologies to 
accurately evaluate the level of risk associated with using these 
modern services.
Enhancing the Technical Resilience of the Senate
    Following the events of January 6, 2021, and the ever-evolving 
threat landscape, enhancing the technical resiliency of the Senate 
remains a key area of focus. The CIO oversees the engineering, 
implementation, and operations for the Senate's information technology 
continuity and disaster recovery programs, as well as emergency and 
secure communications. This includes the Senate's radio infrastructure, 
communications security, mobile command vehicles, satellite 
communications, data center continuity, and support for National 
Security Special Events.
    In FY24, the CIO will enhance communications capabilities for 
Senators and staff by purchasing DoD-Mobility Classified Capability-Top 
Secret (DMCC-TS) devices and provision services via the Defense 
Information Systems Agency. This capability offers a mobile solution to 
receive classified information when traveling, or when not in the 
proximity of a fixed secure communication device. The CIO will also 
focus on critical emergency communications efforts designed to better 
protect the Senate's staff and resources to include the Joint Audible 
Warning System (JAWS) and Joint Emergency Mass Notification System 
(JEMNS). We are requesting $2,000,000 in no-year funds to support the 
proposed cost increase due to supply chain issues and modification to 
the original scope which increased from three to five transmitter sites 
to increase the coverage area and ensure redundancy. Additionally, the 
CIO will work to enhance the data center posture and strategic 
satellite communications capabilities of the Senate, to ensure a 
redundant and secure means of communication during a disruptive event.
    The CIO is requesting an increase of $5,181,000 and three FTEs to 
continue to enhance the posture of our modern and geographically 
separated data centers. These data centers provide network 
connectivity, communications, and centralized support of the virtual 
server environment for Senate data and applications. They will support 
the growth of office and vendor-managed systems and applications, such 
as Constituent Services Systems, which are being migrated into the 
Senate data centers and enterprise to improve the performance, 
security, and resiliency of these systems and applications.
    The Senate's public-facing websites and applications are in high 
demand and an attractive cyber target for adversaries. The funding 
request also includes expanded reliable hosting capacity for Senate 
websites to defend against denial-of-service attacks and state-of-the-
art toolsets to quickly detect and remediate atypical activity 
occurring on Senate websites and applications such as attempts to gain 
access to data or alter a website's content. There is a cost to 
resiliency and this request reflects that reality.
Modernizing Technical Services to Better Serve Our Customers
    Modernizing technical services is critical to enhancing the 
Senate's ability to work effectively and efficiently when preparing and 
passing legislation and communicating with constituents. Funding for 
FY24 will build on current modernization efforts, as well as add new 
capabilities. The focus for FY24 is on two key areas: (1) Legislative 
and Administrative Systems; and (2) Senate Communications.
    The CIO is working closely with the Senate community to modernize 
key legislative and administrative systems. To that end, the CIO is 
requesting an increase of $5,493,000 and two FTEs to directly support 
the modernization and replacement of the Senate's Asset Manager 
application, to complete the final phase of the Legislative Systems 
Amendment Tracking System, and to expand the capabilities of new secure 
cloud applications such as ServiceNow (IT Help Desk Ticketing), 
Cornerstone (recruitment, talent performance and learning management), 
and Kronos (timekeeping and leave management).
    Additionally, the CIO is requesting one Senior System Engineer FTE 
to support the increase in vendors and projects within the Constituent 
Systems and Services team. This critical team is working with new cloud 
vendors to provide modern systems to better serve constituents. This 
same team is credited with delivering the Senate's ``Communicating with 
Congress'' application, which sees a yearly volume of over 11,200,000 
emails between constituents and Senate offices.
    A major effort to implement a modern and secure Senate 
communications platform at both the Capitol Campus, as well as the 
state offices, will be completed in early FY24. The new Unified 
Communications and Collaboration (UCC) system will create a mobile, 
collaborative, secure, and unified environment that is easy to use and 
intuitive for the end-user. The SAA, along with a leading UCC 
integrator, designed a system that supports communication and 
collaboration anytime, anywhere, and on any connected official device. 
This includes voice messaging, voice-to-text transcription, video 
integration, conferencing, common directory, Contact Center, mass 
notification, and enhanced 9-1-1 connectivity. Additionally, the CIO 
leveraged an opportunity to fold the state offices into the UCC effort 
to deliver a cohesive and secure experience for all Senate users. When 
complete, this project will have replaced every desk phone in the U.S. 
Senate, both in Washington, D.C. and in every state office. Because the 
legacy telephony systems must remain operational throughout the 
migration process, FY24 costs include licensing, support, and 
maintenance for legacy components. Once this project is compete, these 
legacy systems will be decommissioned.
    The CIO is requesting an additional $550,000 to support the final 
year of the five-year plan to ensure adequate funds are available to 
support the Senate office's technology needs through the Economic 
Allocation Fund (EAF). EAF supports the acquisition of supported 
hardware and software for Senators, committees, leadership, and support 
offices so that these expenses do not come out of their office budgets 
but are instead paid for by the SAA.
                      executive and staff offices
Employee Assistance Program (EAP)
    An increase of $307,000 and two FTEs is requested in FY24 for EAP, 
which offers a variety of emotional, behavioral, and work-related 
support as well as wellness resources and services to nationwide Senate 
staff, their family members, Senate Pages, and interns. The Senate 
EAP's mission is to bolster resiliency, help ensure psychological 
readiness, and attend to the overall employee and organizational 
wellness.
    In 2022, the EAP addressed the continual increased demand for 
services by hiring an additional full-time EAP counselor, providing 
telehealth and onsite support services, delivering customized trainings 
to requesting Senate offices, and extending the contract of a contract 
counselor in order to efficiently and effectively serve the Senate 
community. This included the expansion of service hours from 8:00 am--
9:00 pm to accommodate multiple time zone and work shifts. In 2022, 
more than 74% of Senate staff accessed EAP services across 90% of 
Senate offices. This was nearly a 30% increase in programmatic 
utilization from 2021. Additionally, 194 employees took an online 
mental health screening; 4,434 employees attended an EAP training 
activity; and 1,749 employees accessed resources for personalized 
information and referrals addressing childcare, parenting, adult care, 
aging, education, legal concerns, and/or financial issues.
    For FY24, we are requesting additional resources to meet the 
continued increase in demand for EAP services. We are looking to hire 
two additional counselors, whose schedules can accommodate increased 
demands for services in various time zones across the country. These 
counselors would provide confidential emotional and behavioral support 
services for Senate employees and their immediate family members 
through a HIPAA compliant virtual platform as well as wellness coaching 
and consultation. Additionally, the requested budget increase is 
intended to fund the phased in development of a whole-health wellness 
program and the expansion of services to state offices. We plan to 
capitalize on already existing U.S. House of Representatives contracts 
to provide nationwide Senate employees access to wellness apps such as 
a meditation app, a food and nutrition app and a fitness challenge app. 
Further, we will look to expand our dependent care resources with the 
availability of limited backup childcare and tutoring services in 
partnership with LifeCare. Research shows that robust wellness programs 
and resources improve health, energize people and positively impact 
productivity and reduce burnout. This compliments the expansion of EAP 
virtual opportunities, programming and support hours to provide a more 
inclusive, engaging service for staff located in state offices. The 
intent of these EAP requests is to minimize barriers to care and meet 
the needs of the Senate community by enabling employees to access 
services in a multitude of ways.
Executive Office
    An increase of two FTEs is requested to support the Executive 
Office. One FTE is for an attorney who will review matters impacting 
internal procedures and operations including compliance with Senate 
Ethics, and the Congressional Accountability Act. A second FTE is for a 
legislative liaison to work with Senate Offices and Senate Committees 
on a wide range of initiatives, including organizing monthly oversight 
meetings and ensuring required reports and information requests are on 
time and fully responsive.
Human Resources (HR)
    An increase of five FTEs is requested to support the Human 
Resources department to support the SAA's endeavors in modernizing and 
improving employee relations, HR system management, recruitment efforts 
in support of Senate Offices, as well as establishment and support of 
the new Fellowship Program.
    As our employees increase, the work of the Human Resources 
Department also increases. Our HR Department is requesting a software 
specialist to serve as the subject matter expert for our new HR 
software program, Cornerstone, a Recruitment Coordinator to assist 
Senate Offices and Committees through the Senate Employment Office, a 
division of SAA's HR Department, and an Employee Relations Specialist 
who can assist in conducting and overseeing employee relations 
investigations into employee concerns. We are also requesting two FTE's 
in support of the new Senate fellowship program. We need to hire a 
Program Manager and a Recruitment and Placement Coordinator in support 
of the McCain-Mansfield Fellowship Program, as established under Senate 
Resolution 443 (117th Congress) and the SFC Sean Cooley and SPC 
Christopher Horton Congressional Gold Star Fellowship Program, as 
established under Senate Resolution 442 (117th Congress).
Inauguration Support
    The SAA is requesting $500,000 in funding to support the 60th 
Inaugural Ceremonies. The SAA provides ongoing support to the Joint 
Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. We rent large-scale video boards, 
take the inaugural photographs presented to the President and Vice 
President, develop and maintain event and credentialing software, 
assist with Printing and Graphics, signage, parking, campus access, and 
support credentialing of staff press and contractors working in the 
Capitol on Inauguration Day. We are honored to provide this support to 
the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies but we do 
incur expenses including overtime. Based on prior costs, we are 
formally requesting funds to continue providing these services.
Page Program
    The Page Program requests a permanent increase of $35,000 in FY24 
to replace enrollment software. The current Page Program enrollment 
software does not serve the needs of the program and requires 
significant daily maintenance and communication with new pages to 
ensure paperwork is completed correctly. The new enrollment software 
would increase efficiency, accuracy and security. The Senate Page 
Program provides an opportunity for high school juniors from across the 
nation to witness the legislative process firsthand while learning the 
value of public service. In September 2021, the program welcomed pages 
back to the Senate after an 18-month suspension due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. The Page Program developed a robust pandemic management plan 
requiring routine testing, masking, and other precautions, which 
resulted in few pages testing positive for COVID-19. Page Program staff 
provided comfort care and meals for those pages who became positive. 
The Page Program provides supervision of Pages 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week.
State Office Operations
    For FY24, State Office Operations is requesting $964,000 as a 
permanent base increase for Federal rents, $300,000 in support of our 
secure reception room project, and one additional FTE to lead records 
and data management to support a data-drive approach to delivering 
security and design improvements in state offices.
    We appreciate the Committee's support to adequately fund the state 
office rent program, reimbursement to the General Services 
Administration (GSA) for Federal occupancy agreements, and standard 
increases in Federal Protective Services (FPS) security costs for 
Senate offices housed in Federal buildings. The SAA works closely with 
commercial landlords, the GSA, and the FPS to ensure Senator's 
operational and security preparedness needs are met in their state 
offices. As of March 2023, we support 460 state offices for rental 
payments; renovations; installation, maintenance, and monitoring of 
physical security measures; and emergency supplies and security 
preparedness planning and training.
    In 2022, the SAA completed 151 unique state office projects 
coordinating construction, security, furniture, equipment, and delivery 
of IT services. We are again anticipating a high number of projects, as 
we support numerous Class III transitions expected in the year 
following the mid-term elections. An uptick in work is also expected, 
related to our ongoing efforts to move Senators from facilities with 
minimal security to Federal and commercial buildings that offer better 
access control, guard services, and other important countermeasures. 
Our success in managing the State Office Operations portfolio hinges on 
our close and collaborative working relationship with Senate staff, 
commercial landlords, and Federal partners.
    In 2022, we rolled out a new state office alert and notification 
service for all state staff. This platform uses both artificial 
intelligence and analyst support to quickly monitor, evaluate, and 
release customized emergency notifications to Senators and staff 
working and traveling across the country. The tool is also used in our 
Senate Operations Center to monitor emergency events that may be 
impactful to state office or Senate operations outside of the National 
Capitol Region (NCR). We expect the costs associated with this service 
to rise slightly, as more Senate staff adopt its use and we expand 
services to include mobile duress button features.
    Our partnership with FPS also grew significantly in 2022. The SAA 
and FPS Administrator signed a historic memorandum of agreement (MOA) 
allowing for the use of armed guards (Protective Security Officers-
PSOs) at commercial Senate state offices. FPS will begin authorizing 
facility security assessments and deployment of PSOs at select Senate 
state offices, beginning in FY23 and continuing into FY24.
    We remain committed to ensuring the safety of Senators and staff 
and leaning forward to providing customized security systems, 
monitoring services, and enhanced office security construction designs 
to state offices without affecting Senate office budgets. Currently, 
over 98% of state offices have adopted some level of SAA-recommended 
and funded security enhancements. Our goal is to achieve a 100% 
adoption rate and we will work through FY24 to ensure all offices in 
our state portfolio have access to appropriate levels of security.
    Our team provided initial physical security enhancements for 31 
offices and improved existing security for 52 others in 2022. 
Maintaining security systems in good working order is a priority, and 
to support this effort our team conducted over 622 service calls to 
maintain, repair, and or test and inspect state office physical 
security systems in 2022. In FY24, we will continue supporting state 
office visits to assess security, confirm that all installed equipment 
is in good working order, and ensure the office design meets the 
Senator's operational needs.
    We believe that emergency preparedness training and familiarity 
with security equipment equate to higher levels of compliance and 
readiness. In 2022, the State Office Operations team offered twice-
monthly emergency preparedness webinars and worked closely with USCP on 
state office Security Awareness Briefings. Our team also introduced a 
new SAA-sponsored Stop the Bleed training class, offering both in-
person and virtual learning options. We are evaluating the potential 
deployment of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs), resilient 
communications capabilities, and portable power sources. Our focus on 
state office readiness remains a high priority as we move into FY24.
   office of security, emergency preparedness and continuity (osepc)
    For FY24, OSEPC is requesting an increase of 20 FTE's to provide 
additional support to Senators during travel and with residential 
security assessments, as well as in emergency preparation and 
contingency work, management of parking lots and the SAA fleet, as well 
as additional staff to handle logistics and customer support. We are 
also requesting $2,500,000 in no-year funds for the Senate Residential 
Security Program.
OSEPC Administration
    OSEPC Administration requests two additional FTEs to support the 
development and maintenance for all aspects of the Senate Test, 
Training, and Exercise Program. Work involves coordinating, designing, 
and implementing training and exercises, to include both classified and 
unclassified Senate life-safety and continuity programs. These FTEs 
will also develop annual short and long-term training and exercise 
goals, schedules, and guidance.
Access Control and Transportation
    Access Control and Transportation (ACT) requests five additional 
FTEs to supplement current staffing levels in Parking Operations (4 
FTEs) and Transportation and Fleet (1 FTE).
Identification and Access
    The Identification and Access Office is requesting level funding in 
FY24 for the production of identification badges for Senators and their 
families, staff, interns, Pages, support staff, credentialed 
Congressional press, and liaisons approved by the SAA. The 
Identification and Access Office coordinates with the House of 
Representatives and USCP to ensure badge issuance policies are 
standardized to meet security requirements.
Parking Operations
    Parking Operations is requesting four FTEs in FY24 to will ensure 
adequate coverage of Senate parking lots and associated kiosks, which 
require daily monitoring and issue resolution, as well as maintaining 
presence during construction projects and scheduled events impacting 
the Senate. The Parking Operations office manages space availability in 
Senate parking lots and streets for Senate staff, provides onsite 
customer service and emergency assistance, including jumpstarts, 
vehicle entry, and damage claims. Staff collaborate with the Senate 
Committee on Rules and Administration, USCP, and Architect of the 
Capitol to issue and secure parking for permit holders throughout the 
Senate campus.
    In order to enhance the security and safety of parking areas, 
Parking Operations requested improvements on all five fenced lots, 
including kiosk renovations, barrier installations, and parking 
configuration enhancements. The office also staffs and monitors 
additional parking lots and streets at alternate facilities during 
emergencies and training exercises. Parking Operations will purchase 
additional handheld devices and the necessary software to instantly 
identify vehicles by scanning permit barcodes, capturing photos, 
documenting, and printing parking violations or other associated 
issues.
Transportation and Fleet Operations
    The Transportation and Fleet Office is requesting one additional 
FTE to cover the increased requests for vehicle transports of Senators, 
as well as continued minor maintenance of SAA fleet vehicles and assist 
with the additional coverage of the expanded shuttle bus route.
Emergency Preparedness (EP)
    For FY24, Emergency Preparedness requests a total of three 
additional FTEs. One FTE will join the Emergency Equipment team to 
enhance its ability procure, store, deliver, and life cycle manage over 
20,000 items of emergency equipment supporting the Senate community. 
The remaining two FTEs will perform duties supporting both classified 
and unclassified life safety planning, including Disaster Response and 
Recovery, community outreach, and initiatives. These two FTE will 
enhance SAA EP customer focused efforts to ensure the safety of Senate 
community members.
    Annual activities performed by SAA EP include, but are not limited 
to, focusing on the needs of the Senate community by (1) helping 
develop and update individual Senate and Committee office emergency 
action plans, and continuity of operations plans; (2) identifying 
evacuation routes, relocation areas, and internal relocation sites, 
including coordinating with Capitol Police for the safety and movement 
of mobility challenged individuals during emergencies; (3) acquiring, 
distributing, managing and providing training on the use of emergency 
equipment; (4) delivering virtual and self-paced learning for the 
Senate community to take at their convenience; and (5) conducting 
multiple drills and exercises designed to increase the Senate 
community's preparedness to respond to and recover from emergencies.
Contingency Programs (CP)
    For FY24, SAA CP requests level funding and two additional FTEs. 
One FTE will focus on the logistical activities associated with 
managing contingency facilities, resources, and supplies, including 
individual office and committee continuity fly-away kits. This position 
will also create and maintain accurate records of inventory and develop 
plans to execute deployment and distribution of equipment and supplies 
to relocation sites, as well as perform inspections and walkthroughs of 
contingency facilities and monitor and report on the status of Senate 
continuity resources and capabilities. The second FTE will perform 
analytical and planning duties under the supervision. As the continuity 
portfolio continues to grow and mature across the spectrum, additional 
planner support is needed to manage the increasing number of 
unclassified and classified capabilities.
Member Outreach and Security Coordination (MOSC)
    The two FTEs requested will respond to the increased demand for 
security support to Senators and staff in the District of Columbia (DC) 
and state offices. Support includes security awareness briefings for 
Senators and staff, arranging security escorts for Senators during 
travel, and coordinating with local law enforcement for events in the 
home State.
    MOSC engaged in active outreach and discussions regarding active 
threats and criminal cases directed at Senators and staff, and use a 
suite of online tools to monitor social media for actionable threats 
against Senators and reports them to law enforcement. MOSC also 
participates in security awareness briefings for Senate office staff 
alongside USCP counterparts and develops security training for Senators 
and staff. Working with USCP, they provide offices with a final product 
highlighting the overall threat level, specific areas of concern, and 
local law enforcement contact information.
    Through an extensive outreach initiative, MOSC has completed 
approximately 1,228 law enforcement coordination and assessment 
requests, 2,182 law enforcement escort and travel notification 
requests, and 98 rest overnight notifications and enhanced patrols 
during FY22. The total number of travel escort support jumped from 
1,581 requests in 2021, to nearly 2,200 in 2022. This represents a 40% 
increase, and we are on track to exceed those total requests in FY24. 
The SAA will benefit from an additional specialist by ensuring 
Senators' security requests are handled in a timely manner, beyond core 
business hours.
Security, Planning and Police Coordination (SPPC)
    The new Senate Residential Security Program will assist with the 
costs and coordination of certain residential security upgrades to 
reinforce the security of Senators and their families. We request four 
additional FTEs to support this endeavor. These additional personnel 
would manage the program and its related financial and administrative 
requirements. We are requesting a fifth FTE to help monitor and plan 
for the large volume of ongoing security projects on the Congressional 
campus.
    Our efforts during 2022 included coordinating 1,402 Senate campus 
access requests including security coverage for 525 committee hearings 
and 117 Senate-specific security support requests, such as security 
sweeps and security modifications of office space. Further, SPPC 
partnered with the USCP to support 17 residential security assessments 
for Senators. This team also conducts bi-monthly Security Awareness 
Briefings for the Senate staff.
Senate Operations Center (SOC)
    I've already discussed the new SOC and its role as the information 
and situational awareness hub for the Senate Community. The SOC is 
currently staffed with a Director, Watch Manager, three two-person 
watch teams, and an administrative support specialist. For FY24, the 
SOC requests level funding and one additional FTE to perform duties as 
the SOC Information Management Specialist (IMS). The IMS is a technical 
professional who maintains technology systems and applications and 
provides training on the SOC's incident management, knowledge 
management, situational awareness, Geospatial Information Systems 
(GIS), communications, and information technology (IT) platforms and 
solutions. The IMS will develop, maintain, and train SOC and other SAA 
staff as needed on situational awareness solutions using GIS platforms 
for real time situational awareness. The addition of this position will 
allow SOC Watch standers to devote all efforts to the SOC primary 
mission while the IMS ensures the SOC possesses and is trained on the 
necessary technology and tools to be successful.
                           support operations
    The FY24 budget request for Support Operations includes $4,000,000 
for Facilities Management and $171,000 and two FTEs for Photographic 
Services.
Facilities Management
    Facilities Management requests a $4,000,000 increase to support the 
move out cost from the Postal Square building. The occupancy agreement 
for the Postal Square building expires in May 2024 and Facilities 
Management is working with the Architect of the Capitol and the General 
Services Administration to identify space for support staff. Following 
a recent internal workspace survey, the amount of space required will 
be approximately two-thirds less than what is currently occupied. We 
are hopeful that new space will be in close proximity of Capitol Hill, 
which will allow us to utilize the current shuttle infrastructure 
offered by Fleet and Transportation Services.
Photographic Services
    Photographic Services requests $171,000 and two FTEs in FY24 to 
provide photo-imaging services for Senate offices and committees. The 
SAA Photographic Services team manages and maintains a unified digital 
photo browser application that provides Senate offices with a secure, 
accessible archive of all photos accumulated during a Senator's term in 
office. Currently, the photo browser contains more than 1.5 million 
photo image files. Having surveyed Senate offices, Photographic 
Services is finalizing the procurement of a new photo browser, which 
will be more modern and customer friendly. This will give the Senate 
community access to a unified repository of photographs with the 
ability to order a preexisting or uploaded image. In FY22, our staff 
covered 3,307 assignments, photographing over 92,000 images, and 
producing more than 25,000 photo prints. In FY24, Photographic Services 
looks to purchase new camera kits with improved technology that 
facilitates real-time transmission of imagery to Senate customers. This 
new functionality will provide high-quality, professional imagery to 
Senate staff during key events, which compliments their growing demand 
of social media and mass communication content.
Joint Office of Training & Development
    The Joint Senate Office of Training and Development (T&D) requests 
level funding to provide employee training and development 
opportunities for Senate learners. There are two sections within the 
department: Technical and Performance Skills Training along with Health 
Promotion. Technical trainers provide documentation and training for 
Senate-supported software packages through instructor-led classes, one-
on-one coaching sessions, and demos. Performance skills trainers 
provide courses, one-on-one coaching, and facilitation for all Senate 
staff in areas including management and leadership development, staff 
development, and office/team development. Training & Development will 
design and implement additional online resources for training through 
the new Cornerstone software suite of tools, which will allow Senate 
staff to optimize efficiencies across departments working on 
performance, learning, compensation, and succession.
    The mandated Health Promotion section provides activities and 
events for the Senate community that promote healthy living. Each year, 
this section coordinates and hosts the two-day Wellness Fair, which 
supports on average 3,000 participants. The fair offers health 
promotion activities, such as screening for glucose, cholesterol, and 
blood pressure; exercise demonstrations; and seminars on topics 
including healthy eating and cancer prevention. In addition, Health 
Promotion serves the Senate community by hosting four blood drives each 
year and providing quarterly Stop the Bleed training.
Printing, Graphics & Direct Mail
    Printing, Graphics and Direct Mail (PGDM) request level funding in 
FY24. This department plays a role in constituent mail and newsletters, 
printing Floor Charts, document digitization and preservation, 
logistics, and secure offsite transfer of Senate material.
    PGDM is focused on providing services to Senate offices that 
enhance the customer experience and respond to customer needs. Direct 
XPress, an innovative web-to-print storefront solution, has enhanced 
the customer experience of ordering services from PGDM and has cut 
processing time by 90%, saving time, money, and supplies.
    PGDM has worked with the Secretary of the Senate, the House of 
Representatives, and the Architect of the Capitol to streamline the 
steps related to flying flags over the Capitol. The Layout and Design 
Tem has created a user-friendly template in Direct Xpress to allow 
offices to order flags, easily search and retrieve orders, proof their 
certificates online and send the necessary forms to all stakeholders. 
So far, this fiscal year, 33 Senate offices ordered 405 flag 
certificates.
    Our Digital mail service is in high demand and utilized by eighty 
offices. PGDM's heat press, which generates professional quality 
products, such as table coverings, to provide Senate offices with 
better visibility at Town Hall meetings and other events has been used 
by 18 Senate offices for a total of 89 custom-printed table coverings.
Senate Post Office
    The Post Office requests level funding and continued support of a 
security maintenance contract at the offsite mail screening facility. 
In FY22 and FY23, new and enhanced security video equipment has been 
installed at the off-campus Mail Screening facility. The enhanced, and 
newly added cameras, provide additional and newly added cameras, 
provide additional functionality with clearer imagery, storage, and 
zoom capabilities. Other features include remote viewing capabilities, 
which could be utilized by USCP during an HMRT response, and an ability 
to capture clearer images of mail processed within the bio-safety 
cabinets. The new cameras and DVR provide necessary components in 
ensuring employee safety for Post Office staff and USCP First 
Responders.
    Within the Senate Post Office, staff screens and delivers mail and 
packages to more than 180 locations within the Capitol complex, while 
providing a messenger service to multiple locations throughout the 
Washington metropolitan area. In FY22, the Post Office safely processed 
and delivered more than 4.9 million incoming mail items, while 
intercepting 17 suspicious mailings that required an immediate response 
by the USCP. We prevented the delivery of an additional 734 suspicious 
mailings that required further scrutiny by USCP.
    During the pandemic, in conjunction with the United States Postal 
Service, the Senate Post Office established a free forwarding service 
for state offices to enable them to forward state office mail to DC for 
security screening, or to forward mail to a centralized location in 
their state and 51 offices now use this service. In addition, the 
Senate Post Office sorts mail for 78 Senate and Committee offices and 
delivers their mail to PGDM to be digitally imaged and returned to the 
office electronically.
                               conclusion
    Thank you for your support of the SAA and for the opportunity to 
discuss the SAA's accomplishments and our FY24 budget request. This 
budget remains focused on my three core responsibilities: the security 
and safety of Senators and staff, constituents and visitors; the 
security and reliability of the enterprise network that allows all of 
us to do our work; and innovative solutions to support the needs of the 
Senate community.

    Senator Reed. Thank you, General.
    Chief Manger, please.
                                ------                                


                      UNITED STATES CAPITOL POLICE

STATEMENT OF CHIEF J. THOMAS MANGER, CHIEF OF POLICE, 
            UNITED STATES CAPITOL POLICE
    Chief Manger. Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Fischer, 
Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to 
present the United States Capitol Police Budget Request for 
fiscal year 2024. The Department greatly appreciates the 
subcommittee's consistent support of the men and women of the 
United States Capitol Police.
    Congress' support has been invaluable in providing the 
resources needed to continue our transformation into a 
stronger, more protection-oriented law enforcement agency, 
while meeting dramatic workload increases in an increasingly 
volatile threat environment.
    The Capitol Police is unique among Federal law enforcement 
agencies, we patrol a Campus that is completely open, and now 
that the Campus is fully reopened we again host millions of 
visitors each year, all the while investigating evolving and 
increasing threats against Members of Congress and their 
families. The 2024 budget request reflects this reality.
    In my testimony today I will present the fiscal year 2024 
budget requests within the context of three general themes that 
explain the Department's forward trajectory. First, the 
enduring impact of all the deficiencies identified in the 
Inspector General's reports over the last two-and-a-half years; 
second, the Department's future challenges and continued 
transformation; and third, the need to usher in a new phase of 
protective policing.
    First, I asked the Committee to understand that even with 
our recent staffing increases we remain significantly 
understaffed for an agency that has nationwide jurisdiction and 
responsibilities, and a growing mission, and increasing 
workload. Therefore, our past two budgets have been attempts to 
work toward right-sizing the Department by elevating its 
budgetary baseline to a more normalized level.
    The fiscal year 2024 budget request incorporates a critical 
request to expand dignitary protection, our threat 
investigations, and enhance security operations for the Members 
of Congress and their families, both in D.C., and in their home 
districts.
    Within the 2024 budget request, the Department is asking 
for increased salaries to fund 2,126 sworn employees at a full-
year rate, and 78 sworn employees at half-year. The budget 
request also includes funding for 555 civilian employees at a 
full-year rate, and 81 civilians at a half-year rate. The 
general expense request is $228.6 million. The total fiscal 
year 2024 budget increase is $106.3 million.
    I fully recognize the Department's requested increase is 
significant, but equally significant are the Department's 
growing responsibilities and challenges. The fact is, we engage 
in a no-fail mission every day, recognizing that there will be 
no tolerance for leadership or organizational failures. The 
Department's 2024 budget request reflects the reality that as 
the Department's mission and environment changes and evolves 
so, too, must its staffing and resources.
    Therefore, I want to highlight six areas that continue to 
be central to our growth and transformation. They are: expanded 
dignitary protection capabilities, continued normalization of 
sworn and civilian staffing levels, enhanced intelligence 
capabilities, expanded capabilities to address threats against 
members, cybersecurity and investigative activity, expanded 
physical and technical security capabilities to secure the 
Capitol Complex, and strengthen training capabilities for 
recruit officers, in-service training, physical skills, 
professional and leadership development.
    Over the last year the world has continuously changed, 
becoming more violent and uncertain. A member of Congress was 
brutally assaulted, and the husband of the former House Speaker 
was critically wounded in a politically motivated attack. 
Increasingly, sophisticated cyber tools are more widely 
available to malicious actors who employ them to infiltrate 
data networks and steal private information. The sheer increase 
in the numbers of threats against Members of Congress, 
approximately 400 percent over the past 6 years, requires new 
and innovative techniques, to identify, deter, and mitigate 
threats.
    Upcoming elections, the political conventions, and the 
campaign activities that go along with them, and the 
increasingly heated political rhetoric, further heighten the 
prospect of future security risks and challenges. We must 
adequately--we must be adequately staffed to handle these 
events. We are not currently.
    The United States Capitol Police traditional model of law 
enforcement no longer applies to the current landscape, the old 
approach to member security has been replaced by the need to 
protect the member's environment, as well as the member's 
family, both in Washington, D.C., and at their home.
    Keeping you and your family safe is a paramount objective. 
There is, in fact, a new normal for our Protective Operations. 
The fiscal year 2024 budget request will allow the Department 
to transition to the next phase of its transformation.
    I thank the Committee for its support, and greatly 
appreciate our continued partnership with the Congress.
    We welcome any questions or comments.

  Prepared Statement of J. Thomas Manger Chief, United States Capitol 
                                 Police
    Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Fischer, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the United 
States Capitol Police (USCP or Department) budget request for Fiscal 
Year 2024 (FY 2024 budget request). The Department greatly appreciates 
the Subcommittee's consistent support of the women and men of the U.S. 
Capitol Police, who courageously carry out their duties of protecting 
the Members of Congress, the Capitol Complex, and the legislative 
process each and every day. Congress' support has been invaluable in 
providing the resources needed to continue our transformation into a 
stronger, more protective-oriented law enforcement agency, while 
meeting dramatic workload increases in an increasing volatile threat 
environment.
    The United States Capitol Police is unique among Federal law 
enforcement agencies. We patrol a campus that is completely open. The 
public has a constitutional right to visit, protest, or do an early 
morning run through this public forum. Our officers work 24/7 to keep 
you safe, whether here on Capitol Hill, when you travel to your home 
districts, or when you travel abroad as part of a Congressional 
delegation. We staff the doors, corridors, plazas, garages, and street 
corners--in sum, every square foot of the Capitol Grounds, which 
includes the Capitol, eight Congressional office buildings, as well as 
three Library of Congress buildings. Prior to the pandemic, the Capitol 
was visited every year by an estimated seven to ten million people from 
around the world. Now that the campus is fully reopened, the Department 
is once again managing this increased level of visitor activity--all 
within the context of evolving and increasing threats against Members 
of Congress and their families. The FY 2024 budget request reflects 
this reality.
    Thanks to the Emergency Security Supplemental Act (Emergency 
Supplemental) and the enacted FY 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act 
funding (FY 2023 budget), the Department was able to direct its efforts 
to bolstering salaries, general expenses, and mutual aid to partner law 
enforcement agencies as a stop-gap measure. These appropriations, while 
invaluable, represented the next step in the U.S. Capitol's evolution, 
not the final destination. Thus, the FY 2024 budget request is 
predicated upon the Department's continued transformation in a post-
January 6, 2021 environment, one increasingly defined by evolving 
technologies, an increased threat climate, and a shift towards a more 
protective model of law enforcement. The Concept of Operations 
strategic plan being developed at Congress' request will further shape 
and define the increased staffing and resources needed to support the 
Department's expanded mission.
    While the Department is not defined by the events of January 6, 
2021, the structural changes and recommendations issued in the 
aftermath continue to impact our resource needs, as do the hiring 
delays and other lingering effects of the pandemic. In my testimony 
today, therefore, I will present the FY 2024 budget request within the 
context of three general themes that explain the Department's forward 
trajectory and support our request for the funding needed to keep us on 
that path:
  1.  The Enduring Impact of January 6 and the Pandemic;
  2.  The Department's Future Challenges and Continued Transformation; 
        and
  3.  The Need to Usher in a New Phase of Protective Policing.
Enduring Impact of January 6 and Pandemic
    In the last 2 years, the Department confronted two events of epic 
proportions that are unprecedented in our nation's history: the January 
6 attack on the Capitol and the coronavirus pandemic. These 
transformative events directly impacted the Capitol community, 
particularly the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police, who 
responded to each crisis with courage and resilience, adjusting and 
pivoting when needed, and within extremely compressed timelines.
    The January 6 attack on the Capitol exposed failures and weaknesses 
within the organization that were profound. The more than dozen after 
action reports shifted the Department's priorities and accelerated the 
timeline for executing them. Working closely with the Congress to 
identify mission requirements in response to the attack, Congress 
appropriated $106.06 million in emergency funding through the Emergency 
Supplemental. This emergency funding allowed the Department to provide 
hazardous duty pay and retention bonuses; increase staffing levels for 
the Intelligence and Interagency Coordination Division; formally 
establish the Howard C. Liebengood Center for Wellness; onboard trauma-
informed Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and wellness specialists; 
procure additional civil disturbance equipment for our sworn officers; 
provide funding for our Dignitary Protection Agents to travel and 
protect Members of Congress; update Department technology to enhance 
intelligence analysis and investigative capabilities; provide iPhones 
to the entire sworn workforce for information dissemination; and 
support Department-wide and specialty training. The emergency 
appropriation also allowed for the installation of physical barriers at 
vulnerable vehicular access points on Capitol Grounds. Congress' 
support at that time cannot be sufficiently overstated--it was 
invaluable.
    The audit and oversight review of the Department's response 
following January 6 was another pivotal point. The Department dedicated 
a significant amount of time and resources to the implementation of 
recommendations issued by the various stakeholders and oversight 
entities, including the USCP Office of Inspector General (OIG), the 
Senate Homeland Security Committee, the General Honore January 6 Task 
Force, and other third party reviewers. The OIG alone issued 
approximately 103 recommendations. Thanks to the Department's sustained 
efforts, and the support of the Congress, the vast majority of 
recommendations issued have been addressed, and those that remain are 
on a glide path to completion. However, with over 2,000 individuals 
currently identified in connection with the attack on the Capitol, 
January 6-related investigations and prosecutions are expected to 
continue for the foreseeable future. This will require a continued 
commitment of Department staffing and resources.
    The pandemic represented another historic and unprecedented event 
that required the USCP to quickly recalibrate and move to an entirely 
new operational and administrative model. While House and Senate office 
buildings were closed to the public, the work of the Congress had to 
proceed unimpeded and within strict pandemic safety protocols. Under 
these circumstances, the men and woman of the USCP performed critical 
job functions with the additional risk of harm to their personal 
health. The Department had to manage delayed recruitment efforts due to 
the closure of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, a move that 
affected the hiring and deployment of new sworn officers--essentially 
bringing our sworn hiring to a halt. Low officer morale, and the 
public's declining confidence in law enforcement, put a further strain 
on the organization. Hiring within law enforcement remains challenging 
in the post-pandemic environment, not just for the Department but 
nation-wide, as men and women consider other options that provide a 
better work-life balance.
Future Challenges and Continued Transformation
    January 6 and the pandemic were unforeseen crises that occurred in 
rapid-fire succession, requiring the Department to act quickly to 
triage operational priorities. Given the exigencies it faced, the 
Department's funding requests were submitted under an accelerated 
timeline and, as a result, the Department's overall resource and 
staffing needs were not sufficiently recognized or addressed internally 
in order to develop more appropriate budget requests. Thus, the FY 2023 
and FY 2024 budget requests reflect a critical reality--that prior to 
January 6, the Department was operating at a reduced staffing and 
resource baseline. Subsequent requests, therefore, have been attempts 
to ``right-size'' the Department by elevating its budgetary baseline to 
a more normalized level, a level that will be further impacted by the 
recommendations contained in the Concept of Operations strategic plan 
under development.
    The FY 2024 budget request incorporates both the lessons learned 
from January 6, as well as the Department's articulation of its vision 
for the future as it moves towards a more protective law enforcement 
model. It reflects the need to improve intelligence functions by 
increasing analytical expertise, and operational planning and support. 
It reflects the need to strengthen physical security, fortify the 
capability of Civil Disturbance front-line responders, enhance 
coordination with National Capitol Region partners, strengthen physical 
infrastructure, and expand dignitary protection and security.
    Within the FY 2024 budget request, therefore, the Department is 
asking for increased Salaries to fund 2,126 sworn employees at a full 
year rate and 78 sworn employees at a half year rate, which equates to 
2,165 full-time sworn employees. The budget request also includes 
funding for 555 civilian employees at a full year rate and 81 civilians 
at a half year rate, which equates to 596 full-time civilian employees. 
The General Expense request is $228.672 million. The total FY 2024 
budget increase is $106,366 million.
    I fully recognize that the Department's requested increase is 
significant. But equally significant are the Department's growing 
responsibilities and challenges. Unlike other law enforcement agencies, 
we have been asked in the last 2 years to develop and implement 
transformational structural and strategic changes within extremely 
accelerated time lines, while simultaneously maintaining the staffing 
and resources needed to carry out the Department's daily core mission. 
And the effort and manpower resource allocation that undergirds these 
efforts are not sufficiently recognized or understood. The opening of 
doors throughout the Congressional Campus exemplifies this challenge. 
Adequately staffing a campus door requires 3 to 4 officers per shift to 
ensure a proper level of security (3 shifts per day, often 5-6 days per 
week.) Long lines are not only an inconvenience to Members, staff, and 
visitors, they represent a security risk that, in these increasingly 
volatile times, the Department must address. While the ``big picture'' 
reforms are significant and important, staffing daily mission 
requirements are vital. We engage in a ``no fail'' mission every day, 
recognizing there is no tolerance for leadership or organizational 
failures post-January 6.
    The Department's FY 2024 budget request reflects the reality that 
as the Department's mission and environment changes and evolves, so too 
must its staffing and resources. Therefore, the U.S. Capitol Police's 
FY 2024 budget request focuses on the nine areas that continue to be 
central to its efforts to grow and transform. They are:
  --  Continued normalization of sworn and civilian staffing levels;
  --  Enhanced intelligence capabilities;
  --  Expanded Dignitary Protection capabilities;
  --  Expanded capabilities to address threats against Members, cyber-
        security, and other investigative activity;
  --  Expanded physical and technical security capabilities to secure 
        the Capitol Complex;
  --  Enhanced event planning, and command and control coordination;
  --  Enhanced response and special operations capabilities;
  --  Strengthened training capabilities for recruit officer, in-
        service, physical skills, professional development, and 
        leadership development; and
  --  Enhanced administrative support infrastructure to support 
        operational and mission-oriented requirements.

    Even in the relatively short time since the FY 2023 budget request 
was submitted, the world has continuously changed, becoming more 
violent and uncertain. A Member of Congress was brutally assaulted and 
the husband of the former House Speaker was critically wounded in a 
politically-motivated attack. Increasingly sophisticated cyber tools 
are more widely available to malicious actors who employ them to 
infiltrate data networks and steal private information. The sheer 
increase in the number of threats against Members of Congress--
approximately 400% over the past 6 years--requires new and innovative 
techniques to identify, deter, and mitigate threats before they 
materialize. Upcoming elections, the campaign activities that precede 
them, and the increasingly heated political rhetoric further heighten 
the prospect of future security risks and challenges.
Ushering In a New Phase of Protective Policing
    The FY 2024 budget request accounts for these growing risks. The 
Department recognizes that new and evolving challenges will continue to 
emerge, rendering it imperative that the USCP be positioned, equipped, 
and resourced to meet and defeat threats to Members of Congress and the 
Capitol Complex. Strategic planning, forward thinking, proactive versus 
reactive policing is the new operational model that is best suited to 
confront the operational challenges facing the Department today and in 
the future. The USCP's traditional model of law enforcement no longer 
applies to the current context. The old approach of Member protection 
has been replaced by the need to protect a Member's environment, as 
well as a Member's family. Keeping you and your families safe is my 
paramount objective.
    The work the Department began prior to January 6, 2021, which has 
since been enhanced and fine-tuned through subsequent appropriations 
and the Congress' support, will allow the Department to transition to 
the next phase of its transformation. Informed by the Concept of 
Operations strategic plan that is under development, the move towards a 
more protective-oriented model of policing will better serve the 
Members of Congress and will increase the safety of the Capitol 
Complex. The Department's proposed reorganization plan complements this 
strategic vision. It exemplifies the reality that a strong 
organizational structure fosters positive change and growth, reinforces 
accountability, internal controls, and employee development. With the 
funding provided by the FY 2024 budget request, the Department will be 
able to successfully transition to the next phase of its evolution, 
further strengthening the ability of the men and women of the U.S. 
Capitol Police to carry out their vital mission.
    While the Department has made significant strides towards right-
sizing Department personnel and pivoting toward a more protective 
operational model, more work remains to be done. Thus, it is critically 
important to maintain this momentum. The USCP has risen to meet 
emerging challenges at every turn, and the FY 2024 budget reflects the 
Department's determination to continue this upward trajectory.
    Madam Chair, we thank the Subcommittee for its support and greatly 
appreciate our continued partnership with the Congress. We welcome any 
questions or comments.

    Senator Reed. Thank you very much, Chief.
    General Gibson, you mentioned modernization efforts that 
you have undertaken. Could you highlight some that you have 
accomplished, and the most significant ones that still have to 
be achieved?
    General Gibson. Certainly, Senator. Thank you. So, some of 
the ones I mentioned appear simple but not always so; such as 
creating portals, a security portal as well as the Direct 
Express portal that allows and facilitates the ordering of 
services from the Sergeant at Arms. The Passport Office is 
another one that I mentioned, as well as some of the tools that 
we are creating for emergency preparedness and accountability.
    I mentioned the Senate Recording Studio renovation that 
will be a modernization project that will continue on an annual 
basis for a number of years. We also have things that we are 
trying to modernize in our Printing, Graphics, and Direct Mail 
division. But one in particular that I would like to mention, 
because it is a heavy lift for our CIO team, is the Unified 
Communications and Collaboration System, or UCC. This is a 
major effort to implement a modern and secure Senate 
communications platform, both on the Capitol campus and at 
State offices across the Nation.
    It will create a mobile, collaborative, secure, and unified 
environment that is easy to use and supports communication and 
collaboration, anytime, anywhere, and on any connected official 
device, to include voice messaging, voice to text, video 
integration, conferencing, common directory, contact center, 
mass notification, and enhance 911 connectivity.
    When a phone rings, or when the phone on my desk rings it 
could ring on my phone in my home. Because our legacy telephony 
systems must remain operational throughout this migration, our 
fiscal year 2024 costs will include licensing, support, and 
maintenance for the legacy components, until they are 
decommissioned with the project's completion next year. That is 
one of the principal modernization efforts that we will be 
undergoing in the year to come.
    Senator Reed. And within this new system there will be a 
significant emphasis on security of the system so that hacking 
and intrusions will be minimized?
    General Gibson. Absolutely. Yes, Senator. And this is part 
of what drives the cost and makes it a more challenging upgrade 
for us, than simply replacing the phones on the desks.
    Senator Reed. And you have been coordinating with the 
Secretary of the Senate team on a number of initiatives. Could 
you give us an idea of those initiatives?
    General Gibson. So one that we are working through is to 
modernize pay processes with the Disbursing Office. That will 
affect all Senate offices and when completed should make life 
much easier for those Senate offices. I think that is perhaps 
the most significant one that we are coordinating with the 
Secretary of the Senate on. Yes.
    Senator Reed. Thank you very much.
    General Gibson. I think--you know, I also mentioned closed 
captioning, that is a modernization effort, and will be a 
capability that constituents, and our broader Senate community 
will benefit from. And that is also a significant ask in our 
budget request for $695,000 to provide that capability.

                          DIGNITARY PROTECTION

    Senator Reed. Thank you very much, General.
    Chief, just a clarification, when you speak of dignitary 
protection, are those visitors to the Capitol, and they are not 
members?
    Chief Manger. No, I am talking about the protection that we 
offer to the leadership, and threat-based details.
    Senator Reed. Yes. So those would be the individuals who 
have basically 24-hour coverage by the Capitol Police.
    Chief Manger. That is correct.

               INTELLIGENCE SHARING WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES

    Senator Reed. I understand. Can you comment on the 
intelligence sharing progress that you have made with other 
Federal agencies? And anything in this budget that would be 
directed at enhancing that sharing?
    Chief Manger. We have hired, about a year ago, a little 
over a year ago, a new Director of Intelligence, he has built, 
what I believe, is a world-class intelligence operation. It 
wasn't a difficult challenge to raise the bar on our 
intelligence operation, but what he has done, I mean in terms 
of our ability to gather intelligence in the first place, to 
share it with other agencies, to operationalize that 
intelligence for our operational planning, and to disseminate 
that information to those who need to have the information, 
have all been--we have put processes in place to do all of 
those things.
    We continue to put members of the U.S. Capitol Police, our 
civilian analysts, in taskforces around the region so that we 
have our folks spread out in the intelligence community to 
ensure that information we have is shared with them, and 
information they have is shared with us. But probably one of 
the most important things to my officers is the fact that 
everyone was issued a cell phone, and they get daily intel 
briefs, every day, over their phone.

                           HIRING CHALLENGES

    Senator Reed. Very good. You mentioned the biggest 
challenge is staffing, and I don't think that is unique to the 
Capitol Police. As I travel throughout Rhode Island, and I am 
sure Senator Fischer, and Senator Murray, hear the first thing. 
Recruitment to Police Department, Fire Department, Public 
Safety organizations, is very, very challenging. Are you 
running into those problems of recruiting?
    Chief Manger. Not as much as my colleagues from around the 
country. And I think that is due to a number of things: That 
the retention bonus that we have been able to offer, and that 
we plan to offer at fiscal year 2024 as well, that has really 
lowered our attrition. But also, the change in the pay scale, 
made us competitive in terms of being able to attract 
applicants in the first place.
    I have put other strategies in place where we have waived 
the mandatory 57-year-old retirement, bumped it up to 60. You 
would be surprised how many folks that are at 57 years old and 
don't want to leave and--or would be willing to stay for a few 
extra years.
    So we have put a lot of strategies in place to reduce 
attrition and increase retention, and I think it is making a 
difference for us.
    Senator Reed. I will just note, 57 is very young in the 
Senate.
    Chief Manger. I will take your word for that, Senator Reed.
    Senator Reed. Thank you. I have a question, but I will wait 
until the second round, General.
    Senator Fischer, please.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    General Gibson, in your opening comments you were talking 
about, in regards to the budget, and new hires, and your 
expansion there, could you--would you like to highlight any of 
those specific new hires? You went through a list of them, but 
could you highlight some and say why you decided that these 
were the hires that you needed?
    General Gibson. Certainly, Senator. As we stand up the 
Residential Security System Program, we are requesting 
specifically five FTEs, that is for a security engineering 
specialist, an expert in physical security enhancements, and 
construction, a financial administrative specialist, since 
there will be a significant amount of money that we deal with 
in this regard, two program managers and a senior program 
manager.
    Some of the other ones that we are asking----
    Senator Fischer. Do you see that program growing in the 
future?
    General Gibson. I do not see it--we are estimating perhaps 
a participation rate of 50 percent, and you know, it is going 
well so far. Actually, approximately half of the senators who 
are currently in office have had residential security 
assessments. In the last year--or this year alone, I think we 
have had 25, and another 12 who have requested them.
    So the interest in having the surveys and receiving the 
recommendations has been strong, but I don't know that we will 
see it grow, and increase, you know, once one has a duress 
button----
    Senator Fischer. The set up--instead?
    General Gibson. Yes. Yes. But it is not something that I 
would see us asking for additional people for in out years.
    Senator Fischer. Okay.
    General Gibson. Yes. Some of the other requests that we 
have made, we have two for our emergency preparedness team that 
will be replacing the escape hoods, Victim Rescue Units, and 
the emergency supply kits around the Capitol buildings. Two, 
for our continuity programs to help ensure that we are prepared 
to execute Enduring Constitutional Government functions; two, 
for our member outreach and security coordination; for things 
like, law enforcement coordination and, transportation security 
requests.
    And in particular, as the Department stands up and moves 
towards this stronger protective operations capacity for our 
Senators, writ large, to look at their personal security, I 
would probably seek to have an embed in the Protective 
Intelligence Operations Center, much as we have now on the 
seventh floor in the Command Center.
    Senator Fischer. When you talk about the Operations Center, 
the Senate Operations Center; what is your vision for that? And 
how does that request align with it?
    General Gibson. So we have a Senate Operations Center now, 
Senator. The only additional request I am making there is for 
an information manager. The personnel are on board and fully 
hired for our Senate Operations Center, which is complementary 
to the Capitol Police Command Center, and focuses specifically 
on Senate needs and communication with the Senate community.
    In the future, as the Department stands up a broader 
protective operations capacity, we will perhaps take someone 
who is already resident in our staff, and position them there.
    Senator Fischer. Okay. You have also, in your opening 
comments; you were talking about our State offices.
    General Gibson. Yes.
    Senator Fischer. And staff, and the physical and cyber 
security that is needed there. You described some of the 
opportunities, such as the setup in the basement of Russell. 
Are there any other initiatives, or ongoing work that you are 
doing with our State offices at this time?
    General Gibson. I am very proud of our State Office 
Operations Center, and the demonstration room has just been 
terrific. I very much appreciate the support from the Rules 
Committee, and others, to allow us to do that. And really to 
reach out to senators directly to show them some of the 
enhancements that they could have in their State offices. That 
team is very responsive to emerging requirements, whether it is 
flooding, wildfires, and other things. And most recently they 
have been fielding satellite radios, or satellite communication 
devices to senators for use in emergencies in some of those 
State offices, in the event of an emergency that takes out 
communications.
    We also are working with them on capabilities to identify, 
in very short time, threats to Senate offices in the vicinity 
there, whether it is a violent activity of some kind, a 
building lock down, a fire, or whatever. And these are some of 
the initiatives that we have been pursuing.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you.

                         TRAINING IMPROVEMENTS

    Chief Manger, in your budget request there is a section 
that details open GAO and Inspector General recommendations, 
and several of those instruct the Department to provide 
additional, more realistic and hands-On training for your 
officers. In your budget request, how does that align with the 
priority to provide better training for your officers?
    Chief Manger. So we have recently begun doing active 
shooter training in the Senate and House Office buildings 
themselves, as well as the Capitol. This is exactly what the 
recommendation talked about, training where folks are actually 
working.
    In addition to that, we have gotten a number of, what we 
call ``virtual machines'', they are virtual training pods where 
we can do any number of--types of training, whether it is use 
of force, whether it is de-escalation, any number of different 
kinds of training that can be done with the virtual machines.
    So we are ensuring that with--even with the staffing levels 
that we have, that we are able to train officers without 
actually removing them from their posts and making them go to 
the Academy, we are trying to do the training here, on the 
Campus, which allows us more options.

                        SWORN WORK-LIFE BALANCE

    Senator Fischer. And you know, when we arrive here in the 
morning, we see your officers greeting us every day when we 
come to work, and we form relationships with them. When we look 
at the needs that they have, and to really take time off to 
spend time with their families, how do you balance the 
personnel to be able to take those scheduled leaves, and be 
able to use their overtime to address these mission 
requirements?
    Chief Manger. So this has been the--one of the main reasons 
we have tried to increase our staffing levels over the past 
several years, because we still are forcing officers to work 
overtime that they wouldn't necessarily volunteer for. We are 
holding them over at the end of their shifts, you know, 
canceling days off to make sure we have enough folks for a 
particular event.
    And I know that this is not a sustainable strategy. And the 
only way we are going to be able to fix that is to get our 
staffing levels up to what I have asked for in fiscal year 
2024, so that we will have the ability to ensure officers get 
their days off, and have the--that appropriate work-life 
balance.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you.
    Senator Reed. Chairwoman Murray, please.
    Senator Murray. Thank you. Thank you Chair Reed, and 
Ranking Member Fischer. Delighted to join you today as we 
continue to work to return to regular order for the first time 
in years, and pass our funding bills in a responsible way.
    This hearing is really an important opportunity to make 
sure we are providing the people who protect us, and our 
staffs, and our Nation's Capitol, with the resources that they 
need.
    Sergeant at Arms Gibson, I would like to thank you and your 
team for the dedication you all show each and every day, your 
office plays a really crucial role keeping the work of the 
people running smoothly, and we have seen that work continue to 
evolve and improve since you joined in 2021.
    The Senate Sergeant at Arms helps each of our offices work 
effectively for the people that we serve, by improving the 
internal Senate communication, that you talked about, keeping 
our technology safe, and effective, and up to date, preparing 
for emergencies, and maintaining an open environment for 
constituents, and visitors, and a lot more.
    Chief Manger, I would like to thank you and all of the 
Capitol Police for the work you do to keep everyone who works 
here safe. Every day, and every hour members of our staff are 
here--members of your staff are here keeping an eye out for all 
of us who work here in the Nation's Capitol, and everyone who 
comes to visit.
    I am incredibly grateful to you, and all the Capitol Police 
Officers, for working so hard, for putting in late hours, like 
you just talked about, for sacrificing weekends, and a lot 
more, to keep everyone safe. And I know it has certainly not 
been an easy few years. We owe a lot to both of your agencies, 
starting with making sure you have the resources to do your 
jobs.
    So I am really glad to have this opportunity to hear more 
today about your agency's needs for the year ahead.
    Sergeant at Arms Gibson, let me start with you. You know, 
across the country our workers are facing some very real 
barriers to obtaining and retaining employment, including 
livable wages, and quality, affordable child care, critical 
mental health supports, wellness programs, resources for 
education and training, and that challenge, I know is reflected 
here in the Senate as well.
    We really rely on the men and women who work hard every day 
to support this institution. So we need to work to address 
those barriers. So I want to ask you today: What programs are 
most critical to supporting the SSA workforce? And what would 
they mean for your workforce if they were funded?
    General Gibson. So in terms of supporting the workforce, 
both my own, and those who work for our offices and committees, 
our most significant request in this budget is for the Employee 
Assistance Program. I am requesting two additional FTEs. Those 
are counselors that would support, and I should back up to talk 
about, briefly, the significant increase in utilization that we 
have had. 30 percent over 2021, in 2021----
    Senator Murray. 30 percent increase.
    General Gibson. 30 percent increase in utilization, 74 
percent of the Senate staff have accessed EAP services across 
90 percent of the Senate offices, for an increase, in 2022, of 
30 percent over what we saw in 2021. So hiring these two 
additional FTEs, in particular, will help with virtual after-
hour support for people working in State offices on the West 
Coast, for instance, or for people who are working later at 
night, or cannot come in during the day because of committee, 
or other work that they are doing.
    We are also requesting $307,000 to augment wellness 
resources, and some of that is for purchasing apps that are 
available much like it is done in the House; nutrition apps, 
consumers' checkbook, mindfulness apps. But it is also to 
expand dependent care resources, we would like to contract with 
Life-Care for back-up child care and tutoring services; this is 
a service that would help staff with locating, and assist with 
paying for, adult or child care when regular arrangements have 
fallen through, and that staff member must still come to work.
    The House already provides this support, we would be 
leveraging their contact--their contract to do this. But that 
is our most significant budget request in terms of taking care 
of our staff. Other things that we appreciate are the ability 
to fund Senate provided professional certification, whether 
that is licensing for our counselors, for some of our CPAs, 
project managers, that has been approved periodically by the 
Senate, it is in effect right now and we benefit from that 
tremendously.
    Senator Murray. Okay. Thank you. Those are really 
important. I appreciate that. And I want to ask you about the 
residential security program for senators' homes. How is the 
role out of that program going, and have had you any chance to 
review any of the lessons learned that we should know about?
    General Gibson. Certainly, so it is going well. We have a 
bit of enthusiasm for participation. As I mentioned, we have 
had 25 surveys so far this year, that- is 25 percent, 
obviously, of the Senate, a third of the year in, with another 
12 requests for services that are--or for assessments that are 
on the books, to have Capitol Police physical security experts 
go out and identify things that could be done at the homes. We 
look forward to being able to provide the first installations 
of some of that additional support later this summer.
    Some of our initial lessons learned, I think it has been 
largely positive. I have been able to participate in surveys 
here in the Washington, D.C., area, just to ensure I understood 
how they were conducted, and how that went. So in terms of 
identifying alarms, intrusion detection systems, a need for 
duress buttons, flood lights, deadbolts, lock work, et cetera, 
it has been very appreciated by those Senators and Senate 
spouses with whom we have worked so far.
    Senator Murray. Okay. Thank you very much.

                           RETENTION BONUSES

    Chief, I know that you and your team have been very focused 
on addressing the recommendations that resulted from the events 
of January 6, 2021, and are working to continue to enhance the 
capabilities to meet emerging mission requirements. Those are 
all costly initiatives, but I am glad that we have been working 
to provide you the resources that you need for that.
    But I also know that your workforce spends time away from 
their families, and makes a lot of personal sacrifice, you just 
mentioned that in your comments. I want to make sure we are 
focused on all their needs as well, while we fund those 
mission-critical items.
    Over the last couple of years, you have increased your 
sworn hiring and training to bolster your sworn workforce. Have 
you found the retention bonuses we were--where the fund have 
helped to curb attrition?
    Chief Manger. I think there is no question that that has 
helped. I mean, but in addition the--just changing the pay 
scale which was done last year, helped as well. And so we, I 
think it is--we had 2,037 employees accepted last year, we are 
getting ready to put it out again. And I expect a similar 
response. But the difference this year is, many of the officers 
that were hired right after 9/11 are now becoming eligible.
    And we have between 300 and 400 officers that are eligible 
to retire now. So I think it is very important for us to not 
only continue the retention bonuses but to, as I mentioned 
earlier, waive the mandatory retirement age up to 60, so 
hopefully that will keep some of the officers around for a 
couple extra years.
    Senator Murray. Okay. And have you been getting the support 
you need from the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center?
    Chief Manger. Absolutely. As you know, during the pandemic 
that was the choke point. They shut down for the better part of 
a year, and so we had--we were doing zero hiring, and we are 
still, actually, recovering from that, but they have given us 
all the assistance. In fact, we have multiple classes ongoing 
for most of the year.

           EMPLOYEE IN-HOUSE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM PARTICIPATION

    Senator Murray. Okay. And I am really glad that you were 
able to launch the Wellness Center for Members of the Capitol 
Police, obviously named after Officer Howard Liebengood. As I 
mentioned in the Emergency Security Supplemental Appropriations 
Act, and in the Omnibus, we were able to provide funding to 
continue to build on that effort. Are your employees using the 
In-House Employee Assistance Program?
    Chief Manger. Yes. There is always room for improvement. We 
are aware that oftentimes, folks that choose public safety for 
an occupation are hesitant to ask for help. And we are trying 
to overcome those barriers. But we have had, actually, a very 
good response. The Center is fully focused on outreach and 
awareness for all USCP employees sworn and civilian.
    So we can continue to track the utilization, and the 
service requests, and we have seen these numbers increasing as 
time has----
    Senator Murray. And real quickly, can you just tell us what 
your future plans for the Center are as you try to meet the 
needs of your employees?
    Chief Manger. You know, we always have to be an employee 
assistance organization, but I think what makes us unique is we 
have trauma-informed counselors, so that when we have folks 
that have gone through a crisis that we can provide services 
for them.
    But we are also making sure that we are listening to the 
users, listening to our workforce, and say, you know, what is 
it that you would like; whether it is, yoga, meditation, 
physical fitness, nutrition, coaching, peer support? We are 
asking our workforce what is it that you would like that we may 
not be offering yet?
    Senator Murray. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Senator Reed. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
    Senator Van Hollen, please.

                 HIRING TO CLOSE THE STAFFING SHORTAGE

    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And 
thank both of you for your leadership, and for the 
participation, and good work and service of all your teams, in 
making sure that our Capitol can be safe, and functioning well. 
And many of the folks who work for each of you are my 
constituents in Maryland, and it is always good to see them 
here every day, performing their duties for our democracy.
    Chief Manger, as you have said in your testimony, Capitol 
Police have been under tremendous pressure, we had COVID, we 
had January 6, and you saw, in the aftermath of those events, 
attrition. As you just mentioned, you are also facing the fact 
that a lot of folks who join the force after 9/11 are now 
eligible for retirement.
    I know you have spoken a little bit about how the budget 
you are requesting will address those issues, but can you 
specifically talk about the numbers of folks that you need to 
bring on in order to close the gap? And how confident are you 
that the measures you are asking for in this budget will allow 
you to reach your goals?
    Chief Manger. Well, first of all, I am very confident that 
if we are able to reach the levels for our salary, budget, to 
raise the number of people that we can hire, that that will go 
a long way to solving these attrition issues.
    I mean, there is one big reason that we are facing the 
attrition that we are facing; and that is that officers are 
being burnt out. When you have your days off cancelled, when 
you are at the end of your shift and your sergeant comes and 
tells you: Oh, by the way, you have got to work 6 or 8 more 
hours because we are short on the next shift. I mean, those are 
things that just, after a while, will demoralize your 
workforce. And this is, this happens much too often in our 
daily work days.
    So the only way that we are able to solve that is through 
increased staffing, both in our Uniformed Services, but what we 
are also finding, is in our Dignitary Protection. Those 
officers that are traveling with leadership, traveling with 
CODELs to provide protection all over the country, all over the 
world, that those were short there as well.
    And so that is why we asked for 64 additional DPD agents 
last year, and additional ones this year, so that we could get 
those staffing levels up to a point where those folks could see 
their families. This still remains one of the biggest 
challenges that we face with the Capitol Police, is trying to 
balance that work-life balance for our employees.

                 FALSE NARRATIVES SURROUNDING JANUARY 6

    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. In I think, February or 
early March of this year, Speaker McCarthy authorized the 
release of more than 40,000 hours of security footage from the 
awful events of January 6. He released them to former Fox News 
Host, Tucker Carlson, who then used them to create a false 
narrative surrounding the events of that day, concluding that 
the attack on the Capitol was, quote, ``Mostly peaceful 
chaos,'' unquote, and that, quote, ``The footage does not show 
an insurrection or riot in progress.''
    Chief Manger, Tucker Carlson is now no longer with Fox 
News, but a lot of the damage has been done. Can you talk about 
the impact this false narrative has had on the men and women 
who work for you?
    Chief Manger. The following day when he did that program, I 
put out a message to all of my employees, and I talked to them 
about what--the narrative that he tried to put forth, how 
disrespectful it was to the men and women of the Capitol 
Police. And I think what was fortunate, is that that narrative 
that Mr. Carlson tried to put out had no legs. I think most 
folks understood exactly what it was. And so I think that was 
very gratifying to the members of the Capitol Police, to see 
that the public did not agree with that assessment.
    I appreciate that. And I agree with you, that despite his 
best efforts, the American public understood exactly what 
happened on that day, and that it was not the narrative that he 
put out.
    Ms. Gibson, thank you and your team as well, for all that 
you do. Obviously, one of the critical functions that you have, 
together with the Chief and the Chief's team, is security here 
at the Capitol. And we want to make sure we provide that 
security. We also, of course, want to make sure that the 
Capitol remains open as much as possible to the public, so that 
lawmakers are accessible to the people they represent.
    Senator Blunt and I had previously introduced--
formerSenator Blunt and I, had previously introduced 
legislation to make sure we did not have a permanent wall, and 
I know that no one is proposing one. You have outlined some of 
the--you plans, I think, to develop some criteria.
    General Gibson. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Van Hollen. For when you would put up temporary 
fencing, under emergency situations, which is certainly 
understandable and justifiable. Could you talk a little bit 
about the time line for all of that?
    General Gibson. Thank you, Senator. We are working 
collaboratively, across the Capitol Police Board, to establish 
some general guidelines, not requirements, for how we would 
make decisions regarding the implementation of security 
measures like that, based on the imminence of a threat, the 
credibility of a threat, the size of the threat, the ability of 
the Capitol Police to respond to a potential threat.
    As well as, if we did not have a fence for instance, what 
other resources would we apply, and what would the cost of that 
be. And I think that we have demonstrated--in the past the 
Board has demonstrated wise use, constrained use of the fence 
for select events such as the State of the Union Address, and 
has not seen a need to erect the fence for other kinds of 
events.
    So even though we have not yet finalized what that kind of 
framework and guidance would look like, I think we have 
operated well, in terms of making those decisions in the past.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Thank you both. Appreciate 
it.
    Senator Reed. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.
    I just have a few questions. General Gibson, you are the 
Chair of the Capitol Police Board, which is an inherently 
difficult job, not many police departments are led by 
committees, so you have got your work cut out for you. But in 
the wake of January 6 there was, I think, some justifiable 
criticism of the Board's actions, and the Board's abilities. 
Can you please tell us what you have done, together with your 
colleagues, to improve the Operational Board, and the 
supervision of the Capitol Police?
    General Gibson. Certainly. Thank you, Senator. I appreciate 
that question. I would start by thanking Congress for the 
statutory change in 2021 that allows the Chief to call on 
resources in an emergency without convening the Board to do so, 
and I think that was an important change that has certainly 
made the security response far more agile.
    The role of the Capitol Police Board is to hire and 
supervise the Chief of Police, and to provide oversight of and 
support to the Capitol Police in the execution of their 
mission, while serving as a touch point between the Police and 
Congress.
    And I think we have done this, you know, through our 
regulating of policing on the Campus, traffic regulations, 
reviewing and approving the overall security measures, and 
establishing broad policy guidelines to manage the Department.
    Our decisions do, generally, require consensus, and a 
consensus that is acceptable to all, which is especially 
important in this bicameral, bipartisan environment, to arrive 
at security decisions that provide for the security of the 
entire campus, and the people who come here, while facilitating 
operations.
    I think an example of one that we would--that I could point 
to where we, as a Board, have worked collaboratively to develop 
a solution would be, the Department's hiring of contract 
security officers. As the Chief, you know, examines the 
security shortage, and the personnel shortage, and identified 
some, potentially, short-term and long-term solutions to that.
    One that was proposed was to deploy contract security 
officers at select secondary locations within the building, 
say, as people are getting on or off of the subway. They have 
already been through screening and magnetometers; perhaps it 
doesn't have to be a sworn officer there. And we work together 
with the Department to develop a proposal that would both meet 
the Department's needs, was respectful of the feedback that we 
received from our key stakeholders, and was performed with an 
understanding of the budgetary implications.
    And so this is, I think, an example of a way in which the 
Capitol Police Board can work collaboratively, outside of 
emergency situations, to develop a solution.
    As I noted in my oral statement, I am especially proud that 
the GAO has determined that a finding from 2017 that had been 
previously unresolved that said that we were not following good 
governance measures that they have said, based on our update of 
the manual of procedures, and are following our manual of 
procedures for the last 18 months, that they now find us to be 
in good standing with the best practices of governance, of 
oversight boards like this.
    And I think that is also a testament to the progress that 
my fellow Board Members and I have made.

                 MUTUAL AID AND COLLABORATIVE POLICING

    Senator Reed. Thank you. And just finally, Chief; the 
General pointed out that you have the authority in a situation 
to call upon additional support, if necessary, which raises the 
issue of mutual aid, practical, coordination, on a constant 
basis, with other departments, both the Metropolitan, and 
Washington, D.C. Police, surrounding Community Police, Federal 
agencies. Can you just come at about how we are doing in that 
regard?
    Chief Manger. We are doing very well. And I can say that 
with great confidence, because we have utilized those 
agreements that we have put into place many times, whether it 
is just getting a couple of police departments to send us a 
civil disturbance unit component for a large event that we 
might be having, or getting, you know, eight to ten different 
agencies here to provide us with the assistance.
    So it is something that not only have we put into place, we 
have dozens of MOUs with agencies in and around the D.C. area, 
but we have put it into practice enough times that it is pretty 
seamless.
    Senator Reed. Thank you very much. I want to thank both of 
you for your dedication and your service. And I particularly 
want to thank all of your uniformed and non-uniformed personnel 
who do so much each day.
    And as one of my colleagues said, as we come in the morning 
we are greeted, and we feel, I think, a little bit more secure 
as well as a little happier when we see the Capitol Police, and 
your personnel, General Gibson. Thank you.
