    Chairman Steil. I will note I believe the first document 
was produced in the personal office of Ms. Lofgren, not from 
the Committee, if that is accurate.
    I appreciate all of our witnesses being here today. I think 
we are having a really good conversation about how we make it 
easy to vote, hard to cheat, about how we protect individuals' 
First Amendment rights. And I think it is really important that 
we are holding this hearing on the 10th anniversary or near the 
10th anniversary, almost to the day, of the Lois Lerner 
debacle.
    We need to make sure we are protecting the freedom of 
speech here in the United States of America. I think the ACE 
Act moves us forward in that direction.
    I appreciate everyone's time today.
    Members of the Committee may have some additional questions 
for you, and we ask that you please respond to those questions 
in writing.
    And pursuant to paragraph c of Rule 14 of the Rules of the 
Committee, I hereby appoint Caleb Hays, a member of my staff, 
as parliamentarian of the Committee.
    I seek unanimous consent that the letter be entered into 
the official record. A copy of the letter was made available to 
all Committee Members.
    [The letter follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Chairman Steil. Without objection, each Member will have 5 
legislative days to insert additional materials into the record 
or to revise and extend their remarks.
    If there is no further business, I thank the Members for 
their participation.
    Without objection, the Committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:20 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
