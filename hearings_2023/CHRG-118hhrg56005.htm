  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF DUNCAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
           CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

    I want to thank you all for being here today to examine the 
Department of Energy's fiscal year 2024 budget request. Today 
marks the first time that Secretary Granholm has appeared 
before this subcommittee in over a year.
    Madam Secretary, welcome back to the subcommittee.
    The administration's budget request for fiscal year 2024 is 
almost $52 billion, a $6.2 billion or 13.6 percent increase 
from enacted levels in 2023. This includes a $366 million 
increase for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
Energy, a $46 million increase for cybersecurity, a $238 
million cut to nuclear energy.
    This request is in addition to the billions of dollars 
already appropriated to DOE through the Democrats' tax-and-
spend bill, the infrastructure bill, and the CHIPS Act, all of 
which passed in the last Congress. I look forward to taking a 
closer look at the request and DOE's priorities today.
    Energy is the foundational--is foundational, and impacts 
every aspect of American life. Democrats' rush-to-green 
policies are making energy unaffordable for too many Americans. 
Over the past 2 years, energy prices have skyrocketed. This 
administration has discouraged private-sector investment in 
critical energy infrastructure like oil and gas pipelines, 
issued onerous regulations on energy production and processing 
facilities, maintained a needlessly complex bureaucracy that 
makes permitting reliable power generation like nuclear energy 
nearly impossible, and made our energy supply chains more 
vulnerable to hostile foreign actors.
    Not long ago, America was an energy superpower. Increased 
American energy production helped strengthen our economy and 
gave our industries a competitive advantage, allowed us to 
challenge adversarial energy dictators without having to worry 
about global markets, all while decreasing greenhouse gas 
emissions. President Biden and his Department of Energy has 
spent the past 2 years ceding that strength and autonomy to 
hostile nations like China, Russia, and Venezuela.
    Since the beginning of 2021, retail electricity rates have 
increased by 8 percent, gas prices have increased roughly 46 
percent, natural gas prices are up roughly 31 percent, and home 
heating oil and diesel fuel are up by 49 percent. 
Unfortunately, Democrats and President Biden's regressive 
energy agenda takes a whole-of-government approach to phase out 
American energy production and ship it overseas to countries 
like China.
    In fact, the Department recently announced its intention to 
award $200 million to a Chinese battery company, Microvast. We 
have yet to hear a good explanation from the Department 
regarding how this company was able to secure taxpayer dollars 
intended to establish a domestic supply chain for battery 
technologies.
    If we follow President Biden's energy agenda, Americans 
will become even more dependent upon China and Russia. The 
critical minerals supply chain for renewable energy 
technologies is largely controlled by those two countries. This 
rush-to-green agenda includes an impractical goal of a zero-
carbon electric grid by 2035. And with this impractical goal 
comes calls for a massive expansion of transmission 
infrastructure.
    The driving force behind this push to build transmission is 
not reliability or to lower costs for consumers; it is largely 
to connect more renewable energy to the grid. I am not totally 
averse to that. That is why I am wary of a lot of the so-called 
reforms to the transmission permitting process as well as a lot 
of the transmission programs in DOE's budget request. Most are 
a precursor to achieve this unrealistic rush-to-green goal.
    President Biden's energy agenda discourages investment in 
traditional energy sources that provide 24/7 electricity 
generation. According to the EIA, last year we added the least 
amount of interstate natural gas pipeline capacity since the 
agency began collecting data nearly 30 years ago. This did not 
happen by accident.
    Republicans on Energy and Commerce have solutions to 
reverse the Democrats' regressive energy agenda. H.R. 1, the 
Lower Energy Costs Act, passed the House a few weeks ago with a 
bipartisan vote. Legislation would create a regulatory 
structure that encourages investment and innovation to bring 
all forms of energy online.
    The Department of Energy's core mission is to confront 
energy security needs that face our Nation. This budget request 
falls short of that goal. Instead, the Biden administration's 
Energy Department prioritizes Green New Deal policies that 
raise prices for hardworking Americans and embolden foreign 
adversaries.
    When America is a world leader in energy production, the 
world is safer and a cleaner place. President Biden's Energy 
Department has put its foot on the scale in favor of green 
technologies at the expense of reliable fuels like nuclear, 
natural gas, and hydropower. This is making our supply chains 
more vulnerable to foreign adversaries, dragging down economic 
growth, harming our national security, and raising prices for 
everyday American families. DOE must reverse these policies and 
return to its core energy security mission.
    So I want to thank you again, Chair Rodgers, for letting me 
hold this hearing. I want to thank the Secretary for being 
here, and I look forward to her testimony.

    Mr. Duncan. And I now recognize Ranking Member DeGette for 
5 minutes.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANA DeGETTE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO

    Ms. DeGette. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.
    And Secretary Granholm, thank you so much for joining us 
today. It is good to see you. I want to commend you and your 
agency for the critical work that you have been doing in recent 
years to help us combat the climate crisis and to ensure that 
Americans continue to have access to the energy that they need 
as we transition to more renewable forms of electricity.
    As I have said countless times before while sitting here at 
this dais, the climate change is an existential threat to the 
future of this planet, and we must address it immediately, if 
not past immediately. We know the only way to meaningfully 
address this crisis is by significantly cutting our greenhouse 
gas emissions, and as quickly as possible. We know that to do 
that we have to transition to clean sources of energy now.
    Breaking our reliance on fossil fuels will not only help us 
stave off the worst effects of the climate crisis, but it will 
also protect consumers around the country from the sudden 
increases in the cost of gasoline that can strain families' 
budgets. And it will help us ensure that all Americans have 
access to the affordable, reliable energy that they need. And 
good news, looking at your budget, I believe the Department of 
Energy's proposed budget for next year will continue to help 
put us on a path to do exactly that.
    By increasing funding for key research projects and 
initiatives and continuing to focus on industrial 
decarbonization, supply chain development, and workforce 
transition, the Department is helping us create a cleaner, more 
diverse energy portfolio right here in the United States. The 
agency's plans to invest $9.4 billion for energy programs and 
$8.8 billion for the Office of Science will help the research, 
development, and demonstration of clean energy technologies and 
support the important work that is being done by our national 
laboratories.
    While there is no doubt we still have a long way to go in 
making this clean energy transition, the investments that will 
be made under this proposal will provide critical support to 
this incredibly important endeavor.
    It will provide $1.2 billion for industrial decarbonization 
efforts, including $160 million for the Office of Clean Energy 
Demonstrations to support large-scale industrial 
decarbonization projects.
    It includes $75 million to launch the Global Clean Energy 
Manufacturing Initiative, which will help build resilient 
supply chains for the clean energy future, a critical component 
of this fight.
    And it includes $2 billion to support the clean energy 
workforce and to help fund key infrastructure projects across 
the Nation, including millions of dollars to help weatherize 
low-income communities and retrofit their homes to lower energy 
costs for communities that have been forced to 
disproportionately bear the brunt of the climate crisis for far 
too long.
    Each and every one of these proposals will play a critical 
role in helping us combat the climate crisis. They will also 
help us not only stabilize the cost of energy here at home but 
lower it for many Americans by making critical new investments 
to increase our energy efficiency and drive the innovation of 
new clean energy technologies.
    This budget also makes commonsense investments in cyber and 
energy system security, as well as environmental health and 
management for low-income communities.
    It includes $156.6 million for the Energy Information 
Agency, whose work provides critical energy information and 
data that informs our work.
    It includes $56.6 million for the Office of Technology 
Transmission to help accelerate the commercialization of new 
clean energy technologies.
    And it includes $165.2 million for the DOE Office of the 
Inspector General to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being 
used efficiently and effectively.
    I believe that this budget will allow the DOE to place the 
United States where it belongs, as the leader in the clean 
energy transition. And I want to thank you, Senator--sorry, not 
Senator, didn't mean to give you a demotion--Secretary 
Granholm, again, for being with us today, and for explaining 
how this is going to happen.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. DeGette follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Ms. DeGette. And I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentlelady. And now it is my honor 
to recognize the gentlelady who is the Chair of the full 
committee, Chair Rodgers, for 5 minutes for her opening 
statement.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS, A 
    REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Secretary Granholm, welcome. Foundational to our lives and 
our future is access to affordable, reliable, and clean energy. 
On Energy and Commerce, we have worked since the start of this 
Congress to achieve that promise, most recently by passing H.R. 
1, the Lower Energy Costs Act. Today I am deeply troubled that 
the Department of Energy under your leadership has put America 
on a dangerous path that harms our energy security and benefits 
our adversaries, mainly China.
    Since day one, Department of Energy has enabled the 
President to shut down American energy. Rather than sounding 
the alarm about America's declining energy security, the 
administration canceled the Keystone pipeline; begged OPEC, 
Russia, and Venezuela to produce more oil and gas; supported 
the completion of Russia's Nord Stream pipeline; and turned to 
China for solar panels and batteries made with slave labor and 
dirty manufacturing.
    As a result, America's energy prices are higher than ever, 
and we are less energy secure. Gas and electricity prices 
remain too high. Our electric grid is becoming unstable, and 
this is driving inflation and hurting Americans and businesses. 
Because of this, families every day have to make tough choices 
about whether to put gas in the car or food on the table.
    Earlier this year we heard from a local Virginia farmer, 
David Hickman, a fifth-generation farm owner whose livelihood 
has been made worse by these policies. And he told us, and I 
quote, ``This is the most perilous time for American 
agriculture.''
    In some places like California, the government is even 
asking people to ration energy. This should be a warning to the 
Biden administration.
    One of the first orders of business this Congress was the 
passage of bipartisan bills to stop President Biden and the 
Department of Energy from mismanaging the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve and sending our emergency stockpile to China. Now our 
SPR is at the lowest level in 40 years. I am equally concerned 
that this administration is making us more dependent upon 
China.
    America has the highest labor and environmental standards 
in the world. We value liberty and equality. Madam Secretary, 
you support waivers for solar panels sourced from China, even 
when China violates our trade laws, uses slave labor, and 
pollutes more than any other nation.
    The Department of Energy is spending hundreds of billions 
of dollars of taxpayer dollars to force an energy transition on 
Americans with a false promise of 100 percent wind, solar, and 
battery-powered energy, the supply chains for which are 
basically controlled by adversarial China. And at the same 
time, the administration is threatening to ban natural gas 
stoves and other home appliances that Americans rely on.
    We have seen the future that these proposed policies and 
government mandates lead to. I have recently visited Europe 
with other Energy and Commerce Committee members, and it was 
clear that Europe's rush to green destroyed their energy and 
manufacturing industries and increased their reliance on 
adversaries like Russia and China. And now Europe is in an 
energy crisis following Russia's war with Ukraine. We cannot 
let Europe's mistakes become America's future.
    DOE must return to its core mission, its mission to protect 
America's energy security and our way of life, which brings us 
to the budget request for fiscal year 2024. Last year DOE 
received a 200 percent boost in funding, nearly $100 billion 
and up to 350 billion in new loan authorities, and that is an 
additional--to its regular appropriations of 46 billion. This 
year the request is to increase the budget to 52 billion.
    Our constitutional responsibility is to ensure that the 
Department of Energy carries out its mission, and the mission 
is for two of our Nation's most critical missions: that is 
maintaining our nuclear weapons and ensuring America's energy 
security. Rather than being focused on this core mission, we 
see the Department prioritizing the implementation of a rush-
to-green agenda and rushing to spend money without taking the 
steps to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.
    The actions taken by Department of Energy and the alarming 
comments that you have made, Madam Secretary, about commending 
China and suggesting that the U.S. follow the Chinese Communist 
Party's lead have failed to reassure me that DOE's priorities 
are aligned with the needs of Americans or the national and 
energy security interests of the United States.
    We must abandon this dangerous and radical agenda so that 
people, Americans, have the opportunity for a better life and a 
secure future.
    [The prepared statement of Mrs. Rodgers follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady yields back. I will now 
recognize the ranking member of the full committee, the 
gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Pallone, for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, Jr., A REPRESENTATIVE 
            IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And after hearing from our committee's Republican 
leadership, I have to say that I support strongly President 
Biden's energy agenda, which I know is your energy agenda. 
Frankly, I don't think we would be able to compete in a global 
economy if we don't--and certainly not compete with China--if 
we don't move forward with the President's energy agenda.
    And I want to also say that I think that H.R. 1 would 
destroy our economy and certainly reverse the remarkable and 
robust job creation that we have seen under President Biden. So 
in my opinion, you are doing everything that is necessary to 
compete with China and recognize fully well the competition 
that we face with China.
    I wanted to say, with the passage of the Inflation 
Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we have 
certainly given the Department of Energy a lot of work to do. 
And I am looking forward to getting updates on some of these 
important clean energy programs today.
    Let me start with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which 
invests $1.2 trillion to modernize our Nation's aging and 
crumbling infrastructure. The law includes important funding 
for DOE to invest in American manufacturing, increase access to 
energy efficiency, and make our Nation's electric grid more 
clean and secure.
    Now, that was the first step, and then we followed it up by 
passing the Inflation Reduction Act. That law provides $369 
billion to build more clean energy in America, create clean 
energy jobs, lower energy costs for American families, and 
slash greenhouse gas pollution.
    And DOE is also playing a major role in implementing these 
funds that are supporting innovative clean energy projects, 
that are investing in communities all around the Nation and 
have helped create 142,000 good-paying, clean energy jobs since 
the law was enacted in August. They are also providing rebates 
to consumers for more efficient home appliances to lower energy 
costs for hardworking American families. And DOE is addressing 
emissions at America's industrial facilities, as well.
    Now, these two laws, the infrastructure bill and the 
Inflation Reduction Act, are making a real difference in 
communities all around the Nation, including in Republican 
congressional districts. But as we know, not one Republican on 
this committee supported either of these bills. And that was 
bad enough, but now they are trying to hold our economy hostage 
by threatening a default crisis if we don't go along with their 
demands to roll back these crucial investments and to put 
polluters over people.
    Last month, House Republicans passed the Default on America 
Act that does the bidding of Big Oil and Gas, increases energy 
costs for working families, and sets American workers up to be 
left behind by abandoning our homegrown clean energy industry. 
The Republican bill will cut important programs that provide 
rebates to consumers for home appliances and remove funding for 
workforce programs in these new and developing industries. It 
also repeals key energy programs from the Inflation Reduction 
Act, repeals the zero-emission nuclear power tax credit that 
was praised by our witness at a recent hearing on nuclear 
issues, and raises taxes on American energy.
    Committee Republicans have not only been trying to 
undermine these new laws, but they have attempted to 
manufacture scandals that simply do not exist. Last month they 
even sent a letter to you, Madam Secretary, criticizing you for 
your ``international travel to Puerto Rico.'' Of course, Puerto 
Ricans have been U.S. citizens for over 100 years, and with all 
the energy issues there, we should be commending the Secretary 
for visiting Puerto Rico and prioritizing their issues.
    At the end of the day, Republican energy policies look to 
the past, while Democrats and the Biden administration are 
looking to the future with our commitment to the clean energy 
transition. The President's DOE budget request includes 
important funding that will help us meet our decarbonization 
goals and build on the success of both the Inflation Reduction 
Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
    So I also want to highlight the good work that the 
Department is doing outside of these laws. Last year, DOE 
periodically released crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve to help lower gasoline prices at the pump for Americans 
following Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Today the price of a 
barrel of crude is $34 cheaper than it was a year ago. The 
price of a gallon of gasoline is nearly 80 cents cheaper than 
it was a year ago. So, Secretary, thank you for the 
Department's decisive action in this regard, and thank you 
again for joining us today.

    Mr. Pallone. And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman.
    So our witness today is the Honorable Jennifer Granholm, 
Secretary of the Department of Energy, who I understand drove 
her electric vehicle up to the Hill to testify today, this 
year.
    So you are recognized for 5 minutes, Madam Secretary.

  STATEMENT OF JENNIFER M. GRANHOLM, SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF 
                             ENERGY

    Ms. Granholm. Great, thank you so much, Chair Duncan and 
Ranking Member DeGette, and members of the subcommittee. I am 
so honored to be with you today to discuss the President's 
latest budget request for the Department of Energy.
    Over the last 2 years it has been my great privilege to 
lead the Department in meeting many of our Nation's most 
pressing needs. From deepening our energy security by reshoring 
supply chains and manufacturing to strengthening American 
innovation with cutting-edge research and development to 
maintaining a strong nuclear deterrent, we are positioning the 
United States to outmaneuver aggressors, outcompete our rivals, 
and create new jobs and opportunities for the American people.
    The President's budget request for fiscal year 2024 will 
empower us to drive these endeavors forward, even in the face 
of emerging challenges. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has 
sparked a reckoning with our overreliance on fossil fuels. 
Vladimir Putin has exploited this overreliance, injecting 
extreme volatility into global markets and leaving working 
people in the United States bearing higher energy costs.
    In response, we are pursuing a strategy of energy security 
through energy diversity. Congress has made the United States 
the world's most attractive destination for investment in new 
energy, and the Department is helping the country capitalize 
using the resources that you have provided.
    Through the infrastructure law, the Inflation Reduction 
Act, and regular appropriations, we are backing large-scale 
deployment of solar, wind, electric vehicles, and storage. We 
are funding demonstrations of next-generation technologies, 
clean hydrogen, advanced nuclear, carbon capture. We are 
building a more resilient, reliable grid that can integrate 
this increasing number of solutions while better weathering 
disruptions, and we are shoring up supply chains so that no 
adversaries will be able to threaten our access to energy. This 
is all to the great benefit of American companies, American 
communities, and American workers.
    In the last 2 years, for example, planned investments in 
America's battery, solar, and wind supply chains have reached 
more than $100 billion. Those investments will support 
thousands of jobs, especially manufacturing technologies that 
are stamped ``Made in the USA.''
    Still, we know that the more we can improve performance and 
reduce costs, the faster we can deploy these technologies, the 
faster the bills for Americans will be lower, and that is why 
the budget boosts our clean energy research, development, and 
demonstration programs.
    A couple of highlights: Our Office of Fossil Energy and 
Carbon Management is advancing a suite of CCUS technologies as 
well as technologies to recover critical minerals from carbon 
sources; our Office of Science would receive more than $1 
billion for fusion research, furthering our work to harness 
fusion's tremendous potential; and our Office of Nuclear Energy 
is driving innovation in nuclear fusion and keeping our 
domestic fleet online so we can make the most of this clean, 
reliable baseload power.
    Programs like the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program 
and the Civil Nuclear Credit Program are helping us to cut 
carbon pollution and boost grid reliability. And through our 
consent-based siting process, we are getting closer to 
identifying sites for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel.
    Furthermore, the budget provides more than $8 billion for 
our Office of Environmental Management to treat radioactive 
tank waste, to address contamination issues across EM sites, 
and to enhance river protection, particularly at the Hanford 
site.
    I would note that the request aligns with an announcement 
that we made last week, which is we have reached a conceptual 
agreement with the EPA and Washington State's Department of 
Ecology for managing millions of gallons of tank waste at the 
Hanford site in a safe, effective, and achievable manner, and 
that achievement would not have been possible without 
bipartisan support from Congress.
    Your support is indispensable to all of our core missions, 
and we will need it for the work ahead. The President's budget 
will allow us to shore up our energy security and our national 
security while reinforcing our efforts to properly implement 
Congress's legislative actions.
    Thank you so much for the opportunity to address you today, 
and I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Granholm follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady yields back, and so now I will 
begin the questioning portion of the hearing.
    Before we do, I would like to enter into the record an 
article here about the need for domestically sourced enriched 
uranium, and get away from Russia.
    So without objection, so ordered.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr. Duncan. So electricity prices in the Nation are 52 
percent higher over the last 2 years than they were for the 
last 4 years, or the only 4 years under the last 
administration. And for the record I will reiterate that you 
have increased the budget for the Office of Energy Efficiency 
and Renewable Energy by 366 million while also cutting 238 
million to nuclear energy.
    We will get back to nuclear in a minute, but I wonder--why 
cut nuclear power investments by that amount?
    The PJM Interconnection, the Nation's largest grid 
operator, issued a dire warning earlier this year regarding the 
premature retirement of dispatchable generation. This report 
noted that, at the current pace of retirements, the grid 
operator will potentially face a significant generation 
capacity shortfall by 2030. PJM noted numerous policies 
directly impacting these premature generation retirements, 
including multiple EPA regulations--and we just saw another one 
today; State rush-to-green policies; and private-sector ESG 
commitments. Massive tax credits and subsidies are unreliable. 
Wind and solar are contributing to this problem, as well.
    These are all issues that policymakers, the Biden 
administration, and congressional Democrats specifically are 
forcing onto the American people, decreasing grid reliability 
and raising consumer costs. It seems the Biden administration's 
energy policy is a pay more, get less.
    So I know the DOE signed a memorandum of understanding with 
the EPA regarding coordination on electric reliability, but the 
agreement seems to do nothing in practice. What specific 
actions is your Department taking to improve grid reliability?
    Ms. Granholm. Several things, thank you. One is we are 
making sure that we have enough transmission to ensure that the 
grid is able to take on the additional resources that we want 
to see continue to be deployed, including clean--but clean 
energy that includes nuclear, that includes hydroelectric, that 
includes geothermal, that includes solar, that includes wind, 
and that includes battery storage.
    Mr. Duncan. How about some specifics? Those are all general 
topics, and we could agree with that. But how about some 
specifics that you are doing?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, specifically, we are accelerating the 
implementation and deployment of the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law, which helps to increase grid reliability. So, for example, 
we have just announced a series of funding opportunities called 
the GRIP Program, which will enhance the reliability of the 
grid by giving grid operators the opportunity to make sure that 
they also enhance security by potentially undergrounding, by 
adding additional transmission.
    So the tools that have been given to the Department related 
to grid reliability are very important to be able to ensure 
that we have enough access to reliable power and that the 
transmission grid is able to withstand it.
    Mr. Duncan. So we are going to need transmission line 
permitting reform. We also need gas pipeline permitting 
reform--the statement I referenced concerning lack of natural 
gas pipeline capacity and its effects on energy reliability, 
especially dispatchable energy. This committee adopted reforms 
to the interstate natural gas pipeline permitting process, 
which ultimately passed the House bipartisanly.
    The reliability of our electricity system is closed 
interconnected with the interstate natural gas--closely 
interconnected with the interstate natural gas pipeline system. 
We need to build more to improve electric reliability.
    Do you believe insufficient natural gas pipeline capacity 
harms grid reliability and affordability for consumers?
    Ms. Granholm. I think we have to have sufficient 
infrastructure to make sure that we have the dispatchable 
power----
    Mr. Duncan. Infrastructure means----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. That we need.
    Mr. Duncan [continuing]. Expansion of pipelines, more 
pipelines, and----
    Ms. Granholm. We are going to need pipelines, certainly, 
for making sure that dispatchable power gets to the places 
where it is needed.
    Mr. Duncan. Where it needs to be to be utilized----
    Ms. Granholm. But we also need----
    Mr. Duncan [continuing]. By the utilities, correct?
    Ms. Granholm. We also need to be able to have pipelines for 
hydrogen, for----
    Mr. Duncan. Carbon capture.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. For carbon capture, et cetera. 
So----
    Mr. Duncan. Export, you could throw that in there to help 
the world.
    Ms. Granholm. And I would say that your observation about 
permitting reform is right on. We need to do permitting reform 
across the board, and I am hopeful that this----
    Mr. Duncan. I look forward to working with you on that.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Congress will be able to get 
there.
    Mr. Duncan. So I want to talk on nuclear real quick. I 
recently chaired a subcommittee on nuclear hearing--on nuclear 
energy, and it was bipartisan. I was pleased by that. There was 
widespread agreement, and there is widespread agreement, both 
chambers and both sides of the aisle.
    It has been over 2 years, and the DOE still hasn't complied 
with the congressional directions to stand up and advance 
nuclear fuel or HALEU, program. Is that reflective of DOE or 
administrative policies? And why do we have this delay?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, we need to do a whole project with 
respect to HALEU and uranium, overall, to make sure that we can 
fuel our current fleet as well as the advanced reactors. We do 
not want to be reliant on Russia.
    We have stood up a uranium--started to set up a uranium 
reserve. We have asked for and we are--we will be issuing a 
funding opportunity announcement for uranium----
    Mr. Duncan. My time is expiring. Let me just ask you this: 
Why cut nuclear energy funding by $238 million?
    Ms. Granholm. Because that funding was--had been used to 
fund the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, and that is 
now funded over at the--through the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law. And so it would have been duplicative. So it is something 
that the Department--that the Office of Nuclear Energy actually 
supported because we didn't need that funding at this moment.
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you for that.
    My time has expired. I will now go to the ranking member, 
Ms. DeGette, for 5 minutes.
    Ms. DeGette. Thank you so much.
    Madam Secretary, as I mentioned in my opening statement, 
the climate crisis is an existential threat that has to be 
addressed as quickly as possible. And you know quite well, 
because you are on the front line, we have to slash our 
greenhouse gas emissions and transition to clean energy and 
provide energy at an affordable rate to Americans.
    So I have a couple questions. I assume you agree with me 
that, to combat the worst impacts of climate change, we have to 
drastically reduce our emissions. Is that right?
    Ms. Granholm. I do.
    Ms. DeGette. And one way to do that is to rapidly deploy 
zero-carbon-emitting sources of wind and solar and other 
sources. Is that right?
    Ms. Granholm. Correct.
    Ms. DeGette. But now--I mean, let's cut to the chase. The 
last 10 percent of emission reductions will be the hardest. And 
we don't yet have the technology to be able to say we can get 
to 100 percent by 2050. So how is the agency positioning itself 
and its work to actually be able to close that gap and to meet 
the goals we need to make?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, thank you for that question. I mean, 
both on the research and development side, through our work at 
the labs and our work in the Department, as well as on the 
deployment side, we will be doing both on the difficult-to-
decarbonize areas, such as industrial decarbonization, heavy 
transportation, aviation, et cetera.
    Part of the--and thank you for supporting the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. Those tools 
will allow for us--and we have just--we have got a funding 
opportunity announcement out for industrial decarbonization, 
but it is also the--and the budget actually supports an 
increased amount for our office of decarbonizing industry. But 
we also are seeing that, with hydrogen and the hydrogen hubs, 
that is a tool that can be used to decarbonize heavy industry, 
cement, et cetera, steel. That tool is important.
    And decarbonizing heavy transportation. Our vehicle 
technologies office and the work that we have done on both 
electrification as well as fuel cells for transportation, also 
very, very important. And then I would say carbon capture and 
sequestration is another tool to be able to help to decarbonize 
heavy industry, all of which we are working on, both on the 
research side as well as on the deployment side.
    Ms. DeGette. That is great. One of the things that we talk 
a lot about in this committee--and it is a very real concern--
is what are we going to do about the fossil fuel workforce?
    I represent Colorado, which is traditionally an oil and gas 
State. But I think that, as we try to move towards a clean 
energy economy, we have to transition the workforce. So can you 
talk to me about what is happening, both the investments in the 
last Congress and also in this budget, to help continuity for 
the existing energy workforce?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, there are several things that are 
happening.
    One is that there is an all-of-government approach to being 
able to focus on the skill sets that will be needed for next-
generation technologies and making sure we are able to upskill 
the workers, particularly in fossil communities, but also in 
communities that have high unemployment.
    What we want to do is create sector-specific skill sets and 
make sure that those are taken in a place-based manner. When 
grants are awarded, for example, to hydrogen hubs, we need 
workers to be able to both build as well as to operate 
facilities. The fossil fuel workforce, for example, those who 
do natural gas, who extract natural gas, who extract oil from 
beneath the subsurface, have an expertise in subsurface fuels. 
They can also be transitioned to geothermal, for example. Those 
who build offshore wind platforms can also be building 
offshore--who build offshore oil and gas platforms can build 
offshore wind platforms. Those skills matches are part of what 
the Department is working on through our workforce development 
initiatives, as well as through the skills--the tools that the 
Congress has given us on--through the Inflation Reduction Act 
on apprenticeships, et cetera, funding and incentivizing those 
apprenticeships.
    Ms. DeGette. Thank you. I have one last question, because 
we have had a lot of hearings and markups in this committee 
already this year, for which I commend the chairman, because we 
have to work on energy. But one thing that folks on the other 
side of the aisle keep pounding on, we can't do this just 
through--they keep somehow insinuating the administration is 
trying to move to zero-carbon emissions program just through 
solar and wind.
    And I want to be clear. Has the administration said we are 
not going to have nuclear, or hydro power, or other types of 
things--of energy sources?
    Ms. Granholm. On the contrary, the administration is very 
much in favor of nuclear, hydroelectric power, geothermal 
power. We want to grow the energy pie by adding diverse forms 
of sources--of clean energy sources, and to decarbonize the 
existing fossil fuel sources. We want to do both.
    Ms. DeGette. Thank you.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady yields back. I will now go to 
the Chair of the full committee, Mrs. Rodgers, for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And again, Madam Secretary, I appreciate you being here.
    The war in Russia really exposed our energy security 
vulnerabilities and the danger of relying on adversaries for 
our energy needs, and I have had numerous conversations with 
our European allies, you know, and they regret some of the 
decisions that were made that led them to this place to be 
dependent, dangerously dependent, on Russian natural gas. And 
they have been pleading with us for years for America to 
increase our LNG exports.
    Now, in America we are blessed with some of the world's 
largest and cleanest supplies of fossil fuels, the critical 
minerals for renewables, plentiful supplies for uranium to 
power our nuclear reactors. And--but unfortunately, we are 
falling behind on the processing of those minerals and uranium. 
China controls more than 90 percent of the critical minerals 
processing used for renewables and batteries. And the U.S. 
nuclear fleet imports more than 20 percent of its enriched 
uranium from Russia. Reliance on Russian-sourced nuclear fuel 
has weakened our nuclear fuel infrastructure and now puts our 
whole nuclear security at risk.
    Congress imposed a ban on Russian oil and gas imports. Do 
you support a ban on importing Russian enriched uranium into 
the U.S., as well?
    Ms. Granholm. I would certainly consider that if we have 
our own--developed our own supply. We want to be energy 
independent, we don't want to harm----
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK. OK, thank you.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Existing fleet, but we want to 
build up that energy supply.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK. I have a----
    Ms. Granholm. Hopefully, Congress will work on----
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you. I am going to take back my time, 
and I look--we need a--I have a whole bunch of yes-or-no 
questions here.
    Will you commit to supporting with--working with me on 
legislation to ban the import of Russian-sourced nuclear fuels?
    Ms. Granholm. Again, I would support making sure that our 
fleet is secure and that we have enough supply, and that means 
making it here. And I hope we can work together on a uranium 
strategy that ensures that we can have that for our own fleet.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Yes, and we got to ban natural gas--or we got 
to ban the nuclear coming from Russia. And then we got to work 
on getting supply here too.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Yes or no, do you agree that because China 
controls more than 90 percent of the critical materials used to 
make solar panels and batteries, that America is becoming 
dependent on one supplier, China, for our energy needs?
    Ms. Granholm. I think America is becoming more dependent on 
ourselves because of the investments that were made through the 
Inflation Reduction Act. The Loan Program Office has just 
financed several processing----
    Mrs. Rodgers. I don't see--nothing is being manufactured 
yet.
    Ms. Granholm. Well----
    Mrs. Rodgers. Yes or no, are you----
    Ms. Granholm. But it is going to be. It is going to be. 
That is what is so exciting, all the announcements that have 
been made about batteries, battery supply chain----
    Mrs. Rodgers. Reclaiming my time, are you aware that China 
uses slave labor, and is the largest polluter----
    Ms. Granholm. I am.
    Mrs. Rodgers [continuing]. In the world?
    How many critical mineral processing facilities do we have 
in the United States?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, just--that is exactly what I am saying, 
is that we must build more processing in the United States.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK.
    Ms. Granholm. And that is exactly----
    Mrs. Rodgers. Let's start, Madam Secretary----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. What the Inflation Reduction Act 
and----
    Mrs. Rodgers. Reclaiming my time----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. The Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law----
    Mrs. Rodgers. We--let's start with how many do we have 
right now. How many do we have right now?
    Ms. Granholm. We just--in fact, the Loan Program Office 
just financed three additional ones----
    Mrs. Rodgers. How many existing processing facilities----
    Ms. Granholm. We don't. We have not done that. It has been 
in Asia. This is exactly why we cannot stand by and allow that 
to continue. We want to bring----
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK, thank you.
    Ms. Granholm. We don't disagree, I don't think.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, OK.
    Ms. Granholm. We want to bring processing here, and do it 
here.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, thank you. How long does it take 
to permit----
    Ms. Granholm. Far too long.
    Mrs. Rodgers [continuing]. A critical minerals processing 
facility in the United States?
    Ms. Granholm. Far too long, far too long.
    Mrs. Rodgers. How many years?
    Ms. Granholm. It takes years. It is ridiculous and----
    Mrs. Rodgers. How many years?
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Unacceptable.
    Mrs. Rodgers. So how many years----
    Ms. Granholm. It shouldn't take----
    Mrs. Rodgers [continuing]. Does it take?
    Ms. Granholm. [continuing]. As long as it does.
    Mrs. Rodgers. How many years?
    Ms. Granholm. Let's work on slowing the--excuse me, let's 
work on speeding up----
    Mrs. Rodgers. You don't want to say how many years it 
takes----
    Ms. Granholm. Well, I don't----
    Mrs. Rodgers [continuing]. Because we are talking about 
years.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Responsibility for how many 
years it takes. It takes too long. It is years, and it 
shouldn't be.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK.
    Ms. Granholm. We should be doing it much more quickly.
    Mrs. Rodgers. So it is going to be years. And in the 
meantime----
    Ms. Granholm. Unless we do permitting reform.
    Mrs. Rodgers [continuing]. There is no processing in the 
United States of America, which means it all is going to go to 
China and come back----
    Ms. Granholm. No, no, that is exactly what we are not going 
to happen. That is why we have to do permitting reform----
    Mrs. Rodgers. If you don't have processing----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. And that is why we have to 
continue to invest.
    Mrs. Rodgers [continuing]. In the United States of America, 
it is----
    Ms. Granholm. But we are investing in it right now. That is 
why all of these new----
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, thank you.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Battery companies----
    Mrs. Rodgers. Reclaiming my time.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Have announced they are coming.
    Mrs. Rodgers. How--OK. Reclaiming my time here, would you 
support a prohibition on using taxpayer dollars to purchase 
renewable energy technologies that are manufactured with slave 
labor?
    Ms. Granholm. No.
    Mrs. Rodgers. You won't support a prohibition?
    Ms. Granholm. I am sorry, I thought you said would I 
support--I do not support slave labor making solar panels----
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK, would you support----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Or us supporting it in any way.
    Mrs. Rodgers [continuing]. A prohibition on using taxpayer 
dollars to do this, to purchase--would you support a 
prohibition on using taxpayer dollars to purchase renewable 
energy technologies manufactured with slave labor?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Would you support a ban on importing 
renewable energy technologies made with components mined or 
processed in factories that violate America's environmental 
standards?
    Ms. Granholm. I would have to look specifically at what you 
are saying on that. But I want for us to be manufacturing in 
the United States----
    Mrs. Rodgers. I do too.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. All the components, the full 
supply chain----
    Mrs. Rodgers. I do too. I do too.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. For solar, as well as for 
batteries.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Secretary. I 
think my point is it is the difference between what the dream 
is, or--and what reality is. And the reality is it is not 
happening here. It is happening--we are dependent upon China. 
And so we got to--we can't get--we got to get the--we can't get 
the cart before the horse.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady yields back. I will now 
recognize the ranking member, Mr. Pallone, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Secretary, again, thank you for being here. And as I 
mentioned in my opening statement--and you did, as well--over 
the last 2 years Congress has passed 2 landmark bills, the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, 
that give the Department tremendous resources to lower energy 
prices for everyday Americans while making our energy cleaner 
for everyone.
    So the budget request from your Department built on these 
laws by making additional investments in affordable, clean 
energy made right here in America, which you continue to 
stress. But the problem is that now the House Republicans' 
Default on America Act will seriously undermine the progress 
that we are beginning to make and that you have pointed out.
    So on the issue--back in March you wrote to Appropriations 
Committee Ranking Member DeLauro and said that capping DOE's 
fiscal year 2024 spending at 2022 levels would have 
catastrophic impacts on everyday Americans.
    And I would like to ask unanimous consent to insert your 
letter into the record, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Duncan. Without objection, so ordered.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr. Pallone. Thank you.
    So I would ask you, Madam Secretary, could you detail how 
the DOE budget cuts in the Default on America Act would have a 
devastating impact on everyday Americans? Do you know how many 
jobs, for example, might be jeopardized?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, first of all, I would say that people 
care about our investments in research and development. And so 
the slashing of, for example, 5,000 scientists in research at 
our 17 national labs would very much hinder our ability to be 
competitive globally. That is very important. It is my 
understanding, as well, that there is--there are rollbacks of 
the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits.
    And to the point we were just making, there--since the 
President has taken office, and this agenda to invest in 
America, there have been 150 battery companies or battery--
excuse me, 160--as of last week, 160 battery companies or 
supply chain companies that have announced they are coming to 
the United States, all the way from processing all the way to 
anode, cathode, separator material, electrolyte, critical--160. 
That policy works. And the idea of rolling that back would harm 
Americans all across the country in communities that will be 
benefiting from the jobs that would have been created by the 
policies that were supported by members of this panel and 
others.
    Mr. Pallone. Well, thank you. But you also wrote that the 
cuts would imperil and reduce the impact of the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law. So can you detail how the budget cuts would 
impact the bipartisan investments that Congress made just a 
year and a half ago from that----
    Ms. Granholm. Right. I mean, so those investments in next-
generation technologies that are in the process of being 
granted now give the United States a leg up on our competitors. 
They also make sure that we are able to deploy these 
technologies at home to make us more energy secure.
    Why would we cut the ability to undo decades of job losses 
to competitor nations when we now have policy that brings those 
jobs home and makes us more energy secure and makes products 
that are stamped ``Made in America'' and are used here and are 
perhaps sold elsewhere but we are making them here? That makes 
us energy secure. And cutting both the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law investments in those technologies as well as 
the deployment strategies in the Inflation Reduction Act would 
harm our Nation from an economic point of view as well as from 
an energy point of view.
    Mr. Pallone. Well, thank you so much. I mean, I started out 
by pointing out in my opening statement that, contrary to what 
some of my Republican colleagues are saying, is you are very 
much aware of the competition from China, you realize the 
threat, and that, you know, if you implement what the 
Republicans want to do with this Default Act, it is going to 
take us backwards, make us less competitive in a global 
economy, less able to compete with China. And, you know, the 
job numbers keep coming out.
    I mean, just in the last few days the unemployment is at an 
all-time low, even lower than it was a few months ago. And the 
jobs just, you know, keep coming in a very robust fashion. And 
I am just convinced that this Default Act would do just the 
opposite, completely reverse that in the way that you have 
outlined.
    So thank you so much for being here. I appreciate it.
    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman. I will go to Texas, Mr. 
Burgess, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Burgess. Thank you.
    And thanks for being here, Madam Secretary. Let me just ask 
you, can you just kind of briefly bring us up to date on where 
the Department is with the work on reprocessing spent nuclear 
fuel?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, thank you for asking that. We have a 
research program on that. We are working at the Idaho National 
Lab on that. It is smallish. It is not huge. I think it can be 
much larger. I think we should be looking at this to a much 
greater extent. So we have some initial research that is being 
done on that, but I think it is something that is worthy of 
expansion.
    Mr. Burgess. Well, if I can ask, what is holding us back? 
Why is it smallish? Why isn't it robust?
    Ms. Granholm. Historically--that is a good question. 
Historically, it just hasn't been a huge priority. But I think, 
with the help of Congress and some investment, we can make it a 
much more robust program.
    Mr. Burgess. Well, you have addressed the fact that we 
don't want to be buying our fuel stock for nuclear reactors----
    Ms. Granholm. Right.
    Mr. Burgess [continuing]. From Russia.
    Ms. Granholm. Right.
    Mr. Burgess. So it seems like the reutilization of spent 
nuclear fuel would make a lot of economic and geopolitical 
sense.
    I guess my concern is with--as big as a budget that you 
have and all of the money that has been pumped in with the 
Infrastructure Act and the Inflation Reduction Act and now the 
President's budget request, it just seems like a larger portion 
should be dedicated to that research because, I mean, if we 
want abundant, low-carbon fuel, that is the place we are going 
to get it, correct?
    Ms. Granholm. It is one of the places, certainly, and I 
would support authorization to expand our investment in that 
area.
    Mr. Burgess. Well, Mr. Chairman, I will just say I hope we 
can have a meaningful hearing on reprocessing of spent nuclear 
fuel. I think it made no sense when we were debating the 
President's big, big bill to be talking about investing all of 
this money in solar and wind,--geothermal even--and not talking 
about major investments in nuclear power.
    You used the term a few minutes ago, ``undergrounding.'' I 
think it was in relation to electric transmission lines. So is 
that--I mean, no one likes to have a big transmission line 
behind their house. So are you--is the agency studying the 
underground placement of large transmission lines?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes. As part of the resiliency funding that 
our Grid Deployment Office is administering, the resiliency 
component with undergrounding, particularly in areas where 
there's high wildfires, a great risk of wildfires, et cetera, 
is potentially one solution. Of course, it is more expensive, 
but it is also very expensive to build back.
    There is another component of efficiency that could also, I 
think, be very beneficial in terms of transmission acceptance, 
which is reconductoring existing lines to make them twice as 
efficient on existing infrastructure so that you have less of 
the NIMBY problem that is concerned with transmission.
    Mr. Burgess. I wasn't aware that reconductoring was a verb, 
but I appreciate you----
    Ms. Granholm. Like ``undergrounding,'' I guess.
    Mr. Burgess [continuing]. You bringing that to our 
attention.
    Well, it just seems like there--again, with all of the 
substantial investments that are being made into your agency, 
these are the types of things that I, for one, would be--I 
would be grateful to see some----
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Mr. Burgess [continuing]. Additional work. And we can talk 
all we want about the other sources of energy, but these are 
capturing energy efficiency, higher utilization of nuclear 
power--I mean, these are things that make a lot of sense in the 
Nation's armamentarium. At least it would seem to me that it 
would.
    I am concerned. We had a hearing in our Oversight and 
Investigation Subcommittee a few weeks ago, and your inspector 
general, Department of Energy inspector general, was here. I am 
really concerned about the--it is not just the amount of money 
that is going in to the agency but the rapidity with which the 
money is leaving the agency, so the velocity of spending, not 
just the amount of spending.
    Some of us were here when Solyndra became a four-letter 
word, really fearful of seeing projects where the money is, in 
fact, misdirected. Can you give us some insight on how you are 
controlling that?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes. First of all, we are grateful to have a 
great relationship with our inspector general. And on all of 
these programs, we consult with that office in how to make sure 
that there is no waste, fraud, and abuse, that it is designed 
in a way that is conducive to making sure that the taxpayer is 
protected. As you have seen in this budget, her budget has been 
increased by almost double, which is important, given the size 
of the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law funds that must go out.
    I am happy to continue to work with this committee in any 
way you deem important to have regular briefings on the 
cadence.
    Mr. Burgess. She said that wasn't enough. And I know my 
time is expired, and I am going to yield back, but--and that is 
the concern. The rapidity of the spending is going so fast, the 
money is going out the door so fast, the inspector general of 
the Department of Energy can't keep up with it. She says, ``I 
need more money to keep up with the money you have already 
invested.'' I realize that is a longer-term project, or a 
longer-term question, but we have got to stay focused on that.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time has expired----
    Mr. Burgess. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will yield back.
    Mr. Duncan [continuing]. And I now recognize the acting 
ranking member, Mr. Peters, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    It is great to see you again, Madam Secretary. Thanks for 
your good work.
    Last year, Congress provided record funding to build a 
cleaner and more secure energy system through historic 
legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act and the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. I want to thank you for 
your responses to the Chair of the committee, because I think 
there is a lot of room for agreement. Some of the talking 
points that I have heard from the other side are inconsistent 
with what you said today in terms of your support for nuclear 
power, for hydro, and for carbon capture, and all sorts of 
clean energy strategies and batteries. So I think we should be 
encouraged by that.
    And the other thing you talked about is that you 
acknowledge that things take too long. And I think in this 
Congress we need to work on speed. If we don't--we can have all 
the money in the world, but we will not succeed if we don't 
build things faster, particularly because a lot of what we want 
to do on climate action is build stuff, not slow stuff down. So 
I want to thank you and the White House for recognizing the 
need for that permitting reform, for using your existing 
authority to speed deployment, and I want to continue to work 
with you and your team to advance a bipartisan reform this year 
that will be durable over time because it is bipartisan.
    So first, I just want to make sure that we--you seem to 
agree that permitting and siting reform for clean energy is 
essential to meet our climate goals. Isn't that right?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Mr. Peters. Do you think we could solve our permitting 
challenges simply with funding for agencies, or do we need to 
both provide funding and additional underlying process and 
authority reforms?
    Ms. Granholm. I think there needs to be process as well as 
funding.
    Mr. Peters. Maybe you could just give us a little flavor 
for how permitting challenges impair your ability to deploy 
clean energy projects, and provide specific examples that might 
be on top of your mind.
    Ms. Granholm. In terms of what I would do to increase 
efficiency on permitting?
    Mr. Peters. Sure, or what the holdup is now, and how you 
would----
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, I mean, clearly, the holdups are the 
fact that you have processes that require reviews that are 
consecutive and not concurrent.
    Mr. Peters. Right.
    Ms. Granholm. And so now it takes twice as long, when 
things can be done concurrently. We want to make sure that we 
have some, for example, a better use--maybe a more liberal use 
of categorical, you know, exclusions----
    Mr. Peters. Right.
    Ms. Granholm. In particular, types of devices that have the 
same footprint, we shouldn't have to be doing a whole new study 
around it, assuming that the area is--you know, that there is 
not some sort of other violation.
    We should be doing a greater job of, for example, 
programmatic energy assessments to be able to take a swath of 
area and say, ``This is OK to be able to build on.''
    We should be developing more as more projects, more--bigger 
goals about how quickly we want to get there, perhaps some kind 
of time limit.
    We don't want to degrade the environmental laws, but we 
want to be able to administer them in a way that, where there 
is alacrity----
    Mr. Peters. Right.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Where we are moving quickly on 
them, and we can do that because, of course, slowness is--
impacts species because we will not be able to address climate 
change.
    Mr. Peters. And disadvantaged communities, by the way, 
sure, right?
    Ms. Granholm. Of course.
    Mr. Peters. Who are most affected by the pollution.
    Ms. Granholm. Of course, of course.
    Mr. Peters. Also, so you know, we saw something from one 
study that showed it takes, on average, 10 years to do one 
interstate transmission line.
    Ms. Granholm. Ridiculous.
    Mr. Peters. Seven years of that is process. So you and I 
see eye-to-eye on this. And I think transmission is going to be 
one of our big objectives. I passed--help pass the POWER On Act 
last year to give backstop siting authority to FERC. I think 
that is a good start.
    This week DOE issued a request for information on a new 
process for designated National Interest Electric Transmission 
Corridors, and that is going to be helpful and would focus on 
narrow routes proposed by applicants, as opposed to larger 
corridors designated from scratch by DOE. How do you think that 
approach can help advance and speed up transmission----
    Ms. Granholm. Well, first of all, glad to say that the 
approach is based upon a needs study that has been completed 
about where the most need is in the country.
    Number two is that this step that was taken this week is 
gleaning information from industry partners about how they 
think NIETC corridors should best be done. But what we want to 
do is to give them the ability to apply for NIETC corridor 
designation. That will happen in the Septemberish area. We 
close down the funding opportunity--excuse me, the notice of 
intent and the request for information.
    So this year we will have set the stage for rapid movement 
and designation of those corridors, and then it unlocks 
resources to be able to do that, whether it is the transmission 
financing resources, it could be the funding that comes from 
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that helps to fund those 
transmission lines. So all of that gets unlocked, and that will 
happen this year.
    Mr. Peters. And I am going to run out of time, but I do 
want to ask you the same question I have asked Mr. Landrieu, 
Mr. Podesta, this morning Secretary Raimondo: If there are ways 
that we need to help you speed things up through legislative 
changes, please let us know so we can get to work on them as 
soon as possible. Can you do that?
    Ms. Granholm. Absolutely.
    Mr. Peters. Thank you so much, and I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time is expired, and I will now 
go to Mr. Latta from Ohio for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Latta. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Madam Secretary, good to have you back. You said a little 
earlier that we can't ban Russian uranium until we have our own 
domestic industry built up. But industry has said they can't. 
They need to have the certainty if they are going to invest in 
that. Wouldn't Congress passing the ban with possible waivers 
send that market a signal and help provide the industry with 
that need, that certainty that we have to have out there?
    Ms. Granholm. It is possible, but I am worried--my worry is 
about the gap, right? We need to build up the supply here. And 
I think the way to do that is to work with Congress on a 
uranium strategy that gives us the ability to finance the 
processing, the conversion, the enrichment in the United 
States.
    So this was--we got a downpayment on that through the $700 
million, but it is just the tip of the iceberg. We need about 
2.1 billion and a revolving fund to be able to send the message 
both to industry and to not cut the legs out from under the 
existing----
    Mr. Latta. Well, because----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Fleet----
    Mr. Latta. You know, the fear out there, though, it is the 
time factor we have. And, you know, if you just keep putting it 
off, we just--I think we have to have a time limit out there 
that we make sure that the United States is going to take care 
of itself.
    Let me just go on another point that was brought up a 
little bit earlier, because I have--this is something I have 
been very interested and involved in with our spent nuclear 
rods. You know, you mentioned about that--you know, the United 
States is behind. France has been doing this for years. Not 
only is France doing it, but France is also reprocessing rods 
for other countries. So why are we lagging?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, I think this is the question. I mean, in 
France they--it is heavily subsidized by the French Government. 
And that could be one way of going. I think what we have been 
looking at in our research is how to commercialize it in a way 
where private entities can take this on.
    However, your point about us thinking differently about how 
we have done this is very important so that we can be 
independent, and I would eager----
    Mr. Latta. Well----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Be eager to have that 
conversation.
    Mr. Latta. Well, and it is really important because, again, 
just to finish up on this point, because, you know, if we go 
out there and you think about all the rods we have out there 
right now around the entire country----
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Mr. Latta [continuing]. We wouldn't need to worry about 
uranium for a little while, because we have got it right now.
    Let me move on to another area. You know, I am very 
concerned that the Biden administration and States like 
California are pursuing policies that will undermine the 
reliability of the grid. And you also mentioned a little 
earlier that we have to have enough transmission out there. And 
we--and, you know, there's proponents out there saying that we 
need to have EVs by 2035, but we also saw what happened in 
California around Labor Day of last year, where we saw the 
Governor saying that people needed to turn their air 
conditioners up and not plug their cars in.
    And then the other problem has been--is that, you know, 
when you are talking about transmission and where we are going 
to get it, that, for example, EIA in 2019--in--these are, like, 
2019 estimates--that the United States would need to generate 
at least 50 percent more electricity to power all the electric 
vehicle fleet. And that is 4 years ago. And we have been 
seeing, you know, a push for even more.
    With the administration pushing for these unreasonable 
standards, I believe that--and we are seeing today we are going 
to be shutting down coal and gas-fired power plants around the 
country and losing that baseload capacity out there. What is 
the plan to generate the levels of electricity for this country 
that we are going to need for all of our vehicles and 
appliances, and especially your home State, Michigan, Ohio, 
mine? We are heavy manufacturing. We need baseload. It is not 
intermittent power. Where are we going to get it from?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, so a couple of responses to that.
    Number one is that the wind and solar are intermittent. We 
know that. And we have to add the technology associated with 
battery storage to make them more like baseload. And we are 
making great breakthroughs in that. And in many places they 
have already started to deploy wind/solar combinations that get 
them a reliable grid.
    However, it is clear that we--this is a transition. We 
cannot flip a switch automatically and expect that everything 
is going to be 100 percent clean tomorrow. This is why what the 
EPA did today was to give a ramp that goes to 2040 so that we 
have the time to be able to develop and deploy the 
technologies.
    Mr. Latta. Just to reclaim my time, because, you know, when 
you have been out and heard from the industry and all like 
that, they said we just can't get there by 2035. And even if it 
is 2040, they are saying we got a problem.
    Let me let me finish up on one other question, because 
again, I am concerned about some of the proposed actions out 
there for U.S. consumers that prefer top-loading machines, and 
the proposed standard would also drastically increase the 
upfront cost of basic new clothes washers by nearly $200, 
according to the Department's own estimates, which would have a 
particularly negative impact on low-income consumers.
    Will you commit that any final DOE clothes washer standard 
will guarantee that consumers will continue to have access to 
top-loading washers of various capacities without a significant 
price surge for consumers?
    Ms. Granholm. We are always concerned about the price, both 
short-term in the upfront costs as well as the long-term price 
that--the savings that are generated, particularly for lower-
income people. This is an open proposed rule----
    Mr. Latta. But is it something----
    Ms. Granholm. So we are eager to hear----
    Mr. Latta. Just if we can get a yes or no on that, that you 
will, you know, make sure that we are not going to see these 
increases, that we need to--DOE be out there saying that we are 
not going to have these high increase for these people across 
the country with these top-loading washing machines. Would DOE 
commit to that?
    Ms. Granholm. We are--I would commit that we are not going 
to raise significantly the price of top-loading washing 
machines----
    Mr. Latta. OK. Well, Madam Secretary, I am going to take 
that for a yes. Thank you.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman. I will now go to Mrs. 
Fletcher from Texas for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Fletcher. Thank you, Chairman Duncan, and thank you, 
Secretary Granholm, for being here and for sharing your 
thoughts with us today.
    As we have heard from several folks today, the legislation 
that we passed in the last Congress has been historic and 
transformational, and is really important in investing in 
technologies that are going to power our future while reducing 
our emissions and helping us address our climate goals and 
achieve them.
    And we have already seen the market respond, in addition to 
what we are seeing in terms of investments from the Government. 
We are seeing, I think, $242 billion of new clean energy 
investments have already been announced. We are certainly 
seeing that in Houston, and we are seeing some of the 
challenges, as well. And so I want to follow up on some of the 
questions that you were just discussing with Mr. Peters, 
specifically around permitting reform, and drill down a little 
bit.
    I really appreciated your testimony about how to address 
some of the challenges that we see, and it is certainly 
something that I hear from my constituents, and one area in 
particular I wanted to ask you about.
    We have seen exploding demand for carbon capture 
utilization and storage. The Houston Carbon Capture Storage 
Alliance was recently formed to really take--to advance what is 
one of, I think, the most--the biggest CCUS opportunities in 
the world. The collection of energy companies, organizations, 
academia, and institutions and experts are working together so 
that the region can store 100 million metric tons of carbon per 
year by 2040. So this is really an incredible opportunity.
    And the work that DOE has done up to this point has made 
this possible. But there is still work to do, as you have 
already testified. And I think one of the challenges we see is 
that, while the technological capabilities exist and the 
funding to deploy the technology is included in the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, there are still 
barriers to a functioning ecosystem. And it is primarily 
relating to permitting, how we build the infrastructure to do 
this to transport and store the carbon. And you know, also, 
permitting class 6 wells is hindered by these long regulatory 
timelines that you were discussing.
    And so, while these aren't the primary jurisdiction of the 
Department of Energy, I understand, I do think the Department 
has a role in convening the stakeholders and working together 
with other agencies to really advance a whole-of-government 
approach to ensuring success for CCUS. So I would love it if 
you could talk for a minute about what steps you have taken to 
work with EPA and other relevant agencies to really drive a 
whole-of-government approach to addressing these challenges, in 
particular when it comes to CCUS.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, we are in constant contact with EPA 
about this, because this whole effort to try to sequester is 
not going to work unless you have a place for it to be 
sequestered in. And less on EPA, but more for our Loan Programs 
office, we have the ability now to finance the pipelines to be 
able to move the CO2, as well--and hydrogen, as well.
    So we are--we have to do all of it. We have got to make 
sure we have the acceptance, as well, which--obviously, there 
is acceptance, you know, in Texas, in the Houston area. We have 
to make sure that we are bringing along the community as we 
gain that acceptance. We have to make sure we can safely 
sequester it, and we have to make sure we can transport. All of 
that infrastructure is necessary, and now we have the tools to 
be able to help industry get there.
    But the permitting side and the government side of this has 
got to be addressed, and we have to move with greater speed. 
And I hope--I mean, everybody keeps talking about it--right, 
left, White House--so I am hopeful that we can all agree that 
we need to do this and compromise to get that done.
    Mrs. Fletcher. Well, thank you. I hope so too. And I 
appreciate your commitment to doing that. And I think you 
really serve in such an important capacity as a convener here. 
And I know the interest is sincere on our side of the aisle, 
and it is certainly something I hear about every day when I 
talk to my constituents about the challenges and, really, the 
opportunities that are in front of us.
    With that in mind, I want to switch gears a little bit and 
follow up on a question, touch on something that Mr. Pallone 
mentioned in his opening remarks. I agree that the Department's 
use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve over the last year has 
been very important in bringing down the cost of gasoline.
    Last year, President Biden announced that the 
administration was targeting a price range of roughly 67 to 72 
dollars per barrel of crude to refill the SPR, and that is a 
$20-per-barrel profit. So I understand that the Department is 
currently completing long-mandated modernization work on some 
of the caverns, and that the cavern infrastructure right now is 
not ready to receive, physically, some oil. But I want to point 
out that the oil markets are currently backward-dated, and that 
means that the future prices are lower than the current prices, 
and oil futures for this fall are currently within the 
Department's target price range for purchase.
    So I would love to ask, and maybe get the answer in the 
record, how the DOE can take full advantage of the current low 
oil prices to refill the SPR, and how--or if any additional 
authorities are needed from Congress to be able to do so.
    Ms. Granholm. No, I think we have the authorities to be 
able to do it.
    Right now, in addition to the maintenance that is 
happening, the life extension program, we are also doing 
congressionally mandated sales. And that congressionally 
mandated sale of 26 million barrels will be completed by June. 
And it is at that point where we will flip the switch and then 
seek to purchase.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady's time has expired.
    Ms. Granholm. So we hope to be able to take advantage----
    Mrs. Fletcher. Thank you.
    Mr. Duncan. I am going to go to Mr. Guthrie from Kentucky.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you very much.
    Thank you, Madam Secretary. Brett Guthrie from Kentucky, 
but I lived a year in Grand Rapids----
    Ms. Granholm. All right.
    Mr. Guthrie [continuing]. Learning the automotive supply 
business. And, you know, the EV is exciting in my area. I 
represent I-65 between Louisville and Nashville--obviously, not 
south of the Tennessee border, but essentially between 
Louisville and Nashville--and we have BlueOvalSK, which is 
locating there in Elizabethtown, and then Envision coming. And 
so it is important.
    But it has been brought up a couple of times, one of our 
biggest concerns is baseload power just to supply the battery 
plants, not necessarily--I mean, it is set for what they are 
constructing, but the issue is for moving forward, and 
expanding baseload power. So I just think there's a lot of 
concerns in moving to electric vehicles. There's just a lot of 
concerns.
    And it seems that, when we talk to members of the 
administration or people who are promoting the fast transition, 
that a lot of the concerns get just dismissed away--``Oh, we 
will figure that out and we will move forward.'' And you used 
the term we are not going to ``flip a switch.'' I know that you 
have--that the administration has put out you are going to be 
two-thirds battery electric vehicles by 2032. So it is 10 
years.
    And, you know, it takes about 5 to 7 years to launch a new 
product for automotive. And that 5 to 7 years actually could be 
faster, I could tell you that, but it is when you have existing 
supply base and people just retool their factories. We are 
talking about building new battery plants, securing lithium, 
securing a lot of other things. And I don't think many people 
in automotive, if they are giving you a real answer, would say 
that is doable in the--by 2032, because that is 10 million 
vehicles.
    So if you take--we sell 15 million cars in America--that is 
10 million vehicles. So if we could do half of that, if we 
could do half of that, which is a big goal if we could do half 
of that, but half of that means two-thirds of the fleet will 
be--would be 8 million because you have--half of that would be 
5 million electrical vehicles. Or if you even say two-thirds of 
that, we are talking about selling 10 million cars in America. 
And I know you were Governor of Michigan in 2009, when we sold 
9 million cars in America, and what did that do to Michigan? 
What did that do to America? And what did it do to the world 
when the automotive industry shrunk in half?
    Now, if you stated two-thirds--if we can't hit that two-
thirds goal, you are talking about shrinking the new sales in 
America to whatever that level of two-thirds is.
    Ms. Granholm. So we don't want to put the cart before the 
horse, as you say. We want to make sure we have a grid that is 
capable of taking on electrification. We have--want to make 
sure that the goals--and these are just goals, right--the auto 
industry put forth a goal of half of its fleet being electric 
by 2030. Obviously, that is the industry goal. That is the 
administration's goal by 2030.
    We don't know how fast this is going. We know that electric 
vehicle sales doubled this past year. We know that it is----
    Mr. Guthrie. Right.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Really accelerating. But to your 
point, we have to make sure that we have a grid that can 
withstand it and that we have enough electricity on that grid 
to be able to make it, which is, again, why--I will just be 
honest--the tools that have been given to be able to 
incentivize the deployment of additional energy resources are 
really important. And I am grateful to Congress for those who 
supported that, because it will help us to be able to ensure 
that we have a reliable grid.
    Mr. Guthrie. Well, thanks for saying ``goals,'' because I 
say that to a lot of people in automotive. This is--you know, I 
know it is 2032. I don't think anybody can get there, but we 
are going to move--well, things like this happen in Congress, 
delays, and I say that, and they say to me, they said, you 
know, ``This is an EPA rule. It is not an administration goal, 
and we can't invest to a goal. We have to invest to what the 
rules are.'' And if you are going to tell me--which I can't 
tell them, ``Hopefully my colleagues here could fix this,'' but 
we can't say, ``Well, don't invest according to the rules 
because somewhere down the road we are going to fix this.'' 
This is really changing the investment in the automotive 
industry.
    So let's say we get to 5 years down the road, and you are 
saying, well, maybe just half, or maybe just a third, since we 
can't get there. Well, people have already got out of 
powertrain, people aren't making transmissions anymore. And so 
you are really risking the supply chain. You are really risking 
moving forward.
    So just to say it is a goal would be one thing, but putting 
in as a rule, that--you can't get an investment from capital 
suppliers. I mean, it is really concerning, unless we really 
think--and if all the automotive people get in the room and 
say--with honesty and say that we think we can get there in 
2032, that is one thing. But I don't think you will hear that 
if you get a good answer.
    Ms. Granholm. Well, I will say that these rules have been 
modeled, and the technologies that can allow existing baseload 
to stay online and meet the rules exist. And Congress has given 
tools to make sure that they are profitable.
    So the increase, for example, in carbon--the amount of 
money for carbon capture, so that you can keep a baseload plant 
online, that is really quite amazing and will help to ensure 
that you have a reliable and growing grid.
    Mr. Guthrie. Well, baseload is one thing. So that is 
important. But it is also--it is getting the supply chain 
together to go to two--you are completely changing the 
automotive industry. It is not--and that is what you want to 
do, I understand that, but it is not--you can't just flip a 
switch and--I am just really concerned we are going to really 
disrupt the automotive chain and the supply chain, which 
affects, as you know, the economy of America.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, 160 battery companies coming to America. 
That is pretty exciting.
    Mr. Guthrie. I agree with you, but I am not sure we are 
going to get to 10 million cars in 10 years. That is the 
question. Thank you.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time has expired. I will now go 
to Ms. Matsui for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Matsui. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank 
you, Madam Secretary, for being here and being part of this 
great discussion.
    You know, each year I lead an appropriations letter with 
Senator Cortez Mastro and Chairman Carper and Congresswoman 
Clarke supporting increased funding for DOE clean 
transportation programs. Programs like the Vehicle Technologies 
Office produce cutting-edge innovations that are crucial to 
keeping the U.S. one step ahead of our competitors.
    Medium- and heavy-duty vehicles are the largest mobile 
source of smog-forming pollutants, particulate matter, carbon 
monoxide, and other air toxics. Some heavy-vehicle classes, 
like busses, are ripe for electrification, while others, like 
long-haul trucks, are more challenging.
    The question is, what is DOE doing to help decarbonize 
long-haul trucking, and what technology or infrastructure 
challenges do we need to overcome in order to eliminate 
pollution from long-haul trucking?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, thanks for that question, too, because 
our Vehicle Technologies Office has been working on this, and 
the long-haul trucking largely has been focused on both--
biofuels is one----
    Ms. Matsui. Right.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. But also hydrogen fuel cells, 
very important, especially for fleet.
    And there is a lot of work being done now on large-scale 
batteries, as well. Those are more expensive. We will see how 
that goes. But DOE's long-term research in batteries for 
vehicles tells you we can reduce the cost. Eighty percent has 
been--the cost has been reduced 80 percent for batteries over 
the past decade. So the continuation of that is very important, 
as well as looking at the materials that can build those 
stronger, bigger batteries----
    Ms. Matsui. Yes.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. And substitute out for the more 
expensive materials that are currently in the lithium ion 
batteries.
    Ms. Matsui. Yes, and I was going to follow up on that 
vehicle battery research, because research into battery 
technology for electric vehicles is a significant focus of the 
fiscal year 2024 budget for the Vehicle Technologies Office.
    Now, foreign battery companies have made significant 
advancements in battery technology in recent years. Madam 
Secretary, what new-generation battery technologies is DOE 
working on, and, if commercialized, how would these new 
technologies potentially impact the range and cost of electric 
vehicles?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes. So obviously, there are batteries for 
electric vehicles and there are batteries for long-duration 
storage.
    Ms. Matsui. Right.
    Ms. Granholm. And the technologies sometimes they share and 
learn from one another, and sometimes they are quite different.
    For long-duration storage, you can use things like iron, 
iron flow batteries, because they are bigger and you don't have 
to worry about putting them into a vehicle, right?
    Ms. Matsui. Sure.
    Ms. Granholm. But for vehicles, you want to have substitute 
materials that lessen your reliance on very expensive materials 
like cobalt. And so, for example, Argonne National Lab is 
working on a lithium manganese battery that lessens our 
reliance on cobalt and that gets you very great performance for 
larger vehicles. That kind of technology is what we are looking 
at.
    We have got our 17 labs, probably 10 of them are working on 
next-generation materials and substitutes for both long-
duration energy storage as well as for vehicles.
    Ms. Matsui. OK, that is great. Thank you.
    My district includes--in Sacramento includes a 
decommissioned nuclear generating station at Rancho Seco. And I 
bring this up every year: The power station closed in 1989, but 
the spent nuclear fuel is still awaiting transport to a 
consolidated storage facility. Each year I lead an 
appropriations letter in support of DOE's interim storage 
program. And after years of inaction, I am pleased to see the 
recent progress with the consent-based siting approach.
    Madam Secretary, can you describe how the $53 million in 
the fiscal year 2024 budget will advance the consent-based 
siting approach?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, thank you for that question.
    We issued last year a request for information to find out 
whether there were communities that might be willing to raise 
their hand. And then we issued a funding opportunity 
announcement. We got a number of communities that were willing 
to enter into those discussions. We will be announcing those 
awards, I want to say, this spring. And then, after they have 
the opportunity to do the work that they need to do to prepare, 
we will then follow up in 2024 with the ability to be able to 
start the conversation about actually doing interim storage.
    Now, we can negotiate, we can have these discussions, but 
we don't have the authority--DOE does not--Congress needs to 
give us the authority to actually help site the facilities, 
both--whether it is interim--and I will say that there is, you 
know, there is concern if you do an interim one, does that mean 
I am going to be the long-term place as well?
    Ms. Matsui. Well, yes.
    Ms. Granholm. And that authority also needs to be----
    Ms. Matsui. Well, and I am looking at--you know, as the 
administration pursues a new fleet of advanced reactors, you 
know, we have to think about the waste storage. I think----
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Ms. Matsui [continuing]. Some people are thinking--not 
knowing that we--what kind of waste are we going to have, how 
are we going to deal with it? And if we can take care of this, 
it would be really important for our thinking about the nuclear 
industry to move in a positive way.
    Ms. Granholm. Absolutely.
    Ms. Matsui. Thank you very much.
    Ms. Granholm. Thank you.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady's time has expired. I will now 
go to Mr. Griffith for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Griffith. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I 
appreciate it.
    Secretary Granholm, are you aware that China reportedly 
permitted or began construction on coal units equivalent to 
about 2 coal-fired power plants per week in 2022?
    Ms. Granholm. They are the world's largest emitter.
    Mr. Griffith. And they are building more coal plants. That 
is correct, is it not?
    Ms. Granholm. That is correct.
    Mr. Griffith. And I surmise that last year's renewed 
construction, based on the reports that I have read, is likely 
in response to grid failures that China experienced last summer 
due to heat and drought.
    Especially after today's announcement of its newest 
crackdown on fossil fuel plants, what are we going to do in our 
country to mitigate coal and natural gas power plant closures 
and ensure that America doesn't fall prey to grid failures like 
China did?
    Ms. Granholm. A great question, and it is one of the 
reasons why the funding for carbon capture and sequestration, 
the amount of money going to $85 per ton for sequestration, is 
an incentive to install decarbonization technologies on coal 
plants and on natural gas plants as well. That will enable 
those plants to keep running.
    If they are a plant that has already announced that they 
are closing, they don't have to install any of that stuff. But 
if they are going to be long term, I think because of the 
resources that has been given, it allows for them to continue 
to operate, but without CO<INF>2</INF> emissions.
    Mr. Griffith. Well, and based on your statement just now, 
if you are already planning to close, or if you are going to 
close, you don't have to spend the money. Isn't that actually 
going to do the opposite, and encourage more plants to close 
and therefore put our grid at risk?
    Ms. Granholm. I think that those are private investment 
decisions by those--by the operators----
    Mr. Griffith. Driven by your policies.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Of those plants.
    Well, I don't think so. I think we want to make sure that 
we have decarbonized our electric system, and that is why the 
technologies exist.
    Mr. Griffith. We are just going to have to disagree on 
that, Madam Chair--or Madam Secretary. I appreciate it.
    Cathy McMorris Rodgers and I, in my capacity--her in 
capacity as Chair of the full committee and my capacity as 
Chair of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, wrote 
to you last year requesting a briefing to include specific 
information regarding the Department's October 2022 
announcement of a $200 million award to Microvast and the 
Department's review of potential ties to the Chinese Communist 
Party. That requested briefing has not occurred, and your 
written response from February of this year did not provide the 
requested information. Instead, the Department stated that it 
would not provide more information on this award while it was 
still undergoing a ``post-selection, risk-based due diligence 
review.''
    Is it a--and here is the question: Is it standard procedure 
for the Department to begin conducting due diligence reviews 
more than 3 months after it announces an award?
    Ms. Granholm. The Department conducts reviews after the 
announcement of a selection, because that always happens, and 
every person, every entity that is selected gets a letter 
saying that this is not a done deal, you have to go through a 
due diligence process.
    With the additional funds that have been now coming through 
the Department of Energy and the grant funding, we have set up 
a process that is informed by the Committee on Foreign 
Investment in the United States to ensure that we vet everyone 
that has made it through the technical reviews. So there's 
several layers of review to be able to be eligible for funding. 
In the instance you have described, not a dollar has gone out.
    So just to be clear: There is a serious process of vetting 
that is going with everyone that was selected now, and that is 
a serious looking under the hood to make sure taxpayers are 
protected and that no IP is going to China.
    Mr. Griffith. And has that always been the case when you 
all do an award?
    Ms. Granholm. We have always done vetting, but this time we 
are--because of the new funding that we have, set up a 
different and more intense process that is involving the 
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and their 
process.
    Mr. Griffith. And I am not against that, but I am curious. 
When did you all develop this? Was it before the grants were 
announced, or--I forgot the words you just used, but before the 
grants were----
    Ms. Granholm. Selected.
    Mr. Griffith. Selected, there you go. Thank you. Before the 
grants were selected, or was this a process that came about 
subsequent because of some of the negative press you got about 
Microvast?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, let me just say that we have always had 
a vetting process. And now--in the fall we set up a more 
intensive vetting process because of the additional funding 
that is coming through the Department of Energy and making sure 
that we can protect the taxpayer and ensure that China is not 
getting funding from us.
    Mr. Griffith. So it would be subsequent to our letter?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, again, I don't know when your letter 
was----
    Mr. Griffith. October of 2022.
    Ms. Granholm. I don't know exactly.
    Mr. Griffith. You can get back to me. My time is up, but 
you can get back to me.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, for sure.
    Mr. Griffith. I would appreciate it. Thank you.
    Ms. Granholm. You bet.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time has expired. I will now go 
to Mr. Tonko for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    And Secretary Granholm, thank you for your leadership, 
outstanding leadership, with the agency. Thank you to the 
Department for all you are doing. You have been in my district, 
and they really believe in the efforts that you are making, and 
we see them as strong partnerships that will really get us to 
this transformation.
    Now, we hear a lot of talk today about a vision of a clean 
energy economy, and then the fundamentals of assets, resources, 
infrastructure, and the like. But it seems as though we part 
company where there is a message from some that will make 
certain that never happens, and others are messaging we are 
investing in the now and the future to make certain it happens.
    So study after study has found that the clean energy 
transition will require massive investments and buildout of our 
electric grid, especially transmission lines, which we know can 
take close to a decade to get through the siting, permitting, 
and construction process. I would like to ask about some of the 
actions DOE is taking to accelerate these electric 
infrastructure projects.
    Yesterday the White House permitting announcement confirmed 
that DOE has entered into an interagency memorandum of 
understanding using its authority under the Federal Power Act. 
So, Madam Secretary, can you inform us about anything happening 
with the MOU?
    And what is DOE's role as the lead Federal agency for 
coordinating the authorization of these transmission lines?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, so the memorandum of understanding 
involves several of the land agencies and those who do 
permitting and the Department of Energy. And under the Federal 
Power Act section 216(h), it gives the Department of Energy the 
ability to set a timeframe, a timetable for the granting and 
the processing of permits. And so we will be shepherding them 
with more rapidity.
    Mr. Tonko. Great. And how will this improve interagency 
coordination, help permit transmission lines more quickly 
without sacrificing important environmental reviews?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, it is very important to make sure that 
we do the environmental reviews properly, but we can do them 
simultaneously. You don't have to wait to do a concurrent. And 
to get the agencies at the same table on the same project to 
identify what the barriers are and move through it quickly to 
develop the mitigation strategies--if they are necessary--
together, that helps to move things with greater speed.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you. And offshore wind energy is also 
going to require major transmission planning and investments. 
Several studies have found that using a system of shared 
transmission infrastructure where multiple projects from 
different developers are connected offshore will be more cost 
effective and less environmentally disruptive.
    Earlier this year, DOE released a major offshore 
transmission study which identified interoperability of 
electric equipment as a potential barrier to this vision of 
shared offshore infrastructure. So can DOE play a role working 
with project developers and transmission equipment 
manufacturers to support the development of standards to 
overcome these interoperability challenges?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, and this is part of what the MOU sets 
up, is a way for us to work together with the private sector as 
well as the agencies to move more quickly.
    We did a study both on the Atlantic and we are starting one 
now on the West Coast as well, so that we can have the same 
kind of speedy process and coordination.
    Mr. Tonko. Super. We also need to get more out of our 
existing infrastructure. Grid-enhancing technologies and 
reconductoring of existing lines can make them more efficient 
and reduce line loss. Building new infrastructure faster is 
critical, but what is DOE doing to ensure that we are getting 
the most out of the infrastructure that we already have in 
place?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, I love this question, because I do think 
it is one of the solutions to how we get around some of the 
NIMBY problems.
    So under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Grid 
Deployment Office has $5 billion for enhancements of grid 
technologies. Reconductoring is one of those. And we are 
hopeful that we get a number of applicants who are willing to 
use existing lines just to put twice as much power on them by 
using more efficient materials.
    Mr. Tonko. Great, setting a great tone.
    Finally, on the Inflation Reduction Act, I know DOE is 
working hard to implement all the new programs, including 
electric appliance rebates for low- and moderate-income 
households. This program will be administered by State and 
Tribal governments. Madam Secretary, can you provide any 
updates on when guidance for this program may be released?
    And can you discuss how DOE is working to provide support 
and tools to States so that their programs will be consistent 
and useful for both consumers and retailers?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, very important. This is a new program, 
so we did a request for information to make sure we got the 
input of stakeholders, and that includes retailers because we 
want the rebates to be taken at the point of sale. How quickly 
can we do that? How--what does that look like?
    Each State will be administering the rebate programs, and 
so we want to make sure we set up that guidance in a way that 
is very clear and consistent across States so that there is not 
a patchwork. That guidance and the rebate money will flow to 
the States this fall in order for it to be available for this 
winter season.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, and thank you for leading us into a 
transformational era. Thanks.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time has expired. I will go now 
to the Chair of the environmental subcommittee, Mr. Johnson, 
for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Madam Secretary, 
thank you for being here today. I want to discuss a pressing 
subject that both the Energy Subcommittee and my Environment, 
Manufacturing, and Critical Materials Subcommittee have been 
working on for some time now, and that is the issue of critical 
minerals, rare earths, and the precarious nature of the supply 
chain. It is a national security issue. This is a defining 
challenge for policymakers here in the 21st century.
    So, Madam Secretary, for the record, do you agree that the 
United States needs to reduce its dependance on unfriendly 
nations and secure the supply chains for sometimes volatile 
global commodities like lithium, cobalt, graphite, and rare 
earths, among others?
    Ms. Granholm. I do.
    Mr. Johnson. OK, great, because that seems to contradict 
your remarks a couple of weeks ago before the Senate.
    Now, I truly wish we had time to get into your claim, for 
example, that--in that Senate hearing--that we can electrify 
the military by 2030. Because based on my 26-year Air Force 
career, I don't even know how to process that. But in your 
reasoning for this statement that you made, you said we need to 
bolster energy security by ``reducing our reliance on the 
volatility of globally traded fossil fuels.''
    So, Madam Secretary, I am trying to connect the dots. Are 
you telling us that dependance on globally traded fossil fuels 
is too volatile and dangerous for our military, therefore we 
should electrify, but somehow making our military dependent on 
other globally traded commodities and enormous additional 
amounts of lithium, cobalt, and rare earths is an improvement 
of some kind?
    Ms. Granholm. I believe we should have the full supply 
chain----
    Mr. Johnson. Just a yes----
    Ms. Granholm. No, I----
    Mr. Johnson. Just a yes or no.
    Ms. Granholm. First of all, that was a question that was 
asked of me by Senator Ernst. And the--I was agreeing with what 
the military wanted.
    Mr. Johnson. OK.
    Ms. Granholm. Because they have said----
    Mr. Johnson. No, but I am asking you----
    Ms. Granholm. Let me just finish this, though.
    Mr. Johnson. No, I don't want a filibuster----
    Ms. Granholm. This is a really important clarification----
    Mr. Johnson [continuing]. Madam Secretary----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Because they have said----
    Mr. Johnson. I don't want a filibuster.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. That the----
    Mr. Johnson. I want you to answer the question.
    Ms. Granholm. I am not filibustering, I am clarifying.
    Mr. Johnson. Do you think that it is responsible to make 
the military dependent upon those volatile commodities?
    Ms. Granholm. No, I think the military should be dependent 
on----
    Mr. Johnson. But you said that----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Supply chains from here, from 
here.
    Mr. Johnson [continuing]. In that hearing.
    Ms. Granholm. No----
    Mr. Johnson. You said they should----
    Ms. Granholm. You won't let me explain. That hearing--I 
believe what the military said, which is they believe they can 
electrify nontactical vehicles----
    Mr. Johnson. Well, you just confirmed that.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Nontactical vehicles----
    Mr. Johnson. So would you agree----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. By 2035, nontactical vehicles--
--
    Mr. Johnson. Madam Secretary, reclaiming my time, I am 
asking the questions, please.
    Ms. Granholm. I know, but you won't let me answer.
    Mr. Johnson. Would you agree that these critical minerals 
are, in fact, volatile and controlled in many cases by 
unfriendly nations like China, and become--could become scarce 
in a conflict? Do you agree with that?
    Ms. Granholm. Right now, but that is why----
    Mr. Johnson. OK, great.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. We have a strategy to be able to 
get----
    Mr. Johnson. So, Madam Secretary, I actually agree with 
you----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Extraction here.
    Mr. Johnson [continuing]. That we want to become more 
secure in all our critical energy resources. Let's produce more 
of it here at home.
    Ms. Granholm. Right.
    Mr. Johnson. But the fact of the matter is we have never, 
ever been as dependent on OPEC for oil than we are on China 
right now for the critical materials to do this electrification 
that you are advocating for.
    The 7-year timeframe that you suggested to electrify the 
military is a recipe for further dangerous dependance on China 
for these materials that our military and civilian fleets of 
vehicles, for that matter, would need.
    So you told the Senate we need to double down on the status 
quo and stop being dependent on volatile commodities like 
fossil fuels, but you just said that you want to secure the 
supply chain. So which is it? Because you can't do both.
    Ms. Granholm. Number one, I support the military's 
decision----
    Mr. Johnson. No, but----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. To try to go electric by 2035.
    Mr. Johnson. I asked you a different question.
    Ms. Granholm. No, you didn't.
    Mr. Johnson. Which is it?
    Ms. Granholm. And number two----
    Mr. Johnson. Do you think we should be--do we--should 
secure our supply chains, or----
    Ms. Granholm. Here, yes, I do.
    Mr. Johnson [continuing]. Do you think we should be 
dependent on China?
    Ms. Granholm. And that is exactly what the President's 
agenda is allowing us to do, is to----
    Mr. Johnson. Well----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Both extract and process here in 
the United States.
    Mr. Johnson. You say one thing when you are over in the 
Senate, and you say another thing when you are over here, and 
your comments don't match, Madam Secretary. And that is what--
--
    Ms. Granholm. Well----
    Mr. Johnson [continuing]. Is confusing us.
    Ms. Granholm. Unfortunately, you are twisting the words.
    Mr. Johnson. That is what is confusing the rest of the 
American people.
    For the record, would you commit to working with your 
agency and your experts to better study our dependance on 
critical energy resources and identify ways to increase 
production, refining, and processing of those critical 
materials right here at home?
    Ms. Granholm. We are doing that, and absolutely.
    Mr. Johnson. Mr. Chair, I yield back.
    Ms. Granholm. One point of agreement.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time has expired. I now go to 
Mr. Veasey from Texas for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Veasey. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.
    Madam Secretary, last Congress the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law invested a historic $1.2 trillion in our 
Nation's infrastructure, and the Inflation Reduction Act 
provided 369 billion in investments for growing domestic 
cleaner energy. These laws are already creating new jobs, they 
are already cutting costs for working families, and they are 
helping America be more competitive in this space.
    Under no circumstances--absolutely under no circumstances 
do we want China to be the leaders in this space, particularly 
with the world being so thirsty for a lot of these newer 
technologies. And so I thank you for being here today to answer 
these questions. And before I get specifically to mine, I 
wanted to give you the opportunity to take 30 seconds to 
clarify your position on the question that Mr. Johnson was 
asking you.
    Ms. Granholm. Number one, I support the military's goal of 
electrifying the nontactical vehicles by 2035 and the tactical 
vehicles by 2050. That is a goal. I support the generals.
    Number two, I also support the bringing of the supply chain 
for batteries home so that we are reliant on us, on our land, 
on our processing, and on our workers to make us energy 
independent.
    Mr. Veasey. Thank you very much, Madam Secretary.
    In the carbon management liftoff report the Department 
released a few weeks ago, your Department estimated that the 
U.S. could need up to 1.8 billion tons per year of 
CO<INF>2</INF> removal by 2050. And right now we only have 20 
million. Can you talk about how carbon removal programs that 
were authorized under the Energy Act and the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law are helping create a domestic carbon removal 
industry that will be necessary to help us get to the scale of 
carbon renewal in just 27 years?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, and thank you for your leadership on 
this, the SCALE Act obviously providing such an impetus for us 
to be able to use the Loan Program Office to be able to fund 
the infrastructure necessary for carbon--the movement of 
CO<INF>2</INF> as well as the sequestration of it, and to be 
able to finance that in a large-scale manner is very important.
    In addition, the ability to be able to finance and pay for 
the sequestration at $85 per metric--per ton is critical for us 
to create that market. So we have both now supply and demand, 
and the ability to be able to move it, that we are working on 
all at once. But that market is essential for us to get to our 
decarbonization goals.
    Mr. Veasey. Absolutely. And I also want to zero in on the 
Carbon Dioxide Transportation Infrastructure Finance and 
Innovation Act, which I secured the inclusion within the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Can you talk a little bit about 
LPL's implementation of that program and when we might start to 
see the first loans being put out for that program?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, it is my understanding that there have 
been several applicants for that provision to be able--and they 
are in discussions now with the Loan Programs Office. The loan 
programs process is very rigorous, and so--and we want it to 
be. And so we hope that we will be able to see some 
announcements later this year.
    Mr. Veasey. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. We are just trying to calculate. Votes have 
just been called, and we are trying to calculate based on your 
hard break and Members coming back. We are going to go ahead 
and take another couple of questions before Members have to go, 
and then I am going to talk with the staff.
    I now Recognize Mr. Bucshon for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Bucshon. Thank you.
    Secretary Granholm, thanks for being here. I do want to 
clarify something about you saying that the generals want to do 
that. The generals work for the President of the United States, 
and the ones that don't agree with the President of the United 
States get replaced by people who do agree with the President 
of the United States. So for--the American people should know 
that high-level generals that are running the DoD in an 
administration are people that, in general, politically agree 
with the commander in chief, or they are replaced by someone 
who does.
    So I just think it is really--any time a political party 
says that you--tries to use our military as a reason they are 
doing something and--like it is their expertise--yes, it is 
their expertise, but they agree--these level people you are 
talking about agree with the commander in chief, or they 
wouldn't be in their job. So it is just--I just--just don't do 
that.
    As I have stated before, I am strongly supportive of an 
all-of-the-above energy approach. Look, we need reliable, 
affordable energy, and we obviously need to decrease our carbon 
emissions. I think that is a goal that we all have. I just 
believe that it should be about emissions, not about source.
    And America's future, you know, we have to have affordable, 
reliable, sustainable energy that is cleaner, no doubt, and 
will require a diverse energy mix.
    Have you been recently in Europe or talked to any of your 
European counterparts in Poland, Germany, Czech Republic, 
anywhere in Eastern Europe?
    And have you--are you aware of what is happening in Eastern 
Europe related to the fact that they have all now recognized 
that it is a bad idea to be dependent on energy sources from 
countries that don't like you?
    Ms. Granholm. Absolutely.
    Mr. Bucshon. Well, then you must have a different 
interpretation of what they have said than I did, because I was 
just there with Chair Rodgers. And, you know, if you go to the 
European Union, they are true believers in global warming, the 
ministers there, I understand that. But when you actually talk 
to the countries who are at risk of losing their national 
security based on energy insecurity, what they told us, they 
are rapidly looking for alternatives to Russian fuel.
    And guess where they are looking in the short term? They 
are going back to coal that they have, or they are reliant--
going to rely on LNG imports from around the world. And it is 
going to, from what they had on their clean energy agenda 
before, set Europe back by a decade or more on that goal, 
because they were short-sighted and didn't take an all-of-the-
above approach.
    And now they have shut down all their nuclear plants and 
they no longer can rely on Russian gas, although there were 
protests in Europe, some people loyal to the Russians, that 
want the European countries to start importing cheap Russian 
gas. This creates an international instability.
    The United States cannot put ourself in a position of being 
reliant on foreign sources of energy while shutting down our 
own energy resources in this country, and that is what this 
administration is doing by all the things they are doing to 
their rush to green, to eliminate fossil fuel in the short run 
and the long run.
    And what we should be doing is focusing on emissions and 
not source. And if we don't do that, we are going to end up 
just like they are over there, scrambling, wondering whether 
they can keep the lights on and the heat on in the winter. It 
is just--it just--when I--these hearings, when I hear my 
colleagues like yourself and on the other side of the aisle 
talk about--this isn't--your plans are not doable. Everybody in 
the--almost everybody we talk to in Europe has now recognized 
that. It is just not doable without considering an all-of-the-
above energy approach, including fossil and nuclear and others.
    And so I just--so the Energy Information Administration--I 
will have one quick question--the way--their modeling doesn't 
work. So what do you plan to do to update the EIA modeling 
capabilities to be sure they can provide policymakers and the 
public accurate information on energy supplies, demand, and 
related issues central to the administration's agenda and our 
policymaking decisions?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, I would disagree that they don't work. 
I mean, they----
    Mr. Bucshon. Well, we have--OK.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Are experts at----
    Mr. Bucshon. OK. So we have had modeling both on climate 
and all kinds of things for decades, right? And they have been 
wrong. All of it has been wrong.
    Ms. Granholm. Well, I don't know that all of it has been 
wrong, but these are----
    Mr. Bucshon. Well, the data shows----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Economists and experts that----
    Mr. Bucshon [continuing]. That they are all wrong.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Know what they are doing in 
terms of modeling, and they use very sophisticated tools----
    Mr. Bucshon. OK.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. To do so.
    Mr. Bucshon. Fair enough. We are going to risk the energy 
future and national security of the United States based on 
computer scientists sitting at a computer, modeling things that 
have been shown not to work.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. I now will go to Ms. 
Kuster for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Kuster. Thank you, and thank you very much, Secretary 
Granholm, for taking the time to testify before this committee. 
Before I dive into questions, I want to thank you for your 
efforts to ensure that the hydropower grant program created in 
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law reflects Congress's intent.
    As you know, section 247, maintaining and enhancing 
hydroelectricity incentive programs, provides grants to 
hydropower owners to make dam safety, grid resiliency, and 
environmental improvements at the facilities. I appreciate your 
willingness to resolve issues around the draft guidance in the 
final version to maximize the benefits from these dollars to 
help preserve the existing hydropower fleet. So thank you for 
that.
    Secretary Granholm, I want to start my questions by talking 
about two things we need to achieve our clean energy goals: new 
clean energy generation and long-duration energy storage.
    One way to build out new, clean electricity generation is 
to retrofit some of our 90,000 dams with hydropower generation. 
According to the DOE's analysis, retrofitting nonpowered dams 
could add 12 gigawatts of reliable, renewable energy to the 
grid, enough electricity to power 12 million homes.
    In addition to building new, clean energy generation, we 
need long-duration energy storage. Pumped storage hydropower is 
a proven, long-duration energy storage technology. There's 
already 23 gigawatts of pumped storage on the grid, and more 
than 100 gigawatts in the pipeline.
    But retrofitting a nonpowered dam with hydropower or 
building a new pump storage facility can be very expensive. The 
Inflation Reduction Act provides a 30 percent investment tax 
credit for the next 10 years to help developers retrofit 
nonpowered dams with hydropower generation and build new pumped 
storage projects.
    Madam Secretary, can you speak to how repealing the tax 
credits in the Inflation Reduction Act would impact the 
domestic hydropower and pumped storage industries?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, it would be devastating for the 
industry. I mean, we are just at a point now where we are 
starting to get the investment decisions to be able to add 
capacity at dams. And we--this is clean, dispatchable baseload 
power that could--has blackstart capability. It is 93 percent 
of our pumps--pump storage is 93 percent of our storage, 
utility-scale storage. We absolutely have to accelerate the use 
of hydroelectric power.
    Ms. Kuster. Great. Thank you so much. Rather than spending 
our time rolling back tax credits for hydropower and pump 
storage, I think we should focus on improving the licensing 
process for hydropower facilities. According to analysis by 
NREL, on average it can take between 7 to 10 years to relicense 
a hydropower facility. Licensing pumped storage can take even 
longer.
    Madam Secretary, as Congress considers permitting reform 
legislation, should we also evaluate ways we can improve the 
licensing process for hydropower and pumped storage facilities?
    Ms. Granholm. Absolutely.
    Ms. Kuster. Final question. I was proud to see that Mascoma 
Valley Regional School in my district won an energy class prize 
to lower energy costs and improve indoor air quality. How can 
Congress best support the Department of Energy's work to foster 
healthier learning environments in our schools?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, one of the things you have done is to 
give the Department of Energy the ability to incentivize more 
energy-efficient work at schools, at public schools all across 
the country. We have a funding opportunity announcement out, a 
huge response to it. I would love to see more of that so more 
schools can benefit.
    Ms. Kuster. Great. And next time you are in New Hampshire, 
I invite you to come see the impact of that award on Mascoma 
Valley Regional School.
    And with that, Mr. Chair, I yield back with 1 minute to 
spare.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentlelady for yielding back, and 
we will go to Mrs. Lesko from Arizona for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Lesko. Thank you, Secretary Granholm, for coming here 
today.
    I have seen one analysis that shows that DOE will spend at 
least $150 billion over the next 5 years, maybe significantly 
more. In your budget request you use the term ``equity'' 137 
times. President Biden issued an Executive order directing the 
Federal Government to spend money that is ``consistent with 
applicable law to allocate resources to address the historic 
failure to invest sufficiently, justly, and equally in 
underserved communities.''
    You have been directed to spend $150 billion by Congress. 
Will you provide to this committee the specific applicable law 
passed by Congress that allows these dollars to be spent in a 
manner to address the historic failure to invest sufficiently, 
justly, and equally in underserved communities?
    Ms. Granholm. One of the laws is through the Inflation 
Reduction Act. There is a low-income adder that allows for--it 
is an additional incentive, a 10 percent incentive for those 
who are building out solar, for example, facilities to locate 
in communities that have been disproportionately affected, 
perhaps by--negatively by pollution, or have been a 
disadvantaged community economically.
    Mrs. Lesko. DOE's Justice40 Initiative requires 40 percent 
of spending to go towards disadvantaged communities. Can you 
provide me with a specific applicable law passed by Congress 
that allows such a massive quota system?
    Ms. Granholm. It is a goal. It is Justice40, that 40 
percent should be directed to communities that have been left 
behind, that have not had the benefit of the investments that 
other communities have. So we are trying to achieve that goal, 
and part of that is through Community Benefit Agreements 
associated with the grants that we are providing under the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. We want those who are investing 
to be able to consult with communities to make sure that there 
is a workforce strategy----
    Mrs. Lesko. So you say it is in the infrastructure law?
    Ms. Granholm. Infrastructure law and the Inflation----
    Mrs. Lesko. The language.
    Ms. Granholm. [continuing]. Reduction Act both provide 
incentives for locating facilities in disadvantaged 
communities.
    Mrs. Lesko. Thank you. Madam Secretary, you, I think, 
already know that I am sponsoring a bill, Save Our Stoves--Gas 
Stoves Act. So far we have 55 cosponsors, and it has bipartisan 
support, and 29 of my Democratic colleagues voted for a similar 
amendment--in fact, it was the same language--on H.R. 1 to save 
our gas stoves.
    I wrote a letter with 70 other Members and submitted our 
comments for the record on your rulemaking that would ban gas 
stoves in--effectively ban gas stoves in America.
    I think it is unfortunate that we have to introduce a bill 
to reverse an unnecessary anticonsumer choice rule by the 
Department of Energy. On DOE's website it states claims that 
the Federal Government is banning gas stoves are absurd, yet 
here are the facts that I know.
    DOE's first approach was to set a requirement of the 
proposed rule--max tech requirements which DOE itself said 
would eliminate 96 percent of the products available today. 
Setting a max tech requirement has never been done before for 
household appliances. After pushback, it appears that DOE 
revised their information and subsequently determined half of 
the products would be eliminated from the market.
    It appears DOE pulled this number, quite frankly, out of 
thin air. I don't know where you got it from. They used--they 
started counting products on a website that looked like 
products it tested. DOE, of course, has no actual basis for 
knowing if the products it found meet its proposed standard, 
because it did not test them.
    To date, DOE provides no data or substantiation for how it 
determined the models on retailer websites would meet its 
proposed standards. This proposed rule puts at risk at least 
1,000 manufacturing jobs in just one company in Arizona. And 
quite frankly, it eliminates consumer choice.
    According to DOE's own estimate, the rule will save only 
$21.89 per stove over a 14-year period, or $1.50 per year, or 
12 cents a month. And then DOE said somehow that equates to a 
saving of $1.7 billion.
    Finally, the projected gas emissions reduction is 
equivalent to about 8 hours of Chinese coal plant emissions.
    And so my statement is, why in the world would we want to 
increase funding for the Department of Energy, when it appears 
that they are going after consumer choice and, quite frankly, 
Americans?
    Thank you, and I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady yields back. I go to Ms. Schrier 
for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Schrier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And welcome back, Madam Secretary. Thank you for your 
service. There are a few topics I would like to touch on today, 
but I also want to make sure I give you an opportunity to set 
the record straight on anything you feel like you haven't had 
an opportunity to be clear about. The topics I wanted to touch 
on are small modular nuclear reactors, hydrogen hubs, and 
Hanford. And I will try to be brief, so you have an 
opportunity.
    There is consensus in this committee that nuclear energy is 
a big part of the solution if we want to curb greenhouse gas 
emissions and have a clean energy portfolio. And I was really 
pleased to see additional funding announced this week to help 
with the deployment of small modular nuclear reactors.
    Pacific Northwest National Lab also suggests that this is 
incredibly important that we have them factory fabricated, 
delivered on trucks, affordable. And I just wanted you to 
comment on how do we make this happen in the timeframe that we 
need it to happen in.
    Ms. Granholm. First of all, super important that we 
continue the research and development on these advanced 
reactors, super important that we continue to get them licensed 
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. So we have a--we have a 
process issue that we want to continue to accelerate and 
continue to do the research.
    It also is very important that we have the fuel for these 
small modular reactors, and that means NALEU, and that means we 
have to have a national strategy on--uranium strategy for both 
our larger nuclear fleet, as well as these advanced reactors. 
That is something I hope I can work with you and the committee 
on.
    Ms. Schrier. Thank you. I really appreciate that. And I 
know that Canada can be a significant source for us, a 
friendly, next-door-neighbor nation. But I also saw that there 
was investment in looking for alternative fuels. And so I 
appreciate those investments.
    On that topic, in kind of that same vein, alternative fuels 
to--or materials to use in batteries, in addition to lithium, 
do you have any comments on that?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, oh, we are--the labs are all working on 
substitutes. Not--I mean lithium, but also substitutes for some 
of the other materials that are critical minerals that we may 
rely upon other nations for.
    So that--I was mentioning earlier that manganese is 
something that we are researching. Our Critical Minerals 
Institute at our Ames laboratory is looking at a whole slew of 
potential substitutes as well as getting critical minerals from 
tailings of coal from coal separation, from uranium. We want to 
make sure that we are looking at all potential sources, and I 
would say including recycling of batteries that currently 
exist, because that is a circular economy solution that is very 
promising.
    Ms. Schrier. Thank you. We had a hearing in here with 
companies who are ready to do that recycling.
    Second, I wanted to put in just another plug for Washington 
State as a possible hub for green hydrogen. We have abundant 
hydropower. We also have solar and wind. And ultimately, green 
hydrogen is our ultimate goal, far better than blue or gray, 
because of zero fossil fuel, zero greenhouse gas emissions.
    And lastly, I just wanted to thank you for your commitment 
for work at Hanford and working with our State and--to achieve 
our goals and the administration's goals. And I appreciate your 
help.
    Your--the floor is yours. You have a minute and a half to 
set the record straight. Anything you would like.
    Ms. Granholm. You know what? I don't know that it is 
necessary.
    I will say that the Department of Energy is not banning any 
gas stoves, that we are doing our duty to make sure that 
appliances are more energy efficient, as we are required to do 
under the Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975. We regulate 
and add efficiency standards to 60 appliances. This is one. It 
was required by a consent decree, and nobody is taking my gas 
stove, nobody will take your gas stove. But in the future, gas 
stoves that are high end, which is all that we looked at--the 
high-end gas stoves can be more efficient, and the cost for 
making a high-end gas stove efficient is about $12.
    Ms. Schrier. Sounds like a great investment with a good 
payoff.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. She yields back. I will go to Mr. Balderson 
from Ohio for 5 minutes, and this is going to be the last one, 
and then we are going to break for votes and come back 
immediately after.
    Mr. Balderson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Ms. Secretary, thank you for being here. Nice to meet you.
    Last year, the Senate Democrats unveiled electric 
transmission permitting reform provisions that were included in 
a broader permitting bill. This transmission provision included 
language to socialize the cost of new projects and give FERC 
enhanced transmission siting and permitting authority. The same 
language was just introduced the other week in the Senate.
    Regarding the electric transmission siting and permitting, 
you recently stated, ``Community input is important in all of 
this. We have to be very intentional about that. And we have 
got a team that is focused on that, as well.'' Do you believe 
granting FERC more authority to unilaterally site and permit 
electric transmission lines is consistent with the principle of 
community input, as you previously have stated?
    Ms. Granholm. Are you talking about the backstop authority?
    Mr. Balderson. Yes.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, I do, because I think you can do both. 
You can have FERC issue the backstop authority, but you do it 
in a sensitive way.
    Mr. Balderson. OK.
    Ms. Granholm. Including in community.
    Mr. Balderson. Is granting FERC more authority to impose 
cost socialization of new transmission infrastructure to those 
who do not directly benefit from increased reliability or lower 
costs consistent with the principle of community input?
    Ms. Granholm. I think communities need transmission. And 
the fact that the interconnection queues are completely backed 
up and that we need to have a cost allocation strategy that is 
fair is very important.
    Mr. Balderson. OK, thank you. My next question is I 
understand that nine Federal agencies, including the Department 
of Energy, have signed an MOU on facilitating Federal 
authorizations for electric transmission facilities. This MOU 
states there is a strong public interest in increasing 
coordination across Federal agencies to expand our Nation's 
electric transmission infrastructure.
    I am curious why there is such strong interest in 
increasing coordination, reducing bureaucracy, and moving 
forward with these projects but not doing the same when it 
comes to interstate pipelines or nuclear energy projects, which 
are more essential for grid reliability and for America to meet 
our energy needs.
    Has the Department of Energy signed a similar MOU for 
coordination on pipeline or nuclear energy projects with other 
Federal agencies?
    Ms. Granholm. No.
    Mr. Balderson. Why?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, the grid and the transmission grid has 
been utterly and ridiculously lengthy. It is true that it is--
takes a long time for these others to get permitted, as well. 
We are very much in favor of ensuring that we have, as I was 
discussing earlier, pipelines for a variety of things, 
including CO<INF>2</INF> as well as hydrogen. We also want to 
see expedited movement on nuclear, especially these small 
modular reactors and the microreactors that could be used to 
decarbonize heavy industry.
    Mr. Balderson. OK. Secretary, in your testimony you note 
that the administration supports the use of the Defense 
Production Act to support rebuilding domestic uranium 
production as well as other clean energy technologies to ensure 
robust supply chains for electrical transformers and other 
critical grid components.
    The Inflation Reduction Act provided significant funding to 
carry out the Defense Production Act with almost no strings 
attached. The administration decided to give your Department 
250 million of these--million dollars of these funds to 
accelerate electric heat pump manufacturing. If the 
administration supports using the Defense Production Act to 
rebuild uranium production and improve supply chains for 
electrical transformers and critical grid components, why did 
President Biden choose to use the DPA funds for your Department 
entirely on electric heat pumps?
    Ms. Granholm. I would say that, if we do a uranium 
strategy, it is going to require a good deal amount more than 
that, and then even the 700 million that we initially got under 
the Defense Production Act. We need a comprehensive strategy, 
and I hope we can work with you on it.
    Mr. Balderson. OK. My last thing is kind of a statement, 
but I am going to run out of time. I want to discuss it is part 
of this--the goals and the replace the electrical steel piece 
of the transformers. So I will send this question in to you, 
because I don't want to go over my time.
    So I appreciate you being here, and we will get that over 
to you. Thank you.
    Mr. Duncan. All right. The committee will stand in recess, 
and we will reconvene immediately following the last vote.
    [Recess.]
    Mr. Duncan. The subcommittee will be back in order, and I 
will now recognize Mr. Walberg from Michigan for 5 minutes.
    And thank you for your patience, Madam Secretary.
    Mr. Walberg. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Michiganians and Michiganders are very patient people. We 
share that, don't we, Madam Secretary?
    Ms. Granholm. Absolutely.
    Mr. Walberg. Yes. Well, thank you for being here, and you 
and I agree on some things and we don't agree on other things, 
but that is the way it goes.
    I have been listening throughout the hearing thus far, and 
one thing that just became at least clear to me was that with 
IRA and IIJA, and all of the forward good thoughts about what 
this can produce, that is still in the expectation realm.
    You know, I look back at what we did in the last 
administration. There is a case history of energy independence, 
lowered emissions--which I think we agree on, we want to lower 
the emissions--and lower prices at the pump and otherwise. And 
so that is, I think, where the concern comes when we see some 
of the projected savings, experiences. We know what worked, and 
a concern about what we are--going forward.
    So with the recent EPA emission rules, over two-thirds of 
the new vehicles have to be all electric in less than 10 years. 
I know you have said in the past that the rules don't specify 
what type of vehicle technology, and we hope there is 
flexibility that remains there. But the OEMs who have been 
unwilling to stand up and say, ``We can't do this''--and I have 
jumped on them plenty, Ford and GM and Stellantis most 
recently, and I have lauded Toyota for being willing to look at 
some alternatives--I worry, with the massive increase in EVs in 
addition to other forced electrification coming out of your 
agency and the EPA, our electric grid will not be able to keep 
up. I think I can say it won't be able to keep up right now.
    In going about my new district that goes from Lake Michigan 
and the Cook Nuclear plant and the mothballing of the Palisades 
plant that is taking place now, all the way over to Lake Erie 
with Fermi I and II, and Fermi that has a third license that 
they spent millions of dollars to get, but they have told me 
because of permitting, because of cost they are probably not 
going to do that. So I look at nuclear capabilities, and 
there's concerns there.
    This also comes with the new regulations coming out of the 
administration last night talking about emissions being cut by 
90 percent, or close to that. Today I heard from a constituent 
company who said they were prepared to put four EV chargers at 
their filling station convenience store, but the local utility 
ultimately came in and said, ``You can't do it. We can only 
give you one, because we don't have capacity.''
    And I could go down the list, and you have heard the same 
concerns.
    I heard something new today, that a similar company--
relative to transporting fossil fuels, oil, specifically 
gasoline, to areas where they have had disaster, hurricane or 
whatever--FEMA has expressed concerns on meeting emergency 
needs without fossil fuel capacities and capabilities, because 
you can't carry a 20-gallon drum of electricity, and even 
getting the trucks there.
    So those are, I guess, preface to my concern about how is 
the Department of Energy planning to offset both this increase 
in demand and decrease in supply being forced by administration 
policies?
    Ms. Granholm. Thank you.
    First, this is a--and it must be--a managed and thoughtful 
transition. And it is why these are all proposed rules, and we 
want to hear from industry so that we get it right and that we 
don't end up creating insecurity on the grid. Super important.
    I will say that, for example in Michigan, the Palisades 
plant, there is hopefully an effort to try to revive that. That 
will be coming through our--I think--our Loan Program Office. 
So we are hopeful that that will not reduce supply. And we need 
more nuclear online. This--what you have just described with 
Fermi is new to me, so I am going to dig into that a little 
bit.
    However, I will say this too: One of the things we have not 
discussed here, and I think that is important, is the 
electrification of the vehicle fleet is also an opportunity to 
have virtual power plants to allow for the batteries. This is 
why all of the OEMs care about bidirectional charging to have 
the batteries of those vehicles end up having a conversation 
with the grid when times are tight.
    Mr. Walberg. But that----
    Ms. Granholm. And that is an opportunity.
    Mr. Walberg. That is a hope for the future. And right now 
they are making their assumptions, they are making their plans 
based upon what we are talking about, and that is why, Madam 
Secretary, I think we ought to be cautious. We ought to talk 
with great flexibility before we start putting percentages and 
timeframes on.
    I think we are capable through innovation. We have shown 
that. We have cleaned up our environment to a great degree, 
better than any other country in the world with natural gas.
    So I have run over my time. And so I must say also, let's--
any help you can give us on Line 5? You knew I would bring that 
up.
    Ms. Granholm. I knew you had to.
    Mr. Walberg. We have to have help.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time has expired.
    Mr. Walberg. Thank you.
    Mr. Duncan. I will now go to Mr. Cardenas for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you, Secretary Granholm, for being here with us 
today, and for serving our country so well. Thank you so much 
for your service.
    Last Congress the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
and the Inflation Reduction Act authorized the programs and 
funding necessary to meaningfully address the climate crisis. 
These two complementary laws have already accelerated our 
Nation's transition to a clean energy economy powered by 
American workers, manufacturers, and innovators. We are now 
beginning to see the impacts of these bills and job creation, 
clean power, and cost savings for families.
    Unfortunately, some of my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are taking steps to undo the strides Democrats made 
in lowering energy costs for American families, undoing our 
Nation's legacy of environmental injustice, and transitioning 
our Nation to a clean energy economy. That includes pushing the 
Default on America Act, which would repeal environmental review 
processes and keep provisions from the Inflation Reduction Act.
    Republicans have chosen a path that would further line the 
pockets of Big Oil as they continue to push their polluter--the 
polluters-over-people agenda. As we look to deliver the 
America--for the American people, we must preserve these 
victories for our economy, workforce, environment, and our 
children, and children's future.
    As we know, the budget is a reflection of our values, and I 
am heartened to see that the Department of Energy is looking to 
build off the major accomplishments of the last Congress. To 
deliver on climate action equitably, the Inflation Reduction 
Act advances the Justice40 Initiative, which sets to deliver 40 
percent of investments to disadvantaged communities that have 
been hurt by polluters for generations.
    Secretary Granholm, what is the Department doing to advance 
Justice40?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, thanks for asking that question. It is--
as you know, it is the first Executive order that the President 
signed, and it is part of this administration's DNA across 
agencies.
    For us, for example, what it means is that when we are 
offering a grant program--say, the hydrogen hubs as an 
example--that those who are coming to seek the grant have to 
demonstrate that they have a Community Benefits Agreement, that 
the community is at the table and helping to craft it so that 
they get the benefit of the good instead of, obviously, being 
the victims of the bad, which has been the case.
    The combination of the Community Benefits Agreement and the 
incentives that are embedded in the IIJA to incentivize the 
location of good projects in communities that have been 
disadvantaged is a really strong one-two punch to ensure that 
the community--the communities are at the table.
    Mr. Cardenas. So the administration is looking to do this 
in a way that creates more equitable and accessible future for 
all communities?
    Ms. Granholm. Absolutely.
    Mr. Cardenas. OK, thank you. Speaking of communities, I 
happen to have been elected to represent the community that I 
grew up in, the side of town where we have more dump sites in 
LA County than any other place in the 10-million-person County 
of Los Angeles. I was the first one to represent that 
community.
    I am very proud to say that I was the first elected 
official to say no to a landfill expansion, that the first 
permit said that they are going to put trash in the ground, 
very deeply into the ground, up to grade. And by the time I got 
elected, they had so many permits that they were above 100 feet 
above the ground. The children in the community called it a 
mountain. It was just a mountain of trash that came from all 
parts of Los Angeles but was dumped on our side of town. So we 
cannot do all the wonderful work that you are getting done soon 
enough for communities like the one that I grew up in, and that 
I am so blessed to represent.
    The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the 
Inflation Reduction Act prioritize building out our Nation's 
workforce by creating good-paying union jobs. This has also 
been under attack. Most recently in H.R. 1, the Republicans 
sought to repeal home energy efficiency contractor training 
grants that we had included in the Inflation Reduction Act. 
However, to strengthen our Nation's economy and transition into 
clean energy, it is vital that we build our Nation's workforce, 
and we must do so in a way that prioritizes diversity and good-
paying jobs that families can sustain themselves on.
    Secretary Granholm, what steps in the Department--is the 
Department taking to increase workforce training opportunities 
for communities of color, low-income communities, and 
nontraditional students?
    Ms. Granholm. We are doing a bunch of things, but I--let me 
just specify one that is really important, which is these 
Community Benefit Agreements that I am talking about. They are 
weighted in the evaluation of the proposal 20 percent that has 
to demonstrate that the communities there--and part of that 
includes workforce training for the specific project that may 
be coming to that area, number one.
    And number two, ensuring that there are apprenticeship 
opportunities for those so they can earn while they learn, so 
that we can have the next generation, as well, building out, 
whether it is trades or the specialized kind of work that is 
necessary in these advanced energy projects. So we are excited 
about being able to bring everybody along.
    Mr. Cardenas. I exceeded my time. I apologize, Mr. 
Chairman, and I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. The Chair will now 
go to the vice chair of the subcommittee, Mr. Curtis, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Curtis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Madam Secretary, my compliments for being here. My--also my 
compliments for your interaction with me and our caucus. I 
think the first step to overcoming differences is communication 
and working together. And I am one who really appreciates your 
efforts to reach out to us.
    I also advocate frequently that we actually agree on far 
more than it sometimes sounds like between different parties 
here. One of those vast areas, I think, of agreement is 
nuclear, and we have had that quite a bit discussed today, but 
I would like to discuss a specific project.
    Thank you for DOE's historic commitment to the Carbon Free 
Power Project. I have an organization, UAMPS. It actually is 
Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems--I had to look it up 
myself, because we all know it is UAMPS--who is 10 years 
through a permitting process, about halfway through and $100 
million into it, couldn't do it without the help of DOE. And 
this is a big load on municipalities to finance this, and so I 
am grateful for your support. This is a big deal, if we are 
able to complete this project.
    And that said, I am a little concerned about the overall 
amount of money towards advanced small nuclear reactors and 
wanted to kind of hear from you DOE's position and commitment 
to these small nuclear reactors, which, clearly, I think by 
everybody's standards, needs to be part of our energy future.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, I couldn't agree more that it absolutely 
does. I know the--we have a $10 million in there for the UAMPS 
program, and I know it has been given hundreds of millions over 
the past years, but we are totally committed to small modular 
reactors, advanced reactors, and the technologies that are 
going to not just help the United States, but around the world. 
We know that we have got allies in countries like in Eastern 
Europe, et cetera, that are very interested in these 
technologies, and we want to develop them here. We want to have 
them made in America, but we also want to be able to export 
them.
    Mr. Curtis. Clearly, we should all agree on the fact that 
we want it made here, in America, right?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Mr. Curtis. And exported----
    Ms. Granholm. Here, another point of 100 percent agreement.
    Mr. Curtis. Yes, another point of agreement, right, that we 
all agree on.
    So--and it has been brought up today, but let me just touch 
on Russia being an available source for advanced nuclear fuel. 
It feels to me like, on one hand, we are trying to get 
permitting reform in place so we can build all these nuclear 
facilities. And yet, if we do that, we may not have the fuel.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Mr. Curtis. Can you address that, and----
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, this is one of the things that I think 
we have to work on in a bipartisan fashion, is a uranium 
strategy. What we have developed is a proposal for a $2.1 
billion uranium strategy that would allow for a revolving fund 
so that we could finance the conversion enrichment, et cetera, 
all the steps, here in the United States.
    We are hopeful--we got 700 million as a downpayment of 
that, but we are hopeful to be able to work with Congress to 
fully fund that, perhaps in NDAA or in a supplemental or 
whatever, because I think it is really important that we do 
that if we are to become--to wean ourselves from reliance upon 
Russian uranium.
    Mr. Curtis. Yes. I--so we are building this facility, and--
well, we have the HALEU, right, in place----
    Ms. Granholm. Right, right.
    Mr. Curtis [continuing]. When this is done, I think----
    Ms. Granholm. Well, as you----
    Mr. Curtis. And I don't know if you have any specific 
comments on----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Are probably aware, we are, at H 
Canyon, using--we are down-blending highly enriched uranium to 
get HALEU for the advanced reactors that we have. But it is not 
going to last long enough. We need a long-term strategy.
    Mr. Curtis. So thank you. I would like to turn to maybe an 
area where there is not as much agreement, but still vast 
agreement.
    I heard my colleague Mr. Walberg talk about EVs. And I 
think sometimes when as Republicans we ask questions, we are 
viewed as not supporting or not wanting solar or wind or EVs 
and things like that. And I don't think it is the case, but I 
do think we have questions, right, and we want answers.
    I happened to read a Wall Street Journal article today that 
pointed out that Rivian Automotive is going to lose, this 
quarter, $75,000 on every vehicle sold. And the value of their 
company is based--is given $98,000 for every car it expects to 
sell. But Lotus--Lucid, excuse me, their value of the company 
is 1.2 million for every car that they expect to sell.
    So sometimes, you see, when we hear these things, this is 
why we bring up questions. And sometimes I think it is 
perceived as, well, we just don't want EVs. But I think--I 
would just really like to point out there is a practical part 
of this that we want answers.
    How are we going to charge these? Where is the grid going 
to come from? Where is the electricity going to come from? And 
this isn't even speaking to the $7,500 credit.
    So I don't know if you have a comment on that. It was just 
a point I wanted to make.
    Ms. Granholm. Well, I would say that this is why we have 
these 17 jewels, which are the national labs that are expert at 
modeling all of these different scenarios. And you are right to 
ask the questions, and it is important to ask the questions, 
and it is important to get the right answers from those who 
have expertise.
    Mr. Curtis. Thank you.
    Ms. Granholm. And so----
    Mr. Curtis. Madam, I am out of time.
    Mr. Chair, I would like to ask unanimous consent to submit 
for the record ``EV Startups Are Proving Warren Buffett 
Right,'' Wall Street Journal today.
    Mr. Duncan. Without objection, so ordered.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr. Duncan. And the Chair will now go to Mr. Sarbanes.
    Mr. Curtis. Thank you.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman.
    And Secretary Granholm, welcome.
    Ms. Granholm. Thank you.
    Mr. Sarbanes. You are definitely in the eye of the energy 
transition storm, but doing a terrific job in managing that 
transition on behalf of our Government. So thanks so much.
    It is so vital that we stay at the forefront of the 
evolving energy industry in developing clean energy technology 
and the workforce. Critically, to implement it is going to spur 
tremendous economic growth, as you know, while also promoting 
our environmental and our national security interests.
    But we know that those interests are impacted by the much 
larger global marketplace, of course. And for more than a year 
now we have witnessed an upheaval in global energy security in 
the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Despite these 
challenges, many of our European allies have stepped up to the 
plate to reduce dependance on Russian energy sources. Could you 
describe some of the recent steps that DOE has taken to bolster 
European energy security in partnership with our allies?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, for sure.
    Number one, we have obviously done a lot of exporting of 
liquefied natural gas, which has been, I think, a great save to 
many of them.
    We have partnered with them on developing strategies for 
hydrogen and to systematize the standards related to it so that 
there can be international trade of clean hydrogen.
    We have worked with them on--especially the Eastern 
Europeans--on advanced nuclear and have partnered with them on, 
for example, Westinghouse going to Poland to be able to build 
several of their reactors going forward, all of their focus on 
diversifying energy supply.
    We have been in tandem with them, both on the technology 
side as well as on the deployment to the extent that we can.
    I will say we have learned from them, too, offshore wind 
efforts that have--that the UK and the Northern Europeans have 
engaged in, and have been very instructive for us as we 
consider our own offshore wind strategy. So it has been a 
mutual arrangement.
    Mr. Sarbanes. And on that score, in Maryland we have got 
some really exciting developments in terms of offshore wind 
production with some of those international partners being in 
the mix.
    We have eastern Mediterranean allies like Greece and Cyprus 
and Israel, who are playing a very critical role in these 
efforts, the ones that we are discussing, as you know, and 
Congress recognized this when it passed the bipartisan Eastern 
Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Act a few years 
back. And in that we authorized the establishment of the United 
States Eastern Mediterranean Energy Center.
    The Center's goal will be to leverage ``the experience, 
knowledge, and expertise of institutions of higher education 
and entities in the private sector, among others, to identify 
opportunities for energy development in the region.'' 
Establishing the U.S. Eastern Mediterranean Energy Center will 
both facilitate the development of cutting-edge clean-energy 
solutions and promote Europe's energy diversification in 
accordance with our economic and national security interests.
    Could you maybe just comment on why establishing the U.S. 
Mediterranean Center is so important for international energy 
policy, and what resources you think might be necessary to get 
that center off the ground?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, thanks for that too. I think that across 
the Mediterranean there is so much happening, and so important 
to solidify the relationships, especially around energy because 
of its critical nexus, where it is in the world, and the desire 
to wean ourselves from energy from Russia. That particular 
center, the concept of a center, is super important.
    I know that there has--we have been authorized to be able 
to establish it, and looking forward to an appropriation. And I 
know there has been a suggestion about a $10 million----
    Mr. Sarbanes. Yes.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Appropriation. Our International 
Affairs Office is in the middle of drafting a concept paper of 
what this would look like. But the bottom line is the various 
points of energy, whether it is wind or offshore wind or clean 
hydrogen transported via ship or solar, obviously, or advanced 
small reactors, you name it, that region is a fundamental part 
of our ability to partner with Europe to become energy 
independent.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Great, and we look forward to working with 
you on that. We are seeking the appropriations.
    I have got 30 seconds left. So just on another topic real 
quick, a lot of focus on sort of technology as a way of 
sequestering carbon, but can you speak to your perspective on 
making sure we have a good balance of sort of biological 
solutions in terms of dealing with climate change alongside of 
technological solutions?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, we have to do biological solutions. We 
have to do Earth-based solutions. We have to do technological 
solutions. We have to do everything, everywhere, all at once.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Great, thanks very much. I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. OK. The Chair will go to Mr. Palmer from 
Alabama for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    First of all, Secretary Granholm, I am very encouraged by 
your support for next-generation nuclear. I think it is our 
best option, best opportunity for transitioning to an 
emissions-free--well, it won't be emissions-free because 
there's emissions involved in the construction, but there are a 
number of reasons why I think this is the direction we ought to 
go.
    One, we can recycle spent fuel rods. France is doing that. 
They use a standard design on their nuclear reactors, which I 
think helps reduce the cost of the reactors themselves, reduces 
maintenance costs, but they operate 24/7, where with wind and 
solar it is intermittent power. And I worked for two 
international engineering companies prior to running a think 
tank for 20-something years. And our--we cannot have the 
economic growth that we want to have, we cannot be able to 
support the emergence of economies in poor countries with just 
trying to rely on intermittent power.
    And as I was saying, what the nuclear facilities will do 
for us is 24/7 power generation, except when you shut them down 
for maintenance. Their operational life cycle will be 
approximately 80 years, which--Lord knows where we will be with 
technology in 80 years.
    But the other thing that I think we need to take note of is 
that you can cite one next-generation nuclear facility on 640 
acres. It is about the same amount of space you would use for a 
natural gas facility. But to generate the same amount of power 
from that nuclear facility from a turbine farm would require 
77,000 acres. And I think you understand the problems we are 
running into with Not In My Backyard, with potentially a very 
aggressive use of eminent domain, which I really don't think we 
want to go that direction.
    So my other concern is--about this, and you can address 
this, is there really isn't a scenario where we are going to be 
net zero by 2050. The physics don't work, the economics don't 
work, and the technology doesn't work. Now, that is not to say 
in the next 20 or so years that the technology won't improve, 
but there really isn't a way to get there. So it is encouraging 
to me to see the emphasis on next-generation nuclear, and 
particularly since we can recycle spent fuel rods.
    The Director of the National Nuclear Laboratory was here 
the week before last, I think it was, Mr. Chairman, and I asked 
him if he had done any calculations to determine how long we 
could operate these nuclear reactors using the fuel that is 
stored now, and he said 100 years. So we don't have to depend 
on anybody.
    The other thing that I want to address is my concern. I 
know my Democrat colleagues are very dismissive of what we are 
trying to do with H.R. 1. They are very dismissive of some of 
the issues that we have brought up about China. I do not 
believe the existential threat to the world is climate change. 
I think it is China. And in that regard, I am very concerned 
about how much we will be dependent on China for our energy 
resources.
    And I have said this many, many times, that the war in 
Ukraine did not create the energy crisis, it exposed it. It 
exposed the fact that we have spent a decade and a half 
neglecting our hydrocarbon infrastructure, particularly natural 
gas. But it is also instructive that no nation should be 
dependent on an adversarial nation for anything as important to 
its economy and its national security as energy. So how would 
you respond to that?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, I couldn't agree more that we should 
not be reliant upon countries whose values we don't share for 
our own energy resources. And that is why the importance of the 
Invest in America agenda, the Inflation Reduction Act has 
caused all of these companies doing critical mineral processing 
and battery supply chain work to come to the United States to 
build up our supply chain here, so that we are energy 
independent.
    I think we could probably all agree that it is important to 
build up our own supply chain so that we are energy 
independent----
    Mr. Palmer. But my point is we don't need to--we don't have 
to do that for nuclear.
    Ms. Granholm. I am agreeing with you on nuclear.
    Mr. Palmer. We have got a major problem with permitting. It 
will take years to get us where we need to be on the critical 
minerals.
    I am not--I am fine with renewables, but there's certain 
physics that come into play here. You cannot sustain the 
economy that we have, much less grow the economy that we need 
to grow, with intermittent power. Europe is starting to wake up 
to this.
    So I think we need an all-of-the--truly, an all-of-the-
above, but we should not cast aside our hydrocarbon resources 
in this mad dash, which I think is rather mad to think that we 
have got to do all this in such a short amount of time, when we 
really don't.
    And Mr. Chairman, I yield back, and I thank you for 
testifying, and for you holding this hearing.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time has expired. I will go to 
Ms. Blunt Rochester for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you, Secretary Granholm, for attending today's 
hearing.
    On behalf of my State and region, I would like to thank you 
and the Department for moving forward with the hydrogen hub 
program, which will help create more jobs and ensure an 
effective transition to clean energy. Last month the Mid-
Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub, also known as MACH2, submitted its 
application to become one of those hubs. And the proposal will 
transform the energy economy of the State of Delaware and spur 
massive job growth for my constituents.
    And I urge you, Madam Secretary, to ensure that small 
States like Delaware are also able to benefit from this 
program.
    I would also like to thank you for your testimony's 
attention to supply chain resiliency. My bill, the Supply 
Chains Act, would help us solve these problems across the 
economy, including the energy sector, and I would love to 
follow up with you in the future to discuss this legislation.
    I am glad to--also to have you here. And I heard the 
conversation with Representative Cardenas about the efforts of 
the administration to focus not only on clean energy jobs, but 
also union jobs, apprenticeships, also the focus on Justice40. 
I can say from my own constituents how grateful they are for 
that work and that attention, that focus.
    And in your testimony you noted that a $70 million 
investment for community capacity building initiatives to 
address areas of persistent poverty. This issue has come up 
repeatedly when I am talking to folks about the implementation 
of major bills like the IRA or the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law. And so can you just speak a little bit about what that 
investment means, what it would do, what--the intention of it? 
I would love to hear more about that, and also how it ties to 
the persistent poverty issue, as well.
    Ms. Granholm. I mean, one of the great things about policy 
mattering is that when you adopt great legislation and craft it 
in the right way, then it can go to the populations that you--
that really need it.
    So I think, as an example of weatherization--you and I were 
at a weatherization event--there has been enhancements to the 
weatherization program that are specific that will impact 
significantly impoverished communities. For example, allowing 
impoverished communities to install not just weatherization, 
but also solar generation, for example, on homes; allowing 
those who live in manufactured housing to take advantage of 
those.
    So the--we have a State and community energy program that 
is now--that is as a result of trying to administer these 
programs where DOE meets the street, if you will, and making 
sure we are thoughtful about crafting our outreach and our 
programs to communities that have been left behind, communities 
that are fenceline communities--has been a big part of our 
efforts in our administration of our Justice40 goals.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. Yes, I really want to zero in, as 
well, on making sure that dollars get to the communities that 
need it most, but also that they have the capacity to do it.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. That is one of the things that I have 
heard most back from constituents is, ``I don't know how to do 
this kind of grant application.''
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. ``I have never done this before.'' And 
so that capacity-building part is really, really vital, I 
think, in this moment.
    Ms. Granholm. And I would say streamlining process, so that 
they don't have to do a huge funding opportunity.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. Exactly.
    Ms. Granholm. Maybe they do a concept paper, maybe you 
reduce the amount of cost share. All of those are what we are 
considering as we administer these grant programs.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. I mean, for me, I think about this 
from a jobs perspective, I think about it from a health 
perspective.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. There are so many pieces to--and then 
there is the justice impact of it, as well.
    So thank you for that. I think we have talked before as 
well about, you know, the efforts to upscale retrofitting, like 
home performance programs, to include large public buildings. 
And I will be reintroducing legislation to help DOE do just 
that. According to the EPA, the building sector accounts for 31 
percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Public buildings such 
as schools and hospitals tend to be the most energy intensive 
because they are larger, older, and usually have higher 
electricity demand.
    And so can you talk a little bit about what you have been 
able to do through the Office of State and Community Energy 
programs at DOE for schools and hospitals----
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester [continuing]. And municipal buildings?
    Ms. Granholm. This is really important, too, the schools 
piece. As an example, there is a funding opportunity 
announcement to be able to allow schools to retrofit for 
weatherization. It was way oversubscribed. The need is 
enormous. And so, to the extent that we can work together, 
Congress can work on upping that so that schools can take 
advantage of this because their heating bills or cooling bills, 
depending, are--eat up a huge amount of budget that they could 
be using for educational resources.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. I have run out of time, but the last 
point I will make is about lowering cost. That is the other big 
point of this is to lower costs for families.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Ms. Blunt Rochester. So thank you so much for your 
testimony, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady's time has expired. I go to Mr. 
Weber for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Weber. Thank you. Secretary Granholm, thank you for 
being here. I echo his comments, John Curtis, about coming to 
the meeting. I was part of that. I sat right beside you, and 
you did a good job. Thanks.
    And actually, I am part of the Science Committee. I know 
the Science Committee has been trying to get you there because 
the Department of Energy's critical R&D programs are about a 
third of the DOE's annual budget. Do you have plans to meet at 
the Science Committee?
    Ms. Granholm. I know that my Under Secretary--didn't they 
testify there yesterday, the two Under Secretaries?
    Mr. Weber. OK, well----
    Ms. Granholm. I know----
    Mr. Weber. I wanted to get that out of the way----
    Ms. Granholm. OK.
    Mr. Weber [continuing]. Because that is important, too.
    Do you have any plans to impose a cap on the total volume 
of U.S. LNG exports?
    Ms. Granholm. I do not. I don't have any plans on doing 
that. We are--we do have a request for information on the 
street about how we should consider all of this, including how 
the exports impact natural gas.
    Mr. Weber. Well, we have 2\1/2\ LNG plants in my district. 
I am the gulf coast of Texas, and we export a lot of it, and we 
got one on the drawing--we got one that is pretty well 
underway, and then one on the drawing board--so four total, I 
guess.
    I think we can send more gas to Europe to help them wean 
off of Russian gas. Obviously, you support LNG exports to 
Europe?
    Ms. Granholm. As you have seen, we have granted export 
licenses to a whole slew. In fact, we have got--for those LNG 
terminals that are under construction--that will be 20 Bcf of 
LNG----
    Mr. Weber. Right.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. To go, which is a huge amount. 
There is another 20 that have been licensed that aren't even 
under construction. So there is a universe of LNG that is 
available for Europe. The question is whether they get a final 
investment decision.
    Mr. Weber. OK. Well, we--yes, that is absolutely right.
    Do you agree with the existing DOE studies that showed the 
net economic benefits of expanded LNG exports? Have you seen 
those studies?
    Ms. Granholm. The--who wrote the study?
    Mr. Weber. The DOE.
    Ms. Granholm. Wait, which--do you know which----
    Mr. Weber. It is the--I don't.
    Ms. Granholm. Is it the FECM, the Fossil Energy and Carbon 
Management?
    Mr. Weber. It may be. You might----
    Ms. Granholm. I have to go back and take a look at----
    Mr. Weber. We will look at that later, then. Any plans to 
revisit those existing studies? I guess you are talking about 
it now, you will go back and look at them.
    Ms. Granholm. Well, we are looking at--I mean, we want to 
look at the impacts, because we are really blessed, as you 
know, with a huge amount of natural gas. And the question is, 
how does--how do exports impact the greenhouse gas emissions? 
How does methane? You know, how do we deal with all of that, 
and what does it do in terms of domestic pricing for natural 
gas?
    So it----
    Mr. Weber. We want to be careful with that. In our rush to 
go green, we want to make sure that we don't do a number on our 
energy industry. So we want to be careful with it.
    Ms. Granholm. I understand.
    Mr. Weber. Do you believe that cooking--the cooking 
products rule is far reaching and deserves a complete 
transparent rulemaking process from the DOE, which would 
include sufficient time for comments?
    Because there's a lot of people in Texas that are going to 
be unhappy if you--if the regulations for gas--I was an air 
conditioning contractor for 35 years. I know what super-high 
efficiency ratings did to the cost of equipment. It was hardest 
on the lowest-income people because they never planned to 
replace their air conditioning, and when the equipment became 
more expensive, it was hard on them.
    But anyway, do you believe the cooking products rule is far 
reaching? And will there be a good comment period on it?
    Ms. Granholm. There is a comment period on it, and we are 
always--in fact, we just extended the comment period for 
another one, because we want to make sure that we get all of 
the feedback necessary before issuing any final rule.
    Mr. Weber. OK, good to hear that. Are you aware that 
households that use natural gas, which--we have a lot of LNG in 
Texas--for heating, cooking, and clothes drying save an average 
of $1,068 per year over electric appliances, $1,068 a year in 
savings--natural gas cooking, heating, clothes drying--over 
electricity.
    Ms. Granholm. And----
    Mr. Weber. That is not a small amount.
    Ms. Granholm. And the electric and the gas furnaces, we 
want--furnaces, excuse me, the gas stoves, we want them to be 
efficient too. And that is what the rule was about, it is about 
creating--but those are for--it was for higher-end gas stoves.
    Mr. Weber. Well, it is a little harder to get efficiency up 
on them as it is furnaces, which wound up with a 90 percent 
AFUE rating. So I was very familiar with the SEER ratings and 
what the----
    Ms. Granholm. Sure.
    Mr. Weber. I sold my company 5 years ago. It is hard on 
people. The more expensive the appliances and stuff are, the 
more it hurts those who can least afford it.
    Well, I have got about 49 seconds. So are you aware that 
switching from gas to electricity costs thousands of dollars in 
a home? When we went into a house, if they had an electric 
furnace and they wanted to go gas, then you are talking about a 
gas company, you are talking about a plumber, you are talking 
about a gas meter, you are talking about a lot more labor. You 
know that that is pretty expensive, right?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, I would say that, with the incentives 
that are about heat pumps, for example, to reduce the cost, 
the--what we have seen in the modeling is that, in fact, it 
reduces on average cost----
    Mr. Weber. Well, I will tell you that heat pumps are a lot 
more expensive than regular conventional air conditioners.
    Ms. Granholm. That is what I am saying, is the incentives 
for the heat pumps really bring down the cost. The rebates that 
will be there can reduce by half, in many cases, especially for 
poorer or lower income, it can replace almost the full thing.
    Mr. Weber. But if you are going all electric and you have 
got to go to natural gas, it is expensive.
    I am out of time, and I got a plane to catch. Thank you for 
being here.
    I yield back.
    Ms. Granholm. Very good, thank you.
    Mr. Duncan. Mr. Armstrong is recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Armstrong. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think before I 
start I will just point out that everything is cheaper if it 
has a rebate and incentive, a tax break or a subsidy, not just 
green energy. And I will continue to say that when we talk 
about cost competitiveness.
    But the EPA had a rule 2 weeks ago, a proposed rule that is 
going to have two-thirds of all car sales be electric by 2032. 
You spoke earlier about 160 battery companies coming to the 
United States, which I actually think is great, and dealing 
with all of this. But the top five critical minerals in a car 
battery are lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and manganese.
    Lithium: Australia produces 52 percent, Chile produces 25 
percent, China produces 13 percent. But China actually has a 
stranglehold on the lithium supply chain, and they have 
invested $6 billion worth of assets in lithium in Chile, 
Canada, and Australia and currently holds north of 60 percent 
of the refining capacity. There is one mine in the United 
States, and it cannot cover 20 percent of the current EV 
consumption.
    And I agree with the aspirational growth. I--permitting 
reform, if we had DoT or EPA in here, I would be asking about 
transmission infrastructure and how we are actually going to 
charge these cars when they are on the road. I don't. I have 
you in here, Madam Secretary. And so, under current--under the 
current construction and regulatory construct, how much lithium 
are we going to mine in the United States in 2032?
    Ms. Granholm. I don't know by 2032. But I do know that 
there is a huge amount of lithium resources in the United 
States that----
    Mr. Armstrong. There is a ton of lithium resources----
    Ms. Granholm. Right.
    Mr. Armstrong [continuing]. In the United States. I don't 
think we will have a lithium mine permitted by----
    Ms. Granholm. Well, that is the whole thing. Let's work 
together on that. Let's work together on reforming the Mining 
Act.
    Mr. Armstrong. Well, except--but that is the whole policy 
point behind this, is--it is like we are blowing up the bridge, 
and then we are going to figure out a way to cross the river.
    Ms. Granholm. But I would imagine----
    Mr. Armstrong. We should have the permitting reform before 
we have the EPA mandate to make two-thirds of all new car sales 
electric by 2032.
    Ms. Granholm. Well, I disagree. I think we can do it if we 
can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to reform the 
Mining Act, for example, and speed up permitting.
    Mr. Armstrong. The top three places in the United States to 
mine cobalt are Congo, Russia, Australia. How much cobalt are 
we going to mine in the United States by 2032?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, we may not. It may be that we have a 
friend, like in Australia or----
    Mr. Armstrong. Yes.
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Like in Canada.
    Mr. Armstrong. When you are looking at the rare earth 
mineral list, we better not anger the Aussies, or we are going 
to be in a real, real difficult problem.
    Nickel: Indonesia, Philippines, Russia, New Caledonia, 
Australia, Canada, China. How much nickel are we going to mine 
in the----
    Ms. Granholm. A number of those----
    Mr. Armstrong [continuing]. United States?
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Are very friendly countries that 
want to have those arrangements. That is why Canada is very 
interested. Australia is very interested. Japan is very 
interested.
    Mr. Armstrong. How much nickel are we going to mine in the 
United States by----
    Ms. Granholm. I hope we mine a good amount by then.
    Mr. Armstrong. Manganese: South Africa, Australia, China, 
Gabon, Brazil. How much manganese are we going to mine in the 
United States?
    Ms. Granholm. I hope we do what we need, and we onshore the 
rest.
    Mr. Armstrong. Graphite: China, Madagascar, Mozambique, 
Brazil, South Korea, Russia, Canada. How much graphite are we 
going to mine in the United States?
    Ms. Granholm. Same answer.
    Mr. Armstrong. Hope is not a policy.
    I want to just talk a little bit about the Northeast 
Gasoline Supply Reserve, which was established in 2014 to 
address supply issues following Hurricane Sandy. The budget 
requests an 8 percent increase to support a 1 million barrel 
reserve. Do you know approximately how many days the northeast 
gas life consumption the reserve would support?
    Ms. Granholm. It is not very much.
    Mr. Armstrong. It is like one day, I think, isn't it?
    Ms. Granholm. It is a small amount.
    Mr. Armstrong. The gasoline reserves are commingled in 
tanks with commercial supplies costing about $13 per barrel a 
year to maintain. If a storm disrupts the supply at commercial 
Raritan Bay facility, the DOE reserves would almost certainly 
face disruption because the gasoline is commingled. Doesn't 
this place the reserve at the same level of risk as the 
commercial supply they are meant to supplement?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, I would say this, that it is important 
for that area to feel like they have a bit of an insurance 
policy, given that it is an area that often is difficult to get 
supply to. So it is important for them, and that is one of the 
reasons why it exists.
    Mr. Armstrong. But citing previous operational concerns, 
the Department of Energy officials told GAO in 2022 that the 
current administration was considering its position on whether 
to continue our recommended closing the gasoline product 
reserve. Has the administration determined its position on the 
gasoline reserve?
    Ms. Granholm. I think they are going to keep it open.
    Mr. Armstrong. Between the limited scale, commingled 
supplies, and excessive cost per barrel, the Northeast Gasoline 
Supply Reserve merits significant review. I mean, we have to 
figure it out.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Mr. Armstrong. The very disruptions we are trying to 
protect are going to have the same problems for our actual 
reserve.
    And then I would just comment, instead of permitting the 
necessary infrastructure to diversely move products to the 
northeast, we have a commingled supply that will end up being 
under the same consequences as the--of a natural disaster of 
what we are trying to get to. So I just would hope the 
Department would focus on existing operational maintenance 
challenges associated with the--dump money into ineffective 
product reserves.
    And with that, I will yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman. I will now go to Mr. 
Pfluger from Texas for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Pfluger. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Secretary, thank you for being here. Would you consider 
yourself the principal adviser to the President for energy 
matters?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, I am the Secretary of Energy. I am one 
of the main advisors, but he has got a few.
    Mr. Pfluger. OK, but you are the principal advisor.
    Ms. Granholm. Well, I don't know that I would say that. I 
think he has got some very good advisors in the White House.
    Mr. Pfluger. I believe in this position. I represent the 
Permian Basin. We have had this conversation before. You know, 
we produce about 43 percent of the country's crude oil. It is 
the most secure supply of oil and gas in the entire world. And 
in fact, I would also go a step further, that it is probably 
the only thing that has kept this economy going, despite the 
policies that we have seen. I am very concerned about those 
policies. And I just have a couple of questions for you based 
on, you know, being the Secretary of Energy.
    When the President went to Saudi Arabia and asked OPEC+ to 
increase production, was that your recommendation to him to do 
that?
    Ms. Granholm. I think the President wanted to see greater 
production in the United States also.
    Mr. Pfluger. We have that ability.
    Ms. Granholm. And----
    Mr. Pfluger. That is why H.R. 1----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. He has been asking for it.
    Mr. Pfluger [continuing]. Is so important. And Madam 
Secretary, you are the Secretary of Energy. We are blessed, as 
a country, to have the most enormous amount of reserves, not 
just of oil and gas but of so many other critical minerals and 
things that have been discussed today. Did you recommend that 
he go to Saudi Arabia and ask for them to produce more oil?
    Ms. Granholm. I was not in that conversation.
    Mr. Pfluger. So he did not ask the Secretary of Energy 
for----
    Ms. Granholm. I was not in the conversation.
    Mr. Pfluger [continuing]. Your recommendation?
    Ms. Granholm. But I will say this: He has been very strong 
about asking for greater supply here in the United States.
    Mr. Pfluger. We have that capacity to do that. I am 
extremely troubled with the fact that, for a political 
emergency, the President released almost half--over half of our 
SPR.
    At what point in time will you make a recommendation to the 
President or act upon current law to refill?
    Ms. Granholm. We will be refilling, as you are probably----
    Mr. Pfluger. What is the--do you have a timeline?
    Ms. Granholm. As soon as we are finished with the current 
congressionally mandated sale, which we are required to do 
before the end of the fiscal year, as soon as that is done--
because, as you are probably aware, you can't take in and 
release at the same time--we will begin the process of----
    Mr. Pfluger. I would like for you to follow up for the 
record on that one, to let us know what that timeline looks 
like.
    I am going to move to the next question----
    Ms. Granholm. Starting this summer.
    Mr. Pfluger. You said we cannot flip a switch today, but 
the administration has actually tried to flip that switch.
    You know, just a couple of questions for you when it comes 
to--what is the total amount of electricity that our country 
needs on an annual basis?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, right now we have about 1,400 gigawatts 
on our grid.
    Mr. Pfluger. On an annual basis, what does that equate to?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, 1,400 gigawatts on the grid, so how 
much electricity do--I mean, we have a bunch of different 
sources of electricity that are provided. We use about 3----
    Mr. Pfluger. It is about 4 trillion kilowatt hours per 
year.
    Ms. Granholm. Oh, OK.
    Mr. Pfluger. And I would expect you to know that because we 
have a 2032 mandate to get to electric vehicles, like my 
colleague just mentioned.
    My next question is, what will the increase in that total 
amount of annual----
    Ms. Granholm. We have to double the size of the electric 
grid by 2035.
    Mr. Pfluger. Double.
    Ms. Granholm. Mm-hmm.
    Mr. Pfluger. So what portion of our grid is serviced by 
hydrocarbons right now?
    Ms. Granholm. About 40--no, 40 percent is natural gas. 
About 17 percent is coal, and the rest is clean.
    Mr. Pfluger. OK, so it is about 20 percent--22 percent 
coal----
    Ms. Granholm. No, 17 percent.
    Mr. Pfluger [continuing]. Nineteen percent nuclear----
    Ms. Granholm. As of right now.
    Mr. Pfluger. This is from you all's website.
    Ms. Granholm. Well, the----
    Mr. Pfluger. Thirty-eight percent natural gas and 20 
percent renewable.
    So what--in 2032, if we have to double--and thank you for 
that answer. That is actually more than I was expecting you to 
say. If we have to double the amount of electricity, where is 
that going to come from?
    Ms. Granholm. That is going to come from growing our energy 
pie.
    Mr. Pfluger. And what----
    Ms. Granholm. Increasing----
    Mr. Pfluger [continuing]. Pieces of pie will grow?
    Ms. Granholm. We want to increase clean.
    Mr. Pfluger. Clean.
    Ms. Granholm. So----
    Mr. Pfluger. So what does that mean? What does clean----
    Ms. Granholm. So that means let's increase nuclear, let's 
increase hydroelectric power, let's increase geothermal.
    Mr. Pfluger. What about----
    Ms. Granholm. Let's increase----
    Mr. Pfluger. What about in places that don't have hydro?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, that is why you have a transmission 
grid, to be able to bring electricity from where it is 
generated to where it is needed.
    Mr. Pfluger. When was the last time you visited the Permian 
Basin?
    Ms. Granholm. I have not been to the Permian Basin.
    Mr. Pfluger. It is the most prolific production area for 
energy in this country.
    Ms. Granholm. Will you invite me?
    Mr. Pfluger. I have invited you.
    Ms. Granholm. Ah, I didn't know that.
    Mr. Pfluger. I invited you last year, when I saw you in a 
meeting.
    Ms. Granholm. Great.
    Mr. Pfluger. And I will invite you again.
    This area helped us win World War II. This area has lifted 
a billion people out of poverty. This administration is 
choosing to not use the best-of-the-above strategy. I am not an 
all-of-the-above kind of person, I am a best-of-the-above. And 
that is different for different places. Hydrocarbons in some 
places, clean natural gas. Maybe if you have hydroelectric. We 
have more wind energy in my congressional district than the 
entire State of California. Come see it. It doesn't always 
work. The wind in west Texas in July, when it is 110 degrees in 
the middle of summer, doesn't blow.
    Ms. Granholm. But your sun shines.
    Mr. Pfluger. But--it does. And give me a battery that works 
for more than 4 hours that services the largest electric----
    Ms. Granholm. We are working on that.
    Mr. Pfluger [continuing]. Grid in the country.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Mr. Pfluger. We don't want to be like Europe. We don't want 
to be like California. That is why we are trying to use a best-
of-the-above approach.
    My time is expired, but I would like to see, Mr. Chairman, 
the timeline for when the SPR is going to be refilled. I yield 
back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. We will go to Mr. 
Carter from Georgia.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you 
letting me waive on to this committee.
    Madam Secretary, thank you for being here. I believe I am 
your last questioner, so----
    Ms. Granholm. I don't think so.
    Mr. Carter. One more? Oh, you got one more, OK. Well, 
nevertheless, I am your next to last. And I want to ask you, as 
I am sure you are aware, on another subcommittee that I serve 
on we had EPA Administrator Regan before us just a couple of 
days ago, just the other day. And it is my understanding that 
the Department of Energy and the EPA have signed a joint 
memorandum of understanding on electric reliability and that 
your announcement of this MOU highlights the challenges of 
transitioning to clean energy.
    And--but, you know, I find it interesting. Since that MOU 
was announced in March, it seems like the EPA has announced as 
many new rules or changes that it can that would threaten grid 
reliability. I mean, just today EPA announced a new power plan 
rule that is going to put significant new requirements on our 
baseload generation. I am really concerned about this. This is 
after a holiday season that saw nine States experience 
blackouts and brownouts.
    I mean, even in the State of Georgia--fortunately, we 
didn't have any blackouts or brownouts, but the EMCs tell me 
that we were at peak capacity, that we could not have done any 
more than what we did. And we are a growing State. My district 
is a growing State. I just had the largest economic development 
project ever announced in the district, in the State of 
Georgia. So we are growing, and we are going to need 
reliability. We are going to need that in our State, and the 
rest of the country is going to need it, as well.
    Last week, FERC Commissioner Mark Christie said that the 
problem is not the addition of intermittent resources but the 
rapid subtraction of dispatchable resources like coal and gas. 
He also said, and I quote, ``The U.S. is heading for a 
reliability crisis because dispatchable generating resources 
are retiring far too quickly and in quantities that threaten 
our ability to keep the lights on.'' Do you agree that the U.S. 
is heading for a reliability crisis?
    Ms. Granholm. No, I think we have to do it right, and I 
think that is why----
    Mr. Carter. Do you think we are doing it right?
    Ms. Granholm. Well, I think what the EPA rule did was to 
say we want to reduce emissions. And it didn't say how. We have 
been working on all of this technology to decarbonize. And 
whether it is coal or natural gas, we want clean baseload 
power.
    I heard a number of Members of this side of the aisle say 
this is about emissions. So let's work on that. Let's 
decarbonize and allow for baseload power to exist.
    Mr. Carter. Well, I am encouraged to hear you say that, 
because I believe that. I don't believe it is about fewer 
choices, I believe it is about less carbon----
    Ms. Granholm. And more technology.
    Mr. Carter [continuing]. Not less choices. So I am 
encouraged to hear you say that. But then I see the rules that 
are being implemented here by the EPA that concern me, because 
it is putting our grid reliability at risk here.
    You know, I had the opportunity to go to Europe last year 
as a member of the Conservative Climate Caucus, and we saw and 
witnessed in Europe what has happened there. And they have 
allowed their policies to get ahead of their innovation, 
resulting in a mess, to be quite honest with you. They closed 
down their nuclear plants and ended up going back to coal.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Mr. Carter. Very important lessons to be learned there, and 
I certainly hope we are paying attention and learning those 
lessons.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, we certainly are. And I agree with you. 
We have to be thoughtful about this transition.
    Mr. Carter. But, you know, again, the Biden administration 
has said that they--by 2030 they want 80 percent renewable 
energy. And right now you said it is how much of our portfolio?
    Ms. Granholm. We want to get to 100 percent by 2035 with an 
80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
    Mr. Carter. OK, OK. And what are we at right now?
    Ms. Granholm. In terms of--we are at--in terms of clean, we 
have 20 percent that is nuclear, we have 20 percent that is 
renewable.
    Mr. Carter. Are you still confident that that is an 
achievable goal?
    Ms. Granholm. I do--I am, I am, because of the policies 
that were just adopted. I know you didn't vote for them, but--
--
    Mr. Carter. No, and----
    Ms. Granholm [continuing]. Are incentivizing----
    Mr. Carter [continuing]. I am not going to vote for them, 
because I believe that we are going to make the same mistake 
that they made in Europe and allow our policies to get ahead of 
our innovation. And we can't do that. We can't afford to do 
that.
    Look, I would submit to you, Madam Secretary, that what has 
happened in our economy is a direct result of the policies of 
this administration. It is self-inflicted. Day one, this 
administration declared war on fossil fuels, resulting in 
higher gas prices, resulting in higher inflation, resulting in 
higher interest rates. And now we have got the problems that we 
have got here, whereas my colleague just pointed out we have 
got an abundance of oil here, we have got an abundance.
    And again, here we are in a nation that has decreased our 
carbon emissions more in the last decade than the next 12 
countries combined, while growing our economy.
    Ms. Granholm. And we have also--we are still a record 
producer of oil and of natural gas. So declaring war has not 
happened. In fact, we are at record production.
    Mr. Carter. We are at record production, but we can do even 
better is the point. And we can--we don't need to decrease 
choices, we need to decrease carbon. That is what we should be 
doing.
    Ms. Granholm. Let's work on it.
    Mr. Carter. Madam Secretary, thank you for being here.
    Ms. Granholm. Thank you.
    Mr. Carter. And I am willing to work on it with you, and I 
look forward to that.
    Ms. Granholm. Great.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time has expired, and I will go 
to the last congresswoman of the day, Ms. Barragan, for 5 
minutes.
    Ms. Barragan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Madam Secretary, I have been here for a short time, but 
very impressed at your ability to respond to very specific 
questions.
    Madam Secretary, do you know what environmental justice 
means?
    Ms. Granholm. I do.
    Ms. Barragan. That would be that would mean that you know 
more than the last administration's Energy Secretary that sat 
before this committee and couldn't describe it or explain it. 
So when I hear these very direct questions about specific 
numbers and places, I am very impressed.
    Secretary Granholm, the infrastructure law President Biden 
and Democrats in Congress passed included 84 million for 
demonstration projects that use enhanced geothermal technology. 
There is a lot of geothermal potential in California and other 
parts of the country. How is the Department of Energy using 
these funds to meet its enhanced Geothermal Shot goal to cut 
geothermal energy costs? And what more can Congress do to 
support your work?
    Ms. Granholm. I am so glad you asked this question, because 
I am such a huge fan of geothermal, the heat beneath our feet, 
which is 24/7 dispatchable, baseload, clean power. We need to 
do more.
    So we do have this Earthshot. The Earthshot is to reduce 
the cost of geothermal so that we can see more of it happen.
    We also have the ability through the Inflation Reduction 
Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help invest in 
facilities that be--that are able to get to that geothermal.
    Honestly, the oil and gas companies should be embracing 
this, given their expertise in frack--in hydraulic fracturing. 
They know where the hotspots are, and they know how to get to 
them, and they know the subsurface, and they have employees who 
have a skill set that is ready to go.
    So we are very enthusiastic about continuing the technology 
advances, particularly on the drill bits as well as on the 
extraction processes, whether it is enhanced or advanced 
geothermal, closed loop or open loop. We are very interested in 
all of it.
    Ms. Barragan. Oh, great. And I understand that today the 
Department of Energy is holding an Enhanced Geothermal Shot 
Summit. And so I want to thank you for your commitment to this 
clean energy resource.
    And the followup to that, if the Department of Energy can 
meet the cost reduction goals of enhanced geothermal, I believe 
that is going to unlock 24/7 power in many parts of the United 
States. How significant would this be for our climate and clean 
energy goals?
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, it is--you know, to all of the questions 
that we were just talking about clean, dispatchable baseload 
power, it would unlock so much. There is the potential for 
geothermal, no matter how far down you go--it all depends on 
how far down you go--it is everywhere. And so if we could 
really unearth that, if we could really crack the code on it, 
it could be the Holy Grail.
    Ms. Barragan. Great. And this is a bipartisan issue. It is 
something I have been working on with my colleague across the 
aisle on--who represents Utah, Mr. Curtis.
    I want to chat with you about marine energy. Secretary 
Granholm, the infrastructure law also provided $70 million to 
further develop marine energy. There is a lot of wave energy 
potential off the coast of California, and a pilot project soon 
underway at AltaSea in my district, which is at the Port of Los 
Angeles. Can you tell me how the Department of Energy is using 
these funds to advance marine energy?
    And what more can Congress do to support the marine energy 
research and development?
    And just to give you an idea, I recently had a company from 
Israel come and share their--what they are doing there to bring 
down to the Los Angeles port that can basically produce energy 
from waves.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes.
    Ms. Barragan. And I think it is pretty remarkable. And so I 
just thought I would ask about that.
    Ms. Granholm. Yes, it is hugely--you know, the--just the 
ability for machines under--at the floor of the seabed to be 
able to harness that energy is a huge opportunity. We are 
trying to reduce the costs of those machines so that it becomes 
affordable.
    But here is what we have done. The Water Power Technology 
Office, they have actually issued now three funding 
opportunities to support the impact of the expansion of low-
impact hydropower and pumped storage hydropower, whether it 
is--there's dams, but there is also--you can have pumped 
storage on a smaller sort of distributed manner. All of those 
are technology advances that we are focused on.
    We also have put $40 million in the budget for the National 
Marine Energy Centers, and the marine energy R&D is that 40 
million--excuse me, 70 million funding opportunity that we 
announced this week.
    Ms. Barragan. Great. Well, thank you, and I appreciate that 
you mentioned that in the Inflation Reduction Act Democrats 
have included billions in home electrification incentives with 
priority for low- and moderate-income households so they can 
make that switch.
    Again, thank you for your time.
    Ms. Granholm. Thank you.
    Ms. Barragan. And with that I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentlelady, she yields back.
    I ask unanimous consent to insert in the record the 
documents included on the staff hearing document list.
    Without objection, that will be the order.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr. Duncan. I will remind Members they have 10 business 
days to submit questions for the record, and I ask the witness 
to respond to the questions promptly. Members should submit 
their questions by the close of business on May 25th.
    And Madam Secretary, thanks for being here. Thanks for 
bearing with us during votes.
    Ms. Granholm. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Duncan. And we will stand adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 5:46 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
    [Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:]
