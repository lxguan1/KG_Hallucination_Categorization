 ADDRESSING THE OPIOID CRISIS: EXAMINING THE SUPPORT ACT 5 YEARS LATER

                              ----------                              


                          FRIDAY, JUNE 9, 2023

                   House of Representatives
                             Subcommittee on Health
                           Committee on Energy and Commerce
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 9:30 a.m., at 
the Gettysburg National Park Visitor Center, 1195 Baltimore 
Pike, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Hon. Brett Guthrie (chairman of 
the subcommittee) presiding.
    Members present: Representatives Guthrie, Bucshon, 
Griffith, Joyce, Obernolte, and Tonko.
    Mr. Guthrie. Good morning. The committee will come to 
order.
    Hey, thanks, everybody, for being here. It is such a great 
opportunity for us to be together. And I will recognize myself 
for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRETT GUTHRIE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
           CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY

    And I just want to say how important it is we are here 
today, and I know a lot of times it is nice for us to get out 
of Washington to come to a place such as this. And a lot of 
people see, on television, there is a lot of, sometimes, 
fighting back and forth between the two different parties. But 
I will tell you, as we looked at what is going on in recovery, 
addiction, and overdoses, we have worked together, and in 2015 
we did the SUPPORT Act together. And so Representative Tonko 
here, all of us, are here to work together to move forward. And 
now we are up for reauthorization of the SUPPORT Act.
    A lot of us got here last night and had the chance for a 
very sobering walk around this battlefield, and standing where 
Pickett's Charge was. And John Hoptak, I think was his name, 
was our interpreter, who said 51,000 people over the course of 
3 days were wounded, injured, or killed. You know, over 100,000 
people every year die of overdoses. And you sit there and try 
to absorb those numbers as you are watching and trying to 
imagine what happened here. I mean, the numbers are staggering 
in this area, to a horrible degree, as well. And we all work 
together to try to move forward.
    And I have a formal opening statement, and I am actually 
not going to give it. I will submit it for the record.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Guthrie follows;]
    [GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Guthrie. And I want to recognize my good friend, Dr. 
John Joyce, who represents this area, for the remainder of my 
time. I yield to Dr. John Joyce.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you for yielding, Chairman Guthrie. And I 
would also like to thank Chair Rodgers, Ranking Member Tonko 
for coming to Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District. The 
poignancy of being at Gettysburg is not lost on the Members of 
Congress. The battles that we face when we deal with addiction 
and the battles that families face is an important message to 
bring home with the great panels that we have assembled here 
today.
    As we approach the 160th anniversary of the Battle of 
Gettysburg, we do recognize the over 7,000 Americans who lost 
their lives at this site and remember that sacrifice as we meet 
on another incredibly devastating issue, and that is the issue 
of addiction.
    That is the scourge upon America, and drug overdoses, which 
in recent years, as Chair Guthrie just pointed out, have taken 
over 100,000 American lives annually, leaving behind the 
devastation to families, to friends, to coworkers.
    As we look as a committee and as a Congress to address 
these matters, we have to look to the communities, and that is 
what we are here today to do. We want to hear what 
recommendations, what impact, how the SUPPORT Act can be 
enhanced, how it can be extended.
    So far this year, we have made progress by passing the Halt 
Fentanyl Act, which will permanently schedule fentanyl 
analogues that have been flooding our communities with a deadly 
substance, leaving death and tragedy in its wake.
    In 2022 alone, DEA seized almost 379 million deadly doses 
of fentanyl, which is enough to kill every man, woman, and 
child in the United States. And that was just what was seized. 
That is what we were able to capture. That is not what came 
through and ended up on the streets throughout the United 
States.
    And I am hopeful this bill will pass the Senate and be 
signed into law, but there is a lot more work that needs to be 
done in supporting local law enforcement, healthcare providers, 
and patients who are facing these issues every day, with those 
in the throes of addiction.
    In 2018, President Trump signed the SUPPORT Act into law, 
which is a comprehensive measure aimed at combating addiction 
and helping treatment for those facing the disease. Yet despite 
these efforts and the exacerbated response by COVID-19, we are 
still seeing those increased deaths, and we must examine how 
the SUPPORT Act can be enhanced, improved, and address the 
issues that you bring for us today.
    We must also be examining what policies need to be 
addressed to ensure that all patients have access to crisis and 
recovery services and the ability to receive the treatment that 
they so desperately need. Some of these barriers include 
looking at the impact of the IMD Exclusion, which has 
restricted access to residential and inpatient care, and 
whether this can be modernized to ensure the availability for 
the treatment of patients.
    The SUPPORT Act also recognizes that to ultimately be 
successful in combating the opioid misuse crisis, we must do a 
better job helping the 50 million Americans who suffer from 
chronic pain. Pain is a serious and growing disease which is 
more prevalent in older adults, women, veterans, blue-collar 
workers and people living right here in Pennsylvania's rural 
13th Congressional District.
    The SUPPORT Act contains numerous pain-related provisions 
directing the Federal Government to promote patient awareness 
and access to nonopioid therapies. I would like to request that 
the statement from the U.S. Pain Foundation be entered into the 
record.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Guthrie. The gentleman yields back. And I know we are a 
couple of minutes over, 50 seconds over. I just want to say 
what I should have said, how much we appreciate the National 
Park Service for hosting us. You see the men and women and law 
enforcement here making sure we are safe and secure. I know you 
do not deal with these kinds of things every day, I know, but 
every day you deal with what we are here to talk about, and we 
appreciate what you guys do.
    I will now recognize my good friend from New York, 
Representative Tonko, for 5 minutes for an opening.

   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PAUL TONKO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK

    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Chair, and good morning, everyone, 
and thank you to everyone for joining here for this very 
important topic in this special way, and welcome to our 
panelists.
    This is a vital hearing, and I thank Chair Guthrie and my 
colleagues for hosting it. As a co-Chair of the bipartisan 
Addiction, Treatment, and Recovery Caucus I am all too familiar 
with the devastating impact of the disease of addiction. This 
is a loss many of us know all too well--the loss of a daughter, 
a son, father, mother, a sister, or a brother, a neighbor dying 
much too young and leaving behind a grieving family. 
Communities are being ripped apart by poisons seemingly beyond 
our control.
    Last year in our Nation, there was an estimated 109,680 
overdose deaths. That is 109,680 lives lost that impact far 
greater numbers than we can imagine. Think of how many people 
that is, every single day needlessly dying and having their 
lives cut short. Think of the magnitude of all of those 
impacted by those 109,680 loved ones. For each of those 
individuals, there is a whole universe of friends, of families, 
of communities impacted.
    I recognize that many of our brave witnesses today were 
brought here by tragedy and by terrible pain. I hope that as a 
committee and as colleagues and friends we can learn from their 
pain and act together with a sense of urgency.
    This year, with the reauthorization of the SUPPORT Act, we 
have an opportunity to address the devastating disease of 
addiction. I think we can all agree there is a crisis at hand. 
Sadly, in 2021, 94 percent of people aged 12 or older with a 
substance use disorder did not receive any treatment. It is a 
startling statistic but one that makes it clear there is a 
massive gap in access to treatment.
    Over the last decade, I have recognized this gap and have 
made a focus of advocacy in Congress. I am knocking out every 
single barrier to addiction treatment so that, when an 
individual struggling with the disease of addiction reaches out 
for help, we have a medical system ready to welcome them with 
open arms. As a committee, I ask that we work together to make 
access to affordable and quality addiction treatment our 
highest priority. I am heartened that as I look across at the 
members here I see a coalition that understands the importance 
of that goal. In this moment I feel hopeful that together we 
can find common ground and take that immediate action.
    During my time in Congress, we have worked together to pass 
CARA, the SUPPORT Act, and most recently our bipartisan mental 
health package. These policies have provided billions of 
dollars to support the American people and combat that overdose 
crisis. In particular, we have had a lot of bipartisan success 
when we worked to pass the SUPPORT Act into law back in 2018. 
Together we made progress forward in access to and coverage for 
medications for opioid use disorder. We expanded the providers 
who can prescribe MAT, and we also created an innovative new 
demonstration program for reentry that has now been put into 
action.
    But we still have more work to do to protect the most 
vulnerable. Five years later, it is clear that there is 
widespread support for good reentry policy. I humbly ask, let's 
come together and pass the bipartisan Reentry Act, which would 
be game-changer for reducing overdose deaths and suicides by 
allowing all states to provide prerelease care to Medicaid-
eligible individuals up to 30 days prior to release from 
incarceration. Sheriffs across the country are calling for 
passage of the Reentry Act. Medical providers and addiction 
advocates are calling for passage. Beth Macy, the author of 
``Dopesick,'' who has seen this disease firsthand, has called 
for passage of this legislation. Let's heed their call.
    I also hope we can have a comprehensive discussion on how 
to expand access to treatment, including medications for opioid 
use disorder such as buprenorphine and methadone. We also 
should expand access to naloxone, testing strips, and syringe 
services so that lives can be saved. I also hope that we will 
take a look at a bill that is called Due Process.
    I look forward to discussions over the coming months on how 
we can support policies to save lives. Addressing the disease 
of addiction must include a compassionate response, bolstered 
by the pillars of prevention, of treatment, and of recovery.
    I also want to thank everyone for being willing to discuss 
addiction. For far too long, the disease of addiction has 
carried an awful stigma. Together, by gathering here to openly 
discuss this, we help share that addiction is not a moral 
failure but a disease, and if we treat it as such we will be 
victorious. We can share how recovery is not easy and often not 
a linear path, but that a light in recovery can be filled with 
so much hope and serve as inspiration to each and every one of 
us.
    We also make it clear that we will not turn our backs on 
those who are suffering from addiction. We recognize their pain 
and the barriers that make treatment and recovery difficult. 
However, when someone has that moment of clarity and seeks 
treatment, we should have systems in place that move heaven and 
earth to get people the very best treatment available.
    So I look forward to learning more from our witnesses here 
today, and I promise you that I will continue my fight, in a 
bipartisan manner, to ensure treatment on demand so that all of 
those who are suffering from this disease of despair have 
access to treatment and, most importantly, hope.
    Thank you. With that I yield back.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Tonko follows;]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Guthrie. The gentleman yields back. And now we are 
going to go to the witnesses' opening statements. And for those 
of you who have not testified before Congress before, you have 
opening statements of 5 minutes. You will see a green light, 
yellow light, red light. So I guess--1 minute out green, or 
yellow, or 30 seconds?--1 minute out yellow. And so when you 
see red, start wrapping up.
    Now this is important, so I am not going to have a heavy 
gavel. If you have a thought you want to get out and it turns 
red on you, just feel free not to stop midthought, midsentence, 
but begin to start summarizing if you get to that point. But we 
are here to learn, so I am not going to have a heavy gavel on 
you, because we know we have some stories that we need to hear 
and ideas we need to share.
    So with doing that, to introduce our witnesses today I am 
going to yield to Dr. Joyce, who will introduce you all, and 
then I will call on you each time.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Chair.
    Our first witness is Mr. Mike Straley, founder of Leah's 
Legacy Foundation. Mike and his wife Robin tragically lost 
their daughter, Leah, to opioid overdose after a long battle 
with substance use disorder. He is the author of the ``The 
CALLing'' and started, in his daughter's memory, Leah's Legacy 
Foundation in an effort to help others who are struggling with 
substance use disorder.
    Our next witness will be Dr. Mitchell Crawford, who is the 
Medical Director for Specialized Treatment and Recovery, 
WellSpan Health, and Director of Addiction Services at WellSpan 
Health Facilities. Dr. Crawford is a clinical specialist in 
treating substance use disorders, such as opioids, alcohol, and 
nicotine, and behavioral addictions as well. Dr. Crawford 
completed his residency at Harvard South Shore Psychiatric 
Residency Training Program.
    Next will be Chief Bill Ceravola of the Reading Township 
Police Department. Chief Ceravola has been in law enforcement 
since 1995, and began his career as a crime scene investigator 
for the Kenner City Police Department in Louisiana. Prior to 
his time as chief of police for Reading Township, he was chief 
and officer in charge for Adams County Police Department.
    Our fourth witness is Ms. Emily Keller. Ms. Keller is the 
former mayor of Hagerstown, Maryland, and prior to her time as 
mayor, she served on the Hagerstown City Council. Currently, 
she is the Special Secretary of Opioid Response, Opioid 
Operational Command Center, in the Office of the Maryland 
Governor, Wes Moore.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. That concludes witnesses' 
introductions. Ms. Keller, we are going to go my left to right, 
so I will call on you first for your 5 minutes for an opening 
statement.

    STATEMENT OF EMILY KELLER, SPECIAL SECRETARY OF OPIOID 
  RESPONSE, OPIOID OPERATIONAL COMMAND CENTER, OFFICE OF THE 
   GOVERNOR, STATE OF MARYLAND; MICHAEL L. STRALEY, FOUNDER, 
  LEAH'S LEGACY FOUNDATION; MITCHELL CRAWFORD, D.O., MEDICAL 
    DIRECTOR, SPECIALIZED TREATMENT AND RECOVERY TEAM, AND 
  DIRECTOR, ADDICTION SERVICES, WELLSPAN HEALTH; AND WILLIAM 
      CERAVOLA, CHIEF, READING TOWNSHIP POLICE DEPARTMENT

                   STATEMENT OF EMILY KELLER

    Ms. Keller. Thank you. Chairman Guthrie and honorable 
members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to 
participate in today's hearing. My name is Emily Keller, and I 
am Maryland's Special Secretary of Opioid Response. In this 
role, I oversee the Opioid Operational Command Center.
    I come before you today as someone who has been directly 
affected by the overdose crisis. My life in public service 
began after seeing my best friend, Ashley, struggle with a 
substance use disorder for many years as she failed to access 
the care that she needed. After she lost her battle with her 
disease, I dedicated my life's work to doing everything that I 
could do to promote access to care for others like her. I made 
a promise to her that I would be loud for her, and that is 
exactly what I intend to do.
    My story, tragically, is not unique. So many Americans have 
experienced this same loss as overdose rates skyrocket in our 
country. About seven people a day lose their lives to overdose 
in Maryland alone. Efforts such as the SUPPORT Act of 2018 have 
increased our ability in Maryland to respond to this crisis by 
expanding support for treatment and recovery services, by 
increasing access to medically assisted treatment, telehealth 
opportunities, and advancing public health screening and 
prevention.
    In 2021, more than 107,000 people lost their lives due to 
fatal drug overdose in the United States, an increase of nearly 
15 percent from the prior year. In 2020, Maryland ranked sixth-
highest in the Nation for drug overdose death rates.
    For those living in rural communities, access to care can 
be particularly challenging. For those without a car, that are 
living in communities that lack public transportation, this 
barrier can be insurmountable. The ability to utilize 
telehealth to prescribe MOUD is critical to help reduce 
overdose deaths, especially in communities like my own.
    One in five incarcerated individuals are currently serving 
a sentence related to a drug offense. Also, the leading cause 
of death for people leaving prison is overdose. Maryland has 
taken steps to try to lessen the risk of overdose for people 
who are incarcerated by passing the Opioid Use Disorder 
Examination and Treatment Act in 2019, which requires an array 
of substance use disorder services be available in jails. While 
medical services are available in carceral settings, SUD 
services are rare. Substance use disorder is a medical 
condition and deserves to be treated as such. We would not deny 
someone antibiotics if they were sick, so how is this any 
different?
    In April of this year, the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services issued guidance encouraging States to apply for 
Medicaid Section 1115 waiver, which allows States to use 
Medicaid for medical services, including SUD services for 
people otherwise eligible 90 days prerelease. We applaud 
Congress and HHS for making this opportunity available to 
States. I am excited to share that Maryland is using this 
guidance to prepare an 1115 waiver application. Governor Moore 
is embracing evidence-based solutions such as harm reduction, 
which can be used as a model nationally.
    Harm reduction is a set of practices that aims to reduce 
the severe health impacts associated with substance use. 
Meeting people where they are at is especially important 
because all people, despite their circumstances, deserve to be 
treated with dignity and respect. Ensuring that every person, 
school, and business has naloxone available is an effective way 
to fight the overdose crisis. The only thing naloxone enables 
is breathing, and having this lifesaving medication available 
is key.
    Individuals who participate in harm reduction programs are 
five times more likely to enter treatment, which is 
significantly higher than the 1 in 10 individuals who enter 
treatment outside of a harm reduction program.
    In addition to providing support services and connections 
to treatment, harm reduction also includes syringe service 
programs, which greatly reduces the spread of infectious 
diseases such as HIV and hepatitis.
    As we continue to have these conversations and enact 
policies to help combat the overdose crisis, including people 
who use drugs in conversation is essential. Taking a ``nothing 
is about us without us'' approach will do so much good. We want 
to make sure that people who use drugs have a real voice when 
it comes to the creation of policies and programs that are 
created to help or affect them.
    Governor Moore has vowed to lead with love, and that starts 
by saving lives. Our priorities include addressing the needs of 
the individuals that are most at risk for overdose, taking a 
public health approach to substance use solutions, and leading 
on evidence-based practices. It also means removing as many 
barriers to care as possible so that individuals can access 
treatment and recovery services at the critical times when they 
decide they are ready to seek help. No one will be left behind.
    Thankfully, the SUPPORT Act was groundbreaking in that it 
was the first piece of Federal legislation to truly address the 
overdose crisis foremost as a public health issue. This 
approach is critical to addressing the actual and immediate 
needs of people who use drugs and people with substance use 
disorder.
    As the overdose crisis continues to evolve and the number 
of stimulant-related overdoses increases or new drug trends 
emerge, such as xylazine, we need to remain nimble in our 
response efforts and ensure policy meets the actual needs of 
individuals with substance use disorder.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to address the 
subcommittee today, for your dedication to this issue, and for 
the hard work you do on behalf of the American people.

    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you for being here and thank you for 
sharing. Hagerstown is a beautiful town.
    Ms. Keller. Thank you.
    Mr. Guthrie. I get to drive through sometimes when I drive 
from Kentucky.
    Mr. Straley, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.

                STATEMENT OF MICHAEL L. STRALEY

    Mr. Straley. Thank you, Chairman Guthrie and fellow 
committee members. My name is Mike Straley.
    My wife Robin and I were scheduled to have dinner with our 
daughter, Leah Renee Straley, on Thursday, March 1, 2018, at a 
Delray Beach, Florida, restaurant. Instead, we had her memorial 
service in Hagerstown, Maryland. Leah Renee Straley passed on 
Valentine's Day 2018. Her cause of death: fentanyl poisoning. 
She is forever 26.
    Every day there is grief.
    Leah's addiction started when she was 14 years old, much of 
it attributed to peer pressure. It started with marijuana, in 
her case, the drug of choice and the gateway drug that led to 
more potent drugs: cocaine, heroin, painkillers, and ultimately 
fentanyl.
    We are a middle-class family. She was raised in church and 
had a loving family and friends whose parents were business and 
shop owners. Addiction does not discriminate.
    As parents, we were naive to her addiction at first because 
she concealed it well. Then the physical signs became apparent. 
As parents, we wanted to fix the problem, but we quickly 
learned those who are going through addiction can only help 
themselves. In Leah's case, she sought that help.
    She entered her first detox center, a local treatment 
facility in Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Our insurance did 
not cover the cost. We had to self-pay, $14,000 for 2 weeks. We 
tapped into our savings and got help from my parents.
    We may as well have burned that money because in less than 
a week after her discharge, Leah was back into the addiction 
cycle.
    She graduated high school with honors and received a 
college stipend to attend a local 2-year school. Her major: 
drug counseling. She never completed that degree. At the time 
of her passing, she was a first-semester junior after starting 
and stopping her college studies.
    She would enter 12 detox centers from age 16 to 26. She 
lived in at least eight different sober-living homes, from 
California to North Carolina to back here in Pennsylvania. Her 
best treatment was in California, where she had 9 months' 
sobriety.
    I changed jobs and my insurance covered the detox 
treatments and sober-living home stints. Our home was not the 
answer for her to return to live permanently. As a father, it 
was difficult at first to tell her that, but she knew it as 
well. When she was in a sober-living environment that 
emphasized community, she thrived. Otherwise, she struggled.
    When she turned 26, she was no longer on my insurance. She 
had to turn to state insurance. She sought out a sober-living 
facility in western Pennsylvania. In her words, it was a dump--
bed bugs, unsanitary conditions all throughout the house, 
including the kitchen.
    She decided she was going to take up an offer to visit a 
``friend'' in Delray Beach, Florida. Leah told us her 
``friend'' was ``clean.'' They were roommates at the sober-
living home in California. My dad and I drove her to the 
airport on February 10, 2018. I hugged and kissed her before 
her flight and told her that her biggest fans were at home and 
that we believed in her, like I had so many times before. She 
said she knew she was loved. It would be my last hug and kiss 
from my daughter.
    Fast forward to the morning of February 14, 2018. I 
received a call at work. I work at Fulton County Medical Center 
as the executive director of the foundation. At 9:02 a.m. I 
received a call from the front desk that two Pennsylvania State 
Police officers were in the lobby, and they wanted to talk with 
me. We entered a private room, and it was there they informed 
me that my beloved Leah was found dead earlier that morning in 
Delray Beach, Florida.
    I do not remember much about that conversation but drove 
myself to Hagerstown, Maryland, to break the news to my wife. I 
ran out of paper napkins in my truck about halfway through the 
60-minute drive. We then informed our son, Chris, and then my 
parents. My mom, for over a month, kept a dish towel on her 
shoulder. It was constantly soaked with tears.
    Grief is not the absence of love. It is proof that love is 
still there, and it will be always there.
    My wife and I started Leah's Legacy Foundation in 2019, a 
nonprofit committed to helping women in recovery. We provide 
Leah Legacy purple bags filled with over 40 essentials to women 
in sober living. We share Leah's journey and ours as grieving 
parents. I am a speaker and author with a focus on schools, 
civic groups, conferences, and seminars.
    To date we have gifted 523 Leah Legacy bags to women in 
recovery. We also have Leah's Gathering Place, a small house 
that was part of our family's property. We have a houseguest 
there that has over 6 years of sobriety. We also have life 
skill classes in that house, such as basic banking, Hygiene 
101, cooking, and banking for women in recovery.
    We have turned misery into a mission, calamity into a 
cause. We want to live our life with a purpose and to honor our 
beloved Leah Renee Straley.
    Thank you.

    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you for that powerful testimony.
    Dr. Crawford, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

              STATEMENT OF MITCHELL CRAWFORD, D.O.

    Dr. Crawford. America's addiction crisis touches nearly 
every American in some way, including those of us in this room, 
including me. I lost my sister, who was a great person and whom 
I loved dearly, to an overdose in 2015. In the grief for my 
sister's loss, much like you have heard, I vowed to focus my 
work on addiction treatment.
    Fortunately, I have been given an opportunity to do that 
work. Unfortunately, I still experience the loss of friends, 
colleagues, patients to fatal overdoses.
    It is important to note that, sadly, my story is not 
unique. However, I have also witnessed countless patients find 
long-term recovery, and this continues to provide me with 
renewed hope. We have treatment, and treatment works.
    My name is Dr. Mitchell Crawford, and I am the Director of 
Addiction Services for WellSpan Health. Subcommittee Chairman 
Guthrie and members of the House Energy and Commerce 
Subcommittee on Health, thank you very much for the opportunity 
to testify this morning.
    I would also like to particularly thank Dr. John Joyce, our 
Congressman here in Adams County, for his all-hands-on-deck 
approach to combat this addiction crisis.
    For background, WellSpan Health is an integrated delivery 
system of more than 20,000 team members serving the communities 
of central Pennsylvania, including WellSpan Gettysburg 
Hospital. Our behavioral health network, WellSpan Philhaven, is 
one of the 20th largest such providers in the Nation.
    The 115th Congress and the Trump administration deserve 
credit for the passage of the SUPPORT Act, which enabled 
hospitals to better coordinate care, expand access to substance 
use disorder (SUD) treatment, and offer alternative pain 
management treatments. The law reauthorized funding from the 
Cures Act, which put $500 million a year toward the opioid 
crisis and gave States more flexibility in using the funding. 
It expanded access to treatment addiction and increased 
penalties from drug manufacturers and distributors related to 
the overprescribing of opioids.
    The SUPPORT Act was an excellent start, but we have much 
more work to do.
    The number of adults in central Pennsylvania with 
behavioral health and substance use disorders is increasing and 
surpassing the capacity of behavioral health and primary care 
providers to treat them. Given the urgency of this addiction 
crisis, we cannot overstate the need to increase the number of 
healthcare providers who can treat individuals with addiction. 
Instead of driving people away from doing this work, we need to 
encourage them.
    We have already taken big steps. The DEA used to require 
clinicians who wanted to prescribe buprenorphine for the 
treatment of opioid use disorder to undergo an extensive 
training and registration process for the so-called ``X-
waiver.'' Although this was a revolutionary step in the right 
direction many years ago, in our current era the extra training 
and waiver process likely discouraged additional doctors from 
prescribing buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use 
disorder.
    Last December, Congress eliminated that provision, which we 
hope will increase access to treatment and literally prevent 
thousands of Americans from dying from opioid overdoses.
    Looking forward, as mentioned previously, one important 
barrier to eliminate would be the Institutions for Mental 
Diseases exclusion, or IMD, which has prohibited Federal 
payments to States for services for adult Medicaid 
beneficiaries between the ages of 21 and 64 who are treated in 
facilities that have more than 16 beds and that provide 
inpatient or residential behavioral health treatment.
    WellSpan appreciated the recent decision from the Drug 
Enforcement Agency and SAMHSA to release a temporary rule 
extending COVID-19 telehealth prescribing flexibilities for 
buprenorphine and other controlled substances through November 
11, 2024.
    As part of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, 
Congress directed the DEA to create a special registration 
program for telehealth providers. To date, no program has been 
established, and Congress should push the agency to meet its 
statutory mandate.
    On a related topic, Congress should make permanent Medicare 
telehealth flexibilities granted during the COVID-19 public 
health emergency and extended through 2024 by the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act.
    Keeping with the theme of flexibility, there is bipartisan 
legislation before this committee, Modernizing Opioid Treatment 
Access Act, that would increase access to lifesaving care for 
people experiencing opioid use disorder by reforming the 
outdated regulations governing the prescription and dispensing 
of methadone, largely--two crucial changes being that it would 
allow for prescription of methadone by physicians who are board 
certified in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry as well 
as pharmacies to dispense methadone under Federal oversight. We 
appreciate the subcommittee's review and consideration of this 
proposal.
    Finally, Congress should also double down on the commitment 
to fund the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic model. 
WellSpan's CCBHC, called the START Program, is an innovative, 
one-stop behavioral health treatment program for patients with 
a focus on rapid access and stabilization, in collaboration 
with numerous county agencies and community partners.
    I would like to close by bringing us back to what is most 
important. We know our friends and neighbors are struggling 
with addiction, and importantly, we know that treatment works.
    Thank you again to the members of the Subcommittee on 
Health for focusing your efforts on this critically important 
topic and for the opportunity to be here today. WellSpan looks 
forward to working with the committee and the entire Congress 
to ensure that all Americans have access to high-quality, 
lifesaving addiction healthcare services. Thank you, as well, 
for your service to the citizens of your districts, and I look 
forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Crawford follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. That is very powerful testimony as 
well.
    Chief Ceravola, you are recognized for 5 minutes for your 
opening statement.

                 STATEMENT OF WILLIAM CERAVOLA

    Mr. Ceravola. Thank you for the opportunity to be here 
today, Dr. Joyce.
    My name is William Ceravola. I was born and raised in New 
Orleans, Louisiana. I believe I had a normal childhood. Early 
on in life, I knew I wanted to get into law enforcement. I 
started working at a pizza shop when I was around 15 years old. 
Around that time, I started to associate with some coworkers 
that would help sneak me into a local bar and get me drinks and 
would also introduce me to marijuana.
    I had a relative that was a high-ranking trooper with the 
Louisiana State Police. I asked him what I needed to do to be a 
police officer, and he told me the best thing I could do at my 
age would be to join the military. So I did. In 1986, I went in 
the U.S. Army, and I loved every minute of serving until 1992, 
and probably would have made a career out of that, but my 
mission was to be a police officer.
    In 1995 I was hired by the Kenner Police Department in 
Louisiana. Of course, I started out as a patrolman and 
eventually worked to become a crime scene investigator. I 
remember when I graduated the police academy, I thought I could 
change the world--I might change some people's worlds, not all 
of them.
    But anyway, as a crime scene investigator I would 
investigate all types of crimes between vehicle break-in to 
investigating a triple homicide/kidnapping. But it was my job 
to collect evidence at death scenes, and I would regularly 
attend autopsies at the morgue. I had to collect evidence that 
the pathologist would discover, along with photographing and 
fingerprinting bodies.
    One day I went to the morgue, and I noticed that there was 
a pregnant female there. Little did I know at that time they 
also performed an autopsy on the fetus. I will never forget 
that little boy that never had a chance at life. It turns out 
that his mother passed of an overdose.
    I know there is a stigma with overdose deaths that it is 
their own fault, and it happens to other people, or they have 
had a poor upbringing. It cannot happen to smart, well-
educated, wealthy people, can it? Well, the female that day was 
a nurse, and she passed in a supply room in a hospital that she 
worked at. Think about that for a second. How can that be?
    Well, I have also seen police officers that get addicted to 
drugs. I personally had to dismiss an officer because he got 
addicted to painkillers from an off-duty injury. I wonder why 
did he not just come to me and say he had a problem. Well, I 
believe it is because he did not want to be labeled. I have 
also heard of police officers that are exposed at crime scenes, 
and someone has had to administer Narcan to save his or her 
life. I have been told that it could take only one time using 
some highly addictive drugs to get addicted. I worry that those 
officers became addicted that day.
    My police career in Louisiana was a very busy one. 
Sometimes I wonder how I can sleep at night. In December of 
2000, I decided that it would be best to move to East Berlin, 
Pennsylvania, and raise children. Reading Township is a farming 
community that is just outside of East Berlin here in Adams 
County. We have around 6,000 residents. When I started with the 
Reading Township Police Department, I was a police officer, and 
when the police chief left they selected me to be the officer 
in charge.
    When I first started here, I remember hearing about drug 
overdoses on a weekly event. Back then we did not have the 
computers in the cars, so we can't see all the calls. So I was 
just hearing what was over the radio when I was at work.
    At that time, we did not have Narcan in the cars. The best 
we could do was get to the scene and perform CPR, and it 
usually is in a hectic environment.
    In April 2004, my family had a life-altering event. My 
youngest brother, Byron, took his life. This weighed heavily on 
my mother, who already had a drinking problem and a failing 
marriage. Sadly, one of my other brothers turned to illegally 
taking pills to cope with our brother's passing. Later he 
started shooting up and eventually started using heroin.
    I knew my mother would never survive losing another son. I 
saw my mother struggle to assist him, and I was so mad that she 
would give him money and provide him a place to be able to use 
drugs. He would steal from her, but she said, ``I cannot stand 
to think of my son dying underneath a bridge in New Orleans 
from a drug overdose.'' He has been in rehab three times, and I 
can proudly say that he is doing excellent. He has a very good 
job now, take-home car, health benefits. He, of course, is on 
medication to help deal with his addiction. But what I worry 
about is, what is going to happen when my mother passes? Is 
that going to be a triggering event for him?
    Over the last 10 years, since I have been carrying Narcan 
in the car, I can honestly say that overdose deaths in my area 
have gone down. I do not see it on a weekly basis anymore, and 
I think being in a rural community, that has helped us a lot. I 
do not even know how many overdoses we do not know about, that 
the families are saving.
    So I pray that we can build on this success and save more 
lives. I can attest that we are not just saving the user, we 
are saving their family, because I have seen families crushed 
by overdose deaths.
    So I will wrap it up with, I still wonder about that little 
boy. What would he be today, 24 years later? What would he be 
doing today if he had a chance?
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Ceravola follows:]
   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you for that powerful testimony as well. 
And now we have concluded with witness statements, and we will 
begin questioning from members of the panel, and I will begin 
by recognizing myself for 5 minutes.
    And my first question will be to Chief Ceravola. I actually 
had jury duty a few years back. I got called by my local county 
and I was home in August, so I got to serve on jury duty. And I 
did grand jury, and we would hear 15 to 20 cases a day. And I 
just expected going in it was going to be all drugs. And there 
was certainly a good number of that, but what really shocked me 
is how much was alcohol. I mean, 0.3 with kids in the car, I 
mean, those kinds of things, domestic abuse, things of that 
nature. It just kind of shocked me how much is moving forward.
    Can you comment on the excessive alcohol use and 
alcoholism? I know you talked about your mother a little bit. 
In your enforcement, is alcohol as prevalent? Because the 
issues we get with the SUPPORT Act, you know, we absolutely 
have to deal with opioids, but there are other addictions 
people have as well, and I am thinking about how we need to 
deal with alcohol. Could you just kind of comment on how 
alcohol plays into this?
    Mr. Ceravola. Yes. I believe that alcohol is definitely a 
part of this. Like I said, I started out drinking some alcohol 
and it progressed into marijuana, and I am sure it could have 
kept going if I did not have that mission in life.
    More importantly, I think a lot of the problem is also 
mental health. Mental health, I think a lot of people who are 
on drugs, you have some mental health issues. Not everyone, of 
course. I can tell you that I have zero tolerance when it comes 
to alcohol. As a matter of fact, I guess 9, 10 years ago I got 
a phone call in the middle of the night, and it was a sheriff's 
deputy in Louisiana who said, ``We just arrested your mom for a 
DUI. What should we do?'' I said, ``Do your job.''
    My mom still gives me a hard time: ``You told them to 
arrest me?'' I said, ``No, you were already under arrest. I 
told them to do their job, because it was no sense in him 
losing his job because you made a mistake.''
    I am proud to say that I think that changed my mom's 
outlook, when I did not come to her rescue. She does not drink. 
Well, I think she will drink a wine here and there. She has 
found God again, and she is in a good place now. It took her a 
long time to get here.
    Mr. Guthrie. Good to hear the successes. And I think all of 
you, if we can keep our microphones kind of close. I think this 
is kind of a tough room in terms of echoes so please speak into 
your microphones. I know we can hear, but people behind you can 
hear better.
    Mr. Straley, you said your daughter lived in, I think, 14 
different--we are trying to figure out what works, and when we 
spend taxpayers' dollars how do we do it in the best way that 
it works and can help people.
    So is there any insight you can share on what your daughter 
went through? She had some months of sobriety and some things, 
and wraparound services at the end. What do you think worked, 
and when you said, ``Boy, this really was not a good option for 
my daughter,'' through her different treatments. What kind of 
treatment worked and what kind did not?
    Mr. Straley. When she was in California she actually 
received the best treatment, but I understand that was years 
ago. They were sort of ahead of the curve as far as medically 
assisted treatment. And, you know, she was out there in sober 
living in a group setting. When she was in sober-living homes 
where you were basically on your own, she struggled. She 
struggled to get to meetings. She struggled to interact. But it 
seemed like when they went together in groups, you know, the 
peers, the cohorts, that seemed to work.
    As far as other treatment, the Suboxone strips certainly 
worked for her. Other medically assisted--the shot, and things 
like that, I know that Ms. Keller talked about, those were 
things that did work for her.
    The biggest thing was getting back into the old 
surroundings and, you know, breaking that vicious chain. And 
once she found new friends in a sober-living environment, she 
thrived. But when she was out by herself, I know the chief 
talked about the mental health problem, that was an issue. 
There were struggles, and it seemed like she felt as though she 
was up against the world by herself.
    Mr. Guthrie. Dr. Crawford, I only have a few seconds, but 
Dr. Crawford and Ms. Keller, what do you see as a couple of 
things that are successful, and what we can improve?
    Dr. Crawford. Yes, I will be quick so you have an 
opportunity to speak as well.
    Opportunities, I think, are increasing low-barrier access 
to treatment, just making it as easy as possible for folks to 
engage in treatment, and to kind of change culture. We have 
heard comments about stigma, which I greatly appreciated and 
agree with. So making an opportunity for folks to kind of 
normalize that conversation, to feel comfortable to have it, 
and then being ready to act when they ask for help.
    Mr. Guthrie. Ms. Keller?
    Ms. Keller. I agree with low-barrier access to treatment, 
medically assisted treatment, and also wrapround services. So 
we are not putting someone in a 28-day program and saying, 
``OK, here you go. Go about your day.'' We need to wrap around 
services, make sure they have financial literacy training, they 
have access to MOUD when they get out, they have Medicaid or 
primary care benefits, just an ability to thrive, and we are 
not just expecting someone to be cured in 28 days.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. Thank you for testifying. I will 
yield back, and I will now recognize Mr. Tonko for 5 minutes 
for questions.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Chair, and thank you again to all of 
our witnesses. We have seen this in many of our family members 
and friends and neighbors. Our justice system is a revolving 
door for those struggling with addiction and mental health 
issues. Over one-half of people in State prisons and two-thirds 
of individuals in jails have substance use disorder. The need 
for uninterrupted and comprehensive coverage for individuals 
prior to release from incarceration has never been more 
critical, and the inability of Medicaid to cover otherwise 
eligible individuals has unintentionally stood in the way, 
creating burdens for law enforcement and obstacles for 
individuals who need care. And again, so many of our loved ones 
end up in an incarcerated setting.
    Currently Federal statute prohibits any form of Federal 
health coverage for incarcerated individuals except under very 
limited circumstances. In most cases, Medicaid coverage is 
immediately terminated when someone is sent to a correctional 
setting. This creates a serious coverage gap when individuals 
are released, as they often have no access to healthcare or 
addiction treatment during a stressful and dangerous time.
    Ms. Keller, thank you for your commitment to promoting 
access to care in honor of your friend, Ashley, and the many 
loved ones we have lost to this disease. You mentioned that in 
particular you have seen incarcerated individuals struggle with 
a lack of access to care coordination upon their release. Can 
you speak more to why the period post-incarceration is such a 
critical time to receive treatment and coordination of care?
    Ms. Keller. Absolutely. We are actually seeing that people 
being released from jail are up to 128 times more likely to die 
from an overdose in the 2 weeks following their release. My 
friend, Ashley, died from an overdose 6 weeks after her 
release. It is a very real thing.
    If returning citizens were able to have access to 
healthcare immediately, it could be a game changer. Think about 
this: You go into jail, you have a substance use disorder, you 
are not treated in jail; when you get out, you still have that 
substance use disorder. So if you are able to immediately 
access healthcare benefits it could really change recidivism 
rates and what we are seeing. Overdose deaths are actually the 
fastest-growing cause of deaths that are occurring in U.S. 
jails as well.
    So we need to treat the person. Yes, if they committed a 
crime and they are serving a sentence, they are still a human 
being and they still have a disease that needs to be treated.
    Mr. Tonko. So to clarify: Currently can most incarcerated 
individuals access medications for opioid use disorder while 
they are incarcerated?
    Ms. Keller. No, they cannot.
    Mr. Tonko. OK. Thanks to the bipartisan work this committee 
did together 5 years ago in the SUPPORT Act, States can now 
apply for a demonstration program to use Medicaid for eligible 
services for justice-involved individuals returning to their 
communities, 90 days prerelease. While this demonstration 
program is wonderful, it is just that: a demo. It can be ripped 
away at any moment and will require both applications from the 
State and approval by CMS. I have made the case to my 
colleagues that we should protect and codify this demonstration 
program through my Reentry Act. Some are worried about the 
Federal costs, but I strongly believe that this is one of the 
most effective ways we can save lives through a relatively 
small change in policy.
    Let me reiterate: I measure success in lives saved and 
families kept whole. By allowing inmates to receive addiction 
treatment and other services before returning home, my Reentry 
Act will bring targeted treatment to those at the highest risk 
of overdose.
    Ms. Keller, again, do you believe that reentry policy such 
as access to prerelease services, including SUD services, for 
otherwise eligible individuals is a good use of Federal 
funding?
    Ms. Keller. Yes, Representative. I do not think you can put 
a price tag on a human life, and if our tax dollars are going 
to save to allow that person to thrive, then I think that it is 
absolutely worth it.
    Mr. Tonko. Some of the most vocal advocates for the Reentry 
Act that I have authored and the need for prerelease addiction 
services and coordination of care are law enforcement, because 
they see firsthand how this disease of addiction impacts their 
community. I would like to enter for the record a joint letter 
in support of my Reentry Act from the National Sheriff's 
Association, the Major County Sheriffs of America, the Major 
Cities Chiefs Association, and the National Association of 
Counties.
    Mr. Guthrie. Without objection, so ordered.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you. And Chief Ceravola, some people 
believe that justice-involved individuals are not worthy of 
treatment or saving or have the mindset that perhaps they do 
not deserve treatment or at least a lost cause. Further, they 
think of those with addiction as less. I want to personally 
thank you for reducing stigma but most of all for seeking 
humanity in others.
    What would you say to other law enforcement members who may 
be considering carrying Narcan?
    Mr. Ceravola. I have actually had some law enforcement 
officers tell me they are not going to bother, that person did 
it to themselves. And I explain to them, ``You need to do that 
because, one, it could be your coworker that was affected, but 
more importantly, you are saving that person's family, not the 
user. You are giving the user another chance, but you are 
saving the family.''
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you. With that I yield back, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. The gentleman yields back. The 
Chair will recognize Mr. Griffith for 5 minutes, for the 
purpose of asking questions.
    Mr. Griffith. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
    Mr. Straley, you said that your daughter benefited from 
some Suboxone programs, which is buprenorphine. When she was 
not in the program, was she able to access Suboxone on the 
street, do you know?
    Mr. Straley. I do not know. I want to say no.
    Mr. Griffith. And I am going to shift. I just wanted that 
as a fact point, because in part of my district--I have a large 
rural district in Appalachia, and in part of my district 
there's a number of Suboxone clinics, and what they have found 
is that it has become a street drug that some of the patients 
who are there will take some of their dosage and they will sell 
some of their dosage.
    So Dr. Crawford, have you seen any signs of that with your 
patients, where some of them may not be taking the full dosage, 
and what do you do to monitor if people are actually taking 
what you have prescribed them? I assume you prescribe Suboxone 
because you mentioned buprenorphine.
    Dr. Crawford. Correct, yes, I do prescribe medications for 
the treatment of addiction. And so to more directly answer your 
question, yes, I have had patients who I suspected of diverting 
the medications that I prescribed. To be very clear, you know, 
we take a harm reduction approach and a low-barrier access to 
care, but we are also not drug dealers, right, so we have to 
keep people safe, and we have to reduce their risk of harm. So 
in those circumstances it is very clear from folks like the 
Drug Enforcement Agency that we could not continue that 
relationship. That was a clear mark that either this treatment 
is not effective for them, perhaps they may need a higher level 
of care, more support wrapped around them, and so we would not 
continue to go just as ----
    Mr. Griffith. If you picked it up. And I am going to come 
back to that in a second.
    Chief, have you seen any--and I will use the doctor's 
term--``diversion'' of Suboxone or buprenorphine in your 
community?
    Mr. Ceravola. I personally have not. I do know that my 
brother is on Suboxone and that he has to go through a clinic 
to get his dosage. I do not know if they get it all before you 
leave or if it--is it a pill you take a day? I do not know how 
it really works.
    Mr. Griffith. All right. So let's go back to the patients 
that are doing what they are supposed to do on this, and one of 
the worries that I have, and why I worry about not having some 
limitation on how many patients that somebody has on 
buprenorphine, is that they may not be paying as close 
attention as you are to whether or not there is a diversion.
    But let's go to the ones who are not diverting. Do you ever 
get them off of the Suboxone? I mean, I know of one case, in 
Maryland, where a friend of mine's son had this issue and went 
to them and said, ``Start weaning me off.'' It took years, but 
he eventually got off and is doing great. But do you see that 
in your practice, or do we get them to just where they are 
stable and they continue to take the substitute opioid, 
Suboxone, or buprenorphine?
    Dr. Crawford. Yes. Thank you for the question. And just to 
clarify, you know, nothing we do in medicine is perfect, 
unfortunately.
    Mr. Griffith. Oh definitely, yes.
    Dr. Crawford. And so ----
    Mr. Griffith. And clearly nothing we do in Congress is 
perfect, but you have got a better batting average than we do. 
But I do appreciate that, but yes.
    Dr. Crawford. Sure. And so, you know, we accept that there 
is some risk, and we are always balancing the risk and the 
benefit analysis. And so you heard the majority of folks--90, 
95 percent of people aged 12 and older, depending on which 
dataset you are looking at--do not have access to treatment or 
are not engaged. And so that is a risk that we take, that 
perhaps some folks, a small minority, may be diverting. We do 
not want that to happen, and we act accordingly.
    We also know from the literature that the medication that 
is diverted is actually going, the majority of the time, to 
folks who do not have access. So it should not happen that way, 
and we do not want it to happen that way, but that is where we 
think the majority of that medication is actually going.
    And to more directly answer your question, you know, we are 
talking about a chronic medical disease, similar to other 
chronic medical diseases like type 2 diabetes or hypertension 
or high blood pressure. And these are things that folks have 
that they may take medications for for the rest of their life, 
or these are things that they may have changes in their life or 
changes in their bodies that they may not need to take 
medication anymore.
    So I always counsel folks and treat my patients accordingly 
with we are going to do with what works right now. If that 
means we are going to take medication for the rest of our lives 
because that is what works and that is what keeps you alive and 
healthy, then that is great. If you feel like you want to 
taper, we can do so, but very slowly and for the right reasons.
    Mr. Griffith. And that is why I said it took years. You 
cannot just do it overnight or you get into worse trouble. And 
I do appreciate that. So you have had some patients who have 
tapered and gotten off of Suboxone or buprenorphine?
    Dr. Crawford. Yes. Yes.
    Mr. Griffith. OK, good.
    Ms. Keller, I am going to switch to you and slightly change 
subjects. Part of the SUPPORT Act had a section in it on drug 
monitoring. Those were sections that I advocate because, like 
the arm of Maryland, my district stretches out and goes from 
the Lynchburg/Roanoke area down to an area that is so far west, 
it is further west than Detroit, Michigan, and we touch a 
number of different States, and you can actually get 
prescriptions in five different States. Maryland has a similar 
situation with its arm, and I am just curious if you all have 
had success with a drug monitoring program. Does that seem to 
have stopped the illegal use of getting multiple prescriptions 
from different doctors in different States, or even in 
Maryland? Have you seen some success with that?
    Ms. Keller. We have seen success with the prescription drug 
monitoring program, and where I am on the map, where Maryland 
gets very small, we had the same issue. So yes, it has been 
successful.
    Mr. Griffith. And so while everything we do does not work 
perfectly, every now and then Congress gets one right, and I 
think that SUPPORT Act was one of those.
    I yield back. Thank you.
    Mr. Guthrie. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes Dr. Bucshon for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr. Bucshon. Thank you all for your testimony. I was a 
surgeon before I was in Congress, and a healthcare provider. I 
do not have any direct experience with substance abuse, but I 
have family and friends who have had mental health issues. It 
is a different but similar problem--chronic, lifelong problem.
    Dr. Crawford, I mean, if there was one thing that we could 
do, what would it be?
    Dr. Crawford. A great question.
    Mr. Bucshon. I mean, you are the professional in this. I 
mean, you do this every day. And is there one thing that every 
day you go, ``Boy, if we could just do this, that would make a 
difference''? Is there such a thing?
    Dr. Crawford. It is hard to pin down one thing because the 
disease of addiction is multifactorial. I mean, there are so 
many causes and there are so many diverse kind of treatment 
pathways for folks. But I think continuing to have these 
conversations and continuing to have an open mind to what the 
experts are sharing with you and where the evidence is leading 
you to help make decisions about grant opportunities and 
funding pathways and recommendations for alternative payment 
methods to encourage us to just be a healthier community rather 
than focusing on efforts that are more reactive once harm has 
happened.
    Mr. Bucshon. Yes. I am interested in the subject about law 
enforcement because, obviously, my county jail in Evansville, 
Indiana, Vanderburgh County, has a high incidence of both 
mental health and substance abuse people who are imprisoned 
there. And I talk to my county sheriffs about that, and I am 
empathetic to the situation as it relates to the Medicaid 
program and figuring out ways to address that so that we do not 
have gaps in care.
    There is a huge cost to it. We are trying to figure that 
out. But I do think--and I will just speak for myself--that we 
have to sort that out, particular people, if they were on 
Medicaid before, and then they lose it while they are 
imprisoned, and then they come out, you know, and I think we 
have addressed some of that, the reapplication process and all 
that. We are going to sort that out.
    Chief, in your area, in this area it is rural America--I 
represent rural America--where are the illicit drugs coming 
from?
    Mr. Ceravola. I hate to name just one city, but in my area 
I believe lot of it is coming from Baltimore. I have also been 
seeing some coming from the York area. But I think most of that 
is coming through Baltimore.
    Mr. Bucshon. Yes, and one thing, when we are talking about 
substance abuse, I do not want to overlook--and I will talk to 
you about this--we are not past the methamphetamine problem, 
are we?
    Mr. Ceravola. No.
    Mr. Bucshon. If you were to look at what is the most common 
thing that you find people have problems with in your rural 
area, what drug would that be?
    Mr. Ceravola. Right now I believe it is heroin.
    Mr. Bucshon. Heroin.
    Mr. Ceravola. Yes.
    Mr. Bucshon. So you are closer to an urban area than I am. 
I am about 3 hours from Indianapolis, but we have a huge meth 
problem still. You know, we do not make it anymore locally, but 
now it comes from primarily Mexico. It comes through Chicago, 
down to Indy, down to us.
    And Doctor, I am going to ask you this question because I 
know with methamphetamine, you know, they have done brain 
studies on this, and it shows if you are on methamphetamine 
that your brain may not change, even if you get off of it, for 
years. I mean, there are scientific studies that show this, and 
that is what makes is so hard for people to quit, because their 
brain still craves this stuff. It is like nicotine. In the 
medical field we call it upregulation of receptors or something 
in the tissue, right? Is that type of thing also--I mean, I am 
not aware of that type of chronic brain changes when it comes 
to things like heroin or cocaine or these other drugs.
    Do you know if there is any specific reason why long-term 
treatment like somebody pointed out, you cannot expect people 
to recover in 90 days, right, and why it is so important to 
have long-term followup and long-term care? There are 
physiologic changes in people that they cannot overcome just by 
thinking about it. Is that true?
    Dr. Crawford. That is a great question, and it actually 
kind of connects to the question you first asked me about that 
kind of silver bullet, which is the recognition that, you know, 
we have an addiction epidemic and probably behavioral health 
epidemic. And there is a mosaic of what is actually being used 
throughout our State and our country. In the west part of our 
country, there is a lot more stimulant misuse. In the 
northeast, there is a lot more opioid misuse. And we have FDA-
approved medications to treat opioid use disorder. We do not 
have FDA-approved medications to treat stimulant use disorder. 
And so that is one of the big differences.
    To more directly answer your question, yes, we do see brain 
changes in folks that are suffering from addiction. A lot of 
that is reinforcement of pathways, and I will not bore you with 
all the neurobiology.
    Mr. Bucshon. I hated neurobiology, by the way, in medical 
school. It just was not my thing.
    Yes, I mean, I think that is something--and I will finish 
up here, Mr. Chairman--that we really need to understand, and 
we have talked about this. The stigma needs to go away as much 
as possible because there are legitimate medical, physiological 
changes in people who become addicted that we have to recognize 
and that we have to find medical ways to get them out of it. 
And just telling them, ``Hey, it is bad to use drugs'' just 
does not help.
    I yield.
    Mr. Guthrie. The gentleman yields back. The Chair 
recognizes Dr. Joyce for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you again, Chair Guthrie.
    Mr. Straley, thanks for appearing here and offering such 
incredibly powerful testimony. I offer to you personally, and 
to your wife Robin, condolences for your loss. Both you and 
Robin are working in our community, and it has been exemplary 
work, which allows you to share your experiences in an area 
that is so critical. What you have messaged to us today is a 
message that we will return to Washington with.
    But I want to ask you to address to us, as far as 
legislation that would inform us to make better Federal policy 
and face those who are in addiction. Specifically you touched 
on a point that I think is so important for those of us who 
live in rural areas, that those facing addiction in rural 
areas, which is why your daughter traveled far from this 
beautiful community--for those who face those addiction issues 
here, it has to be addressed through a different lens or 
perhaps through many different lenses. Do you feel that access 
to care in rural areas is sufficient?
    Mr. Straley. No, I do not.
    Mr. Joyce. Do you feel that we should be more attentive to 
understanding how important that access is, and should that be 
included in the SUPPORT Act?
    Mr. Straley. Absolutely.
    Mr. Joyce. Chief Ceravola, opioid overdose reversal 
medications like naloxone, you and I recognize, are critical 
components to part of the strategy. As you face each and every 
day as you are called out on each and every call, often you 
might not know if you are going to have to utilize the ability 
to reverse an overdose.
    According to the Reagan-Udall Foundation, a recent report 
on naloxone, of the 17 million doses of naloxone that have been 
distributed in the United States in 2021, more than 84 percent 
were distributed by local health departments, first responders 
like you, schools, and other community organizations.
    Can you share how important, once again for us, that law 
enforcement and first responders are in having that access to 
naloxone in your cruiser?
    Mr. Ceravola. I believe it is very important. I make sure 
that each one of my police cars has at least one dosage. I 
think we should have it readily available to anybody who wants 
it. If somebody walks into my station and says, ``I would like 
a dose,'' I would be more than happy to give them mine and go 
get another one.
    Another positive thing I have seen lately is in the last 
couple years we have went through a paid EMS in my area. Prior 
to that, it was all volunteer. So now we are getting ambulances 
to the scene quicker, so that is another avenue for that Narcan 
to be administered. Sometimes the ambulance can beat us to the 
scene now, which used to not be the case.
    Actually, one of the things that I did when my brother 
passed is I put my energy into building a street rod. This past 
week there was a street rod show in York, and I drove it in the 
parade through York. And as I am driving along I see a lady 
sitting with a table in a corner, and she has a whole bunch of 
boxes of Narcan sitting on that table. It was an outreach 
program.
    I wanted to pull over and hug her, but I could not stop the 
parade, and we ended up taking a different route back. But I 
really wanted to stop and talk to that person, but I did not 
get a chance to. I think things like that help. And here she is 
just sitting out there on a sunny day with a table full of 
Narcan for anybody that wants to come get it.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Chief, and thank you, Dr. Crawford. 
Thank you for bringing your expertise to rural Pennsylvania. 
Access to comprehensive treatment for opioid or any drug 
addiction, we have recognized from your testimony, is 
incredibly challenging. And again, I go back to how challenging 
that is in rural areas here in Pennsylvania 13.
    So when we are talking about significant barriers that are 
driving the lack of access, do you feel that the IMD exclusion 
is an important barrier that we need to address in our upcoming 
SUPPORT legislation?
    Dr. Crawford. I do, yes.
    Mr. Joyce. Within your WellSpan facility, how many 
inpatients do you treat at different facilities, and locally 
and comprehensively in all the facilities where your treatment 
is?
    Dr. Crawford. Are you referring to strictly for behavioral 
health?
    Mr. Joyce. Yes, in behavioral health, clearly.
    Dr. Crawford. I do not have the exact figures. We have a 
number of hospitals. We have a stand-alone behavioral health 
hospital in Lebanon County. We have an inpatient unit in 
Lancaster County as well as in Franklin County and others. So 
at least hundreds, perhaps even low thousands of patients.
    Mr. Joyce. Do you feel that physicians having additional 
opportunity and not being limited to the number of patients 
they can prescribe Suboxone--do you find that is an important 
piece of equipment that a physician is going to have as they 
are armed appropriately to treat addiction?
    Dr. Crawford. I do, yes.
    Mr. Joyce. My time has expired, and I yield.
    Mr. Guthrie. The gentleman yields back. The Chair 
recognizes Mr. Obernolte from California for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Obernolte. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you very 
much to our witnesses. This has been an incredibly poignant 
hearing for me. I represent an extremely rural section of 
California. You would not think that my district would be a 
district that would have a problem with fentanyl, but we do. In 
the last 18 months, my district has experienced an over 600 
percent increase in the number of fentanyl-related deaths, 
which is incredible.
    My most difficult day in 19 years of public office was last 
fall when I had a constituent lose both of her sons in the same 
afternoon to the same fentanyl poisoning incident. So this is a 
problem that has its tentacles in every part of our country, 
and it is something that I am convinced that government, and in 
particular Congress, needs to play an active role in fixing.
    I want to talk about a couple of kind of difficult topics, 
and one of them is I wish we would stop using the word 
``overdose.'' The vast majority of these incidences, when 
someone dies from fentanyl, is not an overdose. It is a 
poisoning. They did not intend to take fentanyl--not to defend 
the fact that they thought it was oxy or some other opioid--but 
this substance was intentionally introduced into a pill that 
they took, and they did not have the knowledge of what they 
were taking.
    As has been discussed here, Narcan has been a godsend, and 
it has meaningfully decreased the number of fentanyl-related 
deaths in my community as we have gotten it into more schools, 
more law enforcement. Unfortunately, we are seeing a new 
problem in my district, which is the problem of xylazine. 
Xylazine does not respond to Narcan, and we do not have a way 
right now of saving someone who is suffering from xylazine 
poisoning. That problem is just going to increasingly get 
worse.
    Chief Ceravola, I would like to ask you, with your law 
enforcement experience, there is a fundamental difference here 
between preventing opioids like oxycodone from being in our 
community, because there is a legitimate prescription path for 
that. So a lot of the oxy that we see diverted is diverted from 
someone who has a legitimate prescription, or it comes from 
overprescription through legitimate channels.
    But fentanyl and xylazine, that is a completely different 
thing. You would think that if we could get that off the 
street, yes, we would still have a problem with substance use 
and opioid use, but we would not have nearly as many people 
actually dying from it.
    So what can we do more to get substances like fentanyl and 
xylazine off the street?
    Mr. Ceravola. I guess the best thing to do is more 
enforcement and get the courts to work with us, because so many 
times we see somebody get off on things, and it is like that is 
something that the person should pay the price for. You know, 
that is a dealer providing these drugs to the community. That 
person should not get a light sentence.
    Mr. Obernolte. So you are suggesting sentence enhancement 
for crimes like intentional incorporation of fentanyl into a 
pill.
    Mr. Ceravola. Right. One of the things we always try to do 
at a death scene is we will try to seize the phone. A lot of 
times we can go through that phone and see who the provider 
was, and then we can go after that person. In a most recent 
case, when I did get to that point, by the time I figured out 
who it was, he had also passed away.
    I do notice that there must be some bad batches that come 
in sometimes, because you will see a spike. Like everybody must 
have gotten some of this bad batch of heroin. I do not know. 
That is the only way I can figure out how you can have a spike, 
like a week, and then it will go right down. It has to be just 
a bad batch.
    Mr. Obernolte. Right. In speaking with my own local law 
enforcement, they have found that often the local dealers are 
unaware that fentanyl has been introduced into what they think 
they are pressing into oxy pills, and it is actually the 
higher-up links in that drug supply chain that have that 
knowledge. But I completely agree with you.
    Mr. Ceravola. I can believe that.
    Mr. Obernolte. Well, I think we are going to do another 
round of questioning so I will save my next questions to the 
going-over time. But thank you very much for your testimony.
    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. Mr. Tonko, we have gone pretty 
efficient with our time, so we will go around and let everybody 
ask an additional question. Everybody does not have to use 
their 5 minutes each time, or a closing statement, or just an 
additional question. So I will recognize myself for 5 minutes.
    And I just want to say that we are going to all work 
together. This is going to be a bipartisan issue going forward. 
It does not mean we are going to agree on everything, so we are 
going to work through those disagreements. We are not going to 
disagree to be disagreeable.
    And one thing, there are a lot of proposals to expand 
Medicaid, and we want people in prison to get the help and the 
coverage and assistant they need because it is cheaper on 
society as they move forward, as they move out, to not be 
recidivism. We did pass a bill last year that allows juveniles 
to have access to their Medicaid healthcare, mental health 
treatment, because as you said, that is going to be helpful 
moving forward.
    We just want to be careful that--I used to be in the State 
legislature. State legislators have to balance their budgets, 
thank goodness, and nothing they would like more than to send 
the cost up to Washington, DC. And there is a responsibility 
for the States in this. I know that Maryland does a great job 
with it. Kentucky does a great job with it. There is a 
responsibility for States and local governments. And as we have 
to deal with ever-increasing budget deficits, the solution of 
sending the bill to Washington is not the best.
    And like you said, we make decisions that do things like we 
did with mental health in juveniles, because that worked, and 
we think it would be effective and save money in the long run. 
But we just want to be careful as we move forward on the policy 
we move, and we will work through any differences. I have 
confidence it will be a strong bill that will be bipartisan and 
be able to be supported.
    I will yield back and recognize my good friend from New 
York, Mr. Tonko.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just a couple of 
questions.
    Ms. Keller, you made reference to evidence-based harm 
reduction. What does that look like, and what is the benefit of 
using those approaches?
    Ms. Keller. So harm reduction is using evidence-based 
solutions that can aim to reduce the harm that substance use 
causes. So this provides linkages to care. It also gets people 
in touch with a peer support specialist. A peer support 
specialist is someone who has lived experience, who can talk 
the talk and walk the walk. A lot of times it involves a 
syringe service program, which provides clean syringes that 
lower the spread of things like HIV and hepatitis C, which does 
not just help the person with a substance use disorder, it also 
helps public health in general.
    The interesting thing is some people, there were theories 
that harm reduction may enable. But the reality of it is people 
who are enrolled in a harm reduction program are five times 
more likely to enter treatment, because they have been treated 
with dignity and respect, they have a relationship with their 
peer support specialist, and when that person says, ``You know 
what? I am ready. This is the day that I want to go,'' they 
know that they can go to their harm reduction program and be 
trusted and access the care that they need.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you. I might just ask, Mr. Straley, in 
regard to Leah, and, you know, Dr. Joyce had asked about the 
approachability or availability of services in rural areas. 
Would the addition of those who can prescribe medication-
assisted treatment been a helpful thing for Leah ----
    Mr. Straley. Absolutely.
    Mr. Tonko [continuing]. Adding more people to those roles?
    Mr. Straley. Yes.
    Mr. Tonko. You know, Doctor, you made mention of some of 
the reforms that we have done with MAT, and I was proud to 
really push that effort. Some people have said to me, ``Well, 
getting the bill passed is 50 percent of the journey.'' I think 
in this case it might be 10 percent, because implementation 
here requires the entire community, from pharmaceutical 
companies to pharmacies, doctors, nurses, clinicians, to be 
entering into that equation.
    How can we best encourage people you are giving work to 
enter into that service provider status?
    Dr. Crawford. Yes. You are right, it is an opportunity for 
us, as healthcare delivery systems and providers, to meet the 
communities where they are at is a problem. And I think a lot 
of it we have talked about in this committee today about stigma 
and making it something that the health systems and local 
independent providers and such actually view as a medical 
disease and something they feel armed and competent to treat.
    So as much as we can do to continue to talk about it, raise 
awareness about it, and continue the great work you all are 
doing to reduce barriers, to allow people to do it and give 
them access to training to feel comfortable and confident.
    Mr. Tonko. In DEA's own words, they indicated that today we 
have about 135,000 folks that can prescribe under a medication-
assisted treatment scenario. With the bill that we passed in 
Congress, they said the potential is there for 1.83 million, 
and it is going to take interacting with the communities that 
can provide the service. So whatever you can do to advise us 
going forward, or whatever encouragement you can provide to 
your peers, that would be appreciated.
    And with that, I yield back. Thank you.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you for yielding, the gentleman 
yielding. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Griffith for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Griffith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me just say I 
agree with the Chairman that this problem is so awful with 
substance abuse, it affects so many people that we are all 
working together. We do not always agree on what the solution 
is, but as you can tell from the tenor of our questions today 
and our comments here, this is not a politically divided issue. 
It is just a question of how can we best do it in the most 
appropriate way that we can and figure out what we are doing.
    We will stumble along. And as we talked earlier, Dr. 
Crawford, we will make mistakes, and the medical community will 
make mistakes, and hopefully we will figure out how to fix it 
and do the best that we can moving forward.
    With all that being said, Dr. Crawford, I am just 
wondering, how do you treat differently, or what do you do 
differently, and have you seen--I am sure you have--fentanyl, 
but also the fentanyl analogs and now xylazine. Have you 
treated somebody who been using the xylazine? It is relatively 
new. I am just curious.
    Dr. Crawford. Yes, absolutely and unfortunately. And so 
when you have fentanyl and fentanyl analogs that we see as well 
now, that are even more potent or stronger, some things that 
change are that you may need more than one treatment with 
naloxone, for example. I have had folks where we used all the 
naloxone we had on hand, and we actually were waiting for the 
code cart to get to us so that we could push the medication 
intravenously or intramuscularly. They just were not responding 
intranasally.
    So when you are dealing with these sorts of new classes of 
potency or strength of these substances, it is a new challenge. 
We also see a phenomenon like was described previously, where 
fentanyl is so deadly not only because of the potency but also 
because it has a profound effect on what we call chest wall 
rigidity, in that it actually makes your chest tighten and even 
harder for you to breathe even if you had a little impulse from 
your body to keep breathing.
    So there are new things that we see that come with the new 
substances. Xylazine, we are seeing really profound wounds all 
over the body--it does not have to be at the injection site--
that need to be treated in different ways. We have seen folks 
with amputations from these wounds. And as you are describing, 
we do not know the best ways to treat these things medically 
yet. There is not enough time and evidence to support it, so we 
are doing our best to treat it symptomatically and keep folks 
alive.
    Mr. Griffith. All right. You raised all kinds of questions 
for me. One, what is shocking, the wounds from xylazine. Are 
they self-inflicted, or is it that they do not feel the pain so 
they get injured accidentally, or is it something that they are 
doing as a part of the reaction to the drug?
    Dr. Crawford. Yes, it is a reaction to the substance. And 
we think what is likely happening is that this substance, 
xylazine, causes essentially clamping of the blood vessels 
throughout the body, and that is why we can see it in places 
other than where someone may be injecting. And what happens is 
that the tissue will die, and it dies from essentially deeper 
levels and then out. So it is different than a wound you may 
see that starts as a skin infection and then goes down. So 
folks need to be trained to look for this all over the body and 
then comfortable in how they actually treat this different type 
of wound.
    Mr. Griffith. And then the other question that your 
previous comment raised, we have all seen the studies and 
reports, but when somebody is taking fentanyl or fentanyl 
analog and you are trying to do the naloxone or Narcan, which 
is another common name for the same substance, and you all are 
pushing it in. What that indicates to me is that, when Chief 
Ceravola finds this happening on the street, he has got no way 
of knowing how much Narcan he should give--or his officers, 
they have no way of knowing how much Narcan they should give 
without giving them to somebody like you who is an expert. Is 
that a fair statement?
    Dr. Crawford. It is fair to say that, yes. I think what we 
always guide folks, and when we talk with our excellent folks 
on the front lines in the first responder field, is do what you 
can with what you have and try to stabilize folks. What we can 
do is we can breathe for folks. We can do CPR. We can try to 
keep them alive and as viable as possible to make it to the 
next step, which is where we have all the intensive treatment 
where we can intubate and put tubes in to help them breathe and 
do all the next-level medical care.
    Mr. Griffith. But because these substances are relatively 
new, not always predictable, particularly with the analogs or 
with the xylazine, both you and the frontline people in many 
cases are just having to experiment and hope you get it right. 
Is that a fair statement as well? Is that true?
    Dr. Crawford. We follow the evidence when it is there.
    Mr. Griffith. I understand.
    Dr. Crawford. And when it is something new, we treat 
symptomatically and do our best to keep them alive.
    Mr. Griffith. But if it is not working, you are going to go 
a little bit further in hopes that it does work. Correct?
    Dr. Crawford. Yes. We would not give up, for sure.
    Mr. Griffith. I yield back.
    Dr. Crawford. Thank you.
    Mr. Guthrie. The gentleman yields back. The Chair 
recognizes Dr. Bucshon.
    Mr. Bucshon. Thank you. I just want to get on the record on 
the fentanyl. It is coming from China, to Mexico, through 
cartels, to the United States of America, killing our citizens. 
That is not my opinion. That is what is happening. So I am 
speaking to the fentanyl itself.
    So, you know, all of us at the Federal level not only were 
looking at preventing people from using it or the demand for 
drugs by helping people get off of illicit drugs and treat 
them, but we are also looking on the supply side. I just wanted 
to put that on the record.
    You know, the question is, how do we address that? We are 
trying to address the fentanyl analog situation and making the 
current administration scheduling the fentanyl analogs 
permanent, because believe it or not, the scientists in China--
primarily China--chemists will literally change one little 
molecule on the fentanyl, and then it technically may not be 
illegal in the United States, and they can actually bring it 
into the United States legally, unless we have fentanyl analogs 
scheduled as Schedule I, which means there is no medicinal use. 
It would be like heroin and other things. I just wanted to put 
that on the record.
    Dr. Crawford, this is a chronic disease, right?
    Dr. Crawford. Correct.
    Mr. Bucshon. And would you say in the majority of cases you 
would not use the term ``cured'' in these cases, like you 
would, say, for some other mental health?
    Dr. Crawford. Correct. We tend to refer to folks as being 
in recovery.
    Mr. Bucshon. In recovery, yes. I want to point that out.
    So I think also, what are your thoughts on not only 
medication-assisted treatment, which I am a big supporter of, 
by the way, and those things, but ongoing so-called wraparound 
therapy, ongoing engagement with people who are in recovery, 
and how important that is also. Could you comment on that?
    Dr. Crawford. Yes. So first, I am a psychiatrist who then 
specialized in the treatment of addictions, so of course I 
believe in therapy and support of all of the other services 
that wrap around folks.
    I think it is important, and I know you are not suggesting 
this, but to recognize that the medications themselves, or 
certain parts of it themselves, can be very powerful alone as 
well.
    Mr. Bucshon. Yes.
    Dr. Crawford. And so it could be dangerous to suggest that, 
you know, it has to be this for a certain person and list all 
the components. We recognize that the gold standard for 
treatment of opioid use disorder is medication-assisted 
treatment, and then we offer everything else and share what the 
benefits are. But we should not withhold certain parts of 
treatment because the person is not interested in other 
elements.
    Mr. Bucshon. Agreed. I mean, as a physician I think, I 
mean, there is pretty good evidence to show--and my dad had an 
alcohol problem for a while, and he ended up kicking it--that 
this is a chronic problem and that medication-assisted 
treatment, if you are talking about weaning people off of it 
and all of these things, I just personally believe that people 
have to be, for their lifetime, engaged in some way in the 
treatment system, whatever that may be. Otherwise, like you 
pointed out, Chief, where what might happen to your mother and 
her alcohol problem if her other son died. You know, there can 
be triggers that people have in their life, and suddenly, even 
though they are doing well and they are in recovery, something 
could trigger them, and they could flip back if they do not 
have someone to reach out to.
    I mean, would you agree with that?
    Dr. Crawford. I think that is where the low-barrier access 
comes in. So there is always an open door, and there is no 
wrong door, is eventually what we would like to get to. So in 
that moment, someone may have been in recovery for 10 years, 
had not used the substance, and they had a slip, a return to 
use. Knowing exactly where to go, or at least who to point them 
in the right direction, and then us welcoming them with open 
arms, with no judgment, is really what I think would be most 
beneficial.
    Mr. Bucshon. How do we keep track of those people so we 
know? Say they do not come to you for 5 years. I mean, are 
there programs where we proactively have reach-out programs, 
where we just touch base with people proactively from a 
provider perspective?
    Dr. Crawford. It is a great idea. I am sure that there are 
some community organizations that do that. We also know that 
there are great models, like 12-step programs, for example, 
that folks stay engaged in for decades, maybe their whole 
lives. Medically speaking, with a medical model, I do not see 
that very often, but I think there could be value in that.
    Mr. Bucshon. And with your indulgence, Mr. Chairman, I want 
to ask the Chief one thing. How many people are you seeing that 
are getting Narcan three, four times, you have been to their 
same house three, four times?
    Mr. Ceravola. Oh, I have seen that multiple times.
    Mr. Bucshon. I mean, I am a big supporter of Narcan--do not 
get me wrong--but one of the challenges that we do have is that 
in some areas people can get complacent and feel like they will 
just show up and give me Narcan and save me, right? And I have 
had local law enforcement that have to use so much Narcan they 
run out, and then they cannot save people. Do you think that 
attitude prevails amongst the chronic users, that ``Oh well, 
they will just show up and give me Narcan''?
    Mr. Ceravola. I do know that there have been some 
situations where we saved someone and they actually woke up and 
fought with us--because here we are trying to save them, and 
actually we are trying to save ourselves--because they are mad 
that you ruined their high.
    Mr. Bucshon. That is a side effect of Narcan. The doctor 
can probably talk about that too. Narcan, people can have 
tachycardia, fast heart rates, and this type of reaction. So 
that is important to understand.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. The gentleman yields back, and I 
now recognize--Dr. Joyce, I just want to say to all your 
constituents that are sitting here what a beautiful area of our 
great country, not only historically important. I have Mammoth 
Cave National Park, Abraham Lincoln's birthplace. So if you are 
doing the national park checkoff, please come to Kentucky. But 
I will tell you this is stunningly beautiful. Everybody here 
has been wonderful to be around. Saratoga Battlefield. We just 
got that from my friend from Saratoga.
    But the National Park Service, thanks. I am proud of all 
the people that live in my district that work for the Park 
Service. They make America's great historic treasures--and even 
though the history is not always the grandest, greatest of 
history, it is history, and it is important what you guys do, 
so thanks a lot.
    And Dr. Joyce.
    Mr. Joyce. Well, thank you, Chairman. I think it is 
important that I echo that sentiment. I am a great-grandson of 
a Civil War veteran, and the battles continue. I think that we 
all recognize that one of the key battles that we have today is 
with opioid addiction, with the drug addiction that continues 
to permeate not just here in rural Pennsylvania but throughout 
America. I want to thank each and every one of you. I want to 
thank the National Park Service for providing us the 
opportunity.
    Today's hearing is about the SUPPORT Act, and we are going 
back to Washington with the great information that you have 
provided us with today to discuss how that should be 
reauthorized, how it might be altered, how it could be 
improved. So for my final question I would like each of you to 
address, this is your opportunity to tell Washington, how 
should we make the SUPPORT Act better? What Federal component 
should be improved?
    Ms. Keller, I would like to start with you.
    Ms. Keller. Thank you very much. I would suggest extending 
care to loved ones, because like we heard from Mr. Straley, 
when you lose a loved one you have a hole in your heart, and a 
lot of people do not know how to handle that moving forward. Or 
when you love someone with a substance use disorder, a lot of 
families do not know where to get help. So approaching this 
from a whole-family approach and wrapping our arms around not 
just the person with a substance use disorder but everyone 
around them that is affected by them, providing more resources 
for them to go to get help.
    And I would also urge you to invest in adolescent care. We 
are seeing a significant increase in young people with 
substance use disorder, and with the rise in fentanyl we are 
seeing a lot of younger people using fentanyl as well. So 
investing in adolescent resources so they have access to 
treatment, to mental health providers, and there is a severe 
lack of that right now.
    Mr. Joyce. I think that is a great message to take back. We 
certainly saw the isolation that occurred with the lockdowns 
during COVID, that individuals, particularly adolescents, 
turned to escape, and unfortunately, in some situations, that 
involved addictions that occurred.
    Mr. Straley, Federal legislation that could be better 
improved or altered as we address the reauthorization of the 
SUPPORT Act?
    Mr. Straley. I would say more funding for treatment centers 
and also sober-living homes, and certainly in our rural area in 
Franklin County, we have one sober-living facility for women 
and one facility for men, and they are constantly at full 
capacity. And we need more treatment centers and more sober-
living facilities to support those that are coming out and want 
to live a better life.
    Mr. Joyce. Dr. Crawford, as a physician I recognize the 
importance that this is recognized, that addiction is 
recognized as a disease. You made great comparisons talking 
about the possibility of weaning people from Suboxone over a 
long term. And you alluded to--and I might just ask you to 
expound just briefly, you alluded to that someone who suffers 
from hypertension, I might even postulate that there could be 
people in this room who are on medicines this morning treating 
their hypertension. And maybe with alterations to diet and to 
weight reduction and to exercise, you could possibly be weaned 
from medicines that would treat your hypertension. Similarly 
for diabetes, type 2 diabetes. If you are treated with 
medicines for type 2 diabetes, if you alter your lifestyle, if 
you have weight reduction, you might be able to do that. But in 
many cases that is not the case, as you and I recognize as 
physicians.
    Can you address two things? I am going to put you on the 
spot. Can you address two things? I do want to know how to 
alter, improve, and extend the SUPPORT Act and what 
recommendations you have at the Federal level. But I also want 
you to talk about the need for ongoing, long-term therapy as we 
recognize that addiction is a disease.
    Dr. Crawford. Absolutely. Yes, thank you very much. So I 
will try to be quite brief with the first part, and I 
appreciate the opportunity to share this. We touched on this 
briefly. You know, I believe, frankly, that we are in a 
behavioral health epidemic. So, you know, if I had a magic wand 
I would say let's do everything we can for behavioral health.
    But understanding we do not have that, when we think about 
the SUPPORT Act, I think it would be fantastic to continue to 
expand, in addition to opioid use disorder, all the other 
substance use disorders that we see. And we talked about the 
amount of folks who have died from poisonings, and that is not 
something we should take lightly, but we lose about three times 
as many people per year to alcohol. We lose about five times as 
many people to tobacco, still. So there is a tremendous 
opportunity for us to do more.
    And then to answer your question about the need for 
ongoing, long-term care: Absolutely. So there is a very kind of 
discussed-about and famous study within academic addiction 
circles comparing treatment outcomes and adherence to 
treatment, comparing addiction or substance use disorder to 
other chronic medical diseases, and there is no statistically 
significant difference between those.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you. Chief Ceravola, the message that this 
group, on the Health Subcommittee of Energy and Commerce, if 
there is an alteration or modification to the SUPPORT Act, from 
a law enforcement perspective, what should we take back to 
Washington?
    Mr. Ceravola. I think some of the things that we need to 
improve on is our drug takeback programs. Unfortunately, the 
last event I was not able to take part in, but I think getting 
some of the prescription drugs that are not being used anymore 
out of the medicine cabinets is a big help. I think mental 
health, with our mental health situations, making more beds 
available to people who need it to recover. And an early 
outreach and education, because I have a daughter that is going 
to turn 15 next month, and that is when I took my first drink. 
And I cannot imagine that she is going to be doing that. 
Honestly, she has a little bit of mental health issues as it 
is, and I am afraid she is going to go down that road. But I 
have to stop that.
    Mr. Joyce. Again, thank you Chairman and Ranking Member, 
and thank you for coming to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thanks for hosting us. We appreciate it.
    The gentleman yields back. Mr. Obernolte is recognized for 
5 minutes.
    Mr. Obernolte. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am 
delighted I get an opportunity to ask a second round of 
questions, because Dr. Crawford, I had one for you. I found 
your testimony very meaningful, and you said something that I 
found profound, enough so that I made a note of it. You said, 
``We have treatment, and treatment works.'' But I think it is 
important that we are very frank on this issue, because I might 
respectfully push back a little bit on that. I am not sure I 
agree. I would say we have treatment, and sometimes it works.
    One recurring theme in people that lose their lives to 
addiction is that they, quite often, have been in and out of 
treatment their entire lives. That has certainly been true in 
my own extended family, where I have people that I love that 
have been in and out of treatment programs and just cannot seem 
to get the problem solved. Mr. Straley gave some very 
incredibly emotional testimony about his daughter, who--the 
same thing: in and out of treatment programs until she lost her 
life.
    So it seems to me when someone comes into treatment and 
says, ``I have had enough. I need help. I want this to be over. 
I will do anything. Let's go,'' and we put them through 
treatment, and it does not work, you know, we have missed that 
opportunity. What can we do to reduce that cycle of in and out 
of treatment? What can we do to fix that problem that first 
time?
    Dr. Crawford. I wish I knew the full answer to that 
question. What I could share--and I appreciate your comment. 
You are absolutely right. So we have treatment, and treatment 
works, sometimes. It is probably a good caveat. When I make 
that comment I speak medically, and so we have no treatment 
that works 100 percent of the time, really, but it is 
statistically significantly an improvement over not treating, 
for example.
    But yes, so what can we do? I think one of the biggest 
things is taking an approach of harm reduction, as we have 
talked about, and also personalized care approaches. I think 
too often we are creating a program that has a structure that 
we say, ``OK, this is how you come into it and this is how it 
works for everyone.'' And we are all unique individuals with 
unique life journeys.
    And so I think having more flexibility, really, truly 
meeting people where they are at. You know, perhaps when they 
engage with us we should be asking them more what is the most 
important thing to them instead of assuming we know and trying 
to prescribe it to them. And so I think there is a lot of 
opportunity in approaches like that.
    Mr. Obernolte. Thank you. That is valuable.
    Ms. Keller, you said something in your testimony that 
really stuck with me also, when you were talking about 
telehealth and the need to expand access to telehealth. For my 
district, telehealth has been a complete game changer, 
particularly during the pandemic. And I actually wish we would 
stop calling it ``telehealth,'' because I know that is the 
technical term for it, but when I talk about it I call it 
``virtual health,'' because telehealth does not encapsulate how 
comprehensive our virtual treatment options are now. I mean, 
you are not just talking to a doctor on the telephone. Most of 
the time you are looking at them through a videoconference. 
Sometimes you are on remote sensing instruments that there they 
can use to make diagnoses. It is an amazing, game-changing 
technology.
    And I would say, following onto the discussion we have been 
having about trying to--when someone goes into treatment, 
trying to make it so that they get treated, that telehealth can 
be--see, I did it--virtual health could be really, really 
instrumental in this, particularly because we can use it to 
treat some of the behavioral health options and epidemics that 
exist in our country.
    So my question for you is, because you are an expert in 
this, how can we, in Congress, expand virtual health and 
virtual health treatment options for the people that we 
represent?
    Ms. Keller. Thank you for that. I agree that virtual health 
is going to be ----
    Mr. Obernolte. I like where you went there.
    Ms. Keller [continuing]. Yes, I mean, it is the way of the 
future, especially when it comes to treatment, because you can 
be in an opioid treatment program, in an inpatient center, and 
still be receiving mental health treatment or substance use 
treatment or just primary care treatment, especially in rural 
areas where you cannot access a program, you cannot drive to 
one or walk into one.
    So I think just making sure that insurance does cover it, 
that Medicaid covers it, and that every American has access to 
that. I think it is going to be a game-changer, especially you 
described you are in a very rural area. So I would venture to 
guess there are a lot fewer residents who just cannot drive to 
a treatment center.
    Mr. Obernolte. Right. Well, there were some flexibilities 
granted in Medicare treatment for virtual health options during 
the pandemic. I know that Congress has been working very hard 
to extend those flexibilities in areas where they were working, 
which is the vast majority of them. So we are certainly going 
to keep up that work. But thank you very much.
    Thank you very much to all of our witnesses. I really 
enjoyed the hearing today. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Guthrie. The gentleman yields back, and that concludes 
two rounds of Members' questions. It has been an informative 
hearing and important work that we have before us to do. So 
thank you so much for taking your time and hearing your 
stories. We all have family members that have similar 
situations.
    Now I will ask unanimous consent, we are going to insert 
into the record, there is a list of documents that have been 
provided to the staff, both Democrat and Republican staffs have 
agreed to. I know Mr. Tonko had a list that he submitted for 
the record. Of course, my written opening statement. So without 
objection, so ordered. Those are submitted for the record.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr. Guthrie. And also you may receive written questions 
from Members. So I will remind Members they have 10 days to 
submit questions for the record and ask the witnesses if you 
could respond promptly to those questions. I really appreciate 
that. Members should submit their questions by the close of 
business on June 23rd.
    So thank you so much. Thanks to our law enforcement 
officers here today. Thank you for your service. And without 
objection, the subcommittee is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:10 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
