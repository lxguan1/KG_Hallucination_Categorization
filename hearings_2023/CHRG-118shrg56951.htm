                              ----------                              


                        THURSDAY, APRIL 27, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
          Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met at 10 a.m., in room 538, Dirksen Senate 
Office Building, Hon. Sherrod Brown, Chair of the Committee, 
presiding.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIR SHERROD BROWN

    Chair Brown. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs will come to order. Thank you to the witnesses 
today for joining us.
    The three witnesses today, plain and simple, determine the 
financial futures of every American. Equifax, Experian, and 
TransUnion are this country's biggest credit reporting 
agencies. You have, as you know and as we have talked, 
tremendous power over people's lives.
    The information you collect and put in people's credit 
reports determine whether people can get a mortgage or buy a 
car; what interest rate they pay; what credit cards they can 
get, at what rate; whether they will get insurance and what 
they pay for it; whether they will be able to rent an 
apartment; whether they will be accepted for a job. All of 
that, in some sense, is in your hands.
    These companies are not just keepers of consumer data. They 
essentially manage--or mismanage, as the case may be--
Americans' financial reputations. When your reports matter this 
much, with consequences this drastic, it is important that you 
get it right. It is vital that these reports contain only 
information that is useful and fair and, above all, accurate.
    In 2017, when Equifax experienced a massive data breach, 
the American public was, frankly, shocked to find out exactly 
how much credit reporting agencies are involved in their lives. 
No offense, but they do not think about you a whole lot. The 
company compromised the personal information of more than 147 
million consumers--including their Social Security numbers. 
Millions of people were forced into a crash course on how 
frustrating it can be to deal with credit reporting companies 
when they make a mistake. They had to place a credit freeze, 
they had to request their credit report, they were told to 
constantly monitor their information for inaccuracies.
    People are busy enough with their children and their jobs 
and their lives. They should not have to spend that kind of 
time, because some company they have never heard of screwed up.
    The data breach affected millions of people at once and got 
a lot of attention. But that was far from the only case of 
costly mistakes by your companies.
    Today, credit reports are stilled riddled with errors. 
According to a FTC study, 1 in 5 consumers had errors in at 
least one of their three credit reports, and 1 in 20 had errors 
that affected the likelihood of receiving credit or affected 
their credit rate.
    More than 200 million Americans are in the Experian, 
Equifax, and TransUnion credit reporting system. That means 
that potentially 40 million consumers have errors on their 
credit reports.
    In a 2022 report, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
also found that Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion routinely 
failed to adequately respond to consumers with errors in their 
reports. After this report, the three credit reporting agencies 
instituted some reforms to better respond to consumer 
complaints about errors on their credit reports.
    It is an important, though long overdue, first step.
    But errors like mixed files, where the information of a 
different consumer appears on a credit file, are still far too 
common. Mixed files are such a pervasive problem that, in 2015, 
30 Attorneys General settled a lawsuit with the three credit 
reporting agencies--understanding you were not CEOs then--over 
this problem. Among other reforms, the credit reporting 
agencies were required to establish minimum standards for 
matching criteria and reducing mixed files.
    And it is more than just mixed-up files. Some people, still 
very much alive, are declared dead. They have their idstolen. 
The list goes on.
    Errors are also introduced into this system by what are 
called ``furnishers,'' companies supplying information to the 
credit reporting agencies.
    Debt collectors are some of the worst offenders when it 
comes to supplying wrong information. The CFPB found that even 
though debt collectors supply just 13 percent of the accounts 
to credit reports, they are responsible for 40 percent of the 
disputes on credit reports--13 percent, 40 percent.
    Americans can be dinged on their reports for debts in some 
cases they do not even owe.
    It is not just errors that do not belong on credit reports. 
Medical debt, in particular--and I have spoken to each of you 
about that--has absolutely no place on credit reports.
    In 2022, just in this country, an estimated 43 million 
Americans held $88 billion of medical debt on their credit 
reports.
    Low-income families, Black and Hispanic households, 
veterans, and older Americans are hit particularly hard. But 
medical debt can happen to anyone. It does not matter if you do 
everything right. Anyone can get sick. Anyone can get in a car 
accident. It has nothing to do with your ability to pay your 
bills--or at least it should not.
    Medical debt does not correlate with credit risk. It 
correlates with illness or injury. No one should have their 
financial future destroyed because of a medical emergency, or a 
sick family member.
    That's why I am asking your companies to stop putting 
medical debt, period, on your reports. And after increasing 
scrutiny and pressure a year ago, you all announced they would 
significantly change how medical collection debt is reported.
    One of the major reforms announced is the removal of all 
medical debts of $500 or below from credit reports. This is a 
good step--thank you--but it is also not enough.
    If you have $1,000 in medical debt, you are no less 
creditworthy than someone with $500. It stems from the same 
problem--someone in your family or you got sick or injured.
    The CFPB found that the remaining medical debt on credit 
reports will disproportionately belong to consumers living in 
majority minority and lower-income neighborhoods.
    Your companies also provide tenant screening services--
another way you have tremendous power over people's lives, and 
another way your errors can have disastrous consequences. When 
tenant screening turns up erroneous eviction filings, people 
cannot find a place to live. And because tenant screening 
reports are not as available as regular credit reports, renters 
may cycle through rejection after rejection, without ever 
knowing there is an error on the credit report.
    After pressing the CFPB to address these errors, I was glad 
to see they and the FTC announce a Request for Information on 
how background screenings, like tenant screening reports, 
affects renters' ability to obtain housing.
    Just yesterday, this Committee held a hearing about the 
challenges Americans face affording housing. In a highly 
competitive housing market. Inaccurate data mean renters lose 
out on a home, making things, of course, worse.
    It is hard enough for Americans to get a foothold in the 
middle class. The last thing workers should have to contend 
with are careless mistakes from companies that have too much 
power over some of the most important aspects of their lives.
    It is vital that the reports that your companies issue be 
accurate, not include medical debts, period, and that errors be 
fewer and correctable.
    I do not think it is a lot to ask.
    Senator Scott.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TIM SCOTT

    Senator Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to 
the witnesses for being here with us this morning. Such a 
really important topic, one that we have worked on for the last 
5 years of my time in the Senate, making sure that we have 
access to the best credit we can get based on someone being 
creditworthy. I think that is a really important part.
    I say that because I look back at my own family's history 
back to the 1920s and 1930s when my grandfather was growing up 
in the Jim Crow South, where getting a loan had more to do with 
your relationships, not to do with your creditworthiness. And 
so when we move toward a model that allows people to access 
credit based on their relationships, it can sometimes lead to 
discrimination. But when we have an objective standard that is 
applied to everyone fairly and consistently, the Nation is a 
better place. Accessing credit, accessing the American Dream 
through home ownership is more realistic based on your 
creditworthiness.
    My story continues in a very similar direction as my 
grandfather's did. In the 1990s, when I was starting my small 
business, I would say without any question I went to a bank and 
had a conversation with a banker about assets versus 
liabilities, and at that point, my best asset was a 1990 240SX 
that had 253,000 miles on it. Not necessarily the definition of 
an asset, but I tried to use it to borrow some money against 
it, and the bank rightly laughed me out of the bank.
    But I did develop a relationship where we had an 
opportunity to look at my very light credit score. I did not 
have much credit at all. And so that works against you when you 
are trying to start a new small business. And if you need a 
revolving line of credit, banks are less likely to loan against 
no assets, the ability to come back and forth to the same 
institution. So that is a challenge. But the more I worked with 
a banker to appreciate building that credit score, 
understanding the principles that are so important to American 
prosperity, I was able to achieve my goal of opening my first 
Allstate insurance agency with the help of a friend who put 
some money into the business as well as a bank that finally 
concluded that I was an appropriate risk.
    That situation today manifests in different ways, in that 
the credit score now impacts your rates and your insurance 
business. And having been in the business of insurance, your 
auto insurance, your home insurance, not just your loans, are 
literally decided by your creditworthiness. And because of 
that, I think we have to do everything in our power to make 
sure that as we head toward and continue to make progress on 
our risk-based method, it takes the subjective nature out of 
lending that relied only on relationships, reputation, or word 
of mouth, and in turn created, in my opinion, a fairer, 
objective measure of creditworthiness, increasing access to 
credit, and frankly, making it more inclusive as well.
    This is so important because with hard work and responsible 
financial decisions, anyone can develop and improve their 
credit score and obtain access to credit in a manner that 
represents their financial opportunity. Increasing taxpayer-
backed risk in the housing market as this Administration's 
economic policies push us toward a recession is anything other 
than ``equitable.''
    At the same time, the CFPB has the audacity to announce it 
is exploring new avenues of regulatory overreach on whole 
numbers of different issues, ranging from data privacy to late 
payment fees, despite the fact that the agency itself 
experienced a data breach exposing the information of more than 
250,000 Americans and then hiding that breach for several 
weeks. It is so amazing how tirelessly this Administration 
works to put dollars on the sidelines instead of in taxpayers' 
pockets. I look forward to getting answers and holding Director 
Chopra responsible.
    At the end of the day, the data that lenders use becomes 
less secure, less reliable and predictive. It will simply 
result in higher rates and fewer loans made to people at the 
margins of the credit box, people just like me. Yet another 
example of the Biden administration's policies hurting the 
people who can afford it the least.
    However, there is good news. American innovation and free 
market competition are creating new avenues toward prosperity. 
As technology develops and lenders are able to use new or 
alternative sources of data to better predict the risk of 
default, ``credit invisible'' Americans will increasingly be 
able to participate in our financial markets, and that is 
really good news. Common sense and technological innovation has 
the potential to bring an estimated 50 million Americans with 
thin or no credit files into the financial system, and is a 
goal I have been working on, as I said at the beginning, for 
years.
    My Credit Access and Inclusion Act, the Building Credit 
Access for Veterans Act, and finally, the Credit Score 
Competition Act, which was signed into law in 2018, are all 
designed to allow for the use of new, reliable, predictive data 
in our system. As we push forward with these improvements in 
technology and new sources of data, which are already showing 
promise at making our markets fairer and more accessible, we 
should also consider what guardrails may be needed to ensure 
responsible growth and consumer protection.
    I look forward to hearing from the witnesses today on this 
really important topic and look forward to asking you some 
questions, as well.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Scott.
    The three witnesses joining us today, Mark Begor has served 
as CEO and board member of Equifax since April 2018. From March 
2016 to April 2018, he served as a member of the board of 
directors at FICO.
    Chris Cartwright has served as President and CEO of 
TransUnion since May 2019. He joined TransUnion in August 2014. 
Welcome.
    Mr. Brian Cassin has served as CEO of Experian since July 
2014. He was previously appointed to the board as CFO in April 
2012.
    Thank you all for joining us, and Mr. Begor, please begin.

         STATEMENT OF MARK W. BEGOR, CEO, EQUIFAX INC.

    Mr. Begor. Good morning. Chairman Brown, Ranking Member 
Scott, and distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you 
for the opportunity to be here today.
    I am Mark Begor, the Chief Executive Officer of Equifax. 
Since 2018, I have led the transformation of our company to 
build a new Equifax and a culture that values and supports 
consumers, customers, and communities. I recognize the 
important role that Equifax plays in the financial lives of 
consumers, and I take this responsibility very seriously.
    Our company's purpose is to help people live their 
financial best, and Equifax is committed to putting consumers 
first and helping people access useful and affordable financial 
products and services in a responsible and sustainable way.
    We know that every financial first, whether it is a college 
loan, a credit card, or a mortgage to purchase a first home, 
can spur positive economic change, and we constantly look for 
ways to bring greater financial opportunity to more people in 
more places.
    Over the past 5 years, we have invested in incremental, 
more than $1.5 billion to rebuild our IT infrastructure to the 
most advanced cloud technology capabilities available. This is 
one of the largest cloud investments ever undertaken in our 
industry, and it is changing every facet of our infrastructure 
and our operations. Our new cloud capabilities are allowing us 
to enhance the accuracy of data and to more effectively 
leverage our alternative data to expand access to credit while 
also delivering industry-leading security.
    We know that one of the keys to responsibly expanding 
consumer access to credit and supporting a more inclusive 
economy is leveraging information that is not traditionally 
included in the credit report, and we are focused on offering 
innovative solutions that can bring increased visibility to 
underserved consumers.
    For example, we recently became the first in our industry 
to provide a new mortgage credit report that combines utility 
and cellphone data with traditional credit data. The majority 
of American adults have at least one utility or cellphone bill 
in their name, and using this additional data in a mortgage 
underwriting could raise the credit scores of as many 2.4 
million consumers by an average of 30 points, moving them into 
a higher score band and potentially enabling them to either get 
approved or to receive more favorable mortgage interest rates.
    In addition to our efforts to expand access to credit, 
Equifax is taking strong steps to be more consumer friendly at 
every touch. We have invested over $75 million to improve the 
overall experience that consumers have with Equifax. We are 
ensuring that our written communications are in plain language. 
We have added tools like video clips to our website to help 
consumers navigate the dispute process. And we have made it 
easier for consumers to both manage their disputes online and 
track their disputes throughout the process.
    We are committed to correcting errors on consumer reports 
quickly and transparently, and we are working with our industry 
colleagues to limit errors from occurring in the first place.
    Another element of our focus on consumers is ensuring that 
we maintain the most accurate data possible. Even one single 
error on a consumer's credit report is one error too many. It 
is a personal priority for me that consumers trust their credit 
reports to contain accurate and complete data.
    To strengthen our accuracy program at Equifax, we are 
driving initiatives in three key areas. We are streamlining our 
dispute processes and rewriting our consumer communications to 
use more plain language. We are implementing automation to more 
quickly identify errors in data before it goes on the credit 
file. And we are working more closely with our furnishers to 
communicate issues that we find, and correct them going 
forward.
    While I am proud of our progress, there is more we can and 
will do. We are deeply committed to putting consumers first, 
and that means ensuring that we are providing lenders with 
accurate information so that consumers can get the credit that 
they need. And we continue to focus on our leadership in data 
security, and to
foster a culture where data security is central to our team's 
DNA. We have built one of the world's most advanced and 
effective cybersecurity programs, and our security capabilities 
exceed all industry benchmarks. We believe that transparency, 
communication, and collaboration delivers stronger security, 
and we continue to actively engage with our customers, 
policymakers, and other organizations regarding the challenges 
and opportunities in cybersecurity on a daily basis.
    While we still have more work to do, I am proud of our 
progress that we have made over the last 5 years. Our resolve 
to achieve our company purpose to help people live their 
financial best and put consumers first has never been stronger.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to share some of the 
key priorities of the new Equifax and for your dedication to 
your constituents and American consumers.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Mr. Begor. I appreciate you being 
here.
    Mr. Cartwright, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF CHRIS A. CARTWRIGHT, PRESIDENT AND CEO, TRANSUNION

    Mr. Cartwright. Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, 
distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for this 
invitation to appear. My name is Chris Cartwright and I am 
President and CEO of TransUnion (TU).
    TransUnion is a global company headquartered in Chicago and 
one-of-three major credit reporting agencies in the United 
States. We have nearly 5,000 employees in the United States, 
and over 12,000 worldwide.
    TransUnion's mission is to help people and society through 
information, to ensure fairness for consumers and to assist 
businesses in identifying underserved communities and managing 
business risks.
    The credit reporting agencies are the backbone of the 
modern consumer credit economy. We play a key role in the 
efficient and stable functioning of the Nation's financial 
system. We serve as clearinghouses and record keepers, and we 
help consumers gain access to credit quickly and efficiently. 
We do not make lending decisions. We provide information that 
helps consumers obtain credit and helps lenders in underwriting 
and establishing credit terms. Our credit reports help more 
than 254 million consumers per year obtain important financial 
products, allowing them to achieve their personal goals through 
affordable credit.
    Today's consumers expect near instant access to credit. We 
help make this possible by providing an efficient and reliable 
way for lenders to assess consumers' willingness and ability to 
repay their loans. Ultimately, the system enhances quality of 
life and strengthens the American economy.
    We also play an important role for the lending community 
and for preserving financial stability. We help banks and 
financial institutions of all sizes more accurately manage 
risk, and we have seen, in the past several months, ensuring 
lending institutions have the data to understand and mitigate 
risk is critical to the overall health and resilience of the 
U.S. banking sector.
    At the core of TransUnion's business is a commitment to 
data accuracy. Data accuracy is the fundamental underpinning of 
the entire credit reporting system. We must get it right. A 
strong and accurate reporting system benefits consumers, 
businesses, and the economy.
    TransUnion has led the industry in building a system that 
helps consumers quickly address any errors in their credit 
reports and work directly with furnishers to expeditiously 
resolve any inaccurately reported items. Through our efforts, 
our turnaround time in addressing consumer disputes is now 
approximately 9 days--well below what is required by law.
    We understand the great responsibility we have in 
stewarding data that touches the lives of nearly every 
American. Financial inclusion is a key pillar of our company's 
strategy. We are proud to be industry leaders in promoting 
expanded credit access through alternative data. Alternative 
data sources, such as rental and utility data, provides 
opportunities for people to build credit profiles quickly and 
accurately. We believe alternative data is really a story of 
economic fairness. If this information were reported at scale, 
it would substantially increase credit access for millions of 
Americans.
    We also know the real impact credit reports have on 
consumers' lives. We are committed to getting it right every 
time. Since I became CEO of the company, TransUnion has 
undergone a transformation focused on improving the consumer 
experience. Among other things, during this transformation we 
have partnered with our peers at the outset of the pandemic to 
provide consumers with free weekly credit reports.
    We are continually investing in our operations to build a 
best-in-class dispute-resolution infrastructure, to make sure 
our data is as accurate as possible and consumers' experiences 
are seamless. We recently removed all paid medical debt from 
credit files, and we made changes that will remove more than 70 
percent of all unpaid medical collections from credit reports.
    Senators, we recognize that partnering with policymakers is 
essential. We appreciate the work of this Committee, in 
particular, Chairman Brown and Ranking Member Scott, for your 
leadership in helping to make the credit reporting system 
stronger. We want to continue to build on our successful 
history, and we will continue to work with Congress and our 
regulators to provide consumers with the tools they need to 
realize economic opportunities.
    Thank you, Senators, and I look forward to answering your 
questions.
    Chair Brown. Thank you very much, Mr. Cartwright.
    Mr. Cassin, welcome.

          STATEMENT OF BRIAN J. CASSIN, CEO, EXPERIAN

    Mr. Cassin. Chairman Brown, Ranking Committee Member Scott, 
and Members of the Committee, I am Brian Cassin, CEO of 
Experian. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the important 
work Experian does for the benefit of consumers, lenders, and 
the U.S. economy.
    Let me begin by stating why credit bureaus exist, how 
consumers benefit, and how our work provides underlying 
stability to the entire consumer credit ecosystem.
    Credit bureaus accurately compile consumers' payment 
histories reported to us by individual creditors so that all 
lenders can use this data to make sound underwriting decisions. 
Good lending decisions mean fewer defaults. Fewer defaults 
reduce the cost of credit and increase the availability of 
consumer credit across the economy. Because credit bureau data 
does not include demographic factors such as race, color, 
religion, and gender, it also helps lenders make nonbiased 
lending decisions in compliance with the Equal Credit 
Opportunity Act.
    Experian wholly understands its obligations, to ensure the 
information we hold on consumers is secure, to make credit 
reports accurate, and provide a method to correct data that is 
easy for consumers to access and use.
    Experian supports this Committee's goal of enhancing the 
accuracy of credit reports, improving consumers' experience 
through the dispute-resolution process, and making fair and 
affordable credit available to all communities.
    Experian has invested heavily in systems and processes to 
improve data accuracy, and we continually strive to reach 100 
percent accuracy. We work with approximately 10,000 lenders and 
other data contributors across the spectrum of consumer 
lending, including credit card, auto, mortgage, retail, and 
fintech, and we and have stringent requirements and monitoring 
programs in place to ensure that our furnishers are submitting 
accurate information to us.
    An important component of accuracy is a consumer's right to 
review their own credit report and correct errors. With 
millions of free reports and scores in the ecosystem monthly, 
consumers have easy and free access to their report 
information, including through annualcreditreport.com, which 
provides free weekly reports to consumers. Experian has a free 
online dispute portal, including a mobile-optimized website and 
app. Consumers can also easily reach us by telephone or mail.
    Mr. Chairman, studies suggest that as many as 50 million 
American adults are unable to access fair and affordable 
credit, either because they have a very thin credit file or 
because they are completely credit invisible. We also 
understand that many consumers, particularly minorities and 
lower-income individuals, are often under-represented in the 
credit reporting system.
    This is an area where Experian has been at the forefront 
with the launch of Experian Boost in early 2019. Boost allows 
consumers, for the first time, to safely and easily opt-in to 
having proven payment information, like utility, cellphone, 
rent, and video streaming services, included directly in their 
credit report, which can improve their credit score.
    In January 2022, we also launched Experian Go, a ground-
breaking feature that helps consumers who are credit invisible 
to establish a financial identity with Experian so they can 
begin building a credit history.
    Since its launch, more than 12 million consumers have come 
to Experian Boost to improve their credit score, and 130,000
consumers have used Experian Go to establish a financial 
identity. The results are notable. We estimate that consumers 
have been able to access billions of dollars in credit post-
Boost, including credit cards, car loans, and mortgages. 
Experian is also providing access to free credit monitoring, 
free credit reports, free credit scores, and financial 
education to more than 65 million U.S. consumers.
    Mr. Chairman, I am very proud of the work our employees do 
every day to help and empower consumers. We would like to 
continue to work with this Committee to identify other ways we 
can improve the system for consumers.
    Thank you for inviting me to testify, and I look forward to 
answering your questions.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Mr. Cassin.
    We will begin the questions with Senator Smith, of 
Minnesota.
    Senator Smith. Great. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Ranking 
Member, and thanks to all of you for being with us today. I 
really appreciate it.
    Black, Hispanic, and Native American consumers tend to have 
lower credit scores than their White and Asian counterparts, 
and this is not necessarily because they are less creditworthy. 
It is because they are more likely to be among the 45 million 
Americans that fall outside of the mainstream credit system, 
those that are considered--I think I heard one of you use this 
term--credit invisible or unscorable because they do not have 
enough traditional credit information in their files to 
generate a conventional credit score.
    So Mr. Cartwright, maybe I will direct this question to 
you. How can we use alternative data, such as rental history or 
utilities or cellphone or internet payments, to help address 
this inequity within the credit scoring system?
    Mr. Cartwright. Well Senator, first thank you for the 
question. It is a hugely important issue and an opportunity for 
our industry to improve the manner in which we serve consumers 
and the American financial system. I agree with the points that 
you have made. In my mind, this falls under the umbrella of 
alternative information that can be used to reliably establish 
a consumer's ability and willingness to repay debt.
    There are tens of millions of consumers in the United 
States who have thin credit files or are credit invisible. We 
know that information, such as rental payments, utility bills, 
telecommunication data, et cetera, provide a strong signal and 
prediction of a consumer's financial management behavior, and 
we would like to gain access to this information, at scale, and 
create a pathway for these traditionally underserved groups to 
access the mainstream financial system.
    Senator Smith. So the barrier is getting access to the 
data?
    Mr. Cartwright. Yes, Senator, that is correct. Each of the 
bureaus has a degree of access to this information today. 
However, there is no requirement that the current custodians of 
this information furnish it to the credit reporting industry. 
If there were regulation or legislation that required that we 
would be able to get comprehensive access to this information 
and accurately add that to the consumer's credit file, and 
improve financial inclusion dramatically.
    Again, we have a history of such innovations in our 
industry, and we have seen that each time we expand the 
inclusion of accurate and truthful information, tens of 
millions of consumers can now engage in credit.
    Senator Smith. So medical debt that has gone to collections 
affects 1 in 5 Americans, a group that, again, is 
disproportionately comprised of elderly folks, veterans, low-
income people, Black and Hispanic patients. So I am grateful 
for the step that you have taken over the past year to minimize 
the impact of medical debt on these groups of folks. However, 
as you acknowledged when you announced your most recent 
changes, medical debt is generally not taken on voluntarily, 
right?
    So based on that, patients do not always have the ability 
to choose providers or to shop around for their care, and the 
true cost of care might not be readily available or they might 
not know what that is up front.
    So Mr. Begor, maybe I will direct this question to you. 
Taking all of that into consideration, what value does medical 
debt really have in determining creditworthiness, and do you 
think that it should be included at all?
    Mr. Begor. Senator, we agree with you that the medical debt 
situation is very complex. Our hospital systems, the billing 
systems that they have, the insurance systems are some of the 
most complex out there. You know that the industry, the three 
credit bureaus, made a proactive move to, number one, exclude 
all debt for a year, medical debt, to give consumers a chance 
to sort that out, and then second, to exclude medical debt 
below $500, which eliminated about 70 percent of the trade 
line. So we thought that was a proactive step going forward.
    And then we are doing more around ensuring that the medical 
debt that is contributed is accurate inside of the credit file.
    Senator Smith. OK. As I understand it, when you announced 
that that medical debt under $500 would be exempt from credit 
reports that you noted that this applies to the initial report 
balance. But depending on the care that folks receive and the 
providers that take care of them, you could end up with 
multiple bills that exceed $500. How would you address that?
    Mr. Begor. The same thing, Senator. I think it is something 
we can look further into. We agree with you that the complexity 
of medical debt is something that needs to be addressed, and we 
thought that a move on $500 was proactive. I think there is 
more we can do to look at the issue.
    Senator Smith. I would encourage you to do that. Thank you. 
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Smith.
    Senator Scott is recognized.
    Senator Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Senator Smith, 
I have something called the Credit Access and Inclusion Act 
that allows for more information to be added to the system 
voluntarily, and Mr. Cassin talked about, and Mr. Cartwright 
has talked about, so I would love to have a conversation with 
you about the legislation.
    I do think there are two ways for us to actually see more 
access to credit, and one way, I think, is flawed and likely 
will lead ultimately, long term, to less access because you 
create a less reliable scoring system. And I think we are 
seeing that in part from the FHFA Director Thompson, who is 
departing from risk-based pricing on individual loans purchased 
by the GSEs, creating a perverse incentive structure that will 
penalize borrowers who have worked really hard to improve their 
credit or save for their down payment.
    So when you look at ways to water down the credit score in 
order to create more access, I think ultimately you destroy the 
very system that I talked about, that I think needs to be 
objective that needs to be based on the credit risk itself. And 
there are ways for us to make sure that specifically minority 
borrowers who are more often than not going to be renting a 
home, not owning the home, based on the fact that 41 percent of 
African Americans today own their homes, which means ultimately 
59 percent do not, so if you are not including the rent 
payment, if you are not including beyond credit card payments, 
the utility payments, the phone bill, the mobile phone bills, 
there are other ways for us to make sure. And if we are doing 
those things and adding them in, we are creating a more fair 
yet objective system.
    Mr. Cassin, I know that you talked a little bit about Boost 
in your opening comments. My question to you is, how is it 
going, number one, and number two, do you find that the 
accuracy of the information that is being input is consistent 
with the same level of accuracy that allows you to still have a 
fairly objective system?
    Mr. Cassin. Well, thank you, Senator. Yes, since we 
launched Boost, which was in 2019, we have had over 12 million 
consumers connect and those that complete the process add 
additional trade lines to their credit reports, and we do this 
through a fairly simple process. We gain access to their 
checking accounts--it is consumer permission, so the consumer 
opts in to do this. We look for these trade lines and we add 
them to the credit report, and then we immediately rescore 
them.
    Those who have completed the process have seen an average 
increase of 13 points to their FICO score, so it has been 
hugely beneficial.
    We have worked with the industry to ensure that it works 
and that the information is valid to be included, so the 
scoring systems work. We have worked with all the scoring 
companies.
    So we believe this is a very effective way of actually 
helping people who have thin credit files, and ultimately also 
for people who have no credit history. So a very proactive 
step.
    We did take a further step, Senator, more recently with the 
launch of a product called Experian Go, which is actually 
targeted at people who have no credit history, so they can 
establish an account with Experian for the first time. And 
these kinds of initiatives, we think, are incredibly helpful at 
addressing that large population of people who have limited or 
no access to credit, Senator.
    Senator Scott. Does anyone else want to comment on that 
topic?
    Mr. Begor. Senator, I agree with Brian as well as your 
points around more data results in better decisions. We have 
some large databases of nontraditional credit data. For 
example, we have a database of 220 million Americans' cellphone 
payment records and utility records, and we have recently taken 
that data and added it to our mortgage credit file. That drives 
the predictability of the consumers, particularly those at the 
lower end of the credit space that have less trade lines. So if 
you are adding in someone's cellphone bill that they pay every 
month, it is a predictor that they are going to pay their 
financial bills on time.
    And from that new product we think as many 2.4 million 
consumers will see a 30-point lift in their credit score by 
adding those nontraditional data elements in.
    We are going after rental data payment, as you suggested. 
Very complex to collect, as was already pointed out, but we 
have a big priority around adding nontraditional data sources 
to expand access to credit.
    Senator Scott. I know I am running out of time so I will 
just say this. The use of objective standards is so critically 
important, and I see this move across the country that somehow 
we are going to make the lives, specifically of minorities, 
better by eliminating objective standards in everything--in 
education, in credit scores--and that, to me, is insulting as 
an African American, that the only way for me to be competitive 
is for you to somehow eliminate the thresholds. That is 
ridiculous. I cannot think of anything more ridiculous than 
that.
    I would say this on this topic--there are lots of things 
more ridiculous--but not on this topic. I also hope that you 
all are spending a lot of time investing in financial literacy 
as a path forward to helping people understand and appreciate 
the necessity. What you look like on paper might become the 
most important single factor in how you live your life in the 
future, as it relates to being creditworthy. Thank you.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Scott.
    I will take my 5 minutes now.
    Thank you for your response to Senator Smith. It was a 
start, but inadequate, but I want to talk to you more about 
medical debt. I appreciate your commitment to increasing access 
to credit overall. I appreciate the $500 threshold that you are 
doing, that you are not putting in the reports up to $500. I 
appreciate the first year of not reporting, and I appreciate 
that if the medical debt is paid it is not on the credit 
report. But I want to talk a little more about that.
    CFPB just released a report that found for consumers with 
under $500 in medical debt, removing medical debt increased 
their credit scores by 32 points, that when medical collection 
is removed from credit reports the total amount of available 
revolving credit increased by over $1,000.
    My question, starting with you, Mr. Begor, will you commit 
to removing medical debt above $500 from credit reports?
    Mr. Begor. Senator, I think we made a very proactive move 
with the $500 decision, that year, and we are focused on 
accuracy of medical debt, and it is certainly something we will 
look at in the future and collaborate with your office.
    Chair Brown. You are not willing to commit right now?
    Mr. Begor. We would like to collaborate with your office on 
it, Senator, and look at it closely.
    Chair Brown. Mr. Cartwright, same question.
    Mr. Cartwright. Thank you for the question, sir, and thanks 
for acknowledging the progress that the industry has made in 
this difficult and sometimes controversial issue.
    Senator, I would agree that we should continue to analyze 
this issue and determine what is the best threshold for 
including medical debt within the credit record. I think we 
have to acknowledge that at some level medical debt could 
become a burden for a consumer to incur even more debt. I think 
the best outcomes is when all the players in the credit 
reporting system, be it the bureaus, the banks, consumers, and 
certainly this Committee, collaborate and analyze the 
information and let the data lead us to the best outcome.
    Chair Brown. So back to the question. To Mr. Begor, you are 
not willing today, at this hearing, to commit to taking all 
medical debt off over $500? You are not willing to commit to 
that today.
    Mr. Cartwright. Senator, what I am willing to commit to is 
to apply considerable resources, working with this Committee, 
to analyze the data and help determine what is the appropriate 
balance to strike for the financial system.
    Chair Brown. Mr. Cassin, the same question to you.
    Mr. Cassin. Thank you, Senator. It is the same response, 
Senator. I think we have taken very proactive steps. We agree 
this is a really important issue. It is also a complex issue. 
And I think we will commit to working very proactively with 
your staff to see if we can make any further steps. It does 
involve a lot of stakeholders. I think it goes beyond just any 
decision that the three credit bureaus could make themselves.
    Chair Brown. OK. The decision is that working with our 
staff is the best way to do that, I will reiterate, is a better 
answer to that question. But, I mean, you all know that--I 
mean, you have essentially said that. It is not predictive. It 
has no place. And you have sort of ceded that it has no place 
in credit reports.
    The three of you own VantageScore, as you know. In 2022, 
VantageScore announced it will no longer include medical debt 
as part of its credit scoring model because medical debts, 
quote, ``are not predictive of a consumer's creditworthiness.'' 
That is why I am urging today, and will continue to urge, as 
Senator Smith urged, that you take all medical debt off of 
credit reports.
    Let me do one other question, then I will turn it to 
Senator Britt and then Senator Warren.
    Tenant screening reports go beyond just credit information. 
Mr. Cartwright, this question is specifically for you. They 
include eviction filings, criminal histories, and just like 
credit reports, these tenant screening reports can have errors. 
The catch is renters cannot see these reports, as you know, so 
to get an apartment you are forced to allow landlords to look 
at reports on you that you cannot even see yourself.
    TransUnion is the largest of the three of you. You play the 
most central role in this. TransUnion is a large provider of 
tenant screening reports. Should a tenant have the ability to 
see a copy of their tenant screening report, actually see not 
just provide consent, when a landlord is using it to decide 
about renting to them?
    Mr. Cartwright. Senator, TU is committed to making sure 
that tenant screening data is accurate. The information that we 
receive from the several sources that you referenced is 
generally authoritative and it is very accurate. We have also 
invested considerable sums in the algorithms and analytics that 
match this information to the current consumer.
    When errors are identified in the system we are proactive, 
we report this information to the furnishers of that 
information, and we allow the record to be corrected.
    Senator, this screening information, it plays an important 
role in enabling tenants to get housing opportunities. The data 
is also an important tool to help property owners expand that 
opportunity, but also to protect their tenant communities.
    So we are committed to full and fair access to the 
information as provided under Federal law, but we also take our 
obligation to make sure the data is as accurate as possible 
very seriously.
    Chair Brown. So you are not saying every tenant should have 
the ability to see a copy of this screening report?
    Mr. Cartwright. Chairman Brown, consumers are able to see 
the information that is reported against them, and they are 
able to dispute it under the FCRA. And again, when errors are 
identified we report it back to the sources of that 
information.
    So I agree with you that transparency in this process, just 
as in financial trade lines, is hugely important.
    Chair Brown. So are you saying that--I mean, you are good, 
your answer. So are you saying that tenants now will see the 
reports? They will be able to know if they are accurate? They 
will be able to get them cleaned up when they are applying to 
rent somewhere, ahead of time?
    I mean, you know what has happened here, Mr. Cartwright, 
that tenants get turned down. They do not really know why. They 
get turned down at a second place. The potential landlord has 
seen the reports. The tenant has not. How do we fix that then, 
if you are not going to more directly, aggressively, 
proactively get these reports in the tenants' hands, so, one, 
they understand, and two, they may see errors that they can 
clean up and then get an apartment that they were not able to 
get?
    Mr. Cartwright. Well Senator, it is certainly important 
that the data is accurate. We spend a huge amount of resources 
to make sure that it is. It is also important that it is 
transparent under the FCRA. If a consumer is turned down for 
credit or a tenant is denied a housing opportunity, they need 
to know the reason, and once they are given that reason they 
have an opportunity to access the----
    Chair Brown. But do they know the reason now?
    Mr. Cartwright. ----information and correct it.
    Chair Brown. Do they know the reason, when the potential 
landlord gets the credit report, sees something that is 
disturbing to them, they do not rent to this potential renter? 
Is that something you are going to fix so these tenants, these 
prospective tenants can see that information? I understand you 
are working to make them accurate. I believe all three of you, 
in our meetings and now, that you are trying to do that, a very 
complex world. But these tenants, I mean, person by person, is 
this going to be remedied?
    Mr. Cartwright. Senator, it is difficult for me to speak 
for all of the practices that are out there in the market. I do 
believe that landlords are responsible for communicating the 
reasons for denying access to housing to applicants, and we 
would----
    Chair Brown. But they do not. You hope they do. You think 
they are responsible, but they are not. In many cases they do 
not tell the tenant. They just say no. Correct?
    Mr. Cartwright. Well again, it is difficult for me to speak 
comprehensively about the practices out there. What I can tell 
you is that we believe that it should be a transparent process, 
and we are, again, happy and willing to commit the resources to 
work with you to review the rules of the road and refine 
regulations as appropriate.
    Chair Brown. OK. Well, I hope then the best first step you 
can take is to support the provision in our bipartisan Eviction 
Crisis Act to clarify that tenants should be able, in fact, 
under law, to see their own tenant screening report whenever a 
landlord is using that report to decide about whether or not to 
rent to them. So we will come back to you about asking for your 
very public support for the Eviction Crisis Act.
    Senator Boyd Britt, of Alabama.
    Senator Boyd Britt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, 
and thank you to all three of you for appearing before this 
Committee this morning.
    I want to speak on a subject that Ranking Member Scott 
brought up, about credit-invisible individuals. Both the CFPB 
and many of your research--actually, Mr. Cassin, your research 
team as well--indicates that there is around 26 to 28 million 
Americans that are credit invisible. Actually, in Alabama, this 
is personal to me. One-fifth of Alabamians, according to the 
CFPB, are either credit invisible or have a thin credit file, 
and for lack of credit history. Research indicates that this is 
predominantly in low and rural consumers, and they are the ones 
that are fitting into this category.
    One of our bipartisan goals on this Committee is to 
responsibly increase access to financial institutions and to 
credit. I want to ask each one of you, given that many of these 
individuals do not have traditional credit histories, what is 
your plan to help more Americans no longer be credit invisible 
or to actually develop their credit history?
    And we will just go down the line, and since we are short 
on time, if you can keep it as concise as possible I would 
greatly appreciate it.
    Mr. Begor. Thank you, Senator. We are 100 percent aligned 
with your goal, and it has already come up in the hearing, 
around expanding access to credit. It is a priority of Equifax, 
and we have large databases that are alternative data outside 
of the credit file. For example, we have records on cellphone 
utility payment records for 220 million Americans, and we have 
rolled out a new product, a new mortgage credit file that 
includes those data elements that will expand credit scores by 
including those more nontraditional elements.
    Senator Boyd Britt. And are you seeing that help more 
people?
    Mr. Begor. For sure, and we are working to bring more data 
in, rental payment data, for example, the 44 million Americans 
that rent every month. That is very attractive data, very 
predictive data that will improve their credit score. So adding 
that data is a priority of ours.
    Senator Boyd Britt. Thank you. Mr. Cartwright.
    Mr. Cartwright. Thanks again for the question, Senator, and 
I agree with you. It is a hugely important issue, and in my 
opinion it is probably the single biggest issue that this 
Committee could work on to expand financial inclusion to the 
mainstream system.
    One point I would like to highlight for the Committee is 
that TransUnion and the credit reporting industry at large 
adopted what is called ``trended'' credit information over the 
past several years. And the difference is that prior to trended 
credit information we took a snapshot, a point-in-time view of 
a consumer's credit information to calculate a score.
    Now we look back over history, as much as 3 years of data. 
That allows us to include consumers who may have fallen off the 
credit file. As a result, the industry can score tens of 
millions of consumers that we could not previously, and score 
with greater accuracy, which is important to bank safety and 
soundness.
    I agree with Mr. Begor that we have got to invest in 
alternative data. We also, at TransUnion, have a considerable 
amount of nontraditional credit information that we use in our 
scoring algorithms, and it expands access to the financial 
system for American consumers.
    Senator Boyd Britt. Excellent. I hope you will continue to 
invest in that.
    Mr. Cartwright. We certainly will.
    Senator Boyd Britt. Mr. Cassin.
    Mr. Cassin. Thank you, Senator. This is a hugely important 
issue for the industry and it is a hugely important issue for 
Experian. We have been incredibly proactive on this topic.
    The first thing that we did some time ago was to make 
access to Experian credit reports and scores free to any 
consumer, and we now have over 65 million consumers that access 
those products directly from Experian, so they can go at any 
time and get access to lots of products, which give a lot of 
education around how reports and scores are calculated and how 
people can improve those.
    But we have gone further than that, Senator. We have 
introduced some specific products which really go to the heart 
of this issue. The first is called Experian Boost, which I 
mentioned in response to Senator Scott's question, and that is 
really a service which enables consumers, entirely free and 
entirely optional, to actually add those additional trade lines 
to the Experian credit file so that they can be included in 
their credit assessments. And as I said, over 12 million people 
have connected with Boost, and users who have completed the 
process have seen an average increase of 13 points to their 
FICO score. So we think that is a hugely positive development.
    The second thing we did was introduce our newest product, 
called Experian Go, which is actually aimed at those consumers 
who have no information on the credit file whatsoever, so that 
they can add these trade lines and establish a financial 
identity for the first time. And this is a hugely important 
step in trying to address this issue.
    So together I think all of the actions that we have taken, 
by making all of our products available to consumers for free, 
by introducing these products which are specifically geared 
toward
targeting this issue, I think we have been the most proactive 
on this topic, and we will continue to do so to work toward 
that.
    Senator Boyd Britt. I would agree, you have, and I want to 
commend you for the work that you have done, and I hope all 
three of you will continue to make sure that you are 
intentional in this effort. We have to make sure that more 
Americans have better opportunities to build their credit file.
    Additionally, I want to double down on what Ranking Member 
Scott said about financial literacy. It is critically 
important. And if each of you will report to my office what you 
are doing within your community to help us promote that across 
the country I would greatly appreciate that as well.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Britt.
    Senator Tester is recognized from his office, perhaps.
    Senator Tester. ----I appreciate it very, very much.
    Many Montanans have reached out to my office with 
complaints about difficulties receiving much-needed loans 
because their credit reports are frozen or suspended. With 
little face-to-face assistance from CRAs, folks feel that they 
are being held hostage by the CRAs.
    So for all of you, how will you help consumers quickly lift 
freezes on their credit reports?
    Mr. Begor. I will go first, Senator, I guess in 
alphabetical order here. We agree with your point around it is 
super important to give consumers access to their credit 
report. As I mentioned, Equifax has invested, over the last 
number of years, $75 million to improve that access. We are 
also expanding the education on our website in order to have 
consumers better understand what a credit score is, and what a 
credit report is, and how to improve your credit score.
    Senator Tester. Before we go to the next one. But for the 
freezes specifically, are you doing anything to help consumers 
lift the freezes?
    Mr. Begor. We are, Senator. We are making that process more 
streamlined. At Equifax we have an online app that is called 
Lock and Alert, where a consumer can lock their credit file and 
then automatically unlock that credit file. That is a free 
product. So it is definitely a priority of ours to make it 
easier to lift a freeze when a consumer puts it on there.
    Senator Tester. OK. Next.
    Mr. Cartwright. Senator Tester, thank you for the question. 
I agree, this process needs to be quick and seamless for 
consumers. Today there are two flavors of the process. A 
consumer can enact a credit freeze, which is a consumer's right 
under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It also takes a bit more 
time to freeze and unfreeze one's credit through these 
processes.
    TransUnion has also invested and innovated in an app and a 
credit lock product where consumers can lock and unlock access 
to their credit instantaneously, and that is what we are 
striving for. We are striving for a very seamless consumer 
experience.
    Mr. Cassin. And Senator, at Experian we make it available 
free to consumers to freeze and unfreeze their credit reports. 
We have actually just revamped that product. It is available 
through a mobile-optimized website. We believe it is very easy 
to do and should be quite intuitive for consumers to do it. And 
there is assistance to consumers if they are having any 
difficulty. So this should be a really easy process for 
consumers to do now.
    Senator Tester. I want to talk about data breaches for a 
second. They occur, and they occur in all sorts of different 
arenas, where folks get their identity stolen due to a data 
breach.
    For you, Mr. Begor, can you give me an idea on what is 
being done to help folks who have had their identity stolen due 
to a breach?
    Mr. Begor. We have a process where a consumer that has an 
identity issue, they can freeze their credit file if they have 
been a victim of an identity breach. Obviously they have access 
to free credit reports and can work with our team to really 
manage their credit exposure if they have been a victim of a 
data breach event.
    Senator Tester. So I do know about you guys but I get these 
cellphones, and I get phone calls at the most inopportune 
times, sometimes when I am asking important people questions, 
although it has not happened yet today. And they are from 
telemarketers. They are from folks who want to sell me 
something that I do not really give a damn if I buy it or not. 
I should be contacting them. They should not be contacting me. 
But nonetheless, it occupies a lot of my time and it is a real, 
genuine pain in the neck, or maybe even a pain somewhere else.
    So it is my understanding that folks that are trying to buy 
homes in Montana have expressed some frustration with an influx 
of advertisements and loan officers calling them directly after 
they have pulled their credit reports. Is this being done 
because you guys are selling this information to third-party 
entities without their consent, or do they give consent, or are 
you not selling the information at all to third parties, that 
are basically in the business of trying to make money, but 
contacting people that, quite frankly, we would contact them 
normally, if that was the case.
    It is for all of you.
    Mr. Cassin. Senator, I will go first. I think the product 
you are referring to is called mortgage triggers. It has been 
around for quite a long time. Consumers do have the opportunity 
to opt out of that. What happens is, is when consumers apply 
for a mortgage they get the opportunity to receive other 
offers. It was actually introduced quite a long time ago in 
conjunction with people in the mortgage industry, and over a 
long period of time people have actually benefited 
significantly from getting better offers in the process.
    Senator Tester. But they have the opportunity to opt out of 
that?
    Mr. Cassin. That is correct, Senator.
    Senator Tester. That is perfect. Is that a big deal, or it 
happens just with a phone call, or how is that done?
    Mr. Cassin. No, it is very easy to do, Senator. It may not 
be known by all consumers, but it is a very simple process to 
do.
    Senator Tester. How about the other two?
    Mr. Cassin. You can go on the Experian website, and the 
other bureaus as well. It is actually a relatively simple and 
straightforward process.
    Senator Tester. OK. Good.
    Mr. Cartwright. Senator, I would like to echo Mr. Cassin's 
comments. We have similar functionality, opt-out functionality 
through our different digital products, and they are easy to 
use. I think I should also mention that TransUnion has some 
unique capabilities in this area where we can display the brand 
of an incoming phone call, and we can identify whether that 
phone call is a so-called ``trusted call.'' And we are rolling 
these solutions out in the fall.
    Senator Tester. OK. I appreciate that. Mr. Begor.
    Mr. Begor. Senator, we have the same capability for a 
consumer to opt out from that marketing.
    Senator Tester. OK. I appreciate it, guys. Thank you very 
much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Tester.
    Senator Fetterman, of Pennsylvania, is recognized.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and gentlemen, 
I want to be clear that I am not putting you on the spot here. 
We just had some research that my team has come up with, and 
there appears to be a systematic bias in credit reporting. 
About 5,000 adults, more than half of Black Americans report 
having low or no credit score, Hispanics 41 percent, Whites 37 
percent, and Asian Americans 18 percent. And again, is that 
something that perhaps might sound accurate to you right now?
    Mr. Begor. Senator, there is a large population, too large, 
in the United States that have no credit score. Our math is 
that about 20 million Americans are not in the formal credit 
file. There are another 60 million Americans that have very few 
trade lines that are generally not scorable. So it is a large 
population. A big priority of ours is to use alternative data 
to help them get access to credit and develop a credit score 
and a credit report.
    Senator Fetterman. So you do not believe that there is an 
issue then?
    Mr. Begor. No, Senator, I agree completely. It is one of 
our priorities to focus on access to credit. We think it is a 
big issue, and it is one I know the Committee is focused on, 
and we are 100 percent aligned with the issue, and we are 
focused on using alternative data to address it.
    Senator Fetterman. OK. Well, are there any trends or 
patterns that you noticed about race and credit reports at all?
    Mr. Cassin. Well, Senator, perhaps I can add to that. 
Credit reports are not allowed to include any information, you 
know, protected characteristics, race, religion, ethnicity. So 
the reports are completely blind to those factors.
    I think what we are talking about here is the issue we 
discussed which is one of underrepresentation across many 
communities, and we do agree that is an issue. And as we have 
said in answers to questions from Senator Scott, that we 
believe that we have been very proactive in trying to address 
this issue, and we believe there is more we can do, and we will 
be very focused on making sure that we can improve access for 
everybody across the United States.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you.
    According to the FTC, active service members and their 
families are nearly three times more frequently victims of 
digital theft than other U.S. adults. You know, what are you 
able to do to protect the credit for all military families, 
both active duty and non-active duty, including the National 
Guard and Reserve from, say, higher-than-average financial 
fraud, particularly cybercrime?
    Mr. Cassin. Well, Senator, perhaps I can answer on behalf 
of Experian. We make our credit reports and scores free to all 
active service men and women and their families. So it is 
entirely accessible to them all the time.
    Mr. Cartwright. Senator, TransUnion does the same, and I 
think it bears repeating that at the beginning of the pandemic, 
as an industry, the credit bureaus went from providing 
consumers with one free credit report a year to one free credit 
report per week. And I think that is critical because we want 
consumers, and we certainly want active military personnel to 
be able to access their credit information and to benefit from 
free monitoring products.
    Mr. Begor. And Senator, the same with Equifax. You know, we 
have a program where the active service members have access to 
that information, and it is a priority of ours to support them.
    Senator Fetterman. And my last question. Transgender and 
nonbinary consumers face a myriad of credit reporting problems, 
if they change their names, including fragmented reports, among 
other issues. These problems can have devastating consequences. 
What steps have any of your agencies taken to prevent credit 
reporting problems for members of this community?
    Mr. Cartwright. Well, Senator, if I could start, the issue 
you raise is a very serious issue, and it is why, you know, at 
TransUnion, and we in the industry, we match consumers to 
credit records using a wide variety of criteria. There are 
often name variations. We have also got to look at Social 
Security numbers and phone numbers and a variety of addresses, 
and again, a broad range of criteria that ensure a high degree 
of matching accuracy.
    Mr. Begor. Similar, Senator. At Equifax we are focused on 
making the process, when a name change needs to take place, to 
make that seamless and easier for that individual to complete.
    Mr. Cassin. And Senator, just to complete, it is the same 
at Experian. We are doing similar processes.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you all. Thank you.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Fetterman.
    Senator Warren, of Massachusetts, when she sits down, is 
recognized for 5 minutes.
    Senator Warren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    So the three of you who are testifying here today are the 
CEOs of the largest credit reporting bureaus in the Nation. 
Your companies determine the creditworthiness of just about 
every person in our country, and you make money by collecting 
and selling information about an individual's past success in 
repaying their debts, the amount of money that they owe, and 
other factors that you claim predict the likelihood of repaying 
their debts going forward.
    So credit reports that you produce have big consequences 
for people's lives. If someone's credit report drops by, say, 
25 points, they could have a rental application turned down, 
they could be charged a higher price for a car loan, they could 
pay more for insurance, or they can even miss a chance at a new 
job. So it is really important that the data is right.
    Last year, over 100 million Americans had medical debt. 
CFPB research shows that medical collections are less 
predictive of consumers' future delinquency rates than 
nonmedical debt collections, and research by FICO finds that 
medical collections that have been paid--this one really gets 
me--the ones that have been paid are even less predictive of 
consumers' creditworthiness than unpaid medical collections.
    So Mr. Begor, you are the CEO of Equifax. Do you agree with 
the research showing that medical debt collections are not as 
good at predicting the likelihood of default as other kinds of 
debt like car loans, mortgages, and the like?
    Mr. Begor. Medical debt is a very complex topic, Senator. A 
lot of medical debt is not taken on willingly by consumers, so 
we appreciate the complexity of the medical debt as a complex--
--
    Senator Warren. That is not what I am asking you. I 
understand that it is complex. The question I am asking is its 
predictive value compared with, say, car loans, mortgages, and 
paying rent.
    Mr. Begor. It still has a predictive value, and the Senator 
knows that we took a proactive action to exclude medical debt 
under $500 as well as excluding----
    Senator Warren. I understand what you have already done. I 
will ask my question for a third time. Is it less predictive 
than other forms of paying your bills?
    Mr. Begor. It is still a predictive element in paying 
bills.
    Senator Warren. Is it less predictive than other forms of 
paying your bills?
    Mr. Begor. I do not have that information available to me.
    Senator Warren. You do not have that information available? 
Are you kidding me? You are the head of one of the biggest 
credit reporting agencies in the country, and you do not know 
the relative predictability of one of the major forms of debt 
that you report on?
    Mr. Begor. Senator, as I said----
    Senator Warren. Really? You expect me to believe that?
    Mr. Begor. Senator, as I said, we still believe it is 
predictive. We are continuing to look at it.
    Senator Warren. That was not the question. If you can say 
that it is predictive then I am shocked that you do not know 
how predictive it is compared to other forms of debt 
collection.
    Look, the reason that medical debt is a poor predictor of 
creditworthiness is our medical system is a mess. Most 
hospitals charge you one price, they charge insurance companies 
another, so medical bills are often a moving target. Bills are 
routinely sent to the wrong party. Often a patient cannot even 
figure out what it is in terms of supplies or services that 
they are being billed for.
    Studies, which I assume you would have read, show that as 
much as 80 percent of medical bills contain errors. The CFPB 
found that, quote, ``many medical bills reported on credit 
reports are disputed, inaccurate, and not owed,'' end quote. 
Some debt collectors have even stopped reporting medical bills 
to your companies because the data is so bad that they worry 
that they may be violating Federal consumer protection laws by 
reporting it.
    Last year, your companies made changes in how you handle 
medical debt, and those changes were good, but you fixed 
roughly about half the problem. Nearly half of the roughly 38 
million people with medical debt on their credit reports will 
be left in the same position as if your companies had done 
nothing. The CFPB has said that it will continue to assess 
whether unpaid medical debt should remain on Americans' credit 
reports at all.
    So, Mr. Begor, let me ask you this. If the CFPB were to 
conclude that data on medical debt is so full of errors that it 
does not belong on credit reports, would you support all credit 
reporting agencies removing it entirely?
    Mr. Begor. We are certainly prepared to collaborate with 
the CFPB----
    Senator Warren. That is not the question I asked you. Do 
you want me to repeat the question?
    Mr. Begor. No, that is not necessary, Senator. We would 
certainly support that.
    Senator Warren. All right. Thank you. Mr. Cartwright, what 
about you? If the CFPB concluded that this data was so 
problematic that it does not belong on credit reports, would 
TransUnion remove medical collections from consumers' reports?
    Mr. Cartwright. Senator, we would work with the CFPB----
    Senator Warren. That is not the question I asked. I am not 
asking you whether or not you want to work. I am saying if they 
conclude that the data is so problematic that it does not 
belong on credit reports, would TransUnion remove those data 
from consumers' reports?
    Mr. Cartwright. Senator, to be clear, the CFPB is our 
regulator, and if they were to direct us to remove the 
remainder of information, because the actions we have taken 
voluntary have removed 70 percent of consumer debt from the 
record, but if they directed us to do so we, of course, would 
comply.
    Senator Warren. All right. But I asked you a different 
question. The question I asked you is just a factual one. If 
they conclude that the data are so bad that they should not be 
listed on credit reports--I am not asking whether or not if 
they go ahead and put an order in place. If you had that 
information--Mr. Begor claims not even to know how bad medical 
debt reporting is--if you had that information from the CFPB, 
would TransUnion stop reporting it?
    Mr. Cartwright. Senator, we are committed to accurate and 
complete credit reporting of predictive----
    Senator Warren. So if the Federal Consumer Protection 
Agency said, ``These data are so inaccurate they should not be 
on credit reports,'' would you then remove them from the credit 
reports? It is a simple question, Mr. Cartwright. If you had 
this information from a Federal regulator, would you use that 
information in order to get rid of these data, take it off the 
reports?
    Mr. Cartwright. We would certainly act appropriate, and 
Senator, in the circumstance that you outline----
    Senator Warren. I am asking you. You are the CEO. Is it 
appropriate then to just take it off?
    Mr. Cartwright. Yeah, I find it difficult to believe that 
the CFPB would not issue guidance on the matter if that were 
indeed the results of their analysis.
    Senator Warren. So you are going to wait to be ordered. 
That is what you are saying? You do not do anything unless you 
are ordered to do it?
    Mr. Cartwright. What I am saying, Senator, is that we are a 
data-driven, analytic company----
    Senator Warren. Mr. Cassin, I am past my time. Let me turn 
to you. Would you support removing medical collections from 
Experian's credit report if the CFPB concluded that the data 
were so problematic they should not be on credit reports?
    Mr. Cassin. I understand the nuance of your question. I 
think, the first thing point I would say is if obviously CFPB 
directed it to us, of course we would comply with that. If the 
CFPB concluded that it was so problematic and that the industry 
also agreed that there was not an issue in removing that data 
from credit reports, then we would do so, too. But I think it 
is a complex issue, Senator, and I think it needs to be looked 
at in the broad.
    Senator Warren. You know, I apologize to the Chair for 
running over, and I understand that the credit reporting 
agencies are just the last link in a very problematic chain of 
actors, that hospitals and health systems and insurance 
companies and medical credit card issuers are all profiting 
form a business model of bogus and even illegal healthcare 
charges. And I would like to see those CEOs in front of us as 
well.
    But credit reporting agencies are the ones who turn all of 
that bad data into real pain for American consumers. You are 
the ones who cost them real money, more than just those bills, 
in every part of their lives. And it is time to start holding 
every link in this chain accountable, and that includes the 
credit reporting agencies.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Warren.
    Senator Britt is recognized for a second short round of 
questions, I believe.
    Senator Boyd Britt. Thank you. As you know, we had a 
hearing yesterday over the challenges of our housing industry. 
Many of the affordability issues in our housing industry come 
from record-high inflation that is crushing American families 
across the board. Rising prices have cost a typical household 
here in the United States over $10,000 since President Biden 
took office.
    I agree with Ranking Member Scott that we must expand home 
ownership to more Americans. Home ownership is especially 
central to families seeking to build intergenerational wealth 
and achieve their American dream.
    Mr. Begor, you talked about different ways additional and 
alternative data that you all were using to help in this area. 
Can you talk specifically about how you are working to assist 
more creditworthy families to accomplish the goal of home 
ownership?
    Mr. Begor. Thank you, Senator. We are very aligned with 
that goal around expanding access to credit and taking the 
credit invisible and moving them into the formal financial 
environment through the use of our alternative data and our 
technology. And one great example is a new mortgage credit 
report we rolled out a few weeks ago, where we are adding 
cellphone and utility payment data that will expand that credit 
file and result in as many as 2.4 million subprime consumers 
increasing their credit score by 30 points. So we are focusing 
on using alternative data to expand access to housing, the 
housing market.
    Senator Boyd Britt. Excellent, and I hope that you all 
continue to do that across the board.
    As you know too well, there have been increasing trends of 
pressuring credit reporting agencies to remove certain data 
from their reports. The accuracy of data you collect is used 
for fair pricing and access to credit for hundreds of millions 
of people. If we continue down the path of removing all 
different types of data from credit reports, I would like for 
each of you to speak to some of the potential consequences that 
that might create.
    Mr. Cartwright, go ahead.
    Mr. Cartwright. Well, Senator, if I can begin the 
discussion, at the outset, Ranking Member Scott talked about an 
era in financial services in this country where loan 
determinations were influenced by relationships, by community 
standard, by prior practices. It has been an enormous 
innovation, to the benefit of consumers, to have comprehensive 
and accurate and objective information reported at scale to the 
reporting agencies, so now the decisions are data-driven and 
they are unbiased.
    I feel like having a truthful and comprehensive record at 
the foundation of lending decision is critical. Nobody wins if 
the data is inaccurate. Nobody wins if the data is somehow 
cherry-picked or gerrymandered for a particular outcome. Our 
role is to be the custodians of this information, to ensure 
that it is accessible to consumers, and to ensure that they 
have got a fair process to review and dispute the information 
if it is inaccurate.
    But more information and information transparency, it 
drives better outcomes for consumers.
    Senator Boyd Britt. Mr. Cassin.
    Mr. Cassin. Yes, thank you, Senator. I think we touched 
upon this issue, and I think a perfect example would be, for 
example, Experian Boost, where we have given millions of 
consumers the opportunity to add additional data to their file. 
And the result of that is actually that they get access to 
better credit and more affordable credit.
    So really, the solution to this issue is to provide more 
data, not less, more accurate reflections of how consumers have 
repaid obligations on time, and to give consumers credit for 
that.
    I would add, Senator that we have also a lot of examples 
from across the world of different systems, and systems which 
have less information generally perform much, much poorer than 
systems which have more information. In the United States, we 
have one of the most competitive and dynamic credit economies 
in the world. Lots of countries seek to emulate that. And where 
we have less information it is generally worse outcomes.
    Senator Boyd Britt. The more information we have, it limits 
and mitigates the risk. Correct?
    Mr. Cassin. Correct.
    Senator Boyd Britt. OK. Mr. Begor.
    Mr. Begor. Senator, I would agree. More data results in 
better decisions for U.S. consumers, and complete and accurate 
data is what our financial and credit ecosystem is built on. 
And I would agree with your comment as well as Brian's that the 
U.S. credit system is the envy of the world, with the scale of 
our information, the depth of information that we have, and the 
access to credit that consumers have, but there is still so 
much more we can do around adding alternative data to really 
help those consumers that are not in the formal environment, 
and move them into it.
    Senator Boyd Britt. Absolutely. Yes.
    Mr. Cartwright. And Senator, if I could add one last point. 
Adding rental payment to the credit files, at scale, would 
materially drive home ownership in this country. If a consumer 
can make their rent payments consistently, they can make their 
mortgage payments, and if they qualify for a mortgage they can 
start to build generational wealth, as you pointed out.
    Senator Boyd Britt. Absolutely. And in conclusion, if there 
are potential CFPB announcements coming down the pipe I hope 
that those will be done in accordance with the notice and 
comment process that is required by law, and I hope you will 
all consider reliable, risk-based data, including all types of 
debt. As you know, they are important to the work that you do. 
The more data that we have, the more people have access to 
credit.
    Thank you for being here.
    Chair Brown. I thank the three of you for being here today. 
I appreciate your testimony, your commitment to work with this 
Committee. The Committee will ensure that you all do better, as 
you promised, and produce more fair and accurate credit reports 
for consumers.
    This is, I believe, the first time ever that the CEOs of 
the three large credit reporting agencies have been in front of 
this Committee, or I believe in front of Congress at all. This 
has been helpful today. This will not be the last time we do 
this.
    We talked a lot today about financial inclusion and access 
to credit. I want to reiterate that one important way to 
achieve this goal is to remove all medical debt from credit 
report. You heard every Senate Democrat in this room ask you 
about that, with passion, about how important that is. I do not 
think your answers were very direct.
    I think you know that medical debt is not predictive. We 
talked about a whole lot of reasons for that. I think you know 
that when medical debt is removed from credit reports, 
according to CFPB, the total amount of available revolving 
credit increased by over $1,000. You know what that means to 
low-income people. What you just said, Mr. Cartwright, about 
people creating generational wealth, if medical debt is 
removed, from a car accident or unexpected illness, as illness 
usually is, you know this will provide more people an ability 
to buy a home and build that equity and build that generational 
wealth. I could see from your answers you intuitively, all 
three of you, understand what that could mean.
    I mean, you do not meet, personally, a whole lot of low-
income people, I assume, in the United Kingdom or Atlanta or 
Chicago. CEOs rarely do. Senators rarely do, unfortunately. 
That is part of the problem with this place. But you know you 
will make the lives of a number of moderate- and low-income 
people who are struggling, better if you remove the medical 
debt. It increases credit scores by 32 points. That clearly is 
significant in the lives of a lot of people.
    If you want to increase financial inclusion and critical 
access I again urge you, urge you, urge you, as so many up here 
did, to remove medical debt from credit reports.
    For Senators who wish to submit questions for the hearing 
record, those questions are due 1 week from today, Thursday, 
May 4th. To the witnesses, please submit your responses to 
questions for the record no more than 45 days from the day that 
you receive them.
    With that, the hearing is adjourned. Thank you.
    [Whereupon, at 11:25 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
    [Prepared statements, responses to written questions, and 
additional material supplied for the record follow:]
               PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIR SHERROD BROWN
    The three witnesses today determine the financial futures of every 
American.
    Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion are the biggest credit reporting 
agencies. You have tremendous power over people's lives.
    The information you collect and put in people's credit reports 
determine whether people can get a mortgage or buy a car; what interest 
rate they pay; what credit cards they can get, at what rate; whether 
they'll get insurance and what they pay for it; whether they'll be able 
to rent an apartment; whether they'll be accepted for a job.
    These companies are not just keepers of consumer data. They 
essentially manage--or mismanage, as the case may be--Americans' 
financial reputations.
    When your reports matter this much, with consequences this drastic, 
it's important you get them right.
    It is vital that these reports contain only information that's 
useful and fair and, above all, accurate.
    In 2017 when Equifax experienced a massive data breach, the 
American public was shocked to find out exactly how much credit 
reporting agencies are involved in their lives. The company compromised 
the personal information of more than 147 million consumers--including 
their Social Security numbers.
    Millions of people were forced into a crash course on how 
frustrating it can be to deal with credit reporting companies when they 
make a mistake.
    They had to place a credit freeze, they had to request their credit 
report, they were told to constantly monitor their information for 
inaccuracies.
    People are busy enough with their kids and their jobs and their 
lives--they shouldn't have to spend that kind of time, because some 
company they've never heard of screwed up.
    The data breach affected millions of people at once and got a lot 
of attention. But that was far from the only case of costly mistakes by 
your companies.
    Today, credit reports are riddled with errors.
    According to a Federal Trade Commission study, 1-in-5 consumers had 
errors in at least one of their three credit reports, and 1-in-20 had 
errors that affected the likelihood of receiving credit or affected the 
credit rate.
    More than 200 million Americans are in the Experian, Equifax, and 
TransUnion credit reporting system. That means that potentially 40 
million consumers have errors on their credit reports.
    In a 2022 report, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also 
found that Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion routinely failed to 
adequately respond to consumers with errors in their reports.
    After this report, the three credit reporting agencies instituted 
some reforms to better respond to consumer complaints about errors on 
their credit reports.
    It's an important, though long overdue, first step.
    But errors like mixed files, where the information of a different 
consumer appears on a credit file, are still far too common.
    Mixed files are such a pervasive problem that, in 2015, 30 
Attorneys General settled a lawsuit with the three credit reporting 
agencies over this problem. Among other reforms, the credit reporting 
agencies were required to establish minimum standards for matching 
criteria and reducing mixed files.
    And it's more than just mixed-up files. Some people--still very 
much alive--are declared dead. They have their identity stolen. The 
list goes on.
    Errors are also introduced into this system by what are called 
``furnishers,'' companies supplying information to the credit reporting 
agencies.
    Debt collectors are some of the worst offenders when it comes to 
supplying wrong information.
    The CFPB found that, even though debt collectors supply just 13 
percent of the accounts to credit reports, they are responsible for 40 
percent of the disputes on credit reports.
    Americans can be dinged on their reports for debts they do not even 
owe.
    It's not just errors that do not belong on credit reports.
    Medical debt in particular has absolutely no place on credit 
reports.
    In 2022, in the United States, an estimated 43 million Americans 
held $88 billion dollars of medical debt on their credit reports.
    Low-income families, Black and Hispanic households, veterans, and 
older Americans are hit particularly hard.
    But medical debt can happen to anyone. It doesn't matter if you do 
everything right.
    Anyone can get sick. Anyone can get in a car accident. It has 
nothing to do with your ability to pay your bills--or it shouldn't.
    Medical debt does not correlate with credit risk--it correlates 
with illness.
    No one should have their financial future destroyed because of a 
medical emergency, or a sick family member.
    It's why I am asking your companies to stop putting medical debt on 
these reports. And after increasing scrutiny and pressure, 1 year ago, 
Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion all announced they would 
significantly change how medical collection debt is reported.
    One of the major reforms announced is the removal of all medical 
debts of $500 or below from credit reports.
    This is a positive first step, but it is not enough.
    If you have $1,000 in medical debt, you're no less creditworthy 
than someone with $500. It stems from the same problem--someone in your 
family or you got sick.
    The CFPB found that the remaining medical debt on credit reports 
will disproportionately belong to consumers living in majority minority 
and lower-income neighborhoods.
    Your companies also provide tenant screening services--another way 
you have tremendous power over people's lives . . . and another way 
your errors can have disastrous consequences.
    When tenant screenings turn up erroneous eviction filings, people 
can't rent a home.
    And because tenant screening reports aren't as available as regular 
credit reports, renters may cycle through rejection after rejection, 
without ever knowing there's an error.
    After pressing the CFPB to address these errors in tenant screening 
reports, I was glad to see the CFPB and Federal Trade Commission 
announce a Request for Information on how background screenings, like 
tenant screening reports, affect renters' ability to obtain housing.
    Just yesterday, this Committee held a hearing about the challenges 
Americans face affording housing. In a highly competitive housing 
market, inaccurate data mean renters lose out on a home.
    It's hard enough for Americans to get a foothold in the middle 
class. The last thing workers should have to contend with are careless 
mistakes from companies that have too much power over some of the most 
important aspects of their lives.
    It is vital that the reports that your companies issue be accurate, 
not include medical debts, and that errors be fewer and correctable.
    I don't think it's a lot to ask.
                                 ______
                                 
                PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR TIM SCOTT
    Thank you to the witnesses for being here with us this morning. 
Such a really important topic, one that we've worked on for the last 5 
years of my time in the Senate, making sure that we have access to the 
best credit we can get based on someone being creditworthy.
    I say that because I look back at my own family's history back to 
the 1920s and 1930s when my grandfather was growing up in the Jim Crow 
South, where getting a loan had more to do with your relationships, not 
to do with your credit worthiness. And so when we move towards a model 
that allows people to access credit based on their relationships, it 
can sometimes lead to discrimination. But when we have an objective 
standard that is applied to everyone fairly and consistently, the 
Nation is a better place. Accessing credit, accessing the American 
Dream through home ownership is more realistic based on your 
creditworthiness.
    My story continues in a very similar direction as my grandfather's 
did. In the 1990s when I was starting my small business, I went to a 
bank and had a conversation with a banker about assets versus 
liabilities, and at that point, my best asset was a 1990 [Nissan] 240SX 
that had 253,000 miles on it. Not necessarily the definition of an 
asset, but I tried to use it to borrow some money against it, and the 
bank rightly laughed me out of the bank.
    But I did develop a relationship where we had an opportunity to 
look at my very light credit score. I didn't have much credit at all. 
And so that works against you when you're trying to start a new small 
business. And if you need a revolving line of credit, banks are less 
likely to loan against no assets--the ability to come back and forth to 
the same institution. So that is a challenge. But the more I worked 
with a banker to appreciate building that credit score, understanding 
the principles that are so important to American prosperity, I was able 
to achieve my goal of opening my first Allstate insurance agency with 
the help of a friend who put some money into the business as well as a 
bank that finally concluded that I was an
appropriate risk.
    That situation today manifests in different ways, in that the 
credit score now impacts your rates and your insurance business. And 
having been in the business of insurance, your auto insurance, your 
home insurance--not just your loans--are literally decided by your 
creditworthiness. And because of that, I think we have to do everything 
in our power to make sure that as we head towards and continue to make 
progress on our risk-based method, it takes the subjective nature out 
of lending that relied only on relationships, reputation, or word of 
mouth, and in turn created, in my opinion, a fairer, objective measure 
of creditworthiness, increasing access to credit, and frankly, making 
it more inclusive as well.
    This is so important because with hard work and responsible 
financial decisions, anyone can develop and improve their credit score 
and obtain access to credit in a manner that represents their financial 
opportunity. Increasing taxpayer-backed risk in the housing market as 
this Administration's economic policies push us toward a recession is 
anything other than ``equitable.''
    At the same time, the CFPB has the audacity to announce it's 
exploring new avenues of regulatory overreach on whole numbers of 
different issues, ranging from data privacy to late payment fees, 
despite the fact that the agency itself experienced a data breach 
exposing the information of more than 250,000 Americans and then [hid] 
that breach for several weeks. [It's] so amazing how tirelessly this 
Administration works to put dollars on the sidelines instead of in 
taxpayers' pockets. I look forward to getting answers and holding 
Director Chopra responsible. At the end of the day, the data that 
lenders use becomes less secure, [and] less reliable and predictive. It 
will simply result in higher rates and fewer loans made to people at 
the margins of the credit box, people just like me. Yet another example 
of the Biden administration's policies hurting the people who can 
afford it the least.
    However, there is good news. American innovation and free market 
competition are creating new avenues towards prosperity. As technology 
develops and lenders are able to use new or alternative sources of data 
to better predict the risk of default, ``credit invisible'' Americans 
will increasingly be able to participate in our financial markets, and 
that's really good news. Common sense and technological innovation 
[have] the potential to bring an estimated 50 million Americans with 
thin or no credit files into the financial system--a goal I have been 
working on, as I said at the beginning, for years.
    My Credit Access and Inclusion Act, the Building Credit Access for 
Veterans Act, and finally, the Credit Score Competition Act, which was 
signed into law in 2018, are all designed to allow for the use of new, 
reliable, predictive data in our system. As we push forward with these 
improvements in technology and new sources of data, which are already 
showing promise at making our markets fairer and more accessible, we 
should also consider what guardrails may be needed to ensure 
responsible growth and consumer protection.
    I look forward to hearing from the witnesses today on this really 
important topic and look forward to asking you some questions, as well.
                                 ______
                                 
                  PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARK W. BEGOR
                           CEO, Equifax Inc.
                             April 27, 2023
    Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott and distinguished Members of 
the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I am 
Mark Begor, and since April 2018 I have served as the Chief Executive 
Officer of Equifax. Over the past 5 years, my focus has been to build a 
New Equifax with a corporate culture that values and supports 
consumers, customers, and our communities and that is governed by a 
commitment to industry-leading cybersecurity practices for the 
protection of data in our stewardship. I recognize the important role 
Equifax plays in the financial lives of consumers and I take this 
responsibility very seriously.
    Our company's purpose is to help people live their financial best, 
and Equifax strives to put consumers first and support economically 
healthy individuals and financially inclusive communities. Putting 
consumers first and supporting financial inclusion is at our core, and 
Equifax is committed to helping people and small businesses access 
useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their 
needs--including payments, savings, credit, insurance and Government 
benefits--delivered in a responsible and sustainable way. We know that 
every financial first--whether it's a first job, college education, 
bank account, credit card, car loan, apartment lease, small business 
loan, Government benefit or mortgage--can spur positive economic 
change. To help power more of these financial firsts, Equifax has 
invested billions of dollars into unique data, verification insights, 
fraud reduction tools,
powerful modeling techniques and industry-leading, cloud-based 
technology solutions that empower our customers to bring greater access 
to financial opportunity to more people in more places.
    Today, I would like to discuss our commitments in a number of 
critical areas: promoting financial inclusion through Equifax 
innovation and differentiated data, being consumer friendly at every 
touchpoint, ensuring that our data is as accurate as possible, using 
data responsibly, and keeping the data entrusted to us secure and 
helping our customers innovate faster with more comprehensive insights 
into the people and communities they serve.
Equifax Is Using Its Differentiated Data To Expand Access to Credit for 
        More Consumers
    We know we play a critical role in the financial ecosystem of the 
United States. Last year, we helped 13.4 million people secure a 
mortgage or home equity loan, 31.1 million car buyers obtain a loan, 
100.1 million people get approved for a credit or retail card, and 8.2 
million students access a loan to further their education. We also 
fulfilled 45 million verifications to support the administration of 
Government assistance programs. While traditional credit data remains a 
strong indicator of credit history and past financial reliability, we 
know that one of the keys to responsibly expanding consumer access to 
credit and supporting a more inclusive economy is leveraging expanded 
Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) compliant information that is not 
traditionally included in a credit report.
    We constantly look for ways to continue to expand access to 
underserved consumers who may not have access to mainstream financial 
services products. About 80 million U.S. consumers are either credit 
invisible with no credit file or have a thin file which limits their 
access to the formal financial marketplace. Our research shows that 
leveraging alternative data sources could help these consumers become 
scorable or obtain lower cost financial products, and we are committed 
to making that happen. For example, we recently became the first in our 
industry to provide telecommunications, pay TV and utilities attributes 
to the mortgage industry to help streamline the mortgage underwriting 
process and provide a more complete picture of consumers' financial 
profiles. The majority of American adults have at least one utility or 
cell phone bill in their name. Delivering these telecommunications, pay 
TV and utilities attributes to mortgage lenders alongside traditional 
credit reports can help create greater home ownership opportunities for 
more than 191 million U.S. consumers, 80 percent of whom have 
traditional credit files but who may benefit from additional insights 
into their financial profile. Using this additional data could raise 
the credit scores of as many as 2.4 million subprime consumers by an 
average of 30 points, moving them into the near-prime score band and 
potentially enabling them to receive more favorable offers or rates.
    We are further promoting financially inclusive lending with the 
recent launch of OneScore, a unique new consumer credit scoring model 
that combines traditional credit history with telecommunications, pay 
TV and utility payment data on over 191 million consumers, as well as 
Equifax DataX and Teletrack specialty finance data on 80 million 
consumers--including payment history from nontraditional banks and 
lenders. The power of this combined data has the potential to increase 
credit scores by up to 25 points and the scorable population by more 
than 20 percent. Powered by advanced analytics and machine learning, 
OneScore is able to score an estimated 8.8 million more credit-seeking 
consumers than when compared to traditional scoring models. In 
addition, approximately 15 percent--or 6.3 million--more applicants 
that are considered subprime, no hit or thin file could be approved for 
a near prime or prime financial product without increasing risk when 
OneScore is used in combination with a traditional risk score.
    We are continuing to invest in alternative data that supports 
financial inclusion and expands access to credit by dedicating more 
resources to the reporting of renters' on-time housing payments. Recent 
studies have shown that approximately 44 million households rent their 
home or apartment and that 30 percent of the median U.S. income is 
required to pay the average rent, making rental payment reporting an 
important but under-utilized tool in building the credit history of 
credit thin or credit invisible consumers. We are partnering with the 
Credit Builders Alliance, a nonprofit network that connects equity-
focused nonprofits and credit bureaus, to help housing providers 
develop and implement rent reporting initiatives and we are 
strengthening our partnerships with rent aggregators to enable 
landlords to report rental payments, as well as exploring opportunities 
to expand the inclusion of consumer-permissioned rental data in credit 
files. In addition, through the Equifax Foundation, we are partnering 
with organizations in Atlanta and St. Louis that provide financial 
empowerment services to underserved consumers in low-to-moderate-income 
communities as a means of decreasing the racial wealth gap. Equifax 
understands that poverty and lack of generational wealth can adversely 
affect a person's entire lifetime as well as the lives of future 
generations. Building financial capability is a critical step to 
establishing individual financial health and generational wealth that 
can change the trajectory and livelihood of families and communities. 
All of these initiatives are aligned with our purpose of helping people 
live their financial best.
Equifax Is Striving To Be Consumer Friendly at Every Touch Point
    In addition to our efforts to expand access to credit, Equifax is 
taking strong steps to be more consumer friendly at every touch point. 
Over the past 5 years, we have invested over $75 million to make it 
easier for consumers to interact with us, including accessing their 
credit report or credit score online and making Spanish-language credit 
reports available online and by mail.
    We are improving the overall experience that consumers have with 
Equifax by ensuring that our written communications are in plain 
language; we have added tools like video clips to our website to help 
consumers navigate the dispute process; and we have made it easier for 
consumers to both manage their disputes online and track their dispute 
through the process. We are committed to correcting errors on consumer 
credit reports quickly and transparently and are working with our 
colleagues at the other nationwide consumer reporting agencies (NCRAs) 
to improve our shared backend data furnishing processes to further 
limit errors.
    To further support the financial health of consumers, we have 
improved the MyEquifax consumer portal, which offers free consumer 
credit reports and free credit scores each month as well as access to 
new financial offers and services, helping to simplify processes like 
finding auto loans. About 17 million people have leveraged the services 
offered through MyEquifax since its inception. Additionally, we have 
made it a focus to strengthen our educational web material. In 2022, we 
published 50 percent more articles and videos to our online Consumer 
Knowledge Center, with new content published two-to-three times per 
week. This Consumer Knowledge Center now contains more than 350 
educational resources on topics ranging from how credit decisions 
impact credit scores to identity theft.
    We also work collaboratively with the other NCRAs to support 
consumers. During the COVID-19 pandemic Equifax, along with Experian 
and TransUnion, expanded the offering of free credit reports to 
consumers each week, so that when times were uncertain and payment 
plans were being offered, consumers could make sure arrangements they 
negotiated were appropriately reflected in their credit reports. We 
believe this helped people focus on their personal wellbeing, health, 
and families throughout the pandemic. These reports remain available 
free of charge through the end of 2023.
    The NCRAs further collaborated on the reporting of medical 
collection debt on consumer credit reports with the understanding that 
most medical debt is generally not taken on voluntarily. Effective 
April 2023, medical collection debt with an initial reported balance of 
under $500 has been removed from U.S. consumer credit reports. With 
this change nearly 70 percent of the total medical collection debt 
tradelines reported to the NCRAs are now removed from consumer credit 
files. This announcement follows the changes that we jointly made in 
2022 to remove paid medical collection debt from U.S. consumer credit 
reports and to increase the time period before unpaid medical 
collection debt appears on a consumer's report from 6 months to 1 year, 
\1\ giving consumers more time to work with insurance and/or healthcare 
providers to address their debt before it is listed on their credit 
file. All of these actions are aligned with our goal of putting 
consumers first.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \1\ The March 2015 National Consumer Assistance Plan (NCAP) 
announced after the nationwide consumer reporting agencies reached 
agreement with over 30 State attorneys general required the removal of 
all medical debt that had been reported but was later paid by insurance 
companies. NCAP also prohibited the reporting of medical collection 
debt for at least 180 days.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equifax Is Ensuring That Our Data Is as Accurate as Possible
    Another element of our focus on consumers is ensuring that we 
maintain the most accurate data possible. This effort requires strong 
data stewardship. Even a single error on a consumer's credit report is 
one error to many. It is a personal priority for me that consumers 
trust their credit reports to contain the most accurate and complete 
data possible.
    The NCRAs operate under a robust regulatory environment governed by 
the Fair Credit Reporting Act \2\ (FCRA) and subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau, State attorneys general, and State banking 
regulators. Under the FCRA, consumer reporting agencies, as well as 
data furnishers and users of consumer reports such as banks, must meet 
stringent requirements regarding accuracy and permissible use of the 
data. If a consumer disputes the accuracy of any information in their 
credit report, for example, consumer reporting agencies are required to 
conduct a reasonable reinvestigation within statutory timeframes. \3\ 
Additionally, Equifax monitors data furnishers to ensure they are 
meeting Equifax's and industry standards. If a data furnisher is not 
compliant, Equifax will implement a remediation plan and ultimately 
terminate the data furnisher if the issues are not corrected. We 
believe our procedures meet our statutory obligations and we will 
continue to strive for the highest possible levels of accuracy to 
benefit consumers and the lending institutions that rely on this 
information to offer fair and affordable financial products.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \2\ 15 U.S.C. 1681, et seq.
     \3\ 15 U.S.C. 1681i.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Consumers may submit disputes through mail, over the telephone, or 
through our online channel. In the event of disputed accuracy of an 
item on a credit file, Equifax conducts a reinvestigation that includes 
working with the identified data furnisher if appropriate to determine 
whether the disputed information is inaccurate. Communications between 
Equifax and the data furnisher are conducted through an online web 
service called the Online Solution for Complete and Accurate Reporting 
(e-OSCAR). Once the data furnisher completes its investigation and 
returns those results, Equifax will make necessary updates to the 
credit file, if any, and communicate those results to the consumer. 
Equifax will also send notification back to the data furnisher 
confirming any credit file maintenance actions that may have occurred.
    I am driving further industry-leading enhancements to our accuracy 
program in the areas of automation, communication, and proactive 
correction.

    1. We are leveraging our Cloud investment to automate more 
processes to quickly identify potential accuracy issues, including 
where data submitted to us by our furnishers is illogical or 
inconsistent with other data that we have received. This will allow us 
to screen illogical conditions and anomalies before data is included in 
consumer credit files.

    2. We are establishing feedback loops to communicate the issues we 
identify and work with our furnishers to ensure they identify the root 
cause of inaccurate reporting and correct it going forward. We have a 
team dedicated to working directly with our furnishers on these issues, 
which will not only improve data accuracy at Equifax, but across the 
credit reporting ecosystem.

    3. We are building processes to analyze data furnished to us and 
data updated as a result of disputes to identify trends and potential 
errors in reporting. This will allow Equifax to proactively reach out 
to our furnishers to correct reporting errors before the information in 
consumer files is disputed.

    While I am proud of the progress that we have made in this area, 
there is more that we can and will do. We are deeply committed to 
putting consumers first, and that means ensuring that we are providing 
lenders accurate information so that consumers can get the credit they 
need. Our accuracy obligations to consumers are also supported by our 
market incentive to provide the most accurate data possible to our 
customers so that they can assess risk and offer financial products and 
services on the most appropriate terms.
Equifax Is Committed to Responsibly and Appropriately Using Personal 
        Data
    In addition to a strong data accuracy program, Equifax is committed 
to responsibly and appropriately using personal data. Five principles 
form the foundation of our data privacy program:

  1.  Equifax leverages quality data to drive progress. We are 
        committed to maintaining and using data that is accurate, 
        relevant, and timely.

  2.  Equifax takes its data stewardship responsibilities seriously. We 
        are transparent about how we use and safeguard data in our 
        possession.

  3.  Equifax believes in discretion of data. We share data only for 
        legitimate purposes, respecting the importance of data in the 
        lives of individuals.

  4.  Equifax exercises due diligence in its partnerships when we share 
        or receive data. We evaluate both sources and recipients of 
        data for alignment with our values.

  5.  Equifax has taken a designing for privacy approach. We take 
        privacy into consideration as we grow our products, services, 
        and standards.

    Equifax believes in being transparent about the collection, use and 
storage of personal data. For example, in the United States, Equifax 
publishes a single consolidated privacy statement and updates it 
regularly to be transparent about how we collect, use, and share data. 
Our privacy statement also details how consumers can exercise control 
over their data.
    In accordance with these principles of data use, Equifax offers 
solutions to help our customers make data-driven decisions. These 
solutions include providing data to help employers make informed 
personnel decisions about potential employees and to help credentialed 
property managers make more informed decisions and get rental 
applicants into safe and quality housing faster. If an employer uses 
background checks in making personnel decisions, the employer must 
comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and laws that protect people 
from discrimination. Employers rely on consumer reporting agencies and 
others throughout the hiring process to provide them with information 
they need to make informed decisions about a potential candidate, 
including verification of employment history or credit information. 
Equifax's employment screening reports do not contain credit scores. 
Equifax's tenant screening business is predominantly driven through 
resellers to whom we provide credit report information from one or more 
nationwide consumer reporting agencies, credit scores from VantageScore 
<SUP>'</SUP> or FICO <SUP>'</SUP>, income and employment information 
from The Work Number <SUP>'</SUP>, or Equifax digital identity and 
fraud authentication products.
Equifax Has Invested Substantially in Technology To Help Our Customers 
        Innovate and To Keep the Data Entrusted to Us More Secure
    To enable all of these advances, Equifax has invested an 
incremental more than $1.5 billion over the last 5 years to undertake a 
complete technology transformation to the most advanced Cloud 
capabilities available. This is one of the largest cloud technology 
investments ever undertaken in our industry and is changing nearly 
every facet of our infrastructure and capabilities. The Equifax Cloud 
<SUP>TM</SUP> is expanding the depth and accuracy of our data to help 
our customers innovate faster and create more effective insights into 
the people and communities they serve so that they can deliver better 
outcomes for consumers. Our industry-leading cloud transformation has 
created an agile new foundation for the enterprise to develop solutions 
that are faster, more reliable, more powerful, and more secure than 
ever before. In 2022, we harvested the power of our new Equifax Cloud 
<SUP>TM</SUP> capabilities and differentiated data to deliver more than 
100 new products guided by our purpose of helping people to live their 
financial best.
    We are aggressively working to complete this transformation. And, 
as we transform, we continue to focus on our leadership in data 
security and to build a culture where data security is central to our 
global team's DNA. From our employee engagement to our technology 
infrastructure, data fabric and product development, security is 
embedded in everything we do. Over the last 5 years, we have built one 
of the world's most advanced and effective cybersecurity programs. Our 
security capabilities exceed all major industry benchmarks, with 
Equifax ranked in the top 1 percent of Technology companies and top 3 
percent of Financial Services companies analyzed for three consecutive 
years. Our migration to the Equifax Cloud <SUP>TM</SUP> gives us more 
robust visibility into the security across our enterprise, which in 
turn enables us to detect and respond to threats with more speed and 
precision. In 2022, we effectively responded to 39 million cyber 
threats per day while conducting more than 374,000 simulations to test 
our global workforce and preparing for the future.
    Transparency has been critical to the growth and strength of our 
security program. We believe that more communication, more 
collaboration, and more transparency, with all companies delivers 
stronger security. Actively sharing the best practices we've gained as 
we work to implement change is why we developed our Security Annual 
Report, and why we have continued to actively engage with customers, 
policymakers, and other organizations, regarding the challenges and 
opportunities in cybersecurity on a daily basis.
    As part of our Equifax Cloud <SUP>TM</SUP> transformation, we have 
launched a state-of-the-art FedRAMP security environment to support our 
U.S. Government programs in the Cloud. We also developed Cloud-Control, 
a platform that gives our customers real-time visibility into the 
security of their Equifax Cloud <SUP>TM</SUP> products and services. We 
also are committed to industry collaboration, as further evidenced by 
the appointment of our Chief Information Security Officer as a 
Strategic Engagement Advisor to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI). In this role, our CISO will support the FBI's efforts to 
strengthen their relationship with the private sector and will support 
the Bureau in addressing the range of cyber threats facing businesses 
across America.
Equifax Has a Dedicated and Diverse Workforce Committed To Helping 
        People Live Their Financial Best
    And at the heart of delivering all of this progress is our people. 
At Equifax, we value our people and recognize that our employees drive 
our progress, innovation, and contributions to our communities. Equifax 
employs approximately 14,000 employees in 24 countries and more than 
7,000 in the United States. We believe that increasing diversity and 
inclusion leads to higher levels of innovation for our customers and 
consumers, strong engagement levels and ultimately better business 
outcomes. We have consistently improved enterprise-wide trends around 
representation and promotions for both women and employees of diverse 
ethnic backgrounds, and pride ourselves on promoting and hiring highly 
qualified candidates who enhance our culture, add diverse perspectives, 
and deliver on our business strategy. Within our senior leadership 
team, nearly 60 percent identify as female or as having a diverse 
racial or ethnic background, 45 percent of the Equifax global workforce 
identify as female, and 4 of our 10 Board members are female. 
Consistent with our commitment to diversity, we have expanded the 
requirements for diverse candidate interview slates for all 
professional and management roles.
    Thank you for the opportunity to share some of the key priorities 
of the New Equifax. While we still have more work to do, I am proud of 
the transformation we have made over the past 5 years. Equifax remains 
committed to putting consumers first at every touchpoint, to promoting 
financial inclusion through innovation and differentiated data, to 
ensuring that our data is as accurate as possible, using data 
responsibly, keeping the data entrusted to us secure and to helping our 
customers innovate faster with more comprehensive insights into the 
people and communities they serve. Our resolve to achieve our company 
purpose to help people live their financial best has never been 
stronger.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to provide this testimony and 
for your dedication to your constituents and American consumers.

               PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHRIS A. CARTWRIGHT
                     President and CEO, TransUnion
                             April 27, 2023
    Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and distinguished Members of 
the Committee, thank you for your invitation to appear. My name is 
Chris Cartwright, and it has been my great privilege to serve as 
President and CEO of TransUnion for the last 4 years.
    TransUnion is a global company headquartered in Chicago and best 
known as one-of-three major credit reporting agencies in the United 
States. We have nearly 5,000 employees in the United States, and more 
than 12,000 worldwide. As a company, our mission is to help people and 
society through information, to ensure fairness for consumers in the 
marketplace and to assist businesses in identifying underserved 
communities and managing business risks.
The Role of Credit Reporting Agencies
    The credit reporting agencies are the backbone of the modern 
consumer credit economy in the United States. We play an important role 
in the efficient and stable functioning of the Nation's financial 
system, serving as clearinghouses and record-keepers for information 
and helping consumers gain access to credit quickly and efficiently. We 
do not make lending decisions; rather, we provide objective information 
that helps consumers obtain credit and helps lenders in underwriting 
and establishing credit terms.
    We also help consumers find the right products to achieve their 
financial goals through available and affordable credit. Our credit 
reports help more than 254 million consumers obtain credit products 
each year. Prior to the advent of credit reporting agencies, lenders 
relied on existing relationships and personal knowledge, which often 
resulted in implicit or explicit bias in lending decisions. We serve 
consumers and lenders by providing objective data to help facilitate 
today's lending decisions.
    Today's consumers expect near instant access to credit, which 
TransUnion facilitates through high-quality credit reports: today 
people can walk into a car dealership and drive away in a new car in a 
matter of minutes. The Nation's credit reporting system makes this 
possible by providing an efficient and reliable way for lenders to 
assess consumers' willingness and ability to repay their loans. This 
system enhances consumers' quality of life and strengthens the American 
economy.
As a provider of credit data, our work touches the lives of nearly 
every American and particularly impacts those most in need of expanding 
opportunities through credit.
    We play a similarly important role for the lending community--
helping banks and financial institutions of all sizes accurately 
understand and manage risk. We work with small community banks and 
credit unions, with community development financial institutions, and 
with larger firms. Our risk analytics allow lenders of all sizes to 
expand access to credit for consumers while protecting financial 
stability. As we have seen in the past several weeks, ensuring lending 
institutions have the data required to understand and mitigate risk is 
critical to the overall health and resilience of the U.S. banking 
sector and financial stability more broadly.
Commitment to Accuracy
    At the core of TransUnion's business is a commitment to data 
accuracy. Nobody wins when consumer data is inaccurate--not us, not 
lenders, and certainly not the American consumer. We believe empowering 
consumers is fundamental to data accuracy and contributes to the 
overall health of the credit reporting system. TransUnion is committed 
to data accuracy across all of our businesses. TransUnion has led the 
industry in building a dispute-resolution system that helps consumers 
quickly address any errors or inaccuracies in their credit files. We 
provide tools for consumers to work with data furnishers, the lenders, 
and other entities that report information concerning financial 
obligations. We want consumers to be able to work with TransUnion 
easily, with no friction, and at no cost to resolve any errors on their 
credit reports. Through our efforts, our turnaround time in addressing 
consumer disputes is now approximately 9 days, well below the 30-day 
requirement of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). When a consumer 
believes a data furnisher inaccurately reports information, we 
facilitate the FCRA-mandated investigatory process and, if data is 
incorrect, we provide a system-wide update to the furnisher and other 
CRAs. We regularly measure furnisher performance and provide insights 
regarding furnisher data quality to the CFPB.
    We are working closely with the CFPB to make pro-consumer changes 
to our tenant and employment screening business, including improving 
our matching logic, only accepting data that is refreshed every 60-days 
by municipalities and vendors, and reporting only the final outcomes of 
eviction proceedings. TransUnion is committed to making sure tenant 
screening data is accurate; inaccurate data doesn't help anyone--not 
tenants or property owners. Screening plays an important role in 
enabling tenants to get housing opportunities; our data is an important 
tool to help property owners expand opportunity and protect the 
physical safety of their tenants. The data we receive is generally very 
accurate; it is based on thousands of court records from around the 
country, and we work hard to match that data correctly.
Expanding Economic Opportunities for All
    Financial inclusion is another key pillar of our company strategy, 
and we continuously seek ways to develop products and resources for the 
credit underserved--be it Americans living in rural communities, 
communities of color that have been historically disadvantaged, or 
those in the lowest-income bracket. Expanding credit access is not only 
good for the economy--it is the right thing to do to open up economic 
opportunities for all Americans.
    One of the ways TransUnion facilitates access to fair and equitable 
credit is through our industry-leading alternative data solutions. 
These tools provide potential lenders with the best, most accurate view 
of the consumer. Alternative data sources--such as rental and utility 
data--come with the added benefit of allowing people to build their 
credit profiles more quickly. Alternative data also supports market 
competition, allowing smaller and community-focused lenders to access 
consumers who may otherwise have been beyond their underwriting reach. 
Last year, TransUnion commissioned a market study of credit union 
executives from across major metropolitan and rural regions of the 
United States and found that ``credit unions want to be more inclusive 
and take more calculated risks.'' The study noted that ``[t]he current 
economic environment has also driven many financial institutions to 
shift their underwriting models to include trended and alternative data 
versus legacy credit modeling, which has allowed credit unions to 
better serve their membership's evolving needs.'' \1\

explores-technological-and-data-barriers-to-more-automated-inclusive-
credit-union-lending/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We need more participants in the system to get behind this effort: 
if alternative data were reported at scale, it would substantially 
increase credit access and financial inclusion for all Americans. 
TransUnion is committed to helping more Americans access credit and 
wealth-building opportunities, which is why we are strong proponents of 
legislation to increase the inclusion of alternative data on credit 
reports. Consumers should get credit for the payments they are making 
that are not traditionally reported to the bureaus--including rent, 
utility or mobile phone payments--to help them build their credit 
profiles.
    We also know the real impact credit reports have on consumers' 
lives. We are committed to ``getting it right every time.'' Since I 
took charge of the company, TransUnion has undergone a transformation 
focused on improving the consumer experience. Our goal is operational 
excellence on behalf of the consumer--and it is critical to our mission 
and work. We understand that we must place the consumer experience at 
the center of what we do.
    TransUnion has been proud to lead the way on pro-consumer changes 
in the industry:

  <bullet>  As the country plunged into the pandemic and ensuing 
        economic crisis, we provided consumers with free weekly credit 
        reports.

  <bullet>  We led the way in encouraging lenders to use our trended 
        and alternative data solutions to provide a more accurate 
        picture of consumer creditworthiness and to bring ``credit 
        invisible'' Americans into the modern economy.

  <bullet>  And we continually invest in our operational infrastructure 
        to build a best-in-class dispute-resolution infrastructure, to 
        ensure our data is as accurate as possible.

  <bullet>  We led the way on issues related to medical debt. Last 
        year, along with the other major credit reporting agencies, we 
        removed all paid medical debt from consumers' credit files. We 
        also no longer include unpaid medical debt totaling $500 or 
        less on credit reports. Together, these changes will remove 
        nearly 70 percent of all medical collections from credit 
        reports.
Protecting Consumers' Data Privacy
    TransUnion is committed to ensuring that consumers' data privacy 
rights are protected and that consumers can manage their own personal 
data and information. We support the passage of a strong Federal 
privacy bill that both provides meaningful rights to consumers and 
preempts State-by-State privacy regulation. The patchwork, State-level 
approach to data privacy in the United States is confusing and 
inefficient for businesses and consumers alike. Enacting a 
comprehensive Federal privacy standard, modeled on the European Union's 
General Data Protection Regulation, would increase U.S. competitiveness 
while providing clarity to all stakeholders. TransUnion recommends 
legislation that allows consumers meaningful choice in how their data 
is collected and used without unilaterally proscribing data collection 
and use. A Federal bill should recognize that the rules around 
collection and use should be tailored to the level of risk and the 
purpose of the data processing activity. A Federal bill should also 
recognize the important role that data plays in our modern economy, 
facilitating the instantaneous and tailored experiences that consumers 
expect. Finally, we believe any Federal privacy law should recognize 
the important role of consumer data in fraud prevention.
    While we are proud of our voluntary efforts to improve the 
experience for consumers who rely on our credit reports, we also 
appreciate the opportunity to partner with policymakers to shine a 
light on our industry and to work towards industry-wide improvements. 
We appreciate the work of this Committee, in particular Chairman Brown 
and Ranking Member Scott, for your leadership in helping to make the 
credit reporting system stronger. We recognize our responsibility to 
our consumers and are committed to improving the system for all 
consumers. We want to continue to build on our successful history, and 
we will continue to work with Congress and our regulators to provide 
consumers with the tools they need to realize economic opportunities.
    Thank you again for the invitation to testify today. I look forward 
to answering your questions.

                 PREPARED STATEMENT OF BRIAN J. CASSIN
                             CEO, Experian
                             April 27, 2023
    Chairman Brown, Ranking Committee Member Scott, and Members of the 
Committee, I am Brian Cassin, CEO of Experian. I appreciate the 
opportunity to discuss the important work Experian does for the benefit 
of consumers, lenders, and the U.S. economy.
    Let me begin by stating why credit bureaus exist, how consumers 
benefit, and how our work provides underlying stability to the entire 
consumer credit ecosystem.
    Credit bureaus accurately compile consumers' payment histories 
reported to us by individual creditors so that all lenders can use this 
data to make sound underwriting decisions. Good lending decisions mean 
fewer defaults. Fewer defaults reduce the cost of credit and increase 
the availability of consumer credit across the economy. Because credit 
bureau data does not include demographic factors such as race, color, 
religion, and gender, it also helps lenders make nonbiased lending 
decisions in compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.
    Experian wholly understands its clear statutory obligations: ensure 
the information we hold on consumers is secure; make credit reports 
accurate; and provide a method to correct data that is easy for 
consumers to access and use.
    Experian supports this Committee's goal of enhancing the accuracy 
of credit reports, improving consumers' experience through the dispute-
resolution process, and making fair and affordable credit available to 
all communities.
    Experian has invested heavily in systems and processes to improve 
data accuracy as we continually strive to reach 100 percent accuracy. 
We work with approximately 10,000 lenders and other data contributors 
across the spectrum of consumer lending, including credit card, auto, 
mortgage, retail, and fintech and we and have stringent requirements 
and monitoring programs in place to ensure that our furnishers are 
submitting accurate information to us.
    An important component of accuracy is a consumer's right to review 
their own credit report and correct errors. With millions of free 
reports and scores in the ecosystem monthly, consumers have easy and 
free access to their credit information, including through 
annualcreditreport.com, which provides free weekly reports to 
consumers. Experian has a free online dispute portal, including a 
mobile-optimized website and app. Consumers can also easily reach us by 
telephone or mail.
    Mr. Chairman, studies suggest that as many as 50 million American 
adults are unable to access fair and affordable credit, either because 
they have a very thin credit file or because they are completely credit 
invisible. We also understand that many consumers, particularly 
minorities and lower-income individuals, are often under-represented in 
the credit reporting system.
    This is an area where Experian is at the forefront with the launch 
of Experian Boost in early 2019. Boost allows consumers for the first 
time to safely and easily opt-in to having proven payment information--
like utility, cell phone, rent, and video streaming services--included 
directly in their credit report, which can improve their credit score.
    In January 2022 we also launched Experian Go, a ground-breaking 
feature that helps consumers who are credit invisible to establish a 
financial identity with Experian so they can begin building a credit 
history.
    Since its launch, more than 12 million consumers have come to 
Experian Boost to improve their credit score, and 130,000 consumers 
have used Experian Go to establish a financial identity. The results 
are notable: we estimate that consumers have been able to access 
billions of dollars in credit post-Boost, including credit cards, car 
loans, and mortgages. Experian is also providing access to free credit 
monitoring, free credit reports, free credit scores, and financial 
education to more than 65 million U.S. consumers.
    I am proud of the work our employees do every day to help and 
empower consumers. We would like to continue to work with this 
Committee to identify other ways we can improve the system for 
consumers.
    Thank you for inviting me to testify. I look forward to answering 
your questions.
         RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF CHAIR BROWN
                       FROM MARK W. BEGOR

Q.1. Congress enacted the Fair Credit Reporting Act to protect 
consumers from harmful and inaccurate reporting errors--errors 
which could result in consumers being declined for mortgages or 
loans for which they should otherwise have qualified. Forced 
arbitration has undermined these critical consumer protections. 
Does your credit reporting agency use forced arbitration to 
resolve consumer disputes over errors?

A.1. No, Equifax does not.

Q.2. Is your company still using outsourced vendors from other 
countries to process your disputes? If so, please explain and 
provide the name of the country and vendor.

A.2. Yes, our vendor service providers are Teleperformance in 
India and Foundever (previously known as Sitel) in the 
Philippines. We also have Equifax employees in the United 
States and Costa Rica that process disputes.

Q.3. In a January 2023 report, the CFPB noted that they had 
received nearly one million complaints about credit reporting 
and other consumer reporting, but only forwarded 565,000. The 
reduction by over 40 percent is the result of the CFPB's 
efforts to monitor and safeguard its complaint process from 
undisclosed third-party submitters. Is it your position that 
the 565,000 complaints that the CFPB forwarded to you after the 
Bureau had screened for undisclosed third-party involvement are 
still the result of illegitimate credit repair?

A.3. It is not Equifax's position that all CFPB portal 
complaints are a result of illegitimate credit repair. Since 
May 2022, Equifax has responded to all CFPB portal complaints 
with the applicable service requested by the consumer, 
including initiating a dispute when appropriate. Regardless of 
how a dispute is initiated (i.e., through the CFPB portal or 
directly), Equifax processes legitimate disputes whether from 
the consumer or from someone authorized to act on their behalf.

Q.4. According to a report from the House Select Subcommittee 
on the Coronavirus Crisis, your company annually receives 
disputes on about 36 to 42 million individual items of 
information in the credit reports you issue. Yet, according to 
the report, company employees only spend an average of 12 to 13 
minutes per dispute. How are your employees able to conduct 
``reasonable investigations'' as required by the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act when they spend only 12 to 13 minutes 
investigating each dispute?

A.4. Equifax has invested significant resources to improve the 
consumer's experience when interacting with us, including 
enhancing online dispute capabilities and automating processes 
where practical. These investments are intended to reduce 
friction for the consumer and lead to better consumer 
experiences and outcomes. Because of these system improvements, 
it is not possible to correlate agent time spent per case to 
the quality or completeness of the resolution of the disputes 
or complaints.
    As noted in Equifax's response to the House Select 
Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Equifax does not track 
the amount of time spent on all individual dispute cases 
because not every dispute requires agent intervention. 
Therefore, it is not possible to calculate the exact median or 
mean for the time spent on each case. Equifax made a good faith 
effort to provide the Select Subcommittee certain data related 
to the length of time agents spend assisting consumers with 
their phone disputes and the processing time for CFPB portal 
complaints.

Q.5. Equifax's website currently includes a product sheet 
detailing Equifax's Resident Screening Services, which the 
website states include credit reports, InstaCriminal National 
or Statewide search, national sex offender search, eviction 
search, employment verification, and rental history. Does 
Equifax currently offer landlords resident screening services 
that include these data elements on consumers?

A.5. Equifax provides tenant services that can include these 
data elements to qualified property managers who own one to 
many multi-unit properties. Equifax's tenant screening business 
is predominantly driven through resellers to whom we provide 
credit report information from one or more nationwide consumer 
reporting agencies, credit scores from VantageScore 
<SUP>'</SUP> or FICO <SUP>'</SUP>, income and employment 
information from The Work Number <SUP>'</SUP>, or Equifax 
digital identity and fraud authentication products. Consumer 
report information is provided for Fair Credit Reporting Act 
(FCRA) purposes to entities that undergo Equifax's 
credentialing process.
                                ------                                


         RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR REED
                       FROM MARK W. BEGOR

Q.1. Please explain your company's current approach to 
incorporating Buy Now, Pay Later (or BNPL) lending into a 
consumer's credit file and describe the specific technological 
or commercial impediments to making sure BNPL repayment history 
is reported and scored in a standardized fashion.

A.1. Equifax was the first to formalize inclusion of popular 
Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) ``pay-in-four'' loan payment 
information in U.S. consumer credit reports with an industry 
code that was made available to data furnishers in February 
2022. We worked to formalize the inclusion of BNPL payment data 
on consumer credit reports with the belief that consumers 
should get credit for paying bills on time and should be able 
to use their responsible BNPL behaviors as a stepping stone to 
other types of credit, like auto loans or mortgages.
    Equifax is making data-driven decisions on how BNPL payment 
information is incorporated into consumer credit reports. We 
are working closely with FICO and BNPL providers to determine 
how different processes--paired with several factors, including 
a consumer's starting credit score, payment history, 
utilization and more--affect each individual. Based on our most 
recent analysis of anonymized consumer data from a BNPL 
provider reporting tradelines as revolving lines of credit, we 
found that individuals who pay their BNPL loans on time could 
potentially increase their Equifax Risk Score (ERS) and FICO 
<SUP>'</SUP> Score. Typically, consumers can leverage BNPL 
products early on in their credit lifecycle, even if they may 
not qualify for other traditional types of credit. For 
consumers beginning to build their credit--or those looking to 
rebuild their credit--using BNPL products from companies 
reporting presents an opportunity to demonstrate responsible 
behavior and build or rebuild credit.
    However, while Equifax encourages BNPL providers to report 
payment data, pay-in-four loans are not being broadly reported 
by providers to Equifax today. Larger dollar and longer term 
BNPL loans are reported today and appear on consumer credit 
reports as revolving or installment lines of credit.

Q.2. We have recently heard credible reports of consumers 
receiving dozens or hundreds of unexpected and unwanted phone 
calls and texts, within hours of applying for a mortgage, from 
other lenders offering purportedly better financing. Do you 
make money from selling these so-called ``trigger leads,'' 
which are used to target and spam unsuspecting customers? Do 
you believe dozens or hundreds of these solicitations are a 
nuisance for consumers? Do you have the ability to prevent the 
information that you provide to lenders from being used to 
overwhelm consumers with ads and solicitations? If so, why are 
reports of spam solicitations increasing?

A.2. The products in question comply with applicable laws and 
are offered under the prescreening requirements of the FCRA. 
Equifax contractually restricts the use of these leads to one 
call and one follow-up per lender to each consumer. A decline 
in mortgage originations combined with an uncertain economic 
environment may be increasing marketing activity for mortgage 
professionals. Equifax does not support the misuse of mortgage 
leads in a manner that results in spamming and harassing 
consumers. There are benefits to mortgage leads within the 
industry that provide competition amongst lenders and can 
result in lower costs for consumers. Mortgage leads can help 
consumers shopping for mortgage loans, by making consumers 
aware of lower rates or better deals.

Q.3. What additional steps are your company taking to combat 
the recent increase in fraud targeted at service members and 
veterans?

A.3. Equifax appreciates the sacrifices our service members and 
veterans have made for our country. For military members on 
active duty or members of the National Guard, Equifax offers 
free credit monitoring services, called Credit 
Watch<SUP>TM</SUP> Gold. Credit Watch<SUP>TM</SUP> Gold 
includes notifications of changes to the Equifax credit report, 
daily access to the Equifax credit report, automatic renewal of 
an initial fraud alert, and up to $25,000 of insurance coverage 
to help with certain out-of-pocket expenses for victims of 
identity theft. Active-duty military members or members of the 
National Guard may be asked to recertify eligibility every 2 
years. Members of the military on active duty may request an 
active-duty alert on their credit files to minimize the risk of 
fraud. The active-duty alert lasts for 1 year and the 
consumer's name is removed from the prescreen list for offers 
of credit or insurance for 2 years.
    Equifax does not have information about a consumer's 
veteran status, but service members and veterans may also 
leverage other services to prevent identity theft or other 
fraud, and to protect their information. These services 
include:

  <bullet>  A fraud alert is a notice that is placed on a 
        consumer's credit report that alerts credit card 
        companies and others who may extend credit that the 
        consumer may have been a victim of fraud, including 
        identity theft. Once a fraud alert is placed with one-
        of-three nationwide credit reporting agencies, that 
        bureau will send the fraud alert request to the other 
        two. An initial fraud alert lasts for 1 year, and may 
        be renewed.

  <bullet>  An extended fraud alert can be placed if a consumer 
        is a victim of fraud or identity theft. The extended 
        fraud alert has the same protections as a fraud alert, 
        but lasts for 7 years. If a consumer has an extended 
        fraud alert, the consumer's name is removed from the 
        prescreen list for offers of credit or insurance, for 5 
        years.

  <bullet>  A security freeze to prevent unauthorized access to 
        the consumer's credit file.

  <bullet>  A credit lock using a mobile app allows consumers 
        to lock and unlock their credit reports using identity 
        verification techniques. A credit lock generally 
        prevents access to a credit report to open new credit 
        accounts.

  <bullet>  If a consumer believes information in their credit 
        file is a result of identity theft, the consumer can 
        request that a consumer reporting agency block that 
        information.

    Additionally, veterans who have a medical debt on their 
credit report that is being paid by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs can submit documentation to have the medical debt 
removed from the credit file of the veteran.
    Finally, Equifax has expressed support for the 
Servicemembers' Credit Monitoring Enhancement Act to provide 
additional credit monitoring services for certain family 
members of a member of the military.
                                ------                                


               RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF
            SENATOR CORTEZ MASTO FROM MARK W. BEGOR

Q.1. Can you explain why consumer complaints about credit 
reporting agencies at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
complaint portal have skyrocketed over the past 2 years? Now, 
about three of four consumer complaints are about credit scores 
and credit reports.

A.1. The credit reporting industry is committed to helping 
consumers resolve discrepancies on their credit reports and we 
are working diligently across the financial ecosystem to make 
sure data on consumer credit reports is accurate and 
comprehensive. Since April 2020, the nationwide consumer 
reporting agencies have offered free weekly credit reports to 
consumers through the end of 2023. One potential rationale for 
increased activity in the CFPB complaint portal is that 
consumers have become more proactive in monitoring their credit 
reports so that they are more aware of what lenders may see and 
so that they can detect any inaccurate or incomplete 
information provided to the credit bureaus. Economic factors, 
such as rising interest rates and economic uncertainty, may 
also play a role in consumers submitting complaints through the 
CFPB portal. It is worth noting that the nationwide consumer
reporting agencies are in a unique position as compared to 
other financial services providers. Equifax compiles 
information on over 250 million U.S. consumers. The amount of 
information and number of consumers served by the credit 
reporting system is one reasonable explanation for the volume 
of complaints mentioning credit reporting. Not only is the 
number of consumers served by the nationwide consumer reporting 
agencies vastly greater than virtually all other financial 
services providers, but consumer reporting agencies also serve 
as the intermediary between consumers and their lending 
institutions. Additionally, the CFPB complaint portal combines 
consumer complaints with disputes about information on credit 
files. Many of the complaints in the CFPB complaint portal 
appear to be disputes about data reported to Equifax by data 
furnishers and not complaints about an Equifax product or 
service.

Q.2. How is your firm thinking about using the new Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) technologies? Does your firm use--or are you 
considering using AI to communicate with consumers, in the 
dispute process and/or in value-added services such as credit 
scores?

A.2. As one of the first patent holders for Explainable 
Artificial Intelligence (xAI) in credit-risk modeling, Equifax 
has a deep legacy advancing data, analytics and technology to 
ensure transparency in the use of AI. xAI is our modern 
approach to predictive analytics and is embodied in our patent 
portfolio centered around specific machine learning models that 
generate logical and actionable reason codes to the consumer, 
increasing transparency in the process. At Equifax, the primary 
function of an explanation is to facilitate continued model 
learning while ensuring Equifax models are logical, actionable, 
and explainable. Equifax is committed to ongoing education and 
research in the field of AI and recently announced the launch 
of an AI Ethics Lab with Kennesaw State University to study the 
use of AI in the U.S. financial services industry. The research 
will establish methods to help identify how an AI-powered 
process may create different outcomes than traditional models 
and the potential impact of these differences.
    AI is currently used in the Equifax dispute process to: (1) 
sort and route disputes received by mail to specialty queues to 
ensure appropriate handling; (2) send and receive referrals to 
and from other nationwide consumer reporting agencies; and (3) 
process CDV (consumer dispute verification) responses from the 
data furnishers. Equifax also leverages Natural Language 
Processing in our Interactive Voice Response system to guide 
consumers to self-service options and to route them to the most 
appropriate agent group for handling.

Q.3. Does your firm sell consumer information to vendors? If 
so, how can people avoid having their information sold?

A.3. Equifax provides consumer information to its customers. 
Equifax maintains a credentialing process for all of its 
customers. To receive Equifax data, a customer must sign a 
contract with Equifax and meet credentialing requirements based 
on the type of data requested. Credentialing includes 
verification that the prospective customer is a legitimate 
business, screening against sanctions lists, public information 
searches, and may include additional verifications such as 
background checks or onsite inspections depending on the type 
of data to be provided.
    Equifax is committed to responsibly and appropriately using 
consumer data. Equifax understands people want more control 
over how their personal data is collected, used, shared, and 
protected. Equifax is subject to numerous laws and regulations 
governing the collection, protection and use of consumer credit 
and other information, and imposing sanctions for the misuse of 
such information or unauthorized access to data. Many of these 
provisions also affect our customers' use of consumer credit or 
other data we furnish. Examples of the most significant U.S. 
laws include, but are not limited to, the Fair Credit Reporting 
Act, Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act, and the Credit Repair Organizations Act.
    Under section 604(e)(6) of the FCRA consumers have the 
right to opt-out of receiving firm offers of credit or 
insurance. At www.optoutprescreen.com consumers have the choice 
to opt-out from receiving firm offers for 5 years or 
permanently. Under FCRA sections 605A(i) and 605A(j), consumers 
also have the option to place a security freeze to prevent 
access to their consumer report.
    In addition to the right to opt-out from receiving firm 
offers of credit, Equifax allows residents of any U.S. State to 
submit requests to limit the use and disclosure of their 
sensitive personal information and opt-out of the sharing and 
selling of their personal information, in accordance with 
applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws. Equifax maintains an online 
Privacy Preference Center (https://www.equifax.com/personal/my-
privacy/) where consu-
mers can exercise control over their data.

Q.4. If a potential home buyer seeks a mortgage, are there any 
limits to how many vendors can purchase their information and 
how often--and through what means--they can contact the 
potential borrower?

A.4. Equifax contractually restricts the use of these leads to 
one call and one follow-up per lender to each consumer. The 
products in question comply with applicable laws and are 
offered under the prescreening requirements of the FCRA. A 
decline in mortgage originations combined with an uncertain 
economic environment may be increasing marketing activity for 
mortgage professionals.

Q.5. How does your firm address concerns and complaints from 
consumers who received unwanted solicitations or are upset with 
the lender who they think sold their information to a 
competitor?

A.5. Under section 604(e)(6) of the FCRA consumers have the 
right to opt-out of receiving firm offers of credit or 
insurance. At www.optoutprescreen.com consumers have the choice 
to opt-out from receiving firm offers for 5 years or 
permanently.
    In addition to the right to opt-out from receiving firm 
offers of credit, Equifax allows residents of any U.S. State to 
submit requests to limit the use and disclosure of their 
sensitive personal information and opt-out of the sharing and 
selling of their personal information, in accordance with 
applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws. Equifax maintains an online 
Privacy Preference Center where consumers can exercise control 
over their data.

Q.6. How does your company ensure consumer data is only shared 
or sold to legitimate and trustworthy third-party companies? 
How does your firm evaluate these third-party companies?

A.6. Equifax maintains a credentialing process for all of its 
customers. To receive Equifax data, a customer must sign a 
contract with Equifax and meet credentialing requirements based 
on the type of data requested. Credentialing includes 
verification that the prospective customer is a legitimate 
business, screening against sanctions lists, public information 
searches, and may include additional verifications such as 
background checks or onsite inspections depending on the type 
of data to be provided.

Q.7. Does your firm sell consumer credit information to 
companies located outside of the United States? If so, for what 
purposes?

A.7. Equifax provides consumer reports only when there is a 
FCRA permissible purpose. All customers, regardless of whether 
they are requesting a consumer report or another type of 
consumer information must meet our credentialing requirements 
and sign agreements that limit the use of the information they 
receive from Equifax. Some of our customers have locations 
outside of the United States, but we primarily do business with 
U.S.-based companies.

Q.8. If multiple consumers complain to your bureau about 
outreach they are getting from an individual company--does your 
company re-evaluate your arrangement with that company?

A.8. In general, Equifax does not receive complaints from 
consumers about outreach they are getting from another company.

Q.9. Have you ever declined to sell data to a company as a 
result of consumer complaints? If so, please explain.

A.9. In general, Equifax does not receive complaints from 
consumers about how other companies use information obtained 
from Equifax.

Q.10. What measures do you take to ensure the privacy and 
security of consumer personal and financial information?

A.10. Equifax has invested significant time and resources into 
ensuring that consumers' information is protected. Multiple 
independent ratings show that our security capabilities exceed 
every major industry average. We maintain a comprehensive 
security control framework, which includes multiple layers of 
controls designed to ensure the privacy and security of 
consumer personal and financial information. In May of 2023, we 
made our security and privacy controls framework public for the 
benefit of security and privacy teams at organizations of all 
sizes. By enabling the larger technology ecosystem with the 
tools to design, build, and maintain secure processes, Equifax 
is helping empower companies to set a cybersecurity and privacy 
posture that is more adaptable to evolving threats.
    Equifax also complies with relevant security and privacy-
related laws, regulations, and industry standards (e.g., PCI 
DSS), and maintains processes that allow consumers to exercise 
their rights under State privacy laws (e.g., CCPA).

Q.11. Are any demographic data points such as race, national 
origin or gender included in the data being sold?

A.11. Consumer credit reports do not contain race, gender, 
marital status, national origin or other kinds of demographic 
information.

Q.12. Can consumers select which data points about them that 
can be sold?

A.12. Under section 604(e)(6) of the FCRA, consumers have the 
right to opt-out of receiving firm offers of credit or 
insurance. At www.optoutprescreen.com, consumers have the 
choice to opt-out from receiving firm offers for 5 years or 
permanently.
    In addition to the right to opt-out from receiving firm 
offers of credit, Equifax allows residents of any U.S. State to 
submit requests to limit the use and disclosure of their 
sensitive personal information and opt-out of the sharing and 
selling of their personal information, in accordance with 
applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws. Equifax maintains an online 
Privacy Preference Center (https://www.equifax.com/personal/my-
privacy/) where consu-
mers can exercise control over their data.

Q.13. Does your research find that people who live in States 
which have not expanded their Medicaid program have lower 
credit scores due to greater prevalence of medical debt?

A.13. Equifax has not conducted research analyzing the 
interaction of expanded Medicaid programs and the impact of 
medical debt on credit scores.

Q.14. As your firm restricts some medical debt from being 
reported, what impact do you think this will have on credit 
scores for States that have not expanded Medicaid?
    Will they most likely still have lower credit scores than 
those States which did expand Medicaid?

A.14. Equifax has not conducted research analyzing the 
interaction of expanded Medicaid programs and the impact of 
medical debt on credit scores.

Q.15. When someone changes their name, is it possible for 
someone to prevent their original name from appearing in their 
credit report to the person or firm which requested the credit 
report? This would be the bank, employer, property manager, 
etc.?

A.15. Equifax recommends that consumers who legally change 
names directly inform Equifax and other nationwide consumer 
reporting agencies (NCRAs) of this action once it is complete. 
Doing this provides the critical link needed between the 
person's chosen name and their original name, which will help 
to maintain the integrity of their credit file and potentially 
avoid any misunderstanding with creditors or lenders. While we 
do not currently suppress original names, we are working to 
address the concerns of transgender and nonbinary individuals 
while maintaining the accuracy of consumer data, as required by 
law.

Q.16. How can transgender people benefit from having their 
credit history remain after a name change without losing their 
privacy?

A.16. We share transgender and nonbinary individuals' desire to 
have their credit history attached to their new name. Equifax 
recommends that consumers who legally change names directly 
inform Equifax and other NCRAs of this action once it is 
complete. This will provide critical information in order to 
link the credit files containing the chosen name and the former 
name. This will assist in maintaining accuracy and integrity of 
credit files during transitions and help to avoid 
misunderstandings with creditors or lenders. Equifax uses a 
proprietary keying and linking system to match consumers with 
the appropriate file and we are committed to continuously 
improving this system to address the concerns of transgender 
and nonbinary individuals.

Q.17. Some have recommended removing all delinquencies from 
credit files after 4 years, instead of 7. How would limiting 
the time that delinquencies could be listed affect credit 
reports and scores?

A.17. Equifax has not conducted an analytic study on the impact 
of reducing the statutory time limit from 7 to 4 years on 
credit reports and scores.

Q.18. A recent research paper from the Federal Reserve of 
Minneapolis found unexplained disparities in denial rates for 
solo applicants compared to dual applicants. In its sample of 
mortgage applications from the confidential Home Mortgage 
Disclosure Act (HMDA) dataset,* 56.1 percent feature a solo 
applicant. Lenders denied 3.7 percent of applications in the 
sample overall; the denial rate for solo applicants is 4.3 
percent compared to 3.0 percent for dual applicants. Adjusting 
for differences in characteristics of solo applicants, the 
denial rate for solo applicants is 4.1 percent
compared to 3.0 percent for dual applicants. The report noted 
that White applicants are the least likely to apply for a 
mortgage alone.
    Applications submitted by at least one White applicant are 
over 50 percent more likely to have a co-applicant than 
applications submitted by at least one Black applicant: 31 
percent of applications submitted by at least one Black 
applicant have a co-applicant, compared to 48 percent of 
applications submitted by at least one White applicant. In 
addition, single women over 62 tend to have higher mortgage 
rates.
    What insights does your firm have in the credit reports, 
credit scores and mortgage acceptance, and rates offered to 
single borrowers, especially borrowers of color and elderly 
women, compared to White and duo borrowers?

A.18. In 2022, out of 6.68M mortgage originations, about 55.70 
percent included single applicants. Credit reports do not 
contain race, gender, marital status, or other kinds of 
demographic information. In addition, Equifax does not receive 
notification when a mortgage is closed; therefore, Equifax does 
not have additional information to share on acceptance and 
rates offered to specific borrowers.
                                ------                                


         RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF CHAIR BROWN
                    FROM CHRIS A. CARTWRIGHT

Q.1. Congress enacted the Fair Credit Reporting Act to protect 
consumers from harmful and inaccurate reporting errors--errors 
which could result in consumers being declined for mortgages or 
loans for which they should otherwise have qualified. Forced 
arbitration has undermined these critical consumer protections. 
Does your credit reporting agency use forced arbitration to 
resolve consumer disputes over errors?

A.1. No, TransUnion does not use forced arbitration to resolve 
consumer disputes over errors.

Q.2. In a January 2023 report, the CFPB noted that they had 
received nearly one million complaints about credit reporting 
and other consumer reporting, but only forwarded 565,000. The 
reduction by over 40 percent is the result of the CFPB's 
efforts to monitor and safeguard its complaint process from 
undisclosed third-party submitters. Is it your position that 
the 565,000 complaints that the CFPB forwarded to you after the 
Bureau had screened for undisclosed third-party involvement are 
still the result of illegitimate credit repair?

A.2. We appreciate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's 
(CFPB) recent regulatory and enforcement efforts concerning 
third-party credit repair agencies and the significant 
challenges they pose due to their practices. \1\ Third-party 
credit repair agencies continue to present challenges to the 
CRAs, with a persistently large number of complaints and 
disputes clogging the system.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \1\ See, e.g., Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, ``CFPB To

Q.3. TransUnion touts its online dispute process as a helpful 
tool for consumers. According to TU's website, consumers can 
``manage or fix any inaccuracies,'' on their credit reports 
through the system. In 2021, TU acquired Neustar, a data broker 
that handles people's sensitive identifiable information. 
Should Americans have the same ability to manage or fix 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
inaccuracies for Neustar data? Please explain.

A.3. TransUnion operates multiple consumer reporting businesses 
that are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which 
regulates the way CRAs can collect, access, use, and share 
consumer information. In addition, TransUnion offers products 
that are not subject to the FCRA, but instead are governed by a 
variety of other State and Federal laws including the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act and a multiplicity of privacy laws. A major 
component of our non-FCRA solutions are our fraud prevention 
products, including the tools formerly known as Neustar Fraud 
Solutions.
    We take our compliance obligations seriously and employ a 
comprehensive FCRA compliance program that governs our FCRA 
offerings. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau supervises our activities and provides regular feedback.
    Data accuracy is critical in both our FCRA and non-FCRA 
products. Most State privacy laws afford consumers broad rights 
to access, understand, and correct information. TransUnion 
supports the ability of consumers to fix incorrect data 
provided by data furnishers, and we are committed to ensuring 
high levels of data accuracy. This includes an extensive data 
management and due-diligence process that begins when potential 
data sources are initially considered.

Q.4. According to a report from the House Select Subcommittee 
on the Coronavirus Crisis, each year your company received 
disputes on about 36 to 38 million individual items of 
information in the credit reports you issued. Yet, according to 
the report, your company has only 171 staff handling disputes. 
How is your company able to conduct ``reasonable 
investigations'' as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act 
with only 171 employees investigating tens of millions of 
disputes?
    Are any of these employees contracted from outsourced 
vendors? If so, please explain and provide the name of the 
country and vendor.

A.4. TransUnion is committed to data accuracy across all of our 
businesses. Our turnaround time in addressing consumer disputes 
is now approximately 9 days, well below the 30-day requirement 
of the FCRA. When a consumer believes a data furnisher 
inaccurately reports information, we facilitate the FCRA-
mandated investigatory process and, if data is incorrect, we 
provide a system-wide update to the furnisher and other CRAs. 
We regularly measure furnisher performance and provide insights 
regarding furnisher data quality to the CFPB.
    During the COVID-19 pandemic, TransUnion engaged in 
extraordinary efforts to help consumers and we believe we were 
appropriately staffed to manage the challenges we encountered. 
This included keeping our call centers open, despite logistical 
challenges, and consistently monitoring staffing levels to meet 
regulatory standards in responding to consumer disputes. We 
have increased our staffing levels since the pandemic and our 
call center wait times have returned to their pre-pandemic 
levels. In addition, we led the industry initiative to provide 
free weekly access to consumer credit reports throughout the 
pandemic. This initiative was a natural outgrowth of our 
practice of broadly offering many consumer tools available for 
free, including real time credit monitoring and various 
analytical and simulation features that help consumers 
understand interactions with scoring companies and lenders. 
TransUnion also established a dedicated consumer support COVID-
19 resources webpage that provides all Americans easy and free 
access to credit support tools, guidance on how to navigate the 
pandemic, and one-click access to freeze their credit files or 
dispute any information on their report.
    We use an India-based vendor named Teleperformance to 
support some of our consumer service operations.

Q.5. In your testimony, you stated that consumers are able to 
see the information that is reported against them on a tenant 
screening report today, and that they are able to dispute that 
information under the FCRA.
    Are tenants able to see all information included as part of 
a tenant screening or background report before or at the same 
time as a landlord accesses that information as part of making 
a determination on a tenant's rental application? If so, please 
describe the process that a tenant would use to access this 
information from TransUnion. If a tenant cannot see the 
information before or at the same time as a landlord accesses 
the report, how can a consumer request a copy of their report?

A.5. TransUnion Rental Screening Solutions, Inc. (TURSS) offers 
multiple rental screening solutions tailored to the parties to 
a rental agreement. TURSS's rental screening services promote 
equitable housing opportunities by helping property owners find 
qualified tenants, reduce fraud, and protect the safety of 
tenants and property. One of our primary solution offerings 
allows tenants to see their information at the same time as 
landlords. The ultimate availability of this offering depends 
on adoption by customers and third-party platform providers. 
Further, tenants can always access the information in their 
report at any time through additional means, including 
requesting a consumer disclosure under the FCRA or requesting a 
copy from the landlord.
    TURSS is committed to providing accurate rental screening 
data, and TURSS is working with the CFPB and Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) to make pro-consumer changes to modernize the 
tenant screening sector, including refraining from reporting 
eviction cases before there is a final outcome. The CFPB 
exercises supervisory authority over TURSS's screening 
solutions and TURSS regularly engages with them to align our 
practices with their expectations. We are eager to engage with 
the Senate Banking Committee to explore further improvements to 
screening practices that could create consistency in the 
market.

Q.6. How many individual tenants requested a copy of their 
tenant screening report from TransUnion in 2022? How many 
landlords purchased tenant screening reports from TransUnion in 
2022? Waiting on final number.

A.6. In 2022, TURSS had approximately 4,565 consumer disclosure 
requests in which we concluded are individual tenants 
requesting a copy of their report. In 2022, approximately 
746,744 landlords used SmartMove and ShareAble for Rentals to 
purchase tenant screening reports.

Q.7. Under TransUnion's current terms for a landlord to access 
a tenant screening report for a consumer, is the landlord 
permitted to share a copy of that report with the consumer? If 
not, why not?

A.7. Yes--the landlord is permitted to share a copy of the 
report with the consumer.
                                ------                                


         RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR REED
                    FROM CHRIS A. CARTWRIGHT

Q.1. Please explain your company's current approach to 
incorporating Buy Now, Pay Later (or BNPL) lending into a 
consumer's credit file and describe the specific technological 
or commercial impediments to making sure BNPL repayment history 
is reported and scored in a standardized fashion.

A.1. TransUnion is exploring ways to accept Buy Now, Pay Later 
(BNPL) information as part of a consumer's credit report. We 
are having regular discussions with the CFPB and other 
stakeholders on the operational issues associated with BNPL 
data. As traditional scores cannot yet take into account this 
new form of purchase financing, underwriting models will need 
plenty of time to adjust to a new product type (the industry 
hasn't seen a new product type in recent history).
    BNPL and other select point-of-sale tradelines and 
attributes will be reported to a partitioned section of the 
TransUnion core credit file built specifically for this 
purpose--where they will be excluded from delivery to existing 
scoring models and decisioning criteria until models have a 
chance to adjust. Default delivery of the core credit file will 
not include any BNPL and point-of-sale data, and current FICO 
Scores and VantageScore models will see no impact until these 
scoring providers choose to incorporate these data after 
additional analysis.

Q.2. We have recently heard credible reports of consumers 
receiving dozens or hundreds of unexpected and unwanted phone 
calls and texts, within hours of applying for a mortgage, from 
other lenders offering purportedly better financing. Do you 
make money from selling these so-called ``trigger leads,'' 
which are used to target and spam unsuspecting customers? Do 
you believe dozens or hundreds of these solicitations are a 
nuisance for consumers? Do you have the ability to prevent the 
information that you provide to lenders from being used to 
overwhelm consumers with ads and solicitations? If so, why are 
reports of spam solicitations increasing?

A.2. Only credentialed lenders under contract with TransUnion 
or a TransUnion re-seller may access TransUnion's mortgage 
inquiry prescreen service. Each lender must provide acceptable 
selection criteria, certify a permissible purpose under the 
FCRA, and agree to provide a firm offer of credit as defined by 
the FCRA to each consumer meeting the selection criteria. 
Consumers who have opted out of prescreen lists are excluded 
entirely, and consumers on the do-not-call list have their 
phone numbers excluded from the returned information.

Q.3. What additional steps are your company taking to combat 
the recent increase in fraud targeted at service members and 
veterans?

A.3. Congress has long recognized that free credit reporting 
for active-duty military can help keep service members informed 
about their financial health and offer some peace of mind while 
they focus on their mission. That is why TransUnion is a strong 
public supporter of the Servicemembers' Credit Monitoring 
Enhancement Act, bipartisan legislation to provide free credit 
monitoring for all service members and their families. 
Currently, this free monitoring is only available to active-
duty service members and members of the National Guard.
                                ------                                


               RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF
         SENATOR CORTEZ MASTO FROM CHRIS A. CARTWRIGHT

Q.1. Can you explain why consumer complaints about credit 
reporting agencies at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
complaint portal have skyrocketed over the past 2 years?

A.1. TransUnion strives for the highest possible levels of data 
accuracy--no one wins when a consumer's information is 
incorrect. We are constantly working with lenders, other data 
furnishers, and the CFPB on consumer complaints and dispute 
management. We
believe that recent volumes of complaints via the Bureau's 
portal are attributable to multiple factors.
    At the beginning of the pandemic, the three national 
Consumer Reporting Agencies (CRAs) increased the accessibility 
of credit reports through free weekly disclosures of consumers' 
files to help Americans understand and manage their financial 
health. More than 166 million people in the United States have 
taken advantage of free access to their credit information 
through TransUnion and our partners. Greater access to consumer 
reports increases consumer attention to information that data 
furnishers report. A significant percentage of consumer 
``complaints'' received by the CRAs actually pertain to issues 
between consumers and data furnishers where consumers are 
seeking to ``dispute'' information on their reports as required 
under the FCRA--they are rarely complaints regarding a practice 
or product offered by TransUnion.
    Moreover, as seen in recent CFPB enforcement actions, 
credit repair companies have significantly increased their 
pernicious activity over the past few years. TransUnion 
analyses indicate that the majority of complaints received 
through the CFPB portal come from third-party credit repair 
companies promising consumers that information can be deleted 
from their credit files through the submission of mass disputes 
of derogatory tradelines.
    We have taken a number of proactive steps around consumer 
complaints, and the most recent 2023 CFPB report highlights 
several positive developments for TransUnion. \1\ In January, 
the CFPB acknowledged that we made significant operational 
changes with respect to the handling of consumer complaints in 
2022 vs. 2021. The Bureau also favorably highlighted TransUnion 
spending more time working on complaints. The CFPB also 
acknowledged that TransUnion demonstrated a strong commitment 
to providing relief to consumers when appropriate. We take 
consumer complaints very seriously and work directly with 
consumers and furnishers to resolve disputes. We know how 
distressing any concerns about a credit report can be for a 
consumer. We are continually working to improve our process for 
addressing and resolving disputes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \1\ See Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, ``Annual report of 
credit and consumer reporting complaints'' (January 2023) at https://
files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_fcra-611-e_report_2023-
01.pdf.

Q.2. How is your firm thinking about using the new Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) technologies? Does your firm use--or are you 
considering using AI to communicate with consumers, in the 
dispute process and/or in value-added services such as credit 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
scores?

A.2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automated tools are 
gaining popularity given recent advancements and press around 
models such at ChatGPT and other AI tools or platforms. While 
AI at scale can bolster a company's effectiveness, it can also 
pose risks if not implemented appropriately. TransUnion is 
committed to innovation and staying at the forefront of 
technology advancements. As always, we will do so by stewarding 
the data we hold with the utmost care and responsibility.
    TransUnion has a variety of ways that a consumer can file a 
dispute with us. If a consumer calls TransUnion to initiate the 
dispute process, there is no AI in that channel and they can 
easily speak to an agent. We do use automation to route calls 
and ask the
nature of the call, but we don't limit consumers from speaking 
to agents.

Q.3. Does your firm sell consumer information to vendors? If 
so, how can people avoid having their information sold?

A.3. As a global information and insights company, TransUnion 
recognizes the central role that data plays in the various 
markets in which we operate, and we take seriously the 
accompanying responsibilities to steward consumer information. 
As a CRA, TransUnion's principal business is providing consumer 
financial data to financial institutions under the parameters 
of the FCRA. The FCRA requires financial institutions and other 
businesses to have a ``permissible purpose'' to obtain this 
information. \2\ TransUnion maintains appropriate policies and 
procedures to help ensure consumer report information is only 
shared in a manner consistent with FCRA. These policies and 
procedures include, but are not limited to, certification to 
TransUnion that any entity obtaining a consumer report list the 
permissible purpose(s) for which the report is being obtained

    Beyond the FCRA, our operations are conducted in accordance 
with a variety of State and Federal privacy standards that 
afford consumers broad control over their information. 
TransUnion facilitates much of our U.S. privacy compliance 
through our consumer portal, which provides Americans with 
broad capabilities to opt-out of the sale and certain uses of 
data. For consumers residing in States with laws providing 
residents with additional privacy rights, the portal also 
supports consumer requests to delete, correct, and view covered 
personal information maintained by TransUnion. There is also a 
standalone opt-out page, linked directly from the TransUnion 
homepage. If easier, consumers can also exercise their privacy 
rights by calling our customer call center.

Q.4. If a potential home buyer seeks a mortgage, are there any 
limits to how many vendors can purchase their information and 
how often--and through what means--they can contact the 
potential borrower?

A.4. Only credentialed lenders under contract with TransUnion 
or a TransUnion re-seller may access TransUnion's mortgage 
inquiry prescreen service. Each lender must provide acceptable 
selection criteria, certify a permissible purpose under the 
FCRA, and agree to provide a firm offer of credit as defined by 
the FCRA to each consumer meeting the selection criteria. 
Consumers who have opted out of prescreen lists are excluded 
entirely, and consumers on the do-not-call list have their 
phone numbers excluded from the returned information.

Q.5. How does your firm address concerns and complaints from 
consumers who received unwanted solicitations or are upset with 
the lender who they think sold their information to a 
competitor?

A.5. TransUnion takes consumer experiences, including 
experiences caused by our customers, very seriously. 
TransUnion's role in the consumer credit ecosystem is to 
provide risk analytics and
consumer information to lenders to help with underwriting 
processes. TransUnion has a credentialing process that outlines 
processes for vetting customers, and ensuring that they are 
accessing data in our products according to rules and 
restrictions we have set out. Under TransUnion's Credentialing 
and Onboarding Policy, the Credentialing and Onboarding Team is 
responsible for determining if the business has a purpose 
permitted by applicable laws, rules, regulations, standards and 
TransUnion business practices to use TransUnion's products and 
services.
    Additionally, TransUnion re-performs onboarding procedures 
for existing customers in certain circumstances, including a 
change in ownership of legal structure of the business, a 
change in the nature or purpose of the business, a notice of 
regulatory action against the entity that warrants review, or 
the identification of concerns regarding data reported, use of 
services, or consumer complaints. Such procedures are also re-
performed based on the time elapsed since they were last 
reviewed. If we determine that a customer violated an agreement 
or misused data, we take corrective action, including 
termination of the relationship. TransUnion has stringent 
customer auditing processes and procedures, information 
security requirements, legal standards, and other controls in 
place to ensure that anyone accessing consumers' personal data 
through TransUnion has a legal basis to do so. TransUnion has 
various policies and contract language depending on the data 
and relationship.
    TransUnion monitors consumer complaints and disputes as 
part of an extensive Data Furnisher Monitoring Program. If 
issues are found related to a data furnisher following its FCRA 
obligations (including data accuracy and handling of consumer 
disputes), TransUnion will take corrective action related to 
that furnisher, up to and including termination, as necessary. 
TransUnion has terminated customer relationships as a result of 
our data furnisher monitoring activities and our data furnisher 
monitoring activities include monitoring consumer disputes/
complaints related to individual furnishers and taking action 
up to an including termination.

Q.6. How does your company ensure consumer data is only shared 
or sold to legitimate and trustworthy third-party companies? 
How does your firm evaluate these third-party companies?

A.6. Please see our answers throughout concerning the 
permissible purpose requirements of the FCRA and our preceding 
response to Question 5 regarding our credentialing processes. 
Further, TransUnion regularly shares data with the CFPB on the 
volume and types of submissions received through the dispute 
and complaints process.

Q.7. Does your firm sell consumer credit information to 
companies located outside of the United States? If so, for what 
purposes?

A.7. We do not sell any information about U.S. consumers 
outside of the United States. As a global information and 
insights company, we have a presence in more than 30 countries 
and territories, including the United States, Canada, Latin 
America, the United Kingdom, Africa, Asia Pacific, and India.
    TransUnion has put in place procedures, through our 
credentialing and procurement processes, to ensure that we are 
not doing business with individuals on the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked 
Persons list. TransUnion does not store U.S. consumer data in 
China, Russia, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, or Iran.

Q.8. If multiple consumers complain to your bureau about 
outreach they are getting from an individual company--does your 
company re-evaluate your arrangement with that company?

A.8. Please see answer to Question 5.

Q.9. Have you ever declined to sell data to a company as a 
result of consumer complaints? If so, please explain.

A.9. If we determine that a customer violated an agreement or 
misused data, we take corrective action, including termination 
of the relationship.

Q.10. What measures do you take to ensure the privacy and 
security of consumer personal and financial information?

A.10. We secure and protect the information entrusted to us by 
building, monitoring and defending information security 
programs built on a foundation of compliance and 
accountability. We proactively manage our programs and 
continuously invest to secure the data we hold on behalf of 
consumers and businesses. We are organized to develop, 
implement and maintain a robust information security program 
consistent with TransUnion's size and complexity. We employ 
multiple overlapping layers of security controls to reduce risk 
and eliminate single points of failure. Our program focuses on 
risk identification and fostering resiliency, all to protect 
TransUnion, our assets, consumers and customers.
    Responsible data stewardship is fundamental to our mission. 
We have developed, and continue to augment, a robust, global 
privacy program to protect consumer information and our data 
assets. Our program is built upon TransUnion's Global Privacy 
Policy which requires compliance across the enterprise, 
including all of TransUnion's business units, as well as 
majority-owned company subsidiaries. Collectively, these 
efforts help ensure all new products and services comply with 
the most current privacy regulations around the world, and meet 
or exceed consumers' evolving privacy expectations.

Q.11. Are any demographic data points such as race, national 
origin or gender included in the data being sold?

A.11. The FCRA prohibits the reporting and collection of such 
information on a consumer's credit report. With respect to non-
FCRA data, management of a consumer's sensitive information is 
governed by a variety of State and Federal requirements noted 
in previous answers.

Q.12. Can consumers select which data points about them that 
can be sold?

A.12. TransUnion's consumer privacy portal offers consumers 
broad opt-out rights regarding covered personal information, 
including the rights to opt-out of: the sale/sharing of 
personal information, use of personal information for automated 
decision-making, use of personal information for cross-context 
behavioral advertising/targeted advertising, and use of 
sensitive personal information.

Q.13. Does your research find that people who live in States 
which have not expanded their Medicaid program have lower 
credit scores due to greater prevalence of medical debt?

A.13. TransUnion does not possess research that evaluates the 
potential correlation between States that have not expanded 
their Medicaid program and States with lower credit scores due 
to greater prevalence of medical debt.

Q.14. As your firm restricts some medical debt from being 
reported, what impact do you think this will have on credit 
scores for States that have not expanded Medicaid? Will they 
most likely still have lower credit scores than those States 
which did expand Medicaid? \3\

     \3\ Andrew Van Dam, ``Analysis--Why the South Has Such Low Credit 
Scores'', The Washington Post (WP Company, February 21, 2023), https://
www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/02/17/bad-southern-credit-scores/.

A.14. Following our response to Question 13, we are unable to 
make assumptions or claims regarding the impacts to scores for 
States that have not expanded Medicaid. We would be happy to 
collaborate with Senator Cortez Masto on exploring policy 
solutions around Medicaid, medical debt collections, and credit 
score-related questions to research policy solutions that 
benefit all consumers.
    We continue to evaluate the system to ensure reported 
tradelines are reflective of a consumer's ability to repay and 
we are continually in dialogue with lenders regarding the 
information they believe is necessary for evaluating risk. We 
would encourage cross-industry collaboration on issues related 
to costs of health care, and medical collections debt.

Q.15. When someone changes their name, is it possible for 
someone to prevent their original name from appearing in their 
credit report to the person or firm which requested the credit 
report? This would be the bank, employer, property manager, 
etc.?

A.15. TransUnion is committed to helping all consumers, 
including transgender individuals, to navigate the name change 
process with ease. As part of this effort, consumers can change 
their first and/or middle names on their credit report by 
providing the appropriate documentation to the CRAs, including 
TransUnion. We are also introducing a process for consumers to 
ensure that their dead name is not displayed on a credit report 
if they so choose. We anticipate this process will be available 
later this year.

Q.16. How can transgender people benefit from having their 
credit history remain after a name change without losing their 
privacy?

A.16. See response to question above.

Q.17. Some have recommended removing all delinquencies from 
credit files after 4 years, instead of 7. How would limiting 
the time that delinquencies could be listed affect credit 
reports and scores?

A.17. The suppression of data or the suspension of some data 
elements that lenders rely on to extend credit to consumers 
would potentially undermine the safety and soundness of 
consumer credit markets. Consumer credit files that are 
prepared and maintained by the CRAs make it possible for 
lenders to determine whether a particular consumer is a good 
credit risk, and lenders rely on credit reports and scores to 
decide whether they should extend credit to consumers. Without 
a comprehensive credit report with a history of good credit, 
lenders would have no choice but to rely on subjective criteria 
rather than objective historical data to mitigate risk of 
delinquent payments. This would also make credit far harder to 
obtain, so a consumer runs the risk of staying credit 
invisible, or outside of the credit system.

Q.18. A recent research paper from the Federal Reserve of 
Minneapolis \4\ found unexplained disparities in denial rates 
for solo applicants compared to dual applicants. In its sample 
of mortgage applications from the confidential Home Mortgage 
Disclosure Act (HMDA) dataset,* 56.1 percent feature a solo 
applicant. Lenders denied 3.7 percent of applications in the 
sample overall; the denial rate for solo applicants is 4.3 
percent compared to 3.0 percent for dual applicants. Adjusting 
for differences in characteristics of solo applicants, the 
denial rate for solo applicants is 4.1 percent compared to 3.0 
percent for dual applicants. The report noted that White 
applicants are the least likely to apply for a mortgage alone. 
Applications submitted by at least one White applicant are over 
50 percent more likely to have a co-applicant than applications 
submitted by at least one Black applicant: 31 percent of 
applications submitted by at least one Black applicant have a 
co-applicant, compared to 48 percent of applications submitted 
by at least one White applicant. In addition, single women over 
62 tend to have higher mortgage rates.

    What insights does your firm have in the credit reports, 
credit scores and mortgage acceptance, and rates offered to 
single borrowers, especially borrowers of color and elderly 
women, compared to White and duo borrowers?

A.18. TransUnion does not possess specific research on this 
topic, but we would be happy to have our Research and 
Statistics group engage with your office to discuss these 
important concerns further. As a general matter, TransUnion 
cannot differentiate between when a consumer is shopping for 
rates vs. when a consumer makes an application, so we cannot 
give definitive numbers regarding single vs. joint application 
acceptance rates.

       RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR HAGERTY
                    FROM CHRIS A. CARTWRIGHT

Q.1. The CFPB's report on tenant screening, released in 
November of last year, took a hostile approach to the practice, 
and neglected to acknowledge the public good that such 
screening services provide.
    Please explain how tenant screening services help both 
landlords and prospective renters, and what effect they have on 
the safety of our communities.

A.1. TransUnion provides an important service to landlords to 
help them make informed decisions and keep tenants safe. A full 
and accurate record of a prospective tenant's credit, criminal, 
and eviction history gives owners and operators the most 
comprehensive picture of the applicant. This is the best way to 
determine an applicant's ability to pay rent, be a positive 
addition to the residential community, and prove whether a 
tenant could be a risk to the safety of others, or to the 
building itself. Any proposal that restricts a housing 
provider's ability to conduct criminal background checks 
inhibits their ability to ensure a safe, secure environment for 
their residents and employees.

Q.2. Do you agree with the CFPB's view that ``Tenant background 
check content for landlords has questionable relevance''?

A.2. No, tenant screening solutions are a vital tool for 
keeping communities safe and for combating rising rental costs. 
By identifying tenants with higher probability of nonpayment, a 
landlord can avoid having to raise rent on other tenants, while 
simultaneously decreasing the likelihood of future evictions. 
The eviction process can take weeks or months and it can cost 
as much as $10,000 in many jurisdictions--these are costs that 
smaller landlords simply cannot bear. Placing smaller landlords 
in the position of having insufficient insights into the 
financial well-being of possible tenants is unfair to the 
landlord and all of the other residents who may face higher 
costs.
                                ------                                


         RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF CHAIR BROWN
                      FROM BRIAN J. CASSIN

Q.1. Congress enacted the Fair Credit Reporting Act to protect 
consumers from harmful and inaccurate reporting errors--errors 
which could result in consumers being declined for mortgages or 
loans for which they should otherwise have qualified. Forced 
arbitration has undermined these critical consumer protections. 
Does your credit reporting agency use forced arbitration to 
resolve consumer disputes over errors?

A.1. Nothing in Experian's contracts with consumers prevents 
consumers from fully vindicating their rights under the FCRA or 
any other applicable State or Federal law. Arbitration only 
applies to customers who have agreed to arbitration by signing 
up for an Experian membership, which provides a variety of 
services. Of the cases brought by consumers who have signed an 
arbitration agreement, only a small number of those cases ever 
result in arbitration. The vast majority are resolved through 
the court system.

Q.2. Is your company still using outsourced vendors from other 
countries to process your disputes? If so, please explain and 
provide the name of the country and vendor.

A.2. Experian does not use outsourced vendors to process 
consumer disputes, we rely on our own employees all of whom 
have had extensive training. Some of these employees are 
located in Costa Rica and Chile.

Q.3. In a January 2023 report, the CFPB noted that they had 
received nearly one million complaints about credit reporting 
and other consumer reporting, but only forwarded 565,000. The 
reduction by over 40 percent is the result of the CFPB's 
efforts to monitor and safeguard its complaint process from 
undisclosed third-party submitters. Is it your position that 
the 565,000 complaints that the CFPB forwarded to you after the 
Bureau had screened for undisclosed third-party involvement are 
still the result of illegitimate credit repair?

A.3. It is our judgement that approximately 81 percent of the 
complaints that we receive through the complaint portal are 
credit repair. Additionally, the CFPB's own complaint portal 
report shows that credit reporting submissions are mainly 
related to disputes about information reported to us by a data 
furnisher, rather than complaints about consumer 
dissatisfaction about something a CRA has done. Disputes 
represent a consumer's long-held right under the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act to challenge the accuracy of items on their 
credit report. It appears that consumers, and particularly 
credit repair companies, are now using the CFPB complaint 
portal as another channel to initiate disputes. In 2021, we at 
Experian flagged 75 percent of complaints coming across the 
portal as credit repair and that number rose to 81 percent in 
2022. Overall, we have seen a 225 percent increase in disputes 
coming into the complaint portal since last year. However, 
every complaint we receive through the CFPB portal is taken 
seriously and responded to in a timely manner.

Q.4. Experian has noted how important it is for people to 
``check for accuracy in [their] credit reports,'' and correct 
errors. In 2020, Experian acquired data broker and tech 
platform, Tapad, explaining that the acquisition would, 
``enhance Experian's digital offerings for advertisers,'' and 
help position Experian ``to take advantage of expansion in the 
market for digital data advertising.'' Should Americans have 
the same ability to manage or fix inaccuracies over data that 
is used for marketing purposes? Please explain.

A.4. Experian Marketing Solutions (EMS) provides all United 
States consumers the ability to (i) access the personal data 
that EMS maintains about them, (ii) opt-out from the sale or 
sharing of such EMS data, use of such EMS data in targeted 
advertising, or use of sensitive personal data about them by 
EMS, (iii) delete such EMS data, and (iv) correct or delete any 
inaccuracies in the personal data that EMS maintains about 
them. These consumer options and our practices comply with, and 
go beyond, what applicable State and Federal privacy laws and 
industry self-regulatory guidelines require.

Q.5. According to a report from the House Select Subcommittee 
on the Coronavirus Crisis, each year your company received 
disputes on about 30 to 40 million individual items of 
information in the credit reports you issued. Yet, according to 
the report, your employees only spend an average of 7.154 
minutes per dispute. How are your employees able to conduct 
``reasonable investigations'' as required by the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act when they only spend a little over 7 minutes 
investigating each dispute?

A.5. Consumers can dispute information on their credit report 
by mail, online, through the Experian app, or by telephone. 
When a consumer contacts Experian to dispute information in 
their credit file, we review and consider all information and 
supporting documents provided by the consumer to determine if 
we can update or delete the disputed information without 
contacting the creditor.
    If we are unable to make a change to the consumer's credit 
report based on the information provided, Experian conveys the 
consumer's dispute along with any relevant additional 
information provided by the consumer, which may include 
documentation and/or an explanation, to the data furnisher to 
verify the accuracy of the disputed information. Experian has 
processes in place to ensure that we provide information to 
furnishers within 5 business days of receipt.
    Once transmitted, the electronic dispute system, e-Oscar, 
requires furnishers to open all supporting documentation 
provided with the dispute. The creditor then has 30 days in 
which to respond to the dispute and they must certify that 
their responses are accurate. We then update the consumer's 
information, if appropriate, based on the response from the 
furnisher. If the furnisher fails to respond to the dispute 
within 30 days, the disputed information is deleted from the 
credit file until the furnisher can certify that the 
information is accurately reported.
    Experian does not side with either the consumer or the 
lender; our process is designed to ensure that the data 
provided to us by lenders is accurate and reflects the 
consumers' payment history. The law prescribes that Experian 
consult the furnisher because they are the holder of the 
account record with the consumer and are in the best position 
to determine whether the information being challenged by the 
consumer is accurate or not.
    If a consumer disagrees with the results of the dispute-
resolution process, we encourage the consumer to go directly to 
the lender and we provide clear contact information for the 
lender in the response we send to the consumer at the 
conclusion of the dispute process. Consumers who are 
unsatisfied with the reinvestigation also have the right to add 
a statement of dispute to their credit report. In addition to 
that right, a consumer who has previously disputed an item can 
initiate a new dispute if they are providing additional 
relevant information.
    Regardless of the outcome of a consumer's dispute, we 
respond to the consumer with an explanation of the outcome. 
This process is clearly established, including all applicable 
timeframes, by the FCRA and is completed within 30 days of our 
receipt of the dispute, and often much sooner.

Q.6. Experian has a product called ConsumerView <SUP>SM</SUP>, 
which is described as ``the largest and most comprehensive 
resource for traditional and digital marketing campaigns. With 
thousands of attributes on more than 300 million consumers and 
126 million households, ConsumerView <SUP>SM</SUP> data 
provides a deeper understanding of your customers, resulting in 
more actionable insights across channel.'' In a brochure about 
it, Experian states that ConsumerView <SUP>SM</SUP> includes, 
``Aggregated credit information'' and ``Financial data 
segments'' including the ``ConsumerView <SUP>SM</SUP> 
Profitability Score, which ranks households most likely to pay 
their debts.'' What is the origin of this ``Aggregated credit 
information'' and information to create a ``Profitability 
Score?'' Does it come from the main credit reporting files?

A.6. Experian Marketing Solutions provides product sets to 
marketers derived from aggregated and summarized information 
from Experian credit file data for the purpose of understanding 
broad consumer trends. This information is completely 
anonymized and merely summarizes financial information by 
market areas, enables insights as to historical financial 
trends, and to develop models to make more informed marketing 
decisions. Clients may only use this data for marketing and 
analytics purposes and not for eligibility or other permitted 
uses under the FCRA.

         RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR REED
                      FROM BRIAN J. CASSIN

Q.1. Please explain your company's current approach to 
incorporating Buy Now, Pay Later (or BNPL) lending into a 
consumer's credit file and describe the specific technological 
or commercial impediments to making sure BNPL repayment history 
is reported and scored in a standardized fashion.

A.1. Experian is actively working with Buy Now Pay Later 
lenders, or BNPL, to establish reporting processes using 
standard industry mechanisms (Metro 2). Becoming a data 
furnisher is a complicated process that requires not only the 
ability to accurately provide tradelines to the credit 
reporting agencies, but also handle disputes and other 
potential consumer inquiries. We are working diligently to 
provide the support BNPL lenders need to be part of the 
ecosystem. At this juncture this is still a relatively new 
initiative and few BNPL providers currently report their loans.
    For the near term, loans reported to Experian will be 
included in the core credit report but not reflected in 
traditional credit scores until models adapt to consider BNPL 
data. We are committed to working with BNPL lenders, banks, and 
the CFPB to establish effective solutions for this data to be 
used in the credit ecosystem in a way that is meaningful to all 
types of lenders and fair to consumers. The CFPB has also 
indicated that BNPL providers should participate in the credit 
reporting system.

Q.2. We have recently heard credible reports of consumers 
receiving dozens or hundreds of unexpected and unwanted phone 
calls and texts, within hours of applying for a mortgage, from 
other lenders offering purportedly better financing. Do you 
make money from selling these so-called ``trigger leads,'' 
which are used to target and spam unsuspecting customers? Do 
you believe dozens or hundreds of these solicitations are a 
nuisance for consumers? Do you have the ability to prevent the 
information that you provide to lenders from being used to 
overwhelm consumers with ads and solicitations? If so, why are 
reports of spam solicitations increasing?

A.2. Experian believes consumers deserve access to fair and 
affordable credit, including mortgages. We empower lenders to 
offer consumers choice in credit terms when shopping for a 
mortgage by alerting them when consumers engage in the mortgage 
marketplace. With a broader range of offers to consider, 
consumers have more options when they need them most. This can 
help consumers save thousands of dollars during the homebuying 
process. In a time when interest rates and housing prices are 
rising, this can in some instances help people afford the right 
home for them.
    We recognize that the current environment, with fewer 
mortgage applications being initiated, has contributed to an 
increase in the number of consumer contacts, and we are 
actively looking at this process. We also recognize that some 
consumers may not be interested in additional financing 
options. Consumers can quickly opt-out of receiving offers by 
visiting www.optoutpresceen.com or www.experian.com at any 
time. Experian processes and incorporates consumer-requested 
opt-outs within 48 hours of receipt.
    The solutions Experian provides to the mortgage market are 
done so in the best interest of consumers and in accordance 
with the requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Our 
clients and partners are contractually required to maintain 
high levels of commitment to the responsible use of data, as 
well as uphold all applicable laws.

Q.3. What additional steps are your company taking to combat 
the recent increase in fraud targeted at service members and 
veterans?

A.3. Service members can sign up for free credit monitoring and 
credit reports at Experian IDnotify<SUP>TM</SUP> for Active 
Military Members (https://www.experian.com/lp/military.html). 
Deployed active-duty service members can place an active-duty 
alert on the credit report to prevent identity theft. More 
generally, all service members and their families can freeze 
their credit report with all three of the national CRAs. As 
with all consumers, the sooner irregularities are detected, the 
easier it is to prevent and remediate identity theft.
    The Experian website also provides significant educational 
resources. For example, recent blog posts specifically warned 
about scams targeted at those in the military and at veterans 
and offered suggestions for how military families can save 
money. Experian also hosts online credit chats with partners 
who serve those in the military, veterans, and their family 
members.
    When a military consumer disputes the accuracy of 
information in the credit report because the consumer believes 
that they have been the victim of fraud or identity theft, 
those cases are escalated to a specialized team dedicated to 
handling this type of dispute.
                                ------                                


               RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF
           SENATOR CORTEZ MASTO FROM BRIAN J. CASSIN

Q.1. Can you explain why consumer complaints about credit 
reporting agencies at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
complaint portal have skyrocketed over the past 2 years? Now, 
about three of four consumer complaints are about credit scores 
and credit reports.

A.1. We have over 220 million consumers in our credit reporting 
database, and submissions made to the CFPB portal represent .04 
percent of consumers in our system. That said, every complaint 
we receive through the CFPB portal is taken seriously and 
resolved in a timely manner.
    The CFPB's report shows that credit reporting submissions 
to the portal are mostly related to disputes about information
reported to us by a data furnisher, rather than complaints 
about something a CRA has done. The Fair Credit Reporting Act 
gives consumers the right to dispute information with CRAs and 
furnishers, but it appears that many consumers are now using 
the CFPB complaint portal to initiate a dispute rather than, or 
in addition to, directly coming to a CRA or furnisher.
    It has also become apparent that a large portion of the 
increase in submissions is related to the activities of credit 
repair clinics. In 2021, we at Experian flagged 75 percent of 
complaints coming across the portal as credit repair, that 
number rose to 81 percent in 2022. Overall, we have seen a 225 
percent increase in disputes coming into the complaint portal 
since last year.
    Credit repair companies charge consumers hundreds or 
thousands of dollars on the promise to remove accurate, but 
negative data from the consumer's credit report. These 
unscrupulous companies then file multiple disputes with the 
bureaus, the CFPB, and lenders, betting on the inability to 
complete a reinvestigation within the statutory 30-day period 
within which disputes must be resolved, causing negative 
information to fall off a consumer's credit report at least 
temporarily. Credit repair companies are also using the portal 
to circumvent existing limitations that prevent third parties 
from filing frivolous disputes with CRAs or directly with 
furnishers.
    The claims these credit repair organizations make to 
consumers are at best misleading and often deceptive. The CFPB 
has brought some enforcement actions against credit clinics for 
the deceitful marketing tactics they use on consumers, but to 
our knowledge has not taken action to prevent this type of 
deceptive and harmful conduct from occurring on the complaint 
portal. The complaint portal is not immune from these kinds of 
companies, and it should not be used by bad actors to harm or 
defraud consumers or cause disruption to CRAs and lenders, 
taking valuable time away from consumers with legitimate 
issues.

Q.2. How is your firm thinking about using the new Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) technologies?
    Does your firm use--or are you considering using AI to 
communicate with consumers, in the dispute process and/or in 
value-added services such as credit scores?

A.2. Experian is committed to using advanced data, analytics, 
and innovative solutions to deliver faster and better services 
to our clients and consumers. We are constantly exploring and 
evaluating new technologies, including artificial intelligence. 
Our commitment is substantially based on a desire to help 
individuals to take control of their financial lives and access 
financial resources, businesses to make smarter decisions, 
lenders to lend more responsibly, and organizations to prevent 
identity fraud. That said, we have implemented rigorous 
standards to ensure that any use of artificial intelligence 
technologies meets all of our business and legal requirements.
    Regardless of the technology deployed, our services must 
comply with all applicable Federal and State laws and leveraged 
safely and responsibly. This includes upholding the highest 
standards of data privacy, accuracy, security, and 
transparency.

Q.3. Does your firm sell consumer information to vendors? If 
so, how can people avoid having their information sold?

A.3. Experian sells credit report information to third-party 
resellers with a permissible purpose under the FCRA. We onboard 
our resellers with rigorous processes in place to verify the 
uses for which third parties are obtaining reports and they 
must operate in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Q.4. If a potential home buyer seeks a mortgage, are there any 
limits to how many vendors can purchase their information and 
how often--and through what means--they can contact the 
potential borrower?

A.4. Experian believes that consumers deserve access to fair 
and affordable credit, including mortgages. We empower lenders 
to offer consumers choice in credit terms when shopping for a 
mortgage by alerting them when consumers engage in the mortgage 
marketplace. With a broader range of offers to consider, 
consumers have more options when they need them most. This can 
help consumers save thousands of dollars during the homebuying 
process. In a time when interest rates and housing prices are 
rising, this can in some instances help people afford the right 
home.
    However, we recognize that the current environment, with 
fewer mortgage applications being initiated, has caused an 
increase in the number of consumer contacts, and we are 
actively looking at this process. We also recognize that some 
consumers may not be interested in additional financing 
options. Consumers can quickly opt out of receiving offers by 
visiting www.optoutpresceen.com or www.experian.com at any 
time. Experian processes and incorporates consumer-requested 
opt-outs within 24-48 hours of receipt.
    The solutions Experian provides to the mortgage market are 
done so in the best interest of consumers and in accordance 
with the requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Our 
clients and partners are contractually required to maintain 
high levels of commitment to the responsible use of data, as 
well as uphold all applicable laws.

Q.5. How does your firm address concerns and complaints from 
consumers who received unwanted solicitations or are upset with 
the lender who they think sold their information to a 
competitor?

A.5. Consumers who choose to not receive offers can simply opt-
out. Every prescreened offer that is delivered to a consumer 
comes with the notice that a consumer can opt-out at any time. 
This is done through: 1-888-5-OPT-OUT (1-888-567-8688), 
www.optoutpre-
screen.com or at www.experian.com.
    Consumers receive tremendous benefits from prescreened 
offers. These benefits range from creating a very competitive 
market for credit cards through perks, points, and lower 
interest rates, to setting the stage for large amounts of 
consumer choice in the mortgage and home equity space. The 
competition fostered in the marketplace by prescreening helps 
to lower the cost of credit to consumers, and to make credit 
more widely available to consumers.

Q.6. How does your company ensure consumer data is only shared 
or sold to legitimate and trustworthy third-party companies? 
How does your firm evaluate these third-party companies?

A.6. Experian adheres to documented and thorough due diligence 
processes for both the initial credentialing and 
recredentialing of Experian clients that ensures the entities 
and prospects are legitimate businesses and have permissible 
purpose to access consumer data. All clients and resellers of 
Experian data are vetted for legal and regulatory compliance 
issues. Prospective users that have a history of significant 
compliance issues may be permanently barred from obtaining 
Experian consumer data either directly or through a reseller.

Q.7. Does your firm sell consumer credit information to 
companies located outside of the United States? If so, for what 
purposes?

A.7. Only on rare occasions will Experian allow its consumer 
credit information to be sold outside of the United States, 
such as with Nova Credit, Inc. (a U.S.-based company that, for 
example, helps American ex-patriots build and obtain credit 
abroad) where they have agreed to abide by all applicable laws 
both foreign and domestic, and which requires consumer consent. 
We also have few clients that will utilize our data within 
their decisioning processes from locations outside of the 
United States (e.g., offshore call centers), with the same 
requirement of complying with all applicable foreign and 
domestic laws. In this case, data does not leave U.S. borders 
since the employees of the client will access the data through 
a secure client system. All entities will undergo the same 
credentialing and recredentialing process described in Question 
6.

Q.8. If multiple consumers complain to your bureau about 
outreach they are getting from an individual company--does your 
company re-evaluate your arrangement with that company?

A.8. Experian utilizes a robust credentialing and 
recredentialing process to evaluate clients to detect items 
such as consumer complaints, unreputable business practices, 
and regulatory violations. Any identified concerns are 
considered when establishing decisions to conduct business with 
the clients.

Q.9. Have you ever declined to sell data to a company as a 
result of consumer complaints? If so, please explain.

A.9. Yes, Experian would and has declined to sell data to 
businesses based on consumer complaints. If Experian identifies 
any concerns with a business involving consumer complaints, 
that information would be taken into consideration in 
determining if Experian would conduct business with that 
entity.

Q.10. What measures do you take to ensure the privacy and 
security of consumer personal and financial information?

A.10. Data privacy is at the heart of what we do and the way we 
work. We are committed to transparent and responsible data 
practices and use. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, first enacted 
almost 50-years ago and updated several times since then, was 
the original financial privacy law on which many privacy laws 
around the world have been modeled. The guiding principles of 
the FCRA, including transparency, accuracy, and security, 
embody how we manage and use data, build products, and conduct 
our business around the world. Our aim is to balance privacy 
expectations with the social and economic benefits derived from 
the responsible use of data. Experian is committed to providing 
consumers with notice, choice, and education about the use of 
their personal information, such as what information is 
collected, how the information is being used, as well as 
providing choices in the use of the information.
    Security comes first at Experian. We continually enhance 
our security infrastructure, practices, and culture across the 
business. We invest heavily in cyber security and have 
specialist teams, state-of-the-art technology, and rigorous due 
diligence procedures to deal with potential threats. Our 
security approach has three tiers: applying tools and processes 
to prevent threats from entering our environment; detecting if 
a threat enters our environment; and mitigating any threats by 
minimizing the potential for information to be extracted from 
our environment.

Q.11. Are any demographic data points such as race, national 
origin or gender included in the data being sold?

A.11. Credit reports do not contain information about gender, 
race, or national origin.

Q.12. Can consumers select which data points about them that 
can be sold?

A.12. Experian complies with all applicable laws governing the 
sale and use of consumer data. The Fair Credit Reporting Act 
strictly governs what data can be included in credit reports 
and the circumstances in which consumer credit data can be 
released. Consumers also have the right to opt-out of having 
their data released for prescreened offers of credit and can do 
so easily at www.experian.com and www.optoutprescreen.com. 
Other privacy laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and 
numerous State laws, further govern the sale and use of data 
outside the context of the FCRA.

Q.13. Does your research find that people who live in States 
which have not expanded their Medicaid program have lower 
credit scores due to greater prevalence of medical debt?

A.13. Experian tracks credit scores on a State-by-State basis 
in an annual report. We have not studied the effect of the 
choices that States have made regarding Medicaid expansion. Our 
most recent findings can be found at What Is the Average Credit 
Score in the U.S.?--Experian: https://www.experian.com/blogs/
ask-experian/what-is-the-average-credit-score-in-the-u-s/. 
Information for consumers managing medical debt can we found at 
How Does Medical Debt Affect Your Credit Score?--Experian: 
https://www.
experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/medical-debt-and-your-credit-
score/.

Q.14. As your firm restricts some medical debt from being 
reported, what impact do you think this will have on credit 
scores for States that have not expanded Medicaid? Will they 
most likely still have lower credit scores than those States 
which did expand Medicaid? \1\

     \1\ Andrew Van Dam, ``Analysis--Why the South Has Such Low Credit 
Scores'', The Washington Post (WP Company, February 21, 2023), https://
www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/02/17/bad-southern-credit-scores/.

A.14. Experian is committed to continue to study the impact 
that medical debt has on consumers while balancing the need to 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
maintain predictive data on the credit file.

Q.15. When someone changes their name, is it possible for 
someone to prevent their original name from appearing in their 
credit report to the person or firm which requested the credit 
report? This would be the bank, employer, property manager, 
etc.?

A.15. In the case of a legal name change for a transgender 
individual, we can suppress the consumer's previous name on the 
credit report. The individual consumer must contact the credit 
bureau to initiate this process. Once we receive the consumer 
request, it typically takes less than 10 days for the 
information to be updated in our system. Once the name has been 
changed, anyone checking the report will only see the new legal 
name. In updating a name, consumers are also advised to update 
their legal name with any creditors and financial institutions 
that may report to Experian to ensure continuity in the 
consumer's report.

Q.16. How can transgender people benefit from having their 
credit history remain after a name change without losing their 
privacy?

A.16. Experian is committed to ensuring that credit reports are 
accurate, which includes accurately reporting a consumer's 
identity. Gender designation is not part of a credit report. We 
also have a process through which an individual who has made a 
legal name change can provide appropriate documentation and 
request their name be updated on their Experian credit report 
while retaining all their credit history.

Q.17. Some have recommended removing all delinquencies from 
credit files after 4 years, instead of 7. How would limiting 
the time that delinquencies could be listed affect credit 
reports and scores?

A.17. The Fair Credit Reporting Act prohibits consumer 
reporting agencies from including in consumer reports most 
adverse information that is older than 7 years. The impact of 
removing negative data after 4 years has not been widely 
studied. It would certainly impact scoring models and 
underwriting models since they are calibrated to the current 7-
year data retention standard. Reducing the length of time that 
all delinquencies may be reported to 4 years could also create 
blind spots for creditors who need to adequately assess risk, 
and ultimately make credit less available or extremely 
expensive for most of the population. Making the determination 
as to the impact of such a change would have to be studied by 
Congress, lenders, and their functional regulators to get to 
the right policy decision as it would broadly impact credit 
underwriting and risk.

Q.18. A recent research paper from the Federal Reserve of 
Minneapolis \2\ found unexplained disparities in denial rates 
for solo applicants compared to dual applicants. In its sample 
of mortgage applications from the confidential Home Mortgage 
Disclosure Act (HMDA) dataset,* 56.1 percent feature a solo 
applicant. Lenders denied 3.7 percent of applications in the 
sample overall; the denial rate for solo applicants is 4.3 
percent compared to 3.0 percent for dual applicants. Adjusting 
for differences in characteristics of solo applicants, the 
denial rate for solo applicants is 4.1 percent compared to 3.0 
percent for dual applicants. The report noted that White 
applicants are the least likely to apply for a mortgage alone. 
Applications submitted by at least one White applicant are over 
50 percent more likely to have a co-applicant than applications 
submitted by at least one Black applicant: 31 percent of 
applications submitted by at least one Black applicant have a 
co-applicant, compared to 48 percent of applications submitted 
by at least one White applicant. In addition, single women over 
62 tend to have higher mortgage rates.

    What insights does your firm have in the credit reports, 
credit scores and mortgage acceptance, and rates offered to 
single borrowers, especially borrowers of color and elderly 
women, compared to White and duo borrowers?

A.18. Experian does not have access to or maintain HMDA-related 
data. Experian receives credit inquiries and new tradelines in 
a credit report, but credit bureaus do not know if an 
application was declined, for what reason, or the terms of the 
loan. Credit reports and scores also do not contain data on 
protected characteristics such as race, gender, marital status, 
or ethnicity. Regulations such as the Equal Credit Opportunity 
Act (ECOA) forbid lenders from discriminating against any 
individual based on protected characteristics.
