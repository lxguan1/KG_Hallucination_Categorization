                FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT
                   APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2024

                              ----------                              


                        WEDNESDAY, JULY 19, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
           Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations,
                                                    Washington, DC.

    The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:45 p.m., in 
room SD-124, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Chris Van 
Hollen (Chairman), presiding.
    Present: Senators Van Hollen, Durbin, Coons, Manchin, 
Hagerty, Collins, Boozman, and Kennedy.

                U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

                OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR VAN HOLLEN

    Senator Van Hollen. This meeting of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Financial Services 
and General Government will come to order.
    I would like to begin by thanking our Ranking Member, 
Senator Hagerty, and the Members of the subcommittee for their 
input and work in getting the FSGG Appropriations Bill through 
our subcommittee and through the Full Committee last week.
    I also want to take this opportunity to thank the Vice 
Chair of the Full Committee, Senator Collins, for working with 
the Chair, Senator Murray, to create the framework that allows 
us to proceed and conduct our business. So thank you, and to 
all the Members of the subcommittee and Full Committee, thank 
you.
    I think Members of the subcommittee know full well that 
this subcommittee covers a broad array of agencies, lots of 
agencies under our jurisdiction, and while we will not be able 
to have an oversight hearing on every single one of those 
agencies, we will be working to conduct more oversight hearings 
over some of the biggest ones, including today, the SEC.
    As part of the Appropriations process, we did not fully 
fund the SEC's request, but I worked with Ranking Member 
Hagerty to propose what we thought adequately supported the 
SEC's needs to ensure market transparency and ensure the 
integrity of those markets. The fiscal year Bill this Committee 
passed last week includes $2.4 billion for the Commission.
    Today, we welcome the Chairman of the SEC, Chairman Gary 
Gensler. Gary Gensler was born and raised in Baltimore City, 
and besides picking the right State to be born in, just a 
matter of good fortune, Mr. Gensler also has many earned 
qualifications that bring him to the position he now holds.
    Mr. Gensler served as the 11th Chairman of the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, and has been a leading 
national expert on blockchain and other modern finance issues. 
He served as a professor of the Practice of Global Economics 
and Management at MIT. He also has considerable experience from 
his time in the private sector as a partner and co-head of 
finance at Goldman Sachs. Those are just a few of the 
touchstones of Mr. Gensler's experience that brings him to this 
position.
    Chairman Gensler has led the SEC with a focus on 
transparency and adaption to changing market conditions. I 
particularly appreciate the updates he has made to insider 
trading disclosure with last year's revisions to Rule 10b5-1, 
on insider trading, an issue that Senator Fischer and I have 
worked on together.
    I also appreciate Chairman Gensler's partnership in the 
implementation of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable 
Act. This was bipartisan legislation. I was pleased to team up 
with Senator Kennedy, also a Member of this Committee, to 
require that all companies that are listed on U.S. exchanges 
comply with the same auditing standards that apply to U.S. 
companies.
    Companies based in China had been playing by their own set 
of rules, and I want to commend Mr. Gensler and the team at the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, PCAOB, for ensuring 
compliance with the requirements of this new law. I know, Mr. 
Chairman, that this is an ongoing effort.
    Senator Kennedy and I also hope to ensure that Chinese 
companies that trade on our exchanges, and all foreign public 
companies trading on our exchanges are held to the same insider 
trading disclosure rules as U.S. companies, and we believe that 
the Holding Foreign Insiders Accountable Act will be part of 
this year's Senate National Defense Authorization Act we hope 
to pass next week. And again, I want to thank Senator Kennedy 
for his leadership in this effort.
    Under the leadership of Chairman Gensler, the SEC has 
responded to changing market conditions, which are only 
becoming more complex. Industries like digital assets and 
crypto currencies have evolved rapidly, growing by billions of 
dollars, in large part due to everyday retail investors seeking 
to grow their wealth. It is critical that the Commission have 
the flexibility to pursue bad actors in our capital markets, 
like FTX, which reportedly profited by improperly acting as an 
exchange platform and defrauding countless investors.
    I also know the SEC is taking lots of public input as it 
seeks to respond to the growing market demand for material 
information about environmental, social, and governance issues. 
Our institutional investment community has also asked for this 
transparency, and markets are responding and evolving, as 
should our regulators.
    There are also many issues regarding new innovations, 
especially AI, that could impact the markets for good or for 
ill. Chairman Gensler gave an important speech about that, I 
believe just yesterday.
    These, colleagues, are just some of the issues I hope we 
can cover today. And before I turn the floor over to Chairman 
Gensler, I recognize Senator Hagerty for his opening remarks. 
And again thank him for his help as we move this legislation 
through the Full Committee and onto the floor.

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BILL HAGERTY

    Senator Hagerty. Chairman Van Hollen, thank you. And I want 
to thank your staff as well for our partnership through this 
appropriations process. I think we have made a lot of progress 
and I appreciate you holding this important hearing today.
    Chairman Gensler, I want to welcome you. I look forward to 
your opening statement as well.
    Last week, the Full Committee approved the fiscal year 2024 
Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Bill 
by a vote of 29-0, which is no small feat. The last time the 
Committee unanimously approved the FSGG Bill was in September 
of 2019. And interesting, that was the last time that the 
Chairman of the SEC came before this subcommittee. So we are 
pleased to see you here today.
    As I mentioned, the last time the subcommittee met, my top 
priority as Ranking Member is to work with my colleagues to 
conduct rigorous oversight, strengthen U.S. financial markets, 
and ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly. The 
American Financial system is one of our greatest assets and 
advantages, and having access to deep liquid markets has been 
critical to our role as the world leader in innovation and 
economic prosperity.
    Congress is currently debating the SEC's budget for fiscal 
year 2024, which is significant. I am familiar with the day-to-
day administrative work of the agency and have great respect 
for the career staff. We need to fund that work. My concern, 
however, is when the agency diverts these resources and spends 
these dollars on initiatives not even within the authority of 
the SEC.
    And here are a few specific examples. Chair Gensler, your 
climate change proposal, many sophisticated commentators 
believe that this is well beyond the SEC's authority. We know 
it is costly, meaning tens of billions of dollars, or more, as 
companies struggle to comply. We know small firms will, 
particularly, be hurt. We also know it is unlikely to provide 
meaningful insight for return-oriented investors, but it will 
be a bonanza for the lawyers who will have a new cottage 
industry.
    Yet, the SEC blindly pushes ahead, consuming vast resources 
now, and that will be compounded when the inevitable lawsuits 
come pouring in.
    Then there are the actions concerning shareholder proposals 
and proxy advisors. A study from Harvard Law School showed that 
five individuals account for roughly 40 percent of all 
shareholder proposals here. That is a remarkable concentration 
of power. Fifty million households have to consider the whims 
of five individuals.
    The SEC had made progress on limiting this abuse of power, 
but this was reflexively undone in 2021 with no study, 
increasing the number of PEP proposals flowing in, and even 
allowing shareholder proposals that would require companies to 
break the law, because shareholder proposals are so inexpensive 
to create, because shareholder proposals are now flooding the 
zone, as a result, investors turn to so-called proxy advisors 
for voting recommendations.
    Many, in effect, outsource their voting to these proxy 
advisors. The two leading firms are a duopoly, both foreign-
owned, wielding vast influence over American public companies, 
which creates many obvious conflicts.
    Mr. Chairman, your predecessor, Jay Clayton, after lengthy 
public comment, made changes to the regulation of these proxy 
advisor firms, requiring them to be more transparent and to 
give companies time to correct proposals' errors, including 
those that recommend votes for proposals that would require 
them to break the law. You took away that transparency and the 
opportunity for better information.
    So by virtue of your actions, you increase the business of 
the proxy firms, made them less accountable, and reduced the 
quality of information available to shareholders. This too is 
now being litigated over whether, through this process, you 
failed to follow the Administrative Procedure Act.
    Regardless of the outcome, I can tell you that these so-
called ``proxy advisors'' are making our financial markets 
significantly weaker and less democratic.
    There are other examples: shortened comment periods, 
creating related proposals as separate to avoid considering the 
cumulative and combined effects, introducing new Final Rules 
that include key points not in the proposal subject to public 
comment, the list goes on.
    This issue is not unique to the SEC. Like Lina Khan at the 
FTC, ignoring procedural requirements and losing in court, 
seems to be worth the price to push our markets to the left. In 
fact, in the enforcement arena, it seems willing to bring cases 
that you must know have very high odds of losing. And perhaps 
you think making a statement is worth the loss.
    Well, what do you say to the person who has to defend 
themselves in one of these messaging cases? Do you apologize? 
Do you thank them? There is no good answer here, because in 
America, we should never use our law enforcement authority on 
innocent people to make statements, and we certainly shouldn't 
hamper the efficiency and competitiveness of our capital 
markets to score political points.
    While we need referees that enforce the market rules and 
punish bad actors, I am concerned that the SEC has moved well 
beyond its role as a market regulator, and is seeking to make 
policies that are both beyond its authority and destructive to 
our economy.
    In summary, this Committee's job is to ensure the SEC has 
the resources it needs to fulfill its statutory duties, and 
that it is using those resources appropriately.
    And your job, Mr. Chairman, is to be a responsible steward 
of those resources and stay within your boundaries.
    I am concerned that that is not happening. This requires 
accountability, yet inadequate responses to Congressional 
directives and questions, including many that I have sent 
myself, suggest a resistance to accountability. And that makes 
today's hearing all the more important.
    So I look forward to your opening statement, Mr. Chairman, 
and to the opportunity to discuss these matters further. Thank 
you.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator Hagerty, and I don't 
know if the Vice Chair wants to--okay, thank you.
    So let me just turn the floor over to you now, Chairman 
Gensler, for your statement. If you could keep it within 5 
minutes, that would be helpful to the Committee. And I should 
say, if you see Members popping up and down, we are going to 
have a series of five votes, so we will probably be playing a 
little musical chairs up here. But please begin.
STATEMENT OF HON. GARY GENSLER, CHAIRPERSON
    Chairman Gensler. Thank you and good afternoon, Chair Van 
Hollen, Ranking Member Hagerty, Vice Chair Collins, and Members 
of the subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me here to testify 
today on the Securities and Exchange Commission's fiscal year 
2024 Budget Request.
    And as is customary, I would like to note that my views are 
my own, as Chair of the SEC, I am not speaking on behalf of my 
fellow Commissioners or the SEC staff. I also wrote this 
myself; it was not done by generative AI. Just to make that 
clear.
    I really, I want to thank this Committee for the approval 
last week of the funding the SEC at the levels that you just 
mentioned. While that funding would allow the SEC to continue 
to operate at its current level, it is $73 million less than 
the fiscal 2024 request. Thus, I just want to--the testimony 
that I submitted for the record is the full President's budget 
request.
    Just to put it in context, the difference, what it will 
mean is; we will not be able to hire additional staff. I think 
we put in for about 170 more people, and some additional 
important technologies to watch out for the investing public 
process tips, review public company disclosures. But again, I 
do appreciate it, and if it helps, getting a unanimous vote, I 
will come back any year you want, Chair Van Hollen and Ranking 
Member Hagerty.
    To put all of this in context, the SEC now, though, is just 
about 3 percent larger than it was 7 years ago, in 2016, in 
terms of headcount. The bulk of this year's budget request 
would be to support currently authorized staffing levels given 
inflation. The SEC is critical to the American public. For 90 
years, the Federal Securities Laws, and the work to oversee 
them, have played a crucial role in good times and in bad 
times, in times of stress, and the laws benefit investors, 
issuers, and the markets in the middle.
    I think the core principles of U.S. Securities Regulation 
have contributed to America's economic success and geopolitical 
standing. And that is really the key for our future 
generations. The agency's clients are ultimately 330 million 
Americans, your constituents, who invest in their 401(k)s, 
IRAs, trade through brokerage apps, take out mortgages, auto 
loans, robo-advisers, and the like, and access the capital 
markets with good ideas to build businesses.
    We have seen tremendous growth and change in our markets, 
and more people than ever participating. Just in the last 5 
years, the number of clients of investment advisors grew 70 
percent. During the same period, average daily trading in the 
equity markets have more than doubled.
    Technology is also rapidly transforming our markets and 
business models, whether it is electronic trading, the cloud, 
artificial intelligence, of course, predictive data analytics. 
And the Chair also mentioned things about, what I would call, 
not your words, the Wild West of the Crypto Markets, rife with 
noncompliance, where investors have put hard-earned assets at 
risk in a highly speculative asset class.
    Such growth and rapid change also means more possibility 
for wrongdoing. As the cop on the beat, we must be able to meet 
the match of bad actors. Thus, it takes a sense, takes time, 
and it makes sense for the SEC to grow along with the 
expansion. Again, we are just about the size we were 7 years 
ago.
    With the Committee's help, this year, for fiscal 2023, we 
were able to get appropriated funds to add 400 positions that 
is on a base of about 4,500. And given the Appropriations' 
timing, the bulk of the hires are still being on-boarded during 
the second half of this year. Thus, the fiscal year 2024 
request seeks the full-year funding for those staff, plus 170 
more.
    I also want to mention our efforts to reduce costs. We have 
worked with GSA to right-size our leasing footprint, and we 
will vacate one of our three headquarter buildings here in 
Washington; they are right by each other. But we think this is 
important. This will save about $14 million per year in 
savings. We are looking at other right-sizing around our 11 
Regional Offices.
    As this committee continues its work, it is worth noting 
that the SEC's funding is deficit-neutral. We charge fees, and 
that covers our full cost. And this has been since the 1930s.
    Two years into this role, I am so grateful to work 
alongside remarkable staff and my fellow Commissioners, to help 
maintain America's capital markets, the best in the world. We 
can't take the leadership for granted, though, and so the 
fiscal year 2024 budget request would give the agency the 
resources to better protect the American public.
    I am pleased to take your questions.

    [The statement follows:]
               Prepared Statement of Gary Gensler, Chair,
                   Securities and Exchange Commission
    Good afternoon, Chair Van Hollen, Ranking Member Hagerty, and 
members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me to testify today 
on the Securities and Exchange Commission's fiscal year 2024 budget 
request. As is customary, I'd like to note that my views are my own as 
Chair of the SEC, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow 
Commissioners or the SEC staff.
                   protecting the public for 90 years
    The SEC is critical to the American public. For 90 years, the 
Federal securities laws--and our work to oversee them--have played a 
crucial role in good times and in times of stress. These laws, the 
first of which was enacted in 1933, benefit investors, issuers ranging 
from startups to multinational corporations, and the markets in the 
middle. The core principles of U.S. securities markets regulation have 
contributed to America's economic success and geopolitical standing 
around the globe.
    This agency's clients are the 330 million Americans--your 
constituents--who invest in their 401(k)s and IRAs, trade through 
brokerage apps, take out mortgage or auto loans, or use robo-advisers. 
They're also Americans accessing the capital markets to fund their 
businesses from small to large, their new ideas and innovations. We 
oversee broker-dealers; stock exchanges; clearinghouses; investment 
companies, such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds; investment 
advisers; and public company issuers, among other participants in our 
financial markets.
    It's for the investing public and issuers that our staff must 
continue to drive efficiencies, help promote for financial stability, 
and modernize our rulesets for today's $100 trillion capital markets as 
well as today's technologies, in a manner consistent with our 
Congressional authorities.
Growth and Change in the Markets
    We've seen tremendous growth and change in our markets. More people 
than ever are participating--trading and using tools and technologies 
that were unavailable even a few years ago.
    For example, from 2017 to 2022, the number of clients of registered 
investment advisers grew nearly 70 percent from 34 million to 57 
million. During that same period, average daily trading in the equity 
markets more than doubled from more than 30 million transactions to 
more than 77 million.
    Technology is rapidly transforming our markets and business models. 
These changes range from electronic trading and the cloud to artificial 
intelligence and predictive data analytics, just to name a few. There 
has been dynamic change in communications to and among investors, from 
Reddit forums to celebrity influencers. Further, we've seen the Wild 
West of the crypto markets, rife with noncompliance, where investors 
have put hard-earned assets at risk in a highly speculative asset 
class.
    Such growth and rapid change also mean more possibility for 
wrongdoing. As the cop on the beat, we must be able to meet the match 
of bad actors. Thus, it makes sense for the SEC to grow along with the 
expansion and increased complexity in the capital markets.
    I am proud of this agency. I am proud of our dedicated staff. It 
has done remarkable work with limited resources. With funding to meet 
the scale of our mission, we can be an even stronger advocate for the 
American public--investors and issuers alike.
    Further, while recent market volatility raises many important 
issues for policymakers and the American public, it is also a reminder 
of the SEC's need to be adequately resourced.
                             budget request
    I am pleased to support the President's fiscal year 2024 request of 
$2.436 billion for SEC operations, to put us on a better track for the 
future. The bulk of the increase would be to support currently 
authorized staffing levels given inflation. In addition, we've 
requested $39.6 million for needs supporting General Services 
Administration (GSA)-led real estate projects.
    Though in this testimony I'm discussing the full request, I want to 
thank this Committee for its bipartisan approval last week on the bill 
that would fund the SEC at $2.364 billion, which would allow the SEC to 
continue operating at its current level.
    To put this in context, with this Committee's help, fiscal year 
2023 funding for the first time would bring the agency's staffing back 
above where we were 7 years ago. The SEC this year is expected to be 
approximately 3 percent larger than it was in fiscal year 2016. 
Meanwhile, the demands on our talented staff have grown dramatically.
    The agency's oversight function is vast. In addition to the 
approximately 40,000 entities I mentioned above, we oversee credit 
rating agencies, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the 
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Municipal Securities 
Rulemaking Board, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, and 
the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
    In fiscal year 2023, the number of positions funded by Congress was 
5,303, a much-needed increase of 400. We're now in the process of 
filling those positions. The fiscal year 2024 request seeks funding for 
an additional 170 positions, as well as full-year funding for those 
staff hired in fiscal year 2023. Considering full-time equivalents 
(FTEs)--or actual time worked--the fiscal year 2024 request would 
support 5,139 FTEs.
    As this Committee considers its work, it's worth noting the SEC's 
funding is deficit- neutral; appropriations are offset by transaction 
fees.
    The SEC has 30 Divisions and Offices across our 11 regional 
locations and Washington, DC headquarters. I'm summarizing below the 
budget requests for our six Divisions and will briefly touch on 
technology and real estate. For further details as well as a review of 
the other offices of the SEC, please reference the fiscal year 2024 
Congressional Budget Justification.\1\

    \1\ See Securities and Exchange Commission, ``Fiscal Year 2024 
Congressional Budget Justification'' (March 10, 2023), available at

justification_final-3-910.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full-time equivalents (FTEs) at the SEC and in individual Divisions. 
        Overall SEC FTEs include all Offices and Divisions.

        [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
        
                      enforcement and examinations
    The Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations account for about 
half of the SEC's staff. Without examination of compliance with and 
enforcement of our rules and laws, we can't instill the trust necessary 
for our markets to thrive. Stamping out fraud, manipulation, and abuse 
lowers risk in the system. It protects investors and reduces the cost 
of capital. The whole economy benefits from that.
Division of Enforcement
    The SEC received more than 35,000 separate tips, complaints, and 
referrals from whistleblowers and others in fiscal year 2022. To give 
context, this is more than double the number we received in fiscal year 
2016.
    During the same period, the Division shrank 5 percent.
    Even with limited resources, the Division brought more than 750 
enforcement actions in fiscal year 2022, a 9 percent increase over the 
prior year. Our actions resulted in orders for $6.4 billion in 
penalties and disgorgement.
    Meanwhile, rapid technological innovation in the financial markets 
has led to misconduct in emerging and new areas, not least in the 
crypto space. Addressing this requires new tools, expertise, and 
resources.
    The additional staff will provide the Division with more capacity 
to meet these challenges, investigate misconduct on a larger scale, and 
accelerate the pace of enforcement investigations to resolution.
    This year's request would grow the team and get the Division to 
just 4 percent more than it was in fiscal year 2016.
Division of Examinations
    The Division of Examinations serves on the front lines to help 
ensure firms comply with the law.
    In fiscal year 2022, we conducted more than 3,000 examinations 
across our tens of thousands of registrants, from investment advisers 
to broker-dealers to exchanges, to ensure they are following their 
legal obligations to customers, including seniors and other vulnerable 
investors.
    Importantly, the Division is the first line of defense for the 
investing public relying on investment advisers. Their numbers have 
grown significantly in the last 5 years. Registered investment advisers 
grew by 20 percent--to about 15,000, up from approximately 12,500 in 
2017. During the same period, the number of private funds advised by 
registered investment advisers increased by 50 percent to approximately 
50,000. This stretches thin the limited resources of the Division.
    Further, we work in parallel with self-regulatory organizations to 
examine registered broker-dealers; in each of the last 5 years, we 
jointly examined nearly half of them--even as the number of daily 
transactions in the equity markets more than doubled.
    Our fiscal year 2024 request would help the Division grow to 1,144 
FTEs, allowing it to keep pace with the market challenges of the last 
decade. The majority of this increase relates to full-year funding for 
those staff positions authorized and hired in fiscal year 2023.
    These additional resources would strengthen the Division's ability 
to protect American families by addressing risks in the crypto markets, 
cyber and information security, and the resiliency of critical market 
infrastructure.
                         programmatic divisions
    Next, I will turn to our three programmatic Divisions.
Corporation Finance
    The Division of Corporation Finance oversees the disclosures of 
public companies so that investors can make informed investment 
decisions. It's important for investors to receive useful, timely, and 
accurate disclosure.
    During the last 3 years alone, the number of reporting companies 
the Division oversees has increased by 18 percent to 7,836, primarily 
due to initial public offerings. In addition, merger activity has more 
than tripled 2020 levels in the last two fiscal years. In contrast, the 
Division's staff is still approximately 17 percent below fiscal year 
2016.
    Today's budget request would grow the team to 454 FTEs. With this 
increase, the Division still would be 5 percent smaller than it was in 
fiscal year 2016. Nonetheless, additional resources would allow the 
Division to serve investors more ably as markets grow and evolve.
Investment Management
    The Division of Investment Management oversees the funds and 
advisers that steward nest eggs for millions of American investors.
    It oversees more than 30,000 registered entities, including more 
than 17,000 registered funds and 15,000 investment advisers.
    As discussed earlier, we've seen significant growth in the number 
of investment advisers and private funds. Further, the assets managed 
just by private funds, now at approximately $25 trillion in gross 
assets, have surpassed the size of the entire U.S. commercial banking 
industry of approximately $23 trillion.
    Overall, the combined assets managed by registered investment 
companies, private funds, and separately managed accounts the Division 
oversees has surpassed $100 trillion. Given this growth in the markets, 
we've asked for funding to support 238 FTEs.
Trading and Markets
    The Division of Trading and Markets serves on the front line for 
maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Market monitoring and 
supervision are essential parts of the Division's activity--especially 
during times of market stress.
    The markets and the market participants we oversee represent a 
significant and growing number of market transactions as well as volume 
of trades. The Division oversees more than 3,500 broker-dealers, 24 
national securities exchanges, 99 alternative trading systems, 50 
security-based swap dealers, and seven active registered clearing 
agencies, among other entities. Further, the Division is responding to 
an increasing number of public inquiries, up by more than 67 percent 
since fiscal year 2019 to approximately 20,000 inquiries in fiscal year 
2022.
    In fiscal year 2024, we've requested 309 FTEs to support this 
important function of the Commission.
                       economic risk and analysis
    Economic analysis is critical to all of the agency's work. The 
Division of Economic and Risk Analysis supports the Commission in every 
role, whether it's enforcement or examinations, monitoring the markets, 
or rulemaking.
    In the Enforcement context, the Division's staff is instrumental in 
identifying potential wrongdoing, assessing ill-gotten gains, and 
working to return funds to harmed investors.
    The Division's economists are involved in every aspect of the 
agency's rulemaking. Proposing and adopting releases include economic 
analyses that consider the costs and benefits of our rules as well as 
their effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Those 
analyses are included in proposing releases that are put out for public 
comment, and staff throughout the agency actively engages with the 
public to receive input, including on the economic analyses.
    Fiscal year 2023 has gotten us to modestly above where we were in 
2016 for FTEs. Given the critical nature of the Division's work, 
though, for fiscal year 2024, we've asked for funding to support 198 
FTEs.
                           additional matters
Technology
    We live in transformational times. The amount of data analysis that 
the SEC processes in the Division of Enforcement alone has grown 20 
percent year over year for the last 3 years. Cyber threats have placed 
our financial sector on high alert. As technologies evolve, it is 
important that the SEC's information technologies follow suit.
    Thus, we have requested $393 million to support the Commission's 
data analysis, cybersecurity, and other IT needs. This request assumes 
full use of an additional $50 million from the SEC Reserve Fund for 
multi-year IT projects and programs. To put these figures in context, 
this spending is dwarfed by what some of the biggest market 
participants spend in a month on technology.
Real Estate
    Another important part of our budget is for offices and leases. We 
have offices in Washington, DC, and 11 other places. The total cost in 
fiscal year 2023 was 5 percent of our budget.
    Over the years, we've worked with the GSA to rightsize our leasing 
footprint. In the last 9 years, we have shed 140,000 rentable square 
feet across our facilities. We are in the process of shedding another 
30,000 rentable square feet in our San Francisco and Fort Worth 
regional offices.
    Further, we are preparing to vacate one of our three headquarters 
buildings in Washington, DC, by the end of this fiscal year, resulting 
in a reduction of 210,000 square feet of space and approximately $14 
million per year in savings.
    The GSA also secured a new lease to move the SEC headquarters in 
Washington to another building. The separate fiscal year 24 request of 
$39.6 million would support GSA's work on buildout and move-related 
costs for this effort and for the replacement lease for our Atlanta 
office. The SEC proposes to offset these costs with fee collections and 
return any unused amounts to fee payers or the Treasury after project 
completion.
    With the finalization of a new Collective Bargaining Agreement, we 
look forward to reassessing our facility needs and working with GSA on 
efforts to relinquish additional space it deems marketable in the 
coming years.
                               conclusion
    Two years into this role, I am grateful to work alongside this 
remarkable staff and my fellow Commissioners to help maintain America's 
capital markets--the best in the world. We can't take our leadership in 
capital markets for granted, though.
    The SEC is working hard day in and day out to keep pace with the 
dramatic growth and change in the markets. This fiscal year 2024 budget 
request would give the agency resources to better protect the American 
public.
    I thank the Committee for providing me the opportunity to summarize 
this budget request. I am pleased to take your questions.

    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Chairman Gensler. And I 
think what we will do, is we will have 6-minute rounds of 
questions. And if people want more than one round, we will try 
and accommodate that as well.
    So Mr. Gensler, you talked a little bit about the ``Wild 
West of Crypto Currencies''. I would like you just to take a 
few minutes to talk about some of the fundamental issues at 
stake here, and the issues of jurisdiction regarding the SEC, 
the CFTC, which you used to chair, and how we deal with these 
entities that people are trying to figure out whether they are 
fish or fowl.
    Chairman Gensler. I thank you for that. The investing 
public, not just here in this country, but around the globe, 
has taken an interest in these crypto assets, the so-called 
crypto tokens or currencies. And generally speaking, there is 
some, group of entrepreneurs behind those projects.
    And what we have in America is laws that are clear, that 
are on the books, that if you are raising money from the 
public, and the public is anticipating profits based on the 
efforts of others; that comes under the Securities laws. This 
is something that was written in the 1930s, but as recently as 
Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote an opinion about 
40 years ago, that Congress painted with a broad brush to 
protect the investing public.
    And so at the core, that is a question: How many of these 
15- to 20,000 tokens have attributes that they are investment 
contracts under the law? Investment contracts are part of the 
Securities Law, and many of them have a group of entrepreneurs 
in the middle, and investors are anticipating profits based on 
the efforts of that group of parties.
    And then there are the companies that then are facilitating 
investment in it; they can call themselves crypto lending, 
crypto trading, and the like. We at the SEC have very robust 
authorities around these platforms. You asked me about my 
current job--my former job, a great agency, I was so proud to 
chair that agency too, the CFTC, doesn't have similar 
authorities.
    So to the extent that some tokens are not what I might call 
crypto security tokens, but they are non-securities, our sister 
agency, our sibling agency, under Chair Benham, has authorities 
over there, but they are not, they are frankly not as robust as 
what we have.
    We are a disclosure-based regime, and if I can close on 
this, we are a disclosure-based regime, and so when the 
investing public is anticipating profits based on the efforts 
of others, it is best that those others, you know, give full, 
fair, and truthful disclosure. This is a field that has been 
rife with fraud, and scam, and hucksters, there are also good-
faith actors.
    Our goal at the SEC is to bring the field into compliance 
within the Securities Law where these tokens--and not 
prejudging any one of them--where they are securities, and then 
the platforms themselves, that they come into compliance, 
rather than what they are doing, often now, out of compliance, 
is not protecting the investing public against fraud 
manipulation, commingling their functions, and often in 
conflict with their investors, trading against their investors.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, as you know, I think we, on a 
bipartisan basis, think this is an important, ongoing 
conversation about the contours of policy. I just want to 
express my thanks to you and your team at the SEC, for being 
important cops on the beat, and exercising the authorities that 
you do have under current law, to go after bad actors that are 
attempting to defraud investors and the public. We talked a 
little bit earlier, offline, about the issues of whether or not 
your budget can accommodate new technology investment, right?
    And we are talking about cryptocurrency, which we weren't 
talking about, at least here on the Hill, 10 years ago. 
Technology obviously is always on the move. I guess my question 
to you is where do you see the SEC's budget capacity going when 
it comes to keeping up with technology? And if you could also 
take a moment to comment on the AI, both risks and/or promise.
    Chairman Gensler. So as you mentioned, we have about, for 
2024, looking for about looking for about $2.4 billion, all 
paid for by transaction fees. But only about one out of 6 
dollars, or about $400 million of that is technology. Often to 
keep up with the Legacy systems that we have, and we could, 
certainly, with this Committee's help in Congress' helped, use 
more in the technology area.
    In terms of artificial intelligence, I think it is the most 
transformative technology of our times, every bit as 
transformative as the Internet in the 90s, but the mass 
production of automobiles in the 1920s. I mean, I think it will 
change the job markets, it will be--have to be consideration 
for other members, and other responsibilities around national 
security, and geopolitical competition, and so forth.
    But as it relates to finance, just as it relates to the 
SEC, I would mention three quick things: One, fraud is fraud. 
If you use artificial intelligence to deceive the public, it is 
still under the Securities laws. Two, with the algorithms, 
parties are now thinking about optimizing the communications to 
investors, not just on what is good for the investors, but 
maybe what is good for the advisor or broker-dealer. And it 
will still have to put the investor first, not the robo-
advisor, or robo-broker first.
    And thirdly, I do think, longer-term, it is going to create 
fragility, and the financial crisis of 2028 or 2033, somebody 
is going to turn around and say, well, I didn't realize that 
all these algorithms are based upon some base foundation model, 
and the mortgage market all went one way, maybe, or this 
market.
    I am not trying to predict which market, but these, the 
economics of artificial intelligence, I think, will lead to 
one, two, maybe three base models. And it is simply because it 
takes so much computational power, so much data, and what is 
called network effects. And artificial intelligence is really 
going to drive a lot of efficiency. It will probably boost some 
productivity, boost our economic growth, but there are also 
these challenges.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, thank you. We hope we can work 
with you to get ahead of them as much as possible.
    Senator Collins.
    Senator Collins. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Gensler, you have stated in the past that you 
believe that there is benefit to being in the office. Today you 
told us that the SEC will be getting rid of one of its three 
buildings in which its employees work. And in February, the 
SEC's employee union reached an agreement with the agency that 
requires employees to return to the office only 2 days for each 
pay period, that is 4 days per month.
    Now, I will quickly concede that there are some jobs that 
can be done remotely, but when you are serving the public, when 
you are helping to protect consumers, when you are dealing with 
large financial firms, you need people to be at work. You need 
people to be in the office. You need people to benefit from the 
conversations that they have with their fellow staff members 
and regulators.
    So I guess my question would be, why did the SEC agree to a 
policy that is going to result in so few employees actually 
coming to work only 4 days a month? That strikes me as not 
serving the public.
    Chairman Gensler. So if I might, I appreciate the question, 
and let me just start with, the workforce, the staff, I 
couldn't be prouder of the SEC workforce. We have had a very 
robust work-from-home policy before COVID that was not as--not 
the one that you just mentioned, but was 6 days in the office 
out of a pay period and so forth. And then COVID came, and we 
actually found that the staff could be quite productive.
    And then the bargaining unit, in good faith, bargaining 
with management, we ended up, this is a matter of record, at 
impasse over these matters, and the impasse panel came out with 
where we are, which you accurately said, 2 days at a minimum in 
the office. But there are also provisions in the arrangements 
that, for examinations, for enforcement, for other parts of the 
agency, where it is appropriate, management can call in and we 
do on-site examinations of financial advisors and--I am sorry--
investment advisors and the like.
    So we have found, during this period, this sort of forced-
upon-us period in 2021 and 2022, that our productivity was 
quite strong, and the staff, the dedicated staff, continued. 
But, as I say, we did end up bargaining in good faith, and this 
is where we landed.
    Senator Collins. Well, this does not strike me as a good 
deal for the taxpayers or for the consumers that you are 
charged with protecting. I understand that some employees are 
at the job site; that makes sense to me. I also understand that 
there are some jobs that can be done effectively, fully remote, 
and under this employee contract, individuals who are in 
positions that are fully remote will not be required to return 
to the office at all. Surely, there is a need even for fully 
remote individuals to come to the office for meetings 
occasionally.
    I am just concerned as we have seen at the IRS, and the 
Social Security Administration, that what happens is consumers 
get the short stick, and that the individuals, the companies, 
and financial advisors whom you are regulating are going to 
find it difficult to get information. And many of them have 
brought their employees back to work, and they are certainly 
back to work more than 4 days per month. So I want to express 
directly, too, my deep concern and disappointment about that 
agreement.
    I want to turn quickly to another issue, and that has to do 
with your rulemaking process. And I would associate myself with 
some of the comments made by the Vice Chair on whether 
stakeholders are being given adequate time to respond to new 
rulemaking, whether provisions are being included in the Final 
Rule that were not in the Proposed Rule, and whether or not 
there is sufficient input going from the public and from the 
regulated into your rulemaking.
    So if you could respond to how your current process tracks 
with your prior SEC practice.
    Chairman Gensler. We put proposed rules out to notice and 
comment, according to the Administrative Procedures Act, and we 
put economic analysis in. On average, I am just looking at some 
notes here, but on average, from the time that we vote on 
something, it has been about 70 to 75 days out to public 
comment.
    What we also find during that two or two-and-a-half months, 
that is kind of the first deadline, but there are some people 
that will continue to send in comments, and we do, as best we 
can, to continue to take meetings and talk about. And this is 
just an average, just to give you a sense. But on average, it 
is about 13 months between proposing a rule and finalizing a 
rule.
    Now, some of them take a-year-and-a-half, some we never 
finalize, but I am just saying, on average, it is about 13 
months. And so, on average it has been about two-and-a-half 
months that the formal period is, and then we continue to take 
meetings and have input. We document it in the file, of course. 
Even these discussions here today, only one of five 
Commissioners, but the discussions we will have here today will 
influence me as a Commissioner, as we think about that Final 
Rule.
    Senator Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Durbin. After the questioning by Senator Collins, I 
want to say for the record that Senator Van Hollen is here 
today. He had to go vote on the floor, and he will be 
returning.
    Senator Manchin.
    Senator Manchin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Chairman 
Gensler, thank you for being here. I think you know, I sent a 
letter to you concerning on the SEC's ruling, if you will, or 
presumed ruling, and we talked briefly about that. So what I 
really wanted to do is make sure that we have the Scope 3 
emissions.
    I have a big--I have really hard concerns about the ESG 
because if ESG is not taken with the same light that, 
basically, geopolitical unrest that we see around the world, 
you are putting us in a very unfair advantage--or 
disadvantage--can be very harmful. I say that because friends 
that I have over the UK, when it came to survival, when it came 
to freezing to death, or basically being able to maintain any 
type of quality of life with all the stresses because of the 
Ukraine war, they threw all caution out the window.
    And I think, you know, because they were just trying to 
survive, so the environment took a way, way far back seat. And 
if we do it properly, if we have a balance between the energy 
and the economy, we should never get in that disproportionate, 
unbelievable situation.
    So on that, really, my letter addresses those concerns, and 
if you all could give it to consideration as far as the Scope 3 
emissions, it could really be devastating to the smaller 
operations; and if I am understanding, you all have already, I 
think, evaluated. You have, of the 500 largest Russell 1000 
Index companies, 90 percent of them already published, 
substantially, sustainability reports calling into climate.
    So it is putting a lot of burden on the food chain way down 
low, and people are just going to--you know, we are hearing an 
awful lot of comments on that; so if you want to just say 
something about that, or if you are aware of that, and 
considering that.
    Chairman Gensler. I thank you for the question. We just, I 
want to say this as I have said before, we are merit neutral at 
the SEC. Congress debated this 90 years ago; it is a really 
important feature, investors get to decide what investments 
they make, and we are a disclosure-based agency.
    And like the statistic, you said, investors are already 
relying on climate risk disclosures by companies. Well over 
half of the top-thousand companies already make disclosures, 
not because we mandated, Senator, but they are making it 
because their investors want that information to make 
investment decisions.
    So we took it up to make a proposal to bring some 
consistency and comparability to a lot that is already 
happening. To your question, if I might say, about so-called 
``Scope 3'', this is for the other senators and Members, this 
is like supply chain, greenhouse gas emissions, or customers, 
you know.
    Senator Manchin. Correct. We take it, and the chicken, and 
chicken houses occur from the chicken, and you know what, all 
the way up to the--where you eat the chicken.
    Chairman Gensler. I think that is a good way to say it, 
Senator.
    Senator Manchin. Thank you.
    Chairman Gensler. I have got, I think I have got it. And 
we, when we made a proposal, we even thought that it was this 
so-called ``Scope 3'', was at a different stage of development, 
different stage of disclosures, fewer companies making the 
disclosure. We took a tiered approach at that time.
    Senator Manchin. Okay.
    Chairman Gensler. But I would say this; we have heard the 
feedback, and it is from the agriculture community, it is from 
the small- and medium-sized enterprises, and around Scope 3 
discussions, and I ensure you that we only have, you know, a 
rule that we are trying to finalize to bring comparability and 
consistency about the public companies. And a lot of comments 
came in about alternatives to ensure that we don't 
inadvertently somehow, that the reach of the rule doesn't go to 
the nonpublic companies, which I think is, that is your 
consideration.
    Senator Manchin. Yes. The small, the small end farmers, the 
small end producers, those people who are beholden to the 
larger corporations, and they really dictate to them what they 
do and how they do it, anyway. And they are under the gun no 
matter what. But you put an extra burden on them, and they are 
marginal sometimes now.
    Chairman Gensler. But I assure you, we have heard loud and 
clear. I can't prejudge where we will end up. I mean, staff has 
to pull this together. We have got 15-16,000 comments on this 
one, so it is likely to take more than that, average 13 
months----
    Senator Manchin. We can get you a lot more if you need 
them.
    Chairman Gensler. What is that?
    Senator Manchin. We can get you a lot more if you need 
them.
    Chairman Gensler. All right.
    Senator Manchin. I will give you all the ones we are 
getting, and we will get--transfer them to you. I understand 
that under your tenure, the SEC has proposed twice as many 
rules as your predecessors. In the spring of this year you 
announced your intention to finalize more than two dozen of 
these rules.
    My colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as 
businesses of all sizes have expressed concern SEC has provided 
insufficient time for public comment. These are probably things 
you have heard anyway, particularly given the significance of 
many of the rules. Constituents and companies affected by these 
rules believe comment periods should fall in the projection of 
60- and 90-day range. However, under your tenure, 74 percent of 
the rulemaking has been a 30-day comment period.
    So given the importance of providing maximum certainty to 
the public in changes in the financial markets, will you commit 
to adhering closure to the traditional public comment periods 
for future rulemaking, which the people think they just need to 
get a proper cross-section?
    Chairman Gensler. So I am sure your staff did very good 
work, but if I can just----
    Senator Manchin. Well, you can correct it, sometimes, you 
know, we even make mistakes.
    Chairman Gensler. No, no, I am not suggesting that at all. 
But my predecessor, Chair Clayton, finalized 64 rules, our 
docket is looking to do 50 to 55. We have finalized about 19; 
we have about 35 proposals outstanding right now, and so we are 
in that same zone. Two, in terms--now, there might be different 
types of rules----
    Senator Manchin. And so I just think it is the same period, 
right?
    Chairman Gensler [continuing]. Yes, over a 4-year term. We 
may have gone a little bit sooner in the 4-year period, but the 
whole docket is about----
    Senator Manchin. But his was--if I am understanding, his 
was a 60- 90-day, you know, comment period.
    Chairman Gensler. So in terms of the comment periods, our 
average period from the time we voted and put it on our website 
to literally the close of the comment period has been, I think, 
74 days. Now, what we do is, because there is a period of time 
before it gets in the Federal Register, we generally put things 
out, we say it will be no less than 60 days from the time we 
vote, or later if it takes long to get in this Federal 
Register.
    Senator Manchin. Okay.
    Chairman Gensler. But for instance, in some really, you 
know, important rules around equity markets, we put that out 
for 105 days. The climate rules that you mentioned were out, 
though I don't have the notes here, well in the high double-
digits days. We have also reopened between a dozen and twenty 
rules where we get further comments.
    And as I say, because it tends to take between a year and 
20 months to finalize, we continue to take meetings, we 
continue to take input, because these are important matters, as 
you say.
    Senator Manchin. Thank you, sir.
    Senator Durbin. Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chairman Gensler, I would first like to just start out by 
commenting on the fact that yesterday, the SEC refrained from 
inserting itself into an ongoing court case regarding the 
determination of syndicated loans as securities. And as you 
know, this is a well-functioning market, it has got 
sophisticated market participants, and I was glad to see the 
Commission resists to adding any uncertainty into such an 
important part of our credit markets.
    I would like to turn now to the SEC and its agenda. As I 
mentioned in my opening statement, many of the rules 
promulgated under your tenure have crept well beyond the SEC 
statutory mandate. And we are not talking about just a few 
rules; it is an eye-watering number. You just talked with 
Senator Manchin about the number of rules that you have 
undertaken so far, and you have pointed back to the fact that 
this is in line with what your predecessors have done.
    But I would look back at the last 27 months of your two 
predecessors and the pace that you have undertaken here. And 
during the 27 months that you have been Chairman of the SEC you 
issued--you have issued 58 rule proposals. That is nearly equal 
to the proposals by both Chairs Clayton and White combined 
during their first 27 months.
    The sheer volume of this isn't the only problem, though. 
And again, you touched on this with Senator Manchin, the speed 
with which these new rules are developed and imposed on the 
market is just as important. And here again, it feels that you 
are moving at an extremely rapid pace.
    This raises an obvious question then, how does the volume 
and speed of rulemaking impact the quality of these rules? 
Well, here are just a few issues that were raised by SEC 
managerial employees that came directly from the Inspector 
General Report that was conducted last October--that was 
printed last October.
    And I will run through a few of them, and these are direct 
quotes. ``Shortened timelines during the drafting process; 
limited time available for staff research and analysis, limited 
feedback during the rulemaking process, shortened public 
comment periods, increased litigation risk, difficulties 
managing resources, and other mission-related work.'' These are 
direct quotes from that OIG Report.
    So my first question is, do you agree with the statements 
of the SEC Managerial Staff that were in this report that 
state, quote, ``The more aggressive agenda, particularly as it 
relates to high-profile rules that significantly impact 
external stakeholders, potentially; one, limits the time 
available for staff research and analysis; and two, increases 
litigation risk''?
    Chairman Gensler. Again, I am very proud to be part of such 
a dedicated staff. And I think they are doing excellent work. 
It is what we benefit from when we put these proposals out to 
public comment, and we hear back, whether they see something 
that we didn't get accurate in the economic analysis, the legal 
analysis, the policies.
    In terms of the staff, I am also pleased to say that we 
have, for a number of years been very--the survey is done by 
the Partnership for--the Partnership for Public Service that we 
tend to be very highly ranked by our own staff about the work 
at the staff. But in terms of the rules----
    Senator Hagerty. I am talking specifically about the OIG 
Report, and here, what they are citing is not a process 
substance that you are talking about. It is talking about 
concerns with the process itself. Again, the speed and the 
volume that you are moving forward on; and here, it seems to me 
that it is a recipe for disaster moving at this pace, at this 
volume, particularly when you hear these types of complaints 
coming back from the staff. And the real victims here are the 
Americans whose livelihoods depend on returns from the 
marketplace.
    Chairman Gensler. You know, I appreciate that, but it is 
also we put out to public comment. We have a rule docket that 
is these 50 to 55, or so, and that is, we have been candid with 
the public through the administrative process about that is our 
docket, these 50 to 55 proposals, and we get the comments back, 
and we adjust. I mean, the final proposals--I mean, the final 
adoptions reflect a lot of the comments that we have received.
    Senator Hagerty. If I could come back again where I started 
here, in terms of the tendency to exceed the mandate of the 
SEC. The regulatory agenda that you have laid out, the 
increased budget requests that you have laid out raises 
complicated but particularly germane questions. Like, how much 
funding would the SEC need if it weren't trying to do the job 
of the Congress, the EPA, the banking agencies, if it weren't 
bringing enforcement actions that are likely to be lost?
    Rather than struggle for the answer here, let us--we will 
get through that, so the question is for the record, but that 
is a very obvious question. I mean, if you look beyond the 
mandate activities, we are funding those.
    What I do want to ask you is this: Do you keep a tally of 
the cost of lost cases, when you bring enforcement action and 
lose? Have you kept track of the expenditures, the cost of 
that, both to the SEC and to those who have to defend against 
them?
    Chairman Gensler. We bring a--we either settle or bring 
between 7- and 800 actions a year, and that is being a cop on 
the beat, and we lose very few, Senator, but we are going to it 
from time to time. That is the nature of our processes. So too 
would any law enforcement, we are a civil law enforcement 
agency. But it is really to protect the investing public, and 
protect those firms that are trying to access the capital 
markets. And so we bring cases, whether it is Ponzi schemes, or 
pump and dump schemes, or accounting fraud, insider trading, 
and----
    Senator Hagerty. I am talking about the statement cases, 
the cases that are meant for messaging. That is my great 
concern. And I don't think it is right to put American 
taxpayers on the hook for defending themselves in these cases 
when you know that there is a high odd--high odds of losing. 
That is the point here.
    Chairman Gensler. To say----
    Senator Hagerty. And I will come back with questions for 
the record. We are out of time on this round. But I will come 
back with questions for the record to try to get at this cost.
    Chairman Gensler. If I might just say, we only bring a case 
if we think that it is--the facts and the law dictate it, and 
it is really within the facts. We take it, our five-member 
Commission votes on every one of these. We end up voting 
between 15 and 30 of these a week, and we take this very 
seriously. We don't, we don't bring cases if we don't think 
there has been real wrongdoing.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you.
    Senator Van Hollen. Senator Durbin.
    Senator Durbin. Thank you, Mr. Gensler, Chair Gensler, for 
being here. What percentage of Americans--are in the stock 
market?
    Chairman Gensler. Well, it is--there is at least 52 million 
Americans that have investment advisors advising them. There is 
even more than that number, and I will have to get back to you, 
that actually invest in mutual funds or have brokerage 
accounts, but it is--it is well over half, but we will get you 
the exact statistic.
    Senator Durbin. I have heard it was around half, if you 
could give me some specifics, it is helpful. The thing that 
surprises me, when I read and learned that one out of five 
Americans invested or traded cryptocurrency; are you aware of 
that?
    Chairman Gensler. I have seen some of those statistics.
    Senator Durbin. One out of five.
    Chairman Gensler. Again, I can't vouch for the surveys. It 
is not done by the SEC, or this Committee.
    Senator Durbin. So this is an industry which you have said 
is, quote, ``Rife with fraud, scams, and abuse.'' Did you say 
that recently?
    Chairman Gensler. I would say it in this live hearing; it 
is a field that is rife with fraud, scams, and abuse, and there 
are a lot of actors in this field that are international, 
offshore, but they are still tapping on the American public's 
wish for a better future.
    Senator Durbin. According to one estimate in 2022 alone, 
fraud schemes involving cryptocurrency totaled more than $9 
billion. Does that surprise you?
    Senator Durbin. No. It could be larger, sir.
    Senator Durbin. I could go through the list of outrages 
involved in this industry. Celebrity endorsers, Matt Damon, 
noted financial advisor; Larry David, another financial advisor 
with trust implicitly; Tom Brady, who can't even get paid for 
doing the commercial; Kim Kardashian, and on and on. They spend 
billions on sports arena or stadium naming rights deals to gain 
misguided credibility with everyday Americans.
    They manipulated prices with phony tokens of no underlying 
value, fail to protect and segregate investor funds. This is 
happening over and over again. This doesn't sound like America. 
What is missing here?
    Chairman Gensler. Well, it is a real pattern. I mean, there 
is a technology underlying it, a ledger technology called 
blockchain technology. There may well be a particular value in 
some of these use cases, but the American public is not getting 
the proper disclosure to make their investment choices. And 
then the companies operating in this space, as you say, are 
bundling and co-mingling services that we would never allow.
    We would never allow the New York Stock Exchange to also 
trade against their customers. We just, we don't, we haven't 
for decades. And here, there is all this bundling and co-
mingling. And what is more, there is this tremendous amount of 
bad actors in the field as well, a lot of them offshore preying 
upon U.S. investors.
    Senator Durbin. And a lot of them are looking for a home in 
our political system, are they not?
    Chairman Gensler. That is not our jurisdiction, but I have 
read some of those articles.
    Senator Durbin. I went to a hearing like this, walked out 
in the hallway, the reporter said, ``How much money has your 
campaign fund taken from the cryptocurrency business sector? 
And I said, ``None. I have nothing to do with him.'' She said, 
``You are wrong. It is $20,000, and I can show you.'' I hadn't 
asked for it, didn't realize I had received it. But they are 
playing everywhere they can to buy influence in the process. 
What is the best way for us to protect American consumers from 
cryptocurrency in the future?
    Chairman Gensler. Well, I think that we have robust 
authorities at the SEC. I think our sibling agency still does--
I have said this often--the CFTC may need additional 
authorities, because some of these tokens are not under our 
jurisdiction. I think it is very few, but I am not trying to 
prejudge any one token. But our authorities at the SEC are 
quite robust. We could always use some more resources.
    Senator Durbin. That is a question I want to get to, 
because I am on the Agriculture Committee too, and there is an 
ongoing debate among some quarters as to whether the CFTC has 
any authority in this industry. Do you think they do?
    Chairman Gensler. Well, there are some tokens that--and 
Bitcoin, I will just stay with that, Bitcoin itself doesn't 
have the attributes of an investment contract under the 
Securities laws; but many tokens, without prejudging any one, 
have the attributes of an investment contract. Meaning there is 
a group of individuals that the public is investing based on 
anticipation of profits based on their efforts.
    But as it relates to this, the Bitcoin, as I understand it, 
under the Commodities and Exchange Act, there is anti-fraud and 
anti-manipulation, but they don't have what is called plenary 
rule-writing authority. But I am sure Chair Benham could better 
answer some of those questions.
    Senator Durbin. So when it comes to appropriated funds, do 
you have enough in the SEC, personnel, and resources to deal 
with the cryptocurrency business?
    Chairman Gensler. If this committee were to see fit, and 
want us to have more resources, we could use them. Part of this 
$73 million, I know, and I really do thank the committee to 
come, unanimously, to fund us. But that we were hoping to add 
another 170 people; some in disclosure review, some in 
examination, but certainly some of them in enforcement. And you 
know, that cuts back on our ability to do this.
    Senator Durbin. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator Durbin.
    Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Chairman, 
welcome.
    Chairman Gensler. It is always good to see you, Senator. I 
have enjoyed our times in our private talks, and in these 
hearing rooms.
    Senator Kennedy. The feeling is mutual. Mr. Chairman, why 
did you and the SEC allow the FTX fraud to happen?
    Chairman Gensler. The crypto field is often one that is co-
mingling and bundling services, as I said earlier, and often, 
also offshore; and it is rife with abuses and fraud, it also 
takes time to thoughtfully, and by the book, and by the law 
build investigations and bring actions. There is a public 
figure, on average about 23 months from start to either 
settlement or bringing an action at the SEC.
    We did bring actions over the course of the last 5 years on 
150 companies, or a----
    Senator Kennedy. But the cow was out the barn? I mean, 
here--I follow your remarks, Mr. Chairman, because I have great 
respect for you, and you have said repeatedly before FTX blew 
up that the SEC has the authority to regulate cryptocurrency.
    Now, here you have this company, FTX, run by a young man 
who has more zeal than wisdom. He prides himself looking like 
the fourth runner-up in a John Belushi look-alike contest. He 
prides himself on being under-dressed and over-haired, reeks 
with arrogance. You could have sent down one investigator from 
the FTC with an ego like Mr. Bankman-Fried, and Sumler, send 
someone down from the SEC, and let them just watch you for a 
day. And he probably would have welcomed you in.
    I mean, his dad is a chaired professor at Stanford Law 
School. Where was Stanford? But where was the--where was the 
SEC? I mean, this was an accident waiting to happen, and I 
don't understand where the SEC was.
    Chairman Gensler. So sir, I would say that the whole field 
has hurt more Americans than it should.
    Senator Kennedy. Yes, but I am talking about FTX. I mean, 
we look back at FTX. I mean, Senator Durbin made this point, 
and we have this elaborate, complex regulatory machinery, the 
SEC, which I support, which is supposed to guarantee 
transparency and combat fraud. And any fair-minded person has 
to look at FTX and Mr. Bankman-Fried and these kids, and go: 
What in God's--where were--where was everybody? Where was the 
SEC?
    Chairman Gensler. And I would say where we were is, my 
predecessor, and also under my honor to be Chair, we have 
brought 140 or 150 actions. There are 15 to 20,000 tokens, and 
there are dozens of----
    Senator Kennedy. Yes, but that was after the fact, Gary. I 
mean, here is this young man; he did everything but bomb Mount 
Rushmore. Weren't you all curious? Where is this guy getting 
this money?
    Chairman Gensler. I would say that in the summer of 2021, 
when we Wells noticed a very large crypto exchange in the U.S., 
they went on Twitter and said that we were sketchy. When we 
subpoenaed Do Kwon, and this is all public, so I can say it; 
when we subpoenaed--we gave him a subpoena; he fought us in the 
District Court, he fought us in the Appellate Court.
    Senator Kennedy. I know that. I know that. But I am not 
talking about how many lawyers can dance on the head of a pin. 
I am talking about why didn't you send somebody down? I 
guarantee you, with his ego, Mr. Bankman-Fried would have 
welcomed you. Okay. He probably would have asked you to bring a 
film crew.
    You just send an investigator down, spend a half a day with 
these young people, come back, and go get an injunction. Shut 
them down, until they can answer some very basic fundamental 
questions. Like, for example, were they co-mingling funds? Why 
didn't we do that? Why didn't you do that? That is what we pay 
you folks to do.
    Chairman Gensler. Again, I can't----
    Senator Kennedy. I mean, I get all the Wells letter and all 
that. We have got--we have got tens of thousands of people that 
lost a lot of money, and they look, they look at this young 
man, and they will go: How did the--how did the regulatory 
authorities allow this guy to function? I mean, your Secret 
Service name is Butthead. That is how bad he is. Where was the 
SEC?
    Chairman Gensler. And again, sir, I can't speak to one 
enforcement matter like that, but let me just broadly say this 
whole----
    Senator Kennedy. Well, it is a big one.
    Chairman Gensler. This whole field, the whole crypto field, 
is built on models that we wouldn't allow in traditional 
securities markets of co-mingling. The co-mingling that you are 
mentioning----
    Senator Kennedy. And why did you allow FTX?
    Chairman Gensler. And we have----
    Senator Kennedy. Why did you allow FTX?
    Chairman Gensler. We have vigorously--we investigate by the 
book. You, I am sure, and the American public, want us to 
follow the facts, follow the law, properly give people 
subpoenas, they get lawyered up, they give us replies, they do 
effectively burn clock, and on average it takes time----
    Senator Kennedy. You could have gotten an injunction half-
a-day.
    Senator Van Hollen. Senator?
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Coons.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Chairman Van Hollen; Ranking 
Member Hagerty, thank you.
    Chairman Gensler, as the questioning of my colleague 
indicates, there is widespread interest in and concern about 
not just the years of alleged fraud carried out by Mr. Bankman-
Fried at FTX, but concern about the whole sector, about the 
safety and security and transparency of crypto transactions. 
You have said the '33 Act and the work of the SEC is critical 
to providing protection for the half of all Americans who 
invest and who are at risk.
    I am glad, that on a bipartisan basis, this Committee is 
coming forward to support a level of staffing, and resources, 
and technology needed to deal with emerging challenges, like 
how to effectively regulate crypto. And your funding is deficit 
neutral. I mean, one of the great things about it is we are not 
expending more taxpayer dollars.
    Is there one critical area you would point to briefly where 
you think either staffing, technology, or resources are 
lacking, and you would urge us to prioritize investment beyond 
the agreement that is been reached by this subcommittee?
    Chairman Gensler. I thank you for that question. I think 
that our full funding request, which is about $70 million more 
than you were able to come together on, would provide about 170 
more people.
    Senator Coons. Yes.
    Chairman Gensler. And that is across our examination, our 
disclosure review, which is a really important piece where 
issuers need feedback and enforcement, but it is also 
technology. And a big piece of it is, at give or take $400 
million, we are really--most of that technology spend right now 
is about our Legacy systems and technologies changing so 
rapidly. And even just data storage costs a lot more, just 
sheer volume of data. I think that would help us be better----
    Senator Coons. That is my hope, it will be----
    Chairman Gensler [continuing]. Cops on the beat, and 
better--but just even be more responsive to market participants 
wanting to get their filings reviewed.
    Senator Coons. How many rule proposals do you currently 
have under development, and how many of them might be finalized 
later this year?
    Chairman Gensler. I believe sir that we have thirty-four--
or -five proposals that are already out public but not yet 
adopted, and we have maybe a handful, five, six that are still 
being considered to be proposed, but that is our whole docket. 
In terms of timing, it is really when the staff is ready; and 
the Commission is ready, but it will take more than through the 
end of this year.
    Senator Coons. I joined a dozen of my colleagues in sending 
a letter just encouraging you, given the suite of rules in 
proposal development, to just make sure you are providing 
sufficient time for notice and comment on the proposed rules. I 
don't believe we got an answer. What is your answer to concerns 
that the aggregate impacts on the market, of such a broad range 
of proposed rules, need to be taken into account?
    Chairman Gensler. Well, in each of these rules, we do take 
into consideration the economic analysis, and then sometimes 
there are some interactions, and we note those in those rules. 
But we benefit from the feedback, whether it is from large 
market participants, their trade associations, individual 
investors, and then we take that into consideration.
    And as I said earlier, on average, these rules from 
proposal to final, take a year to a-year-and-a-half, but the 
formal comment periods have been about two to two-and-a-half 
months from when we voted out, we put it on our website, we 
start getting feedback.
    We have also reopened our--more than a dozen, I think it is 
20 of them, to get additional comment, and sometimes we update 
economic analysis and put that further out, and where 
appropriate we make adjustments in the Final Rules.
    Senator Coons. I do think it is important to regulate in a 
wise, and transparent, measured way so that the regulations are 
both effective and sustain. A last question about a specific 
proposal, swing pricing as an option used by funds currently. 
How many funds have actually utilized swing pricing since it 
was authorized in 2016?
    Chairman Gensler. Sir, I would have to get back to you in 
detail, but I think very few. I mean it is--while it is 
voluntary, I am not sure, so this is on mutual funds for this, 
sir.
    Senator Coons. Yes. I would appreciate an answer back in 
terms of how you think the proposal for a hard close would 
impact the use of swing pricing, and whether or not this is 
going to have an undue market impact. It strikes me my--what I 
have heard is that it is a tool that is very rarely used. And 
so perhaps the analysis needs to----
    Chairman Gensler. No, no--that is correct. I don't know the 
exact number, but it has been very rarely used. It is open-end 
bond funds work for the American public, really in many ways it 
is a very good product, because you can get the benefit of low-
cost and diversification. In times of stress, there have been 
times, and we saw it in 2020, in times of stress where we rely, 
ultimately, on the Federal Reserve, the Fire Department, so to 
speak, to come in and support the markets. And so we are just--
we are trying to build a little greater resiliency into the 
markets in those times of stress.
    Senator Coons. Thank you. Thank you for your testimony. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator Coons.
    Senator Boozman.
    Senator Boozman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much; and 
thank you all for holding this really important hearing.
    It wasn't too long ago that I was chairing this Committee, 
and you were chairing the CFTC, and the one thing that I want 
to compliment you on is that you have always been good to come 
and testify, and are very approachable, so we appreciate that.
    Chairman Gensler. I thank you. And I want to compliment 
you. It has always been good to get on the phone, or come to 
your office, even if we might have differences of policy, but 
we always--I learn from it, and we try to narrow the 
differences.
    Senator Boozman. No, I appreciate that very much. One of 
the things that I have a lot of concerns about is the SEC's 
custody proposal. You know, it undermines CFTC customer 
protection rules, conflicts with global margin treatment, what 
happens in the derivatives and treasury markets, and adds 
complexity to institutional, investment advisors, and qualified 
custodians. Even worse, in response to questions from my staff, 
both CFTC and Treasury staff said the SEC did not coordinate 
with either agency, which is unacceptable.
    The impacts on the derivatives, commodities, and treasury 
markets could cause systemic harm, and I strongly urge you to 
withdraw the proposal or completely rework it. Now, it is 
difficult. The SEC is such an important entity, and yet it is 
hard for us to, you know, give you the means that you need when 
you come out with this kind of stuff. I don't know how to say 
that in a nice way, but again, you know, this is--this rule is 
not a good rule. It has the potential of creating a lot of 
problems; and then, also, not working with CFTC and Treasury, 
which it affects in a great way, could it affect in a great 
way.
    Chairman Gensler. If I might, just put it in context; we 
have had a custody rule, and this is about investment advisors 
holding assets for their customers, since the 1960s, but then 
the Bernie Madoff events happened. They were terrible, really. 
And Congress came together and put a provision in, that Reform 
Bill, Dodd-Frank, that specifically addressed that we, the SEC, 
would have not just new authorities but should address the 
safeguarding of all client assets.
    It was no longer just the securities and funds held, or on 
behalf of customers, but all client assets. That was in 2010, 
and here we are in 2023, 13 years later, and we hadn't taken it 
up. So it is one of the remaining, I would say we had about 8 
of these when I came on board, 8 of 54 things we are working on 
were left--still left over from Dodd-Frank.
    And we have got a lot of public feedback. It is important 
to take that feedback. We have met with the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission; we have met with the Futures Industry 
Association about some of their comments, and we are taking 
those into consideration.
    Senator Boozman. No, we appreciate it. But the reality is 
the markets have been very resilient, and again, we want to 
allow our farmers and others to manage risk, and our concern is 
this would blow up those markets, and the agency, again, you 
should consider, you know, making significant changes based on 
all the conversations that you have had.
    The Fed has recently warned of a potential credit crunch 
and further slowing of the economy, during the pandemic we saw 
lenders use a single-name CDS to hedge against credit 
drawdowns; however, many believe the SEC's Proposed Rule 10b-1 
would hurt liquidity, and cause lending pullbacks, which is 
exactly the Fed's concern. We are in a high rate environment, 
and the Fed is warning against credit pullbacks. Yet, the SEC 
proposals, such as Treasury market reform, applying Rule 15c2-
11 to fixed income, the dealer proposal in the Rule 10b-1 would 
all be major overhauls that could reduce access to credit.
    So I guess the question I would have, would you conduct a 
publicly available economic analysis of the cumulative effects 
of your SEC proposals on U.S. credit markets? And will you 
commit to coordinating with the Federal Reserve about the 
cumulative effects of SEC proposals on U.S. credit markets?
    Chairman Gensler. So thanks for the question. There are a 
number of proposals that you mentioned related to the U.S. 
Treasury market, so there were three or four of those that you 
mentioned, and we have been in consistent dialogue with the 
U.S. Treasury, the issuer of U.S. Treasuries, on behalf of us, 
the American public, and the Federal Reserve because they use 
Treasuries to conduct monetary policy, and the various rules. 
So we have been in very good, close discussions with them.
    Second, we do have economic analysis on--in each of those; 
one is a Treasury market clearing; one is about Treasury 
dealers, and each of those we have robust economic analysis but 
also have gotten feedback. What is the issue we are trying to 
deal with? We are trying to deal with resiliency in the 2020 
dash for cash, during the starting part of COVID, there were 
really significant issues in the U.S. Treasury market, than 
there were in the fall of 2019, and in part, what supported the 
Treasury market was the Federal Reserve buying a couple 
trillion dollars, give or take, of Treasuries.
    So it has really, it has been an effort to have a little 
greater resiliency and competitiveness in that market. We, the 
taxpayers, ultimately benefit from that.
    Senator Boozman. We appreciate it. Again, fragile economy; 
we just want to make sure that access to credit is not impaired 
even more. Very quickly, you know, you mentioned that you got 
feedback regarding Senator Coons' question about rushing rules, 
and so you know the feedback we are getting is from the IG, and 
they said, the IG report found that staff had limited time for, 
quote, ``Research and analysis'', end quote, meaning their 
economic analysis were rushed.
    So you know, we need to sort that out. And I know that you 
are working hard in that regard. You are trying to get a lot 
done, but that is the feedback that we are getting.
    Chairman Gensler. I thank you for that feedback, sir.
    Senator Boozman. Thank you.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator, Boozman. So here is 
how we are going to proceed. We are going to have one more 
round of questions for interested Members of the Committee. 
That is going to be 5-minute rounds.
    So Mr. Chairman, you have discussed in your appearances 
before the Banking and Housing Committee, my belief that 
investors and the public have a right to know when corporations 
are taking big risks through the use of offshore tax havens. 
Jurisdictions around the world, especially Australia and the 
European Union, are moving in this direction, giving their 
investors the information they need to assess the tasks risks 
of their portfolios, including offshore tax havens.
    I have introduced legislation, the Disclosure of Tax Havens 
and Offshoring Act. Right now, as you know, the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board is looking at this. I am going to 
submit some questions for the record on the subject for you to 
take a look at, so we can, hopefully, move forward.
    I do want to ask you a question about proxy advisors, and I 
clearly have a difference of opinion from my colleague, the 
Ranking Member, on this. But tell me where I am wrong in this 
logic.
    I am T. Rowe Price, or I am another company, I choose to 
hire, with my own money, proxy advisors to give me guidance and 
advice on how I should proceed on different proxy votes. I use 
the example of T. Rowe Price; they are a Maryland-based 
company, and they both provide advice and they also pay proxy 
advisors for advice in some cases.
    So it seems to me that for those of us who do believe in a 
market system, and for the ability of private parties to make 
choices of their own within the law, that trying, by Government 
Fiat to stop a private entity from hiring a proxy advisor to 
make recommendations on decisions, seems kind of a violation of 
market principles and freedom of choice. What do you think?
    Chairman Gensler. The investors in this case, in your 
hypothetical, T. Rowe Price, a Maryland firm, but it doesn't 
matter what State they are in, but that investor has, as an 
investment advisor, a fiduciary duty to their ultimate 
investors. And that fiduciary duty, they have to decide, as 
part of that fiduciary duty, how to vote on a board of 
directors, maybe on mergers, and maybe on other matters before 
them.
    It tends to come in a short season in the spring, and so 
there has developed, in the last 20 to 30 years, these outside 
advisory firms that--firms like you just mentioned, but other 
investment advisors turn to. But it is still, ultimately, in 
your hypothetical, T. Rowe Price's fiduciary obligation to 
decide whether they support or object to whatever the vote is.
    In terms of the rulemaking that we did, we had a number of 
people that came into us, it was early in my tenure, that said 
that they thought that we should take this up. And we took the 
time to put it out to notice and comment. We got comments back, 
and based upon the record and the Commission's consideration of 
it, we have finalized some changes as our predecessor had made 
other changes.
    Senator Van Hollen. Right. But don't you think that any 
company should be able to, with their own money, pay somebody 
for proxy advice which they can take or leave without anyone 
trying to pass a law or regulation to prevent them from using 
their own money in that way?
    Chairman Gensler. Yes, I would broaden it; investment 
advisors, small and large, use outsourcing. They hire others 
for their technology, they hire others for pricing services, 
they hire others for proxy advice. I mean, there is dozens and 
dozens of things that they use outside advisors and we, we are 
neutral to that. We allow that.
    They still retain their fiduciary obligations and all of 
their other obligations that an investment advisor is 
safeguarding the assets that we were talking about earlier.
    But the use of outsourcing is a robust part of our economy, 
not just for investment advisors, and at least at the SEC, 
there is no--and that has facilitated--it promotes efficiency.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Haggerty.
    Senator Hagerty. If the Chairman might accommodate me to go 
outside of the 5-minute limit for a minute because I would love 
to--this is a very healthy conversation and to share my 
perspective on it.
    One, my conversation with Chairman Gensler, really has to 
do with transparency and disclosure regarding the advisory 
firms, not whether or not you can hire them, but transparency 
in terms of what these firms do; these firms not only work for 
the T. Rowe Prices, in your example, they also can work for 
activist investors, and they can be deployed to go out and put 
proposals in place that suit the desires of those activist 
investors.
    In fact, activists are in the ownership structure of these 
offshore firms. It is a duopoly. Two firms they say control 97 
percent of the proxy advisory services. I don't know who the 
other 3 percent are controlled by, but these two large firms.
    In my own private sector experience, I have dealt with 
these firms. As a member of the New York Stock Exchange traded 
company, experienced a proposal against, recommending against 
management, and what happens next is a phone call comes to 
management saying that our consulting arm--I am sure there is a 
Chinese wall there--but our consulting arm will help you get to 
a better answer.
    And after paying hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions 
of dollars in consulting fees, you can get the proposal 
recommendation for management as opposed to when it was against 
it. And as I mentioned, there are even circumstances where 
these firms are recommending four actions; that if management 
were to take them, would cause them to violate State or Federal 
laws.
    So there is a real problem. I think this goes back to our 
whole discussion about the volume of rules coming down the pike 
and trying to deal with the proposals that are now so easy to 
issue.
    As I mentioned earlier, the Harvard Law School Study 
indicated that there are five individuals that are launching 
over 40 percent of all these proposals. They are easy to do, 
and they are just inundating companies with this. And I think 
there needs to be--I think we should take a hard look at how 
these proxy proposals are put forward too. This is outside the 
realm of the advisors, but boy, they generate a lot of business 
for the advisors.
    Thanks for that diversion, but I think that is a healthy, a 
healthy conversation for all of us to have. And that is where 
my concern lies.
    To come back to some questions I wanted to discuss with 
you, Chairman Gensler, I would like to come back to crypto and 
the blockchain technology markets for a moment. In your 
conversations with Senator Durbin, you talked about a robust, a 
robust set of rules that you have--a robust set of tools, I 
should say, that you have to deal with this. What I have seen 
happen, just this year alone, is that U.S. share of stablecoin 
volume has gone down. U.S. blockchain developers' jobs have 
decreased here in America, and I think what is happening is 
that industry players are migrating overseas to other 
jurisdictions where the rules of the road are clearer for them.
    And when you think about the rules of the road here in 
America, the rule set is anything but clear. And what is 
occurring here, much more often than not, is regulation by 
enforcement, if you will. And I think that is creating a great 
deal of uncertainty in the market.
    What worries me is that we are losing out on technology 
development and innovation that I would like to see happening 
here, and I think it might make your job more challenging, as I 
think about your conversation with Senator Kennedy, because the 
company he is concerned about, FTX, is a Bahamian company. It 
is not an American company. And these companies like FTX are 
searching for jurisdictions that probably allow them to do what 
they want to do.
    The question I raise is if we had a robust rule set here, 
would we have the ability to attract the licit actors to 
operate here in the United States of America? And is there a 
way to put clarity? I mean, I would be interested in your 
concerns on that, yes.
    Chairman Gensler. So I actually think there are robust rule 
sets at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and it is 
outside of my--our jurisdiction, but over at the Treasury 
Department, and anti-money laundering, and financial crimes, 
enforcement network, and so forth.
    Senator Hagerty. Yet these firms are moving offshore.
    Chairman Gensler. Yes, because this is a field that, in 
part, is built on a business model of, catch us if you can. It 
is built in part, not everybody, but in part on a model of 
preying upon the investing public's desire for a better life 
and future, and the hype around these tokens, these 15- or 
20,000 tokens.
    And like most of venture capital, and I know, Senator, I 
respect you were in the venture capital field, most venture 
capital investments fail, just statistically, to many of these 
tokens, you know, if you think of them like startups, are 
likely to fail. And yet, they are not making full, fair, and 
truthful disclosures to the investing public. And you are 
absolutely right. There is a bit of regulatory arbitrage. I 
will set up in Malta. I will set up in the Bahamas. I will set 
up in, you know, some tax haven or offshore where they don't 
have the robust rules of the road that we have in our 
securities markets or the robust enforcement we might have 
around anti-money laundering.
    Senator Hagerty. To come back to, to the timing here, 
because I just a couple more questions to, to touch on, and we 
are running short. I would just strongly encourage, rather than 
regulating via enforcement, to think through the rule set that 
would create clarity in the marketplace. Because when I talk to 
market participants, they tell me that there is a lack of 
clarity here. And that is a, I think, a laudable goal to 
achieve.
    I have got a couple of other quick points. One of them goes 
back to what Senator Coons touched on in terms of not getting a 
response back, what I mentioned myself in terms of not getting 
responses back, fulsome responses back from the SEC when we 
send questions in. And this comes back to specifically two 
letters that you received from House Committee Chairman 
McHenry, Jordan, and Comer; Chairs McHenry, Jordan, Comer, 
asking about providing specific certifications regarding any 
use by you, or your direct reports, or personnel there at the 
SEC using their own personal, either off-channel or all-
platform methods, to communicate or conduct SEC business.
    I am talking about personal phones, using Signal, WhatsApp, 
those types of communications. In your written response to the 
first letter, you talk about the operation, you mentioned a 
number of areas, but you don't specifically respond directly to 
the five clear requests that were made in the SEC off-platform 
letter that came forward. And it includes providing specific 
certifications regarding the SEC's, and your personal 
compliance with Federal record-keeping requirements.
    So I think those requests are straightforward. I think it 
would be appropriate to address those, and I would just ask you 
now if you; have, you yourself, been involved in using your 
personal device, or off-platform devices for SEC business?
    Chairman Gensler. I have disclosed here; I think Senator 
Van Hollen still might call me on my cell phone. I have known 
him for 23 years, but when I get----
    Senator Hagerty. I am talking about the concern that was 
raised by----
    Chairman Gensler. No. I don't use. I occasionally--it is 
very rare these days, but I occasionally get an email from 
somebody, and then I just forward it over to the SEC.
    Senator Hagerty. I would just encourage you to please 
respond to these questions again. I have expressed the same 
frustration that my colleagues do in that regard. I think a 
response would be warranted there.
    One last area I will touch on, and I will deal with the 
rest of this to questions for the record; when you were 
speaking with Senator Collins about work from home, when you 
and I talked about this yesterday, it raises the question of 
what the impact might be on your office footprint.
    And there has been news, a lot of news related to the GSA 
announcement on your new headquarters' lease. I have seen 
different estimates for the cost of that lease to the taxpayer. 
But what would you expect over the next--do you have an 
estimate of what the next 25 years that building cost would be?
    Chairman Gensler. I think we need to get back to you, but I 
would say this, that our needed footprint has come down from 
when that was initially put out for a request for quote, now I 
think it was 4 years ago; it was pre-COVID, and so we----
    Senator Hagerty. At least we are trying to do it after 
COVID----
    Chairman Gensler [continuing]. We have actually worked with 
the General Service Administration and said, and we were--we 
had a right, under our agreement with GSA, we had a right to 
downsize with them, and we did about a year ago downsize with 
GSA. But we would have to get back to you on this specific 
question about----
    Senator Hagerty. Yes, and just, again, just thinking about 
the expense of these buildings, and as you described, a very 
different sort of work pattern. I would think that would have 
an implication on this.
    Chairman Gensler. We are actually looking at it across all 
12 of our offices, and where we can, to prudently and 
thoughtfully, shed space.
    Senator Hagerty. Well what; if I could work with you--if 
your staff could work with mine to just get us any sort of 
internal analysis that you have done, any fair pricing analysis 
that you have done, I would very much appreciate that.
    Chairman Gensler. I will ask staff to coordinate with 
yours, and some of this information is over at GSA, and not 
ours, but okay.
    Senator Hagerty. Okay. Thanks for coordinating with us on 
that. And I will submit the rest of my questions for the 
record. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator Hagerty. Thank you, 
Chairman Gensler, for being before the subcommittee. We look 
forward to continuing to be in touch on issues that were raised 
today.
