                        Thursday, March 14, 2024

                                       U.S. Senate,
       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:03 a.m., in 
room 430, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Bernard Sanders, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

    Present: Senators Sanders [presiding], Casey, Murphy, 
Hickenlooper, Cassidy, and Braun.

                  OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SANDERS

    The Chair. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions will come to order. This has been a 
shortened week, so I think you are going to see--there are 
hearings taking place all over the place and I think you are 
going to see Senators drifting in and out. But I want to thank 
all of our panelists for being with us.

    This morning, we are going to be talking about an issue 
that is very rarely discussed in the halls of Congress or the 
Senate, and that is the need to reduce the standard work week 
in the United States. In fact, the last time, as we understand 
it, the Senate held a hearing on this subject was in the year 
1955.

    I think maybe the time is now to renew that discussion. At 
that hearing, the Senate heard from Walter Reuther, who was 
the--at that point, the head of the United Auto Workers and the 
Congress of Industrial Organizations, and Reuther is regarded 
as one of the great labor leaders of his time.

    This is what Walter Reuther said at that time. He said, 
``We fully realize that the potential benefits of automation 
are great, if properly handled. If only a fraction of what 
technologists promised for the future is true, within a very 
few years automation can and should make possible a 4-day work 
week.

    The reduction of the work week to 35 or 30 hours in the 
coming decade can be an important shock absorber during the 
transition to the widespread use of automation. It can both 
reduce the impact of sharp rises in output and increase the 
manpower requirements in industry and commerce.''

    Yet today, nearly 70 years later, despite an explosion, as 
we all know, in technology and a massive increase in worker 
productivity, nothing has changed. Think about that. Think of 
the huge transitions we have seen in the economy, but in terms 
of the work week, nothing has changed.

    While we have not discussed this issue for a long time in 
Congress, this is not, needless to say, a new issue. In 1886, 
one of the central planks of the trade union movement in 
America was to establish an 8-hour workday with a simple and 
straightforward demand, ``Eight hours for work, 8 hours for 
rest, 8 hours for what you will.''

    That was back in 1886. Americans of that era were sick and 
tired of working 12-hour days for 6 or 7 days a week with very 
little time for rest, relaxation, or quality time with their 
families. They went out on strike. They organized. They 
petitioned the Government and business owners, and they 
achieved real results after decades of struggle.

    In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed legislation into 
law to establish an 8-hour workday for railroad workers. Six 
years later, the Ford Motor Company became one of the first 
major employers in America to establish a 5-day work week for 
auto workers. And here is something I believe that most people 
in our Country do not know.

    In 1933, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation 
to establish a 30-hour work week by a vote of 53 to 30. That 
was 1933. While that legislation ultimately failed as a result 
of intense opposition from corporate America, a few years 
later, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Fair 
Labor Standards Act into law, and a 40-hour workweek was 
established in 1940. My friends. In 1940.

    Unbelievably, 84 years later, despite massive growth in 
technology and worker productivity, millions of workers in our 
Country are working longer hours for lower wages. And I hope 
people hear this because it is not an issue we talk about 
enough.

    Today in America, 28.5 million Americans, 18 percent of our 
workforce, now work over 60 hours a week and 40 percent of 
employees in America now work at least 50 hours a week. We were 
talking about a 40-hour work week 80 years ago and that is what 
people today, despite the explosion of technology, are working.

    The sad reality is Americans now work more hours than the 
people of any other wealthy nation, and we are going to talk 
about what that means to the lives of ordinary people. In 2022, 
employees in the United States, and I hope people hear this, 
logged 204 more hours a year than employees in Japan.

    They are hardworking people in Japan. 279 more hours than 
people in--workers in the United Kingdom, and 470 more hours 
than workers in Germany. Despite these long hours, the average 
worker in America makes almost $50 a week less than he or she 
did 50 years ago after adjusting for inflation.

    Now let that sink in for a moment. Think about all of the 
extraordinary changes in technology that we have seen over the 
last 50 years, computers, robotics, artificial intelligence, 
and the huge increase in worker productivity that has been 
achieved during that time. In factories and warehouses, robots 
and sophisticated machinery did not exist then, or were only 
used in primitive forms. In grocery stores and shops of all 
kinds.

    There were no checkout counters that utilized barcodes. As 
a result of the extraordinary technological transformations 
that we have seen in recent years, American workers are now 
over 400 percent more productive than they were in the 1940's.

    Extraordinary. Technology has made working people far more 
productive. And what has been the result of all of that 
productivity increase for working people? Almost all of the 
economic gains of that technological transformation have gone 
straight to the top while wages for workers have remained 
stagnant, or even worse.

    While CEOs today are making 350 times as much as their 
average employees, workers throughout the country are seeing 
their family life fall apart as they are forced to spend more 
and more time at work.

    They are missing their kids birthday parties, Little League 
baseball games, and just the time they need with their family. 
And what stresses them out even further is that after spending 
all of this time at work, many of them still are living 
paycheck to paycheck, can't take care of their basic needs.

    At a moment in history when artificial intelligence and 
robotics--and I hope we all understand that the jobs that 
people have today ain't gonna be there in many cases in 15 
years. Our economy is going to be transformed through 
artificial intelligence and robotics.

    The question that we are asking today is a pretty simple 
question--do we continue the trend that technology only 
benefits the people on top, or do we demand that these 
transformational changes benefit working people, and one of the 
benefits must be a lower work week, a 32-hour work week.

    This is not a radical idea. France, the seventh largest 
economy in the world, has a 35-hour work week and is 
considering a 32-hour work week. Norway and Denmark is about--
their workweek is about 37 hours, and Belgium has already 
adopted a 4-day work week.

    What we are going to hear today is there are companies all 
over our Country and all over the world that have adopted the 
40-hour work week, and you know what they found? They found 
that productivity actually went up because workers were able to 
focus on their work.

    They were not exhausted, they were happy to go to work. So, 
the issue that we are talking about today is of enormous 
importance. Who benefits from the exploding technology, the 
wealthiest people who are doing phenomenally well or working 
people who are falling behind? And with that, let me give the 
mic over to Senator Cassidy.

                  OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CASSIDY

    Senator Cassidy. Thank you, Chair Sanders--thank you, Chair 
Sanders. The 32 hour work week with no loss in pay, my staff 
has volunteered to be the test case for that. I mean, like, who 
wouldn't want it? It is free money, if you will. No loss in 
pay, but you work a lot less. But in reality, there is no free 
lunch.

    Workers would be the ones who would pay, not get paid 
extra. The Government mandating a 32 hour work week requiring 
businesses to increase pay at least an extra 25 percent per 
hour would frankly destroy some employers.

    They would ship those jobs overseas, or they would automate 
to replace those workers for whom they have an increased 
expense, or they would dramatically increase prices to make 
this stay afloat. Now, we have talked about the Biden economics 
leading to inflation. This would be napalm upon the fire of 
inflation.

    If this policy is implemented, it would threaten millions 
of small businesses operating on a razor thin margin because 
they are unable to find enough workers. Now, they have got the 
same workers, but only for three quarters of the time, and they 
have to hire more.

    In fact, there is even an incentive for them to dip down, 
so they make everybody part time and then they don't have to 
pay certain benefits which are required--or certain 
requirements which are required for full time.

    Now, if a business wants to voluntarily try a 32 hour 
workweek for themselves, Federal law allows it. We don't have 
to mandate it. And we will hear from a business today that does 
that. So, if an employer thinks it is good for their business, 
makes them more competitive, go for it. We think that is a good 
thing.

    But by the way, I will note that the Chair has not done 
that with his staff. Why? Because there is a certain amount of 
work required for the continuity of the work. That is just 
basic. Now, if a business needs to maintain a 40-hour workweek 
to remain competitive, not just locally, but globally, a 
Government mandated 32-hour workweek would be catastrophic.

    Government should not be in the business of undermining an 
employer's ability to keep their doors open with unreasonable 
and perhaps unconstitutional mandates. Now, the Chair 
frequently says the United States is the wealthiest nation in 
the world. We are. How did we achieve it?

    American work ethic. Second to none. And we have a balance. 
We don't have people as they do in China working 80 hours a 
week, but we have that balance. This disrupts that balance. And 
we won't maintain the status of being the world's wealthiest 
nation if we kneecap the American economy with something which 
purports to be good for the American worker, but indeed will 
lead to offshoring of jobs seeking for a lower cost labor 
force.

    Now, there is a reason that no other country has a 
mandatory 32 hour workweek. When Japan shortened its workweek 
from 46 to 30 hours between 1988 and 1996, economic output 
plummeted 20 percent. Belgium, as the Chair notes, has a 4-day 
workweek, but those workers work 40 hours within those 4 days.

    Now, AI and other technologies have the potential to 
dramatically increase economic productivity. I think we should 
have a bipartisan hearing on the potential impact of AI on the 
American economy. If we have this, my gosh, I am ecstatic. And 
I see one of--Dr. Schor, you are nodding your head yes. We are 
simpatico on this. We need to explore it.

    My office published a white paper in an RFI to stakeholders 
last year on how this Committee should approach AI and the 
impacts upon health, education, and labor, and we are working 
on next steps based upon that feedback.

    But a mom and pop restaurant is not really seeing increased 
productivity from AI. They are having trouble finding enough 
people to fill shifts. And if we require them to pay for a 40 
hour work week for 32 hours of work, how will it turn out for 
that mom and pop restaurant? Hospital staffing shortages, we 
have talked about that, threatening public health.

    Well, why are we passing a law to exacerbate that shortage? 
UAW pushed for a 32 hour workweek. It didn't happen. But now I 
don't think the Federal Government should mandate it, frankly, 
just to kind of placate a Democratic political base. Frankly, 
this seems an exercise to try and help the UAW lay the 
groundwork for future negotiations. And if the UAW wishes to 
discuss this, we should do so--they should do so at the 
bargaining table.

    Now, by the way, I apologize if this hearing gives anyone 
false hope, but a mandatory 32 hour workweek is bad policy. I 
will note not even Democrats unanimously support this, but it 
may give us an understanding where the Biden administration is 
heading.

    They are up for tough reelection, and they may be more than 
willing to use Executive authority to do something which does 
not--which actually has bipartisan opposition. And there has 
been a concerning pattern from Democrats prioritizing policies 
to help politically connected unions at the expense of the 
workers and businesses--the workers and the businesses 
themselves.

    Recently, the Biden administration proposed a new overtime 
rule, dramatically increasing overtime pay threshold by 55 
percent. That will result in layoffs, and it will result in 
more inflation.

    The Biden administration released a new joint employer 
rule, threatening the viability of the franchise model that 
employs over 9 million workers and has empowered people who had 
a dream of becoming a small businessperson to become a small 
businessperson and otherwise would not have.

    The Department of Labor's new Independent Contractor Rule 
jeopardizes the ability of 27 million Americans to work as 
independent contractors, with the flexibility to pick their own 
hours and work from multiple businesses, and this being 
attractive--but their independence and protection from forced 
unionization has made restricting this freedom a top priority 
for unions.

    The Administration's assault on workers flexibility and 
employers via rulemaking is unacceptable. These policies hurt 
the American worker and, by the way, contribute to inflation. 
As I said, I would have been excited to work with the Chair on 
a hearing to discuss the impact of AI and the new technologies 
in our jurisdiction.

    There is very strong bipartisan interest in examining this 
issue, but we are working instead upon a bill which will never 
pass Congress and will be detrimental for American workers. 
With that, I yield.

    The Chair. Thank you. We have a very knowledgeable panel, 
and we thank all five panelists for being with us today. We are 
going to begin with Shawn Fain. Mr. Fain is the International 
President of the United Automobile Workers.

    He is a 29-year member of the UAW and got his start with 
the union as an electrician at Chrysler Kokomo Casting Plant. 
Recently, he led the UAW in negotiating an historic contract 
which substantially raised wages and benefits for the workers 
of that union. Mr. Fain, thanks for being with us.

STATEMENT OF SHAWN FAIN, INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT, UAW, DETROIT, 
                               MI

    Mr. Fain. Thank you. Good morning and thank you, Chairman 
Sanders, Dr. Cassidy, and Members of the Committee. I am here 
to talk about one of the most important issues to any union 
leader and any working class person, any U.S. Senator, and any 
human being, and that is our time.

    As President of United Auto Workers, I represent 400,000 
working class people and 600,000 retirees, and I know when my 
members look back on their lives, they never say, I wish I 
would have worked more. When people reach the end of their 
lives, they never say, I wish I would have made more money.

    What they wish for is they wish they had more time. And 
that is what work does. Work, we are paid for our time, and 
when we work, we are sacrificing time with other people, with 
family, friends, and other things we wish to do.

    But time, just like every precious resource in our society, 
is not freely given to the working class. Since the Industrial 
Revolution, we have seen productivity in our society skyrocket 
with the advances with technology.

    One worker is now doing what 12 workers used to do. More 
profit is being squeezed out of every hour, every minute, and 
every second. There was a time when this phenomenon was 
supposed to lead to workers getting their time back, getting 
some of their lives back. Nearly 100 years ago, economist John 
Maynard Keynes spoke of the future of workers' time.

    His worry that--was with all the gains in productivity we 
wouldn't know what to do with ourselves. And he predicted a 15 
hour workweek, 100 years ago. In my own union, I go back into 
our archives, and I read about the fight for the 30 hour 
workweek, an idea that was alive and well with our union back 
in the 1930's and 40's.

    But today, deep in the 21st century, we find these ideas 
unimaginable. Instead, we find workers working longer hours. We 
have workers working 7 days a week, 12 hours a day. There are 
workers, not union--union or not, working multiple jobs, and 
they are living to work and are scraping to get by, and they 
are living paycheck to paycheck.

    We find workers today, later in their life, working deep 
into their 60's, 70's, and 80's because they can't afford to 
retire. And we find associated deaths of despair from addiction 
and suicide of people who don't feel a life of endless, 
hopeless work is a life worth living.

    We have workers who feel despair as a consequence of 
advances in technology. Workers have been sacrificed at the 
altar of greed and they have been stripped of their dignity. We 
have a mental health crisis. We talk about a lot in this 
country, but we never talk about the causes of that.

    There has been studies done, increases in stress from 
working 7 days a week, 12 hours a day. You are sacrificing 
family life, things you want to pursue. It causes an increase 
in cortisol levels, which lead to heart disease, cancer, 
strokes.

    But given all those facts, if someone is lucky enough to 
get to retire, typically when they have worked themselves to 
death their entire life, they face knee replacements, hip 
replacements, shoulder surgeries, and the rest of their lives 
figuring out how they are going to survive. So, it is sad to 
say that in 1933, the U.S. Senate passed legislation to 
establish a 30 hour workweek.

    But due to intense corporate opposition, that legislation 
failed. But in 1940, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed 
the Fair Labor Standards Act, establishing a 40-hour workweek. 
84 years ago, 84 years ago, the 40-hour week was established. 
And since then, we have had a 400 percent increase in 
productivity. But nothing has changed.

    We--that was why we had--our big three campaign. We had our 
stand up strike. We raised a flag for a 32 hour workweek. This 
isn't just a union issue. Contrary to what some people want to 
talk about, this is a working class issue. And that is why 75 
percent of Americans in our contract fight stood with us in 
that fight, because they are all living the same reality. Who 
is going to act?

    Who is going to act to fix this epidemic of lives dominated 
by work? Are the employers going to act? Will Congress act? How 
can working class people take back their lives and take back 
their time? And I know what people and many in this room will 
say. They will say, people just don't want to work or working 
class people are lazy. But the truth is, working class people 
aren't lazy, they are fed up.

    They are fed up with being left behind and stripped of 
dignity. As wealth inequality in this Nation, this world 
spirals out of control, they are fed up that in America, in 
America, three families have as much wealth as the bottom 50 
percent of citizens in this Nation. That is criminal. America 
is better than this.

    I want to close with this. I agree there is an epidemic in 
this country of people who don't want to work. People who can't 
be bothered to get up every day and contribute to our society, 
but instead want to freeload off the labor of others. But those 
aren't blue collar people. Those aren't working class people.

    It is a group of people who are never talked about for how 
little they actually work and produce, and how little they 
contribute to humanity. The people I am talking about are the 
Wall Street freeloaders, the masters of passive income. Those 
who profit off the labor of others, have all the time in the 
world.

    While those who make this country run, the people who build 
the products and contribute to labor, have less and less time 
for themselves, for their families, and for their lives. So, 
our union is going to continue to fight for the rights of 
working class people to take back their lives and take back 
their time, and we ask you to stand up with the American 
workers and support us in that mission. Thank you.

    [The prepared statement of Mr. Fain follows.]
                    prepared statement of shawn fain
    Good morning, Chairman Sanders, Dr. Cassidy, and Members of the 
Committee.

    I'm here to talk about one of the most important issues to any 
union leader, any working-class person, any U.S. Senator, any human 
being. Our time.

    As president of the United Auto Workers, I represent 400,000 
working class people across industries, and 600,000 retirees. And I 
know when my members look back on their lives, they never say ``I wish 
I had worked more.'' They never say, ``I wish I'd made more money.'' 
They say, ``I wish I had more time.''

    But time, like every precious resource in our society, is not given 
freely to the working class.

    Since the industrial revolution, we have seen the productivity of 
our society skyrocket.

    With the advance of technology, one worker can do what used to take 
dozens.

    More profit can be squeezed out of every hour, every minute, every 
second.

    There was a time when this phenomenon was supposed to lead to 
workers getting their time back.

    Nearly 100 years ago, the economist John Maynard Keynes spoke of 
the future of workers' time.

    His worry was that with all the gains in productivity, we wouldn't 
know what to do with ourselves. He predicted a 15-hour work week.

    In my own union, I go back into our archives and read of the fight 
for the 30-hour week, an idea that was alive and well for many decades.

    But deep into the 21st century, we find these ideas unimaginable.

    Instead, we find workers working longer hours.

    We find workers working deep into their 60's, 70's, even 80's.

    We find the associated deaths of despair from addiction and 
suicide, of people who don't feel a life of endless, hopeless work is a 
life worth living.

    In our Stand Up Strike last year, we raised the flag for a 32-hour 
work week.

    Countries across the world have it.

    We know with technology, we can do more with less. It is the mantra 
we hear from management every day, and yet it never benefits the 
worker.

    Who is going to act to fix this epidemic of lives dominated by 
work?

    Will the employers act?

    Will Congress act?

    How can working class people take back their lives, and take back 
their time?

    I know what people will say. Maybe even people in this room.

    They'll say: people just don't want to work. They'll say, working 
class people are lazy.

    I want to close with this.

    I agree there is an epidemic in this country of people who don't 
want to work.

    People who can't be bothered to get up every day and contribute to 
our society, but instead want to freeload off the labor of others.

    But those aren't the blue-collar people. Those aren't the working-
class people.

    It's a group of people who are never talked about for how little 
they actually work, and how little they actually contribute to 
humanity.

    The people I'm talking about are the Wall Street freeloaders, the 
masters of passive income.

    Those who profit off of the labor of others have all the time in 
the world.

    While those who make this country run, who build the products and 
contribute the labor, have less and less time for themselves, for their 
families, and for their lives.

    Our union will continue to fight for the rights of working-class 
people to take back their lives, and take back their time. We ask for 
your support in that fight.

Dr. Schor, thanks very much for being with us.

   STATEMENT OF JULIET SCHOR, PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY, BOSTON 
   COLLEGE AND LEAD RESEARCHER FOUR DAY WEEK GLOBAL TRIALS, 
                           NEWTON, MA

    Dr. Schor. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Sanders, Dr. 
Cassidy, and Members of the Committee. I am honored to have 
this opportunity to support the 32 Hour Workweek Act.

    We are here today because for 84 years, there has been no 
reduction in the standard workweek. Since 1950, the 
productivity of the American worker has risen by 400 percent. 
Yet full time employees still log an average of 41.9 hours a 
week. Annual hours even rose in the 1990's and have barely 
changed since then.

    These trends depart from the steady reduction in hours 
between 1870 and WWII, and from trends in other wealthy 
countries. The average American is on the job 400 more hours a 
year than in Germany, 200 more than in France, the Netherlands, 
the U.K., and more than the average Japanese.

    This is despite the U.S. historically being the global 
leader in work time reduction and the world's first 5 day week 
country. Now, this was the situation when the pandemic hit, 
which brought with it extraordinary levels of stress and 
burnout, the great resignation, and historically high job 
vacancies.

    In response, an increasing number of employers are shifting 
to a 4 day, 32 hour week with no reduction in pay. I was asked 
to lead research on their experiences in collaboration with an 
NGO called Four Day Week Global. To date, more than 300 
companies around the world have taken part in our trials.

    While the majority are white collar firms, they do include 
all sectors, health care, mom and pop restaurants, 
manufacturing, construction, retail, nonprofits, IT, finance, 
professional services, and even a police department in Golden, 
Colorado.

    In the U.S., 78 percent of these are small businesses with 
50 or fewer employees, which is similar to the U.S. economy. 
Our results have been extremely positive for both workers and 
the companies. We have 26 well-being measures for more than 
3600 employees, every one of which registers improvement from 
baseline to the end of the trial. Nearly 60 percent of 
employees experience better work family balance.

    Anxiety, sleep problems, fatigue, physical and mental 
health improve for 40 percent of workers. 69 percent of 
employees have lower burnout scores. Participants tell us that 
the new schedule is ``life changing.''

    One person reports that had it not been for the pilot, I 
wouldn't have had the time or the availability to get medical 
appointments and procedures, which ultimately led to the early 
detection of something that might have proved fatal.

    That something was cancer. In our statistical modeling, we 
find that the larger the work time reduction, the greater the 
increase in well-being. Fewer sleep problems and less fatigue 
are one reason, but the second is that a majority of employees 
register an increase in their productivity over the trial.

    They are more energized, focused, and capable, partly as a 
result of organization wide changes in work culture and 
processes. In response to methodological criticism, I will just 
say here that our findings are robust across time, across place 
and industry, and contain a large number of variables to rule 
out alternative explanations.

    For employers, the most important number is 91 percent. 
That is the fraction of companies who have continued with the 
4-day week after at least one full year. In the U.S. and 
Canada, only two companies have gone back to a 5-day schedule. 
Their performance metrics reveal why.

    Resignations fell 22 percent, absenteeism declined 39 
percent, revenue increased an average of 30 percent. Some 
companies report that quality of service improves. After losing 
50 percent of their in-patient nurse leaders during the first 
two pandemic years, Temple University Hospital gave them a 4-
day week. Patient outcomes improved and voluntary turnover fell 
to zero.

    If the U.S. adopts a 4-day week, a 32 hour week, it is 
likely that hourly productivity will rise. That has been the 
experience of both workers and management in our trials. It is 
historically what scholars have concluded from past reductions 
in work time, and it accords with international comparisons.

    The countries with the highest levels of per hour 
productivity are those with the shortest working hours. I began 
my remarks by referencing our fourfold increase in 
productivity. The fact that so little of that productivity 
increase has been put toward reducing hours has left American 
workers suffering from burnout and stress, with families in 
special jeopardy.

    The pandemic exacerbated this preexisting problem. Given 
the current robust rates of U.S. productivity growth, the 
promise of further large increases from artificial 
intelligence, and the fact that over the last 84 years the 
standard workweek has been unchanged, it is now time for a 32 
hour week. Thank you.

    Good morning Chairman Sanders, Dr. Cassidy and Members of the

two hour week.

    We are here today because since 1938, there has been no reduction 
in the standard workweek. And yet, since 1950, the productivity of the 
average American has risen by 400 percent. \1\ Although there has been 
a small average reduction in weekly hours since that time, full-time 
workers still log an average of 41.9 hours per week. \2\ On an annual 
basis, hours also remain high--they even rose in the 1990's, and have 
barely changed since then. \3\

1844 in 2000, 1734 in 2010 and 1774 in 2022.

    On a household basis, the time squeeze is especially acute. As 
increased numbers of mothers entered the paid labor force in the 
1970's, and men's hours did not fall to compensate, paid work effort 
soared in dual earner families, which are now the majority household 
type. Annual household hours for an average middle-class married couple 
with children rose to 3,446, or 600 more than in 1975. \4\

Class Time Squeeze,'' Brookings Institution. p 2. https://

    These trends are in contrast to the path of worktime reduction from 
1870 until WWII. In fact, the long working hours of the United States 
represent an exception--both to our own past and in comparison to other 
countries. The average American is on the job 400 more hours than in 
Germany; 200 more than in France, the Netherlands and the UK; and 50 
more than the average Japanese. \5\ This is despite the U.S. 
historically being the global leader in worktime reduction--and the 
world's first 5 day week country. In other high income nations, hours 
have fallen steadily, by just under a half a percent a year over the 
postwar period. \6\ Here, hours have been roughly stable on a 
population basis, and on a household basis, have risen considerably.

workers, as well as the Great Resignation, \7\ and historically high 
levels of unfilled positions. \8\ Gallup reports that the U.S. and

    As a result of these elevated levels of stress and burnout, as well 
as successful individual company experiences, an increasing number of 
employers have decided to trial a 4-day, 32-hour week, with no 
reduction in pay. I was asked to lead research on their experiences. 
Beginning in February 2022, in collaboration with an NGO called 4 Day 
Week Global, we began a series of 6 month trials of the 4-day week 
model. Since that time we have been enrolling additional companies. 
More than 200 have joined, plus another 100 are being followed by our 
collaborators in Portugal, Brazil and Germany. While the majority are 
white collar firms, we have participants across all sectors--including 
healthcare, restaurants, manufacturing and construction, retail, non-
profits, IT, finance, and professional services, the largest group. 
Participants span the globe--in addition to the U.S. and Canada, we 
have companies in Europe, Australasia, South Africa, and Brazil. We 
collect data from employees before they begin their new schedules, as 
well as at six, twelve, and twenty-four months into their 4 day weeks. 
We have also collected a small set of common metrics from the 
organizations. The results have been extremely positive, for both 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
workers and companies.

    First, the worker findings. We have twenty-six worker well-being 
measures for more than 3600 employees who have completed at least two 
surveys. On every metric, we find positive and statistically 
significant improvements with the shift from a five to a 4-day 
schedule. In our U.S. and Canada sample, 69 percent of employees have 
lower burnout scores and 41 percent have lower stress. More than 40 
percent report better physical and mental health. Two-thirds experience 
more positive emotions. Anxiety and fatigue decline for 40 percent. 
Nearly 60 percent score higher on questions about their ability to 
achieve work-family balance. Sleep problems diminish. Ninety-five 
percent of participants want to continue with this schedule. Findings 
are very similar for our global and our large UK samples.

    In survey comments and interviews, we hear that the new schedule is 
``life changing,'' ``the best thing that's ever happened to me,'' 
``transformational,'' and that the trial has ``improved my life in 
every possible way.'' Workers tell us about improvements in mental and 
physical health, ability to spend time with family, and finally getting 
a chance for time for themselves. We hear from people with disabilities 
who credit the 4-day week with their being able to stay in the labor 
force. One respondent reports that ``Had it not been for the pilot I 
wouldn't have had the time or the availability to get medical 
appointments and procedures which ultimately led to the early detection 
of something that might've proved fatal.'' That something was cancer.

    We also find that these results are durable--and not merely a 
response to a novel schedule. At 12 months there is no reversion to 
pre-trial levels, and for some measures, improvement continues.

    In our statistical modeling, we investigate what is driving these 
improvements in well-being. We find that it is reductions in hours 
worked. \10\ These vary across the sample, as not everyone actually 
reduces hours by the full eight per week. What we discovered is that 
the larger the working time reduction, the greater the well-being 
improvement. When we drill down farther, we find two main reasons for 
the association between worktime reduction and well-being. The first is 
reductions in sleep problems and fatigue. The second comes from a more 
surprising, but integral part of the approach, which is that the 4-day 
week results in large improvements in people's self-reported work 
ability. We find that 57 percent of employees experience an increase in 
their ``current work ability compared to their lifetime best.'' Self-
reported productivity also rises and 54 percent score higher on a 
``work smart'' scale. The ways in which companies and individuals 
prepare for the 4-day week leave people more in control of their 
workloads, more energized on the job, and more capable. It's central to 
why the model works, not just for employees, but for the organizations 
who implement it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\  Wen Fan, Juliet B. Schor, Orla Kelly and Guolin Gu, 2023, 
``Does work time reduction improve workers' well-being?: evidence from 
global 4-day workweek trials,'' https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/
7ucy9.

    Let me say a word about our research methods. To assess employee 
outcomes we use a within-subjects methodology, surveying employees 
before and after the 4-day schedule is introduced. This avoids the 
biases of retrospective and cross-sectional studies. While we do not 
have a perfect way to establish causality, the finding that larger 
reductions in hours yield more well-being improvement supports our 
interpretation. To mitigate ``confounders,'' i.e. unmeasured trends 
occurring simultaneously, we have adjusted for a wide range of socio-
demographic and socio-economic characteristics, as well as company 
characteristics such as industry and size, which barely change the 
findings. Our findings hold across various time periods, industries and 
nations, suggesting that our results are robust and likely generalize 
to different settings. In our ongoing trials we have added control 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
companies for comparison.

    Let me turn now to our company findings. The most important number 
here is 91 percent. That's the fraction of companies in our global 
sample of 202 who have continued with the 4-day week schedule after at 
least 1 year. Only 9 percent have gone back to a 5-day schedule. Among 
the 60 U.S. and Canadian companies, only two, a mere 3 percent, have 
reverted to 5 days.

    Company performance metrics also show success. Among the U.S./
Canada companies, the resignation rate fell 22.5 percent. Absenteeism 
declined 39 percent. The average revenue increase over the trial period 
has been 30 percent. We do not have a common productivity measure in 
large part because productivity is so difficult to measure in many 
white collar settings and because measurement varies across 
organizations. However, the companies rate the trial impact on 
productivity at 7.7 out of 10. They rate the trial overall at 8.6 out 
of 10. They rate the ability of the new schedule to attract employees 
at 8.8.

    Many observers are surprised by the fact that a reduction in hours 
with no decrease in pay can work for companies. One reason is that they 
are able to increase hourly productivity. The 4-day week global model 
involves 2 months of preparation in which companies figure out ways to 
improve efficiency. These vary by industry, but for many, streamlining 
meetings and reducing distractions are key. Because standard hours have 
been sticky at 40, companies become vulnerable to Parkinson's Law--work 
expands to fill the available time. Even as they have gained many time-
saving digital tools, if hours are not reduced, inefficiencies can 
creep in. This has been the case for many in the trials.

    A key finding of our research is that the productivity improvements 
companies report are not due to speed-up, but occur as a result of true 
enhancements to work process and culture. Our employee metrics for work 
intensity and the pace of work are mainly stable as measured before the 
trial and at 6 months. In contrast, workers' self-reports of 
productivity and work ability increase significantly.

    But success involves more than just increasing hourly productivity. 
Companies are also benefiting in other ways. For some of the 
organizations in our trials, the main benefit is reduced burnout among 
their employees, which in turn leads to improvements in employee 
retention.

    Less stressed, more committed workers may also lead to a higher 
quality of service or production. This is of particular concern among 
healthcare workers, and nurses in particular, who are the largest group 
of healthcare workers in the U.S.. The high rates of not just 
resignations, but nurses leaving the profession can be addressed with a 
4-day week. After experiencing a loss of 50 percent of their inpatient 
nurse leaders during the first two pandemic years, Temple University 
Hospital instituted a 4-day week for them. Voluntary turnover fell to 0 
percent and patient outcomes improved. \11\

nursingmanagement/citation/2023/10000/designing-structures-to-support-
a-4-day-workweek.5.aspx.

    In our trials, we see a statistically significant reduction in 
turnover intentions. Some companies report zero resignations after 
starting the new schedule. Similarly, they find large increases in 
their applicant pool when they can advertise a 4-day week. This is 
especially crucial at the current moment, when there are so many 
unfilled positions. \12\

    Our research involves companies who have voluntarily decided to 
shift to a 4-day week. It may be useful to note some of the features of 
these companies, to address potential concerns of an economy-wide shift 
to a 32-hour week. One concern is about small companies. We have a 
preponderance of small companies in our sample--in the U.S./Canada 
group, 78 percent of organizations have 50 or fewer employees. In part 
that is an artifact of the trials--large companies can do this on their 
own. However, employees at many small companies may be especially 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
suffering from burnout.

    A second issue relates to flexibility. Companies in these trials do 
not follow a one size fits all model. They are more like snowflakes--
every company does it differently. The ways in which they take time off 
vary, as they plan, experiment and figure out the best model for them. 
For example, only 60 percent have a Fridays off model.

    Finally, one of the reasons these organizations are succeeding is 
that the planning process involves productive collaboration between 
workers and management to figure out how to make the new schedule work. 
That collaboration is itself a benefit to the organization going 
forward.

    Governments around the world have become interested in the 4-day 
week. In Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Scotland, national governments 
have already sponsored trials. Interest is growing.

    If we adopt a 4-day week it is likely we will find that 
productivity growth not only makes worktime reduction possible, but 
that the relationship goes both ways. Hours reductions can raise hourly 
productivity. That has been the stated experience of both workers and 
management in our trials. It is historically what scholars have 
concluded from past reductions in worktime. \13\ And it accords with 
international comparisons--the countries with the highest levels of per 
hour productivity are those with the shortest worktime--Germany, 
France, Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark. \14\

    I began my remarks by referencing the four-fold increase in 
productivity that we have seen in the U.S. economy over the last 70 
years. The fact that so little of that productivity increase has been 
put toward reducing hours is in sharp contrast to the prior century. As 
a result, American workers have been suffering from burnout and stress, 
with families in special jeopardy. The pandemic exacerbated this pre-

both workers and companies.

    We have twenty-six well-being measures for more than 3600 
employees, every one of which registers improvement. In our U.S./Canada 
sample, 69 percent have lower burnout scores. Nearly 60 percent 
experience better work-family balance. Anxiety, sleep problems, 
fatigue, physical and mental health all improve for roughly 40 percent 
of workers. Participants tell us that the new schedule is ``life 
changing,'' and ``transformational.'' One person reports that ``Had it 
not been for the pilot I wouldn't have had the time or the availability 
to get medical appointments and procedures which ultimately led to the 
early detection of something that might've proved fatal.'' That 
something was cancer.

    For employers the most important number is 91 percent--the fraction 
of companies who have continued with the 4-day week after at least 1 
year. In the U.S./Canada group, only two companies have reverted to 5 
days. Performance metrics reveal why. On average, resignations fell 
22.5 percent. Absenteeism declined 39 percent. Revenue increased 30 
percent. After losing 50 percent of their inpatient nurse leaders 
during the first two pandemic years, Temple University Hospital gave 
them a 4-day week. Patient outcomes improved and voluntary turnover 
fell to 0.

    If the U.S. adopts a 4-day week it is likely that hourly 
productivity will rise. That has been the experience of workers and 
management in our trials. Similarly, nations with the highest levels of 
per hour productivity are those with the shortest hours--Germany, 
France, Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark. I began my remarks by 
referencing the fourfold increase in productivity that we have seen in 
the U.S. economy since 1950. The fact that so little of that 
productivity increase has been put toward reduced hours is in sharp 
contrast to the prior hundred years. As a result, American workers have 
been suffering from burnout and stress, with families in special 
jeopardy. The pandemic exacerbated this pre-existing problem. Given 
robust rates of U.S. productivity growth, the promise of further 
increases as a result of Artificial Intelligence, and the fact that 
over the last 85 years, the statutory workweek has been unchanged, I 
support the legislative effort to enact a 32 hour workweek.

    The Chair. Dr. Schor, thank you very, very much. Our next 
witness is Jon Leland, the Chief Strategy Officer at 
Kickstarter and Co-Founder of the nonprofit WorkFour. Mr. 
Leland successfully introduced 4-day workweek at his company in 
2022, and in his nonprofit work supports employers, unions, and 
policymakers advancing the 32-hour workweek. Mr. Leland, thanks 
for being with us.

 STATEMENT OF JON LELAND, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER, KICKSTARTER 
  AND COFOUNDER, WORKFOUR-THE NATIONAL CAMPAIGN FOR THE 4-DAY 
                     WORKWEEK, NEW YORK, NY

    Mr. Leland. Good morning, Chairman Sanders, Dr. Cassidy, 
and Members of the Committee. As the Chief Strategy Officer at 
Kickstarter, I bring a unique perspective to this panel, having 
both implemented and experienced a 4-day workweek in our 
company of 118 employees.

    Our journey began during the pandemic, a period that 
completely upended traditional work norms and demonstrated just 
how ingrained and potentially outdated some of our assumptions 
are around work.

    But the pandemic also clarified that the time we have with 
our families and loved ones is the most valuable thing that we 
have. Kickstarter is a data driven company and we were 
initially driven by repeated studies and success stories 
demonstrating that a 4-day workweek could benefit both 
businesses and employees.

    We also recognized some common sense around how a 4-day 
workweek could work. Hours worked is a factor in productivity, 
but it is not determinative. Efficiency, focus, and employee 
retention are all equally or more critical. And people are 
tired. Workers are already finding ways to rest at work. They 
are surfing the internet. They are just slowing down. They are 
stepping away just to get the energy to get through the 
workday.

    I would rather just give people back their time so they can 
properly rest. In April 2022, we initiated a 6-month pilot. Our 
goal was to maintain or improve overall productivity. And to do 
that, the bargain we made with our employees was simple.

    They would get back an extra day every week, retaining the 
same salary, the same benefits, and in exchange, we expected 
them to manage their time effectively, show up to work every 
week rested and ready to go, and get the job done.

    We were not going to scale back our ambitions or our goals 
to accommodate the 4-day workweek. And the results of our pilot 
were clear. Our goal achievement rate soared from 62 percent to 
95 percent. Customer response times and satisfaction ratings 
stayed the same. Employee retention increased from 82 percent 
to 98 percent, all while reducing average weekly working hours 
by 9 hours a week for each employee.

    We made the decision to stick with the 4-day workweek and 
have kept it for 2 years. The most profound change, however, 
has been the impact to our employees. In just 2 years, we have 
been able to return nearly 10,000 days to our 118 employees. 
That is more than 27 years.

    Those are our years of spending time with family and their 
children, volunteering in their communities, learning new 
skills, and taking care of their health. The value of that time 
is priceless and ultimately has been the greatest outcome of 
our transition to a 4-day workweek. The 5-day workweek is not 
an immutable law of nature. It was not written on the tablets. 
It was established 84 years ago here in the U.S..

    Critics of the 5-day workweek back then also predicted 
doom. They worried that a weekend would destroy the American 
economy. Instead, it helped launch us to the front of the 
global pack. Entire industries of recreation and leisure were 
born.

    The American middle class became the envy of the world, and 
the weekend became a time when families and communities came 
together, with a century of profound changes in our workforce 
and technology. With AI looming on the horizon, it is time for 
a much needed update.

    The studies echo what we learned at Kickstarter that when 
piloted, the 4-day workweek works. All 35 North American 
companies that piloted the 4-day workweek with us in 2022 have 
kept it. If it didn't work, for profit companies would abandon 
it. You don't need theories or advanced data, you just need to 
see that the companies that tend to pilot this tend to stick 
with it. This is not just tech companies either.

    These are manufacturing companies, health care facilities, 
restaurants, and police departments that are making this 
transition. This is a shift that can and must benefit all 
workers in our society. That is why the bill introduced by the 
Chairman is so important.

    It would ensure that we are defining a new standard for our 
workweek that benefits all workers in our economy, not just the 
most privileged. With the opportunity we have now, it is 
important to ensure that all American workers and our 
communities reap the dividends.

    The 4-day workweek is an issue backed by data that 
Americans of all stripes in poll after poll say matters to 
them. Before us is the opportunity to deliver a boost to our 
economy and happiness to every American worker, to strengthen 
American families and communities. The original weekend did 
just that, and it is time to do it again.

                              Introduction
    Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Members of the Senate 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I appreciate the 
opportunity to testify on the need to transition to a shorter workweek, 
with no loss in pay, for the benefit of our economy, society, and our 
people.

    My name is Jon Leland and I am the Chief Strategy Officer of 
Kickstarter, the largest crowdfunding platform for creative projects. 
We have 118 employees across the country and every year we help about 
20,000 entrepreneurs, creators and artists fundraise $700M to launch 
new businesses and projects. I am also the co-founder of WorkFour, the 
national campaign for the 4-day workweek. We are an entirely volunteer-
driven organization dedicated to supporting the transition to a shorter 
workweek for the benefit of all workers, businesses, and society.
    Data and Common Sense Led Kickstarter to Pilot a 4-Day Workweek
    The COVID-19 pandemic upended work for everyone. Suddenly, the 
norms around where, when, and how work got done shifted radically. 
Kickstarter, like many companies, pivoted to being a fully remote 
company, and we adapted quickly to new forms of working together. That 
shift demonstrated just how ingrained, and potentially outdated, some 
of our assumptions are around the way we work. But the pandemic also 
clarified something else--that the time we have with our families and 
our loved ones is the most valuable thing in our lives, an insight that 
made us more critically assess the time we do spend at work.

    Kickstarter is a data-driven organization, and our interest in the 
4-day workweek began with the mounting evidence that a 4-day workweek 
can work for the mutual benefit of businesses and its employees. 
Studies from trials in Europe and success stories from pioneering 
organizations in the U.S. all showed that this was possible. Poring 
through the research led to a simple conclusion: the data was good.

    We also knew that our employees were stressed, trying to balance 
work and their personal lives--particularly employees with young 
children at home. Smartphones have connected us to the world in real 
time, while letting work follow us around everywhere we go. We wanted 
to give our employees the time and space to attend to the rest of their 
lives, enabling them to be their best selves at work.

    Finally, we recognized the common sense behind the data that showed 
the 4-day workweek works. Hours worked is a factor in productivity, but 
it's not determinative. Efficiency, focus, and employee retention are 
all more critical in driving organizational output. And the truth is, a 
lot of time at work is not used efficiently. Companies take up too much 
time meeting inefficiently, engaging inessential tasks, or performing 
the theater of work. Additionally, with an epidemic of burnout, workers 
are already finding ways to rest at work. They're surfing the Internet, 
working slowly, or just stepping away for a time to get the energy to 
continue with their workday.

    We were faced with a choice: we could either demand our employees 
give us time that wasn't being used effectively and efficiently, or we 
could strip the inefficiencies in our work and give time back to our 
employees to properly rest. Armed with the data from studies and pilots 
from around the world and with input from stakeholders across the 
organization, we opted for the better approach--the 4-day workweek.

    Once we decided we wanted to pilot a 4-day workweek, we quickly 
found support from our board and our employees for a pilot. We were 
actually in the middle of negotiating the first collective bargaining 
agreement with our newly formed union, who were pleasantly surprised by 
management's desire to move to a 4-day workweek, and we worked together 
on a provision in our CBA to facilitate policies for the pilot.
How Kickstarter Adapted to a 4-Day Workweek Without Losing Productivity
    Our goal in transitioning to a 4-day workweek was to maintain or 
improve overall productivity, while consistently giving employees more 
time back in their week. The bargain we made with our employees was 
simple: they would get an extra day back every week while retaining the 
same salaries and benefits, and in exchange, we expected them to manage 
their time effectively, show up to work every week rested and ready to 
go, and get the job done. We weren't going to scale back our goals or 
ambitions to accommodate the 4-day workweek.

    Kickstarter joined the first joint pilot in the U.S. that kicked 
off in April 2022, which was organized by 4 Day Week Global and an 
earlier iteration of the WorkFour campaign. Transitioning to a 4-day 
workweek required the active participation of every level of our 
company, and it didn't happen overnight. For executive leadership, the 
transition required us to set tightly focused goals for our teams, 
establish clear success metrics, and reaffirm a culture of high 
expectations and high trust. The 4-day workweek requires leaders to be 
sharper and clearer--there's less room for error in our own 
performance. That's a challenge we embrace. At the team level, we 
significantly trimmed meeting time, and identified and reduced the 
lowest impact work. Almost any employee you talk to could tell you a 
few ways that their job wastes their time. The 4-day workweek is an 
opportunity to collectively identify and strip away those 
inefficiencies. At the individual level, we expected our employees to 
manage their time effectively, and show up to work more focused and 
more motivated.

    Different teams had to make different adjustments. Our product 
teams focused on improving their development processes. Our support 
teams, which have to respond to user tickets and issues 7 days a week, 
invested in additional automation and extended their weekend rotations 
to cover 3 days instead of two. Our creator success team, which works 
with our top accounts, proactively set expectations with creators that 
we would be less responsive on Fridays, but would still be available if 
the matter was urgent. Nothing we did was radical or revolutionary, but 
working together with the shared benefit of a shorter workweek, we were 
able to structure our work to fit a 4-day schedule.
    Outcomes of the 4-Day Workweek for Kickstarter and its Employees
    Data informed our decision to trial a 4-day workweek, and we used 
data to assess the success of our pilot. We measured our performance by 
whether we were able to hit our overall goals, maintain our user 
response times and satisfaction, and actually reduce working hours. The 
outcomes were clear. In the 6-months of the pilot, our ability to hit 
our company goals jumped from 62 percent to 95 percent. Our response 
times and user satisfaction remained the same. Satisfaction with work-
life balance increased from 48 percent to 81 percent. Employee 
retention rose from 82 percent to 98 percent. We managed these outcomes 
while reducing, on average, staff working time by 9 hours a week. Faced 
with the data of our experience, we made the decision to maintain our 
4-day workweek going forward.

    It has now been 2 years since we adopted the 4-day workweek and the 
benefits persist. We rarely see an employee choose to leave the 
company. That means our teams stay together longer, work together 
better, and our turnover costs are reduced. Meetings are like weeds and 
need to be occasionally cut down to keep us working efficiently. 
Maintaining focus and clarity in how we direct the company remains 
critical for supporting our staff in hitting their goals in fewer hours 
each week.

    For as beneficial as this shift has been for us as a company, it is 
a profound change for our employees. In just 2 years, and with a staff 
of about 100 people, we've been able to return nearly 10,000 days to 
our employees. That's more than 27 years. Those are years of our 
employees spending more time with their children and families, 
volunteering in their communities, learning new skills, and taking care 
of their health. The value of that time is priceless, and ultimately 
that has been the greatest outcome of our transition to a 4-day 
workweek.
         Building the National Campaign for the 4-Day Workweek
    Motivated by the success of Kickstarter and other companies across 
America, my co-founder Jon Steinman and I established WorkFour not just 
to help accelerate this change that we believe will benefit everyone--
and that so many of us are clamoring for--but to help ensure the 
transition benefits everyone. Our economy has not always delivered 
fairly to all who help power it forward. Returning invaluable time to 
everyone who participates in our economy is the right decision and a 
smart re-investment that the United States should make in its people.

    The 5-day workweek is not an immutable law of nature, it was 
established 100 years ago here in the United States. It was the product 
of visionary leadership from policymakers, unions, and private industry 
who recognized that our economy was built on far more than hours 
clocked and products shipped. The economy is all of us, too, working; 
it's all of us going to the office, climbing into the cab of a long 
haul truck, donning the welder's mask. Critics of the 5-day workweek 
predicted doom, as they worried that a weekend would set the United 
States' economy back. Instead, it helped launch us to the front of the 
global pack. Entire industries of recreation and leisure were born, the 
American middle class became the envy of the world, and the weekend 
became the time when families and neighbors came together.

    Now, it's time for a much overdue update.

    Enormous advances in technology helped enable the original weekend, 
and the same is going to be true for expanding it. Sophisticated 
technology is further driving corporate efficiencies and innovation; 
productivity and profits are soaring. With the rapid development of 
applied Artificial Intelligence in the workplace, we are on the verge 
of even more change. Bill Gates \1\ and Jamie Dimon \2\ are already 
predicting the need to transition to a three or three and a half day 
workweek. Change isn't coming, it's upon us--our generation's choice is 
what we make of it. With the opportunity we have now, it's important to 
ensure all American workers and our society reap the dividends.

    The latest round of studies continues to echo what we've already 
learned: when piloted, the 4-day workweek produces increased 
organizational efficiency, happier employees, and lower rates of 
turnover. All 35 North American companies that piloted a 4-day workweek 
with us in 2022 have kept it. These are individual organizations 
achieving individual results. If it didn't work, for-profit companies 
would abandon it. You don't need theories or advanced data, you just 
need to see that the companies that try it, almost always stick with 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
it.

    As with the original weekend, when the 4-day workweek is the norm, 
the benefits will scale across society. Research suggests that beyond 
improved workplace productivity and employee well-being, communities 
and families will benefit as will our environment \3\--and perhaps our 
civic bonds as well.

    At WorkFour, we're supporting the employers, unions, and 
policymakers at the forefront of this transition. We've worked with 
employers across the country who have successfully adopted a shorter 
workweek, and these are not just white-collar companies. Advanced RV is 
a manufacturer in Willoughby, Ohio, who builds custom mobile homes. 
They moved to a 4-day workweek in 2022, finding efficiencies that 
enabled them to maintain their output while dramatically improving the 
well-being and happiness of their employees. 4C Health is a behavioral 
health provider in Indiana employing hundreds of workers and serving 
thousands of patients. Facing a worker shortage in healthcare, they 
moved to a shorter workweek, which improved productivity, retention, 
and recruitment and decreased clinician burnout by 50 percent. The 
Golden, Colorado Police Department launched a 4-day, 32-hour workweek 
in July 2023. Six months in, they found that their response times 
improved, burnout amongst officers decreased, and the city saved 
$115,000 in overtime compensation. \4\ ThredUp, a clothing retailer and 
publicly traded company with 300 employees, made the shift to 4 days 
permanent after a successful 1-year experiment, citing improved 
employee morale and increased productivity. This is a transition that 
can and must be made across industries, for the benefit of all workers.

    We appreciate the engagement of this Committee and the Senators in 
attendance today. We also appreciate that it's an election year, and 
there's plenty of partisanship to go around. But the 4-day workweek is 
an issue, backed by data, that Americans of all stripes, in poll after 
poll, say matters to them. Before us is the opportunity to deliver a 
boost to our economy and happiness to every American worker. The 
original weekend did just that.

    It's time to do it again.

    The Chair. Mr. Leland, thanks very much. Senator Cassidy, 
do you want introduce your witnesses?

    Senator Cassidy. Please. First, Dr. Liberty Vittert is a 
Professor of the Practice of Data Science at the Olin Business 
School at Wash. U. in St. Louis. She is a Senior Fellow at 
Harvard University and MIT researcher, on air statistician from 
News Nation, two Discovery Channel shows, and analyzes and 
calls elections for Decision Desk HQ, and is featured in a 
number of publications.

    Has a great resume for academics. But what is most 
interesting about Dr. Vittert is that she studied at Le Cordon 
Bleu. So, we actually have someone here who knows how to cook 
something more than pancakes, which, no offense, I am sure 
others do as well. Anyway, so we--you would call it a crepe. 
Anyway, so we are pleased to have you.

 STATEMENT LIBERTY VITTERT, PROFESSOR OF THE PRACTICE OF DATA 
  SCIENCE, OLIN BUSINESS SCHOOL, WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST. 
                      LOUIS, ST. LOUIS, MO

    Dr. Vittert. I should have made some chocolate chip cookies 
for the group. Chairman Sanders, Dr. Cassidy, Senator 
Hickenlooper, thank you so much for having me here today. I am 
a statistician, and we have heard a lot of statistics thrown 
around.

    I am here to make some sense of these and make sure we are 
analyzing them properly. Proponents of the 32 hour workweek 
often point to statistical studies, mostly pilots, that suggest 
shorter workweeks can lead to increased productivity and 
improved employee well-being.

    But this argument is making broad claims based upon weak 
and statistically flawed data sets. A closer look at some of 
the most popularly cited studies reveals significant flaws and 
limitations. We will take a brief look at some of these studies 
to understand these statistical flaws and shed significant and 
potentially insurmountable doubt on the proposal's 
sustainability in the American work economy.

    Many of the news headlines touting these studies discuss 
the stress or happiness levels of workers who work less time. 
Inevitably, over the short term, in these short pilot projects, 
it is not inconceivable to imagine that happiness levels 
increase. The question is where does the pendulum end?

    At no work. Statistical studies, long term statistical 
studies of this, have shown us that happiness does not increase 
over time, it goes back to the same level. For example, the 
study in France, after a mandatory Government reduction of 
hours, saw a return to the same level of happiness after 7 
years.

    If you want to see those same employees really stressed 
out, just see what happens where their employers lay them off 
to hire part time workers instead or have to close their doors 
because they cannot make enough revenue. Another major flaw in 
these studies is the self-selection bias.

    For example, the companies that choose to participate in 
some of these studies, like the Four Day Week Global Study, are 
companies whose work tend to be able to be adapted to a shorter 
workweek already. Who can remove ``wasted hours.''

    Specifically, only companies that are able to adapt to 
shorter workweek that tend to participate. Cutting out, as they 
say, extraneous meetings, coffee breaks, having more 
independent work, going to Zoom.

    However, over 70 percent of the U.S. job economy is people 
working with their hands. They don't necessarily have 
extraneous meetings or too many coffee breaks to cut out. So 
statistically, you can't apply this type of cutting of hours 
across the entire economy.

    Also, given the types of companies that are potentially 
capable of cutting their workweek, we could see a divide of the 
rich getting richer, having more time, and the poor needing to 
take on three part time jobs in order to pay the bills.

    We also potentially disadvantage older workers who cannot 
necessarily physically do the same amount of work in a shorter 
time. This happened to the great detriment of that population 
during the Great Depression.

    In terms of increased productivity, by shortening the week, 
the statistics just aren't there, and there are specific 
studies that show the opposite. Japan tried it, as Dr. Cassidy 
said, from 1988 to 1996, and the result was not ambiguous.

    Economic output fell by 20 percent. Another largely touted 
study was in Iceland, which had a pilot program cutting the 
workweek by about 4 hours from 2015 to 2019. The results were 
blasted all over the headlines as this overwhelming success.

    What is not reported on is that the Icelandic government, 
or rather taxpayers, now have to shell out almost $30 million 
extra a year to hire more health care workers because of this 
experiment. In Spain, where there is a pilot program, the 
companies that participate get access to a multi-million dollar 
government fund in order to participate.

    Microsoft also tested a 4-day workweek by shutting down its 
Japan office every Friday for the month of August. The 
statistical claim is that this resulted in a 40 percent 
increase in productivity.

    This is a statistical fallacy that correlation is not 
necessarily causation. Productivity increased over a very, very 
short period of time during a low productivity month when 
overall productivity was already at a 75 year low. There is no 
statistical evidence to merit a nationwide mandate of a 32 hour 
workweek.

    In fact, there is clear evidence against it. If it works 
for some companies in some sectors, that is great. But it 
cannot be applied to all sectors. Thank you.

   Flaws in Statistical Studies on the 32-Hour Work Week: A Critical 
                              Examination
    The idea of a 32-hour work week has gained a significant following 
as a solution to modern workplace challenges i.e. burnout, stress, and 
work-life balance. Proponents often point to statistical studies (pilot 
programs in general) that suggest shorter work hours can lead to 
increased productivity and improved employee well-being. The argument 
for the 32 hour week is much more tendentious, making broad claims 
based on weak and flawed data sets. A closer look at some of the most 
popularly cited studies reveals significant flaws and limitations that 
call into question their reliability and validity. We will take a brief 
look at some of these studies to understand the statistical flaws that 
shed significant and insurmountable doubt on the proposal's 
sustainability in the American work economy and threaten what makes our 
Nation's future prosperity possible.
                             Productivity:
    The definition of productivity is very different throughout these 
statistical studies, as is the measure of success. Is it sales per 
agent? Is it company revenue? Is it country GDP? Or, in most cases, is 
it simply self-reported data by the employees? There are no clear 
statistical studies showing that in the long-term, less hours would 
produce more productivity unless productivity is already low or any 
increase is simply along the same lines as regular expected and planned 
for increases in a company's yearly outlook. A large statistical study 
was already conducted in Japan on this topic. From 1988 to 1996 (the 
longest study I have found), Japan shortened the work week from 46 to 
30 hours. The result was not ambiguous: Economic output fell by 20 
percent. Productivity simply could not increase enough to compensate 
for the country's economic loss. Ignoring these major studies is what 
we call in statistics ``cherry-picking''--only choosing the studies, or 
rather pieces of studies, that suit our particular point. In Japan, 
Microsoft also tested a 4-day work week by shutting down its Japan 
office every Friday during the month of August. The claim is that this 
resulted in a 40 percent increase in productivity. But if that's true, 
then why aren't they doing this everywhere Microsoft operates? Again, 
the answer is simple: Productivity increased over a very short period 
of time during a low-productivity summer month, when overall 
productivity was already at a 75-year low. This clearly also does not 
show Japan's productivity across multiple sectors, only one very 
particular company, giving us absolutely no statistically valid 
insight. Multiple studies that have shown some increase in productivity 
are not necessarily not looking at shortened hours (i.e. 40 to 32 hours 
per week) but rather a shortened work week (i.e. working 10 hours per 
day for 4 days). This is not the proposal here and provides possible 
consequences like more accidents, insufficient quality in product 
production or potentially more stress for workers.

    On this note, advocates of the 32 hour work week often cite a study 
out of Iceland conducted between 2015 and 2019 (cutting from the 
traditional 40 hours to a 35-36 hour work week), which purportedly 
found positive outcomes associated with shorter work hours. However, a 
critical examination of the statistical methodology used in this study 
reveals significant flaws that call into question its validity and 
generalizability.

    The Iceland study introduces several methodological challenges. For 
instance, the study relied on self-reported data (the employees who are 
directly affected by the study are reporting on themselves), which is 
susceptible to severe biases. Additionally, a lack of randomization in 
assigning workers who choose to participate in the pilot program versus 
the `control' (does not reduce hours) can cause serious statistical 
selection bias and confounding variables.

    Furthermore, two think tanks that heavily lobby the government for 
shorter working weeks base their case on this study. But the first 
thing to note is that many of the cited studies didn't actually test a 
4-day week at all. Rather, it shortened their overall hours in a 5-day 
week. We need to be clear when discussing a ``4 day work week'' versus 
``number of hours worked''. For example, a large study in Belgium only 
looked at a condensed work week i.e. the same number of hours just over 
a shorter period. The Iceland trial only included a little more than 1 
percent of that nation's workforce. However, in terms of economic 
output and productivity, it had negative consequences in specific 
field. The Icelandic government had to expend almost $30 million extra 
each year to hire more healthcare workers because of the experiment.

    It is clear from the trial participant's own language and the study 
conductors that a key to any success in this study was removing 
``wasted hours'' at work. For example, work meetings were shortened or 
coffee breaks were reduced. This type of pencil-cutting is clearly not 
feasible for the vast majority of the job economy. While the study 
touts that roughly ``86 percent of Iceland's population has either 
moved to shorter working hours or have gained the right to shortened 
their working hours'' that is highly statistically misleading. Large 
groups of workers had their work week shortened by 18 minutes, not 
hours.

    Even further studies show that the only way a program can succeed 
by having less hours for the same pay is with government subsidies. For 
example, Spain started a trial program in December 2022 with the pilot 
helping businesses cut their working week by half a day without 
reducing salaries. However, companies that choose (again self-
selection) to do this, are eligible to receive aid from a multimillion 
dollar government fund. A study by 4 day week global showcased revenue 
increases during their 6 month trial period with hiring increasing. 
Without sounding too repetitive, self-selection of the companies 
participating in this study is crucial for the statistical veracity. 
Smaller companies are probably hiring more. In the short-term, more pay 
for less work could increase hiring. Last, period of the trial was from 
June 2022-December 2022, while recovery was high anyway-an increase in 
revenue could have been correlation and not causation.
                          Stress and Happiness
    Many of the news headlines touting these studies discuss the stress 
or happiness levels of workers who work less time. Inevitably, over the 
short term, it is not inconceivable to imagine that happiness levels 
increase--the question is where does the pendulum end--at no work? 
Statistical studies show that it doesn't actually matter if we decrease 
the work time in the long run-workers' happiness fails to improve over 
these long-term studies. For example, in France, the government 
mandated the reduction of the standard work week from 39 hours to 35 
hours. There was no evidence that this increased workers' happiness and 
in fact, decreased it, due to the need of companies to hire part-time, 
cheaper, workers. Worker satisfaction in general is not at a terrifying 
low-in fact personal well-being levels have increased in many countries 
according to census data. As with the study in Iceland, this data is 
self-reported and therefore highly susceptible to statistical fallacy. 
But more importantly, we need to examine long term effects. How will 
workers feel when they don't have a job anymore because the company had 
to close due to lose productivity and profits or when the company 
hires, cheaper, part-time labor, or when they have to work two jobs in 
order to make the same income because of this? Multiple studies show 
these long-term poor effects on workers' stress and happiness.

    Concurrently, many companies that participate in these studies, one 
would imagine, feel the need to keep going i.e. they are self-
selecting. Imagine over a 6 month period you give your employees the 
same pay for 32 hours of work instead of 40 hours of work but then tell 
them they need to go back to 40 hours of work for the same pay. Even 
the largely touted 4 day week Global study says in their own words 
``The initiative, which only involves companies whose work can be 
adapted to a shorter workweek, is led by Berlin-based management 
consultancy Intraprenhr together with the non-profit organisation 4 Day 
Week Global (4DWG).'' By definition, this concept and any statistical 
findings from it cannot be extrapolated to the work economy at large. 
It is specifically only companies that are able to adapt to a shorter 
workweek by cutting out, as they say, extraneous meetings or having 
more independent work. Over 75 percent of the U.S. job economy is 
people working with their hands, they don't have extraneous meetings or 
too many coffee breaks to cut out. Statistically, you cannot apply this 
generality across all types of companies by any stretch.
                     Polarization of Labor Markets
    Given the types of companies that are potentially capable of 
cutting their work week, we could see a divide of the rich getting 
richer (or working less time) and the poor needing to take on part time 
jobs. Given our largely aging population, we also potentially 
disadvantage older workers who cannot necessarily physically do the 
same amount of work in a shorter time. For example, this was the case 
in the United States when the work week was reduced during the great 
depression. This is all to say that the current statistical studies do 
not show us what the long-term effects are on a country's workforce and 
economy. Imagining that a 6 month or 2 year study will show us this is 
statistically dangerous.

    This also does not account for the workers that companies will have 
to bring in to make up for like the loss of workers in the Iceland 
study that the government needed to make up for. But there are even 
larger effects. Given the potential need for companies to hire part-
time workers to ensure that productivity does not decrease (or to man 
the phones on Fridays), part-time unemployment could potentially 
increase significantly which are usually associated with lower-paying 
jobs and lack of benefits.

    The trial by 4 day week global showed many of these issues. First, 
it was not a full reduction of hours from 40 to 32 hours. The study 
required a ``meaningful reduction'' which is not defined from my 
inspection. Second, it is self-selected companies (a majority of which 
had less than 25 workers) and the companies that had issues with this 
short trial were specifically ``reliant on continuous client engagement 
or time-sensitive deliverables''. This, by definition, is a majority of 
the work economy in the United States.

   Flaws in Statistical Studies on the 32-Hour Workweek: a Critical 
                              Examination
    There are significant statistical flaws in all of the studies I 
have examined and are regularly touted as proof of concept for the 
shortened workweek. There are also many overlooked studies that show 
the true detriment to both the workers and the economy of the country.

    Based on this, in my testimony today I will make four main points:

    First, productivity does not necessarily increase with a shortened 
workweek in the long-term. Besides the issue of defining exactly what 
productivity or success means in different companies or countries, we 
have seen in multiple studies that long-term there is a significant 
decrease in productivity as measured by the country's GDP (a study in 
Japan run from 1988 to 1996) where economic output fell by 20 percent 
after a significant reduction in working hours.

    Second, there is a large self-selection issue of companies 
participating in these studies such as with the 4 Day Week Global 
study. The companies are choosing to participate, potentially meaning 
that they are small and trying to grow (enticing new workers) or are 
capable of reducing hours by removing extraneous meetings, coffee 
breaks etc., a point made by the study conductors themselves. Given 
that 75 percent of the workforce in the United States works with their 
hands, there are no extraneous meetings to cut out.

    Third, a study in Iceland that is widely cited as a measure of the 
success of the shortened workweek, fails to mention that the Icelandic 
government had to expend almost $30 million extra to hire more 
healthcare workers because of the experiment. This is also the case 
with a study in Spain where companies that participate in the pilot 
were also eligible for a multi-million dollar government fund to help 
subsidize.

    Fourth, the concept that this reduction in hours will automatically 
increase happiness and decrease stress long-term is statistically 
flawed. For example, in France, the government mandated the reduction 
of the standard workweek from 39 hours to 35 hours. There was no 
evidence that this increased workers' happiness and in fact, decreased 
it, due to the need of companies to hire part-time, cheaper, workers. 
Should workers not have jobs, or have to work two jobs since with this 
plan companies are incentivized to hire part-time workers instead, 
stress and unhappiness will surely increase.

    Senator Cassidy. Thank you, Ms. Vittert. Next is Mr. Roger 
King, a Senior Labor and Employment Counsel at the HR Policy 
Association, which represents the chief human resource officers 
of nearly 400 of the largest businesses.

    He is highly regarded as a labor relations attorney. Career 
spanning more than 40 years. He began out of law school as a 
counsel for this Committee. He told me he was a peer with Angus 
King, one of our colleagues, and that he in his day worked with 
Robert Taft Junior, a very young Teddy Kennedy, Jacob Javits, 
and others.

    It is like a homecoming week for you. Thanks for being 
here, Mr. King.

 STATEMENT OF ROGER KING, SENIOR LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT COUNSEL, 
              HR POLICY ASSOCIATION, ARLINGTON, VA

    Mr. King. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, Dr. Cassidy, 
Members of the Committee, it is indeed a distinct honor to come 
back before this Committee again. I had great experiences here 
working with Robert Taft Jr., Fritz Mondale, Ted Kennedy, Jack 
Javits. And, yes, Angus King and I used to go out for an adult 
beverage now and then in this community.

    Thank you again for having me back. And I am appearing 
here, Dr. Cassidy as you mentioned, on behalf of the HR Policy 
Association. We represent approximately 10 percent of the 
private sector workers in this country through our corporate 
members. I would like to start the discussion about mandating 
32 hours over 8 hours, over 12 hours.

    These are concepts that have consequences. This proposal 
only works if you reduce 8 hours a workweek and have the 
workers have the same level of productivity that they had at 40 
hours. It just doesn't work in many industries. It doesn't work 
economically. It doesn't work operationally.

    Then what we have is what I call a productivity gap, where 
we have work that is not getting done for the 32 hour workweek 
situation. How do you fill that productivity gap? And as you 
mentioned, Senator Cassidy, the inflationary impact of this 
type of proposal is considerable.

    I noted this week that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
said that we have inflation at 3.2 percent, ticked up from 
January. Our core inflation is 3.8 or more. Well beyond the 2 
percent target rate for the Feds.

    This is bad policy as it results to the consumer. So, what 
do I mean by that? If you can't fill the productivity gap by 
cutting back hours or making some adjustments in your business, 
you pass on added costs to the consumer. You have to pay for it 
some way.

    The other very important point I would like to make at the 
beginning of my testimony is flexibility is the most important 
thing that we are hearing from workers today. They want as much 
flexibility as possible as to how, when, and where they perform 
work.

    The proposal of the Chairman, and all due respect, is going 
to interfere with that flexibility. Workers today want to be 
able to spend more time with their families. I certainly agree 
with the panel of witnesses on that point. They also want to 
select though, as I said, when, where, and how they work.

    Let's go to the history of the Fair Labor Standards Act 
just for a moment. It has been mentioned already numerous 
times. If you go back and look at the history of the New Deal 
and why President Franklin Roosevelt was initiating this 
proposal, it was to increase the number of jobs in the country.

    The evidence is clear. That proposal was put in place by 
the Congress to increase the number of Americans to come to the 
workplace. The proposal of the Chairman will require the 
creation of more jobs, especially, part-time jobs. We already 
have a tremendous shortage of workers.

    Industry after industry doesn't have enough workers today. 
This proposal for many employers will cause even further worker 
shortages. The flexibility factor is a problem. Now, we do 
commend the Chairman and this Committee for having a hearing on 
the impact of AI. It is considerable.

    Senator Cassidy, I think your suggestion for a bipartisan 
discussion is excellent. We would welcome that. There is no 
question AI can increase productivity. And there is no question 
that increased wealth can occur. This is what I call the AI 
dividend wealth. And we agree that workers and employers alike 
should share in that wealth. But the way to go about that is 
let the market determine that distribution of wealth.

    If Mr. Fain's union can negotiate a 32 hour workweek, so be 
it. If he can convince the auto worker companies in this 
country to do it, so be it. But let the market determine how 
the distribution of wealth is to occur.

    Finally, as an overall point, we commend the Committee for 
starting a discussion about the Fair Labor Standards Act. This 
is one of the most litigated statutes in the country. Mr. 
Chairman, you are absolutely correct, we need to reexamine it. 
The amount of litigation that occurs regarding the Fair Labor 
Standards Act is way over the top. We need to address more 
clarity in this statute.

    I have listed in my testimony a number of problems with the 
32 hour workweek. I would close with this comment. I just saw 
the Senator's bill last night, and it is even more extreme than 
I had thought we were going to be discussing today.

    The requirement to pay overtime over 8 hours will be a 
significant economic adverse impact on many companies, and the 
requirement to pay double time over 12 hours. I think the only 
state in the country that does that is California.

    That, from our perspective, is quite extreme. One last 
point is an example, just to bring this home, health care 
employers in this country generally employ registered nurses 
for three 12 hour shifts.

    It is not just four--they have gone to three workdays, but 
they are 12 hour shifts in a work week. And that works by and 
large. But this proposal would require between that 36 and 32 
hour, 4 additional hours of overtime, and additionally, it 
would require overtime over 8. That is going to have a very 
negative impact on the health care community in this country 
and cause health care expenses to go up.

    The solution for the health care community is to get more 
nurses, more workers into the employment stream, not to impose 
strict standards that will cripple employers and cause 
incremental costs. Thank you very much.

                    prepared statement of roger king
    Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Members of the 
Committee:

    Thank you for the opportunity to again testify before the 
Committee. Each time I appear before this Committee, it is a special 
privilege as one of the first employment positions I had after 
graduating law school was serving as a professional staff counsel for 
the Committee. In that capacity, I had the opportunity to work for 
Senator Robert Taft, Jr., Senator Jack Javits, Senator Ted Kennedy, 
Senator Walter Mondale, and many other outstanding and influential 
members of the Senate.

    This morning, I am appearing on behalf of the HR Policy Association 
where I serve as the Senior Labor and Employment Counsel. HR Policy is 
a public policy advocacy organization that represents the chief human 
resource officers of more than 350 of the largest corporations doing 
business in the United States and globally. Collectively, their 
companies employ more than 10 million employees in the United States--
nearly 9 percent of the private sector workforce. Since its founding, 
one of HRPA's principal missions has been to ensure that laws and 
policies affecting human resources are sound, practical, and responsive 
to labor and employment issues arising in the workplace. My 
biographical information \1\ is attached to my written testimony. I 
respectfully request that my written testimony and the exhibits thereto 
be included as part of the record of the hearing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\  Mr. King is a graduate of Miami University (1968) and Cornell 
University Law School (1971). Mr. King is a member of the District of 
Columbia and Ohio State Bar Associations, and his professional 
experience includes serving as a legislative staff assistant to Senator 
Robert Taft Jr. and professional staff counsel to the United States 
Senate Labor Committee (1971-1974), associate and partner with Bricker 
& Eckler (1974-1990), partner and of counsel at Jones Day (1990-2014), 
and Senior Labor & Employment Counsel at HR Policy Association 
(2014Present). Mr. King acknowledges the assistance of Daniel Yager, 
his colleague at the HR Policy Association, in the preparation of his 
testimony.

    Initially, I want to note that the Association is not opposed to 
32-hour workweeks or other non-traditional workweek configurations that 
make operational and financial sense for employers and provide 
flexibility for employees. We are, however, opposed to amending the 
Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to change the overtime requirements for 
nonexempt employees from 40 hours to 32 hours. \2\ We agree with 
Senator Sanders' objective of holding this hearing to explore options 
for employees to share any ``AI wealth dividend'' that may occur as a 
result of AI-related productivity advances in the workplace. Where we 
part ways with the Chairman, however, is that we believe any such 
wealth distribution should not be mandated by government intervention, 
but rather traditional market forces should determine how any AI wealth 
dividends should be distributed. As illustrated in the following chart, 
productivity and employee compensation increases have generally closely 
tracked one another for many decades. \3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\  The Association opposes HB 1332, which would phase-in changes 
to the FLSA 40-hour overtime workweek standard to a 32-hour standard.

    Accordingly, there is no need for government intervention in 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
this area.

    Finally, we commend the Committee for initiating a discussion about 
potential amendments to the FLSA. Given the considerable change in the 
workplace since the FLSA was enacted in 1938, there certainly is a need 
for Congress to do a review of this statute. Such a review would be 
particularly helpful for all stakeholders, given the fact that the 
statute has been subject to conflicting interpretations by the Wage and 
Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor and the courts. In fact, 
this statute is one of the most frequently litigated statutes in the 
Federal courts. For example, in 2023, there were 5,532 court filings 
involving the FLSA, and according to a report by the Seyfarth Shaw law 
firm, many of these lawsuits involved complex and ``novel and creative 
claims and Supreme Court/appellate level battles . . . over long-
accepted standards.'' \4\ Reduction in such costly litigation and often 
conflicting interpretations of the FLSA should be addressed by 
Congress.

legalnews/2023-flsa-litigation-metrics-trends-4777793/.

    Before we begin our discussion this morning, I believe it is 
important that we level set the parameters of our conversation. It is 
my understanding that the Chairman's intent for holding this hearing 
today is to discuss scenarios where employees do not perform work for 
their employers for more than 4 days in a workweek, work no more than 
32 hours in such workweek, and continue to receive the same amount of 
pay they would have received in a traditional 40-hour workweek setting. 
\5\ Senator Sanders has not to date provided specific details regarding 
his thoughts with respect to the 32-hour workweek and the corresponding 
requirement that employees suffer no decrease in wages. One could 
assume, however, that he is only considering nonexempt employees in his 
thinking--if he is also contemplating exempt employees in any proposal 
in this area, substantial amendments would have to be made to the FLSA. 
\6\ Finally, it is my understanding that the Chairman believes, 
consistent with the above objectives, that the FLSA should be amended 
to require employers to pay overtime to nonexempt employers after 32 
hours of work in a workweek. As I understand it, the rationale for such 
initiatives is to assist nonexempt employees to receive part of any 
``AI wealth dividends'' that certain employers may receive from 
utilizing AI-related workplace technology. My testimony is predicated 
on the above understandings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\  The title of this hearing only states that employees would not 
suffer a reduction in pay they are currently receiving by working a 40-
hour workweek and then moving to a 32-hour workweek. I am assuming, 
however, that Senator Sanders would also take the position that 
employees in a 32-hour workweek schedule situation would receive the 
same level of benefits. This is an important point as the U.S. 
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics has concluded employee 
benefits account for approximately 29.4 percent of an employee's total 
weekly payroll costs to private sector employees.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   The 40-Hour Workweek and the FLSA
    A good beginning point for our discussion is a brief review of the 
origin of the 40-hour workweek and the enactment of the FLSA. The 
origin of the 40-hour workweek in the United States is generally 
attributed to Henry Ford, who, in the 1920's, instituted a new work 
schedule for the auto workers in his plants. Mr. Ford changed his 
employees' work schedules to provide for 2 days off each workweek yet 
maintained a schedule consisting of five 8-hour workdays--the 40-hour 
workweek. Thereafter, President Franklin Roosevelt, as part of his 
``New Deal'' reform initiatives, made proposals to require overtime to 
be paid over a certain number of hours worked in a workweek. The 
overtime provisions that President Roosevelt was seeking were intended 
to reduce the number of hours worked by an employer's current workforce 
and create jobs for the substantial number of unemployed workers in the 
country at that time. \7\ President Roosevelt's initiatives ultimately 
resulted in the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938. The 
statute, initially in its overtime requirements, established a 44-hour 
standard, with phase-in provisions ultimately moving the overtime 
provision to a 40-hour standard in 1940. (See attachment 1).

                    The potential AI Wealth Dividend
    Various studies and pilot projects have provided convincing 
evidence that the adoption of AI technology in the workplace can result 
in positive outcomes for all stakeholders. \8\ For example, in a recent 
study, Goldman Sachs concluded that AI could raise global GDP by 7 
percent. \9\

machines-of-mind-the-case-for-an-ai-powered-productivity-boom/.

    Understanding of the impact of AI in the workplace, however, is in 
the embryotic stages of development, with widely varying analyses. Some 
predictions have concluded that there is a substantial potential for 
considerable job loss because of the implementation of such new 
technology--other studies, however, present glowing predictions of 
enhanced opportunities for employers and employees alike. Accordingly, 
given the numerous labor relations policy issues presented by AI, we 
agree with Chairman Sanders that this issue should be given significant 
attention, and we commend the Committee for initiating this discussion. 
As noted above, however, where we part ways with Senator Sanders is 
this proposal to have intervention by governmental entities to 
distribute any potential ``AI wealth dividend.'' Employers should be 
given considerable flexibility and latitude on how to run their 
businesses. Entrepreneurial innovation, including the implementation of 
reduced workweek schedules, should be encouraged and incentivized but 
not mandated by government intervention.
                       Workers Desire Flexibility
    Workers today are asking that their employer provide as much 
flexibility as possible for when, where, and how work is to be 
performed. \10\ Many employees today want to work remotely or in hybrid 
situations and set their own hours of employment. They seek flexibility 
for more family time, increased opportunities to engage in social and 
academic activities, and to achieve a better work-life balance. Given 
these well-established findings that employees in the workplace today 
are requesting more flexibility, what is the rationale to mandate any 
rigid type of workweek? For this reasons and other concerns outlined 
below--and perhaps other policy, economic, and legal reasons--the 
Association submits that the Committee should consider the following 
issues in its deliberations regarding the merits, or lack thereof, for 
a 32-hour workweek and a corresponding requirement that employers not 
reduce employees' wages and benefits in any potential change from a 40-
hour workweek.

    ``We have a lot of jobs, but not enough workers to fill them. If 
every unemployed person in the country found a job, we would still have 
nearly 3 million open jobs.'' \11\ Employers from construction, to 
healthcare, to the service industry currently cannot find enough 
employees. These shortages of employees are well-documented. \12\ For 
example, one recent study concluded that an estimated 501,000 
additional workers are needed in the construction industry on top of 
the normal job pace of hiring in 2024. The same study concluded, in 
2025, that the construction industry will need to bring in nearly 
454,000 new workers, on top of new hiring, to meet industry demand. 
\13\ Thousands of positions in hospitals, clinics, and long-term care 
facilities also cannot be filled, including projections by the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics that the country will face a shortage of 195,400 
nurses by the year 2031 and that the number of job openings for home 
and personal health aids will increase 37 percent by 2028. \14\

    The adoption of a 32-hour workweek would increase, in many 
instances, the number of positions an employer would need to fill to 
meet client and customer demands, with no corresponding strategy for 
how these shortages should be addressed. Consider, for example, a 
refinery that operates on a 24/7 basis and uses four crews. Such an 
employer hypothetically has four people for every position, and the 
employees take turns filling a job during a 40-hour workweek. If each 
crew were forced to change to a 32-hour workweek, the employer would 
have to hire an additional crew. This would be a 25 percent increase in 
staffing with corresponding payroll increments. The only other solution 
this employer would have would be to significantly increase overtime 
for the existing crews, assuming the workers in question were willing 
to work the additional hours and such overtime did not present safety 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
issues.

        <bullet>  Congress should not set private employers' wage 
        structures

    The second part of Senator Sanders' change in the law (after the 
32-hour overtime amendment to the FLSA) would require employers not to 
reduce the wages (and presumably benefits) for employees who are moved 
from a 40-hour workweek to a 32-hour workweek. The impact of this 
approach is to force employers to change their wage structure--they 
would be required to provide a certain level of pay for employees, who 
then would be working reduced hours. This approach would require 
congressional action. Even assuming Congress had the constitutional 
authority under the Commerce Clause or pursuant to some other 
constitutional theory to proceed in this manner, this is bad public 
policy. Governmental entities should not intervene in the employers' 
basic entrepreneurial rights to run their businesses, including the 
establishment of wage structures.

        <bullet>  FLSA overtime provisions were not enacted to be 
        wealth distribution mechanisms

    As stated above, the overtime provisions of the FLSA were enacted 
in 1938 to incentivize employers to create more jobs and to discourage 
employers from providing more hours of work to their existing 
workforce. Yet, the Chairman's proposal would attempt to utilize the 
Fair Labor Standards Act to distribute potential ``AI wealth 
dividends'' from employers to employees by government intervention. 
While we agree that employees should benefit from any AI wealth 
dividend, we do not agree that government intervention is the proper 
way to achieve this objective. Traditional market-related forces, with 
an underlying minimum wage safety net, should determine the rate of pay 
for private sector employees. When employers fail to reward their 
employees with increased wages for increased productivity gains, such 
employers will not be able to recruit or retain employees--they will 
lose their employees to competitors. Traditional market forces should 
determine how any AI wealth dividend is to be distributed. Indeed, 
various studies substantiate that historically productivity gains and 
increases in employee compensation are closely linked. \15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \15\  Id.

        <bullet>  Implementation of a 32-hour workweek with 
        corresponding requirement that no employees suffer any loss of 
        wages is a ``backdoor'' or ``workaround'' to the establishment 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        of a new Federal minimum wage

    Consider this example. Hypothetical employer X presently pays its 
nonexempt employees $20.00 an hour, and its employees work a 
traditional 40-hour workweek, receiving a total gross weekly pay of 
$800.00. Per the Chairman's approach, if employer X moves from the 
traditional 40-hour workweek to a 32-hour workweek, it would be 
required to provide its employees the same total weekly compensation of 
$800.00. Accordingly, such employees would then be making $25.00 an 
hour, a $5.00 an hour increase or a 25 percent increase over their 
previous hourly rate. Granted, this is not a direct establishment of a 
new Federal minimum wage, but it certainly is a workaround method of 
establishing minimum wages for employees in a potential transition from 
a 40-hour workweek to a 32-hour workweek. Minimum wage adjustments 
should be considered separately from Senator Sanders' proposal.

        <bullet>  Payroll cost impact on employers

    As illustrated above, the imposition of a 32-hour workweek can 
result in incremental payroll costs--when incremental benefit costs are 
added, the figure is even higher. The amount of work an employer needs 
to have completed in a workweek does not change in most instances if an 
employer converts to a 32-hour workweek, but under Senator Sanders' 
proposal, an employer will need to hire more employees or pay 
significant overtime for existing employees to meet its work 
requirements. Indeed, the Association notes that a rule presently 
pending at the Department of Labor would increase the compensation 
threshold of when employees are to be paid overtime. \16\ When you 
combine an employer's potential need to pay more overtime with the 
impact of such a proposed overtime rule requirement with the 
requirement by Senator Sanders that employees receive the same amount 
of pay and benefits for a reduced number of hours in a workweek, a 
potentially unsustainable increase in payroll expenses will be placed 
on many employers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\  New Proposed Overtime Regulation Is Wrong Rulemaking at Wrong 
Time, Marc Freedman, U.S. Chamber of Commerce (Sept. 14, 2023). 
www.uschamber.com/employment-law/new-proposed-overtime-regulation-is-
wrong-rulemaking-at-wrong-time. ``The new proposed regulation first 
published on September 7, 2023, will raise the salary threshold, below 
which an employee is non-exempt (or eligible to earn overtime) by more 
than 50 percent from the current $35,568/year ($684/week) to $55,068/
year ($1,059/week). The proposed rule also includes an automatic 
escalator clause to reset it every 3 years.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        <bullet>  Inflationary impact

    Even if an employer could successfully navigate a way to reschedule 
its workforce and pay the added costs associated with a 32-hour 
workweek, such added costs would, in virtually every instance, have to 
be passed on to consumers. Inflation is already a major problem in this 
country and has taken a substantial toll, particularly on working class 
families. \17\ For this reason alone, the imposition of a 32-hour 
workweek is not a sound policy option.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \17\  Pursuant to a report issued by the U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistic, inflation rose again for the 12 months ending in February to 
3.2 percent. The same report indicates that core inflation--which 
excludes volatile food and energy prices--rose 3.8 percent for the 12 
months ending in February. https://www.bls.gov/news.release/
cpi.nr0.htm.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        <bullet>  Operational coverage

    The imposition of a 32-hour workweek will force many employers to 
make difficult operational decisions. If an employer wishes to minimize 
overtime expenditures and not incur the cost of hiring additional 
workers, it may have to limit the number of hours of its operations. 
This may be obtainable in certain manufacturing settings (provided the 
same production output can be accomplished in a 32-hour vs. a 40-hour 
schedule) but will not be obtainable by other employers. For employers 
that must operate on a 24/7 basis (e.g., hospitals), they cannot close 
and the imposition of a 32-hour workweek is not practical. In such 
settings, significant increases in payroll costs will occur. Other 
employers, especially those in retail and hospitality, could reduce 
their hours of operation, but in doing so, they could face substantial 
negative customer/client reactions. For example, what if a hotel 
decided to only be open for 4 days in a week? Exercising such option 
not only may be financially unsound, but also not operationally viable. 
The employer could hire more workers and/or pay its existing workers 
more overtime, but again, proceeding with either option would 
undoubtedly result in significant increases in the cost of doing 
business.

        <bullet>  Scheduling disruption and interference with non-union 
        and unionized employer operations

    Many employers in this country have long-established scheduling 
systems that are well-accepted in the workplace. This is particularly 
true for employers such as hospitals and other employers that must 
operate on a 24/7 basis. Imposing a 32-hour workweek would adversely 
impact such operations and present significant scheduling issues. In 
unionized settings, employers and unions would be forced to renegotiate 
collective bargaining agreements, many of which have embraced the 40-
hour workweek for decades.

        <bullet>  Employee loss of work

    Mandating a 32-hour workweek, with a requirement that employees 
maintain their current compensation, may cause employers to eliminate 
certain positions. Alternatively, employers may split numerous full-
time positions into part-time positions to minimize overtime costs, 
thereby overall decreasing employee wages. Such an approach may 
directly conflict with concerns often voiced by employees in the 
workplace today that they cannot get enough hours of work from their 
employer and are, therefore, forced to work for more than one employer 
to meet basic costs of living expenses. Simply put, a 32-hour workweek 
may, in many situations, result in either job elimination or an 
increase in part-time work, thereby adversely impacting the overall 
compensation of employees.

        <bullet>  Will there be a potential adverse impact on Social 
        Security, Medicare, and state payroll tax-funded programs?

    What impact would a 32-hour workweek have on mandatory tax payments 
by employees and employers to the Social Security and Medicare trust 
funds? As noted above, some employers may be forced to eliminate 
positions or reduce payroll expenses by creating new part-time 
positions if a 32-hour workweek is mandated. Such deductions in overall 
payroll tax contributions certainly must be considered. Granted, some 
employers, however, may be forced to hire more workers or pay more 
overtime hours, thereby balancing out any eliminated positions or 
increased part-time positions, but AI may also result in a net 
reduction in total employee and employer payroll tax payments. Even 
minimal reductions in payroll tax contributions by employers to the 
Social Security and Medicare trust fund (and state unemployment-funded 
systems) could have significant adverse effects on such funds that are 
already on the brink of financial insolvency.

        <bullet>  Increase in employer benefit costs or reduction in 
        benefit coverage

    Employee benefit costs for private sector employees is 29.4 percent 
of an employer's total payroll cost. \18\ Pursuant to Senator Sanders' 
proposal, requiring employers to maintain the same level of pay and 
benefits for a reduced number of hours worked will, accordingly, 
increase the hourly benefit cost for each employee. Further, as noted 
above, certain employers may either eliminate positions or reduce the 
number of hours that employees work in a given workweek to accommodate 
the 32-hour a week schedule. Moving employees to part-time positions 
may result in such employees receiving a lesser amount of healthcare 
insurance benefit coverage or no benefit coverage altogether. If this 
occurs, there will be an adverse impact on our Nation's healthcare 
delivery system. This issue should be considered when analyzing the 
potential impact of a 32-hour workweek.

        <bullet>  Increased employee stress, related workplace safety 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        issues, and product/service quality

    While the proponents of a reduced workweek extoll the virtues of a 
3-day weekend and increased time off, the reality in most workplaces is 
that the same amount of work would still need to be done over a shorter 
number of hours. This pressure to produce the same amount of product or 
provide the same level of services can, as noted by many studies, \19\ 
lead to more stress on workers that negates partially or completely the 
benefit of more time off. Employee workplace safety concerns may also 
increase if safeguards are not put in place for the increased 
productivity required in a reduced workweek. Finally, requiring the 
same level of production or services could also result in employees 
``rushing'' to finish a job or project or otherwise not maintaining the 
same quality of work as previously provided in a 40-hour workweek.

Problems (Here's a long list of them), Dr. John Sullivan (April 11, 
2022). https://drjohnsullivan.com/articles/employers-beware-4-day-
workweek-creates-problems/.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        <bullet>  ``One size does not fit all''

    As noted by many commentators, a 32-hour workweek does not work for 
many types of employers. This is especially true for employers who must 
provide services to the public on a 24/7 basis or run a production 
operation, such as a refinery, without interruption. The only way 
employers could adjust to a 32-hour workweek would be to pay 
significant overtime to existing employees or hire additional workers 
(if they can even be found) to cover the lost shift hours of their 
current workforce. Accordingly, in addition to the overwhelming desire 
by employees for more flexibility in the workplace, accommodations 
would need to be made for certain industries and employers if a 32-hour 
workweek were mandated.

        <bullet>  Changes to paid time off and other benefits tied to 
        hours worked

    If an employer calculates paid time off benefits based on hours 
worked, moving to a 32-hour work week would result in fewer paid time 
off hours being earned. Other benefits tied to hours worked would also 
be reduced. It is not clear how Senator Sanders' approach would 
accommodate such benefit plans. These are but a number of benefit 
issues that would have to be addressed if the Chairman's approach were 
to be enacted. \20\

        <bullet>  Is increased productivity possible?

    A shortened workweek may not permit a worker to increase their 
productivity. For example, on an assembly line, no matter how well the 
worker performs, the line speed could remain unchanged. This would mean 
working 20 percent fewer days/hours would translate to 20 percent less 
productivity per person. \21\

    Also, consider in warehouse situations that there may be a physical 
limit on how many items employees can pick per hour or how many 
delivery locations a driver can serve in a given day. These are a few 
examples of where workers have little or no ability, as a practical 
matter, to increase their productivity. \22\

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

                                 __
                                 
                   [summary statement of roger king]
    I am appearing on behalf of the HR Policy Association where I serve 
as the Senior Labor and Employment Counsel. HR Policy is a public 
policy advocacy organization that represents the chief human resource 
officers of nearly 400 of the largest corporations doing business in 
the United States and globally. Collectively, their companies employ 
more than 10 million employees in the United States--nearly 9 percent 
of the private sector workforce.

    I want to note that the Association is not opposed to 32-hour 
workweeks or other non-traditional workweek configurations that make 
operational and financial sense for employers. We are, however, opposed 
to amending the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to change the overtime 
requirements for nonexempt employees from 40 hours to 32 hours. \1\ 
Accordingly, there is no need for government intervention in this area.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\  The Association opposes HB 1332, which would phase-in changes 
to the FLSA 40-hour overtime workweek standard to a 32-hour standard.

    It is my understanding that the Chairman's intent for holding this 
hearing today is to discuss scenarios where employees do not perform 
work for their employers for more than 4 days in a workweek, work no 
more than 32 hours in such workweek, and continue to receive the same 
amount of pay they would have received in a traditional 40-hour 
workweek setting. \2\ In my testimony I will cover the 40-hour workweek 
and FLSA origins, the potential for AI wealth dividends, and workers' 
desire for flexibility. Additionally, I will cover the unintended 
negative consequences of a federally mandated move to a 32-hour 
workweek, including increased part-time offers, reduced contributions 
to Social Security and Medicare, and reductions in benefit coverage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\  The title of this hearing states only that employees would not 
suffer a reduction in pay they are currently receiving by working a 40-
hour workweek and then moving to a 32-hour workweek. I am assuming, 
however, that Senator Sanders would also take the position that 
employees working a 32-hour workweek schedule would receive the same 
level of benefits. This is an important point as the U.S. Department of 
Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics has concluded employee benefits 
account for approximately 29.4 percent of an employee's total weekly 
payroll costs to private sector employees.

    Many articles and studies have concluded that the employee 
appreciation and support for a shortened workweek exists only for a 
short period of time. Such studies have concluded that the initial 
positive reaction by employees can fade very quickly, with 
corresponding morale, operational, and financial problems facing 
employers that move to a shortened work week. \3\

                                 ______
                                 
    The Chair. Thank you very much to all of the panelists. Let 
me just briefly respond to Mr. King's statement about letting 
the market decide who benefits from a transition to more 
advanced technology.

    For the last 50 years, the market has done just that, and 
the result has been that there has been a $50 trillion transfer 
of wealth from the bottom 90 percent to the top 1 percent. So, 
after those 50 years, there are millions of workers today who 
are worse off, while we have more income and wealth inequality 
than we have ever had in the history of the country.

    I am not quite in favor of letting the market decide. All 
right, let me begin the questioning. We are going to be a 
little bit, not to offend Senator Cassidy, a little bit liberal 
here, in terms of the time because we only have a few Members 
here and it is an important subject.

    I wanted to start off with President Fain. And I don't want 
to talk about statistics. We have heard a lot of statistics. 
You have been with the union for over three decades. No doubt 
as president, you have met thousands of workers, you have met 
thousands of retirees. Tell the American people what it is like 
to work on a factory floor. In some cases--I mean, by the way, 
I learned this recently.

    There are people today in America who are working 7 days a 
week, 12 hours a day. Unbelievable. But President Fain, talk 
about the impact on the life of a worker mentally, physically, 
who was doing work, hard work, day after day, year after year. 
What is--what happens to that person?

    Mr. Fain. Thank you. So, I find irony in some of the 
statements I just listened to, but I--so, the typical life of a 
factory worker, I mean, and this is union or not--and it is 
actually worse for nonunion workers because they have less 
rules that govern their workplace.

    But when you are--typically many factory workers, many 
typical schedules in manufacturing are 12 hour schedules, and 
they are 7 days a week. These--a lot of these places run around 
the clock.

    When you are standing on concrete floors 12 hours a day, 7 
days a week, year after year after year, there is a lot of wear 
and tear on a person's body. As I say, people in the age, they 
end up--in their older working years, end up getting knee 
replacements, hip replacements, shoulder surgeries.

    I just find an irony in some of this mentally. The stress 
of working 7 days a week, 12 hours a day, when you don't get to 
see your kids, you don't get to go home and have dinner with 
your kids, you don't get to make sure they are getting their 
homework done, you don't get to spend quality time with family.

    Or just even if you don't have a family, if you have 
quality time for yourself. You know, something is sacrificed 
when you are working 12 hours a day, either sleep or time with 
family. Something is going on--something else is sacrificed. We 
only have so much time in a day.

    But, I find that irony in some of the comments that were 
made by Mr. King. As far as a shortage of workers, I don't 
believe we have a shortage of workers in this country. I think 
COVID made people wake up and realize what is important in 
life, and it is not working for 12 hours--$12 an hour and 12 
hours a day, and multiple jobs struggling to get by.

    This shortage of workers that we see, I don't believe it is 
a shortage. I believe it is a fact that people have woken up 
and they have decided I am not going to leave my home for $12 
an hour when I can't even afford to pay the bills.

    Also, going back to that, letting the markets determine 
this and it is just an HR standard talking point about passing 
added cost onto the consumer. Well, I witnessed inflation in 
the last 4 years.

    That wasn't caused by workers. It wasn't caused by--it was 
caused by two words, corporate greed. It is consumer price 
gouging. And so, that to me--we got to get focused on the 
reality here.

    The Chair. Thank you. Dr. Schor, we are the wealthiest 
country in the history of the world and yet we have people who 
are stressed out. We have a crisis in mental health. A lot of 
factors for that.

    Yet we are working longer hours, as I understand it, than 
people of any other wealthy nation. How does that happen?

    Dr. Schor. Well, I think a lot of the reason for the long 
hours in this country have to do with the kinds of things that 
we have been talking here today and the fact that the American 
worker has not had enough power in the market to reduce hours. 
But there are other aspects as well.

    One of the things we know from economic studies is that 
when inequality increases, so do working hours. And so, the 
rise in inequality in the United States, which you referred to 
earlier, is one of the primary causes of longer working hours 
in the United States.

    The Chair. Okay. Mr. Leland, from your perspective, this 
discussion is not just theoretical. You have implemented it. 
Talk a little bit about the impact that has had, the transition 
to a 4-day work week in your company. The impact that it has 
had on the workers there.

    Mr. Leland. Yes. I mean, it has been transformative for our 
workers. I mean, I have been told that this is one of the most 
impactful things that they have experienced in their lives, 
because a lot of these workers are able to spend time with 
their kids.

    They are learning new skills. I have someone who works for 
me, learned how to use AI on those days off, and has brought it 
back into the workplace, and is much more efficient. And as a 
result, they are learning new skills that are not related to 
work but are just participating in their communities, 
volunteering.

    The Chair. We talked about increased productivity. Are 
workers more focused when they come back after 3 days?

    Mr. Leland. Yes. So, workers are much more focused. They 
are better rested. They are dedicated to the task at hand in a 
different way, and teams sit together longer. The cohesiveness 
of the organization is much more robust on a 4-day work week 
because you aren't burning people out, you aren't churning 
through them. You aren't having to deal with turnover costs.

    The Chair. Well, talk about turnover. I mean, one of the 
great cost to businesses is a lot of turnover and having to 
train new workers. What do you think the impact of a 32-hour 
work week would be on that?

    Mr. Leland. It was shocking, honestly, how much it changed 
turnover and what impact that had on our productivity. I mean, 
honestly, we have we have rarely lost an employee in the last 2 
years.

    That means people have longer tenure. We don't have to deal 
with hiring, the cost of hiring, the time of hiring someone 
else. Our goal is don't get disrupted by the sudden departure 
of a key employee. I think a 32 hour workweek--people want to 
work.

    The notion that, I don't know, Americans are lazy, that 
some people have is, I think, inaccurate. People want to work, 
but they want to work in a way that is balanced with the rest 
of their lives, and they will stay in those jobs longer if the 
job is balanced with the rest of their lives.

    The Chair. Thanks very much.

    Senator Cassidy.

    Senator Cassidy. I yield to Senator Braun.

    Senator Braun. Thank you. So, before I got here, 37 years 
spent running an enterprise that would encompass that scrappy 
navigation of how hard it is when you are signing the front 
side of a paycheck to get a little business, to ever get beyond 
that. As we grew into a regional and national company, things 
change as you evolve. And we have had discussions before.

    I am a proponent of high wages and good benefits. Been out 
there to where you ought to be able to negotiate and bargain, 
but there is such a big difference in terms of that dynamic and 
then wrapping it with mandates that would never enable most of 
what comprises our economy, which would be small businesses, 
Main Street ones, to be in a position to where they would have 
to live with some type of homogenous approach to maybe even 
what we are talking about.

    I think even for most business owners, if they can, they 
are going to weave that into what they are able to offer their 
employees. And Mr. Fain, we have had the conversation, big 
corporations that are in places where they have cornered the 
market, I think there is a legitimate discussion of how you 
spread that wealth within, between employees in public 
companies and a lot of times a professional management that 
would seem to, rake in levels of pay that I never thought were 
possible.

    I want to get back to though how I do disagree with trying 
to do anything from this place that would impose upon the 
preponderance of businesses out there to where I just don't 
think they could survive. I think that it is a legitimate issue 
to talk about voluntarily.

    If you are good at what you do and you are going to keep 
employees, you are going to want to weave it in. I think it is 
a legitimate issue to bargain for at that highest level of 
super large corporations and large workforces. I think that is 
about as far as you can go.

    Most businesses would not be like yours, Mr. Leland. There 
is more--you wouldn't be in business if you weren't open 6 days 
a week for almost any retail business I am aware of, including 
my wife's business in our downtown that has been there for now 
nearly 45 years. It just would not work.

    Keep that in mind. I want to start with this particular 
question for Dr. Vittert and Mr. King, and I want to focus on 
how this would work on Main Street and with small businesses. I 
am not worried about big corporations.

    They generally are going to land on their feet anyway, and 
I believe they ought to be negotiated with for all the things 
you might do to improve the position of a worker there. But 
what about Main Street and small business. We will start with 
you--Dr. Vittert, you start, then Mr. King.

    Dr. Vittert. [Technical problems]--exactly what you are 
saying--pardon me, sorry. I should learn that mute in Zoom, I 
should have gotten there at this point.

    I think it is really important to note that so many of 
these studies that have been done and these pilots that have 
shown incredible things, what is done at Kickstarter is 
amazing, is that it is self-selection.

    These companies are choosing to be a part of this. And so, 
they are able to cut out extraneous meetings. They are able to 
shorten coffee breaks. They are able to go to remote meetings 
for some things you don't have to commit--whatever it is.

    Senator Braun. I have never heard of anything that you have 
just mentioned in a small business.

    Dr. Vittert. Exactly.

    Senator Braun. That just is not there. We try to do it. And 
so, we don't run out of time, because I do have a final 
question for Mr. Leland, Mr. King, would you weigh in on that 
too?

    Mr. King. Senator, it is good to see you again. This 
doesn't work for small business. It doesn't work for any type 
of business if you can't measure productivity correctly and 
then have that productivity gap satisfied.

    The proposal the Chairman is putting in legislation today 
would require overtime over eight. It would require overtime 
over 32. It would require overtime, double time, in fact, over 
12. So, a small business needs to have flexibility. Employees 
have family obligations.

    They have other obligations in their community. The 
employer needs them sometimes more than eight, sometimes less. 
You know that from your business. The bill we are talking about 
here today interferes with that flexibility. It just is not 
sound policy.

    Senator Braun. Thank you. Mr. Leland, would you agree that 
your business has certain characteristics that probably made it 
peculiar to you being able to do that? Or do you honestly 
believe that would be transferable into the multitude of 
businesses, especially out on Main Street?

    Mr. Leland. Yes, no, I mean, our business definitely has 
characteristics that are not unique but lend themselves toward 
an easier transition to a 4-day workweek. However, the pilots 
that Dr. Schor has worked on show that this is possible across 
multiple industries.

    It looks different, that transformation looks different, 
but we have seen manufacturing, construction, healthcare, 
police departments all do this successfully.

    Senator Braun. Thank you.

    The Chair. Thank you.

    Senator Murphy.

    Senator Murphy. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thanks 
for convening this hearing. I think this is a really important 
conversation to have regardless of where you stand on this 
issue.

    I think, the fundamental question here that we are asking 
is where has all this wealth gone that has been gathered in 
this economy from these massive increases in productivity if it 
hasn't been going to workers, if the UAW and other unions have 
to fight tooth and nail just to be able to get living wage 
increases. I will tell you something we haven't talked about 
yet.

    A lot of that money is going to trust funds. A lot of that 
money is going into inherited wealth. And at some point, we 
should have a conversation about that a little bit more openly 
as a Committee and as a Congress.

    Here is a stunning piece of data. For the first time last 
year, the majority of wealth for new billionaires, these were 
people who became billionaires in 2023, came not from their 
work, but through inheritance.

    It's the first time ever that has happened. A thousand 
billionaires are expected to pass down $5.2 trillion worth of 
wealth to their heirs in the next 20 years, and so you hope 
that if the money isn't going to the workers, it is at least 
being recycled back into the economy. It is just not true.

    A lot of that money is being hoarded and then passed down 
to kids who in previous ages would not have been able to enjoy 
that level of benefit from their parents' success. Mr. Fain, I 
wanted to talk to you just a little bit about leisure time. You 
have talked about this already.

    You are--I think you really importantly talk about the 
importance that your faith plays in the work that you do and in 
your life. But there is a pretty wild thing happening in 
America today. In 2000, 70 percent of Americans belonged to a 
religious institution, but today, that number is 50 percent.

    This has been a pretty precipitous decline in the ability 
or willingness of Americans to go to church or to a religious 
institution on a regular basis. And I think that has lots of 
broad impacts in our society. But there are a lot of reasons 
for that. But one of them is that Americans just have less free 
time.

    When you have to work 70 hours to get the same standard of 
living for your family that 40 hours would have gotten you a 
few decades ago you don't have time to go to Wednesday night 
Bible study. You might not have the ability to even attend 
church services on a Sunday.

    You can talk about church if you want or if you don't want, 
but it is just true that some of the leisure time activities, 
some of the institutions that Americans found value and meaning 
in, are less accessible when you have to work these long hours. 
I would love to hear your thoughts on that.

    Mr. Fain. Yes. I mean, one of the biggest--it is one of the 
things we talked about with the 32 hour workweek, when we put 
that in our contract talks, was the fact that we wanted to 
create work life balance.

    Because it is just, in this country we are the most 
productive. I mean, sadly, I say not proudly, sadly we are the 
most productive nation in the world, which means our people are 
working more and more hours with less and less people, and 
something has got to give. And so, this is--it is work life 
balance.

    As I say, when you are working multiple jobs to live 
paycheck to paycheck or you are working 7 days a week, 12 hours 
a day, something else is sacrificed in that. And that is--it is 
what ends up happening.

    You have to sacrifice, your ability to go to church. If it 
is something else to do on a Sunday, maybe you get a Sunday off 
and you haven't slept all week, and you spend the whole day 
sleeping. I mean, that is a reality a lot of workers face on 
some of the schedules they work.

    The thing to me that I think, I hear all this--we have 
heard my whole life about good for business is good for people, 
trickle-down economics and all those type things. But to me, we 
have to focus--I do believe Congress has an obligation here in 
spending priorities and regulations.

    That may be an ugly word to some people that represent 
business. But, the point of this is this should be done to 
create more jobs, more jobs at a better rate of pay, so that 
people have more free time to live.

    If Government is going to invest in business the trillions 
of dollars we invest in business, that our taxpayer dollars 
invest in business, that should--those benefits should be going 
to working class people, not just strictly business.

    That is the problem. All this money goes to business, but 
it never seems to funnel its way down to benefit working class 
people.

    Senator Murphy. Well, listen, I agree with you. I think we 
should have an interest in leisure time, right. We should have 
an interest in making sure that people are able to find value 
outside of work.

    A lot of people find value in work, and I am glad that they 
do. But a lot of people find more value by the institutions and 
the social clubs and the churches that they affiliate and spend 
time with outside of work, but that is just less accessible for 
people today, and that should be a public policy interest of 
the U.S. Congress.

    I appreciate this hearing allowing us to talk about that. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

    The Chair. Thank you.

    Senator Cassidy.

    Senator Cassidy. Yes, thank you all. We have a little extra 
time. I got a lot of questions, so I will ask you all to be 
tight with your responses.

    First, Mr. Fain, I totally agree with you. My practice as a 
physician was in a hospital for the uninsured. Folks want jobs, 
and they want decent pay. I agree with that entirely. There is 
a little bit of kind of, though, confusion in what we are 
saying. I just want to put out some of that confusion.

    When you say people are working longer to make more money, 
well, if you just cut them down to 32 hours a week, they are 
still making the same money. So, for them to grow their income, 
they would have to either work overtime and, or take a second 
job. And yes, there are companies that work 24/7, but the 
people don't work 24/7.

    They work 40 hours a week, or apparently on average 41.3 
hours per week. So, I think we have to be kind of clear on 
that. And last, of course, productivity is not more hours to 
make the same money. Productivity is more work per hour.

    It is oftentimes aided by machines, in which case there is 
less wear and tear on the body. Not to say that there is not 
wear and tear on the body when we think of construction 
workers, but still, that is the whole point.

    Dr. Schor, when you mentioned that decreasing hours work 
per week increases productivity, it makes total sense to me. 
When I go to Spain and go to McDonald's, they don't have 
somebody at the front desk to take my order for a hamburger.

    They have got a machine that I push a button on, and it 
dispenses it. And our Department of Labor has said that if we 
raise minimum wage, there will be a net loss of jobs because 
people will automate in order to decrease their labor cost.

    How would--if you are speaking of a service industry, why 
would raising their labor costs by having fewer hours work per 
week for the same salary be any different than raising the 
minimum wage in terms of an incentive for net loss of jobs by 
replacing workers with automation?

    Dr. Schor. Yes. Thank you for that question. Let me just 
respond----

    Senator Cassidy. Real quick.

    Dr. Schor. Yes. Two points. One is, we are seeing no 
increase in overtime and second job holding in our studies, by 
the way. But the impacts that we are seeing here are not labor 
displacing because people are able to make up that productivity 
in the 4-days that they had in the 5-days, yes.

    Senator Cassidy. That surprises me because I--just 
intuitively I am a doctor. So, intuitively when I read about 
the Temple nurses working shorter hours.

    I will just say that according to the Pennsylvania Hospital 
Association, 30 percent of RN positions are unfilled, and 
apparently Temple University Hospital spent $55 million for 
nurse overtime during--because of a nursing shortage.

    I am not sure how to square that because they worked less 
hours, but they had to pay more for overtime and, or for 
others.

    Dr. Schor. These are for their nurse managers. Because the 
other nurses are on these like 3 day schedules and so forth. 
So, and this was put into place 2 years after the pandemic 
started.

    Senator Cassidy. The nurse managers are working less, not 
the RNs themselves.

    Dr. Schor. Correct.

    Senator Cassidy. Okay.

    Dr. Schor. They haven't--because they are not on 5 day 
schedules, so they haven't, yes----

    Senator Cassidy. I am almost out of time. I am going to 
move. Mr. Leland, right now we are trying to get a health bill. 
The best I can tell my staff is working 80 hours a week, 
because anytime they call me on a Saturday or Sunday or Monday 
on a holiday, they are fully prepared and obviously there. When 
you all got a big crunch time, deadline has to hit, boom, you 
got to move, like people still only work 32 hours?

    Mr. Leland. No. It is a norm, right. This is not pencils 
down at 32 hours. It is the question of, well, what is your 
standard workweek that you are flexing around.

    Senator Cassidy. Yes. That is all I was going to check. Dr. 
Vittert, I look at France's unemployment rate among the youth. 
It is like 17 percent. It is pretty amazing. And then for the 
next group, it is like 7 or 8 percent, much higher than ours. 
And you had mentioned--and they have got other labor laws as 
well.

    But you had mentioned that this kind of, sugar high, more 
satisfaction but then it fades and then it goes away. But also, 
that there is a loss of work as workers either go to temporary 
workers or offshore. Could you elaborate on that, please?

    Dr. Vittert. I think it is the same kind of idea as right 
when COVID hit, we are all baking bread or doing whatever we 
are doing. And then as COVID went on longer and you were at 
home more, you are sitting in your bed longer.

    It shows in the long term studies that things just go back 
to normal. We just see that happen all over again with people. 
And I think we see it clearly in terms of unemployment rates in 
the same way.

    Senator Cassidy. If you will, the other things that occur, 
the disruption in the economy, etcetera, really do more to 
dictate your happiness than whether or not you work a little 
less. Indeed, there may be a loss of a job because of this 
impact upon you.

    Dr. Vittert. That is exactly what happened in France, is 
people lost their jobs.

    Senator Cassidy. Got you. And, Mr. King, just to make the 
point, there is nothing to prevent a business like Mr. Leland 
or Temple University Hospital for a select group of employees 
to have a policy which would be 32 hours a week. So, there is 
no reason for a mandate per se. Companies can do that. Just to 
make that point.

    Mr. King. Yes, absolutely, Senator. And that is the point, 
let's give flexibility to workers and to employers. Don't have 
Government come in and intervene. It is going directly in the 
opposite position of where we should be going.

    Now, as far as the number of workers available in this 
country, I agree with Mr. Fain, we need to get more people back 
into the workforce for sure.

    But study after study shows, even if we did that, and I am 
looking at a recent U.S. Chamber of Commerce study, we would 
still have 3 million jobs open in this country. This proposal 
is going in the wrong direction. Flexibility is what we need.

    Senator Cassidy. Dr. Vittert, I am going to--Dr. Schor, 
first I want to ask you this. Think about it, to Dr. Vittert. 
You had mentioned--I didn't quite get the association versus 
causation. You say that when there is more inequality that 
there are--that people work longer hours. I didn't quite 
understand that relationship. Is that an association or a 
causation?

    Dr. Schor. It is--these are done with macroeconomic 
studies. So, we believe they are causation, but they are not 
controlled experiments. And that is----

    Senator Cassidy. Dr. Vittert, any comment?

    Dr. Vittert. If you don't have a controlled experiment you 
cannot find causation. It is just statistical--statistics.

    Senator Cassidy. Yes. I once gave a vaccine to a person who 
became pregnant. And it made me realize that, just because it 
happens at the same time, it is not a causation. It is an 
association.

    Dr. Schor. Yes. But these are highly sophisticated studies. 
And I really would disagree with the idea that we can only know 
something if we have an experiment----

    Senator Cassidy. Yes, but I don't understand intuitively 
why it would happen. But I am out of time, yes----

    Dr. Schor. Oh, because people need to work more hours to 
keep up because there is a comparative dimension to the way 
people's sense of what is----

    Senator Cassidy. Actually, the thing of milk costs more 
because somebody else is making more, but that is another 
story. Yes.

    The Chair. Senator Hickenlooper.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I have been 
looking forward all day to this just because it is such a great 
group of panel. I appreciate your--all your time and 
contribution.

    To Mr. Fain, great to see you again. Appreciate all the 
work that you did to bring up a 4-day week in the negotiations, 
but I am going to hold off on yours just because I have to 
start with Dr. Schor who was an undergraduate student while I 
was a graduate student, and somehow she hasn't aged, whereas I 
have. And I think there is an injustice there that needed to be 
pointed out but appreciate all your work and research over all 
these years on the lives people lead in various types of jobs.

    You talked a little bit about the different ways that 
people have a shorter workweek, just taking part off every day 
or a whole day, time each month off. What are some of the pros, 
and again, concisely, because I got several questions, but pros 
and cons on this.

    Dr. Schor. Yes, the majority in our studies--and thank you, 
by the way. Really wonderful to see you. Are doing full days 
off. So over 90 percent of our studies are doing full days off. 
And that seems to be a much more popular way to do this than 
shorter, daily hours. Although there is a little bit of 
variation.

    One thing we looked at in our studies was whether or not 
having three consecutive days had a bigger impact on well-
being, and we were surprised that it doesn't. In some of them, 
people are taking those Wednesdays off to get a break in the 
middle of the week.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Interesting. And better or worse for 
small businesses?

    Dr. Schor. Yes. Great question. Thank you. Over 70 percent 
of the businesses in our U.S. and Canada sample have fewer than 
25 employees. So, I think this is proving to be an especially 
appealing thing for small businesses. And it may have to do 
with higher levels of stress that they are seeing among their 
employees.

    I mean, one of the things we are seeing is the small number 
of companies who are discontinuing. We are trying to figure out 
what is common among them. And so far, the only thing we can 
see is they are not achieving the same levels of well-being 
increase that the ones who don't stop are.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Interesting, right. When I was 
Mayor--when I first became Mayor of Denver in 2003, we had the 
worst budget recession ever.

    One of the stopgap measures we did was we compelled all 
city employees to take Friday afternoons off unpaid. Needless 
to say, that was not perfect. No one likes to, when you are on 
a tight budget, to have to make a budget balanced at the end of 
the month. But people really liked it.

    To this day that is--to give people that Friday off every 
week. We saw an increase in sales at local restaurants, which 
was interesting. And other, retail sales went up. So, there is 
some accessory benefit.

    Mr. Leland, I am going to skip past you, although I can't 
tell you how excited I had the chief vision officer for 
Kickstarter because I admire so much of what you all have done. 
I am going to--I want to go to Dr. Vittert, just because I 
found compelling that she was in 2018 the coolest person in 
Scotland.

    That her television show, Liberty's Great American 
Cookbook, which is--is still showing in Scotland?

    Dr. Vittert. It is.

    Senator Hickenlooper. It still showing in Scotland, was 
something----

    Dr. Vittert. I need all the viewers I can get.

    [Laughter.]

    Senator Hickenlooper. Well, we want to make sure we don't 
miss to promote that, because when I was the Mayor and working 
through that, and I looked this up last night when I saw 
because Vittert not a common name.

    It is interesting that she seemed to the left of Mr. 
Leland, because her brother, Leland Vittert, was a journalist 
with international success, admired journalist with Fox back. 
He was based in Denver when I first became Mayor. And so, he 
schooled with--he re-educated me within the school of hard 
knocks on how to think about these things.

    Anyway, Dr. Vittert, one argument in favor of implementing 
a 32 workweek is that, these tech advancements like AI are 
going to make such a dramatic increase. How realistic do you 
think that is? And when would those productivity increases 
begin to show or begin to have a benefit?

    Dr. Vittert. I think the issue that we see here is people 
use the word AI and don't necessarily know what that means. And 
as someone who works in this space, we don't know yet what 
abilities AI is going to give us or machine learning.

    I mean, we are still trying to figure out what those words 
even really mean. So, to say that there is going to be this 
explosion of productivity and wealth, we just don't know yet. 
And no one is saying, or I am certainly not saying, it is above 
my pay grade, that people shouldn't share in that.

    But mandating a reduction to a 32 hour workweek is not the 
way to do that.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Got it. I hear that. And Mr. King, 
same question to you because I think you got a little more, 
going into AI, or on a deeper level. What is your feeling on 
that?

    Mr. King. Tremendous opportunity for everybody, absolutely. 
But the issue of distribution of wealth, the wealth dividend, 
Senator, from AI, I know that is what we are really talking 
about here.

    I would point the Committee's attention to chart one in my 
testimony. Productivity and compensation have tracked similarly 
for decades. Economists agree on that. Now, there have been 
gaps in different industries. There has been time lag, Senator, 
but the market will solve this issue.

    Mr. Fain will negotiate hard for 32 hours. I am sure. 
Others will advocate for 32 hours. We have examples that we see 
work. But let the market decide this. Don't have Congress 
impose this on employers or employees.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Got it. Great. And then, sorry--go 
over just for a minute. Mr. Fain, when you were negotiating and 
introduced this notion of a 32 hour workweek--I mean, you have 
talked firsthand with the large employers and large group of 
employees. It ultimately wasn't included in the final contract.

    But what were some of the concerns--unique concerns we 
haven't heard before that were raised by the employers? And 
what do you think it would take to get those employers to move?

    I think in terms of the 36 hour work week that we tried 
when I was Mayor of the city, it is really like a roughly a 10 
percent pay raise. Just a way to think about doing something 
like that. The level of appreciation of people having that 
Friday afternoon off was palpable. You could feel it. Anyway, 
what is your sense on that?

    Mr. Fain. Well, I think it is just--obviously I think it is 
just a fear of change or something--doing something different. 
I mean, you look at, there are studies that have been done when 
workers, especially factory workers, manufacturing, when they 
work anything after 10 hours typically is--they are not as 
productive.

    It's just the wear and tear that you go through throughout 
the day--there have been a lot of studies done on that. The 
productivity actually drops off. So, there are benefits to 
shorter working hours.

    As a person who stood on a line, as an 18 year old, I can 
vividly remember putting a part on a transmission. I would sit 
there. It is monotonous work doing it over and over and over 
and, literally after 2 hours of that, you are just--your mind 
is wandering off and imagine doing that for 12 hours a day, 7 
days a week.

    There are a lot of benefits to having some semblance of 
work life balance. But unfortunately with the advances in 
technology, the companies choose to eliminate jobs and squeeze 
more and more people, the remaining people working more and 
more hours, and that just doesn't work.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Right. I appreciate that. I have got 
many more questions, which I will throw in writing, but I yield 
back to the Chair. Thank you all again for being here.

    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Hickenlooper.

    Senator Hickenlooper. Tell him I said, hi.

    The Chair. Senator Cassidy has asked unanimous consent to 
enter into the record a number of statements. Without 
objection.

    [The following information can be found on page 52 in 
Additional Material:]

    The Chair. Mr. King, you can inform your clients that my 
legislation probably will not be passing tomorrow.

    Mr. King. Okay. Thank you. They will be glad to hear that.

    The Chair. I am sure they will. But the point of this 
hearing is to try to raise, at the congressional level, 
something that has not been discussed here for decades after 
decades. And I think, as all of us have understood, we are 
living in a difficult moment in American history.

    We have more income and wealth inequality than we have ever 
had before. Senator Murphy made the interesting point that for 
the billionaire class, now a majority of that wealth is being 
not earned by any case, but being transferred to children--
unearned income, if you like.

    We are seeing CEOs making 350 times more than their 
workers, while 60 percent of the people in America are living 
paycheck to paycheck. We have the highest level of childhood 
poverty of almost any major country on earth. Many of our older 
people finding it hard to retire.

    We have got to start asking some fundamental questions. 
This is an extraordinarily wealthy country, but three people on 
top as Mr. Fain mentioned, own more wealth than the bottom half 
of American society. According to the RAND Corporation, over 
the last 50 years--and RAND Corporation is not exactly a 
socialist organization.

    Over the last 50 years, $50 trillion has gone from the 
bottom 90 percent to the top 1 percent. So, in the wealthiest 
country in the history of the world, the vast majority of the 
people are struggling to put food on the table or living under 
incredible stress. Our life expectancy is significantly lower, 
as you know, than other countries.

    For working class people, if you are working class in this 
country, you are going to live 10 years fewer than you will if 
you are upper class. These are issues that have got to be 
discussed. I am not suggesting that a 32-hour workweek is going 
to change all of that, but one of the issues that we have got 
to talk about is stress in this country.

    The fact that so many people are going to work exhausted, 
physically and mentally. And the fact that we have not changed 
the Fair Labor Standards Act. This was in 1940, we came up with 
the 40 hour workweek--1940.

    Who is going to deny that the economy has not fundamentally 
and radically changed over that period of time? So, to suggest 
that we have to maintain what we put in place 84 years ago does 
not make a lot of sense to me.

    Let me just conclude by thanking all of our excellent 
panelists. It has been a good discussion. I hope the discussion 
continues and thank you all very much for being here today. For 
any Senators who wish to ask additional questions, questions 
for the record will be due in ten business days.

    I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record two 
statements in support of shortend workweeks, including a 
statement from Congressman Takano and business owners across 
the country.

                          ADDITIONAL MATERIAL

                   the honorable mark takano (ca-39)
    As the lead sponsor of the Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act in the 
House and as a Senior Member of the House Committee on Education and 
the Workforce, one of my top priorities has long been to ensure the 
quality of life and pay for workers while broadly seeking to modernize 
the structure of our workforce.

    For decades, workers have been working longer hours while 
productivity has skyrocketed and wages have remained stagnant. On 
average, workers in the United States work 200 more hours per year than 
comparable workers in other developed countries. The COVID-19 pandemic 
only further exacerbated the need to have conversations about the 
future of work, and more workers today are now reimagining their 
relationship to labor. As we emerge from the pandemic, workers are 
clear-eyed on the need for better work-life balance and fairer 
compensation. Workers want more time for leisure and with loved ones, 
and now seek to challenge the status quo of long hours with low pay 
that defined the pre-COVID era. We are currently in the midst of a 
rapidly evolving labor market and our laws need to be responsive to 
that change.

    This is why during the 117th Congress, I first introduced the 
Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act 
(FLSA) to reduce the standard workweek from 40 hours to 32 hours for 
non-exempt employees. The bill's intent is to grow additional work 
sharing and labor market participation, thereby creating healthier 
competition in the workplace to empower workers to negotiate better 
wages and working conditions. Outside of the legislative space, the 
introduction of this legislation has catalyzed robust conversations 
about the modern workplace.

    Pilot studies on both a domestic and international scale have 
yielded positive outcomes. Workers who have benefited from reduced 
workweek trials have cited increased happiness, strengthened 
productivity, and achieved a more tenable work-life balance. Congress 
must seize this historic opportunity to memorialize the gains that 
workers have achieved in this new environment. At a time when the 
nature of work is rapidly changing, it is incumbent upon us to ensuring 
our labor market prioritizes productivity, fair pay, and an improved 
quality of life for workers--not merely profits for the biggest 
corporations and wealthiest shareholders.

    Furthermore, the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) will 
have far reaching ramifications across the economy. Even in the 
technology's infancy, we are witnessing transformative changes, and 
questions remain about its impacts and how we can use AI to restructure 
our workforce and redefine the typical workweek.

    It is abundantly clear that the United States is at another 
inflection point. Will Congress respond to the demands and needs of the 
everyday worker? Or rigidly adhere to an outdated model that has 
unfairly tipped the scales of power in favor of capital holders and the 
rich? This legislation would achieve the former, and I call on Congress 
to take deliberate action to move this legislation and other bills that 
are responsive to the needs of workers.

    Thank you to Chairman Sanders and Ranking Member Cassidy for the 
opportunity to submit this testimony. I look forward to building on the 
progress to help lift up all workers, regardless of their income or 
background.
                                 ______
                                 
         letter to policymakers in support of shorter workweeks
    We are executives and organizations who have adopted a shorter 
workweek with no reduction in pay, and we represent a range of 
industries, from tech, healthcare, finance, nonprofit, government, 
manufacturing, and more. We write to you today to urge policymakers to 
explore and enact legislation that supports the transition toward a 
shorter 32-hour workweek with no decreases in pay. We have seen 
firsthand how transformative a shorter workweek can be for workers and 
employers and thus believe policymakers should advance legislation to 
pilot, facilitate, research, and ultimately adopt the widespread 
implementation of a shorter workweek.

    The 40-hour workweek has been the assumed standard for close to 100 
years. \1\ We are long overdue for an update. Since the adoption of the 
5-day workweek, our economy and culture have undergone transformational 
changes. Technology has increased productivity and connectivity at the 
workplace, women have entered the workforce in great numbers, \2\ and 
an epidemic of burnout and stress has emerged. \3\ Yet, despite these 
radical shifts in how and where we work, the length of the workweek has 
not budged. It is time to rethink the workweek, especially as we 
prepare for the rapid emergence of artificial intelligence that offers 
the potential to drive transformative productivity gains and 
efficiencies for organizations. Embracing a shorter workweek can bring 
about numerous benefits for employers, workers, and society as a whole.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    For Workers:

        <bullet>  Improved Work-Life Balance and Well-being: A shorter 
        workweek allows employees to better balance their professional 
        responsibilities with personal and family commitments, as 
        evidenced by employees at companies with 4-day workweeks 
        reporting significantly lower levels of burnout (9 percent) 
        when compared to employees at companies with typical 40-hour 
        workweek schedules (42 percent). \7\ Shorter workweeks lead to

        <bullet>  Increased Time to Care for Loved Ones: A shorter 
        workweek promotes equitable practices for groups such as 
        caregivers. \8\ There are considerable childcare, healthcare, 
        eldercare, and other costs to families who have to spend time 
        caregiving. A shorter workweek acknowledges the value of 
        caregiving time and validates the experience of caregivers by 
        providing more spaciousness and flexibility to tend to a 
        variety of responsibilities.

        time outside of work, employees can pursue hobbies, further 
        their education, or engage in community activities. This not 
        only enriches their lives but also fosters personal growth and 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        fulfillment.

    For Society:

        <bullet>  Economic Stimulus: A shorter workweek can stimulate 
        economic activity by spreading employment opportunities across 
        more workers. \9\ This can help address unemployment and 
        underemployment issues while boosting consumer spending.

        <bullet>  Social Equity: Shorter workweeks promote equality by 
        ensuring that all members of our society can tap into the 
        benefits of a shorter workweek rather than exacerbating 
        existing disparities among groups such as hourly workers, 
        unionized workers, or industries such as the care economy. This 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        helps create a more inclusive and cohesive society.

    Our economy and society have changed; so must our workweek. We urge 
policymakers to consider and support legislation that facilitates the 
transition to a 4-day workweek, paving the way for a more prosperous, 
healthy, and balanced future.

   a 4-day workweek would destroy everything that made america great
                By Liberty Vittert, Opinion Contributor
    For some people, the 4-day workweek is the new dream.

    This measure, supposedly a panacea for employee satisfaction, even 
found its way into the United Auto Workers' demands in their contract 
talks. Liberal bastions such as Massachusetts and California have 
pushed bills upon businesses to adopt a 4-day work week.

    We may not see it yet, but this measure threatens to undo 
everything that made our Nation's current prosperity possible.

    America was built on a 6-day workweek. The 5-day week originated 
nearly a century ago with Henry Ford, who used it to remove incentives 
for his employees at Ford to unionize.

    The argument for the 4-day workweek is much more tendentious, 
making broad claims based on weak and flawed data sets.

    Story after story in the media expounds upon how much ``less 
stressed'' employees are with a 4-day workweek. At the risk of sounding 
pedantic, well, duh! Of course less work means less stress. Work is 
stressful, as any working person can tell you. But stress is part of 
life. You will never be stress-free until you're dead. Has any society 
or economy grown or possessed any dynamism while everyone was lying in 
hammocks?

    Given that so many news stories are making such expansive claims 
about how beneficial this is, why aren't more companies doing it? Why 
is it that the number of 4-day-a-week jobs has not changed in the last 
3 years?

    The short answer is that it just doesn't work. A more complex 
answer is that it isn't good for those employees' companies. And if you 
want to see those same employees really stressed out, just see what 
happens when their employers lay them off or shut their doors due to 
falling productivity or lost profits.

    Most of the studies behind this fad, extolling the benefits of 
shorter hours, are self-reported. In other words, employees are the 
ones saying they are less stressed and more productive. These data are 
not based on company revenue or any other objective metric.

    It's also worth mentioning that Japan already tried this. From 1988 
to 1996, Japan shortened the workweek from 46 to 30 hours. The result 
was not ambiguous: Economic output fell by 20 percent.

    But let's take a closer look at the studies cited to support the 
shorter 4-day week. Iceland did something similar when it shortened 
health care workers' hours on a trial basis starting in 2015. The 
results were blasted all over the headlines (especially during and 
after COVID). Some are now calling it an ``overwhelming success'' for 
the 4-day workweek.

    Two think tanks that heavily shill for the 4-day week base their 
case on this study. But the first thing to note is that this study 
didn't actually test a 4-day week at all. Rather, it shortened their 
overall hours in a 5-day week. The trial included only about 1 percent 
of that tiny nation's workforce, and (no shocker here) it showed that 
employee well-being did increase with a reduction in working hours. But 
it was a complete mess for the employers. The Icelandic government had 
to shell out almost $30 million extra each year to hire more health 
care workers because of the experiment.

    Microsoft also tested a 4-day workweek by shutting down its Japan 
office every Friday during the month of August. The claim is that this 
resulted in a 40 percent increase in productivity. But if that's true, 
then why aren't they doing this everywhere Microsoft operates? Again, 
the answer is simple: Productivity increased over a very short period 
of time during a low-productivity summer month, when overall 
productivity was already at a 75-year low.

    In all fairness, who doesn't want to work 80 percent of the hours 
for 100 percent of the salary and benefits? But the problem is that the 
4-day week doesn't work for the bottom line, no matter how much the 
media or employees would like it to.

    For any customer-facing business, a 4-day week would be a 
nightmare. If your company is open only 4 days a week, or if it has 
significantly reduced operations 1 day each week, then how do people 
reach your staff? The result is that companies have to hire more staff, 
which in turn raises costs.

    We built this Nation and got ahead working six or six-and-a-half 
days a week. The countries that are now competing against us have 
essentially 7-day work weeks, and they are rapidly catching up to us.

    If American companies bow to pressure and embrace this new think-
tank-driven fad, we are going to have a real challenge on our hands 
when it comes to competing with our adversaries.

Hon. Bernie Sanders, Chair,
Hon. Bill Cassidy, Ranking Member,
U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions,
Washington, DC.

    Dear Chair Sanders and Ranking Member Cassidy:

    The undersigned organizations write to express our concerns with 
the ``Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act.'' The bill's provisions would 
exacerbate the current worker shortage and dramatically increase 
inflationary pressures. The result would be a deterioration in spending 
power for American families, a decline in the availability of goods and 
services--including critical services--and diminished competitiveness 
internationally.

    Reducing the standard workweek from 40 to 32 hours would result in 
a decline in productivity. Companies would have to adjust by finding 
additional workers, increasing prices to account for increased labor 
costs, and producing fewer goods and services. Consumers would feel the 
impact as costs increase and services are reduced across industries, 
including construction, retail, and hospitality and critical services, 
such as childcare, education, healthcare, government, and security. 
Many of these industries require worker coverage 24 hours a day and 7 
days a week and already struggle to meet demands. To cover the lost 
work hours, industries would need to hire more labor, which is already 
a challenge due to the existing significant labor shortage. There are 
currently 1.4 job openings for every unemployed worker in the U.S. \1\ 
In January 2024, the Health Care and Social Assistance and Leisure and 
Hospitality industries alone had 1.9 and 1.1 million open jobs, 
respectively. \2\ The inevitable result of this bill would be fewer 
services and increased prices for consumers at a time when is inflation 
is already high. \3\

                         QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

        Response by Juliet Schor to Questions of Senator Cassidy
                            senator cassidy
    Question 1. The companies that voluntarily participated in your 
study are traditionally white-collar industries rather than occupations 
requiring more physical work. Productivity gains achieved through 
advancing technology allowed the reduction in hours worked. How does 
that apply to professions that require manual labor?

    Answer 1. Although most of the companies in our studies are in 
white-collar industries, not all are. Eight percent are in construction 
and manufacturing. We also have restaurants (1 percent) and health care 
companies (6 percent). The largest organization in our study, a 1000 
person health care company, had such a successful experience they told 
us they are expanding the 4-day week to all 5000 of their employees. 
The productivity improvements that companies reported are due to 
multiple factors, not just advanced technologies. Many find that 
changes to their meetings practices, fewer interruptions, and more 
advance planning free up time. Some report that when their employees 
are better rested and less stressed they are more productive. Employees 
self-report higher productivity.

    Question 2. Your testimony noted several companies around the world 
that have transitioned to a 4-day, 32-hour workweek. Were any of these 
transitions as a result of a government mandate, or did employers 
voluntarily adopt a shorter workweek?

    Answer 2. All of the organizations in our early waves did this 
without a government mandate. However, there are now governments that 
are sponsoring trials, and we are involved with the Portuguese and 
Scottish national trials. In those trials, companies join voluntarily.

    Question 3. Chairman Sanders argues that the United Kingdom's 4-day 
workweek pilot program of 3000 workers at more than 60 companies was a 
``huge success.'' \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\  Production line workers are estimated at 145,823 in 2021. 
https://www.zippia.com/production-line-jobs/demographics/. Total 
employment in the U.S. was 161 million in February 2024.

    Question 3(a). Did the 4-day workweek pilot program consist of 8-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
hour days or 10-hour days?

    Answer 3(a). There are no 10 hour day companies in our studies. The 
vast majority are on 8 hour schedules, however, there are a few who 
offer some employees five shorter days or flexible reduced-hour 
schedules. All companies in the trials must offer reduced hours of work 
with no reduction in pay.

    Question 3(b). If the 4-day workweek was so successful, why did 9 
percent of businesses not continue the shorter workweek?

    Answer 3(b). There are a variety of reasons that a small number of 
companies did not continue. There is no common reason. One company was 
taken over by a private equity firm that canceled it without 
explanation. For a few their inability to identify metrics for success 
led to a pause or an end to the 4-day week. A few were very small 
entities (4-10 employees) for whom limited staff capacity led to their 
ending the new schedule. One ended the 4-day week when half their team 
went on maternity leave. The other (a retail shop) decided they wanted 
to stay open 5 days. There were a few for whom downturns in business 
were the reason. In one or two other cases, it seems they lacked 
capacity to meet orders. Quite a few of the companies in our trials are 
growing rapidly and keeping up with demand can be challenging.

    Question 3(c). What types of companies participated in the UK pilot 
program? Were there any manufacturing companies that use assembly 
lines?

    Answer 3(c). The UK program had companies from a wide variety of 
industries (see Figure 1 below). Marketing and advertising (18 percent) 
was the largest group, followed by professional services (16 percent). 
Finance and insurance was 9 percent and healthcare and social insurance 
was also 9 percent. Manufacturing companies were 7 percent of the 
total, and construction and housing were 4 percent. To my knowledge 
there were no companies with assembly lines. In the U.S., only .09 
percent of workers currently work on assembly lines.

       Response by Shawn Fain to Questions of Senator Cassidy
                            senator cassidy
    Question 1. Is it true that some of your members work 10-, 12-, and 
15-hour shifts for as many as 90 days in a row? If so, and Congress 
moved to a 32-hour workweek, wouldn't it make sense for your members to 
continue to work the same number of days to collect additional 
overtime?

    Answer 1. UAW members at Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis work 
varying work schedules, including long shifts. Working people don't 
need more overtime, we need more time for ourselves and with our 
families. When our members look back on their lives, they never say ``I 
wish I had worked more.'' They never say, ``I wish I'd made more 
money.'' They say, ``I wish I had more time.''

    Question 2. The premise of this hearing is that employees do not 
see the benefits of technology in the workplace. Since 2006, the Mine 
Act requires mine operators to track miners working underground so that 
in an emergency their last known location is recorded. Do you agree 
that this type of technology benefits miners?

    Question 2(a). Can you identify other advanced technologies that 
benefit employees?

    Answer 2(a). The UAW does not currently represent workers subject 
to the Mine Act. We defer you to our brothers and sisters at the UMWA 
for their opinion on what would benefit miners. Any technology that 
increases productivity--whether automation, artificial intelligence, or 
regular improvements in the production line--must be deployed to the 
benefit of the workers who build the products and contribute their 
labor.

    Question 2(b). How would a Federal 32-hour workweek mandate impact 
your current contracts?

    Question 2(c). Would you need to renegotiate the current contract 
with the Big Three?

    Answer 2(b). Federal legislation moving the workweek from 40 to 32-
hours with no reduction in pay would raise standards at work for all 
working people.

    Answer 2(c). Our contracts with Ford, General Motors, and 
Stellantis will remain in effect until May 1, 2028, regardless of 
changes in Federal employment law.
         Response by Jon Leland to Questions of Senator Cassidy
                            senator cassidy
    Question 1. When does your company start to pay your employees 
overtime?

    Answer 1. We do not currently employ any hourly wage workers, so we 
do not pay overtime. However, we do offer comp time to our salaried 
employees when they work over 32-hours in a workweek.

    Question 2. Can you describe what steps Kickstarter had to take to 
transition to a 32-hour workweek?

    Answer 2. We instituted organization-wide policies to eliminate or 
reduce meetings and provided clear performance expectations for each 
team that they had to maintain with a 32-hour workweek. At the team 
level, we worked with managers to identify and eliminate low impact 
work or opportunities to gain efficiencies in their processes. This 
looked different for every function as teams like engineering, sales, 
and customer support very different types of labor that required 
different adaptations. For functions like engineering, we improved our 
processes around project requirements and scoping to reduce ambiguity 
and alignment challenges that tended to slow down work. For customer 
support, we developed a richer set of pre-written and implemented 
artificial intelligence assistance to speed up our ability to respond 
to customer requests while maintaining the same level of user 
satisfaction. We reduced our vacation days proportionately (from 20 
days to 16) and we determined that we needed to maintain the 4-day 
workweek even when there was a holiday, so while we typically work 
Monday to Thursday, we switch to a Tuesday to Friday schedule when 
Monday is a holiday.

    Question 2(a). Would you agree that there are business models 
incapable of cutting meetings or using artificial intelligence to 
adjust for a 32-hour workweek?

    Answer 2(a). While there are business models incapable of primarily 
relying on cutting meetings or using artificial intelligence to adjust 
to a 32-hour workweek, there are typically other adjustments those 
employers can and have made to successfully make the transition.

    Question 2(b). How would you propose that those types of businesses 
manage the transition?

    Answer 2(b). No matter the industry, overall organizational 
productivity is not simply a factor of the number of hours worked. 
Efficiency, focus, employee quality, and retention are equally or more 
critical factors. It is simply a fact that a lot of time at work is not 
used effectively. I can't articulate all the ways that companies across 
different sectors manage the transition to a 4-day workweek, but there 
are success stories from a number of industries where cutting meetings 
or using artificial intelligence are not impactful, including 
manufacturing, healthcare, restaurants, and pest control. While exact 
implementations vary, the common thread is that maintaining a well-
rested and focused workforce working a 32-hour workweek is more 
effective than trying to maintain a burned out and high turnover 
workforce on a 40-hour workweek.

         Response by Roger King to Questions of Senator Cassidy
                            senator cassidy
    Question 1. Requiring employers to pay employees for 40 hours when 
they work only 32 would put Congress in the position of having to 
legislate the wage for each position in the workforce, or mandate that 
no business could ever reduce any worker's salary. Does Congress have 
that power?

    Answer 1. It is questionable whether Congress has the authority to 
legislate wage structures for private sector employers covered by the 
NLRA. While there is statutory and constitutional authority for 
Congress to enact minimum wage statutes and also statutory protections 
for minors in the workplace, I am not aware of any statutory or 
constitutional authority for Congress to indirectly or directly 
establish wage schedules for all of an employer's employees. Stated 
alternatively, Senator Sanders' proposal would require an employer to 
establish a new wage structure for all employees and positions that 
were initially impacted by a conversion from a 40-hour to a 32-hour 
work week. This approach would establish ``minimum wages'' for all 
impacted positions and employees and have a corresponding impact on the 
entirety of an employers' wage structure. Further, this approach would 
prohibit an employer from ever decreasing the rate of pay and benefits 
for such impacted positions. Again, I am not aware of any authority 
that Congress may have to require an employer to adopt such a wage 
schedule.

    Question 1(a). Would Senator Sanders' legislative proposal protect 
workers hired after implementation from earning less than their peers?

    Answer 1(a). It is unclear as to the ``longevity'' of Senator 
Sanders' proposal regarding impacted positions and employees converting 
from a 40-hour to a 32-hour work week. How long would such a 
requirement remain in place? It is also not clear whether employees not 
initially covered by such a conversion but who were later placed in the 
initially converted positions would be covered by Senator Sanders' 
``hold harmless'' wage and benefit requirement. Further, it is not 
clear whether Senator Sanders' proposal would also require an amendment 
to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) as his proposal 
also requires a hold harmless approach to benefits. In summary, there 
are more questions than answers with respect to Senator Sanders' hold 
harmless approach.

    Question 2. If Congress mandates a 32-hour workweek, what would be 
the impact on employer-sponsored health insurance? Would employers be 
incentivized to reduce workweeks to 20 or 30 hours so they don't have 
to provide health insurance?

    Answer 2. As stated in my testimony, it is quite probable that 
Senator Sanders' approach to require a maintenance of benefits for 
employees converting from a 40-hour to a 32-hour work week could have a 
number of adverse consequences to an employer's health benefit plans. 
Specifically, healthcare benefit contributions by employers are often 
tied to the number of hours worked by an employee in a work week. 
Employees who would have their work week hours reduced would 
potentially either suffer a reduction in healthcare coverage or have 
such coverage eliminated altogether. Even assuming that Senator Sanders 
could lawfully mandate no such negative impact upon employees as their 
work week hours are reduced, there would be benefit contribution 
issues. For example, an employer would be forced to increase the amount 
of its hourly contribution rate for the benefit plans in question or 
make other adjustments given the fact that employees would be working 
fewer hours in a work week. Even if Congress has this authority, how 
long would such a mandate be effective, particularly for new employees 
coming into positions that were initially covered by the reduced work 
week and salary and benefit hold harmless provisions? Would it only be 
effective for those employees and positions that were initially 
impacted by the reduction in the number of hours worked in a work week? 
The financial and operational impact of such ``hold harmless'' benefit 
coverage should be closely scrutinized with appropriate in-depth 
studies.

    Question 3. The Biden administration is proposing to increase the 
overtime threshold to $55,068, a 55 percent increase from the level set 
in 2020. Can you describe how this change, in addition to an adjustment 
to the standard 40-hour workweek and an increase in the minimum wage, 
would impact businesses of all sizes?

    Answer 3. Pursuant to Senator Sanders' approach employers will be 
adversely impacted in three ways. First, Senator Sanders' proposal 
would require the establishment of a new increased base rate that would 
be utilized for overtime pay calculations. This new rate would have to 
be applied to determine the amount of overtime rate of pay. In every 
instance, the amount of overtime pay would increase considerably. 
Second, there would be a considerable increase in the number of non-
exempt employees eligible for overtime, pursuant to the Biden 
administration's proposal to increase the hourly salary/wage threshold. 
Accordingly, there would be more employees receiving overtime pay at a 
higher overtime rate. Third, employers, in manyinstances, will have to 
increase the amount of overtime in a work week to compensate for the 
loss of work week hours thereby increasing their overall payroll cost. 
When you combine all three of these adverse impacts on employers, it 
may be financially difficult for a business to continue to operate or, 
in the alternative, it would operate with a substantial reduction in 
its work force and/or a conversion of full-time jobs to part-time jobs. 
Finally, to the extent an employer could navigate such considerable 
wage increases in its payroll cost, in most instances it would have to 
pass on this added cost of doing business to consumers, thereby further 
increasing inflationary pressures on our economy.

    Question 4. Senator Sanders recently introduced his ``Thirty-Two 
Hour Workweek Act.'' It appears that it would have the potential to 
decrease by as much as 20 percent the amount companies would pay into a 
defined benefit plan until the next collective bargaining agreement 
(CBA) is consummated. Is this correct? What would be the financial 
impact of this on these plans?

    The impact of Senator Sanders' proposal on defined benefit for both 
union and nonunion employers could be considerable. For example, an 
employer's benefit contribution obligation, in many instances, is to 
provide contributions on an hours-worked basis. Assuming employees 
reduced their hours worked in a work week, the employer's corresponding 
benefit contribution obligation--absent a renegotiation of the 
applicable plan requirements--could be considerably impacted. This 
issue of employer benefit contribution is another aspect of the 32-hour 
work week that will have to be carefully analyzed. Further, have the 
ERISA implications from a statutory amendment perspective been fully 
considered? Finally, if employer benefit contributions are 
significantly decreased, benefit plans would also be adversely 
impacted. Indeed, perhaps a number of benefit plans would have to 
greatly curtail their healthcare benefits coverage or cease to exist 
altogether. Any such negative consequences for employer healthcare 
plans could have a corresponding adverse impact on the nation's 
healthcare network and correspondingly increase the need for more 
governmental Medicare and Medicaid assistance.

      Response by Liberty Vittert to Questions of Senator Cassidy
                            senator cassidy
    Question 1. You have examined various 32-hour workweek studies. 
What are your conclusions about the impact of a shortened workweek on 
businesses and workers?

    Answer 1. There are significant statistical flaws in all of the 
studies I have examined and are regularly touted as proof of concept 
for the shortened work week. There are also many overlooked studies 
that show the true detriment to both the workers and the economy of the 
country.

    First, productivity does not necessarily increase with a shortened 
work week in the longterm. Besides the issue of defining exactly what 
productivity or success means in different companies or countries, we 
have seen in multiple studies that long-term there is a significant 
decrease in productivity as measured by the country's GDP (a study in 
Japan run from 1988 to 1996) where economic output fell by 20 percent 
after a significant reduction in working hours.

    Second, there is a large self-selection issue of companies 
participating in these studies such as with the 4 Day Week Global 
study. The companies are choosing to participate, potentially meaning 
that they are small and trying to grow (enticing new workers) or are 
capable of reducing hours by removing extraneous meetings, coffee 
breaks etc., a point made by the study conductors themselves. Given 
that 75 percent of the workforce in the United States works with their 
hands, there are no extraneous meetings to cut out.

    Third, a study in Iceland that is widely cited as a measure of the 
success of the shortened work week, fails to mention that the Icelandic 
government had to expend almost $30 million extra to hire more 
healthcare workers because of the experiment. This is also the case 
with a study in Spain where companies that participate in the pilot 
were also eligible for a multi-million dollar government fund to help 
subsidize.

    Fourth, the concept that this reduction in hours will automatically 
increase happiness and decrease stress long-term is statistically 
flawed. For example, in France, the government mandated the reduction 
of the standard work week from 39 hours to 35 hours. There was no 
evidence that this increased workers' happiness and in fact, decreased 
it, due to the need of companies to hire part-time, cheaper, workers. 
Should workers not have jobs, or have to work two jobs since with this 
plan companies are incentivized to hire part-time workers instead, 
stress and unhappiness will surely increase.

    Question 2. If all it takes to transition to a 32-hour workweek is 
reducing meetings and streamlining processes as mentioned in Mr. 
Leland's testimony, why haven't all companies or all economies moved to 
a shortened workweek?

    It is specifically only companies that are able to adapt to a 
shorter workweek that tend to participate by cutting out, as they say, 
extraneous meetings, coffee breaks, or having more independent work. 
However, over 75 percent of the U.S. job economy is people working with 
their hands, they don't have extraneous meetings or too many coffee 
breaks to cut out. Statistically, you cannot apply this type of cutting 
across all types of companies, which is necessary for any kind of 
successful reduction in work hours.

    Also, given the types of companies that are potentially capable of 
cutting their work week, we could see a divide of the rich getting 
richer (or working less time) and the poor needing to take on part time 
jobs. We also disadvantage older workers who cannot necessarily 
physically do the same amount of work in a shorter time, which happened 
to great detriment to that population during the Great Depression.

    Question 2(a). Is this sustainable in 24-hour industries?

    No, it is not. It will be devastating to companies economically and 
even if they can do it, it will encourage them to hire part-time 
workers instead of full time workers leading to stereotypically lower 
pay and less benefits.

    Question 3. In an op/ed piece for The Washington Post, Chairman 
Sanders touted Belgium, France, Norway, and Denmark as positive 
evidence for mandating a 32-hour workweek in the United States. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\  https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/03/19/32-hour-
work-week-sanders-fain/.

    Question 3(a). What was the impact on economic output in each of 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
these countries?

    Answer 3(a). They did not mandate necessarily a 32 hour work week, 
some did 36 hours or some did a shortened work week but the same amount 
of hours so using these as evidence is not an apples to apples 
comparison. There were also huge issues for employees is some of these 
countries with layoffs due to this implementation. Also, for a lot of 
these studies there were enormous government subsidies to allow this to 
happen.

    Question 3(b). Long term, do workers sustain the same level of 
satisfaction popular studies have noted?

    Answer 3(b). Many of the news headlines touting these studies 
discuss the stress or happiness levels of workers who work less time. 
Inevitably, over the short term, in these short pilot projects, it is 
not inconceivable to imagine that happiness levels increase--the 
question is where does the pendulum end--at no work? Statistical 
studies show that it doesn't actually matter if we decrease the work 
time in the long run--workers' happiness fails to improve over the 
long-term studies we have that are often ignored by proponents. For 
example, the study in France, after mandatory government reduction of 
hours saw a return to the same level of happiness after 7 years.

    If you want to see those same employees really stressed out, just 
see what happens when their employers lay them off for part-time 
workers that generally take lower pay and less benefits or even shut 
their doors due to falling productivity or lost profits.

    Question 4 Chairman Sanders also noted that in 2019, Microsoft 
tested a 4-day workweek in Japan and reported a 40 percent increase in 
productivity. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\  Ibid.

    Question 4(a). Was the 4-day workweek at Microsoft in Japan 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
successful?

    Answer 4(a). It was not successful in any statistically meaningful 
manner. Microsoft tested a four-day work week by shutting down its 
Japan office every Friday during the month of August. The claim is that 
this resulted in a 40 percent increase in productivity. This is a 
statistical fallacy that correlation does not necessarily mean 
causation. Productivity increased over a very, very short period of 
time during a low-productivity summer month, when overall productivity 
was already at a 75-year low.

    There is no statistical evidence to merit a nationwide mandate of a 
32 hour work week and, in fact, clear evidence against it. If it works 
for some companies in some sectors, then great, but it will be highly 
detrimental to the majority.

    Question 4(b). Why hasn't Microsoft implemented the 4-day workweek 
worldwide?

    Answer 4(b). Because it was clearly not successful in any 
statistically meaningful way.
