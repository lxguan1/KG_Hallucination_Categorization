 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRETT GUTHRIE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
           CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY

    This is the fourth hearing the Energy and Commerce 
Committee has held in the 118th Congress related to our 
response framework. I want to express, you know, concern and 
disappointment today that the bill before us, PAHPA, is not 
bipartisan as we now speak. I know that we have worked hard to 
try to make it that way. Hopefully, we will, as we move 
forward. And I look forward to engaging my colleagues on 
systematic CDC reforms and comprehensive effort to examine the 
root causes of the drug shortage that we are now facing, which 
is serious, absolutely serious.
    I am grateful to Representative Miller-Meeks for taking the 
lead on CDC reform by publicly issuing a request for 
information on this issue. I look forward to hearing from her 
about the responses she receives from her RFI and addressing 
the many issues highlighted in a future CDC reform effort. We 
will start these conversations today, and we will have to--work 
to do across the Health Subcommittee's jurisdiction that 
necessitates a separate process and larger conversation outside 
the scope of this authorization.
    So hopefully we can go back to focusing on this 
authorization, and I look forward to working together on the 
other issues that have arisen the last few days.
    The legislation before us today is designed to generate 
broad consensus around streamlining improvements to our 
preparedness and response infrastructure at the Administration 
for Strategic Preparedness and Response, or ASPR. We are 
continuing our efforts to prepare for and respond more 
effectively to future public health security threats. These 
threats include chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or 
cyber attacks or any infectious disease outbreak.
    Many of the bills today are bipartisan. This includes 
legislation focused on evaluating and shoring up our diagnostic 
testing infrastructure and domestic manufacturing capacity for 
medical countermeasures during a public health emergency. These 
two components hampered our initial response to the COVID-19 
pandemic.
    We also have several pieces of legislation focused on 
improvements to our National Strategic Stockpile. This includes 
reaffirming our commitment to supporting States' efforts, 
working to ensure streamlined insight into our stockpile supply 
chain, and clarifying ASPR's responsibility over the Strategic 
National Stockpile.
    We are considering legislation to improve transparency and 
communication between our Federal agencies and private-sector 
partners. For example, we are examining the benefits of 
establishing an advisory committee to provide a forum for 
private-sector input into our medical countermeasures 
procurement.
    We must also demand proper accountability and communication 
from our public health agencies to our constituents. That is 
why I am pleased to see Chair Rodgers' discussion draft to 
require CDC to issue good guidance practices included in the 
hearing today. This would establish public participation 
requirements prior to finalization or implementation of major 
guidance pushed out by the CDC.
    It also clarifies that these guidances are nonbinding and 
do not create, restrict, or revoke any person's rights or 
responsibility. This also does not have the force or effect of 
law, which is a standard that other public health agencies 
already must meet.
    The public deserves to have visibility and a seat at the 
table to allow them to make decisions best for themselves and 
their families.
    To build on the importance of accountability and improved 
processes, I am to partner with Representative Peters on 
bipartisan legislation to examine the Department of Health and 
Human Services' existing data authorities and data collection 
efforts. This includes the Federal funds used for such 
purposes.
    Local authorities don't need new, top-down, heavy-handed 
data-sharing mandates that won't help them respond to their 
local needs, nor should the American people's sensitive 
information be collected and potentially used in a punitive 
fashion. This bill will ensure the agency is held accountable 
for any overutilization of such authorities, including any 
redundancies. We have already heard from stakeholders on how 
important this review is, and hopefully we can move forward--
hopefully move it forward as part of this process.
    In closing, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to 
Representative Hudson, his staff, and our dedicated committee 
staff for their work over the past several months to deliver 
this strong discussion draft. We must ensure these critical 
preparedness and response activities are authorized in a timely 
manner.
    I am happy to get to work on other topics, as shown by a 
number of hearings and bills we have already moved through this 
subcommittee. However, trying to attach other issues into this 
reauthorization with broader topics will undermine its ultimate 
passage.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Guthrie follows:]

    Mr. Guthrie. I thank you, and I yield back.
    The Chair now recognizes the ranking member for 5 minutes 
for questions--for an opening statement, sorry.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ANNA G. ESHOO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
             CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Ms. Eshoo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning, 
colleagues and our witnesses that are here today. Thank you for 
being with us.
    During my floor speech on the passage of the original 
Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act in 2006, I said, 
``This bill demonstrates the good that can come out of 
bipartisan teamwork.'' Today, as the only original author of 
PAHPA still serving in Congress, I ask that Members recommit to 
bipartisan teamwork so that we can pass a reauthorization bill 
to ensure our country is doing its best to prepare for the 
worst.
    The 2023 PAHPA reauthorization must meet the challenges we 
witnessed during the COVID pandemic, and anticipate the 
challenges of the future. There is clear demand from 
stakeholders for improvements to the legislation. Over 250 
organizations replied to the request for information on PAHPA 
that Representative Hudson and I published.
    One critical area where our country is unprepared is our 
medical supply chain. During the pandemic, we saw that our 
medical supply chain is broken in three devastating ways: 
shortages of lifesaving supplies, especially when met with high 
demand during an emergency; subpar manufacturing; and an 
overreliance on foreign production.
    It is in the DNA of PAHPA to address gaps in supply. 
Project BioShield, the Biomedical Advanced Research and 
Development Authority, and the Strategic National Stockpile are 
authorized in PAHPA with the express purpose of ensuring access 
to medical countermeasures in times of emergency.
    This year's PAHPA reauthorization is another opportunity to 
fix the vulnerabilities of our drug and device supply chains. 
For example, as Dr. Califf of the FDA testified to during our 
topical hearing last month, the Federal Government does not 
have the information it needs to identify the sources of active 
pharmaceutical ingredients--we all shorthand it API--leaving 
who supplies many critical drug elements a mystery. My 
legislation, the Drug Origin Transparency Act, fills these gaps 
in knowledge so we can move more secure in our ability to 
respond to a health threat.
    To help prevent shortages, the FDA also needs notifications 
of supply interruptions for medical devices or unanticipated 
spikes in demand for drugs. If a drug goes into shortage, the 
FDA should be able to use data from the drug manufacturers to 
safely extend the shelf-life date.
    Finally, the FDA should be able to recall drugs that are 
either maliciously or accidentally contaminated in the same way 
it can recall biologics, devices, and food.
    I also support policy that would create a buffer stock for 
critical oncology drugs that are often in shortage due to 
quality problems for sterile injectable drugs, and I look 
forward to hearing from the oncologists on today's panel about 
this issue. Currently, we don't have a bipartisan agreement to 
include these policies in the bill, and I think it is critical.
    Let me just say this again: I think it is critical that we 
commit to move these policies forward in PAHPA. Chair Rodgers, 
Chair Guthrie, Representative Hudson, I hope you will work with 
me. I am asking you, I am really begging you to work with me to 
find a bipartisan path forward. That is how serious these 
issues are.
    I am pleased that today we will consider important 
legislation to improve CDC's public health data, create a 
diagnostic preparedness plan, and provide BARDA with many of 
the important contract authorities that Assistant Secretary 
O'Connell described during our last hearing.
    I am hopeful we can include these commonsense policies as 
well as address concerns about the medical supply chains in the 
final reauthorization. Our Nation's health and our Nation's 
security depend on it.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS, A 
    REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Mrs. Rodgers. Today we are considering several pieces of 
legislation critical to our national public security--public 
health security. This conversation could not come at a more 
pressing or relevant time. America is facing public health 
security threats on many fronts.
    For example, a recent State Department report confirmed 
North Korea continues to develop genetically engineered 
biological weapons, including bacteria, viruses, and toxins. 
According to one report, nearly 60 million patient records were 
compromised last year through over 900 data breach incidences.
    And we continue to learn lessons from the unprecedented 
COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. We must be prepared for and ready 
to respond to these threats--chemical, biological, 
radiological, nuclear, or cyber attacks--by taking an all-
hazards and threat-agnostic approach. That is the focus of the 
solutions we are considering today that Mr. Guthrie discussed 
in detail.
    I understand that some of my Democratic colleagues are 
upset that we are not considering legislation related to drug 
shortages and larger supply chain issues. I will say to them I 
welcome that discussion. Just last week, the FDA announced that 
more than 130 drugs were in short supply, 14 of which are 
cancer treatments. Clearly, this must be addressed.
    A few weeks ago, the Oversight Subcommittee held a hearing 
on this exact topic. And just yesterday, Senate Finance Ranking 
Member Crapo and I released a public request for information to 
solicit information and ideas on the underlying economic causes 
of drug shortages, the potential role of Federal programs in 
contributing to drug shortage, and possible solutions.
    Finding solutions for drug shortages are broader than this 
reauthorization and FDA, and outside the scope of this 
preparedness reauthorization. I welcome my colleagues, 
Democratic colleagues and Republican, to work together on this 
effort. And I remind them that the focus of today's legislative 
hearing is on ensuring we reauthorize immediate preparedness 
and response programs.
    For many of these threats, from catastrophic natural 
disaster to a biological threat to cyber attack, the question 
is not if, but when. And I thank many Members for their hard 
work on the reforms we are considering today.
    I especially want to express appreciation to Congressman 
Richard Hudson for his leadership to provide the framework for 
these discussions, and commend him and his team for their hard 
work.
    [The prepared statement of Mrs. Rodgers follows:]
    
    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mrs. Rodgers. I am going to yield now to Congressman Hudson 
to further speak to these efforts and what happens if we fail 
to come together to pass this reauthorization on time.
    Mr. Hudson. Well, I thank the chairwoman. You know, after 
years of preparing for this reauthorization, I have been proud 
to work with my Republican and Democrat colleagues to ensure 
that our Nation is best prepared and able to respond to any 
future public health security threat.
    At the beginning of this year, I put out a request for 
information along with my colleague, Ranking Member Anna Eshoo, 
to solicit important stakeholder feedback on this 
reauthorization. I am honored to work with the Ranking Member 
Eshoo, a four-time champion of PAHPA, someone who knows the 
critical importance of getting this bill across the finish 
line.
    With that being said, I worry that my colleagues are losing 
sight of the need to pass this bill this year. From the 
beginning, I have worked in good faith with the Democrats on 
negotiating a bill that can pass the House, particularly 
considering the current dynamics of this Congress. I have been 
clear since the start of my priorities and the confines we are 
working under. It is disappointing to me that the Democrats 
have recently decided to walk away from this conversation and 
force a 1-year extension of PAHPA.
    We are running out the clock debating issues that, while 
absolutely needing to be addressed, have never been included 
before in this reauthorization. And I have made the unequivocal 
commitment to Ranking Member Eshoo to work on these issues.
    We admittedly saw countless mistakes in the response to 
COVID. However, it is important to remember that, without these 
key authorities and programs and the foresight of the previous 
champions of this bill--Representatives Eshoo, Burr, Rodgers, 
Brooks, and others--it terrifies me to think of what could have 
happened: no Operation Warp Speed, no public-private 
partnerships to rush test and therapeutics and PPE procurement 
and acquisition. This reauthorization is absolutely critical to 
prepare for the next disaster, as the chairwoman laid out very 
eloquently in her remarks.
    I want to see this bill continue to move forward in a 
bipartisan manner, and I would ask my Democrat colleagues to 
return to the table, and let's continue to negotiate in good 
faith.
    I also want to say I appreciate--I look forward to hearing 
from our witnesses, particularly Dr. Washington from 
Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and Mr. Okon, who happens 
to be my constituent. Thank you all for being here today.
    And with that, I yield back.
    Mr. Guthrie. The gentlelady yields back?
    Mrs. Rodgers. I yield back.
    Mr. Guthrie. The Chair now recognizes the ranking member of 
the full committee, Mr. Pallone, for 5 minutes for an opening 
statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, Jr., A REPRESENTATIVE 
            IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    When COVID-19 hit, the Federal Government was not 
adequately prepared, and we have not done enough to prepare for 
the next threat. Unfortunately, the legislation the Republican 
majority has noticed for today continues to leave us vulnerable 
to future threats. It fails to make any significant new 
investments in our pandemic preparedness. It further 
politicizes public health by overriding the scientific decision 
making of our public health agencies. And Republicans have 
refused to include any legislation at this hearing to 
strengthen the resilience of the supply chain.
    Now, throughout the public health emergency, healthcare 
providers, States, and emergency responders faced supply 
shortages of ventilators, PPE, critical medication, and testing 
supplies. And now we are seeing shortages of chemotherapy drugs 
that are threatening the path to recovery for so many patients 
battling cancer. Weeks ago, Democrats introduced five bills 
that would help us strengthen the supply chain, and none of 
these bills were included in today's hearing.
    Ranking Member Eshoo introduced a bill that would bring 
transparency to drug manufacturing. The United States is 
overreliant on foreign suppliers for critical drugs, and 
unfortunately we don't even know how bad the problem is or 
what--or which drugs rely on foreign suppliers. And Ranking 
Member Eshoo's legislation would help the FDA understand the 
entirety of the drug supply chain, which would be beneficial if 
there is manufacturing--or a manufacturing or quality issue 
that could lead to a shortage. FDA would then know what 
suppliers drug manufacturers are relying on, so that it could 
quickly address the problem.
    When drug shortages happen, FDA can work with sponsors to 
extend the shelf life of the drugs available in the market to 
the latest possible date without losing drug quality, 
effectiveness, or safety. However, obtaining scientific 
information from drug sponsors to support an expiration date 
change can sometimes take weeks or months. That is time 
patients may not have. The Ensuring Access to Lifesaving Drugs 
Act, introduced by Representative Slotkin, would streamline 
this process.
    Additionally, we know that there are times when FDA is not 
even aware that a shortage of a product is coming. When there 
are unforeseen demand spikes, FDA has little insight into these 
issues until the problem is already impacting patients. 
Bipartisan legislation from Representative Jacobs and Mills 
would ensure manufacturers notify FDA when these demand spikes 
occur. Right now, there is also no requirement in place for 
medical device manufacturers to notify FDA of supply problems. 
Representative Castor has introduced a bill to fix that.
    We also requested that the Republican majority finally take 
on the glaring drug safety risk that exists when a dangerous or 
contaminated drug must be recalled but FDA has no power to 
put--to take it from the shelves. And this committee has worked 
to fix this problem before on a bipartisan basis, and it is 
time we finally get this done.
    I honestly think that the Republican majority's refusal to 
include these bills at today's legislative hearing is 
irresponsible. You know, I have heard the arguments. Mr. Hudson 
said--sort of suggested that the disarray on the floor makes 
this impossible for us to move ahead with a lot of things, or 
to do much at one time.
    I don't want to put words in your mouth, but that is how I 
interpreted what you say. And, you know, I am sorry, but the 
Republican disarray on the floor should not be the basis for us 
not to act because, I don't know, at any given day--I mean, we 
had 4 days pass without voting on anything. So what does that 
mean, I am just supposed to not introduce bills or try to act 
on anything because, you know, some people on the right are 
going to take down the Speaker?
    I mean, we can't act on that. I mean, we can't proceed 
based on that. And PAHPA is a must-pass bill. So if we don't 
include legislation addressing drug shortages now, it is just 
not going to happen. There is not going to be enough time. So 
that is why we continue to insist that these bills dealing with 
the shortages be included.
    Now, while the majority was not willing to include drug and 
device policies, a few bills noticed for today's hearing would 
make strides toward improving our public health response.
    A bill introduced by Representative Underwood would 
strengthen real-time, standardized data availability of 
emerging public health threats at the CDC. As Dr. Walensky and 
others have testified, during the COVID-19 and Mpox public 
health emergencies CDC was often left with incomplete, 
inconsistent, and out-of-date data that hindered our response. 
And this legislation would clarify their authorities, helping 
us to prepare for emerging threats going forward.
    We are also considering my bill to remove the requirement 
that the Senate confirm the CDC Director, a misguided change 
that the Senate insisted on, including in our omnibus package 
at the end of last year. When President Biden took office, it 
was important that he was able to immediately appoint a CDC 
Director to lead the agency during the COVID pandemic. And it 
is critical to have an expert CDC Director in place right away 
to respond to the public health threats with speed, focus, and 
foresight and without furthering the politicization of public 
health that has become too commonplace. And we all know that 
the Senate doesn't do anything quickly.
    So, again, I have serious concerns about policies that 
would allow congressional interference in the termination of a 
public health emergency, new and unworkable requirements for 
CDC guidance, and industry decision making of the PHEMCE. While 
it concerns me that the Republican majority doesn't seem to 
appreciate the full scope of the challenges we face, I hope we 
can find a way to move forward in a comprehensive, bipartisan 
way, because it is important that we come together to learn the 
lessons of COVID-19 and reauthorize PAHPA on time.

    Mr. Pallone. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. The gentleman yields back. That 
concludes our opening statements, and we will now turn to the 
panel for 5 minutes for their opening statements.
    I will introduce you all, then call on you one at a time.
    You will notice the clock system. You have 5 minutes. It 
will be green. I think with a minute to go it turns yellow, and 
then that will kind of give you a hint that your time is 
approaching. And then, if it turns red, begin to wrap up. I 
appreciate your being here. And I will introduce all the 
witnesses first.
    We are going to have--before us today will be Dr. Gerald 
Parker, the associate dean for Global One Health and director 
of the Pandemic and Biosecurity Policy Program at Texas A&M 
University.
    Next is Dr. Raynard Washington, director of the Public 
Health Department in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, as has 
already been noted by our favorite Tar Heel here today. And I 
mean that as a citizen of the State, not as a graduate.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Guthrie. I know his college.
    Our next witness is Ms. Phyllis Arthur, senior vice 
president of infectious disease and emerging science policy at 
Biotechnology Innovation Organization.
    Our witnesses will follow with Dr. Julie Gralow, chief 
medical officer and executive vice president of the American 
Society of Clinical Oncology.
    And then our final witness this morning will be Ted Okon, 
executive director of Community Oncology Alliance.
    I will begin--we will begin to recognize our first witness, 
Dr. Parker.
    You are recognized for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

         STATEMENT OF GERALD W. PARKER, Jr., DVM, Ph.D.

    Dr. Parker. Well, thank you, Chairman Guthrie and Ranking 
Members--Ranking Member Eshoo, for the opportunity to come 
before you today. I am Dr. Gerald Parker.
    Today--but today--I am from Texas A&M University, but today 
the views and opinions I offer are my own but are informed by 
serving in career executive leadership positions in the 
military and the Federal Government. I appreciate the 
opportunity to come here today, because you are working on one 
of the most important bills in Congress this year: the 
reauthorization to PAHPA.
    We live in a dangerous world. The threats we face range 
from terrorism, chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, 
cyber, natural disasters, climate change, pandemics, and more 
that we do not even yet grasp their understanding. These are 
hard problems, and we must have the right tools to confront an 
ever-expanding list of potentially catastrophic threats, 
whether natural, accidental, or deliberate. And in this new, 
dangerous era of global power rivalry, we were--conflict, 
economic conflict, war, and even the threat of an adversarial 
nation state's use of weapons of mass destruction cannot be 
discounted.
    You have the opportunity to meet this moment. Don't waste 
it. The risk we face certainly won't wait for us to be 
prepared.
    Now, with that dire warning, I have four central 
recommendations for your consideration.
    First, ASPR's relationships with State, local, Tribal, and 
territorial emergency response, hospital, healthcare, and 
public health departments must be strengthened. Any successful 
response requires a close working relationship between the 
Federal Government and State and local partners who are on the 
front line.
    Second, it will be critical for PAHPA to address the supply 
chain control tower capacity and concept by encouraging a warm-
base and a surgical situational awareness supply chain and 
early warning capability that can be immediately activated when 
the next health security crisis starts. ASPR must be able to 
anticipate the needs of State and local partners, hospitals, 
and the healthcare system and fulfill their requirements, 
especially when resources are scarce.
    Third, the importance of leadership cannot be overstated. 
And when I say leadership, I mean an organizational structure 
authorized by Congress that empowers an individual with the ear 
of the President and the OMB Director. Without an effective 
leadership structure that bridges the seams in the Federal 
bureaucracy, even the best of leaders will not be effective.
    I commend Congress for taking a major step toward these 
goals through authorization to the White House Office of 
Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy. This is a good 
starting point but should be expanded to include biodefense and 
global health security.
    And to share a recommendation from a colleague of mine, Dr. 
Ken Bernard, this office should be led by a full-time 
equivalent of a combatant commander, a Deputy Assistant to the 
President for BSiosecurity at the White House to lead and 
prepare to battle our next national security health crisis.
    Fourth, in regard to ASPR, I would like to direct the 
committee's attention to the 12 findings and recommendations in 
the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity's 2023 
report regarding dual-use research concern and enhanced 
potential pandemic research. We need to take a more active 
approach to harmonize biosafety and biosecurity standards 
worldwide and keeping sound practices at home. Other countries 
look to us, and Congress and the administration have an 
opportunity to lead.
    In conclusion, we can not only prepare for risks like SARS-
CoV-2, we must prepare for advanced dual-use technologies and 
emerging infectious diseases with properties that could make 
existing preparedness efforts useless if they are based on only 
our latest response to the latest pandemic.
    As the Office of the Director of National Intelligence 2023 
Annual Threat Assessment plainly states, ``Rapid advances in 
dual-use technology, including bioinformatics, synthetic 
biology, nanotechnology, and genomic editing could enable the 
development of novel biological weapons that complicate 
detection, attribution, and treatment.'' And I will add the 
likelihood of misuse or accidents are increasing, as 
laboratories expand worldwide with ready access to dual-use 
technologies and without adequate international standards.
    We have entered an extremely dangerous era. There is one 
thing we can be assured of in the future: We will be surprised. 
We must avoid fighting the last war, and we must avoid 
complacency.
    Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the 
committee. I would be glad to answer any of your questions. 
Thank you.

    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you, Dr. Parker. I appreciate your 
testimony.
    Dr. Washington, you are now recognized for 5 minutes for an 
opening statement.

             STATEMENT OF RAYNARD WASHINGTON, Ph.D.

    Dr. Washington. Perfect. Good morning. Thank you, Chairman 
Guthrie, Ranking Member Eshoo, and members of the Health 
Subcommittee. Thank you for having me today to discuss the 
reauthorization of PAHPA. I am Dr. Raynard Washington, the 
public health director in Mecklenburg County, which serves the 
City of Charlotte and the surrounding county in the great State 
of North Carolina.
    I also have the pleasure of serving as vice chair of the 
Big Cities Health Coalition, an organization of health 
officials who lead 35 of the Nation's largest metropolitan 
health departments. Together we serve more than 61 million 
Americans and nearly 20 percent of the country.
    I am an epidemiologist by training and bring with me more 
than 15 years of experience in public health at both the 
Federal and local levels. Prior to Charlotte, I served as the 
health--deputy health commissioner and chief epidemiologist for 
the City of Philadelphia.
    My health department is responsible for protecting and 
promoting health for more than 1.1 million North Carolinians in 
our diverse and rapidly growing community, and our health 
department team has grown to close to 900 over the last few 
years.
    Local public health departments are on the front lines of 
preparing for, responding to, and supporting residents during 
emergencies. There are very few, if any, emergencies that don't 
have some impact on the public's health. And maintaining 
coordinated networks and preparing partners on the ground for 
emergencies before they happen is the only way we can respond 
quickly. This is a very unique role of local public health.
    Just last week there was an acute public health response to 
the Canadian fire smoke traveling across this region. Public 
health departments at the State and local level were able to 
respond because of the work they had put into maintaining a 
true all-hazards response, which is critical to our Nation's 
health.
    As we see the resurgence of infectious diseases like 
measles and polio in pockets across the country, it is clear 
that all-hazards preparedness must be at the forefront of our 
Nation's public health system. And as we move out of the COVID-
19 pandemic, it is a timely opportunity to take steps to 
improve the system using what we have learned over the last few 
years. To that end, I firmly believe that the reauthorization 
of PAHPA is a critical component for preparing for the next 
emergency in this country.
    It is essential that Federal agencies have clear 
preparedness and response roles well in advance of an 
emergency. At the same time, while Federal leadership and 
resources are vital, a top-down approach to public health is 
simply not sufficient. To truly function as a system, public 
health leaders must be involved at every level of government--
local, State, and Federal--and information, data, and resources 
must flow quickly and efficiently to and from each of those 
levels. Unless and until that happens, we will remain 
underprepared for the health and health security challenges we 
face.
    A few highlights on various PAHPA components.
    First, the public health preparedness program that was 
created after 9/11 to support preparedness infrastructure is 
critical to having a response-ready workforce at the local 
level. However, despite the increase in emerging and reemerging 
infectious diseases, it has been cut by nearly 30 percent over 
the last 20 years.
    In Mecklenburg, we have had to increase our public health 
preparedness staff from one FTE to three since the start of the 
pandemic to meet our needs. These vital human resources, which 
may sound small, allow us to train clinical and nonclinical 
staff and maintain and implement when necessary local response 
plans for every type of hazard.
    Likewise, the Hospital Preparedness Program, which has also 
been cut by more than half over the last 20 years, prepares the 
Nation's healthcare system to save lives during emergencies and 
disasters. HPP supports regional healthcare coalitions like the 
Metrolina Healthcare Preparedness Coalition in our region in 
North Carolina. They are responsible for assessing risk and 
needs, providing training, and maintaining preparedness among 
organizations who might otherwise see themselves as 
competitors. Or, for example, like during the pandemic, 
deploying mobile hospitals due to the crushing demand on acute-
care facilities.
    Additionally, now is the time to authorize an adult vaccine 
program akin to the Vaccines for Children program. As we 
learned from the pandemic, a comprehensive vaccine 
infrastructure is needed to protect Americans against both 
known and emerging infectious disease. During the Mpox 
response, we received no Federal support at the local level for 
vaccine administration, but our department successfully, like 
others, mobilized partnerships with LGBT+ community and social 
organizations to contain the situation.
    On the other hand, our progress during COVID was only 
possible because vaccine cost was not a barrier for our 
residents.
    Finally, and most importantly, as an epidemiologist it is 
critical that we have timely, accurate, and actionable data at 
the local, State, and Federal level. Our systems for early 
detection and surveillance need upgrading and modernizing. CDC 
must have--collaborate with other HHS divisions and partners 
across all levels of government to strengthen our public health 
data systems with better technologies and leveraging both the 
private-sector knowledge and expertise.
    From the perspective of local health departments, CDC 
absolutely must have the authority to effectively collect and 
coordinate public health data necessary to serve its mission. 
We are collectively tasked to make million-, billion-, and even 
trillion-dollar decisions with the current framework for 
collecting and sharing public health data that results in 
fragmented and inconsistent reporting to CDC and to the State 
and local agencies. Expanded data authority for CDC will allow 
for more complete and timely data sharing to support decision 
making at the Federal, State, and local levels.
    In closing, I want to emphasize that a well-functioning 
public health system is a--is pandemic preparedness and must be 
well-resourced at all levels of government before, during, and 
after emergencies. Diseases and disasters don't recognize city, 
county, or State boundaries, and across the Nation each 
community is only as prepared as its weakest neighboring 
community.
    Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Washington follows:]
    
    
    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you, Dr. Washington. Thank you for your 
testimony.
    Ms. Arthur, you are now recognized for 5 minutes for an 
opening statement.

                  STATEMENT OF PHYLLIS ARTHUR

    Ms. Arthur. Thank you. Chairman Guthrie, Ranking Member 
Eshoo, and members of the subcommittee, thank you so much for 
inviting me to testify today. My name again is Phyllis Arthur. 
I am the senior vice president for infectious diseases and 
emerging science policy at BIO, the Biotechnology Innovation 
Organization.
    This is an important moment for our Nation as we emerge 
from a multiyear global pandemic. We have an opportunity to use 
what we have learned to ensure we are better prepared in the 
future. While we hope that the COVID pandemic is a once-in-a-
generation occurrence, that is not certain. Over the past 
decade, we have faced near-miss pandemics, from SARS to Zika to 
avian flu.
    While our response to the pandemic was incredible in scale 
and successful in its aims to rapidly and safely develop 
vaccines and therapeutics for a novel pathogen, there is no 
guarantee that we could replicate that success again without 
making permanent the pieces of the response that led to that 
success. In fact, during the pandemic we had to respond to 
monkeypox, Ebola, and Marburg outbreaks and provide support to 
our allies for chem, bio, rad, and nuke threats.
    Now is not the time to rest. Now is the time to improve our 
systems and commit to public-private partnerships that will 
continuously usher in innovation that can help keep us safe. It 
is not only critical that we reauthorize PAHPA but that we 
strengthen the law as well.
    Following the terror attacks of September 11th, our 
Government acted swiftly and comprehensively to protect our 
citizens. Similarly, following the 2001 anthrax attacks, 
Congress acted to create Project BioShield and later BARDA, 
which are foundational to our protection from biological 
threats. These laws built the important structural and 
financial changes needed to develop medical countermeasures for 
an expanding set of natural, accidental, and deliberate 
threats.
    However, BARDA and the Strategic National Stockpile remain 
underfunded, and our surveillance tools are underdeveloped. To 
better respond to the next inevitable threat, we must use the 
PAHPA reauthorization action to make substantive improvements 
in the PHEMCE.
    First, BIO strongly recommends that Congress increase 
funding for key ASPR programs to the levels of the PHEMCE 
multiyear budget. The BARDA Advanced Research and Development, 
the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund, and the Strategic 
National Stockpile should all be authorized at over $1.5 
billion each to ensure that there are ample funds for the 
development, procurement, lifecycle management, and 
manufacturing support for a broad array of medical 
countermeasures.
    Separate funding of at least $330 million is needed to 
support continued development and sustainment of pandemic 
influenza vaccines, antivirals, and diagnostics, as pandemic 
flu remains one of our most persistent global threats.
    Lastly, BIO recommends that funding be allocated to BARDA 
to enable a pathogen-agnostic viral family approach to R&D and 
manufacturing. This approach will help us better prepare for a 
broad set of emerging pathogens of pandemic potential by 
leveraging novel platform technologies and novel mechanisms for 
new vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and oral antivirals.
    Second, BIO recommends several policies that will help 
incentivize industry and strengthen the partnership between the 
Government and developers. We recommend increasing the 
transparency of the SNS by encouraging the sharing of MCM 
requirements. This should be done with private-sector partners 
on a regular basis.
    We also strongly recommend that Congress eliminate the 
sunset of the MCM Priority Review Voucher Program, as this 
program is an important incentive for the development of novel 
MCMs.
    And lastly, we strongly encourage the inclusion of the 
PASTEUR Act to spur the development of much-needed novel 
antimicrobials.
    Third, BIO recommends that ASPR be granted new authorities 
that expand their use of the other transactions authority, that 
they have authorities to enable domestic manufacturing 
investment, and allow for rapid procurement and acquisition.
    Fourth, given the vital role of a strong public health 
infrastructure to our national response, BIO recommends 
increased funding for surveillance capabilities at the CDC to 
better detect, monitor, and respond to outbreaks and emerging 
pathogens around the world.
    We also support funding CDC's ability to partner with 
States to expand and strengthen State immunization 
infrastructure, especially for adult immunization.
    In reauthorizing PAHPA, Congress must continue to send a 
strong signal that it is committed to prioritizing national 
health security by providing the resources and authorities 
needed to fully prepare for and defend against biological 
threats. Investments in preparedness and medical countermeasure 
development will enhance our response efforts, save lives, and 
be more cost effective to our economy in an emergency.
    Thank you.

    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you, I appreciate it, Ms. Arthur, your 
testimony.
    The Chair now recognizes Dr. Gralow for 5 minutes for your 
opening statement.

               STATEMENT OF JULIE R. GRALOW, M.D.

    Dr. Gralow. Chairman Guthrie, Ranking Member Eshoo, and 
members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to 
discuss the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act and its 
potential to help address the cancer drug shortages crisis.
    I am Dr. Julie Gralow, chief medical officer and executive 
vice president of the Association for Clinical Oncology. Prior 
to joining ASCO, I was a practicing medical oncologist and 
professor in Washington State for three decades.
    ASCO represents over 45,000 oncology professionals who are 
dedicated to improving cancer care. We appreciate the 
subcommittee's efforts to improve the programs in PAHPA to 
better prepare the U.S. for future public health crises.
    The pandemic exacerbated longstanding issues that threaten 
the resilience of our healthcare supply chain. While the 
Strategic National Stockpile and other programs authorized 
under PAHPA aided the healthcare community during the public 
health emergency, more must be done. Drug shortages will worsen 
without intervention. This is especially true for sterile 
injectables, many of which are oncology drugs.
    These drugs are expensive to make, they have a low profit 
margin, and they lead manufacturers to reduce or discontinue 
production. Active pharmaceutical ingredient sourcing is a weak 
point. Many manufacturers use the same API source. If that 
source experiences quality issues causing a production shutdown 
or runs out of critical components, drug shortages are a likely 
outcome.
    Visibility into the supply chain regarding APIs is lacking. 
The FDA does not have authority to require manufacturers to 
provide API sourcing information. This means shortages can 
emerge without warning. Today's shortages are the worst that I 
have seen in my 30-year career.
    I am in regular communication with colleagues at the 
University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research 
Center in Seattle. Initially, they were optimistic that, with 
dose modifications and substitutions, they had enough supply of 
these platinum agents to ride the shortage out. Then, however, 
many of the State's smaller cancer centers began running out of 
the drug and sending their patients to the UW, depleting their 
supply.
    I spoke to a patient diagnosed with endometrial cancer, 
whose team recommended a chemotherapy course that included a 
platinum agent. She studied the drugs and their side effects. 
She had a game plan, and she did well through her first cycle 
of treatment, much to her relief. Then, when arriving for her 
second dose, one of the agents was no longer available. You can 
imagine the anxiety this caused. Even when there are acceptable 
and proven alternatives, switching a planned course of 
treatment adds fear and stress to that already caused by a 
cancer diagnosis.
    Eleven oncology drugs, maybe 14, are currently in shortage. 
Four of these--cisplatin, carboplatin, methotrexate, and 
fludarabine--are commonly used to treat cancer in adults and 
children. In 2022, 100,000 Americans were diagnosed with 
ovarian, bladder, and testicular cancers, cancers for which 
cisplatin and carboplatin are recommended. These drugs are also 
commonly used in cervical, endometrial, lung, head and neck, 
esophageal, gastric, and breast cancers. The number of U.S. 
patients at risk could be as high as 500,000 a year.
    Drug shortage risks also extend to pediatric patients. From 
2010 to 2020, 8 of the 10 most frequently used drugs to treat 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common childhood cancer, 
were at some point unavailable.
    Beyond drugs, we have experienced essential supply 
shortages, including glass vials, IV tubing, saline bags, and 
more. Shortages place providers in a moral dilemma, 
prioritizing drug use for patients who are curable versus those 
who are not. Patients worry about whether they will receive 
their next treatment or if switching to another treatment will 
shorten their lives.
    The PAHPA reauthorization is an opportunity to advance 
solutions to improve the supply chain, especially during public 
health crises. ASCO makes the following recommendations 
detailed in my written statement: improve the function and 
composition of the National Strategic Stockpile; enhance 
multinational collaboration on supply chain resilience; 
incentivize manufacturers to improve quality and transparency; 
reduce reliance on other countries for critical ingredients; 
analyze domestic drug and device manufacturing capability and 
capacity for critical products to avert national security 
threats.
    I appreciate the subcommittee's efforts to enhance the 
supply chain to protect our national security and our patients' 
health. ASCO stands ready to collaborate with you to ensure 
individuals with cancer receive the lifesaving and life-
prolonging treatments they require. This is a crisis. Cancer 
patients' lives are on the line.
    Thank you.

    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you, Dr. Gralow. I appreciate your 
testimony.
    We now--the Chair now recognizes Mr. Okon for 5 minutes for 
an opening statement.

                     STATEMENT OF TED OKON

    Mr. Okon. Chairman Guthrie, Ranking Member Eshoo, and 
members of the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, I am 
the executive director of the Community Oncology Alliance, a 
nonprofit organization dedicated to cancer patients and their 
independent oncology providers.
    My wife, Susan, practiced as an oncology nurse for 10 
years, and we have family and friends with cancer, living with 
it and dying from the disease. I want to make it very clear 
that my overriding goal is to ensure that every American with 
cancer--regardless of demographic, financial, or any other 
status--has access to the highest quality, most affordable 
cancer care close to home.
    Let me get right to the point. There is a growing crisis of 
a severe shortage of low-cost generic drugs used to treat 
cancer, including carboplatinum, cisplatin, and 5-FU. Although 
decades old, these are mainstay treatments for many types of 
cancers, including curable cancers. As a result of these drug 
shortages, Americans with cancer are facing treatment delays, 
potentially receiving inferior treatments, and even having 
their treatments stopped. What is heartbreaking is that 
Americans with potentially curable cancers may miss treatments 
and even a cure because of these shortages.
    Our inaction in fundamentally solving the cancer drug 
shortage problem, which has existed for years but is now the 
most severe we have ever faced, has already likely signed a 
death sentence for some Americans. Frustration and outright 
anger do not begin to describe how I feel in reading heartbreak 
stories of patients with cancer not being able to receive 
treatment due to shortages of decades-old, low-cost generic 
drugs.
    I testified to Congress 12 years ago--nearly 12 years ago--
of the then-cancer-drug shortage. I said then, and I repeat 
today, ``The fundamental root cause of cancer drug shortages is 
financial.''
    Unfortunately, recent solutions deal with symptoms of the 
problem, but none address the underlying financial cause of 
shortages. Imagine being very diligent about staying out of the 
sun and getting regular skin checkups. If you had a suspicious-
looking mole, had it biopsied, and found that you had melanoma, 
you would not be in denial and simply put a Band-Aid on it. You 
would have the underlying cancer treated.
    The problem is that many of the solutions being advanced--
is that they involve tracking early warning signs of shortages 
and placing even more regulations on generic drug 
manufacturers, which can actually have unintended consequences 
of exacerbating the problem. At best, these are mere Band-Aids.
    Denial of the financial cause of these shortages is once 
again costing Americans hope and even lives. Understanding the 
underlying problem does not require a Ph.D. in economics. If a 
generic drug manufacturer cannot make a profit on a drug, it 
will simply stop making the drug. If a manufacturer makes a 
small margin on the drug, it will cut manufacturing costs, 
which makes it more prone to the types of problems that result 
in FDA inspections shutting down plants. Unfortunately, given 
that many of the drugs in short supply are money losers, we 
have seen more manufacturers leave the market. Today, not only 
is there no manufacturing redundancy at the manufacturing 
level, but there is little or no redundancy in the market as a 
whole.
    These cancer drugs are injectables administered 
intravenously or by similar means. These are not pills or 
tablets. The manufacturing involved in producing sterile 
injectable drugs is far more involved and exacting--as well as 
capital intensive--than making pills or tablets.
    As I explained in my written testimony, the fundamental 
financial problems for generic drug manufacturers are the 
Medicare Part B drug reimbursement system based on average 
sales price, which is also used by commercial payers, caps drug 
prices.
    Additionally, mandatory 340B drug pricing discounts and 
Medicaid rebates erode drug prices, and the Inflation Reduction 
Act price inflation caps further put downward pressure on 
injectable generic drug prices. These products are, at best, so 
unprofitable that there is little to no margin to invest in 
manufacturing upgrades. At worst, there is little manufacturing 
redundancy as manufacturers leave the market.
    We need to face the reality that price caps, discounts, 
rebates, and regulation need to be stripped from the market, or 
shortages will worsen. Congress needs to stop Band-Aiding the 
problem and fix the fundamental financial problem, as well as 
bring manufacturing back to the United States.
    The stories I am hearing from oncologists about these 
shortages are beyond heartbreaking. We owe it to the 32-year-
old mother with aggressive breast cancer and her 3 children to 
get her the treatment she needs now but is blocked from because 
of these shortages.
    It is tough enough dealing with cancer. Americans should 
not lose hope or, worse, their lives fighting this terrible 
disease. We all need to work together to fix the fundamental 
financial cause of drug shortages. Every American with cancer 
is counting on us.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify, and I welcome 
your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Okon follows:]
    
    
    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you, Mr. Okon, for your testimony.
    That completes witnesses' opening statements, and we will 
begin the questioning period for a 5-minute round of--5 minutes 
for questions. And I will recognize myself for 5 minutes.
    So, Ms. Arthur, would you talk about how important the 
impact of Operation Warp Speed was at the beginning of COVID?
    And what do you believe is the correct role for the private 
sector to play in our Nation's preparedness and response?
    And do you believe the proposed PHEMCE Advisory Committee 
Act will help us address gaps in our preparation for and 
response to--future responses?
    Ms. Arthur. Thank you, Chairman Guthrie, for that question.
    Operation Warp Speed was actually an excellent example of 
what we would like to see happen with the law in PAHPA. The 
work that was done between the Federal Government and industry 
partners was exceptional. Government actually drove the 
activities of industry in a collaborative way. We were 
partners, we weren't vendors.
    We actually worked very closely with the FDA, with the CDC, 
with Operation Warp Speed leadership in DoD and ASPR, and 
actually came up with the strategy for driving very increased 
scalability of manufacturing. Clinical trial guidance from the 
FDA actually helped us deliver safe vaccines that had diversity 
in the clinical trials that allowed us to tell people they were 
getting something safe in record time, and that led to vaccines 
being available in 300 days. This is incredible.
    So that kind of partnership, where the expertise and 
experience of industry for manufacturing, clinical trial 
development, knowing how to manufacture products well was 
really coupled well with the Government's leadership in 
facilitating that process. And this is the kind of partnership 
that we need in the interpandemic period, so that we are 
actually ready to go in less time than 1 year, with the next 
time we have to respond to a pandemic. Operation Warp Speed is 
a really good example of that.
    Mr. Guthrie. OK. Thank you, thank you for that. I want to 
move on to Dr. Parker.
    The Government Accountability Office reported that the CDC 
never established contracts with private-sector vendors to 
quickly roll out a testing regime, and that left us hamstrung.
    I have legislation before us today. How do you believe 
the--so the legislation before us today--clinical labs' ability 
to enter into certain contracts and cooperative agreements. So 
how do you believe this legislation will help us more 
effectively respond to future threats?
    Dr. Parker. Well, I think, actually, it is in line with 
what Phyllis just said about the public-private partnerships 
and involving private industry, the sooner the better. And so I 
think we need to do the same thing in our diagnostic world and 
our diagnostic enterprise.
    We cannot just rely on our Federal Government or State 
government public health laboratories to take care of the whole 
job, and so we need to have our private-sector engagement in 
these laboratory and diagnostics from the start.
    And it is most important--also, it is in the interepidemic 
period that we need to do this. We cannot wait until there is a 
crisis to do this. So I support the effort to try to get the 
private sector engaged during the interepidemic period in these 
efforts.
    Mr. Guthrie. OK, thanks. I have been concerned about--Dr. 
Parker, this for you, as well--I have been concerned about just 
the executive authority declaring emergencies and having kind 
of unlimited time moving forward. Some States--I know my home 
State went in and put a limit on what the Governor could do. We 
had emergencies, and so we can't just govern by fiat. And we 
had an emergency with record flooding in Appalachia, we called 
the General Assembly together. Instead of one person choosing 
to spend hundreds of millions of dollars, they came together as 
a group and said--and rose to the occasion.
    You know, some people want to dismiss Congress and just 
turn everything over to the experts. We know the experts got a 
lot wrong. They got a lot right and they got a lot wrong that 
is going to have a lasting impact. And I do believe that the 
legislative authority shouldn't just be dismissed and say, 
well, let's just turn it over because it is too difficult to 
bring everybody together. Well, that is what our Founding 
Fathers wanted to do.
    So one of my bills would allow Congress to vote to extend 
the public health emergency for 6 months after it has been 
declared. Would you talk about the role for Congress in this, 
and what you see in that bill?
    Dr. Parker. Yes. Well, certainly, maybe I am not a 
constitutional expert, but certainly there is a definite role 
for all three branches of government, including congressional 
oversight. It is absolutely essential. And I would say, 
actually, there is a role for investigative journalism, as 
well, to keep us all honest too, in the--and I am talking as a 
former government employee.
    But I think maybe one thing that perhaps may have been 
lacking that--I think back to the H5N1 influenza preparedness 
days between 2006 and 2009--there were kind of like clear 
triggers and metrics of the phases of the pandemic that--I 
think we kind of lost that, you know, before COVID-19. And I 
think maybe one way to exercise the congressional oversight is 
to make sure our pandemic plans and strategies have clear 
triggers and metrics of, one, when a crisis and a public health 
emergency should be declared, and then what are the clear 
metrics and triggers of when it ends, when the public health 
emergency declaration ends. So I think that would help a lot.
    You know, I probably should stay out of the political thing 
and that.
    Mr. Guthrie. OK, thanks.
    Dr. Parker. But I think--but certainly, there is a place 
for congressional oversight, and I think our plans ought to 
have clear triggers and metrics of when it starts and when it 
ends.
    Mr. Guthrie. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. And my 
time has expired, so I will yield back, and the Chair now 
recognizes the Ranking Member Eshoo for 5 minutes for 
questions.
    Ms. Eshoo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to each 
one of the witnesses.
    To Dr. Gralow: On drug origin transparency, information on 
the supply chain for prescription drug products in New 
Zealand--I am really fascinated by this--is publicly disclosed 
and transparent.
    New Zealand collects and makes public the name and location 
of the API and the finished drug manufacturers. The data on the 
New Zealand Medsafe Public Access website can be analyzed to 
quickly determine which ones have the highest dependance on a 
certain geographic location, such as Wuhan, China. Within hours 
of the news of a plant closure, New Zealand could know which 
drug products will be affected and can look for other producers 
of the same drug to supplement the country's drug supply.
    How would your ability to treat your patients be impacted 
if the United States adopted a similar transparency policy 
where the FDA, hospitals, doctors, public policy analysts could 
monitor the U.S. upstream pharmaceutical supply chain to 
identify potential trigger points that could lead to supply 
chain vulnerability and to predict drug products that may face 
shortages?
    Dr. Gralow. Thank you for that question. I think that level 
of transparency to all, the ability to know where manufacturers 
are getting their raw materials from for everyone to know, 
would give us much more lead time when a problem exists. We 
would have much more time to be able to ramp up again, to look 
for alternative sources, to start to look toward importation--
the expanded shelf life, for example. It just would give us a 
much bigger time period to adjust and, hopefully, avert a 
crisis in that setting.
    Ms. Eshoo. Right.
    Dr. Gralow. We don't have that kind of information 
available at the raw materials level, the API level.
    Ms. Eshoo. Right. About achieving a stable supply of 
oncology drugs, in your testimony you propose the Government 
contract with manufacturers to create a buffer stock to achieve 
a short-term supply of oncology drugs. Can you speak to how 
that buffer stock would help address the acute shortages we are 
seeing now in oncology drugs?
    Dr. Gralow. Having, for example, a 6-month supply--whatever 
we would agree to--on board, whether it is at the manufacturer 
level or the Government or the buyer level, that constantly 
rotates--it would have to keep rotating because these agents 
have short half-lives--having 6 months would, again, give us 
much more time to ramp up and deal with the shortage.
    So on the one hand, having greater visibility when the 
problem first occurs, and then on the other hand having at 
least 6 months to gear up again would be a great help and 
likely avert many of these crises.
    Ms. Eshoo. Well, I appreciate each one of--the testimony of 
each one of the witnesses.
    I have never extracted my authorship or support before. 
This is major, major legislation. But colleagues, this is 
affecting--this drug shortage supply is affecting every single 
one of our congressional districts. This is not a Democratic 
idea. This is a national need, and it is a national crisis. 
This is, as Mr. Hudson said--and I have loved working with 
him--this is a must-pass bill, PAHPA is.
    I think addressing these shortages--I mean, it is just jaw-
dropping to me when you say a shortage of pediatric oncology 
drugs. We can do this. I just--it is--it really is a must.
    So thank you again to the witnesses.
    I will work with anyone on this committee to get this over 
the finish line. I am not suggesting that we have a section 
relative to the FDA in this legislation that is larger than the 
rest of the PAHPA legislation. But this is a crisis that needs 
to be addressed, and we need to answer to all of our 
constituents on it.
    And with that, I yield back the balance of my time.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. The gentlelady yields back. The 
Chair now recognizes Chair Rodgers for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [Audio malfunction] 
and we will continue to work with you on that. I think it is a 
question of what is in this bill before us today, and how we go 
about doing it. So we will keep those conversations going.
    Dr. Parker, during your time as Principal Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Preparedness and Response, can you explain your 
interaction with the National Council Advisory Committee on 
Individuals with Disabilities and Disasters, or any of the 
other national advisory committees?
    Dr. Parker. Sure, and I--actually, I think my experience 
when I was the ASPR--and before ASPR was formed, in the Office 
of Public Health Emergency Preparedness, was actually during 
Hurricane Katrina, Rita, Wilma, and that may have preceded the 
actual establishment of the NAC Advisory Committee.
    But the experience of Hurricane Katrina certainly formed 
our need of how we better take care of special needs, special 
medical needs population, and it was just really a horrible 
situation in New Orleans when prestorm, poststorm, local 
authorities really didn't know where some of these special 
needs people lived, and how do we evacuate those that need to 
be taken and taken care of that just need special help. And so 
I think that really helped to form why we need outside advisory 
bodies that have the expertise to--that maybe those in 
government do not, and to help us, you know, think about 
whether--new policies and programs that we need to do that.
    So in general, from my perspective, having outside Federal 
advisory boards was always very beneficial to me when I was in 
government. And since I have been out of government, I have 
served on several advisory boards, and I know the people who 
were asked to serve on advisory boards very much like the 
opportunity to be able to share their expertise with the 
Federal Government.
    One cautionary note I would say, though, as you consider 
any kind of further legislation, it is important how the 
executive branch uses advisory boards. And I have seen examples 
of some advisory boards being taken very seriously and run very 
well, where there's clear findings and recommendations, and the 
Government acts on them.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you.
    Dr. Parker. So it is just how----
    Mrs. Rodgers. Yes, thank you. I appreciate those insights, 
and I am pleased--I have some other questions I want to get to, 
but I am really pleased that, in Congressman Richard Hudson's 
draft, there's several changes to better incorporate non-
Federal expert stakeholder input and perspectives, and it 
includes people with disabilities as well as healthcare 
professionals with expertise.
    This question is for Dr. Parker and Ms. Arthur. You know, 
as I mentioned in my opening statement, our goal is to ensure 
America is prepared for everything, from a hurricane to a cyber 
attack to a chemical attack by an adversary. And it is critical 
that we take an all-hazards approach as we consider this 
reauthorization. Would you speak briefly as to what if these 
authorizations were allowed to lapse?
    Ms. Arthur. Thank you, Chair Rodgers, for that question.
    I think three really important things would happen if we do 
not pass PAHPA. We will not be better prepared. We will not 
have the incentives that we need to make medical 
countermeasures for the next inevitable pandemic. I think it is 
really, really important to note that we will not--we will lose 
some of the incentives that would be reauthorized. And 
literally, we will miss an opportunity to really instill the 
lessons we learned from COVID into our better laws.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK, thank you. Actually, I am going to move 
on because I want to get to Mr. Okon too, and give him a chance 
to talk a little bit about the drug shortages, because this is 
not a new issue, and I know that it is worse now than from the 
last time you testified over 10 years ago.
    Your testimony indicates that the economics of the sterile 
generic drug market is at the heart of this issue. And I just 
wanted to ask if you would speak some more to that issue and 
how we can help patients afford healthcare while making sure 
that companies invest in manufacturing and get this back into 
the United States.
    Mr. Okon. Well, I will read you a quote from the FDA 
Commissioner, Chair Rodgers, who testified in front of Energy 
and Commerce last month: ``If I offered you the chance to 
produce a drug and guaranteed you would lose money on every 
pill you made, it is unlikely you would go into that business, 
and you might also skimp on your quality systems and 
manufacturing, which then leads, when we do inspections, to 
find problems.''
    I am not saying that some of the solutions advanced in 
terms of early warning and signs and things like that aren't 
important to know. But I believe very strongly--and 11 years 
ago, Scott Gottlieb, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who testified next to 
me, we didn't know each other--came to the same conclusions. If 
you listen to Dr. Gottlieb on different news shows lately, he 
is saying the same thing: the root cause of this is financial.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you.
    Mr. Okon. And we need to bring manufacturing back to the 
United States.
    Mrs. Rodgers. More to come, for sure, but I just want to 
end by saying that I am troubled that less than half of the 
FDA-registered facilities are complying with existing 
requirements to report the volume of what is made in each 
facility. Companies need to be complying with current law, and 
FDA needs to be enforcing before we consider new requirements 
and authorities.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. The Chair yields back. The Chair 
now recognizes the ranking member of the full committee for 5 
minutes for questions.
    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I just want to 
repeat that I do not agree with my Republican colleagues that 
PAHPA reauthorization legislation isn't the place to address 
our vulnerable supply chain. And unfortunately, they have 
instead focused on this partisan request-for-information 
process that I think kicks the can down the road and refuses to 
address the challenges with any urgency. Unfortunately, they 
don't seem to appreciate the security threat that is posed by 
having a constant rotation of critical drugs and medical 
devices in short supply.
    So, Dr. Gralow--quickly, because I have other questions--
can you explain why the American Society of Clinical Oncology 
views drug shortages as a matter of national security and why 
we should address it through the PAHPA reauthorization?
    Dr. Gralow. We have viewed this as a matter of national 
security for years and years now, actually had a summit with 
all stakeholders back in 2018, where we called this a matter of 
national security. Not having the drugs we need available to 
our patients, to the American public, is a matter of national 
security.
    Mr. Pallone. And did the drug shortage get worse during the 
COVID-19 pandemic?
    And how did that affect patient care? Again, quickly, if 
you could.
    Dr. Gralow. There are some very specific drugs that were 
made worse during the pandemic, not to the degree that we have 
right now with these two drugs, cisplatin and carboplatin. But 
the pandemic disrupted supply chains, et cetera, and we were 
very vulnerable. It is actually amazing we didn't do worse with 
many of our drugs, getting them into our country during the 
pandemic.
    Mr. Pallone. Well, thank you.
    You know, I have to say, Mr. Okon, I am not going to ask 
you a question, but it just seems like you just, you know, 
blame everything in this drug shortage on financial problems 
that the drug companies face. And, you know, at one point you 
said that, you know, they are not making enough money, they--
you know, we shouldn't have price caps, we shouldn't have 
rebates.
    You know, if the suggestion here--maybe it is not--is that 
we should just give them all the money they need and we should 
just keep paying them more and more, I mean, I just 
categorically reject that.
    And keep in mind, I mean, you said that this is a financial 
problem, and I agree it is, but it is not a financial problem 
for the drug companies, it is a financial problem for the 
people who can't afford the drugs. And if--the fact of the 
matter is, if drugs are not affordable, people aren't going to 
have access to them, and they are not going to be able to do--
to have that medication.
    So, you know, it is--and I know you didn't say this, but it 
does bother me that in the last week now we have had two 
companies--one, Merck, which is actually very close to my 
district, and then the Chamber of Commerce--sue over the IRA 
provision that provides for negotiated prices. It just seems 
like there is this constant effort by drug companies and their 
supporters--the Chamber of Commerce and others--to simply say 
that there shouldn't be any restrictions, no rebates, no caps, 
no negotiated prices. And I just categorically reject that, 
because if we don't do those things, then these drugs are not 
going to be affordable to the people. It is very nice to say 
the drug companies need more money, but as they continue to 
raise their prices, people just can't afford the drugs and they 
go without.
    But in any case, I probably took up too much time. But I 
just wanted to say that I think it is--well, let me just say 
that, even with their current authorities, FDA has reported 
that in 2021 the agency worked with manufacturers to prevent 
more than 300 shortages. But the agency recognizes they can do 
more if processes were streamlined and the agency could access 
better information.
    So let me just ask you, Dr. Gralow, do you think it is 
overly burdensome to ask drug manufacturers to report, disclose 
the foreign suppliers they rely on to make their drugs, or to 
require drug manufacturers to notify the agency if there is an 
unexpected uptick in demand that could lead to a shortage?
    Dr. Gralow. No, I don't think that is overly burdensome. I 
think it is critical. I think we need transparency, and we need 
to know whether we have redundancy in where we get the raw 
ingredients from. We know we have four or five manufacturers of 
a drug, but if they all get it from the same basic place and 
that one plant goes down, we don't know that. We need that 
transparency, and that is not overly burdensome to know that.
    Mr. Pallone. And--thank you. And, you know, I would just 
tell--say to our Republican leadership on the committee, we 
came together on price transparency provisions a couple of 
weeks ago dealing with hospitals, dealing with PBMs, dealing 
with so many things. I don't think it is--that asking to deal 
with the transparency in this case is really any different, and 
should be something that is done now.
    But thank you, and I yield back.
    Mr. Guthrie. The ranking member yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes Mr. Burgess for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr. Burgess. Thank you, so much to get to--and I will 
probably run out of time, so I will just warn you in advance I 
will be submitting significant questions for written responses.
    You know, as I sit here and listen to this discussion--and 
I get some deja vu--in 2017 and 2018 we actually worked on the 
Pandemic All-Hazard Preparedness Act. Because of a hold by a 
Senator who will be--remain nameless, it didn't actually pass 
that Congress, it passed immediately in the next Congress. It 
was signed into law. And then 6 months later, we have the 
pandemic, and this committee never did an implementation 
hearing of the last version of the Pandemic All-Hazard 
Preparedness Act. So I certainly welcome this discussion today. 
It is long overdue. Heaven help us if we don't learn some of 
the lessons from last time.
    Dr. Parker, thank you for being here today. As always, you 
provide very insightful testimony. I noted in your written 
testimony you talked about the appropriation that was made--I 
think it was the Department of Defense appropriation in 2005--
to provide the migration from egg-based flu vaccine to cell-
based flu vaccine. I am still waiting. I appreciate your work 
on that, but it has--that has been slow in development. But it 
just underscores how important these issues are and why we need 
to focus on them, and we can't let them out of our sight.
    Now, one of the bills that we have got in front of us--the 
so-called Disease X bill, providing some countermeasures for 
emerging viral pathogens and viral families--how would this 
authority have affected our ability to respond during this last 
coronavirus pandemic?
    Dr. Parker. Well, I think, had we had Disease X 5 years 
before the pandemic, we would have been better prepared. You 
know, nonetheless, Operation Warp Speed was--I think history 
will show--it was a tremendous success. But having the ability 
to think about being--we will be surprised in the future, and 
that is why we need Disease X authorization appropriations. 
That is the bottom line.
    Mr. Burgess. Yes, I--the thing that keeps me up at night is 
I don't know how many emergency use authorizations it took from 
the FDA to keep us alive in the last pandemic. If we need, 
what, 250 relaxations of the regulations in order to not die 
during a pandemic, maybe we ought to emulate the Operation Warp 
Speed model that you continually address. And I couldn't agree 
more with you about that.
    On the pandemic itself--and staying with you, Dr. Parker--
the--one of the problems in lack of preparedness was diagnostic 
testing. Are we in a position to do better if something happens 
in the future?
    Dr. Parker. Well, that is a good question. Thank you. And I 
don't have the confidence to say we would do better. I think I 
think the community, the diagnostic community, is--certainly 
those lessons observed are fresh on everybody's mind, so we 
probably will. But I think anything you can do in the PAHPA 
reauthorizations to more guarantee that we will do better and 
engage the private sector very early in the diagnostics--but, 
you know, before we have a crisis--will help us.
    Mr. Burgess. It is just hard to prepare for that when the 
CDC's test absolutely failed first crack out of the box, and we 
really weren't given any information on that for the first 
month of the pandemic, and we lost a lot of time that South 
Korea didn't lose, Japan didn't lose, and then we were always 
compared unfavorably with the response of other countries.
    Mr. Okon, thank you for being here today, and I do remember 
your testimony from 12 years ago, and I think we talked about 
Doxil during that, and now we have got--Doxil is an anticancer 
drug that, because of a manufacturing problem, the manufacturer 
just said, ``I am sorry, I am out,'' and so it wasn't available 
to your patients in this country. And we do need to do better 
on that.
    But many of the drugs that you went through in your 
testimony, these are infused drugs. These are what I call part 
B drugs. They are generally given in a doctor's office. And I 
was really concerned we did the Inflation Reduction Act and the 
movement from average sales price to the maximum fair price, 
which is actually just a made-up number by the Secretary of 
Health, and how this would impact not just the availability of 
drugs themselves but the availability of providers to provide 
those drugs. Was I correct to be concerned about that?
    Mr. Okon. You were, but especially on the side of creating 
a different reimbursement rate, but especially related to the 
sterile, low-cost injectable generics. We have taken the 
pricing power. These are not brands, these are not the Merck 
brands and the other brands, as you know, Dr. Burgess. These 
are very low-cost, sterile drugs that have been around for 
decades.
    Mr. Burgess. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I will submit my further 
questions for the record. Thank you.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. The gentleman yields back. The 
Chair recognizes Mr. Sarbanes for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank all 
of you.
    As we have all made very clear, the PAHPA reauthorization 
provides the perfect opportunity to take a good, hard look at 
the lessons learned from the pandemic and leverage them to 
ensure we are all the more prepared to effectively, 
efficiently, and nimbly respond to the next public health 
crisis.
    Public health departments are often the first line of 
defense against emerging outbreaks. We saw this during the 
pandemic and other public health threats, yet they have been 
severely underresourced for decades. I mean, this is an old 
narrative. And it took significant effort to build them up 
during the pandemic. We were not starting from a strong 
baseline, and it was a very uneven baseline across the country. 
We lost a lot of time as a result of that.
    But similarly, data collection and sharing efforts are a 
very--and I think most--effective way of spotting trends, 
understanding where we need public health resources, and when 
we need them. Public and private entities expanded significant 
energy to create these new systems during the pandemic that 
allowed us to track the spread of COVID-19 vaccines and other 
resources across communities, the country, and the world. There 
were some very effective dashboards built in that regard, as 
you know.
    While we all recognize we are in a very different place now 
than we were just 3 years ago today, it is critical that we not 
let our guard down--this is much of the theme of today's 
hearing--as we draw down our emergency postures. If we are 
going to be ready for the next public health crisis, we need to 
ensure that we maintain a base level infrastructure of the 
public health workforce data and other capacities that we built 
up during the pandemic.
    Dr. Washington, as an epidemiologist and the vice chair of 
the Big Cities Health Coalition, you, of course, are acutely 
aware of the challenges that have faced public health 
departments during the pandemic and those that will face them 
in the future. In your testimony you said it is best: ``A well-
functioning public health system is pandemic preparedness, and 
must be well resourced at all levels of government before, 
during, and after emergencies.'' As I say, I think you said 
that best.
    What does it look like to strike the necessary balance 
between a return to normalcy, which we all seek--crave, 
really--and maintaining adequate preparedness for the next 
public health crisis? And how can we achieve this in PAHPA 
reauthorization?
    Dr. Washington. Certainly. So I think we are--the most 
important thing is we have learned a ton of lessons in COVID, 
and we made a lot of investments in COVID. Many of those 
investments are short term and term limited, and many of them 
come in various mechanisms, and they are fragmented a lot of 
different ways. And so it is really important for us to 
recognize that we did all that for a reason: because the 
emergency required us to do it, and we needed those things to 
respond. And so shame on us to not have a system in place 
already for the next emergency, which could come next month or 
later this year. And so we need to--us in public health, we 
must maintain that emergency posture, we must have preparedness 
plans, we must be in place.
    Currently, we don't receive direct funding for many of our 
preparedness initiatives. Much of that goes directly to the 
State and then eventually comes to us from the State. As you 
can imagine, that is tons of administrative burden that it 
takes to get funding from the Feds to the State to us. And we--
if we are not prepared, I fear that the next pandemic will have 
a similar kind of response.
    Mr. Sarbanes. I appreciate that. And the pandemic made 
clear that we have to work hand in glove with our State and 
local partners to truly adopt a systemwide, whole-of-government 
approach to public health preparedness.
    Dr. Gralow, why is it so important that we capitalize on 
the opportunity we have before us with PAHPA reauthorization to 
fully address both supply- and demand-side lessons learned from 
the pandemic?
    If we do one without the other, we will be sacrificing the 
overall efficacy of our public health preparedness efforts. 
Isn't that correct?
    Dr. Gralow. I would agree. I think this is a crisis. It is 
a different kind of crisis. It is definitely intertwined with 
pandemic-related issues. The vulnerabilities, the transparency 
that we are asking for are--were exacerbated by the pandemic.
    I think this is a national security issue. I think it ties 
into many of the issues that we have been dealing with 
throughout the whole pandemic and the authorizations that have 
been provided.
    Mr. Sarbanes. I mean, really, it is shame on us if we don't 
maximize our learning opportunity here from what we just went 
through to make sure, again, we create a new floor or 
foundation baseline in terms of how we build the public health 
and response infrastructure across the country, so that when 
the next challenge comes we are not going from a deficit up to 
where we need to be, we are starting from a strong baseline.
    Thank you all for your testimony. I yield back.
    Mr. Griffith [presiding]. I now recognize the gentleman 
from Ohio, Mr. Latta, for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Latta. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks for--
our witnesses, for your testimony today. We all appreciate you 
being here.
    I have been a member of this committee the last two 
reauthorizations of PAHPA, and look forward to supporting the 
much-needed provisions to improve the legislation so Americans 
are safer and our Nation is better prepared to respond to any 
future public health emergencies.
    To that end, I am proud that my legislation, the Healing 
Response Act, that I am coleading with my good friend from 
Illinois, was included in today's hearing. It is crucial that 
Congress has a formal review examining HHS's efforts to ensure 
that the U.S. is prepared to rapidly produce medical 
countermeasures in the event of a public health emergency, and 
better understand risks and challenges associated with advanced 
development.
    I also appreciate the committee's longstanding bipartisan 
work and our ability to work together for the American people.
    I also believe there are some critical improvements to 
ensure BARDA and SNS obtain feedback from all sectors in 
responding to threats through my colleague Mr. Hudson's PHEMCE 
Advisory Committee Act.
    However, although great steps are being made in PAHPA to 
address future emergencies, I am concerned that HHS isn't 
funding programs that improve oral antivirals or next-
generation antivirals. Over $5 billion was pumped into the 
Biden administration's next-gen program. They are spending vast 
amounts of taxpayer dollars to reinforce existing programs like 
vaccine antibodies that contain limitations we have all seen 
clearly over the last 5 years. The--it is imperative that 
taxpayer dollars are spent appropriately, and we must ensure 
that we have access to more therapies and treatments now, not 
at some point down the road.
    And Dr. Parker and Ms. Arthur, if I could ask you both the 
same question, and I will start with Ms. Arthur. What is the 
role Congress should play to invite private-sector solutions 
and new advancements in treating rare diseases into the 
decision making today, and ensure our tax dollars are spent 
more wisely?
    Ms. Arthur. Thank you for that question. I am not a rare 
disease expert, but I think that incentives are always 
important with regard to encouraging the development of novel 
products. Many of our companies are very committed to this 
space, and find that it is important to have those incentives 
at the FDA and also with other parts of the U.S. Government to 
help development of rare disease products.
    Mr. Latta. Dr. Parker?
    Dr. Parker. Yes, the same thing. I think you have to have 
the clear incentives to bring industry in. But I think, from 
the Government side, you also have to have effective leadership 
that is going to establish what are the priorities, what are 
the milestones, what are the metrics, and hold the executive 
branch accountable for delivering.
    Mr. Latta. Well, let me follow up with what you just said, 
because this is going to lead into my next question, because 
when you look at the regulatory issues or legislative barriers 
that are hindering private-sector innovations, how does the 
private sector communicating with the Federal Government and 
the Federal agencies make sure that those barriers are 
overcome?
    Dr. Parker. Well, you know, I am not going to--there are 
actually--there are opportunities for the private sector and, 
say, BARD to communicate. They have mechanisms to do that. I 
think we always have to work on how we can make those better, 
and how does our Federal funding agencies--are they listening 
to industry when they express their concerns and barriers that 
they have to face?
    So we are--always have to push and make our communication 
channels better.
    Mr. Latta. Ms. Arthur, would you like to follow up on that?
    Ms. Arthur. Yes, thank you. I think, first, I very much 
support what Representative Hudson has put forward as far as 
the PHEMCE Advisory group. I think that is an example of the 
kind of work we can do as industry, where we actually, through 
our trade associations and--directly, actually, can give 
guidance to the Federal Government on those things that would 
make it easier, or facilitate the development of products that 
have an unmet medical need.
    This is really what we like to do. We respond to guidance 
from the FDA, we work closely with those advisory groups in 
order to say this will help us deliver on the need that has 
been expressed.
    Mr. Latta. Well, thank you very much.
    And Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
    Mr. Guthrie [presiding]. The gentleman yields back. The 
Chair recognizes Mr. Cardenas for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you very much, Chairman Guthrie, and 
also I want to thank Ranking Member Eshoo for holding this 
hearing, and to all of our witnesses for sharing your 
perspectives and expertise on hazard preparedness.
    I spoke in the last hearing about the vulnerabilities of 
pediatric populations during emergencies. I remain concerned 
that our healthcare infrastructure is not equipped to handle 
surges when hazards impact children--especially children.
    Since this past winter, when we saw skyrocketing cases of 
RSV flu and COVID-19, little investment has been made in 
building capacity to address these needs in the future. And 
looking at existing programs and resources, I want to ask about 
some creative ways that we might be able to leverage our 
current systems and better address the needs of our kids.
    Dr. Washington, you have been on the front lines of COVID-
19 responses in your community. In your experience responding 
to the needs of children during these public health 
emergencies, how critical is it to have trained healthcare 
professionals to address the unique needs of kids?
    And what challenges have you witnessed in recruiting and 
retaining a workforce with pediatric-specific knowledge?
    Dr. Washington. Great, thank you for the question. I think 
it is certainly important that we have folks with experience to 
be able to care for children.
    And I know one real opportunity for us is on the pediatric 
infectious disease doctor front. It is really important to have 
those available to us. We are fortunate to have some in our 
community, but I know that is not the case for many communities 
in the country, and it remains really important.
    The most important workforce issue, though, as it relates 
to our response, really, is our nursing and clinical support 
and having nursing available. As you know, we are experiencing 
a national shortage of nurses. We have the same experience in 
Mecklenburg in the State of North Carolina. And having nurses 
available to deliver vaccines, to work in shelters, to provide 
care to families, to work in schools--all really critical, 
important, and must be addressed as we think about preparing 
our workforce.
    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you. To what extent would something 
like pediatric toolkits, which would include, for example, 
equipment, training modules, and pediatric dosages of 
therapeutics, help to handle a surge capacity for children 
during a crisis?
    Dr. Washington. I think those are really--toolkits are 
really important guidance documents to help clinicians and 
nonclinician settings to be able to provide care for children 
during emergencies.
    I think back to COVID, where we had to have guidance 
documents for child care facilities, for example, where you 
have nonclinical staff working to serve and care for kids every 
day. Having appropriate guidance for those individuals to be 
able to care for those kids while experiencing a pandemic is so 
critical to our response.
    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you. I was also--I wanted to discuss 
the need to improve reliability of our drug supply chains. It 
is a glaring, missed opportunity that the Republican majority 
is leaving the FDA out of the process. Partisan RFI is not the 
same as taking action, especially not when the FDA has proposed 
a number of improvements to help them deal with drug shortages.
    Over the course of the pandemic, we saw how quickly 
critical supplies and over-the-counter medications could become 
scarce. Now we are confronting a shortage of oncology drugs so 
serious physicians are rationing drugs or delaying care to 
patients in dire need.
    It is undeniable that FDA could have more of a role to play 
in preventing these types of shortages in the future, and the 
omission of FDA-related authority is stunning, which leads me 
to a question to you, Dr. Gralow.
    What kind of FDA authorities would have been most helpful 
in avoiding the existing shortage, and what could help FDA 
mitigate the current shortage?
    Dr. Gralow. Again, I think most helpful would be to have 
the authority to know where manufacturers source their active 
pharmaceutical ingredients and being able to view whether we 
actually have redundancy in our system or not. Knowing at the 
first time point that a plant has gone down, and then 
understanding that it impacts five of the manufacturers or one 
of the manufacturers is critical. And that is what we are 
hoping FDA will get authority to do.
    Mr. Cardenas. Yes, one of the things that, unfortunately, I 
think most Americans see as a bad term is redundancy. Like, why 
would you want to duplicate something? But in this context it 
is critical, and it would be lifesaving, and it is something 
that systems in general are required to do. Unfortunately, we 
can do a better job in this country. Hopefully, we will get 
there.
    You note, Dr. Gralow, that shortages today are the worst 
you have seen in over 30 years--in your 30-year career. Without 
congressional action, how likely or frequent would we expect 
these shortages to be in the future?
    Dr. Gralow. They are increasing regularly. And, you know, 
the rest of world does not have a shortage of these two primary 
drugs that we are dealing with right now, and it is because of 
many of the other systems' better redundancy, et cetera, that 
they don't. This is--cisplatin, carboplatin, this is a U.S. 
problem.
    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you very much.
    My time having expired, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Guthrie. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes Mr. Griffith for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr. Griffith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I beg your 
forgiveness and the forgiveness of the witnesses because I am 
going to go on a little bit of a tirade for just a minute.
    One of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seemed 
somewhat surprised, chagrined that Merck has filed suit against 
the so-called negotiation process that they set up. When that 
bill first came into this body, into this committee, this 
subcommittee 3 years ago, on first blush I raised the issue 
that when you take between 65 and 95 percent of the total sales 
of a medication, it is, on its face, unconstitutional and would 
likely face a challenge in the courts. I raised it again in 
full committee. I raised it on the floor. And for 3 years, 
every time it came up, I raised it, and it was included in the 
IRA. And to say today that you are somehow surprised took me by 
surprise, because my thought is of course Merck sued, and every 
drug manufacturer probably ought to sue because it is, on its 
face, an unconstitutional taking.
    All right. Now the questions I actually had prepared. Thank 
you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, witnesses.
    In my district, a company had a contract facilitated by HHS 
to produce nitrile, butadiene, rubber--the main ingredient in 
disposable gloves--as well as the finished gloves. They were 
directed by the Federal Government officials to submit two 
separate proposals to both the Department of Defense and the 
Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, or ASPR. 
They were assured that this was for process reasons, and funds 
would be available for them to complete the contract, which 
included new construction to expand their production 
capabilities.
    So the county donated hundreds of acres of land valued at 
over 17 million, and the Commonwealth of Virginia provided tens 
of millions of dollars' worth of incentives. Since then the 
company has only received partial funding and has had to halt 
construction, and my district is left with hundreds of acres 
unused, and half--and a half-built manufacturing facility. This 
was largely due, in part, to a lack communications between ASPR 
and the Department of Defense, and a lack--and a lapse and a 
lack of transparency.
    Now, in the flowchart--this is mostly for folks back home; 
I know you all know this--but in the flowchart of 
responsibility, both the Biomedical Advanced Research and 
Development Authority, BARDA, and the Strategic National 
Stockpile, SNS, are directly under ASPR. Accordingly, I have 
two bills in front of us this hearing that will provide 
structure around contract duration, as well as require 90-day 
notification requirement to vendors in the case of any 
modifications, renewals, extensions, or terminations of 
contracts with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development 
Authority and the Strategic National Stockpile. It is my 
understanding this contract notice requirement is already 
required for contracts under the SNS's Special Reserve Fund.
    Dr. Parker, can you please explain what processes are in 
place currently within ASPR to notify companies of any 
modification or changes to their existing contracts?
    Dr. Parker. Well, I am not currently in ASPR or----
    Mr. Griffith. I understand.
    Dr. Parker [continuing]. Or Federal Government, it has been 
a while.
    But what you just described sounds like a reasonable thing 
to have in place that, you know, it just--increasing the 
transparency with the private sector, with those who are doing 
business with the Government, it is a two-way street between 
the private sector and the Federal funding agency.
    Mr. Griffith. And it is along the same line, but can you 
explain why providing more stability and certainty for 
companies when contracting with ASPR, BARDA, SNS would be 
beneficial for both taxpayers and also the company who 
initially receives the contract?
    And I probably already answered it in my description of 
what is happening in my district, but go ahead.
    Dr. Parker. Yes, and I am not familiar with the case in 
your district, but that sounds very, very unfortunate, and it 
sounds like a huge communication issue. But I do think that 
speaks to the issue of the fragmentation between the Federal 
interagency--you know, the interagency and, you know, in this 
case DoD and HHS. So that needs to be fixed.
    Mr. Griffith. Yes, and I appreciate that, and we are going 
to try to fix that.
    And to go back and harp some more, it wasn't just me, there 
were others who came forward on the situation with the drug 
pricing so-called negotiations. When you put a gun to 
somebody's head, it is not really a negotiation. And even the 
Congressional Research Service came out with a statement that 
they thought it was not only an unconstitutional taking--was 
possibly, because they are never going to commit to the final 
result of the court--but not only was it possibly an unlawful 
taking, but it was also probably in violation of the excessive 
prohibitions that are found elsewhere in the first 10 
amendments of the United States Constitution.
    And interestingly, Merck has also sued because there--
apparently, there is a regulation or a rule that has come out 
you are not supposed to talk about how unfair it is, and you 
could even lose your rights to sell other medicines to the 
Federal Government, all of which seems atrocious, and I expect 
the courts to knock it down, and I am shocked that anybody 
would not understand there is at least a huge argument to be 
made in the courts.
    And I yield back.
    Mr. Guthrie. The gentleman yields back. The Chair 
recognizes the gentlelady from Michigan, Mrs. Dingell, for 5 
minutes.
    Mrs. Dingell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member 
Eshoo. This is an important hearing, and I thank all the 
witnesses.
    The reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards 
Preparedness Act, or PAHPA, comes at a very critical moment. 
Our Nation is emerging from a 3-year public health emergency, 
the worst healthcare crisis we have experienced in a century. 
And it is our obligation to improve our Nation's preparedness 
and response capabilities to ensure we are ready for future 
pandemics.
    We have to learn from our shortcomings, address the gaps in 
our Nation's health security, and remain entirely focused on 
mitigating the effects of the next possible threat. That is not 
a matter of if, it is a matter of when. And that is why I am so 
very disappointed that this markup is not considering any 
legislation to address the FDA.
    I remain seriously troubled about the fragility of the 
pharmaceutical supply chain. It is not only compromising our 
response to future pandemics but, as we all know, it is harming 
Americans now. We are in the midst of an oncology drug shortage 
that is jeopardizing the health of cancer patients across the 
Nation. And in Michigan we are experiencing it very seriously. 
A number of our hospitals have already canceled appointments 
for cancer patients because there isn't even a substitute 
medicine. They are being switched to alternative medications 
that aren't effective either.
    Dr. Gralow, in the wake of a drug shortage, what are the 
implications of switching an oncology patient to a new 
medication?
    Dr. Gralow. In some cases the agents that are in shortage 
or out, they not on the shelves right now, are critical to 
getting cures.
    Testicular cancer is an example. Even metastatic testicular 
cancer, when it spread to other parts of the body, can be 
cured. But a critical component of that cure is cisplatin. So 
at this point, not having that drug--we have no substitutes for 
that drug in this particular case, in testicular cancer, a 
chance where--a cancer where, if we do have this drug, you can 
be cured even when it has spread, you know, beyond the origin.
    So this is critical, impacting maybe as many as half a 
million Americans with just these two drugs. And there are many 
other drugs that are vulnerable right now that are on the list 
of impending shortage or problems brewing.
    Mrs. Dingell. Thank you. Unfortunately, many patients don't 
have weeks or months to wait for these lifesaving drugs, and we 
are passing up a critical opportunity to address this problem 
in earnest today.
    A crucial piece of this puzzle is examining the FDA's role 
in mitigating drug shortages, and I urge my colleagues in a 
bipartisan way for us to seriously consider improvements to the 
FDA in the weeks ahead.
    But now let me turn to another issue: our Nation's testing 
capacity. Getting swift test results was vital in our pandemic 
response and keeping our loved ones safe. But during the peaks 
of the pandemic, we all heard these alarming reports of it 
taking up for 2 weeks to patients to receive their test 
results, indicating whether they had tested positive for COVID-
19.
    Dr. Parker, in your testimony you mentioned the need for 
improved surgical situational awareness and supply chain 
resiliency that can be activated immediately. This has to 
include our lab testing capabilities. Dr. Parker, are our 
country's public labs designed to process a large volume of 
tests?
    And were they able to handle the testing surges we 
experienced throughout the public health emergency?
    Dr. Parker. Well, I think, clearly, at the beginning of the 
pandemic, that was--the answer was no.
    I think we have to prepare our--in the future that they 
will be, and they have to be able to surge into the private 
sector to help that. I think the example earlier, South Korea 
was better prepared, but I think they also had a pretty good 
integration between their public health laboratories and the 
private sector that helped them out. We need to do something 
very similar.
    Mrs. Dingell. Thank you, Dr. Parker.
    The Secretary is permitted to enter into contracts or 
cooperative agreements with vendors to maintain the Strategic 
National Stockpile and ensure it is ready to handle surges. 
However, clinical laboratories are not directly included, which 
is alarming, since we need robust lab capacity to process these 
important tests. That is why I am glad a bill I am leading with 
Representative Dunn was included as part of this hearing: the 
Ensuring Sufficient Supply of Testing Act.
    And thank you, Rep. Dunn, for your partnership on this 
important effort.
    This bill will expressly clarify that the Secretary can 
enter into contracts with clinical labs to strengthen our 
testing capacity.
    I am almost out of time, but Dr. Parker, some estimates say 
private labs handled up to 85 percent of U.S. COVID-19 tests. 
Can we better leverage their capabilities to improve testing 
capacity during surges?
    Dr. Parker. Well, the answer is yes, and the answer is we 
have to. And we also--there is a lot of university hospital 
laboratories that need to be considered into this--into that 
equation too.
    Mrs. Dingell. Thank you, Dr. Parker.
    I yield back, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. The gentlelady yields back. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Bilirakis, for 
5 minutes for questions.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it.
    Ms. Arthur, your testimony brought up a sobering question: 
As a nation, are we more prepared to do--are we more prepared 
than we were in 2019?
    And that, unfortunately, I don't think we are. I think part 
of this reason is due to the administration's red tape and 
reliance on bureaucracy. What we should be doing is replicating 
one of our COVID successes through public-private sector 
partnerships, in my opinion.
    Could you elaborate on the agile nature of the private 
sector, and specifically your members? What does their 
nimbleness mean in the testing and diagnostics space?
    Ms. Arthur. I think--thank you very much for that question.
    I think, across the board, industry actually does several 
things really well. They analyze what they can do to solve a 
problem. They understand what the--what they need to do to 
bring the best product to market that is going to serve the 
need, that unmet medical need, being met. And more importantly, 
they move really swiftly to make go/no-go decisions.
    So you build a test, you see if it works, you understand if 
there's safety issues, and you move on to the next step clearly 
and swiftly. And I think that is what we saw with Operation 
Warp Speed, was there was that facilitated environment by the 
U.S. Government and then expertise brought to bear by industry 
on how to make those very rapid go/no-go decisions, all within 
the confines of very clear guidance for manufacturers of 
vaccines, tests, and therapeutics, such that companies were 
delivering products swiftly but still very safely and 
manufactured at high quality.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Excellent. Dr. Parker, you similarly speak 
to the role that coordination plays in responding to novel 
threats that could catch us flat-footed and unprepared, God 
forbid, specifically the importance of relationships not only 
between the Federal Government and the private sector but also 
with State and local governments.
    The Countermeasures Advisory Committee bill also requires 
the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise 
to solicit State and local feedback as part of its decision 
making. Can you discuss the role of State and local feedback in 
addressing a community's specific needs during the acute 
emergent situations such as natural disasters or disease 
outbreaks?
    Dr. Parker. Sure, and Dr. Washington is on the front line, 
and it is absolutely essential that the Federal Government 
include input from those that are on the front line in State, 
local public health, particularly Tribal and--Territorial and 
Tribal communities as well. It is just absolutely essential, 
and we need to have that input. Essentially, they are setting 
the requirements.
    I always think of things in the requirements space, and 
that drives what our funding should do. So they should be 
helping us drive those requirements.
    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you.
    Mr. Okon, on the topic of preparedness and prevention of 
supply chain disruptions, you talk in your testimony about the 
need to incentivize--and we went over this, but I want to ask 
you--again, the need to incentivize generic drug injectable 
manufacturing, reshoring here in the United States through 
value-based incentives. Can you elaborate more on this idea, 
sir?
    Mr. Okon. Well, value-based, Mr. Bilirakis, value-based is 
the name in healthcare now.
    And basically, over 75 percent of these drugs are 
manufactured overseas. We need to bring it back in the United 
States, and we need to basically have acceptable quality 
measures which are agreed upon. And when a manufacturer hits 
those quality measures, keeps the products going, keeps the 
production lines going, then they would basically get an 
incentive there.
    Let me just make this very clear. This is not about big-
name, expensive, brand drugs. This is about low-cost, sterile 
injectables. It is a very different animal. And the people and 
the companies that are making this are very different than some 
of the large manufacturers out there. These come from China, 
India, and whatnot.
    So I think, if we thought creatively in terms of value-
based arrangements, we would be able to bring manufacturing 
back in the United States. But the fact of the matter is, 
again, the FDA Commissioner said it: If no one is going to make 
money on these drugs, they are not going to produce them. It is 
as simple as that.
    And I am not against any of the warning signals, the things 
that the FDA should be doing and whatnot, but the problem is, 
until we realize the fact that there is a basic financial issue 
here, we are going to have more shortages.
    Mr. Bilirakis. OK, thank you very much. I appreciate that 
answer.
    And I should probably yield back the balance of my time in 
the interest of time. Thank you.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. The gentleman's time has expired. 
The gentleman yields back. The Chair now recognizes the 
gentlelady from Illinois, Ms. Kelly, for 5 minutes for 
questions.
    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    The COVID-19 pandemic really highlighted the need to 
support and protect our public health infrastructure. COVID-19 
was, hopefully, a once-in-100-year phenomenon, but we continue 
to see that there is always a public health threat looming, 
from the yearly flu season to the continued threat of Mpox. 
Just last week there was the air quality threat in the 
northeastern part of the country. Regardless of what and where 
it is, our public health infrastructure stands ready to 
confront the situation and ensure that Americans say stay safe 
and healthy.
    Dr. Washington, in your testimony you speak about the need 
to build a more robust, interoperable data and analytic public 
health system. How can the Federal Government support the 
efforts to build out a national data infrastructure for all 
hazards--hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, not just pandemics--
that is capable of efficiently sharing important public health 
information among providers and Federal, State, and local 
agencies?
    Dr. Washington. Thank you for that question.
    It is so essential that we have a reliable data system. I 
akin it to being a pilot or without data on wind or weather, 
right, in trying to fly a plane. I don't think any of us would 
get on a plane without the pilot having that information to 
make decisions. And so I feel like our public health system has 
got to have the same kind of infrastructure in place to be able 
to make decisions not just at the Federal level but also at the 
State and local levels.
    And we have got to make intentional investments in those 
systems that exist both at the Federal level, State, and at the 
local level, and it has to happen at all three levels. We can't 
just have a Federal system, we can't just have data systems at 
the State level. We have got to all have access to information 
that can flow very quickly so that we are not making decisions 
a month later from the information that we have in front of us. 
And so I think it is so vital.
    And I do think it is important, though, as it has been 
highlighted in this hearing today, that we also partner with 
the private sector. There is a lot of analytic capability, 
technology solutions that the private sector has to offer, and 
we should leverage that for the good of government and to 
protect our people.
    Ms. Kelly. And would--can you also speak a bit on what 
additional cybersecurity enhancements need to happen currently 
while we are building out the national data infrastructure?
    Dr. Washington. Yes, I think any national data 
infrastructure has got to have, as a priority, as part of its 
requirements, appropriate guardrails for cybersecurity. Living 
in a jurisdiction that has had a hack before, it is so 
important that we prioritize, just like we prioritize any other 
healthcare information, data security. And so it is essential 
that those systems that are built address cybersecurity and 
protect that information, just like we would any other 
information, both health, financial, or otherwise.
    Ms. Kelly. Thank you.
    As we take this moment to reflect on what this country 
experienced, the lingering question is if we are prepared to 
address another pandemic. This is one of the many reasons that 
I am proud to cosponsor, as my colleague said, H.R. 3703, the 
Healing Act of 2023, with Rep. Bob Latta, which would direct 
the U.S. Comptroller General to review and issue 
recommendations regarding the current status of existing 
efforts and programs rapidly to produce medical countermeasures 
domestically.
    Dr. Parker, in your testimony you speak about the need for 
near-real-time situational awareness in the countermeasure 
resiliency efforts. Can you expand on the current gaps of our 
public health structure to have the near-real-time situational 
awareness?
    And what additional authorities does Congress need to give 
it to ensure that we have better visibility into our system?
    Dr. Parker. Well, sure, and it is very similar to Dr. 
Washington. You know, the need to have modern data systems that 
can protect intellectual property and competitive information, 
but when the need comes can be turned on to share the 
appropriate information for the entire response enterprise.
    And I want to just share something during COVID-19 that few 
people saw. You know, it took about 6 months to set up, but 
within HHS and the whole family of HHS and the interagency, the 
data systems were remarkable. And many of us were calling that 
the heartbeat of the response because of the visibility and the 
control tower concept that we could almost begin to anticipate 
where needs were before the request even came in. And we need 
that kind of system, the control tower system. We need to 
protect intellectual property and competitive information, but 
we have done it, we can do this again in the future, and make 
this institutionalized.
    Ms. Kelly. Thank you so much.
    And with that, I yield back.
    Mr. Guthrie. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes Mr. Johnson from Ohio for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Johnson. Well, thank you, Chairman Guthrie. I 
appreciate it for this very important hearing.
    You know, it is with the power of hindsight that we are 
here today talking about how we can be better prepared for the 
next disaster, be it a hurricane, a tornado, or another 
pandemic. The last time the Energy and Commerce Committee 
looked at the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, it was 
2018. And nobody in this room now or then could have predicted 
what was to come: COVID-19.
    Now that we have the coronavirus squarely in our rearview 
mirror, we must take lessons learned. We got to consider what 
those are, both good and bad, and ensure that we are in a 
stronger position to fight the next natural disaster or health 
crisis. But if there is one silver lining, it is the National 
Disaster Medical System, NDMS, or, as I like to think of them, 
the National Guard of medical professionals. When disaster 
strikes and the need for urgent medical care is required, the 
men and women of NDMS are called to action.
    And it is easy to forget that disaster response personnel 
from NDMS respond to all kinds of disasters, not just 
pandemics. For example, just last month those volunteer medical 
professionals were dispatched to Guam in response to a typhoon 
that hit the island. Over 45 NDMS health and medical task force 
and incident management team personnel were deployed to support 
emergency response efforts and ease the burden on local health 
systems, inevitably saving lives.
    The NDMS represents a network of intermittent Federal 
employees who are medical professionals serving within their 
communities, while jumping into action to serve our Nation by 
deploying during natural or man-made disasters. In their 
everyday life, they are the doctors and nurses each of us see 
in our local health systems in our communities.
    Under the last reauthorization, Congress provided direct 
hiring authority to the Administration for Strategic 
Preparedness and Response for the NDMS workforce through 
September 2021. To allow for the most flexibility during COVID-
19 and to combat the dire workforce needs, we have continuously 
extended this authority through one-off, must-pass bills since 
then.
    Jumping from short-term extension to short-term extension 
is not sustainable. We need some certainty. And it hurts their 
overarching recruitment and retainment efforts. So it is for 
these reasons Representative Schrier and I have introduced the 
Doctors at the Ready Act, which will provide for stability and 
certainty at ASPR to ensure this program has the flexibility 
needed to provide for a properly staffed NDMS in the case of an 
emergency.
    So question number one goes to Dr. Parker.
    You know, Dr. Parker, like you I served for 26 years in the 
United States military in the Air Force. So thank you, first 
and foremost, for your service to our country.
    But based on your experience as Principal Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Preparedness and Response, could you further 
elaborate on the challenges posed by this intermittent hiring 
cycle and its impact on the continuity of our preparedness and 
response framework and operations?
    The legislation that Representative Schrier and I have 
introduced would eliminate the sunset permanently, thereby 
providing more stability and flexibility for the program. The 
goal would be to ensure we have civil servants ready to deploy 
when we need them. So can you respond to that----
    Dr. Parker. Sure.
    Mr. Johnson. [continuing]. The challenges?
    Dr. Parker. Sure, and thank you for the question and for 
your--and I commend you for the bill to do this, to strengthen 
NDMS. It is absolutely essential that we do that.
    The NDMS--what makes NDMS work is the health professionals 
across our United States that are volunteering to become 
intermittent civil servants to deploy to help our Nation in 
need. So this is needed, and I would commend any other things 
that would strengthen NDMS. NDMS is a unique national asset 
that the public is not aware of. And we need to strengthen it, 
and we need to think about what does NDMS 2.0 look like.
    Mr. Johnson. OK. Do you think it is going to help? I mean, 
is it going to have the impact that we are hoping it does, 
particularly around recruitment?
    Dr. Parker. Anything you can do to make it more long-term 
and to incentivize the volunteers of our health professionals 
to sign up and participate will be helpful. I think we need to 
think about what other incentives--and I don't know what they 
are right now, off the top of my head, but we need to think 
about other incentives as well, to make sure that we have a 
robust, diverse workforce that will volunteer for NDMS service 
in the future.
    Mr. Johnson. All right. Well, great. Well, thank you very 
much.
    And Mr. Chairman, I urge support for H.R. 3613, the Doctors 
at the Ready Act. And with that, I yield back. Thank you.
    Mr. Guthrie. The gentleman yields back, and the Chair 
recognizes Ms. Barragan from California for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Barragan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Antimicrobial resistance is costing patients their lives 
and significantly increasing our healthcare costs, with an 
estimated $4.6 billion spent annually on treating just 6 of the 
most common, multidrug-resistant pathogens in the United 
States. For all Americans, and especially those who face 
chronic infections, like individuals living with cystic 
fibrosis, this is a public health crisis that Congress can no 
longer ignore.
    As we consider the reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-
Hazards Preparedness Act, or PAHPA, I think this is a missed 
opportunity for the committee to not include the PASTEUR Act, 
or at least certain parts of it. Innovation is urgently needed 
to address the shortage of effective antimicrobials to treat a 
range of resistant infections.
    For example, in California, Valley fever is a growing 
fungal threat and lacks appropriate antifungal treatment. From 
the perspective of these patients, some of whom are my 
constituents, we are unprepared to meet their treatment needs.
    Dr. Arthur, thank you for your testimony. Thank you for 
including this as part of your testimony, your written 
testimony. You provide in it that you believe that we should be 
including the PASTEUR Act in the reauthorization of the 
Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act. I would just ask 
that you elaborate on why it is important that we do that.
    Ms. Arthur. Thank you so much for the question.
    The antimicrobials market is a broken market. And having 
antibiotics available to us is not just pivotal to our public 
health, everyday delivery of public health and surgeries, it is 
also vital in our all-hazards response. When people are injured 
in a fire or other--they can often suffer from opportunistic 
infections. So having antibiotics and antifungals to actually 
treat people in a rapid way is really important.
    What the PASTEUR Act does that is unique is it actually 
enables a marketplace for these products that are being 
developed by industry, sometimes in partnership with BARDA and 
the Government. And so we need to have these products not just 
get developed but go into a place where they can actually be 
sustained and be available to us.
    But that also has to be coupled with very important 
stewardship. We don't want to overuse these. It will drive 
resistance. So you need to actually have both the stewardship 
component and a marketplace that actually helps these products 
be available to us. So it is really important to do something 
like PASTEUR as a policy that will help drive that.
    Ms. Barragan. Well, thank you. And I understand that this 
legislation has broad support of over 230 stakeholder 
organizations representing healthcare providers, public health 
professionals, scientists, patients, and pharmaceutical and 
diagnostics industries per your testimony, is that correct?
    Ms. Arthur. That is actually correct. There are many 
different diseases where antimicrobial infections can cause 
death. So it is really important to support these products.
    Ms. Barragan. Yes, and I also saw at the end of 2022 that 
this bill had over 60 bipartisan cosponsors, which makes it, I 
think, ripe for us to really take a look at and making sure it 
is included. Thank you for that.
    Dr. Washington, in your written testimony you stated that--
and I am quoting--the Hospital Preparedness Program ``has been 
cut by more than 50 percent over the last 20 years and remains 
stretched due to prolonged emergency responses, increased 
preparedness and response requirements, and annual 
discretionary funding not keeping pace with inflation.''
    As the only source of Federal funding for healthcare system 
readiness, I am concerned that the stagnant funding will 
decrease the ability of local hospitals to serve all the 
patients who need care during emergency or disaster. What are 
the practical implications and/or limitations of stagnant 
funding for the Hospital Preparedness Program, and is there 
more Congress can do to help?
    Dr. Washington. So I think there are tons of implications 
specifically for being ready to go. What--as we saw during 
COVID, our healthcare--our acute care facilities were literally 
crushed with demand. Our emergency departments had waits that 
were extending well beyond 10 to 12 hours. And the ability to 
be able to care for people in a timely fashion was almost 
impossible.
    One of the things that our Preparedness Coalition did that 
is funded by HPP in Mecklenburg and our region was to mobilize 
a mobile hospital. We can't just purchase a mobile hospital in 
real time for an emergency. We have to have those things ready 
to go, they have to be well-maintained, and they have to be 
ready to activate as quickly as we need to to be able to 
respond and provide care to folks.
    And so increasing investments in the preparedness of our 
healthcare systems is really, really important. And we haven't 
kept up, and so we need to catch up in order to be able to make 
sure we stay prepared.
    Ms. Barragan. Great. Thank you.
    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Burgess [presiding]. The Chair thanks the gentlelady, 
the gentlelady yields back. The Chair now recognizes Chairman 
Hudson for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Hudson. Thank you very much, and thank you to the 
witnesses. Outstanding testimony today. I think it has been a 
great discussion. I appreciate your time being here today.
    If it wasn't obvious before, COVID has shown us that public 
health security is national security, and all of us in Congress 
owe it to our constituents to get this reauthorization of PAHPA 
done on time this year.
    Ms. Arthur was asked what happens if we don't, and I 
thought you gave a great answer: number one, we will not be 
better prepared for the next pandemic; number two, private 
industry will not have the incentives necessary to produce the 
next generation of countermeasures; and number three, we lose 
the opportunity to implement lessons learned from COVID. I 
think those options are factual, and I think they are totally 
unacceptable.
    We have a responsibility to move this legislation forward, 
and I appreciate the partnership I have had with Ranking Member 
Eshoo. We have worked very hard to make this a bipartisan 
process. There are a lot of factors that I would like to take 
in a different direction, and I am frankly just baffled at the 
place we are now.
    You know, drug shortages is a critical issue. It is an 
issue that Republicans have been addressing, we will continue 
to address. The PREVENTS Act just passed about 6 months ago had 
provisions dealing with drug shortages. It was a bipartisan 
bill led by Richard Burr from the Senate, our ranking member at 
the time, chairman--chairwoman now, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, 
worked very hard on that, working together with Democrats. We 
have had hearings on this issue. We will continue to have 
hearings on this issue. I have personally given assurances that 
I will make this a priority, and we will work together.
    But I think being given a list of bills that we have to 
include or else when I think testimony today showed we are not 
really dealing with the root causes, we--I think we need to 
examine this further to really, truly address this in a 
comprehensive and bipartisan way. I am committed to doing that.
    But loading PAHPA up with this issue that has never been 
part of PAHPA reauthorization is the wrong way to go. Because 
if we open up PAHPA, there is a whole lot of other important 
issues that Members of Congress would like to include, 
including bans to gain-of-function research, including dealing 
with the politicization at CDC that happened during the 
pandemic, including discussing mask mandates and other 
mandates. These are all important issues that a lot of my 
colleagues want to discuss and would love to include in PAHPA. 
But this is not the proper place. PAHPA is too important. We 
have to stay narrowly focused on reauthorization to get this 
thing through the House.
    And it is going to be tough. This is not going to be an 
easy path. These are not easy issues. But if we stick together 
and we do this in a bipartisan way, we can do this, and we owe 
it to our constituents to do that. And so I just ask Ranking 
Member Eshoo and my colleagues on the other side, please work 
with us. Please keep the process moving. We will work together 
on drug shortages and a whole lot of other issues this year, 
and I believe this committee has a long track record of getting 
things done. I think we can do both things, and I think we 
will.
    You know, I have worked very hard to solicit feedback from 
the private sector, from Federal, State, and local partners, 
constituents on the necessary changes that we need in this 
reauthorization language as we look at the entire preparedness 
enterprise. And I have emphasized in the past that involving 
the private sector is almost always the best way to get things 
done. Private-public partnerships flourished in North Carolina 
during COVID, and to me it is--the best way to replicate these 
is to continue to strengthen these kind of partnerships. In the 
dozens of RFI responses, public-private partnerships are 
mentioned with the goal of enhancing them and improving the 
transparency for the administration for these relationships.
    One of my bills noticed for this hearing would establish a 
PHEMCE advisory committee to receive input from industry and 
improve communications and transparency from PHEMCE to private 
industry. I would welcome a Democrat that would like to 
cosponsor this with us to make sure this is bipartisan going 
forward. I think there has been a lot of support expressed 
today for it.
    Another issue that I think is really important is 
cybersecurity in our health systems. This is a bigger problem 
that surpasses PAHPA, but as it relates to our Nation's 
preparedness I think it is something we can build out.
    I have used up a lot of my time, but Dr. Parker, are there 
any specific actions we should look towards to address 
cybersecurity as it relates to our health preparedness?
    Dr. Parker. Sure. I mean, you--I will simply just say we 
have got to hard-wire cybersecurity security protection into 
our information systems as we think about health security 
preparedness. That is the simplest way to say it.
    Mr. Hudson. Well, I think it is well said, and I appreciate 
that, and we do have--we do address that in this PAHPA 
reauthorization, and we will--that is something we are going to 
have to continue to work together on to--I like what you say, 
we have got to hard-wire it into the process.
    So with that Mr. Chair, I will yield back.
    Mr. Burgess. The gentleman yields back. The Chair thanks 
the gentleman. The Chair now recognizes Dr. Schrier for 5 
minutes for questions.
    Ms. Schrier. Thank you, Dr. Burgess, and thank you very 
much to the witnesses for being here today.
    Many of my colleagues have already highlighted lessons 
learned from the pandemic and how that should really inform our 
reauthorization of the preparedness programs.
    One lesson that we learned is we can't take our healthcare 
workforce for granted, and our providers on the front lines 
have been highly impacted by this pandemic, leading to burnout, 
resignations, early retirements. And we don't ever want to find 
ourselves unprepared to rise to the needs of our patients in 
the next disaster or the next catastrophe. That is why I was 
proud to introduce the Doctors at the Ready Act with 
Representative Johnson, which you just heard about, to prevent 
lags in hiring medical providers that could render the country 
underresourced at a time of need.
    And this bipartisan legislation will allow ASPR, the 
Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, to directly 
hire healthcare professionals into the National Disaster 
Medical System. This means talent can be retained and they can 
move through the process with a faster timeline, and there will 
be more providers when we need them.
    Dr. Parker, you already answered the questions that I had 
in how important this is, so I just want to thank you for your 
responses, and I will move on to another topic, which is 
testing. This was another important lesson learned in the 
pandemic.
    For years, many of the colleagues in this room have heard 
me talk about the importance of rapid testing, and I could not 
wait to get this rolled out and into the hands of people as 
quickly as possible. There was a lot of frustration there.
    But we also remember how frustrating it was right at the 
start of the pandemic, when the U.S. was doing fewer than 100 
tests a day, everything had to get shipped to the CDC, and 
meanwhile, in Korea, they had drive-through testing sites and 
were doing 10,000 tests per day, which was key to containing 
the disease.
    And so, you know, at each stage it seemed like there were 
all kinds of barriers--running out of reagent, not having the 
right supplies--and barriers that, with the right panel of 
public health and industry advisors, could have been resolved 
quickly. So I wanted to just highlight the bipartisan 
Diagnostic Testing Preparedness Plan Act with Representatives 
Pence, Carson, and Bucshon. It directs HHS and related agencies 
to develop a plan for rapid development and scaling up of 
testing in a public health emergency.
    Dr. Washington, as a public health director, can you talk 
about having--how having rapid access to labs, rapid tests 
ready to go would help with future disaster response?
    Dr. Washington. I mean, it is absolutely critical. As you 
have already outlined, testing at the beginning of COVID 
pandemic was almost virtually impossible. And so we struggled. 
And again, it is one of those things where you are kind of 
flying blind. If you don't have information about who has a 
condition of any kind, you can't contact trace, you can't 
isolate individuals, and you can't do what we need to do to be 
able to disrupt transmission. And so it is absolutely vital.
    And it is important to be able to activate it quickly, as 
you have already described. And I think having mechanisms in 
place with both public and private laboratories is really 
essential.
    And the last piece I will say before I am quiet about this 
is the workforce. Beyond the laboratory workforce, it is 
absolutely essential to have the workforce in the community 
that can actually do the testing, which was a huge challenge 
for us during the pandemic, because we didn't have folks who 
could do swabbing, and we had to extend capacity for different 
types, different levels of medical providers to do that. And I 
think all those things are really essential for us to prepare 
for now.
    Ms. Schrier. Amen. Thank you.
    The last issue--I have just a bit over a minute--we have 
recently been--have had highlighted for us the shortage of 
oncology drugs. And cancer drug shortages are at an all-time 
high. There are many causes. The Seattle Times earlier this 
month ran an article citing that hospitals across Washington 
State and the country are seeing these shortages, and the 
changes that they are having to make, like, to reduce people's 
dosing, which could compromise their care. This is happening at 
Seattle Children's Hospital, it is happening at other 
hospitals.
    And as a provider, this is alarming as, potentially, a 
patient one day--I hope not, but that is incredibly alarming, 
and we need these treatments to be available.
    Dr. Gralow, it is wonderful to see you again in this 
capacity. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about 
how the Federal Government can help in response to these cancer 
drug and other drug--we could even go to ADHD medications, 
these shortages. Thank you.
    Dr. Gralow. Well, we in the oncology community do believe 
we are in the midst of a severe health crisis. Right now it is 
cancer drugs. Previously, it has been asthma drugs and diabetes 
drugs. It could be infectious disease drugs tomorrow. The kinds 
of things that we are asking for relate to drugs to treat every 
kind of disease. It is just cancer right now.
    We are asking--not a lot more regulation, but a little more 
regulation. There are a few legislative fixes.
    We agree that this is a market failure, first and foremost, 
and we need to work together to get high-quality manufacturers 
in the United States. We need to figure out the incentives. So 
it is a mix of legislative, regulatory, market issues that are 
going to solve this problem, not just for cancer but for every 
disease.
    Ms. Schrier. Thank you.
    Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Burgess. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair thanks 
the gentlelady. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia, Mr. Carter, for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank all of you 
for being here. This is extremely important.
    You know, I like to say that there is a difference in 
knowing something and realizing something. We have known for 
many years that we are too dependent on other countries, 
particularly adversarial countries, for our PPE, for our drugs 
and medical needs. But we realized it during the pandemic, when 
it became real.
    In fact, as a member of the Doctors Caucus, I was disturbed 
to learn--and I learned about it during a time that we were 
talking with the ASPR at that time, and he told us that, even 
though we didn't know about the virus until about February of 
2020, they saw a downtick in the amount of PPE and drugs that 
were coming from China as far back as the fall of 2019. That 
shows us that they were hoarding that, and they were going to 
use it for their own selves and not send it to us. That should 
be a lesson that we should learn and not to let happen again.
    And as we know, each State has certain needs. Some States 
may have needed ventilators, some States may have needed PPE. 
Every State is different, and that is why I have introduced the 
State stockpile bill. Obviously, we need a robust Federal 
stockpile, and this is not to replace that, and instead this is 
to supplement it. And certain parts of that were passed last 
year. But I have still got another bill this year that--H.R. 
3631, the State Strategic Stockpile Act, and it is being 
considered today, and it would extend the matching program 
through the--what was approved last year was a 2-year program, 
but this would extend it through 2028, and it would coincide 
with the timeframe of PAHPA reauthorization.
    Dr. Parker, I want to ask you, would you agree that States 
need to be better prepared for the next public health 
emergency, in terms of having access to critical medical 
countermeasures such as diagnostics, PPE, treatments, et 
cetera?
    Dr. Parker. Well, some States are doing it already. My 
State is taking those kind of actions. So I think, one, we 
absolutely need to make sure and bolster the Strategic National 
Stockpile that is managed by ASPR, no doubt about that, and 
improve that.
    But, you know, I think if a State feels that they need to 
also have--to not be completely dependent upon the SNS, that 
they need to take the actions that they need to do.
    And I just remember during the H5N1 pandemic exercise 
preparedness in 2006 to 2009, one of the policy activities that 
Secretary Leavitt at the time was stockpiling antivirals was--
the concept was skin in the game.
    Mr. Carter. Absolutely.
    Dr. Parker. So the Federal Government, you know, paid three 
quarters of the stockpile, and the States paid 25 percent. So 
there was this policy of skin in the game for the stockpile of 
antivirals.
    Mr. Carter. Right.
    Dr. Parker. That was something you can go back and look at 
history.
    Mr. Carter. Well, again, my bill, parts of it were adopted 
last year in a 2-year extension, so this will just be another 
extension to get us through 2028.
    Ms. Arthur, I wanted to ask you, what are--what do you 
think the benefits are of States having the ability to 
stockpile products like this?
    Ms. Arthur. Well, thank you, Mr. Carter. Actually, this is 
an important opportunity for States.
    All the States don't have the same necessary risks and 
exposures. So there are States that actually could be exposed 
to very different emerging infectious diseases that come to 
their region from areas that are close to them. This would 
allow those States to, for example, stockpile certain vaccines 
or antivirals specific to their needs for their population, 
where they may face different epidemiological risks than in 
other States.
    Mr. Carter. Good, thank you for that. Now, very quickly, I 
want to turn my attention to drug shortages.
    And Mr. Okon, I wanted to ask you, can you talk about the 
recently passed so-called Inflation Reduction Act, and how it 
could impact drug shortages further?
    Mr. Okon. So the idea, Mr. Carter, of having a rebate on 
the inflation side of a brand-name drug and a very expensive 
brand-name drug, fine, that makes sense. We supported that. But 
the idea of a low-cost generic, where a generic manufacturer 
now is going to have no price control at all, that is a bad 
thing.
    And the problem here is we call a drug a drug. And as a 
Member of the Congress who is a pharmacist, you understand it 
is very different in terms of these generic drugs, especially 
the injectable drugs, than these, you know, brand-name drugs. 
And I think we need to realize that, and we need to change our 
view here, because when you simply add and you price-control 
these manufacturers, they are handcuffed, they are not going to 
do anything.
    And let me just say one other fast thing. I will give you 
an early warning sign right now. I had a pharmacist from 
Dayton, Ohio, this morning--who is here, up on the Hill, 
talking about PBMs--talk to the largest generic drug 
manufacturer out there. And this manufacturer says, ``I am 
going to give you the list of the drugs that we are going to 
stop making,'' and those are cancer drugs. So this is a crisis. 
It is absolutely a crisis.
    Mr. Carter. OK.
    Mr. Okon. We have to realize these are low-cost products 
that we are making literally not profitable at all.
    Mr. Carter. Absolutely. Well, thank you, and thank all of 
you again. This is extremely important, and we appreciate you 
being here.
    And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Burgess. The gentleman yields back. The Chair thanks 
the gentleman, and the Chair recognizes the gentlelady from 
Massachusetts for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mrs. Trahan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    As a cofounder and cochair of the bipartisan Pandemic 
Preparedness Caucus, I have taken every opportunity in hearings 
like this one to highlight the unique opportunity that we have 
before us to take the lessons learned through the COVID-19 
pandemic and apply them in a way that better prepares our 
healthcare system to respond to future unknown threats to our 
public health. So I am glad to see that the committee noticed 
some bipartisan policies for this hearing today, including my 
bill, the Disease X Act.
    But I am disappointed that the majority has decided to move 
forward with flat funding for the preparedness programs that 
sit within PAHPA as well as exclude numerous FDA supply chain 
policies.
    Mr. Chairman, I am concerned with static funding that falls 
well short of what frontline health workers, public health 
experts, and infectious disease specialists have said is 
necessary to prevent another COVID-level pandemic.
    How many times did the predicted death toll change over the 
course of the pandemic? First it was 50-to-60,000 deaths, then 
it was 100,000. Every month the projection went higher while we 
heard countless cases of nurses and doctors reusing masks and 
wearing trash bags to protect themselves as States raced 
against each other and the Federal Government for shipments of 
PPE, as hospitals begged ventilator companies for just one more 
machine to help keep patients alive.
    Now, 3\1/2\ years later, after the first COVID case was 
discovered in the United States, more than 1 million Americans 
have tragically lost their lives to the virus. We can and we 
should be looking for ways to do better, moving forward, to 
ensure that we are never caught flat-footed again.
    I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
who recognize the importance and the urgency in achieving that 
goal. Last week I introduced the Disease X Act alongside Dr. 
Burgess, Congressman Crenshaw, and Congresswoman Lee to 
establish a Disease X medical countermeasures program at BARDA 
for unknown viral threats with pandemic potential.
    Current funding constraints at BARDA only allow the agency 
to go so far. With much of BARDA's MCM development work focused 
on a defined list of chemicals, biological, radiological, and 
nuclear threat agents, as well as influenza, we may not be 
prepared to develop and manufacture at scale future drugs and 
vaccines against unknown viral threats that can lead to 
devastating pandemics. The Disease X Act will help BARDA to 
fully focus on their full list of priorities, including an 
increased emphasis on emerging infectious diseases with 
pandemic potential.
    Ms. Arthur, BIO supported the introduction of the 
bipartisan Disease X Act, and I am hoping you can explain the 
importance of this bill, given the difference in the threat 
landscape now compared with the last PAHPA reauthorization.
    Ms. Arthur. Well, thank you, Congresswoman Trahan, for 
introducing that bill.
    This is actually an opportunity to do activities in R&D and 
manufacturing scale-up during the interpandemic period that 
could make us better prepared in the future. We actually 
learned this lesson, even if you look at our response to 
monkeypox. The great investments made by the partnership 
between industry and BARDA and the NIH to make the smallpox 
antivirals and the smallpox vaccines actually allowed us, 
because of that viral family, to have the products for Mpox 
that we needed.
    So taking that same approach here, we would actually work 
on platform technologies, monoclonal antibodies, and mechanisms 
for new oral antivirals, and put those to work against a host 
of known pandemic threats. And then those particular products 
might result in products for known threats but actually would 
allow us to respond maybe within 100 days to an unknown threat.
    Mrs. Trahan. And just continuing on with the proposed 
Disease X program at BARDA, how important do you think it will 
be to have dedicated funding authorized for this program, 
rather than just pulling funding from BARDA's general medical 
countermeasures pot?
    Ms. Arthur. We think it is actually very important that 
this have its own dedicated funding line. If that is not 
possible, although I think that is the right approach, really 
scaling up BARDA's overall number to more like what is in the 
PHEMCE multiyear budget, 1.5 to $1.6 billion, would give them 
the flexibility to work on what we know is already part of 
their strategy, which is to do platform-agnostic work around 
viral families. So a separate line item would be optimal, but 
scaling up the budget would also be important.
    Mrs. Trahan. Thank you, Ms. Arthur.
    Everyone here today represents a family who lost a loved 
one to COVID-19. And each of us represents a small business 
owner who was forced to close their doors, some for good, 
because of the emergency. We represent children who lost out on 
a valuable in-person learning so that they could keep 
themselves and their families safe when we knew next to nothing 
about the virus. So as members of this committee, we have an 
obligation to take lessons learned from the past 3 years and 
make investments now to prevent another catastrophic pandemic. 
And the Disease Act will help us get there.
    So I look forward to working with members of the committee 
to pass this legislation with the funding it requires. Thank 
you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Burgess. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair thanks 
the gentlelady. The Chair recognizes Dr. Joyce for 5 minutes 
for questions.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to our panel 
for appearing here today.
    It is disappointing that we are not meeting today to 
examine a bipartisan reauthorization of PAHPA. As our Nation 
emerges from one of the largest and worst global pandemics in 
recorded history, we need to be moving together on this.
    With that said, Mr. Okon, thank you for your testimony, 
because I believe it adds important context to the drugs and 
the issues that we are facing today. I have heard from health 
providers in my district in Pennsylvania from as large as the 
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is the largest 
healthcare provider in Pennsylvania, to small individual 
practices about the acute shortages of both carboplatin and 
cisplatin. This is a serious issue, as you alluded to 
previously in your testimony, with potential to cause delays in 
cares for patients, which are detrimental to outcomes when it 
comes to treating cancer.
    These shortages, they are not a new phenomenon, and they 
have been known to occur because of poor policy decisions that 
have hollowed out the generic manufacturing capacity right here 
in the United States.
    Mr. Okon, can you please elaborate on the impact of both 
the 340B drug pricing program and the IRA, and what they are 
having on the economics of generic manufacturing?
    And do you feel that Congress needs to address these 
matters holistically to avoid these shortfalls continuing?
    Mr. Okon. Dr. Joyce, let me state for the record, because I 
always get misquoted on this, the 340B drug discount program is 
an essential program to help communities and, basically, 
patients in need.
    Mr. Joyce. I concur with that.
    Mr. Okon. And I know you do. And the problem is, though, 
when you take discounts and rebates and you apply them to what 
is a very low-priced drug to begin with, in many cases these 
drugs are underwater.
    Likewise, on the Inflation Reduction Act, which I just told 
Mr. Carter--on the brand name, the inflation reduction piece of 
that on brand names, that may be a good policy. But the problem 
is on the generic side you take away the pricing power. So if 
you have a generic manufacturer that has to literally invest 
more in their facilities and do the things the FDA is telling 
them to do, you have taken away their pricing power because, 
again, we are talking about very low-cost drugs.
    So you don't want to constrain them. And in fact, the 
reimbursement system, the--literally, that provision of the 
Inflation Reduction Act and these mandatory discounts and 
rebates are pushing these products all overseas, and even 
overseas you have manufacturers that are stopping their 
capacity.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you. And I want to finally ask you to 
address the wholesale overhaul of generic drug manufacturing 
and reimbursement. And is that appropriately done in 
legislation that is supposedly narrowly targeted on emergency 
preparedness?
    Mr. Okon. We need comprehensive legislation to literally 
address the drug shortages. And if we don't, they are going to 
get worse, and Americans are going to die, even more than the 
half-million Americans that Dr. Gralow said.
    So we need to literally strip away the denial, we need to 
realize that, yes, there are warning signs, there are definite 
things that Dr. Gralow talked about that are important, but we 
need to address this root financial cause, and that should be 
in comprehensive legislation and should be a top priority of 
this committee.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Okon.
    The Pandemic All-Hazards Preparedness Act is not just about 
preparing for emerging infectious diseases but ensuring that 
our country is prepared to respond to a myriad of threats, 
including nuclear, chemical, and bioterrorism.
    According to the unclassified version of the Annual Threat 
Assessment of the U.S. intelligence community released by the 
Director of National Intelligence this year, the lack of 
preparedness and response in questions around COVID origins--
and I quote--``may inspire some adversaries to consider options 
related to the development of biologic weapons.'' This 
unclassified report specifically calls out China, Iran, North 
Korea, and Russia.
    Dr. Parker, given your background and work with both DoD 
and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious 
Diseases, how well-equipped are ASPR and BARDA to prepare for 
and respond to a myriad of threats, including biological 
weapons? And if not, what should be done?
    Dr. Parker. Well, first, we are much better prepared than 
we used to be going back, say, 20 years ago, before the 
administration and Congress began to provide new authorities 
and appropriations, things like Project BioShield and so forth. 
So we are better prepared than we were 20 years ago, but we 
still have a long way to go.
    I have been studying the biological threat, either the 
intentional, whether bioterrorism, biological warfare, for 
quite some time. And there is no doubt that, unfortunately, our 
experience with COVID probably has increased our risk to 
biological threat from an unnatural cause.
    And so we have to take--the work that you are doing in this 
committee is absolutely essential to help give ASPR, BARDA the 
additional tools and appropriations so we can be better 
prepared, because we will be surprised.
    Mr. Joyce. My time has expired, but I would like to agree 
with you that those additional tools need to come through this 
committee.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I yield.
    Mr. Burgess. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair 
thanks the gentleman. The Chair now recognizes Dr. Ruiz for 5 
minutes for questions, please.
    Mr. Ruiz. Thank you.
    As an emergency medicine physician trained in humanitarian 
disaster aid, I have seen firsthand how critical preparedness 
is to mobilizing an effective emergency response. And as we 
have talked about numerous times in this committee, COVID has 
taught us numerous lessons about how to better be prepared for 
the next public health emergency.
    Leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, funding for public 
health programs had declined significantly over time. We saw 
the consequences of that underinvestment when the pandemic hit 
and public health departments across the country did not have 
the staff or resources to respond.
    Now, I am not suggesting that we need the same level of 
funding on an annual basis than we do in the throes of a 
pandemic. I do, however, feel that it is important to our 
conversation here today that--discuss the implication of years 
of underfunding that landed us in a place where we were not as 
prepared as we could and should have been. We would be foolish 
not to course correct now.
    And if now, on the heels of the largest pandemic in 100 
years, during which over a million Americans have lost their 
lives and countless others continue to suffer from long COVID, 
if we can't make smart, robust investments into our public 
health systems, did we really learn our lesson at all?
    So I urge the majority, as we move forward in this 
reauthorization process, to help ensure that history doesn't 
repeat itself and that the next time we have a robust--that we 
have a robust, well-funded system to meet challenges as they 
arrive.
    Of course, I am not suggesting that we simply throw money 
at the problem. Our investments must be smart and strategic, 
and investment goes beyond funding. It is also about investing 
in smart policies that make our public health systems more 
efficient and effective. Included in that bucket is addressing 
our policies surrounding data sharing, both from State and 
local health systems to the Federal Government and the other 
way around.
    Science is guided by data, and public health decisions are 
guided by science. Guidelines and recommendations and next-step 
decisions are more effective when they use scientific data to 
inform them. And we saw how barriers to data sharing really 
hurt our public health officials throughout all levels, from 
the head of the CDC to the local health departments.
    Dr. Washington, in your written testimony you talk about 
the importance of giving CDC the authority to collect and 
coordinate public health data necessary to serve its mission, 
and state that, ``The current framework for collecting and 
sharing public health data has resulted in fragmented and 
inconsistent reporting to CDC and to State and local 
partners.'' Can you tell us how the Data and Public Health Act 
under consideration today would address those problems?
    Dr. Washington. Certainly. So I will say--and I agree with 
a lot of what you just said, and I appreciate the comments. We 
must have an ability to collect information, and we have to 
have the ability to collect it in a timely fashion. And having 
the authority to collect that information without having to 
negotiate agreements with every single institution, every 
single State, every single local jurisdiction to be able to 
share information is a huge administrative and highly 
inefficient way for us to be able to achieve our goals and to 
actually have a system where data flows freely between those 
institutions.
    I am not saying it should just flow. It, obviously, should 
be as needed. But we have got to have the connectivity, we have 
got to have the authority that allows us to then move as 
quickly as possible.
    When COVID happened, we had to authorize that data about 
COVID could be collected. It was not a known condition, and so 
it wasn't reportable. So we had to go through the regulatory 
process to make it reportable, which takes time.
    Mr. Ruiz. You know, we often talk about the importance of 
the CDC being able to collect data from State and local health 
officials. But often lost in that discussion is the importance 
of two-way data sharing, not simply CDC collecting the data but 
also being able to share data to the folks on the ground.
    Dr. Washington, can you tell us how this kind of data 
sharing for you at the city level can help public health 
officials navigate through the various stages of a public 
health emergency like COVID or Mpox?
    Dr. Washington. It is absolutely essential. So I will take 
Mpox as an example.
    So CDC allocates--allocated vaccines to jurisdictions based 
on the disease burden in their communities. If the data that 
they are making those decisions on is not real-time and up to 
date--for example, we had a couple of cases, but within a 
matter of a few weeks that went from a couple of cases to 
almost 100. And so the decision--and we didn't get enough 
vaccine to be able to respond on the ground, because they were 
using data that was out of date. And so it is really important 
for us to have access----
    Mr. Ruiz. One last question. You know, I spoke about the 
importance of adequate investment in public health and updating 
our public health data system. What barriers did you face that 
would be addressed simply by investing in new data system 
technologies?
    Dr. Washington. So the reporting to the public, for one, 
was a great example where people were not receiving 
information. We had three different numbers from local, State, 
and Federal partners in terms of what the disease burden was. 
And that is why we have to have that chain that flows up and 
down between us all at the same time.
    Mr. Ruiz. Thank you.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Burgess. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The gentleman 
yields back. The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady from 
Tennessee, Mrs. Harshbarger, for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mrs. Harshbarger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all 
for being here because I got a lot of questions, but I will 
have to submit a lot for the record.
    I want to start by talking about emerging infectious 
diseases, and the primary purpose and mission of ASPR is to 
ensure our Nation in preparing for all hazards, including those 
posed by deliberate chemical, biological, nuclear, and 
radiological, or CBRN, threats. And, you know, the escalating 
actions by Russia--you know, invading Ukraine--and threats of 
chemical warfare are--you know, that is on everybody's mind. 
And I have been a compounding pharmacists for 36 years, and I 
remember after 9/11 I had people lining up at my door for 
iodine tablets because they were afraid of nuclear fallout.
    So I guess my question is, what are your thoughts on how 
BARDA should best be engaging with the private-sector partners 
to prioritize America's stockpile of critical CBRN vaccines, 
treatments, PPE, and ensuring they are well-maintained, and 
also to ensure there is no disruption in the availability of 
these supplies?
    And I guess I could ask you, Dr. Parker, and then I will go 
to you, Ms. Arthur.
    Dr. Parker. Sure, and BARDA has focused on the CBRN threat 
for quite some time. In fact, I recall my time in ASPR even 
before it was ASPR--it was called OPHEP--but we were very 
concerned about the nuclear threat.
    Mrs. Harshbarger. Yes.
    Dr. Parker. And the radiation threat. And actually, some of 
the acquisition programs started back then for stockpiling some 
drugs that are now in the SNS for the nuclear threat.
    And I think, you know, the current day--we cannot discount 
the nuclear threat, weapons of mass destruction, and chem and 
bio. So we cannot be complacent about that. BARDA has programs 
to interface with the private sector and those kind of 
programs, and Project BioShield was originally enacted very 
specifically for the biological threat, but all weapons of mass 
destruction.
    So we just need to--we need to keep emphasizing those 
programs, and emphasizing that is a problem. And States and 
locals also have to exercise because it is a huge, huge problem 
when you think about what happens if there is a nuclear 
detonation in one of our communities. It is huge. And I have 
been in several national exercises, and it is--we not--we 
should not be complacent.
    Mrs. Harshbarger. No, we can't be complacent.
    Ms. Arthur?
    Ms. Arthur. No, of course, I agree with Dr. Parker. Thanks 
for that question.
    I think industry actually really wants to bring some novel 
technologies to bear in this space. They are working on 
products that could help, like wearables, to help notice that 
you have been exposed to chemical agents or nerve agents, 
working both with the DoD and BARDA together. And I think this 
is a place, in particular, where DoD, in partnership with 
industry, actually could give us products that could help us, 
the warfighter as well as national security defense.
    Mrs. Harshbarger. Yes, I have talked to some innovative 
companies that work on oral medications too, to help with some 
of that.
    Mr. Okon, you know, I have talked to you many, many times.
    And Dr. Gralow, listen, we know the FDA. Even the drug 
shortage list is not comprehensive. They don't keep a 
comprehensive list. I have compounded sterile products for many 
years. At any given time there's 300 drug shortages on a list, 
OK?
    We need to reform some of the things with the FDA, and 
especially with, you know, the--just like you said, Ted, it is 
about the reimbursement. Nobody is going to make a product if 
they lose money. That is just not going to happen. And we need 
to reform that and, you know, get an updated list. There's 
many, many things we can work on--340B programs, things like 
that.
    You know, one of the things--Ms. Arthur, I have the only 
plant in the country, a penicillin-producing plant in the 
country, and I had to go through the designation of getting 
that designated as critical infrastructure. That is another 
thing we may look at doing for different facilities--antibiotic 
resistance, like Representative Barragan was talking about. 
There is--and I talked to someone in the Biden administration 
about having 20 antibiotics on a list that we have to have for 
330 million Americans.
    There is a lot of things we need to do, Ted. And I just 
read an article--and it was dated June 2nd--that the FDA is 
going to allow an unapproved cisplatin to be used in this 
country. They haven't even been inspected since 2019 in that 
facility. That is what we are coming up to. And we have 503(b) 
facilities, compounding facilities that are FDA registered, 
that can fill that gap. But the price is going to be enormous.
    We can be on the front lines as compounding pharmacists 
and, you know, take care of those patients, but they have to 
allow us to do that, and some of the reduced regulations. So I 
will talk to you all about that later. There is a lot we have 
to think about.
    And thank you all for your time. And with that, I will 
yield back.
    Mr. Guthrie [presiding]. The gentlelady yields back. The 
Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Pence, for 
5 minutes for questions.
    Mr. Pence. Thank you, Chairman Guthrie and everyone 
appearing here today.
    I am proud to lead the Diagnostic Testing Preparedness Plan 
Act with my colleagues Congressman Bucshon, Congressman Carson, 
and Congresswoman Schrier.
    Diagnostic testing capabilities are crucial for the 
successful disease outbreak containment during a public health 
emergency. Our country relies on diagnostic testing as a 
critical component of our medical countermeasures response 
strategy. Innovators in the Hoosier State such as Roche 
Diagnostics have been leading the charge to ensure the Nation 
has safe and reliable diagnostics.
    It is important for HHS have a blueprint that would 
facilitate the innovation and development of diagnostics during 
a PHE. This bill would direct HHS to develop a plan describing 
the process of rapid development, approval, scaling, 
procurement, and distribution of diagnostics.
    In addition, my legislation would ensure HHS is prepared to 
communicate and collaborate with the private and public sectors 
to ensure diagnostics are readily available.
    I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Energy 
and Commerce Committee to get this legislation across the 
finish line.
    Dr. Parker, based on your time as Principal Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, can you 
explain the importance of ASPR coordinating with the private 
sector to meet the demand for diagnostic testing during public 
health emergencies?
    Dr. Parker. Yes, absolutely, and it is absolutely essential 
that we have these, and we have talked about this a lot today, 
about the importance of the private sector and the importance 
of public-private partnerships. And I think ASPR and BARDA over 
the years have done a lot to improve their ability to interact 
with the private sector, but we can always do better.
    And this is a--the diagnostics is one that is--they are all 
important, but this is certainly essential, because this really 
guides a lot of our decision making early in a pandemic, early 
in an outbreak, and to rapidly surge and to make sure that we 
have distributed diagnostics and point-of-need diagnostics and 
home diagnostics is essential.
    So the plan is well-warranted. I support the initiative, 
and we just do everything we can to improve those public-
private partnerships, make them functional.
    Mr. Pence. OK, thank you.
    Ms. Arthur, I heard you state earlier the--that you think 
increased coordination and collaboration with the private 
sector would improve the country's response during future 
public health emergencies. How would the United States benefit 
from a preapproved diagnostic testing preparedness plan?
    Ms. Arthur. Thank you for that question. It is actually 
really important to have a plan. It actually guides industry in 
what can be developed and actually allows industry to work on 
some of those things during peacetime. And I think this is one 
of the advantages.
    Now that we have had innovation in diagnostics and tests 
and tooling, including home tests, which we never had before, 
that actually can springboard into even more investment in 
actually technologies like that. So having that public-private 
partnership where the Government sets out what they are trying 
to achieve in a pandemic allows industry to work towards that 
goal in partnership with them.
    Mr. Pence. OK, thank you.
    And with that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Guthrie. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes Dr. Dunn for 5 minutes for the purpose of questions.
    Mr. Dunn. Sorry, I didn't know I was next.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Dunn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the 
opportunity to analyze the legislation that may accompany the 
reauthorization of the Pandemic Preparedness Act. The 
expiration of this important bill comes at a time when we have 
learned many valuable lessons about enduring a pandemic, and 
now we have an opportunity to put those lessons into practice.
    It is important to ensure the Strategic National Stockpile, 
BARDA, Project BioShield, other programs designed to assist in 
Federal response, that they are all retuned for a more timely, 
coordinated, and successful response next time, because, 
unfortunately, there will be a next time.
    I appreciate the transparency measures put forth by Chair 
Rodgers, which will ensure that the CDC guidance has integrity 
and does not jeopardize the well-being of American citizens. We 
have learned of undue influences over the agency during the 
COVID-19 pandemic and the grave dangers and damage associated 
with extended lockdowns. We must never allow a Federal agency 
to issue such sweeping, binding, and inaccurate guidance in an 
emergency again.
    Other important measures included in the discussion drafts 
before us today will ensure proper congressional oversight and 
shed light on the decision making of health agency bureaucrats. 
I appreciate my colleague, Congresswoman Dingell, for working 
with me on the Ensuring Sufficient Supply of Testing Act, which 
will ensure that key diagnostic testing supplies and equipment 
needed to develop and run testing at scale are available and 
accessible to clinical laboratories in times of emergency.
    This bill will ensure that clinical laboratories will be 
able to enter the Strategic National Stockpile contracts.
    It is also critically important that the Strategic National 
Stockpile include test kits, reagents, precision plastics, and 
other tools that labs rely on to rapidly scale their responses. 
Labs played a critical role in response to the SARS-CoV-2 
pandemic. In the early days of the spread of COVID-19, testing 
was one of the few tools at our disposal to understand the 
nature of the pathogen.
    Testing is also an important aspect of surveillance, which 
is an area where improvement and increased coordination is 
greatly needed. I would also like to thank my colleagues 
Representative Crenshaw and Peters for putting on a discussion 
draft on this very topic, the Bio Early Warning Plan.
    We need better coordination between public health agencies 
and the intelligence community. We may have avoided the entire 
pandemic had the intel community had more visibility into the 
grants that NIH was funding. A more coordinated effort is 
needed for a whole-of-government defense and response to future 
pandemics.
    Dr. Washington, you have discussed at length today the 
problems that your department had accessing testing early in 
the pandemic. I hope that the bills that you--have been 
proposed by myself, Representative Dingell, Representative 
Pence, and others, I hope that these bills will prevent that in 
your--happening to you in the future. I certainly feel your 
pain.
    Dr. Parker, it is always good to see you, a fellow USAMRIID 
staffer from the old days. I appreciate your written testimony 
in some detail. I have read that and reviewed it. Thank you for 
that input. Your emphasis on the national security 
considerations and the need for coordination between DoD and 
health agencies is very well outlined. And you also outlined 
many gaps in the coordination and made some smart 
recommendations that can truly help us be prepared for the next 
pandemic.
    Let me ask you, what would your recommendations be to 
encourage more coordination before--before--a pandemic breaks 
out? Clearly, we had a blind spot when it came to the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology.
    Dr. Parker. Well, I mean, that is the issue, I think, 
across the whole preparedness enterprise, whatever component we 
are thinking about, is how do we make progress during the 
intercrisis period, if it is all hazards or emerging infectious 
diseases. That is where we have been challenged over the years. 
We cannot sustain our efforts after a crisis is over, and so 
that--we have to figure that out. We just really have to figure 
that out, taking actions during the--between crises.
    Now, there is--the health community and the intelligence 
community and the law enforcement community, we absolutely have 
to figure out how to better coordinate. Now, there has been 
coordination over the years. I know my career, I--that is why I 
call myself--I have worked in health security, because I 
spanned those--that gap pretty well during my career. But we 
have to span that gap.
    And I would say that some of our science agencies, our 
health agencies, we need to make sure that some of the leaders 
actually are pretty aware of some of the more detailed 
information that may be in the DNI's annual threat assessments 
that is on the classified side. So I think our health agencies 
need to be more aware of some of the security concerns and need 
to be more security aware and have more of a security culture.
    Mr. Dunn. Well, we are both familiar with some routine 
surveillance technologies that were in place, even back when I 
was at USAMRIID. So thank you very much for your information, 
your insights.
    I thank all the panel for your comments today, a terrific 
panel, really outstanding.
    Mr. Chair, I yield back.
    Mr. Guthrie. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Crenshaw, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    I think every American should be concerned about the next 
pandemic because of how terribly our Government handled the 
last one. Not only did the Government lock down schools and 
businesses and mislead the public, but we were caught flat-
footed at the outset of the pandemic. We were unable to 
identify the threat we were facing and where that threat was 
coming from, and that had pretty severe consequences for the 
way we responded to COVID. And I think this committee should 
aim to fix that.
    Moving forward, the American Government must be able to 
quickly identify the source and severity of an emerging public 
health threat. That capability is required under law right now 
that we are still falling short of where we need to be. In 
fact, the Government Accountability Office found that ``more 
than 15 years after the law initially mandated it, the Federal 
Government does not yet have this needed situational awareness 
capability'' to identify and respond to these threats.
    Moreover, the Government Accountability Office says we need 
a ``lead operational division to address this deficiency in our 
response capabilities,'' and I will be filing this report for 
the record.
    So, you know, to sum it up, there is no one in charge, and 
that is a problem.
    For Dr. Parker, I have this question: Should the 
Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response create a 
strategy and implementation plan to aid our preparedness and 
attribute future threats?
    Dr. Parker. Well, yes, we absolutely need a strategy for 
attribution, and we need--an attribution is important, whether 
it is natural or unnatural. Kind of, the attribution kind of 
gets more in the unnatural. And I think about national command 
authority authorities. So whether ASPR, at the end of the day, 
is in charge of the unnatural attribution, I am not sure about 
that. But nonetheless, this committee could certainly require 
that HHS, DHS, DoD, DNI, DOE--who has actually some very good 
laboratory capabilities--develop a strategy for attribution.
    Mr. Crenshaw. Attribution and a kind of a single point of 
action and coordination as well, would you agree with that?
    Dr. Parker. I think that strategy would have to identify 
that. You would--you should identify that they need to develop 
a strategy, and develop then who will be in charge.
    Mr. Crenshaw. Right. Well, and for that reason I am working 
on legislation called the Bio Early Warning Act with 
Representative Peters from California.
    And our bill is really simple. It does create an 
operational strategy and supports private-sector technology 
that helps us identify every aspect of an emerging threat: 
where is it coming from, how serious is it, what should our 
response be. And we do this by, one, making sure the Department 
of Health and Human Services and the intelligence community are 
actually working together and sharing information rather than 
working in silos; two, creating a government strategy for 
attributing threats; and three, having the Administration for 
Strategic Preparedness and Response work with the private 
sector to create and deploy defenses that might be needed to 
respond to whatever threat we face. And this could be anything 
from advancements in genetic sequencing to diagnostic testing 
to wastewater surveillance.
    It should be clear--because there has been some 
misinformation put out by one three-letter agency--that this 
bill does not take away authority from the agencies that are 
currently doing this work. We just need a singular point of 
action and accountability to coordinate this work, and that is 
what the bill does. It is what GAO has called for.
    You know, we can't afford to have the same information 
failures we had with COVID, so we have to work to identify and 
respond to the dangerous threat landscape that is always 
evolving.
    And another way to think of this is a joint operating 
environment in the military. It is confusing. You had Army, 
Navy, Marines, Air Force there sometimes--not sure why----
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Crenshaw. But you always have a joint operating 
environment, and you have what is called combatant commands who 
is in charge of everyone in that operating environment working 
together. And you need--you absolutely need something along 
those lines when you are talking about a pandemic or a chemical 
attack or a biological attack.
    And of course, so I asked for my friend, Representative 
Richard--also known as the admiral from Texas, also known as 
Dan Crenshaw's biggest fan--Hudson, asked for his commitment to 
work with me to ensure that this is addressed in this year's 
PAHPA.
    And with that, I yield back.
    Mr. Guthrie. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the gentlelady from Iowa, Dr. Miller-Meeks, for 5 
minutes for questions.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I want to 
thank all the witnesses for testifying before the committee 
today. And----
    [Pause.]
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. The light's on.
    [Pause.]
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. This is a jerry-rigged system. No.
    [Laughter.]
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. From my time in the Army.
    I am a physician, a former director of a department of 
public health, and I know how--both how serious, how 
predictable another pandemic is--not when, but we know it will 
occur. And I also was, I think, the only Member of Congress, 
when we were passing the ARRP, or the second COVID bill in 
March of 2021, that spoke numerous times, both on the floor of 
Congress and in committee, about the necessity of funding the 
noncompetitive grants that go directly to local public 
healthcare agencies, not to the CDC, not to some other, you 
know, three-letter Government agency, but noncompetitive grants 
directly to local public healthcare.
    And I am glad to see that my bill, H.R. 3837, the Improving 
Public Health Preparedness Act, is included in the hearing. And 
I thank my colleagues, Congressman Buddy Carter and Congressman 
Balderson, for cosponsoring the bill.
    H.R. 3837 requires the HHS Secretary to delegate the 
maintenance and administration of the Strategic National 
Stockpile to the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and 
Response, which further enhances ASPR's authority over the SNS.
    SNS had a few homes since it was established in 1999--CDC, 
DHS, back to CDC, and then to ASPR in 2013--and operates most 
effectively under ASPR's jurisdiction, which is why their 
authority was expanded in 2018 under the last Pandemic and All-
Hazards Preparedness Act, or PAHPA. This legislation is a clean 
codification of SNS's current authority, which would bring 
welcomed stability and clarity.
    Furthermore, it seeks to demonstrate ASPR's leadership as 
the lead agency for our Nation's preparedness and response to 
public health security threats, as we just heard through the 
last question and response.
    Dr. Parker, in your written testimony you say the SNS along 
with other offices belong together under ASPR, and that they 
are each better served in this structure. Can you please 
explain why you believe this?
    Dr. Parker. Sure. I mean, I think it is very--and I am 
really happy to see this legislation. It makes a lot of sense 
to have BARDA, the Strategic National Stockpile, the industrial 
base supply management components of ASPR consolidated under 
the ASPR.
    And I think, you know, then how is the ASPR also going to 
manage and integrate--make sure that there is an integrated, 
seamless flow between the development of medical 
countermeasures, the acquisition, the procurement, the 
stockpiling, and also ensuring that the industrial supply 
chains are more resilient?
    So it makes--it is just logical that they are together. And 
it is also logical--we talked about in NDMS and the support of 
the healthcare system also--they are just logical that they are 
together.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Yes, I couldn't agree more. I had a bill 
in the last term on medical countermeasures that went through 
Homeland Security, as I was a member of Homeland Security. So 
having this--efforts that are helping to coordinate 
coordinated, I think, would be beneficial.
    Ms. Arthur, in your testimony you state that the SNS needs 
adequate resources to allow ASPR to manage the full lifecycle 
of all medical countermeasures developed under BARDA. Using 
existing funding and resources, do you believe that SNS is most 
equipped to manage medical countermeasures while under ASPR's 
authority?
    And what changes in SNS's structure would Congress consider 
to ensure we are stockpiling the most modern and effective 
MCMs?
    Ms. Arthur. Thank you so much for the question.
    I agree with Dr. Parker. This is an extremely important 
aspect of the role of ASPR. They actually work closely with 
their industry partners to manage the lifecycle of particularly 
those medical countermeasures that are going to be stockpiled 
in the SNS. And so having that end-to-end view of how those 
products will be used, how they are stockpiled, sharing the 
requirements, doing replenishment is a core role of ASPR. And 
anything that can strengthen their ability to share those 
requirements with their industry partners and do active 
replenishment with the right funding for the SNS will be a 
support for pandemic preparedness.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Thank you.
    I yield back and thank you, Chair, for this important 
hearing.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. The gentlelady yields back. The 
Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Indiana, Dr. Bucshon, 
for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Bucshon. Thank you very much, a lot going on today. 
Thank you for being here, I appreciate it. And thanks, 
Chairman, and again, thanks for all the witnesses being here.
    I think it--you know, as we go through today's hearing 
and--we keep our focus on the topic of preparedness and 
understand that the types of threats that we are preparing for 
are the types that we hope we never actually have to respond 
to.
    However, having just lived through the worst global 
pandemic in over a century, we have all seen just how important 
it is that we not only get this bill right but that we keep it 
tightly focused on the real threats we face and need to prepare 
for. Ultimately, I believe that, here, that less is more. The 
less we turn our preparedness efforts into the usual 
Washington, DC--what we call the Christmas tree of policies 
that result in the Government doing a bunch of things, and some 
of which we won't do well.
    So first, Ms. Arthur, BARDA has historically been very 
successful partnering with industry on medical countermeasures, 
leading to 77 FDA approvals. During the COVID-19 pandemic we 
saw how--just how critical innovation was to saving lives and 
getting us back to normal.
    And some of this you may have already answered, I 
apologize, but how would changes to BARDA and the SNS, or the 
Strategic National Stockpile, contracts to include reasonable 
pricing, or IP, march-in provisions impact how private sector 
industry works with ASPR, BARDA, and the SNS in the future?
    Ms. Arthur. Thank you very much for this question. It is 
very important.
    So policies on reasonable pricing and march-in rights have 
actually been tried in other programs, other public and private 
programs, and they have actually had a huge dampening effect on 
innovation, very negative effect.
    In the medical countermeasures space, this could actually 
be even worse, because these are products that already have a 
high risk to their development and, in general, have a limited 
marketplace that--and a major buyer, which is the U.S. 
Government. So if suddenly companies that wanted to bring their 
novel technologies to bear on an unmet medical need identified 
for the Government for national security purposes faced IP risk 
or challenges to their pricing for products that generally did 
not have a guaranteed commercial market, you would see 
companies have a very hard time deciding to work on these key 
products.
    Mr. Bucshon. Yes, it would stifle innovation and that type 
of thing. Thank you for that.
    And Mr. Okon, the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that--the 
critical need to have the supply chain and manufacturing 
capacity in place to be able to quickly respond to a future 
threat. I think we all know that. Unfortunately, the supply 
chain and the manufacturing capacity challenges were 
longstanding prior to COVID-19. We all know that. And while a 
lot of the focus will be spent on incentives in this space, I 
think we also need to look at how existing Federal policies can 
negatively impact the supply chain and manufacturing capacity.
    You mentioned 340B drug discounts are contributing to 
cancer drug shortages. Can you walk me through why this is the 
case?
    Mr. Okon. You know, I said for--and I will repeat it again, 
because it is on the record, Dr. Bucshon, as I know you do, 
believe that the 340B is a valuable program. And the problem 
is, when you take a low-cost drug to begin with, and you demand 
other rebates and discounts like 340B discounts on top of it, 
you are going to produce a product that, in many cases, has a 
negative return for these generic manufacturers. It is not 
worth them producing it.
    And I think it was Dr. Gralow actually said this is a U.S. 
problem, what we are seeing. The problem is nowhere in the 
world do you see the discounts and the rebates that we end up 
having here. And we have to realize that 340B Medicaid 
rebates--valuable, I mean, valuable programs, but pushed down 
these very low-cost products to such a level that they are 
simply unprofitable to make.
    Mr. Bucshon. Yes, I mean, I understand that. As I think 
most of the people know in Washington, I am working on a level 
of transparency in the 340B program that just lets us all know, 
you know, how it is functioning and how the congressional 
intent of the original creation of the program is being 
followed. And there is some evidence that that is not the case, 
and it may be challenging the program's future.
    And again, I am a huge supporter of 340B. My smaller, rural 
hospitals absolutely have to have this program. So I think--I 
just want to make it clear again on the record that I am a big 
supporter. But we do need a level of transparency, I think. And 
you know who else said that? Secretary Becerra. And who else 
said that? President Biden, in his budget. So, you know, drug 
shortages is one area, but also formulary access to lower-cost 
drugs, where generics can't get on formulas because there is 
not a big enough rebate and the list price isn't high enough.
    So thank you for that answer.
    And with that, Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Guthrie. Dr. Bucshon yields back. We have now completed 
members of the subcommittee, and we have one member of the full 
committee waiving on, and that is Mr. Balderson of Ohio.
    You are recognized for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr. Balderson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I didn't know you 
called me out like that.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Balderson. I am waived on, so thank you for allowing me 
the opportunity to do this. My first question is for Dr. 
Parker. Thank you all for being here, though.
    But I want to thank Richard Hudson for his leadership on 
this issue and for introducing the Medical and Health Stockpile 
Accountability Act. I was proud to cosponsor this bill along 
with Mr. Gottheimer and my fellow cochair of the Pandemic 
Preparedness Caucus, Mrs. Trahan. This important bill will 
provide real-time updates of medical and health supply 
inventories nationwide. This will eliminate the delays and 
errors we saw during the COVID pandemic and ensure that our 
local healthcare providers have the supplies they need when 
they need them.
    Dr. Parker, I agree with you on your assessment that our 
pandemic response lacks a central authority to set the agenda 
and provide direction across multiple departments and agencies. 
I am concerned, though, that President Biden has not--still not 
appointed a Director for the White House Office of Pandemic 
Preparedness and Response.
    Dr. Parker, how can Congress differentiate and prevent 
duplicative work between ASPR and this new White House officer?
    Dr. Parker. Well, yes, and I have some comments in my 
written testimony about that, and I think, one, you know, I do 
think it is a great idea that at least we have authorized a 
pandemic preparedness and response policy office in the White 
House. It is unclear, though, how it is going to be 
implemented. And I think that now is the opportunity to 
consider how can biodefense and global health security and 
pandemic preparedness be consolidated under a leadership 
structure at the National Security Council Office of Science 
and--Policy, however that is going to be done.
    It is the opportunity now to consolidate it and appoint a 
person that--I am going to use the analogy--a combatant 
commander-type person that can focus on what are the policies, 
what are the budgetary priorities, and what are the plans and 
strategies that are going to be needed and an implementation 
plan across this space of biodefense and pandemic preparedness 
and global health security that can then drive better milestone 
outcomes, provide the guidance that is needed for industry, and 
align medical countermeasure--in the case of medical 
countermeasures, the DoD programs, the HHS programs into a more 
singular focus.
    You still need to allow, though, for decentralized 
execution at the department agency levels. You don't want to 
micromanage from the White House. But you can do this. You need 
the combatant commander that will provide the vision, the 
strategy, and an implementation plan, and hold the Department 
and agencies accountable. And Congress can also hold the 
Department and agencies accountable for meeting their 
milestones and metrics.
    Mr. Balderson. Thank you. Follow up. I appreciate and agree 
with your statements on the better integrating and training 
State and local staff. Are there current examples of 
preparedness exercises or programs between State and local 
officials that we can look at as to a model?
    Dr. Parker. Well, I think over the years there has been a 
lot of, you know, like, national exercise, you know, and FEMA 
runs a national exercise program, and that usually involves 
State and local communities. And so we just need to do more of 
that. We don't do enough of it. And I think we need to be 
thinking about what are the scenarios that we might face, and--
because we might face some of these scenarios that I have 
talked about in my testimony, and we have done these--our 
Nation has done these in the past. But I think we need to go 
back and look at what are some of the truly catastrophic 
scenarios that we may face in the dangerous era that we find 
ourselves in now.
    Mr. Balderson. OK, thank you.
    Ms. Arthur, since I am the waiver-on guy, I don't want to 
be over my timeframe, so I am going to be pretty brief with 
you. I see that you chair the Healthcare Ready, which works 
with government, nonprofit, and medical supply chains to 
strengthen healthcare systems before, during, and after 
disasters.
    We all know that it is the private sector, not the 
Government, that leads, innovates, and advances. Can you 
explain when public-private partnerships are essential for 
resiliency versus times when Federal Government is in a way 
that is distracting?
    Ms. Arthur. Absolutely. So really, the healthcare system in 
America and the healthcare supply chain, in particular, is a 
private-sector endeavor. And that is what Healthcare Ready 
supports. It is extremely important, actually, therefore, that 
all the aspects, end to end, of the supply chain integrate with 
the Federal Government, State, and local governments as well, 
in terms of making sure we can have all hands on deck when we 
need to respond to an emergency situation.
    Mr. Balderson. Thank you very much, and thank you all for 
being here today.
    Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. There is nothing you would have to 
apologize for waiving on. It is certainly within the right of 
the committee. I just want to make sure everybody knew we have 
asked--let everybody ask questions moving forward. So thanks, 
thanks, Mr.--Troy, for being here today.
    And so we have concluded Members' questions. Thank you so 
much for your answers that have been very informative and been 
very helpful.
    But first, a couple of things for business.
    I ask unanimous consent to insert in the record the 
documents included on the staff hearing documents list, the 
list I just shared with you.
    Without objection, that will be in order.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Ms. Eshoo. So ordered.
    Mr. Guthrie. And I want to remind Members that they have 10 
business days to submit for the record questions for the 
record, and so that you could still receive questions even 
after the hearing. And so we just ask that you respond to any 
questions in writing promptly. Members should submit their 
questions by the close of business on the 27th of June.
    Again, thank you so much. I know it takes a lot of time and 
a lot of effort to be here to testify. It is very valuable. It 
really informs our decision making, and it means a lot to--for 
you to take the time and the effort that you may. Some of you 
travel some good distances to be here, and we appreciate it 
very much.
    And without objection, the subcommittee is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 1:39 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
    [Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:]
