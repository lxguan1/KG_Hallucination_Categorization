                                       U.S. Senate,
        Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room 
SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Maria Cantwell, 
Chairwoman of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Cantwell [presiding], Klobuchar, Schatz,

Warnock, Cruz, Thune, Moran, Fischer, Budd, Schmitt, Vance, 
Capito, and Lummis.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    The Chair. The Senate Commerce Committee will come to 
order. I appreciate all my colleagues being here this morning. 
For the United States to be a leader in aviation, we must set 
the gold standard for aviation safety.
    We know there is work to do, and we have a number of recent 
incidents that highlights the importance of continuing to make 
safety the top priority. Last week we saw how technology issues 
can impact airlines and the traveling public.
    Today, we welcome acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen to 
the Committee to help understand what went wrong with the NOTAM 
system and what actions the FAA is taking to make sure this 
never happens again.
    How do we make sure the agency has the necessary resources 
to modernize its IT infrastructure? And how do we ensure a 
safe, and efficient, and reliable network? How can we ensure 
our global competitive edge? Mr. Nolen understands these 
challenges.
    On January 11, he ordered the first national ground stop 
since 9/11, and this was a significant event. More than 1,300 
flights were canceled and more than 9,500 were delayed. Prior 
to leading the FAA, Mr. Nolen served as the head of the FAA's 
Office of Aviation Safety. With over 1 million registered 
aircraft, over 1 million active pilots, and over 50,000 flights 
every day, the Aviation Safety Office has a very big job.
    As an experienced airline pilot, Mr. Nolen understands the 
importance of the NOTAM system. These notices provide real time 
safety information, flight operations, and without access to 
this information, safe aircraft operations really are not 
possible. This hearing, like last week's, which I believe still 
shows the investment in technology that needs to be made--
Southwest could have updated their system, and didn't, and a 
critical event happened.
    Now we want to make sure a critical event like happened 
with our NOTAM system also doesn't happen, and how do we keep 
our economy moving forward. These incidents are concerning. 
They impact Americans' confidence in our aviation system and 
our aviation infrastructure is critical to American safety and 
security.
    So, we need to accelerate building a national airspace 
system for the 21st century, something this committee is going 
to work on as it relates to the FAA reauthorization bill. And 
the 2023 authorization bill will give us many opportunities to 
talk not just about this issue, but other issues that our 
appropriator colleagues also have to do their job. Over the 
last several years, Congress has met or exceeded the 
Administration's budget requests for the FAA facilities and 
NOTAM.
    But Mr. Nolen will talk today about additional funds, why 
Congress needs to paint--why a clear picture needs to be 
painted about the needs of our airspace system for the future. 
To be sure, the FAA must have redundancies and not a single 
point where a failure can happen in a key system like we just 
saw.
    And we have to have responsibilities to ensure that every 
taxpayer provides--that every taxpayer is provided a maximum 
value on return. Therefore, we must see clearly the obstacles 
ahead and what a path to make sure that we have this most 
modernized system.
    Today's discussion on NOTAM and national airspace are 
really part of a bigger picture. I am sure there will be other 
issues that come up today as events of the last several weeks 
have pointed out the roles of FAA in our airspace system, 
working with DOD and others.
    So, I look forward to the questions and opportunities to 
have you before the Committee to address these important, 
timely questions on. I will turn to the Ranking Member, Senator 
Cruz.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED CRUZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS

    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you, Acting 
Administrator Nolen, for being here. While I look forward to 
hearing from you, I have to say I am disappointed by the 
absence of a Senate confirmed witness like Secretary Buttigieg 
who ultimately oversees the agency responsible for the NOTAM 
failure.
    And I would note that Secretary Buttigieg, in my view, 
instead of engaging in politics, should be focused on the job 
he has now and addressing the very serious transportation 
crises we are seeing playing out across the country. On the 
afternoon of January 10, the FAA's notice to air mission system 
failed.
    About 15 hours later, after failing to reboot the system, 
the FAA ordered a full ground stop of the national airspace 
system for the first time since September 11, 22 years ago. The 
ground stop was because America was under attack. But this 
time, this ground stop was the result of the Federal agency's 
inability to modernize despite Congress providing the required 
resources to do so.
    The Washington Post called the ground stop, ``almost 
unprecedented'' and said the FAA, ``learned long ago their 
systems were dependent on rickety foundations but didn't do 
enough to update technology.'' Despite a similar outage in 
2008, the FAA still has not improved the system. A technology 
specialist involved in the 2008 outage blamed, ``organizational 
inertia,'' something I have heard many times before when people 
describe problems at the FAA.
    The Wall Street Journal said, ``given the importance of the 
FAA's mission, this kind of failure is hard to excuse.'' If 
glitches happen all the time, why doesn't the FAA have 
redundancy. Canada's NOTAM system offer--operated by a 
nonprofit, experienced apparently unrelated problems the same 
day as the United States.
    The planes there kept flying. The NOTAM breakdown last 
month was clearly a mistake. I fear it is emblematic of a 
culture afraid to innovate, stuck operating inefficiently, and 
illustrative of why President Biden needs to choose an 
administrator for the FAA with a proven ability to manage 
change within large organizations, and with the requisite 
aviation and safety experience.
    The current nominee that is pending lacks that aviation 
experience. The FAA safety mission, Mr. Nolen, as you know 
well, is too important to take for granted. There is a front-
page story in The Wall Street Journal today on the FAA's 
inability to modernize NOTAM. In that story, an FAA 
spokesperson claims that prioritizing NOTAM upgrades wouldn't 
guarantee funding from Congress. That is simply not true.
    Congress has fully funded NOTAM modernization for more than 
10 years. Every year since 2013, Congress has given as much or 
more than the amount requested by the Executive agency for 10 
years now. And yet, full modernization is still several years 
away. After investing millions of dollars, I am wondering why 
this bureaucracy is taking so long to do its job.
    And is the system worth modernizing at this point, because 
the status quo simply isn't acceptable. There must be 
accountability when an agency is not using taxpayer funds 
efficiently. And that, of course, starts with an accountable 
leader. Now in his third year as Secretary of Transportation, 
Secretary Buttigieg has failed to deliver any meaningful reform 
at the FAA.
    Although NOTAM modernization started a decade ago, this 
Administration seems focused on semantics. Whether it is 
replacing the term mother with birthing person or creating a 
new checkbox on passports for people who claim to be neither a 
man or woman, this Administration's desire to signal its virtue 
seems to know no limits. It has even infected the FAA.
    Instead of it focusing on safety, the FAA and DOT were 
working hard to change NOTAM's name from notice to airmen to 
notice to air missions. I would suggest instead, the focus 
should have been on making sure the damn thing worked. 
Shockingly, renaming NOTAM didn't prevent an outage. You know, 
way back in 1994, Al Gore proposed to reform the FAA into a 
self-funding, more efficient organization.
    Today, the flying public is stuck with a self-regulating 
and flailing agency stuck in the 20th century. It is my hope 
that we can use this hearing and the 2023 FAA reauthorization 
bill to explore meaningful reforms to the FAA and its air 
traffic organization. And let me say finally, in recent weeks, 
we have seen several very concerning near misses that were 
almost mass fatality crashes.
    We have seen them in New York. We have seen them in Austin, 
Texas. We just recently saw one outside of Hawaii. I know 
Texans and Americans across this country are deeply concerned 
about these near misses.
    And I hope, in addition to addressing the failure of the 
NOTAM system, that Mr. Nolen, you will also address these near 
misses, why they almost killed hundreds of people, and what 
more can be done to make sure that the next near miss doesn't 
become a horrific tragedy. Thank you.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Cruz. Now we will hear from 
the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, Senator Moran.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JERRY MORAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM KANSAS

    Senator Moran. Chairwoman, thank you. Thank you, to you and 
Senator Cruz, for this hearing. I am pleased to work beside 
you, and with you, and the other members of this committee as 
the Ranking Member of the Aviation subcommittee on Commerce, 
Science and Transportation. Kansas is the aviation capital of 
the world, with over a century's worth of rich aviation 
history.
    Whether manufacturing the first bomber in the B-52 or the 
next generation bomber in the B-21, Kansas, has driven and 
carried the aviation industry. Clusters of manufacturing 
navigation alongside academia and research in Kansas leads the 
aviation industry into the future. Yet the FAA is at a crucial 
junction, and we must do everything in our power to ensure the 
United States remains a leader in the aerospace innovation and 
safety. It is imperative for this committee to pass a long-term 
reauthorization.
    Prior to 2018, we had short-term reauthorizations totaling 
28. It is no wonder there is uncertainty at the FAA and in the 
industry when we are so challenged in getting our work done. 
Multi-year reauthorizations is necessary for long-term planning 
and growth in the civil aviation industry, including 
maintenance and modernization of aviation infrastructure and 
technology. I look forward to addressing the current backlog at 
the FAA.
    I agree with Senator Cruz that the FAA needs a Senate 
confirmed leader. We need to be able to address new 
technologies that are rapidly advancing so that the United 
States remains at the forefront and remains competitive in this 
world.
    I have worked with the Chairwoman of this subcommittee on 
advanced air mobility in the past, and further, we have worked 
together in advancing the aviation work force. We have 
significant challenges in the area of general aviation and 
aviation in general.
    The FAA is a significant component of that circumstance. It 
needs our help, but it also needs to get its act together. 
Madam Chairman, I have altered my subcommittee assignments 
within the Committee on Appropriations to add T-HUD, 
transportation to this opportunity to try to make a difference 
in this arena.
    And so, I look forward to really working with what I think 
is the kind of both points of view that has been expressed so 
far, leadership at the FAA, and the necessary resources for 
them to do their job well. Thank you.
    The Chair. Thank you. Well, we will definitely look forward 
to that leadership and working with all of us. I just want to 
note before we go to the witness that NOTAM stood for notice to 
airmen. And I know while people are somewhat bothered or think 
that this is not a change, or some people are saying that it 
is, you know, being too politically correct, we have a barrier 
problem here.
    We need more women in aviation. And fewer than 10 percent 
of the licensed pilots are women. About 5 percent of airline 
pilots, 3.6 percent of airline captains. So, I just want to say 
how proud I am that the two naval aviators that flew over the 
Super Bowl were from Whidbey Island and Whidbey Island Air 
Station.
    But I do think the changing is in the right direction, and 
we need to do more to encourage more women in aviation. So, Mr. 
Nolen, welcome to today's hearing. Your opening remarks. Thank 
you.

    STATEMENT OF BILLY NOLEN, ACTING ADMINISTRATOR, FEDERAL 
                    AVIATION ADMINISTRATION

    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, Madam Chair, Ranking Member Cruz, and 
members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to 
provide clarity on the FAA's management of the Notices to Air 
Mission system, share details on recent events, and explain our 
efforts to modernize the NOTAM system.
    Today is also an opportunity to discuss the modernization 
needs of the national airspace system overall, some of the 
challenges we face and some of the opportunities on the 
horizon. We are experiencing the safest period in aviation 
history, but we do not take that for granted. Recent events 
remind us that we cannot and must not become complacent and 
must continually invest in our aviation system.
    I know we are here to discuss the challenges we experienced 
with our NOTAM system last month, so I want to provide a brief 
background about what we know so far. Late on January 10, NOTAM 
applications and services became unreliable.
    Technical experts attempted to address the issue by, among 
other things, switching to the backup data base. While 
technical experts worked through the night, the FAA activated a 
hotline to provide real time status updates to airspace users.
    During this time, there were no reports of operational 
impacts. In the early morning, hours of January 11, the system 
appeared to have been restored, but formatting issues were 
persistent.
    To resolve this, FAA air traffic leadership directed the 
rebuild of the data bases. As the morning air traffic rush 
approached and work on the system continued, I ordered a ground 
stop at approximately 7:15 a.m. eastern time, pausing all 
departures in the United States in order to maintain safety and 
preserve predictability.
    I did so after consulting with the airlines and safety 
experts. Once resiliency testing on the system was conducted, I 
lifted the ground stop at 9:07 a.m. eastern time. The FAA's 
preliminary findings are that contract personnel 
unintentionally deleted files while working to correct 
synchronization issues between the live primary database and 
the backup data base. We have found no evidence of a 
cyberattack or other malicious intent.
    After the incident, we implemented a synchronization delay 
to ensure that bad data from one database cannot affect the 
backup data base.
    Additionally, we have implemented a new protocol that 
requires more than one individual to be present and engage in 
oversight when work on a database occurs. As part of our review 
of the root cause of this incident continues, please know that 
the FAA will keep the Committee apprised of our findings. As 
you are well aware, 2023 is a big year for aviation.
    Our current authorization expires on September 30th and 
there is sustained energy, from both industry and Government, 
around the development of ideas and proposals to modernize the 
NAS and the FAA's approach to managing it. As we delve into 
that reauthorization process, there are several important 
points we would like to highlight for the Committee.
    Right now, the FAA is managing three airspace systems to 
serve the diverse users of the NAS. The first is the classic or 
legacy system that many users still count on. The second is the 
system that relies on the next generation of technology for 
improved communication, navigation, and surveillance. The FAA 
has operationalized the foundational pieces of this system, and 
we continue to deploy services as operator equipage and Federal 
resources allow.
    The third is the future, a future that has already arrived. 
It is the system that must accommodate new entrants in all 
their forms, including drones, advanced air mobility aircraft, 
commercial spacecraft, and other new aircraft yet to be 
imagined.
    For us to sustain, implement, and plan for all of these 
systems, we have a lot of work ahead. We look forward to 
partnering with the Committee to ensure that the FAA's 
oversight and regulation of the NAS continues to deliver the 
level of aviation safety and efficiency expected by the 
American public.
    Before we get to questions, I want to take a moment to 
acknowledge some of the recent incidents that we have talked 
about, we have seen throughout the system. I am sure that you 
and the public have seen some of the news reports and close 
calls on runways and other operational events.
    Because I want to make sure we are giving the right amount 
of attention to all of these recent occurrences, I formed a 
safety review team to examine the U.S. aerospace system's 
structure, culture, processes, systems, and integration of 
safety effort. The initial focus will be to hold a safety 
summit to examine what additional actions the aviation 
community needs to take to maintain our safety record.
    A group of commercial and general aviation leaders, labor 
partners, and other will examine what mitigations are working 
and why others do not appear to be as effective. I can say 
without reservation that the aviation professionals who 
comprise the American aerospace industry are proud of our 
safety record.
    But we all know that complacency has no place in air 
transportation, whether it is on the flight deck, in the 
control tower, the ramp, or the dispatch center. We are 
confident that we are taking the right steps here, and we look 
forward to working with the Committee and this Congress in 
developing a long-term FAA reauthorization bill that 
accelerates the next era of aviation, one that is safe, 
efficient, sustainable, and open to all. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Nolen follows:]

       Prepared Statement of Billy Nolen, Acting Administrator, 
                    Federal Aviation Administration
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and members of the Committee, 
thank you for the opportunity to provide clarity on the Federal 
Aviation Administration's (FAA) management of the Notice to Air 
Missions (NOTAM) system, share details on recent events, and explain 
our efforts to modernize the NOTAM system.
    Today is also an opportunity to discuss the modernization needs of 
the national airspace system (NAS) overall, some of the challenges we 
face, and some of the opportunities on the horizon.
    We are experiencing the safest period in aviation history, but we 
do not take that for granted. Recent events remind us that we cannot 
become complacent and that we must continually invest in our aviation 
system.
NAS Modernization
    2023 will be a big year for aviation. Our current authorization 
expires on September 30th, and there is sustained energy from both 
industry and government around the development of ideas and proposals 
to modernize the NAS and the FAA's approach to managing it. As we delve 
into that reauthorization process, there are several important points 
we would like to highlight for the Committee. Right now, the FAA is 
managing three airspace systems to serve the diverse users of the NAS. 
The first is the classic or legacy system that many users of the NAS 
still count on. The second is the system that relies on the next 
generation of technology for improved communication, navigation, and 
surveillance. The FAA has operationalized the foundational pieces of 
this system, and we continue to deploy additional services as operator 
equipage and Federal resources allow. The third is the future--a future 
that has already arrived. It is the system that must accommodate new 
entrants in all their forms, including drones, advanced air mobility 
aircraft, commercial spacecraft, and other new aircraft yet to be 
imagined. It will involve autonomous aircraft, data exchanges, and a 
dynamic airspace. For us to sustain, implement, and plan for all of 
these systems, we have a lot of work ahead. We look forward to 
partnering with the Committee to ensure that the FAA's oversight and 
regulation of the NAS continue to deliver the level of aviation safety 
and efficiency expected by the American public, as new entrants come 
into service.
    On our end, we must work with stakeholders and make strategic 
investments, and create an agile regulatory structure that maintains 
safety, ensures efficiency, and facilitates access for new entrants. We 
are committed to this work and need Congress to be a supportive partner 
both in terms of enacting a long-term reauthorization measure, and 
funding our modernization needs. We look forward to working with you on 
these challenges and assure you that safety will always guide our 
actions no matter the challenge.
The NOTAM System
    A NOTAM contains essential information for airspace users providing 
safety information about particular aspects of the NAS that are not 
operating under normal status. FAA's NOTAM system is a dynamic system 
that captures recent changes to conditions in the NAS. For example, 
NOTAMs frequently provide pilots and operators with information about 
an anomaly with a particular navigational aid, airport runway, or 
taxiway, or about an air space closure or a temporary flight 
restriction.
    The FAA's overall NOTAM system consists of two systems--an older 
U.S. NOTAM System (legacy system) and a newer Federal NOTAM System. The 
older portion of the NOTAM system relies on 30-year-old software and 
architecture. This portion collates NOTAM data from all sources and 
distributes it to some airspace users. The Federal NOTAM System portion 
is newer and serves as part of the foundation for the FAA's ongoing 
NOTAM modernization effort.
    NOTAM information comes from a variety of places: an airport or air 
traffic control tower that observes local changes, an FAA technician 
planning to work on a system, or an air service provider, to name a 
few. Airspace users enter and access the information from applications 
sitting on both portions of the FAA's NOTAM system. Most airlines 
download NOTAMs from the FAA into their internal databases for 
dispatching aircraft. Users can also get NOTAMs from third party 
providers who get it from the FAA, or they can go to the primary source 
for specific NOTAM information, by calling a flight service station, 
air traffic control tower, or airport, for example.
NOTAM Service Interruption and Response
    Late on January 10, 2023, NOTAM applications and services became 
unreliable. Technical experts attempted to address the issue by, among 
other things, switching to a backup database. There are three NOTAM 
backup databases--one in Oklahoma City and two in Atlantic City. While 
technical experts worked through the night, the FAA activated a hotline 
to provide real-time status updates to system users. During this time, 
there were no reports of operational impacts. In the early morning 
hours of January 11, 2023, the system appeared to have been restored, 
but formatting issues persisted. To resolve this, FAA's air traffic 
leadership directed the rebuild of the databases.
    As the morning air traffic rush approached, and work on the system 
continued, I ordered a ground stop at approximately 7:15 a.m. EST, 
pausing all departures in the United States in order to maintain safety 
and preserve predictability. I did so after consulting with the 
airlines and safety experts. Once resiliency testing on the system was 
conducted, I lifted the ground stop at 9:07 a.m. EST on January 11, 
2023.
    The FAA's preliminary findings are that contract personnel 
unintentionally deleted files while working to correct synchronization 
between the live primary database and a backup database. We have found 
no evidence of a cyber-attack or other malicious intent. After the 
incident, we implemented a synchronization delay to ensure that bad 
data from a database cannot affect a backup database. Additionally, we 
have implemented a new protocol that requires more than one individual 
to be present and engaged in oversight when work on the database 
occurs. As our review of the root causes of this incident continue, 
please know that the FAA will keep the Committee apprised of our 
findings.
NOTAM Modernization
    Beginning in 2012 with the Pilot's Bill of Rights (Public Law 112-
153) and continuing in 2018 with the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 
(Public Law 115-254), which further amended the Pilot's Bill of Rights, 
Congress directed the FAA to continue developing and modernizing the 
NOTAM repository, in a public central location, in a manner that is 
Internet-accessible, machine-readable, and searchable. Since those 
enactments, the FAA has made progress modernizing the NOTAM system. 
This progress includes improvements not only to the NOTAM content and 
presentation/publication, but also to the information technology 
architecture that supports and delivers this vital safety information. 
The nearly decade-long modernization work includes transitioning away 
from the legacy portion of the system mentioned earlier. We expect that 
a significant portion of the modernization work will be complete by 
mid-2025. We continue to assess the feasibility of accelerating the 
current schedule.
    The goal of the FAA's NOTAM modernization effort is to provide 
NOTAMs that are complete, accurate, timely, and relevant to safe flight 
operations. The FAA has made great progress in fulfilling the 
congressional mandates for modernization, including close coordination 
with industry and the adoption of recommendations from industry 
stakeholders that use NOTAMs. Specifically, the FAA is working in 
coordination with the Aeronautical Information Services Reform 
Coalition (coalition), whose members include representatives from, 
among others, air carriers, aircraft owners, pilots, airport 
executives, labor interests of air carriers, general and business 
aviation, and international operators. Our continued work with the 
coalition is one of the many examples where a government-industry 
partnership has helped to significantly inform and improve the 
direction and quality of our work.
    We are working to face the challenges in maintaining our systems 
while keeping pace with new and emerging technologies and entrants. 
However, we are committed to improving and securing our systems, 
finding new ways to be agile in order to face these challenges, and 
continuing to achieve the highest levels of safety and efficiency. We 
look forward to working with the Committee and this Congress in 
developing a long-term FAA reauthorization bill that accelerates the 
next era of aviation--one that is safe, efficient, sustainable, and 
open to all.

    The Chair. Thank you, Acting Director Nolen, and appreciate 
that. Let's drill down on the NOTAM system. One of the issues, 
from my understanding and you are saying that this involved an 
individual deleting the wrong set of files. We have a backup 
redundant system, why couldn't we just go to that system?
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, Madam Chair, for the question. So, we 
do have a backup system. A part of how the system works is that 
as you do updates to the system, as you delete outdated NOTAMs, 
it synchronizes across both the primary backup and the other 
two backups. So, part of that is synchronization, once we 
realize it, once we come----
    The Chair. So, the structure of the architecture is not 
favorable to true redundancy.
    Mr. Nolen. Which is one of the reasons we are in the middle 
of this whole modernization effort. We have got----
    The Chair. You are agreeing with me, is that right?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am. I am agreeing with you that we have 
a 30-year-old system. We have a new system. Let me just say to 
the point. 80 percent of the users are already on our newer 
system, which is the Federal NOTAM system.
    We still have some critical users on the U.S. NOTAM system, 
which is this 30-year-old. Primarily you have DOD, you have the 
Alaska, aviation in Alaska, and our international users are 
still on that system. But again, we are working to be off of 
that system by Fiscal Year 2025.
    The Chair. So, I think, you know, the NTSB is--you know, 
the authorization bill, we wanted to make progress on this, and 
so they are basically saying that we aren't making progress on 
this. What is your response to how we are going to fill not 
waiting until 2025?
    I get that you are saying now I am going to back up on the 
human factor, really, is what you are saying. I am going to 
back up on the human factor and make sure that this never 
happens because of an individual, one individual being on the 
spot.
    But really, it is the architecture of the system that 
doesn't give us true redundancy. So, is there a way to solve 
that before we, you know, go 2 years into the modernization?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, we will continue on this journey of 
modernization. I have asked and I have directed our teams to 
look at what is our ability to accelerate that timeline. Can we 
pull it into--?
    The Chair. I am asking you, what can you do about the 
existing system today to give you true redundancy? You are 
trying to give me human factor redundancy in another 
individual, but when in reality I am pointing out that the 
architecture of the system isn't true redundancy because if the 
deletion impacted both systems--.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes--.
    The Chair. Then you don't really have redundancy. You don't 
have a separate, you know, reboot. You know, our electricity 
goes off on our house, we go to the generator, if you have one, 
right.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes.
    The Chair. So, in this case, the backup didn't work either 
because it was affected by the same deletion. So, you don't 
have to answer all of it right here, but I need an answer on 
this issue of redundancy to the system.
    Because while we want to modernize, and we want to have the 
right resources, and we got a pretty good offer from our 
colleague to drill down with this on the Appropriations side to 
make sure that we have a clear understanding--and I really do 
think this has been an issue in the past.
    I really do think that appropriators need to understand the 
technology needs of the FAA and support them. But what can we 
do now to make sure this doesn't happen again?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you. Several things that we have 
done. Number one, we have instituted a 1-hour synchronization 
delay between the primary database and the backup data base.
    That gives us time to make sure that we have no issues 
there. Second, we have increased the level of oversight to 
ensure the more than one person is available when work or 
updates are being done on the live data base, along with an 
upgrading or up leveling our level of oversight within the 
Command Center to ensure that we have got leadership present.
    So those, of course, are more in the area of administrative 
controls. But the work continues to get off of the U.S. NOTAM 
system and on to the Federal----
    The Chair. I am going to come back at you and ask that you 
work with contractors to find out how to get us true redundancy 
in the short term in a backup database that is truly 
independent and could operate at the same instance if this 
happens again.
    Before I--so my sense of this near-miss with Southwest 
Airlines and a cargo carrier, was Southwest in a position 
earlier than their slot? Is that what happened?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, what happened in Texas, in Austin, is that 
something we would not expect to happen during a low visibility 
operation where Southwest was cleared for take-off, and FedEx, 
who was cleared for approach, in close proximity to each other.
    That investigation is underway by the National 
Transportation Safety Board and the FAA. So, we are looking at 
every aspect of it and we will certainly provide updates. But 
it is not something we expected to have taken place. Rightfully 
so, the FedEx crew, Southwest----
    The Chair. I am asking if you have an answer today about 
why this occurred?
    Mr. Nolen. No, ma'am. That investigation is still ongoing, 
but we will certainly provide an update.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Acting Administrator 
Nolen, the FAA has been charged with modernizing NOTAM for 10 
years. Why has it taken 10 years, and why isn't it done yet?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you, Senator Cruz, for the question. 
We have been on a journey of modernization. Starting back in 
2009, as we began the scoping and we brought on, in 2013, we 
brought on the Federal NOTAM system.
    So that process, and we have had enhancements along the 
way. We are about for--the substantive part of that 
modernization.
    Senator Cruz. Let me ask again, why has it taken 10 years 
and why is it still not done that?
    Mr. Nolen. It does take a while. These systems--the 
complexity of our NAS. The NOTAM is just one of thousands of 
systems that comprise how we oversee the NAS, how we 
communicate, how we are given NOTAMs. This is how----
    Senator Cruz. And if I heard you right, your current plan 
is not to have it modernized until Fiscal Year 2025. So, 2 to 3 
years from now. What is to prevent another ground stop in the 2 
to 3 years between now and then?
    Mr. Nolen. When I say we are moving to 2025, the work is 
ongoing. We do have 80 percent of the users onto the Federal 
NOTAM system. We have added redundancies to ensure that----
    Senator Cruz. But the 80 percent of users, if I understand 
you correct, that didn't stop a ground stop of everybody, is 
that correct?
    Mr. Nolen. It did. When we did a ground stop, that was a 
ground stop for all departing traffic on Des Moines.
    Senator Cruz. So, the 80 percent didn't help. It is not 
like it was only a 20 percent ground stop. Everyone shut down, 
the first time since 9/11. Let me ask you, I agree very, very 
strongly with the questions that the Chairwoman Cantwell raised 
about redundancy. And do the fixes that you proposed remove the 
risk of a similar single point of failure for knocking the 
NOTAM system offline?
    Mr. Nolen. We believe the fixes that we have in place today 
will prevent a recurrence of the event that we saw on January 
the 11th.
    Senator Cruz. Mr. Nolen, you are not answering the 
question. Will the fixes remove the risk of a similar single 
point of failure from knocking the system out? Is there 
redundancy being built into it, or can a single screw up ground 
air traffic nationwide?
    Mr. Nolen. We have--when we think about the age of our 
system and the age of systems we have, we do have redundancy 
there. Could I sit here today and tell you there will never be 
another issue on the NOTAM system?
    No, sir, I cannot. What I can say is that we are making 
every effort to modernize and look at our procedures. In fact, 
part of this investigation has us working with MITRE and other 
entities to look at the across the totality of our systems, how 
they interrelate, what is the level of redundancy, and is there 
any additional thing that we need to do?
    And certainly, we will have more as an investigation 
ensues.
    Senator Cruz. Well, I think you are going to see, as you 
have seen, bipartisan interest in assisting the FAA in ensuring 
redundancy so that we don't see air traffic grounded again. And 
in focusing more broadly, I hope, on modernization of air 
traffic control. I want to shift to the near crashes we have 
had.
    And understandably, I am particularly focused on what 
happened in Austin. Two weeks ago, there was a near collision 
on the runway at Austin-Bergstrom Airport. A Southwest flight 
was taking off from that runway, a FedEx plane was preparing to 
land. They came incredibly close to crashing. Millions of 
Texans fly every year.
    I have flown on Southwest flights out of Austin literally 
hundreds, if not thousands, of times. I actually have a video 
that was created that is a reproduction of what happened. It is 
a recreation, but it is based on the flight data, so if we 
could play that video and I would like to get your reaction to 
it.
    [Video playing.].
    Senator Cruz. So, I know the incident is under 
investigation. If you are sitting in that Southwest flight, you 
knew how close you came to having a plane land on top of you, 
killing every person on that plane, you would understandably be 
horrified. It is only through, as I understand it, the heroism 
of the pilots being alert and seeing what was happening, that 
that tragedy was averted.
    And yet my question is, how can this happen? How did air 
traffic control direct one plane onto the runway to take off 
and another plane to land, and have them both within 100 feet 
of each other? And what can we do to make sure that doesn't 
happen again?
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, Senator Cruz, for the question. 
Certainly, we are letting the investigation play itself out. 
Having been an airline captain and having been a pilot for more 
than 42 years and an accident investigator, we will go where 
the facts take us.
    What is not represented on the video there, it appears to, 
you know, eye clear, below in 22 days is what we would say in 
pilot jargon. But actually, when the tower of visibility was 
zero, it was a low visibility day, it is not what we would 
expect to have happen.
    But when we think about the controls, how we train both our 
controllers and our pilot, the system works as it is designed 
to avert what you say could have been a horrific outcome. The 
pilots saw, the FedEx pilots saw----
    Senator Cruz. Well, let me just underscore the urgency of 
preventing that sort of incident from happening again.
    Mr. Nolen. Absolutely. Yes, sir.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Schatz. Oh, I am sorry, 
Senator Klobuchar. I am sorry. Oh, Senator Schatz. OK, thank 
you.

                STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN SCHATZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII

    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Madam Chair, Vice Chair--Ranking 
Member. Administrator Nolen--and I want to welcome Senator 
Moran to the T-HUD Committee, because I think it is important 
to note that we did fully fund the budget request for NOTAM 
modernizations efforts in the last spending bill, but there are 
efforts to cut Federal spending.
    And I want to ask you a very simple question, should we 
expect flight delays and cancellations going forward if we 
defund or underfund these transformations?
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, Senator Schatz for the question. It 
is clear, as I said in my opening comments, that as we are on 
this modernization journey, we are on it with you.
    So having the funding that we need, and yes, certainly we 
get to places where either we have got starts and stops, or we 
are into CRs, et cetera, having that funding there so that that 
ongoing work can be done. And where we have the capability and 
ability, we want to be able to accelerate that.
    Senator Schatz. So here is my question for you, we do our 
job, you do your job. If we pass a proper appropriations bill, 
fully funding your request, can you commit to meeting the 
deadlines and schedules already established for the 
improvements to NOTAM?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir. We remain on track to get that done.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you very much. You have got a bunch 
of ongoing projects, and I want to talk to you about how you 
prioritize. You have modernizing NOTAM, Next Gen, and then 
integrating unmanned aircraft commercial space launches, urban 
air mobility technologies.
    How are you--I mean, the money is one thing, but you also 
have a throughput capacity problem in terms of leadership and 
analysis and all the rest of it. How are you racking and 
stacking those priorities? I know you are going to say, look, 
we got to do it all, but in reality, agencies have to 
prioritize. I am wondering how you are doing that?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you for the question. You are 
absolutely right. Our first priority has been and always will 
be safety, and the safety of the NAS. So, when we think about 
things that contribute to the safety of the NAS, that is at the 
top of the list. And then we think about there is a security 
aspect.
    And certainly, we work in partnership with TSA and other 
authorities to ensure that our airspace is secure. Last, when 
we think about, you know--or not really last, but when we think 
about the efficiency.
    So those pieces of modernization that provides efficiency, 
which the flying public enjoys as well, those are the things we 
work on. So, when we think about Next Gen, what we are doing 
there, and from a enterprise risk perspective as it relates to 
the NAS, that is really what informs which programs and 
priorities rise to the top of our list.
    Senator Schatz. I want to move to another topic. NORAD has 
adjusted its radars to be more sensitive to detecting potential 
UAPs, leading to an uptick in picking up potential incursions. 
Is the FAA adjusting status of airspace quickly, as regularly 
as NORAD may need to respond to incidents?
    And I guess more generally, can you tell us how you are 
transforming your systems to be integrated into what we know 
from our national security folks and the Department of Defense? 
A lot of this has FAA implications. I do think increasing--and 
increasing the sensitivity of the radars makes perfect sense.
    I also do think that there may be instances now where we 
are going to--you are going to get a ping on the radar that is 
a flock of birds or some other not particularly dangerous--I 
shouldn't say birds are not dangerous.
    I am aware of bird strikes. But the point is it doesn't 
rise to the national security level. And so how are you sorting 
this and what changes are you currently in the middle of? I 
don't expect you to have a fully formed answer, but I would 
like to be reassured that you are working with our partners in 
DOD to get this right.
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you very much for the question. 
Again, we are indeed. We coordinate, collaborate, partner on 
everything that you are talking about. We have a liaison 
officer embedded at NORAD, and we also have DOD folks at our 
National Operation Command Center.
    So, if you were to be at the Command Center, you would see 
that you have got representatives, certainly from the industry, 
but you have got representatives from Government. We are 
looking at cyber.
    We are looking at UAS. All the things that you speak about, 
there is a high level of coordination across the whole of 
Government when it comes to the security of our airspace.
    Senator Schatz. Final question. It has been publicly 
reported, and I don't know that it is true, that the changing 
the dials on the sensitivities of the radars is something that 
can be done retroactively. In other words, for the past that 
you have data sets that you could actually tweak and then that 
might inform our national security folks in terms of how many 
of these UAPs were flying and over what period of time. Can you 
tell us anything about that?
    Mr. Nolen. We have capabilities within our commands and we 
have capabilities in terms of our radar, in terms of what we 
can see, where we don't see. Again, it is a partnership effort 
and it is a whole of Government approach.
    Senator Schatz. The specific question is, do you have the 
capability to go backward?
    Mr. Nolen. Go backward? I am sorry, could you----
    Senator Schatz. Go backward in time and say, look, I want 
to know in 2018, let's say, the extent of these UAPs by taking 
the data that you have, that probably nobody is looking at, 
understandably, because it is in the past, and changing the 
sensitivity on the data set. And then that would tell us 
something about what was happening in the past. Do you know if 
we have that capability?
    Mr. Nolen. I do not. And certainly, I would be happy follow 
up.
    Senator Schatz. If you would get back to us. Thank you.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Moran.
    Senator Moran. Thank you, Chairman. Mr. Nolen, thank you 
for your presence here today. Thank you for the conversation 
you had with me by phone on January 11, January 12. I 
appreciate that.
    There has been conversations at the FAA and within the 
industry whether the agency should change the systems 
classification from, the NOTAM systems classification, from 
mission support to safety critical. Comments or thoughts?
    Mr. Nolen. Senator Moran, thank you for that question. 
Certainly, that is one of the directions that I have given our 
team. Let's go back.
    And so, part of this look is taking a look at all of our 
enterprises and those we consider critical to the NAS versus 
the support, so we are absolutely taking a look at the 
classification there and make sure that we have got it right.
    Senator Moran. And what would be the difference, if it was 
reclassified? What would be the consequences?
    Mr. Nolen. Some of the differences are just the levels of 
controls and engineering controls that you would have in place 
for a critical system, and those added levels of redundancy 
that you would expect to have given the criticality of them.
    Senator Moran. Senator Klobuchar and I have introduced the 
NOTAM Improvement Act. Any thoughts on whether that would be of 
assistance to you and the FAA?
    Mr. Nolen. We fully support the goals that you have both 
put forward here. And I--it is much of what we are working 
toward, so we are very supportive of that.
    Senator Moran. Let me talk about a specific technology 
update. Spotlight on FAA's aging infrastructure. Would you 
comment on the status of replacing instrument landing systems 
located at hundreds of airports across the country? My 
understanding, at the current pace, FAA's current pace of 
modernization, it will take more than 100 years to replace 
those critical systems.
    Mr. Nolen. We have undertaken a body of work to say, you 
know, again, I have talked about these three NASs that we 
support. And so, when you look at that, we would love to be 
able to sunset some technology. Sunset systems where that have 
been replaced by satellite, GPS satellite-based navigation.
    And our ability to go do that--so we do have a plan in 
place to see how can we draw down where we have more than 
adequate replacement for that. So that is a piece of work that 
we are undertaking.
    Senator Moran. In 2017, I was part of a bipartisan group 
that introduced legislation that became law. It is called 
Modernizing Government Technology Act, and it creates a fund 
for Federal agencies to use savings obtained through 
streamlining its IT systems, replacing legacy products, and 
transition to cloud computing for additional modernization 
efforts.
    So, it allows an incentive for agencies, departments to 
utilize, take those steps, and then they have the money to 
acquire additional latest technology. To date, that fund has 
invested in 35 Government IT modernization projects across 19 
Federal agencies. The largest project investment was $187 
million.
    Considering NOTAM modernization is to--the goal is to 
transition to entirely new platform, has the--has the 
Department of Transportation, FAA has ever considered utilizing 
that modernization fund to improve NOTAM, and is there a why or 
why not?
    Mr. Nolen. I certainly have to follow up with you on that 
question, sir.
    Senator Moran. Perhaps I am just pointing out there is an 
opportunity for assistance.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you.
    Senator Moran. Thank you. Thank you for your service.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, sir.
    The Chair. Senator Klobuchar.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much, Senator Cantwell. 
And thank you for this hearing. And thank you, to you, Mr. 
Nolen. Senator Moran mentioned our work on this bill, which I 
am going to get to, but I did appreciate you talking to both of 
us after that 2-hour ground stop and the work that needs to be 
done with our air traffic system. What do you see as some of 
the biggest challenges in strengthening the resiliency and 
reliability of the system right now?
    Mr. Nolen. Our focus is, number one, is always ensure that 
the system is operating every day. So, every day in our 
Nation's airspace, we have 45,000 flights. That is just over 16 
million a year. And we do it very safely, day in and day out. 
And we have gone 15 years--14 years, I am sorry, without a 
fatal accident.
    That is nearly 230 million flights, nearly a $1 billion in 
payments a year. So, our system is very safe. At the same time, 
we don't take that safety for granted. And we recognize we have 
to continue this journey of modernization. So, if I--when I 
look out and I look for risk, overall, I have a good sense 
about where we are.
    Can I say to the American public that we are safe? The 
answer is that we are. If the question is, can we better be 
better? The answer is absolutely, and that is the piece we are 
working on.
    Senator Klobuchar. And so, you are looking at transitioning 
out of this legacy system, and what are your biggest obstacles 
to do that?
    Mr. Nolen. It is all about ensuring, again, that we have 
that funding there. And we will look forward to having, you 
know, what comes forward in the President's budget. Our goal is 
to take every dollar that we are given, and we are--our goal is 
to be good stewards of that and move forward to modernization.
    So again, we are talking thousands of systems that NOTAM is 
just one of, and so we don't want to leave the Committee with 
the impression that if we fix NOTAMs and we are done. And I 
know, you know, that is not where we are. But we will certainly 
have a prioritization about how we get there. NOTAMs is a big 
one. We want to continue to deliver on the benefits of NextGen.
    Everything we have done there, even as we stare into the 
future to say, how do we enable all these new entrants that are 
coming in?
    Senator Klobuchar. Right. And we mentioned, Senator Moran 
mentioned the bill we have with Senator Capito. And the point 
there is that it would create a task force, as you know, to 
bring everyone to the table. It actually passed the House, for 
my colleagues to note, led by represents Stauber of Minnesota.
    He is got the Duluth Airport up there. And it passed the 
House in the 116th and 117th Congress last time, 424 to 4. So, 
I am hoping we can get that done, and whatever input you have, 
I think the sooner we do that, the better. And then as we work 
toward the FAA reauthorization on a separate track.
    And I have the last question. And the focus I want to make 
here is just the workforce issue. We know that every industry 
practically in America is having workforce issues, including 
airlines and including you guys.
    And I know that Senators Duckworth, Thune, Moran, Fischer, 
Kelly, and many others, the leadership of Chair Cantwell, are 
working to expand the FAA's workplace development grant 
programs to boost investments. Could you talk about that 
pipeline of skilled aviation workers, and what you think we 
should do?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes. It is a great question. We look out and 
say, how do we become a more inclusive agency? How do we really 
reach out and touch underrepresented group? It is one of our 
absolute top priorities for the agency. When we think about it, 
I know there is part of that narrative, are we seeing a younger 
work force?
    The answer to that is yes. Are we attracting the kind of 
talent that we need? The answer to that is also yes. As we were 
looking to bring on more air traffic controllers, we reached 
out with a campaign of finding folks who are wanting to be part 
of the FAA and we expect that about 10,000, wound up with about 
87,000 applications.
    So, we are doing, you know, we are heavily involved in STEM 
and AVSED, and our outreach to both universities, as well as 
minority serving institutions, are all part of our ongoing 
effort across the agency and the department to ensure that we 
are really leaning in there.
    Senator Klobuchar. All right. Thank you very much. 
Appreciate it, Mr. Nolen.
    The Chair. Senator Thune.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA

    Senator Thune. Thank you, Madam Chair, for holding this 
important hearing. During my time as Chairman of this 
committee, we considered and enacted the FAA Reauthorization 
Act of 2018, which included several provisions related to 
bolstering the Nation's air traffic control system and 
improving the experience of the flying public.
    As the next FAA reauthorization approaches, it is essential 
that modernizing the Nation's air traffic control system 
remains a top priority. As I have said before, I am deeply 
concerned about the FAA's slow progress on NextGen.
    Despite robust funding from Congress and numerous 
legislative directives from this committee to complete such an 
essential modernization initiative in a timely manner. Travel 
disruptions, especially those related to recent ATC issues and 
the failure of the NOTAM system in January, have only 
highlighted the critical importance of technology 
modernization, especially as it relates to improving management 
of the national airspace system.
    So, I look forward to this discussion, and Acting 
Administrator Nolen, thank you for being here to testify. As I 
previously mentioned, the implementation of NextGen is going to 
be crucial in the coming years.
    These investments, as well as employing concepts such as 
dynamic airspace management, will allow the United States and 
better utilize existing infrastructure, increasing the capacity 
and efficiency of the NAS.
    Recent ATC issues at airports across the country have 
certainly highlighted the need for modernization. So, could you 
describe how FAA is working to get back on schedule to 
implement the various priorities of NextGen in a timely manner?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question, Senator 
Thune. So, we continue to work and to deliver on the benefits 
of NextGen. When we think about the work we have done, again, 
around navigation, around communication, one of the--a couple 
of those successes is by going from voice to data, where we 
have been able to eliminate, we believe, over 130,000 misread 
clearances.
    And we understand that is a big issue. We continue to work 
on metroplexes that we have around the country. That has been a 
big effort. 11 of those in places. When we think about, we have 
optimized profile descents.
    So that ability to descend now the altitude without the 
stepped downs that were a thing of the past, those have become 
more a thing of the past now, that allows certainly as a fuel 
saving and as an efficiency piece.
    That ability for us to be able to have airlines know when 
the push off to the gate so that you are off the gate and to 
the runway. All of those are efforts that we are doing and we 
continue to do.
    We work closely with the NextGen Advisory Committee. We got 
the Advanced Aviation Advisory Committee, we have the Drone 
Advisory Committee, and all of those committees inform the work 
that we do. And we are looking--we continue to look for 
opportunities. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, one of the 
challenges we face and will continue to face with NextGen is 
that level of equipage.
    Not everyone is equipped to the same level. And so that 
ability to take advantage of all that NextGen can deliver in 
the moment in many respects will depend on what the industry 
has equipped to. So that is a challenge for, and we will 
continue to work through it.
    Senator Thune. So, I mean, and it is just been--it has been 
a very slow process with lots of delays. And I am concerned 
that by the time many of these initiatives that you are talking 
are completed, they are going to be already outmoded or 
obsolete in comparison to the latest technology. So what 
actions is the FAA taking to avoid this issue as NextGen 
implementation continues?
    Mr. Nolen. It is one of continued, you know, partnership 
and collaboration. We are an ongoing, almost on a daily, weekly 
basis with the airline industry, and with, you know, partners 
around the world in terms of how do we get better at that.
    The journey we are on is there and airlines, the industry 
are seeing the benefits of it. There is more work to be done, 
undoubtedly. Again, back to the equipage piece there, there are 
just certain things you have to have to be able to do a 
particular approach, for example.
    Our ability to sunset some of the legacy systems, some 
ILSs, NDVs, things like that, now that we have GPS based 
navigation, right. So, it is our ability to work collectively 
and have that--a similar vision between us in the industry 
about what we want to achieve and how quickly we can get there.
    Senator Thune. So, as this committee looks toward 
developing this FAA reauthorization bill, do you believe there 
are opportunities for the FAA to incorporate adaptive or 
dynamic airspace management technologies into its NextGen 
initiative, or otherwise enhance real time inter-agency 
coordination with the Pentagon and other stakeholders?
    And I tell you that because we have an Air Force base in a 
training area, the Powder River Training Complex, and the B-1 
currently operates there, B-21 is coming in. We are going to 
get the first training unit, formal training unit and first 
operations unit there. And we really need the FAA's help on 
this. And it is something we have been focused on for a long 
time. Can you comment on that?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, I would say we are strong partners, not 
only with the DOD, to ensure that we can work together and that 
we are aligned. And when we think about airspace in the 
airspace uses, we are a strong partner and we really, we 
welcome the suggestion and we look forward to seeing how do we 
do more of it.
    Senator Thune. Well, I hope we can count on your help on 
that, because it has become--it is one of the biggest obstacles 
to large force training exercises and the types of, you know, 
capabilities that we can use or would benefit from in that 
airspace. So I hope you can help us.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, sir.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Hickenlooper, then Senator 
Fischer, then Senator Markey.

             STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN HICKENLOOPER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Nolen, 
thank you for your time and your public service. As space 
transportation becomes more common in the U.S., integrating 
space data, international airspace system operations is going 
to become increasingly more and more important.
    Maintaining a safe and efficient shared airspace and 
mitigating delays caused by commercial space launches become 
more--increasingly more important, as I said. So, Mr. Nolen, 
can you describe the FAA's efforts to coordinate with the 
commercial space industry, to integrate space data into 
national airspace operations?
    Why is the status of the FAA's Space Data Integration 
Program, or what is the state, status of the FAA's Space Data 
Integration Program to improve airspace safety and efficiency?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes. Well, thank you very much, Senator, for the 
question. We, our work there with the space data integrator is 
ongoing and certainly already bearing fruits. It has provided 
us, meaning the FAA, the ability to reduce the airspace that we 
need to block off for flights.
    This year, we saw--last year, I am sorry, we saw a record 
number of space launches and we are expecting to see at least 
one and a half time, if not double the amount that we saw last 
year.
    So this is a key technology that we are working to make 
sure--that will help us make our airspace more efficient and 
reduce the amount of closures, and the ability to reopen 
airspace faster. So that is a piece that we are working on.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. I appreciate that. Thank you.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you.
    Senator Hickenlooper. And I have my requisite NOTAM 
question as well. At Denver International Airport alone, the 
NOTAM failure resulted in 800 delayed or canceled flights. 
Smaller regional airports in Colorado also experienced delays 
and cancellations, significantly impacting airport operations, 
airport customers, and commerce.
    So, Mr. Nolen, can you describe what technical operational 
improvements the FAA is taking to make sure this kind of 
operation disruption does not occur again in those smaller 
markets, as well as the large airports?
    Mr. Nolen. We attempt to do our very best job, and 
certainly we will make sure--we will take away the point about 
how well we communicate and coordinate.
    It should be noted for the Committee that on just any given 
day, every 2 hours, there is an update from the National 
Command Center that airports, airlines, and others can tune 
into. We also have stakeholders who are present in the Command 
Center on the floor. So our goal is to make sure that we have 
got good communication.
    I do know from my team that this particular outage was 
indeed communicated out to airports and in a timely manner. But 
we will look for opportunities to say, can we make that even 
faster and more efficient.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Got it. Great. I appreciate that. 
Last, the FAA is facing a number of critical issues ranging 
including technical upgrades, the new entrance into the 
national airspace, as I mentioned, growing the aviation work 
force, a critical issue, making sure that there is more 
diversity, more equity in that work force.
    Based on your experience as Acting Administrator, what 
skills and experiences do you think are critical to lead an 
agency like FAA?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, you know, as we think about that, and 
whoever leads FAA, that choice belongs to the President. And I 
know the President has made a choice, and I certainly support 
the President's choice in that.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right. I wanted to--giving you an 
opportunity to do what I will now do and just say that I think 
Phil Robb--Phil Washington, who is the nominee to become the 
Administrator, really does have the skills and capabilities 
necessary to really turn around our aviation system.
    He rose to the rank of Command, made Sergeant Major in the 
Army, 24 years in the Army. And I think he is someone who is 
used to getting things done, coming in, helping get people all 
on the same page and really focused. He was the CEO of the 
Regional Transportation District in metropolitan Denver for 
almost 12 years and helped turn around a major transportation 
initiative.
    And then he has also been CEO of Los Angeles County 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and for a number of 
years now, the CEO of Denver International Airport, the third 
busiest airport in the world.
    And I think that array of experience, while not all in 
aviation, is all transportation connected and so many of these 
same situations that come up again and again in the aviation 
sector. Anyway, comment if you want, or I will just leave it 
there and say, we need to get a permanent Administrator in 
place as soon as we can.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, sir.
    The Chair. Senator Fischer.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DEB FISCHER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA

    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Administrator 
Nolen, welcome. Thank you for your service.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you.
    Senator Fischer. This past week, we have seen NORAD track 
numerous unidentified objects in the North American airspace. I 
served on the Armed Services committee as well, and I am the 
ranking Republican on strategic forces, which has oversight 
over missile defense, so I am interested in protocol.
    And I visited with NORTHCOM and NORAD about that. But I 
would like to know if there is any process in place where 
civilian pilots that detect an unknown object while in flight, 
do they report the incident to FAA? Do you have any connection, 
then, with DOD on it? What are the protocols that you have?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you, Senator Fischer, for the 
question. I will just relay to, you know, from my own time when 
I was an airline captain, there have been times of fire where 
you see a balloon and certainly that typically as a pilot you 
would report that to air traffic control. It may be something 
they already know about.
    And to the extent of they are worried about, there have 
been times when I have flown where it would say, be advised 
that we have a high altitude balloon, yes, x distance, x place. 
So there are processes in place to report.
    And then we have, as I mentioned earlier, an embedded team 
with NORAD. We have strong connections with the Department of 
Defense, Homeland Security, TSA, et cetera. So there is this 
whole of Government approach to protecting the homeland and 
protecting our skies.
    Senator Fischer. And as far as you know, those protocols 
are followed?
    Mr. Nolen. The protocols for reporting? It depends. You 
know, I am going to say that may be spotty. Just, and I take 
that just from my own personal experience. You know, will 
everybody report that they saw a balloon? The answer there is 
probably, no.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you. In 2021, the Inspector General 
report, it was cited that the FAA struggles to carry out its 
role to integrate new technologies and capabilities across 
various offices within the agency.
    Integrating new technologies and certification will be a 
priority as I work on the FAA reauthorization. How is FAA 
addressing concerns in the IG report in regards to the NextGen 
office and integrating new technologies? I know you have 
visited some with Senator Moran about that and also NextGen 
with Senator Thune, but could you address that specifically?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am, I would--firstly, I would push back 
against the notion that the FAA is in any way wavering on our 
mission to make our airspace, which is the most complex in the 
world, as efficient as we can, even as we embrace new entrants.
    We have already set in place processes to say, how do we 
enable new entrants, what is the regulatory framework they will 
need to operate, and then how do we get them integrated into 
our airspace.
    Senator Fischer. Is it going as quickly as you had hoped?
    Mr. Nolen. It is going with speed. And I think if you 
reach--so if you reach out to a couple of the air, advanced 
mobility companies, they will tell you they feel that we are on 
step. It is--this is fairly complex work.
    And we, what we have said and what we continue to say, 
technology can never trump safety. And this is one that the 
public expects and rightfully so, that we get it right. So we 
are moving.
    I can tell you, though, categorically we are moving with a 
strong sense of purpose to enable these new entrants in the 
market. And that is one of the things we are truly passionate 
about.
    Senator Fischer. Will you commit to working with my office, 
keeping us informed on the integration of those technologies?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am. I would be happy to continue to 
give--provide updates.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you. The FAA has completed its 
preliminary investigation on the recent NOTAM malfunction. Will 
a more in-depth investigation and assessment be conducted? And 
will you share those findings with Congress?
    Mr. Nolen. We do have. We will certainly share as much 
information as we are able to. But to your point, and I welcome 
the question, the investigation is ongoing. So a couple of 
things there. We are working our Office of IT and Technology. 
We are working with MITRE to assess all of these systems.
    Again, we are talking thousands. We are looking at levels 
of redundancy. What is our, you know, give us a sort of a 
resiliency score, if you will. So that work is underway. And we 
are thinking in terms from a safety management system 
perspective, what are the controls we have in place?
    If they--did they work? What should have been done? What 
didn't happen? What are the areas and opportunities for us to 
improve?
    Senator Fischer. Have you got in depth on looking at the 
controls and how quickly they were implemented?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am. You know, we have assigned that to a 
couple of our offices, our Office of Safety Investigations, our 
Office of Security to say, again, what happened in the moment. 
It is pretty dynamic.
    A lot of things happen that should have happened in terms 
of reporting. But we certainly look to say, how can we do this 
better to make sure we don't have a repeat.
    Senator Fischer. OK. Thank you very much. Thank you, Madam 
Chair.
    The Chair. Senator Peters. Senator Markey, I had called on 
him, but Senator Peters was ahead of him, and he has been so 
gracious to allow Senator Peters to go. So, thank you, Senator 
Markey. Senator Peters.

                STATEMENT OF HON. GARY PETERS, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN

    Senator Peters. Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you, 
Senator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Nolen, for being here today 
before the Committee.
    You know, like many Americans and Michiganders, I am 
certainly concerned as well by the recent incursions into our 
airspace of a Chinese surveillance balloon, as well as several 
as yet unidentified objects, the most recent one that flew 
across the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and was neutralized over 
Lake Huron.
    I have been in contact with the Department of Defense, the 
Department of Homeland Security, your agency, to monitor these 
currents. And I have called for greater transparency into these 
incidents. So I certainly do appreciate some of your comments 
that you have made here today about FAA's coordination with 
NORAD.
    So I don't want to belabor those points. You have covered 
those well through the hearing so far. But I did want to ask 
you one thing related to that. Earlier this week, the White 
House announced the creation of an interagency team to study 
the broader policy implications for detection, analysis, and 
disposition of unidentified aerial phenomena, and especially 
those that could pose potential security risks.
    So my question for you, does the FAA expect to be a part of 
that team, and has that task force actually met and is starting 
to work?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you for the question, Senator 
Peters. Yes, the FAA is part of that team. Our COO, Tim 
Morrell, will be our representative on their team, and that 
team has already met and continues to meet.
    Senator Peters. Good. Good. You also mentioned to Senator 
Schatz, the FAA currently has people embedded in NORAD to 
improve coordination. But given these specific events, are 
there any additional bureaucratic or inoperability improvements 
that you can share with Congress to ensure that these 
concerning breaches of airspace are basically met with a 
seamless and immediate response?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, what I can tell you in an open forum is 
that there is a whole of Government approach to this from an 
interagency standpoint to make sure not only that we are 
aligned on policy, we are aligned on response, that that level 
of coordination is absolutely there.
    Senator Peters. Good, good. Mr. Nolen, Gerald, our Ford 
International Airport in Grand Rapids in Michigan, is the 
second--Michigan's second largest airport. Over 200 aircraft 
operations per day, and it serves a growing part of the state 
of Michigan.
    However, even as Grand Rapids serves record numbers of 
passengers, it has been stymied in its efforts to expand and 
modernize a 60-year-old FAA air traffic control tower.
    Last year, I secured $5 million in Congressionally directed 
spending for the airport to begin the design process and to 
replace that tower, but it is still not done. And I would just 
like to ask you, would you commit to working with me and the 
Grand Rapids Airport to ensure that a plan to replace their 
tower is done in a timely fashion?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir. What I can commit is, we will 
definitely work with your staff in terms of, I know there is 
work that is ongoing there. We will commit to giving you 
regular updates on it and what our progress is.
    Senator Peters. Right. Well, thank you. The unmanned aerial 
systems are beyond visual line of sight, Aviation Rulemaking 
Committee has published its report in March of 2022. The report 
laid the foundation for providing regulatory certainty to 
stakeholders looking to safely and swiftly deploy and scale 
unmanned aerial systems.
    However, the FAA's rulemaking agenda notes that a draft 
rule for UAS deployment outside the visual line of sight isn't 
expected until February 2024, 23 months from the report to the 
draft rule.
    And that is, as you know, not even a final rule at that 
point. Between the long wait for this rulemaking and difficult 
to navigate current exemption and waiver process, I am afraid 
advancements in commercial drone industry have stalled, 
frustrating communities and states like Michigan, who are 
looking to take advantage of this cutting-edge technology and 
economic opportunity it represents.
    So my question for you, Mr. Nolen, do you commit to doing 
everything you can to ensure that the U.S. maintains its global 
leadership in advanced aviation? And certainly, this type of 
aircraft that represents the future, we need to lean into, 
making sure we are facilitating that.
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you, sir, for the question. Let me 
say, the U.S. is and remains the world's leader when it comes 
to this type of technology. To date, we have licensed over a 
million drones. Our projections are that we will have 2.5 
million by Fiscal Year 2025. So we are working. With respect to 
beyond visual line of sight, we stood up an aviation rulemaking 
arc and a committee.
    We received thousands of reports. We are going--comments, 
if you will. We are going through the process of going through 
those. But in the meantime, even as we are doing that, we have 
things like waivers and exemptions that we are using to enable 
UAS operations, some of which we have already done.
    So we will commit that this is, again, part of our top 
priority for our drones, for advanced air mobility, to make 
sure that we stay the world's leader.
    Senator Peters. Good. Thank you, Mr. Nolen. Senator Markey 
and Chair Cantwell, thank you.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Budd.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED BUDD, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA

    Senator Budd. I thank the Chair. Mr. Nolen, welcome. It was 
good to chat with you earlier. You know, I was listening to a 
colleague from across the aisle a few minutes ago from 
Colorado, and, you know, it struck me how much I appreciated 
your aviation experience, your service to our military.
    You know, it would just make sense, common sense seems not 
so common anymore, but, you know, it would just makes sense 
that somebody leading the Federal Aviation Administration would 
actually have aviation experience, so I appreciate the 
experience that you bring to the table.
    You know, on the morning when this issue occurred, an 
exchange between air traffic control and a pilot at Newark 
Airport sums up some of the broader issues with the NOTAM 
system that go beyond this specific outage. ATC was talking to 
an airplane, that was to a pilot of an airplane that was 
taxiing out for departure and told the pilot about the 
nationwide ground stop.
    ATC asked the pilot if he had heard anything about the 
NOTAM issue before departure. The pilot responded, no, nobody 
reads NOTAMs. Well, maybe that is because the NOTAM system is 
not designed in a user-friendly way.
    The FAA's new Federal NOTAM website, it is a little better, 
but it does not prioritize important NOTAMs, and it delivers it 
in a printed code that is optimized for teletype machines 
instead of plain English. I will give you an example, as you 
would know, so I printed this out.
    No environmental impact study was done before, but I 
printed out the NOTAM from the Federal NOTAM system for a 
flight from D.C. back to my home airport near Winston-Salem. It 
is a 90-page document for a simple flight about an hour long.
    If I didn't review the list closely, I might have missed 
the NOTAM for a runway closure in my designated alternate 
airport. The NOTAM is buried on page four, somewhere in here 
between 13 other runway and taxiway NOTAMs.
    So, Chair, I would like to ask for unanimous consent that 
this briefing be included in the record.
    The Chair. Without objection.
    [The information referred to follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    

    Senator Budd. Thank you. Your pilots can consult other free 
resources provided by the FAA-like Leidos' Flight Service. That 
system does have a summary of important NOTAMs, like temporary 
flight restrictions or TFRs, and runway closures.
    But that system missed the runway closure NOTAM on the 
summary page. Here is the summary page, and it doesn't have 
that important NOTAM.
    So I would have had to find that runway closure NOTAM on 
page 53 of a 276 page briefing. So, Mr. Nolen, aside from the 
issues faced last month, what is the FAA doing to bring NOTAMs 
into the 21st century?
    [The information referred to follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]


    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you, Senator Budd, for the question. 
This is exactly--you know, again, we share that we are both 
pilots, so we operate in the Nation's airspace here. This is 
part of our modernization effort.
    We committed that we will align our NOTAM with the ICAO 
standard. That we will make them timely, we will make them 
relevant, and the ability to prioritize by, as you say, by 
route of flight. So that is a part of the work is ongoing. 
Where we are today, we are--call it half way there. They are 
searchable.
    You can find the ones that are relevant to your flight. But 
this is a one we have just got to do better, and that better 
means getting off of the U.S. NOTAM system, onto the Federal 
NOTAM system, and the last part of that is ensuring now that 
our NOTAM systems comports to the ICAO standard.
    Senator Budd. Thank you very much for that answer. So it 
makes sense to have flight restrictions around major games like 
last week in Super Bowl or, you know, the upcoming Daytona 500. 
And those TFRs are announced well in advance and cover much 
more airspace to provide appropriate security for those special 
events.
    But stadium TFRs and the exception of those TFRs, they seem 
designed to trip up small planes flying VFR. So, Mr. Nolen, are 
you aware of any instances where a 3 mile, 3,000 foot TFR 
thwarted a threat from the air?
    Mr. Nolen. I am not.
    Senator Budd. OK. Well, Mr. Nolen, my time is short, but 
again, I want to just again, thank you for what you bring to 
the table, for your expertise in the aviation field, and your 
leadership of the FAA.
    As a pilot myself, I am glad that a fellow aviator is at 
the helm of this important agency, and I hope that we can get a 
permanent head of the FAA that has a deep understanding of the 
issues facing aviation today. Thank you so much. I yield back.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Markey.

               STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD MARKEY, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS

    Senator Markey. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for your 
service, sir. Obviously, the outage of the NOTAM system just 
shows how fragile our aviation system has become. And we heard 
in testimony last week that Southwest Airlines suffered its own 
operational meltdown due to inadequate amounts of winter 
equipment, which was exacerbated by its own limited 
technological system.
    Southwest told us that they didn't have enough deicing 
equipment in Chicago or in Denver, which is like saying you 
don't have enough baseballs to open the season at Fenway Park. 
You know, so obviously, they didn't anticipate what was 
unfolding. And a lot of it is as a result of climate change, as 
a result of global warming.
    Burlington, Vermont, for example, in a report out just this 
past month, but it is a good example of what is happening 
across the country, is seven degrees warmer in the winter than 
it was just 50 years ago.
    Burlington, Vermont, seven degrees warmer. So it is not 
just global warming, it is global weirding that is taking 
place, and therefore, you have to adjust, adapt the system to 
the craziness of the weather. And the aviation system has to 
make the investment in order to deal with this dramatically 
changing weather environment due to global warming, due to 
climate change.
    So there is a dangerous connection between climate change 
and outdated technology and infrastructure, with extreme 
weather events like winter storm Elliot stressing the IT 
systems at the core of our aviation system. So, Administrator 
Nolen, do you agree that climate change poses new challenges 
for airlines, airports, and the FAA?
    Mr. Nolen. Senator Markey, thank you for the question. Just 
given my long time airline experience, I can say, number one, I 
have operated in all kind of conditions. The airlines, when we 
think about how they operate, they all have what they call 
winter operation plan. I am not an expert on climate. I 
certainly believe there are things we must do to continue as we 
think about what----
    Senator Markey. Do you think you have to become an expert 
on climate? Do you think the aviation system has to become 
expert on climate? What do you think?
    Mr. Nolen. Absolutely. The more we know, the better.
    Senator Markey. So that is what I would like to hear. I 
would like to hear that there is an understanding, 
appreciation, you know. That if you are not an expert, other 
people have to be experts.
    Mr. Nolen. We do have--we do that have that level of 
expertise within the agency.
    Senator Markey. And that, I think, is very important 
because we are going to obviously have to harden our aviation 
systems against extreme storms, heat, and other weather events. 
Do you think that the FAA needs to require a greater investment 
in resiliency at airports?
    Mr. Nolen. That is certainly the path we are on. And so, 
you know, and that is a wonderful way of describing it, right. 
It is how resilient are our systems. And the extent to which we 
build that in and bake that in, certainly the industry globally 
is investing in technology to be more resilient. And it is an 
absolute priority for us.
    Senator Markey. And I am working on legislation to improve 
the resiliency of our aviation system, particularly at our 
airports. We worked hard to include $25 billion for our 
airports in the bipartisan infrastructure law.
    But these critical investments will be wasted if we don't 
address the climate related risks. And we are just going to 
have to work together in order to make sure that they are not 
in denial about what is happening. And just one final point, 
which is related to airport resiliency, which is airport 
service workers.
    These individuals are the unsung heroes of our aviation 
system, but they often are overworked and underpaid. And just 
as our aviation system literally came to a stop due to a NOTAM 
outage, our airports would similarly stop functioning if the 
airport workers, the wheelchair attendants, the concessions 
workers, ramp agents, baggage handlers did not do their jobs.
    So I just think it is absolutely essential that we 
recognize, and you do agree, they are essential to keeping 
these airports functioning?
    Mr. Nolen. I do, indeed.
    Senator Markey. Yes, and I think it is important for us, 
which is why I introduced the Good Jobs for Good Airports Act, 
which would ensure that airport workers are paid a living wage 
and benefits. They are underappreciated, underpaid, under 
supported, they are black, brown, immigrant disproportionately. 
And during the pandemic, they showed up. They couldn't zoom to 
work. And we just have to make sure they get the resources 
which they need. So thank you, sir, for the work that you do.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, sir.
    Senator Markey. Thank you.
    The Chair. Thank you. Before I go to our next member to ask 
questions, I just want to clarify that the video that we saw 
earlier was a simulation done by Senator Cruz, I think, and his 
team. That was not a real video of the incident. There seems to 
be some confusion about that, so.
    Mr. Nolen. No, ma'am. I knew it was a simulation.
    The Chair. Yes, OK. You clearly stated that, but not 
everybody may have captured that, so we just want to reiterate 
that. Next, I have Senator Vance.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. J.D. VANCE, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO

    Senator Vance. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Nolen, thank you 
for being here. I am going to ask just a little bit about some 
of the unusual increases in obsession with the vocabulary and 
language that we are seeing in some of the FAA guidance and 
related documents related to our aviation industry. I want to 
ask, did the FAA issue a 176 page guidance document changing 
notices to airmen to notices of air mission in December 2021?
    Mr. Nolen. We did.
    Senator Vance. This was in part to avoid using the gender 
term airmen, correct?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir, I believe so.
    Senator Vance. OK. On November 10, 2021, the FAA held an 
inclusive language summit. Are you familiar with this effort?
    Mr. Nolen. I am familiar with it.
    Senator Vance. During the summit, which had a solicitation 
published in the Federal Register, Deputy Administrator Mims 
stated that when we use terms like airman or unmanned aircraft, 
so I am laughing because this has to be a joke, we are sending 
a message that only men belong in the aerospace community. Do 
you agree with that statement?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, Senator, what I could say is that having 
been a pilot for 42 years and seeing the evolution of our 
aerospace industry, I started out in helicopters and have flown 
as a captain in big jetliners. Not everyone is a pilot today. 
We have drones. We have spaceships--spacecraft, I am sorry.
    And so I do believe going to notices to air missions is 
absolutely the right thing to do. It is a accurate reflection 
of where airspace system is today. Fully supportive of that. 
And none of that, by the way, detracts from our mission, which 
is the safety of our airspace. And that will always be our 
North Star.
    Senator Vance. The point is, if it makes sense for some 
aviation reason, that is fine. If it makes sense purely to 
avoid gendered language, it seems like an unnecessary 
preoccupation with the words that you are using and that we are 
using rather than the work that we are doing.
    I want to just ask a couple of additional questions about 
this summit. The public notice for the meeting stated, ``if any 
individual employer, contractor, or industry partner feels 
excluded or marginalized because of language or words, the work 
of the agency suffers.'' Do you agree that the feelings of FAA 
employees about language are this important?
    Mr. Nolen. What I agree is that as we seek to attract the 
next generation of people into aerospace, mostly they won't 
look like the people sitting in this room. And so it is our 
ability to say, how do we bring tomorrow into today into an 
industry that is evolving right before our eyes. So our ability 
to find inclusive ways of reaching underrepresented groups is a 
right path to be on.
    Senator Vance. OK. I guess unanimous consent enter into the 
record the Drone Advisory Committee Public E-Book. I have it 
right here. This document uses the term wife as an example of 
the type of language that we need to eliminate. Is that 
something you support?
    Mr. Nolen. I am sorry, could you restate the question? I am 
sorry, sir.
    Senator Vance. So I am asking to give consent, first of 
all, to enter this into the record. But it explains that wife, 
the word wife is an example of the type of language that we 
need to eliminate. And I am just asking if that is something 
you think is necessary or something you support?
    Mr. Nolen. I would have to give that one some more thought.
    Senator Vance. Well, I would hope that the word wife is not 
something that we--or is something that we could all agree is a 
reasonable vocabulary word that most Americans use in their 
daily life. It is not something that we need to eliminate.
    I don't have much time here, so let me just ask here, at 
this same summit, during a panel called, How the FAA is Pushing 
Gendered Language Boundaries, the panelists stated that FAA 
leadership brought us to where we are here today. We see the 
recommendations from the Committee as a foundation, but it is 
also just the beginning of the conversation?
    It strikes me that preoccupying ourselves so much with the 
words that we use rather than the work that we do, especially 
as our infrastructure appears to be crumbling and we have had 
major flight outages in the last couple of years, is at best a 
distraction, and at worst a thing that takes attention away 
from focusing on the real problems.
    I worry--well, I especially I represent the people of Ohio, 
and I am very confident that the majority of Ohioans, if there 
is a pilot who is offended by the word wife or the word 
cockpit, maybe that person shouldn't be a pilot.
    So rather than kowtowing to people who are fragile, maybe 
we should actually say, if you are so worried about the words 
that we are using, you shouldn't be flying, you know, multi-ton 
metal engines through the sky.
    And I just ask all of us to maybe try to focus as much on 
real problems, like the fact that our aviation system seems to 
not be working as well as it used to, than the fact that we may 
use un-inclusive or under inclusive language. Thank you, Mr. 
Nolen. I appreciate it.
    The Chair. Senator Baldwin.

               STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY BALDWIN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN

    Senator Baldwin. Thank you, Madam Chair. So welcome, 
Administrator Nolen. Thank you for coming before the Committee 
and I know you will be back again, although that will not stop 
me from going beyond the stated topic of this hearing. But I am 
going to start with the stated topic of this hearing.
    So the NOTAM failure happened right on the heels of a 
failure with Southwest Airlines. We had Southwest leadership 
testify last week about their meltdown during the holidays. And 
I want to raise a similar concern for the FAA that I raised 
with Southwest.
    When something goes wrong and flights are canceled or 
delayed to the degree that they were during both of these 
situations, airports need to hear from you. They need to hear, 
in the case of Southwest, from Southwest, I learned from 
several Wisconsin airports, they just did not receive any type 
of proactive communication from the agency about the impacts of 
the NOTAM failure.
    They only received information necessary to respond to 
confused and frustrated travelers after reaching out, you know, 
themselves to FAA's local regional office. It is my expectation 
in situations like these that FAA should provide proactive and 
real time updates and guidance to our Nation's airports.
    Can you commit to that moving forward, and tell me how you 
would approach that, should we ever have a failure like this or 
similar disruption that requires this type of communication?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, Senator Baldwin, thank you so much for the 
question there. Let me say, just to set the record straight, 
throughout the course of every day, there are industry calls 
from our National Command Center every 2 hours.
    In addition, on the January 10th, we also opened up a 
hotline at 8 p.m. on the night of January 10th, and we had 
anyone could call into that, meaning airlines, airports, and 
other users of the system.
    So that was open. And then we were talking with our 
industry stakeholders throughout the night. On the following 
morning, when I instituted the ground stop, that information 
also went out nationwide to all airports. And we have roughly 
5,000 airports in the country.
    And so all of that, and as well, our office of airports 
also reached out to provide updates on the NOTAM outages that 
morning, early that morning of January 11th. And certainly we 
also updated that once the NOTAM was canceled. But your point 
is well taken.
    We will go back and just scrub to say, can we even improve 
our communication process, and we will commit to you that we 
will do just that.
    Senator Baldwin. I appreciate that. Congress took action in 
the last FAA reauthorization or the 2018 FAA reauthorization to 
move airports away from firefighting foams that contain PFAS, 
yet airports are still without any approved alternatives. 
Airports in my state are eager to transition away toward safer 
alternatives and are anxiously awaiting an approved alternative 
from the FAA.
    I will note that there are now numerous communities in 
Wisconsin whose groundwater has been contaminated with PFAS, 
and they are, in many cases, immediately adjacent to an 
operating airport.
    I am aware that the Department of Defense, which has a 
strong role to play here, of course, recently released a 
military specification outlining its requirement for 
firefighting foams that do not contain PFAS.
    So given that update, what can you tell me and what do you 
see as the likely timeline for finally giving airports PFAS-
free alternatives? And how does the agency see its role in 
assisting airports throughout this transition process that we 
hope will be forthcoming?
    Mr. Nolen. Good question there. We are still working 
through that. So our Associate Administrator for Airports is on 
point in terms of working through this issue with PFAS. We 
recognize is one of supply as we look to an alternative.
    As you mentioned, the new mil-spec is out. Airports are 
allowed to use for an actual emergency, and then we have got 
procedures where they can test without discharging PFAS onto 
the ramp and, you know, keeping that from getting into the 
water tables.
    So we are working through the process of how we get there. 
We recognize it will take us some time. What I can commit to 
you is, we will follow up with you, with your staff in terms of 
what that those actual timelines are as they become available 
to us.
    Senator Baldwin. I just would want to stress and press for 
all due but considered speed on this. The resources that we are 
committing at the Federal level to try to assist communities 
with getting a clean and safe water supply after contamination 
are in the billions, and we shouldn't be prolonging this in any 
way.
    So I certainly want to press for, you know, timely action 
on this. I know at the local fire department's--fire department 
level, which obviously is different than aviation firefighting, 
but they are finding various firefighting foams that are 
working very effectively that do not contain PFAS.
    It seems to me that those tests--that that testing can be 
happening at the Federal level and get something in the queue 
as soon as possible.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Baldwin. Senator Schmitt.

                STATEMENT OF HON. ERIC SCHMITT, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI

    Senator Schmitt. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a couple of 
questions. And you may have addressed this already, but I do 
want to ask because I get a lot of questions about this from 
back home.
    So you were aware of this the night before on the NOTAM 
failure in January, but the public was not made aware until the 
next morning, right, including when people were sitting on 
planes and flights were delayed? I mean, there was no real 
transparency with the public, you would agree with that?
    Mr. Nolen. What I would agree with, sir, is that we, the 
system on the night before was operating, and also airlines 
were not reporting that there were any operational impacts on 
the night of the 10th.
    Senator Schmitt. OK. So how long until you knew that this 
actually wasn't working, until the public knew?
    [Technical problems.]
    The Chair. I think that was one of our colleagues trying 
to--next in line------
    Senator Schmitt. That is OK. Can I have my 10 seconds back?
    The Chair. Yes, sure.
    Senator Schmitt. I am just kidding.
    [Laughter.].
    Senator Schmitt. Right. OK, I just want to move on to 
something else. So in the President's budget that has been 
submitted, there is $2.4 million proposed to address climate 
change.
    In the conclusion of that budget, it says, and I quote, 
``the FAA's budget request for Fiscal Year 2023 embodies the 
Administration's priorities of mitigating climate change and 
increasing equity.''
    Do you believe that that is your mission at the FAA, to 
mitigate climate change and increase equity? Is that your job 
at the FAA?
    Mr. Nolen. I believe it is all of our jobs here to address 
climate change, and is one that we take seriously.
    Senator Schmitt. OK. In that report, there is further 
commentary about it as a response to the accelerating climate 
crisis. Do you believe we have a climate crisis?
    Mr. Nolen. I was just at the ICAO convention where the 
majority in an overwhelming fashion supported moving to net 
zero carbon emissions by 2050. So if you look out across the 
global community, it is one that is staring us in the face and 
it is one we must address.
    Senator Schmitt. I am not really interested in the global 
community's view. I am interested in the FAA's view, whose 
mission is supposed to be safe and affordable travel for the 
American public.
    And what I have noticed with agencies, and this was 
particularly heightened in COVID and I think is now the 
playbook, we went from global warming to climate change to now 
a climate crisis. And as you have indicated, words matter. And 
in my view, that is meant to stoke fear and empower unelected 
bureaucrats to do things that are not authorized by law because 
it is an ``emergency.''
    And so I have deep concerns with spending $2.4 million on--
it is not really clear, but I want to read you something from 
this. It says the FAA, this is the same budget request, the FAA 
will need to continue supporting maintenance and implementation 
of ICAO's Carbon Offsetting And Reduction Scheme for 
International Aviation, CORSIA, the international standard.
    CORSIA is a market based measure that allows international 
operators to achieve carbon neutral growth through the use of 
carbon offsets and sustainable aviation fuel. Is the FAA 
currently supportive of CORSIA?
    Mr. Nolen. Of course, Yes, sir, we are. And we are 
supportive of our move to sustainable aviation fuels.
    Senator Schmitt. OK. I am distressed and troubled that the 
Secretary Buttigieg, Pete Buttigieg, is not here today. Do you 
know if Pete Buttigieg, when he flies private, uses that same 
system, that same measurement of CORSIA?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, first, let me say, sir, that what you 
speak of is private Government aircraft that are used across 
the Government. We use aircraft for testing. The FAA has a 
fleet of 42 aircraft that are primarily used for en route 
testing, et cetera. And so in those, without having to sort of 
qualify this, we are talking about public resources and not 
private resources.
    Senator Schmitt. Right. Does he, does the Secretary use 
market based carbon offsets when he flies private?
    Mr. Nolen. Sir, I can't speak to that.
    Senator Schmitt. Can you get back to me on that, because I 
am very interested. Or maybe actually, if you could get the 
message to the Secretary the next time we have a hearing 
dealing with the Department of Transportation, the FAA, we 
would like to see him here. And if he could give an answer to 
that.
    Because he flies private a lot. He tells hardworking 
Americans they need to pay more for things that he is not 
willing to pay for, and people are frustrated. Could you relay 
that message to him?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir.
    Senator Schmitt. Thank you.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Duckworth.

              STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY DUCKWORTH, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ILLINOIS

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Madam Chair. As a Senator 
from the great state of Illinois where we produce a lot of 
ethanol, my farmers are very supportive of the aviation fuel, 
sustainable aviation fuel movement.
    As a pilot, and we both actually started off as rotor 
heads, so welcome. It is good to see a fellow the rotor head. 
And I know your background in aviation actually also includes a 
long history of aviation safety.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Duckworth. All the way back to your days as an Army 
pilot. One of the things that you learn is that a safety system 
should never be left vulnerable to a single point of failure, 
never.
    Redundancy saves lives. We know that. That is why I am very 
alarmed that a single contractor could crash the automated 
NOTAM system by simply deleting files. That sounds like a 
single point of failure to me and I would love to understand it 
better.
    And this is on the heels of the deadly Boeing 737 MAX 
crashes that were caused by the grossly irresponsible decision 
to place passengers' lives at risk at the mercy of a single 
angle of attack sensor.
    What is striking about these incidents is that America's 
largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, and the world's most 
important aviation regulator, both betrayed a fundamental 
aviation safety principle, operational redundancy.
    It is the FAA's job to keep our airspace safe, but it is 
impossible for FAA to do this unless its systems have 
appropriate redundancies, and you generally have redundancies 
across the system.
    Administrator Nolen, when was the last time that the FAA 
reviewed its air traffic organization's facilities and 
equipment to ensure that there are no potential single points 
of failure?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you, Senator Duckworth. And I 
applaud you for your service as well. It is great to talk to a 
fellow Army person. Let me just say, we have an ongoing look in 
terms of where we are.
    So the whole journey of modernization for the FAA is 
exactly to what you are describing, how do we continue to build 
in redundancy and resiliency in the system, and expand it to be 
able to accommodate new entrants in what we have today? That 
work is ongoing.
    Senator Duckworth. When was the last time before the NOTAM 
system crashed that a review was conducted?
    Mr. Nolen. We did reviews in 2020, 2021, and we have done 
three reviews in 2022.
    Senator Duckworth. I would love to see any report from 
those reviews, if possible.
    Mr. Nolen. We will certainly follow up with them.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. The Boeing 737 MAX 
investigation discovered that at least one employee 
specifically cautioned against relying on a single angle of 
attack sensor in the airframe, but that concern went unheeded. 
How often, if ever, are you briefed on concerns that FAA 
employees may have about the resiliency of the air traffic 
organization's facilities and equipment? Do you get those 
briefings? Do those come up to you at your level?
    Mr. Nolen. We do. We have several processes. Certainly, we 
have a whistleblower program. We have got a for our safety 
organization. We have a voluntary safety confidential reporting 
program.
    So there are multiple avenues for FAA employees to get 
information to me. I have a biweekly with my audit team in 
terms of----
    Senator Duckworth. And they lift up individual?
    Mr. Nolen. They do come to me for individual reports.
    Senator Duckworth. OK. I am going to go to my next question 
just simply because I have a limited amount of time. As you 
know, last week, Airlines for America urged FAA to extend its 
proposed deadline to June 2024 to retrofit aircraft with 
altimeters that won't experience interference from 5G wireless 
technology.
    While a 4-month delay may not be a huge disruption, it is a 
reminder that this process has been and remains a seat of the 
pants operation. Had the FAA and FCC better cooperated during 
the development of 5G, wireless customers would have benefited 
from a smooth, predictable rollout of this new technology 
without risks to air passengers.
    Instead, we were treated to delays, negotiations, and 
uncertainty, all because the FAA and the FCC failed to 
meaningfully collaborate with each other early and often over 
the years. We should never have reached a situation where the 
FAA had to seriously consider halting flights at certain 
airports because it could not rule out the risk of 5G 
interference causing a crash, even if such a risk was low.
    I have several questions I think I am going to ask you--I 
am going to submit for the record. But really, you know, what I 
need to know is, is the FAA receiving all the technical 
information it needs from the FCC and the wireless carriers to 
ensure that 5G does not interfere?
    Does the FAA have the resources that it needs to ensure 
that all passenger aircraft are equipped with the technology to 
prevent 5G from interfering with flight operations? And this is 
both commercial but also general aviation.
    Is the FAA sharing all relevant information with FCC and 
air carriers to prevent 5G from interfering with flight 
operations? So I have a series of questions I am going to 
submit for the record, and I will ask for you to please submit 
your answers in writing.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you. I would be happy to respond.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Capito.

            STATEMENT OF HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

    Senator Capito. Thank you, and welcome, Mr. Nolen. Thank 
you for your service, and long years of service. Let me ask 
just a quick question. Is your--is the FAA workforce in the 
office 5 days a week now?
    Mr. Nolen. No, ma'am, they are not.
    Senator Capito. Do you know how that breaks out? 20 percent 
are?
    Mr. Nolen. I don't have the numbers. I would be happy to 
follow up with you on that. But we do have, we have got folks 
who are in the office and there is coverage every day. Let me 
qualify that. Our operational people are indeed in the office 
every day or, you know, in their control rooms every day.
    Senator Capito. Do you anticipate the rest of the workforce 
will come back every day?
    Mr. Nolen. We are working through, I believe, across all of 
Government to, say, as we come out of the back side of the 
pandemic to make sure that we have got that tempo. What I want 
to make sure for the American public is that the what the work 
we do is accomplished no matter where the person is sitting.
    Senator Capito. Understood. Yes. I would hope everybody 
would eventually get back there. As you know, and I think this 
was addressed, Senators Klobuchar and Moran and I have 
introduced the Note of Improvement Act, S. 66, I think you have 
addressed this, establishing a task force of experts to come up 
with recommendations to make the important pilot notification 
system better.
    While I know you have been trying to improve the system for 
years, can you tell us the benefits of having this legislation 
and assembling these experts with a clear list of objectives 
and deadlines to give recommendations? Could you address that?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you. What I can say about that is we 
support the goals of this legislation, and we are working in 
that level. We are working with industry, stakeholders, we work 
with an earlier group as we started the journey of modernizing 
our NOTAM system.
    Senator Capito. Do you think that having that stronger 
NOTAM system would cut down on this 1,732 runway incursions we 
saw in 2022?
    Mr. Nolen. I certainly think getting to that advanced 
system, prioritizing all the things that we have talked about 
here this morning, will make the system more resilient. And so, 
I would love to see us get there quicker.
    Senator Capito. Let me ask you this about contractors. We 
have noticed, and you have you noted, cybersecurity are a major 
issue. And we are also concerned that as Senator Duckworth was 
talking about, the contractor unintentionally deleting files, 
causing the outage.
    And on January the 11th, you say to that new protocol 
requires more than one person to be present when database work 
occurs. Can you tell us how many contracts or have contractors 
have access to the NOTAM system? And does the other person that 
needs to be present? Is that an FAA person or is it--could they 
be a contractor?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am. So let me say firstly, for the 
contractors that were directly involved in the unintentional 
deletion, they no longer have access to either FAA facilities 
or the NOTAM system. So we do have other contractors. I don't 
have the exact number in front of me, but would be happy to 
follow up there. And we also have a level of FAA oversight. And 
so part of that----
    Senator Capito. So it could be either/ or?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am. No, there will always--there is 
always FAA oversight.
    Senator Capito. OK. OK. I was going to ask you a question 
about 5G. We have had hearings in this committee on the issues 
between the FAA and the FCC. And I note Senator Duckworth 
introduced some questions for the record, but what is your 
communications strategy with the FCC on this so we don't run up 
against another deadline, and have another hearing, and then 
everything seems to break down?
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you for the question. We are working very 
closely with the FCC and the NTIA, as well as the industry on 
all things 5G. We have got a regular cadence of meetings with 
the FCC on this, and we are in a position where we have better 
alignment and we have got an absolute sense of transparency 
going there.
    Senator Capito. Well, I would encourage that. Let me ask 
you a question coming from a rural state with smaller airports. 
What would you say the biggest challenge moving forward the 
next 10 to 20 years is going to be for our smaller regional 
airports?
    Mr. Nolen. What gives me, you know, a lot of hope is as we 
start to see advanced air mobility, I mean, it really excites 
me. And that ability to not only go between cities, but to 
connect smaller cities as well.
    When we think about urban air taxis and what the 
possibilities are there, I think is fascinating, to be quite 
honest. We continue to look at how, you know, what is that 
level of support. I can't speak to the economics of it.
    That is not my, within my purview. But we are a strong 
supporter of our system. We look for ways how do we support 
certainly from a Federal Aviation Administration.
    Senator Capito. Thank you. And I would like to just thank 
you and your representatives that are in West Virginia. We have 
a lot of contact with them. We have some--you have probably 
flown into West Virginia.
    Mr. Nolen. I have.
    Senator Capito. It takes a little bit of skill, I think. 
And in some cases a lot of skill. So they are very responsive 
to us and reply and help us in a short period of time. So I 
please convey my appreciation.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes's, ma'am. Thank you for the feedback. We 
will certainly pass it on.
    Senator Capito. Thank you.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you.
    Senator Capito. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The Chair. Thank you so much. So my intention is to ask a 
follow up question, and if anybody else shows up, we will give 
them an opportunity to ask a question. If they don't, we are 
going to close out the hearing and move on.
    But, Mr. Nolen, I found it very concerning that the same 
day we had this NOTAM system issue, so did Canada. I just feel 
like this can't be a coincidence, that we have no incidents, 
and then on the same day, the same system has a problem in two 
different countries. Do you know about the Canadian outage, and 
what is your make of this situation?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am. I do know about the Canadian outage. 
We have talked with our counterparts at NAV, Canada. 
Absolutely, there was no connection between what they 
experienced based on everything they told us and what we 
experienced.
    That being said, one of the very first things I directed 
our investigation teams to do, to look at this from both a 
human error, but also from a cyber. We also had the Department 
of Homeland Security working with us to--what is our level of 
cyber resilience there. So, again, the investigation is 
ongoing.
    Everything we have to date showed no sign of this being 
cyber related, but the investigation still continues there.
    The Chair. And so what is--what was the outage in Canada? 
What was the----
    Mr. Nolen. There was in a--my understanding from them, 
theirs was a database, but they have a different system, 
different architecture. It was not related to our system in any 
way, shape, or form.
    The Chair. I am sure it wasn't related to our system, but I 
still find it ironic that two, you know, of the biggest systems 
in the world are outed at the same time. And there has been no 
problems with these NOTAM systems, and all of a sudden, on the 
same day, there was a problem.
    Just I think we will look forward to more data and 
information from you on that. Back to the question, though, on 
redundancy. I don't think we have true redundancy here. So I 
want to see a plan from the FAA that examines the fact that the 
backup systems are still subject to the same kind of, if you 
want to call it human error, of deletion of files.
    You are building a system to try to firewall that from not 
happening again, but it could be a different problem, and we 
still have a backup system that would be affected.
    So until we get the true modernization system, I would like 
you to go back and see what level of redundancy that you really 
have a truly separate system that would not be impacted by 
this.
    Mr. Nolen. We appreciate the concern, and that is indeed 
one of the first paths I directed as well, is to this 
overarching look by our IT team working with MITRE is to do 
exactly what you are asking for.
    The Chair. And so, what did you come up with since you went 
down this road sooner than I did? What did you come up with?
    Mr. Nolen. That is still ongoing. They have got still a bit 
to do because, you know, as I said, we have got thousands of 
systems, and so our ask for them is to once that work is done, 
we will certainly be happy to provide an update to the 
Committee.
    The Chair. You mean we have contractors with too much stuff 
and they can't get things done, is that what you are saying?
    Mr. Nolen. No, ma'am.
    The Chair. Oh, OK. So why can't they give us an analysis of 
the system and keeping a duplicate system.
    Mr. Nolen. That's the body of work that is ongoing. It is 
not just the NOTAM system, but I think what you are asking for 
is looking across all of our critical systems that underpin our 
national airspace and the levels of redundancy there. That is 
the work that we have, our IT and MITRE.
    The Chair. No, I am asking just now. Not the NOTAM system. 
I want to get an answer within a week about the NOTAM system 
having a separate backup, totally separate backup, that could 
be used.
    You are saying what happened here is somebody infected the 
file and basically ended up deleting something that then caused 
the outage to the system. So, the question is, you are now 
trying to put human redundancy there so that this won't happen 
again.
    But if the same system is a network, including the backup 
to servers and other places, and whatever action somebody 
mistakenly takes on files still affects the whole system, what 
would be important to understand is can the FAA set up a true 
redundant server system that would allow for that file 
corruption that happened not to happen across the entire 
system? And that is what we need to know the answer to.
    So, I do see you a few colleagues have arrived, which means 
we have some questions to answer. So, I am going to go and vote 
and I will turn it over to my colleague from Wyoming, Ms. 
Lummis, and then my colleague from Georgia, Mr. Warnock, and 
then we will see who else shows up. But thank you very much.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, ma'am.
    The Chair. Senator Lummis.

               STATEMENT OF HON. CYNTHIA LUMMIS, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING

    Senator Lummis. Thank you, Chairman Cantwell. This is an 
important hearing. We appreciate your being here very much. 
Looking forward to your testimony today and your willingness to 
serve and continuing this important dialog. Before I go to my 
questions, I want to highlight several issues that I believe 
should be at the top of this committee's priority list as we 
look to reauthorize the FAA.
    Obviously, there is no doubt that both the Southwest and 
the NOTAM system failures have shown the need for a reliable 
air service ecosystem, both in the public and the private 
sector. But I must note that reliability of air service is an 
issue that my home state of Wyoming faces every day, whether 
there is a system outage or not.
    Factors such as a lack of pilots, high jet fuel prices, a 
consolidation of air carriers, and the up gauging of aircraft 
capacity have left many rural communities across the country at 
risk of losing their air service.
    So, as we move into this FAA reauthorization, this 
committee must not lose sight of the main goal of our national 
aviation policy, creating a truly national network that safely 
connects all regions together.
    So, I am looking forward to the discussions today. Acting 
Administrator Nolen, it is my understanding that many in the 
aviation industry feel that NOTAM system does not provide 
useful information. I happened to be sitting on an airplane 
when NOTAM went down and the pilot was trying to explain to us 
what NOTAM does.
    Often air crews are bombarded with information, some of 
which is critical, while others are repetitive or even 
irrelevant for the specific route the aircraft will be flying.
    As the FAA looks to recover from this outage and modernize 
the IT infrastructure, I am curious to hear if the FAA has 
heard similar concerns, and if there are plans to 
simultaneously modernize NOTAM so that it can better prioritize 
the information it is sending to air crews?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am. Thank you for the question. What I 
would say--so, two things. Number one, the journey that we are 
on, and we are about halfway through it in terms of our 
modernization of the NOTAM system, is designed to do exactly 
what you are describing and what the general concern is, how do 
we ensure that the NOTAMs deliver to pilots? Being a pilot 
myself, are relevant, they are timely, they are prioritized, 
and they speak to the route of flight.
    Now, there are times when you may have to divert, so we 
can't always say they are irrelevant. And, you know, if you are 
deviating around the weather system sometime, that could take 
you hundreds of miles off your present course. And there might 
be a relevant NOTAM there.
    But we are moving. We have already got some functionality 
built into the system today, especially on the Federal NOTAM 
system. And by the time we get to 2025, when we will have 
everybody onto the Federal NOTAM system, we will continue to 
improve that. And following that, we will ultimately get to an 
ICAO standard.
    All of that takes time, of course, but we are working 
through it very purposefully.
    Senator Lummis. So how would it work if it's a more 
localized issue? For example, I have been on planes in Wyoming 
where there were antelope on the runway or a coyote on the 
runway. So, it only affects a few planes in a very localized 
area. Can NOTAM be calibrated to address those sort of very 
isolated individual issues?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, so maybe to speak a little bit about 
NOTAMs, right. So, for your flight that you are on departure, 
yes, you have got NOTAM's that are appended to the flight plan 
if you are on a commercial flight.
    But the other thing you do as a pilot is you would call for 
DH's automatic thermal information, which gives you weather, 
which gives you taxiway closures, which gives you other things 
relevant that may not be working in the moment. In the same 
thing for your route of flight and the same thing for your 
destination airport.
    Pilots, you would call prior to the top of the descent and 
say what is happening at my airport? It may say it is in Booz 
or in Montana, or it is in, you know, Jackson Hole, Wyoming. 
Those are the ``in the moment'' types of information, relevant 
information you would get from the airport itself.
    Our goal is to, again, to continue down this journey of 
streamlining the NOTAM system, making it ICAO compliant, and 
getting it to a point where it is indeed relevant to each route 
of flight.
    Senator Lummis. So recently you announced that upgrades to 
the NOTAM system would not be completed for almost a decade. 
And I assume it is because of the complexity of making the 
updates. But is there a way to expedite that timeframe?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, that is one of the directions I have given 
my team, is come back to me with what it would take resources 
wise for us to accelerate. And we would love this to see if 
that is possible.
    Right now, we substantially, the bulk of the work will be 
done by Fiscal Year 25. I would like to see if we could bring 
that forward, and then there are some other pieces that work 
into that.
    Senator Lummis. One more quick question. I understand the 
FAA has taken steps to prevent another NOTAM malfunction, such 
as decoupling the system and requiring that two people be 
presented when performing work on the system or be present.
    Since the issue with NOTAM was caused by contractors 
accidentally deleting critical code, does the FAA plan to 
restrict access to the NOTAM system moving forward to FAA 
employees?
    Mr. Nolen. No, ma'am, we do not. So, we have a NOTAM system 
that is overseen by the FAA and maintained by contractors. 
These folks are indeed the experts there. What I have ensured 
that we have is the level of oversight for the FAA team, and 
that the requisite level of leadership that oversees that.
    Senator Lummis. Thank you very much, Acting Director Nolen. 
We appreciate your being here. I yield to the gentleman from 
Georgia, Senator Warnock.
    Senator Warnock. Far be it for me to go ahead of the 
gentlewoman from Nevada.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JACKY ROSEN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Rosen. Thank you, Senator Warnock. [Technical 
problems]--and thank you for being here today for this really 
important hearing. I am just going to go quickly right into it, 
because for Nevada, of course, you know, big tourism 
destinations all up and down our state, robust, safe, and 
reliable air travel, it is, like I said, essential for our 
tourism driven economy to thrive.
    In 2022, passenger volume at Harry Reid International 
Airport, it broke an all-time record. The airport welcomed more 
than 52.6 million passengers. And while business travel, of 
course, still recovering in 2022, leisure travel to Las Vegas 
exceeded expectations with visitors drawn to our newly expanded 
sports offerings, I am just saying Super Bowl next year, Las 
Vegas, and other large scale entertainment events.
    And the NOTAM system's outage last month, it did make clear 
to actually all Americans how dependent the world's largest 
economy is on air travel and how dependent air travel is on 
antiquated computer systems.
    Fortunately for our Harry Reid International Airport, the 
immediate impacts of the outage were manageable as we have 
amazing and dedicated employees, and the NOTAM outage happened 
on a Wednesday, which is actually one of our lighter travel 
days. I worry, however, about this happening again and our 
ability as a nation to deal with it.
    So, I want to talk about preparing for a cyber-attack. The 
incidents spanning January 10th and 11th was determined not to 
be a result of a cyber-attack, but it did publicly really 
reveal critical vulnerabilities like some of the other Senators 
have mentioned, in our security and our system architecture, 
and we just have to continue raising these concerns.
    So, do you feel in your estimation, that the FAA systems, 
that they are resilient enough to detect, to counter, and 
defeat a major cyberattack, including by other nation states? 
And does the FAA, do you have the proper infrastructure, and 
most importantly, the properly trained cyber workforce to 
swiftly support that effort?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, we do. So, thank you for the question, 
Senator Rosen. We have a very capable cyber resilience staff. 
We undertake biannual cyber response plan, when we practice 
that plan on a biannual basis.
    We work in close concert in coordination with our other 
agencies, TSA, Homeland Security, et cetera, and we continue 
it. And certainly, the work of modernizing the FAA, which is--
--
    Senator Rosen. I was going to ask, what investments are you 
planning for? What can we expect to see in the coming months to 
maintain this level?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, certainly we want to get on to the Federal 
NOTAM system. That has increased levels of redundancy versus 
the U.S. NOTAM system, but we still got some critical users who 
are using the U.S. NOTAM system.
    So that is the work that will take us to get there. But 
back to the question of cyber resilience. We are. We look 
forward to that. And we think the controls we have in place 
will prevent a repeat of the event that happened on January 11.
    Senator Rosen. And thank you for that. And I want to ask, 
as we move forward into IT modernization, not just in this 
area, but in really every area, we have to do that, how are you 
working with other Federal agencies to manage and prevent 
cyberthreats? And is there something that we can do? Any 
Congressional support you need in order to be sure that those 
collaborations are taking place?
    Mr. Nolen. I would say at a high level, I know the 
Committee has been briefed on many things in and around cyber. 
Currently, well, it has been a while, but we have a whole of 
Government approach to that.
    So, we are working across every agency and every department 
within the Government, around cyber, around cyber resilience. 
That there is that level of interconnectivity is absolutely 
there, and it is one of our top priorities, one of the top 
priorities for the Administration.
    Senator Rosen. And I want to build on that a little bit 
because we know that we are using telephones as a backup, 
right. And so, like the outage again in January, the flight 
crews, they utilized this backup phone system.
    Now, I would say that is--I love my phone and but I would 
say that that is not the best use of our technology. And so, 
considering the added time requirement, the potential for 
error, and inherent in using outdated rudimentary system, is it 
sufficient that a phone is the reliable backup in 2023 to the 
NOTAM system? And what can we do to have a more reliable 
backup?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, a phone is--there are multiple streams of 
getting NOTAMs. One is by calling, one is talking to air 
traffic control, one is talking to the facilities that you may 
be going to or are en route. So that backup that is there, our 
goal is indeed to have a system that is highly resilient and 
redundant, and that is the piece that we are working toward.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. I think I yield to--let me yield 
to Senator Sullivan from Alaska.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DAN SULLIVAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Sullivan. Thank you, Madam Chair. And, Mr. Nolen, 
thank you for being here. You know, my state has very unique 
problems and challenges, 258 communities with no roads, think 
about that, 82 percent of the communities in my state you can't 
get to by a road, so you need an airplane.
    And yet we have the oldest infrastructure and technology of 
any state in the country when it comes to FAA issues. We have 
remote mountainous terrain. We know it presents technical 
challenges for the FAA in installing and maintaining robust 
communications and navigation and satellite systems.
    In the FAA's own words in 2021, the FAA, Alaska Aviation 
Safety Initiative, they said, ``maintaining the extensive 
Alaska national airspace infrastructure, which consists of a 
mixture of old and new components, is a daunting task for FAA 
engineers and technicians.''
    Now, I know we are focused on modernizing the NOTAM system, 
but can I ask you, will the FAA--would the FAA, recognizing the 
huge needs in Alaska, with this Alaska Aviation Initiative, 
which we appreciate from the FAA, are any of these going to be 
addressed in the effort to modernize the NOTAM system?
    Mr. Nolen. Senator Sullivan, thank you so much for the 
question. Yes, indeed. We recognize the criticality of our 
systems with respect to Alaska and all of the challenges that 
you spoke to.
    And Alaska is still one of the areas that remain on the 
U.S. NOTAM system. So that is a part of our goal as well. When 
you think about Alaska international operator, or some parts of 
the DOD, is to get everybody onto the Federal NOTAM system. 
And, you know, that will happen by 2025 unless we can 
accelerate it, and we are looking at what that might take.
    Senator Sullivan. OK. Well, this effort then will result in 
more timely NOTAMs, outages of navigational aids and 
communications. So, will you be able to be able to surge that 
capacity that we need there?
    Mr. Nolen. That is our expectation that we will have, you 
know, better stream, better reliability there.
    Senator Sullivan. Let me ask more specifically, what is the 
FAA focused on in terms of doing soon to address the challenges 
to maintain navigational aids and communications equipment in 
Alaska and then upgrade it?
    Mr. Nolen. We are still working through that. I mean, there 
are things we are doing like around runways, around approaches. 
We have done a lot in terms of GPS approaches. We have got some 
you know, some other approaches, other approaches that we are 
doing in Alaska.
    So, our commitment there is high and everything that we are 
doing, the FAASI, is working and we are making the kind of 
progress.
    Senator Sullivan. OK. Again, I appreciate the FAASI effort. 
I mentioned, 350 communities. All this technology I also 
mentioned, unfortunately, you know, highest death rate per 
capita in terms of flying for all these reasons. Can the FAA, 
and this is a simple idea, store more spare parts in the state 
and provide more technicians?
    Mr. Nolen. Well thank you for the idea, sir. Let me, if you 
allow me to take that back to our team, and we are certainly 
happy to follow up.
    Senator Sullivan. OK, good. Let me ask one final question. 
I know we have a vote here. I want to be respectful to my 
colleague, Senator Warnock. The FAA has a policy that we are 
kind of baffled by right now that is requiring--and to be 
honest, I still don't even really understand it.
    A shorter runways throughout the state of Alaska. That is 
antithetical to what we need right now, which is actually 
longer runways. Remember these communities, the airport is 
off--is the only thing that connects them to, unless you are on 
a river and then it is a boat.
    But the river is frozen in the winter, so why are we 
requiring, in order to be eligible to reconstruct runways using 
Federal funds, that the FAA is forcing Alaska to shorten the 
length of its runways?
    To be honest, you should be helping us lengthen runways. 
This is baffling to me. And my team has tried to explain it to 
me and I don't understand. So, what is happening? This is nuts.
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you, sir, for the question. Let me 
just caveat, correct a couple of things here. There is a caveat 
in the AIP funding that, you know, that requires--when we talk 
about an additional 500 feet is what we are talking about. We 
are working through in Noatak, if I have got that right, 
Alaska.
    Senator Sullivan. Yes.
    Mr. Nolen. So that work is in progress. There is--it is 
also caveated that if it provides critical services----
    Senator Sullivan. Or how about there is no road to that----
    Mr. Nolen. Exactly. So those are things that play into 
that. So that piece is underway.
    Senator Sullivan. Well, I would like to work with you and 
your team with my team to make sure we are not--we are not 
telling Alaskan communities they have got to shorten the runway 
when it is their only lifeline to the rest of the state in the 
rest of the world. OK, thank you.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, sir.

              STATEMENT OF HON. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA

    Senator Warnock. Thank you so very much, Administrator 
Nolen, for being here. Families rely on the FAA to ensure their 
flights will take off safely and efficiently. The FAA's NOTAM 
system plays a critical role in this effort, and its recent 
outage is concerning, to say the least, as me and my colleagues 
have already said, and unacceptable.
    I think you know that. It doesn't just hurt passengers, it 
also poses a national security risk, signaling to our 
adversaries that even a minor computer error can bring down 
domestic commercial flights for hours.
    According to your testimony, this outage resulted from a 
contractor accidentally deleting files that were necessary to 
maintain the synchronization between the live and backup NOTAM 
data bases.
    Administrator Nolen, as of January 10th--and if you can 
answer yes or no, I have got to go and vote. They are always 
doing multiple things around here. We are always doing multiple 
things, I should say. Did FAA staff understand that deleting 
these files could cause this outage as of January 10?
    Mr. Nolen. There was an understanding. If the question is, 
did they understand the result of deleting files, yes, the 
Administrator knew that it was an unintentional deletion. And 
so, as they were working to repair that error, they did 
understand the magnitude of what they had done.
    Senator Warnock. How many contractors had security 
permission to access and delete those files that day?
    Mr. Nolen. On that day, the contractors all had--just let 
me say that our NOTAM system is overseen by the FAA and 
maintained by contractors. They were our database 
administrators, so they had access. The ones directly involved 
in this event on January 10 and 11 no longer have access to our 
system while the investigation is underway. And we are taking a 
look at that.
    Senator Warnock. So how many had access that day?
    Mr. Nolen. That day, I don't have an exact number at the 
moment. That day there were two people working in the system.
    Senator Warnock. So, can you follow up with me and answer 
it in writing?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir.
    Senator Warnock. How many contractors had access that day? 
How many contractors still can disrupt the database connection?
    Mr. Nolen. If you think about it, whether it is a 
contractor or an FAA employee, our goal is to build in a level 
of resilience no matter who is in the system. And we have put 
controls in place to make sure that we have the levels of 
redundancy with oversight, ensuring that two people or more, at 
least two people are there when working on the live data base.
    Senator Warnock. So, you are saying the answer zero now?
    Mr. Nolen. That the answer is zero? I am sorry----
    Senator Warnock. The question was how many contractors 
still can disrupt the database connection? And you are saying 
to me that based on systems you have put in place now with 
redundancies, that answer is now zero?
    Mr. Nolen. You would expect, that is right, with oversight. 
We would not expect to see a repeat of this kind of error.
    Senator Warnock. So, and thank you, if you would follow up 
with the first--the answer to the first question in writing. I 
believe it is essential that FAA award single points of 
failure, which I think I am hearing you say that that should 
not happen again. Is that correct?
    Mr. Nolen. That is correct.
    Senator Warnock. So, no one contractor who hasn't had their 
morning coffee can accidentally or intentionally ground 
commercial air travel for the whole country. How many other 
single points of failure does the FAA have within its system?
    Mr. Nolen. That is a piece of work that we are undertaking. 
So, part of the effort that we have going with our Office of IT 
and Technology working with MITRE is to assess the totality of 
our systems, of which there are thousands, to make sure what we 
have from a resilience perspective, and we expect that work to 
be completed here in the coming weeks.
    Senator Warnock. So right now, we don't know how many other 
single points of failure we have within our system, and that is 
work you are doing right now?
    Mr. Nolen. That is work that we are doing now.
    Senator Warnock. All right. What steps are you taking the 
audit security and access permissions across all of these 
points of failure to prevent both accidental mistakes and 
malicious intruders?
    Mr. Nolen. This is part of what the investigation is 
designed to do. We are looking at every part of our process, 
from procedures, from access, from control, from resilience to 
redundancy. All of that is in the scope of the investigation.
    Senator Warnock. Well, obviously, all of us were deeply 
troubled by what we witnessed. Its impact on air travel and the 
implications are deeply concerning. This year is, of course, 
FAA reauthorization.
    It is a good time for us to be focused on these issues, and 
I look forward to collaborating with you and with my colleagues 
as we modernize the FAA to increase security, to reduce risk so 
that all of us, certainly my constituents in Georgia and people 
all across the country can fly safely.
    Mr. Nolen. We appreciate the support.
    Senator Warnock. So, I guess--oh, the Chair is back.
    The Chair. Well, Senator Warnock, do you have further 
questions?
    Senator Warnock. Thank you, Madam Chair. I am done. I am 
going to go vote.
    The Chair. OK. Well, maybe we will coordinate here 
together, but thank you. You represent such a big aviation 
state and look forward to working with you on the 
reauthorization bill.
    Administrator Nolen, thank you for your participation. The 
hearing will remain open for 4 weeks until March 15, 2023. Any 
Senators that would like to submit questions for the record 
should do so two weeks from now, by March 1, 2023.
    And we ask the witnesses--witness to respond by March 15, 
2023. So, with that, our hearing is concluded.
    [Whereupon, at 12:15 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to 
                              Billy Nolen
    Ensuring True Redundancy in the NOTAM System. As FAA moves forward 
with a modernization of the NOTAM system, it will be important to 
ensure system redundancy, protection from cyber threats, and resiliency 
for the future. FAA must have redundancies in place to prevent single 
points of failure in key systems. Technology modernization has been a 
challenge for everyone, but we can't lead and uphold the gold standard 
in aviation safety if we aren't prepared for the information age.
    I want to see a plan from the FAA that examines the fact that the 
backup systems are still subject to the same kind of, if you want to 
call it human error, of deletion of files. You're building a system to 
try to prevent that from happening again. But it could be a different 
problem, and we still have a backup system that would be affected. So, 
until we get a fully modernized system, I would like you to go back and 
see what level of redundancy you currently have, to ensure that you 
really have a truly separate backup system that would not be impacted 
by future disruptions.

    Question 1. What plans does the FAA have for ensuring true 
redundancy in the NOTAM system to ensure outages do not occur? And when 
will these plans be fully implemented?
    Answer. The current NOTAM System has both an active and 
geographically separate disaster recovery site providing protection 
against a site failure. In addition, each site also has local 
redundancy to prevent a single point of failure.
    The current database architecture in the disaster recovery site has 
been modified to take advantage of the local redundancy. At the 
disaster recovery site, one database is kept in near real-time sync 
with the active site, and a second one is configured to apply changes 
with a one-hour delay. This mitigates the risk of data deletions/
corruption that recently occurred.
    The ongoing NOTAM Modernization project will consolidate two NOTAM 
systems into a single NOTAM system and transition them to a highly 
resilient NAS operational environment. This new environment will 
provide high-availability services at geographically separate 
locations.

    Question 2. What is FAA's practice with regard to keeping systems 
and software incrementally up to date, which could prevent them from 
becoming outdated and requiring a total replacement?
    Answer. Updating the systems and software in the FAA includes both 
an operations and maintenance (O&M) and enhancement/modernization 
component. All the reported issues are logged and reviewed, and 
approved by a Change Control Board (CCB) consisting of stakeholders. 
Based on the available operational budget, these approved changes are 
planned, developed, tested, and deployed to the operational environment 
as part of the operations and maintenance work. Major changes or 
modernizations that are beyond the realm of operations and maintenance 
are managed via the FAA's Capital Investment Plan (CIP). The capital 
programs are reviewed and prioritized by the FAA executives on the 
Joint Resources Council (JRC).
    FAA's practice with regard to keeping software incrementally up to 
date entails Software Asset Management (SAM) tracking, reporting 
ownership and optimization of software acquisition, deployment, 
maintenance, and utilization within the agency. Policies and practices 
are in place across the FAA to ensure alignment and compliance with SAM 
guidance and mandates issued by the executive and legislative branches 
of the Federal government. FAA is in the process of enhancing its 
software inventory tracking to include all of the FAA domains to 
maintain an accurate, agency-wide software inventory and software 
license/subscription database to ensure knowledge of software assets, 
manage and mitigate risk, and implement Federal guidance and mandates 
associated with software.

    Question 3. What steps if FAA taking to strengthen its oversight of 
contractors associated with maintaining and working on the NOTAM 
system?
    Answer. The FAA updated the standard operating procedures (SOPs) to 
ensure that all changes to the NOTAM operational environment require 
approved documentation. The FAA updated the on-site monitoring and 
staff supervision procedures. The FAA has implemented system protocols 
to reinforce security and resiliency for NAS Aeronautical Information 
Management Enterprise System (NAIMES) and strengthened oversight of 
contractors as follows:

  <bullet> Written consent is required by the FAA NAIMES Services 
        Manager or designated FAA employee for all NAIMES access to the 
        production database(s).

  <bullet> A two-person system was implemented which requires another 
        employee or designated contract member to accompany any 
        Database Administrator, System Administrator, or Network 
        Engineer who has been granted access (in writing) to perform 
        any work in the NAIMES Production System. (This is in addition 
        to the bullet above).

  <bullet> If a contract employee is called in (after hours) to restore 
        services and the two-person construct cannot be adhered to, the 
        responding contract employee should contact the FAA manager or 
        staff. System restoral will take precedence to ensure the 
        safety of the NAS.

    Cuts to Discretionary Spending. Our colleagues in the House have 
been discussing cutting Federal expenditures, primarily non-Defense 
discretionary spending. Some estimates of cuts under considering go as 
high as 10 to 15 percent below enacted levels for this Fiscal Year. The 
FAA's budget for modernizing the air traffic systems comes from this 
discretionary spending.

    Question 1. How would a 10 to 15 percent budget cut impact FAA's 
timeline for implementing NextGen and other air traffic modernization 
efforts?
    Answer. NextGen investments are funded in the FAA's Facilities and 
Equipment appropriation, which funds the acquisition and deployment of 
communications, navigation, surveillance, and related capabilities 
within the National Airspace System (NAS) and air traffic control 
facilities. Under this scenario, the appropriation would be reduced by 
as much as $442 million.
    FAA would cancel and defer system modernization efforts, including 
NextGen programs, system sustainment, and replacement programs. 
Additionally, facility infrastructure programs would be deferred, as 
would any new terminal facility replacement projects.

    Question 2. Do you think there would be an operational safety 
degradation if FAA budgets were cut?
    Answer. For the FAA to operate approximately $2.4 billion below the 
FY 2023 enacted level, it would be forced to immediately cut back on 
its core functions, impacting services to the flying community. A 
reduction of this size would require furloughs and Reduction in Force 
(RIFs) across all of the FAA workforce, safety critical and non-safety 
critical.
    FAA would need to implement an immediate hiring freeze for its 
entire operations and facilities workforce, including air traffic 
controllers and safety inspectors, causing delays in air traffic 
services and certification of aircraft, pilots, drone operators, and 
commercial space licensing. FAA would need to furlough all FAA 
employees, including air traffic controllers and safety inspectors, for 
approximately 22 days and potentially implement a RIFs of up to 10 
percent.
    FAA would need to shut down services at 125 lower activity towers 
and over 250 Federal contract towers resulting in 2/3 of airports 
losing the safety benefits provided by air traffic control towers. FAA 
would also be required to terminate contracts that support air traffic 
safety, including air traffic control training, flight services, 
contract weather observers, system maintenance, and cybersecurity.

    Question 3. Aside from safety impacts, can you forecast other 
impacts to FAA systems if budgets were cut?
    Answer. In addition to the safety impacts, the modernization of 
FAA's telecommunications networks to meet the transition to Internet 
Protocol (IP) technologies would be delayed resulting in possible 
outages that could not be restored as service providers no longer 
support time-division multiplexing (TDM) technology.

    Question 3a. Could those impacts possibly translate into 
inconveniences for the traveling public?
    Answer. Funding cuts of this magnitude would cause substantial 
disruptions to the flying public; including cancelled and delayed 
flights across the country. This would have devastating impacts to the 
National Airspace System, affecting every state and territory through 
reductions in air traffic services.

    Status of NextGen Implementation. In the last FAA Reauthorization 
bill, Congress directed the DOT Office of Inspector General to audit 
NextGen implementation. The DOT OIG audit found FAA was too optimistic 
about program benefits and did not account for complexities in 
implementation.
    FAA now claims that NextGen benefits to be $8.5 billion through 
2021. That is lower than the $9 billion FAA has already spent on 
NextGen and nowhere near the original estimates of the $213 billion in 
benefits by 2025.

    Question 1. Has NextGen failed to deliver on expected results and 
benefits? DOT OIG found that operations were less efficient, with 
average taxi time, departure delays, and arrival delays all increasing 
since the start of NextGen in 2008.
    Answer. Through 2022, NextGen has implemented more than $9.4B in 
benefits (FY22$). The benefits from more than 20 implemented 
capabilities will continue to grow in the future. New implementations 
like En Route DataComm across the NAS will bring additional future 
benefits. Details can be found on the NextGen website at: https://
www.faa.gov/nextgen/reporting-benefits/details.
    Flight times and delays are driven by increases or decreases in 
traffic demand levels. NextGen benefits include adjustments for changes 
in demand. Methodologies for evaluating NextGen benefits have been 
evaluated through the FAA/Industry Joint Analysis Team (JAT) supporting 
the NextGen Advisory Committee.

    Question 2. Could you clarify how updating the NOTAM system fits 
into NextGen modernization? What can we do to get NextGen back on track 
or should Congress focus on new ways to modernize the National Airspace 
System?
    Answer. Although, much of the NextGen infrastructure is in place 
and operationalizing NextGen is well underway, there is much more work 
to be done. As FAA continues to operationalize NextGen and realize 
Trajectory Based Operations, we will build on these two foundations to 
evolve into a modern, information-centered or ``info-centric'' National 
Airspace System (ICN) built for diverse operations and supported by a 
resilient and evolving infrastructure to enhance safety and efficiency.
    Modernization of the NAS requires a significant and consistent 
investment in sustaining the current capabilities, while also funding 
modernization integrating new capabilities. These steps are necessary 
to make sure the foundational operational services, such as voice and 
data communications, surveillance, automation, navigation, 
telecommunications, and weather systems are modernized and to ensure 
the NAS is efficient.
    Specifically for NOTAMs, the three pillars of an Info-Centric NAS 
are Operations, Supporting Infrastructure, and Integrated Safety 
Management. NOTAMs provide dynamic changes in the state of NAS features 
affecting flight operations, which is critical for flight safety.
    The updates to the NOTAM System include consolidating legacy system 
capabilities into the new NOTAM system that is built using digital 
NOTAM as the foundation. Digital NOTAMs allow the dissemination of 
dynamic changes in a globally harmonized message format called AIXM 
(Aeronautical Information Exchange Model), which allows machine 
interpretation and graphical display of the underlying hazard.
    This modernization completely aligns with NextGen Modernization as 
the objective is to provide near real-time machine interpretable NOTAM 
(dynamic changes), which enables real-time situational awareness for 
all stakeholders.

    Question 3. FAA has said it is moving to ``info-centric'' National 
Airspace System by 2035. What exactly does this involve and how does 
this implicate NextGen?
    Answer. As FAA continues to operationalize NextGen and realize 
Trajectory Based Operations, we will build on these two foundations to 
evolve into an information-centered or ``info-centric'' National 
Airspace System (ICN) built for diverse operations and supported by a 
resilient and evolving infrastructure to enhance safety and efficiency.
    ICN will be building on the NextGen foundation in three areas: 
operations, infrastructure and integrated safety management. This 
involves establishing an integrated information regime with 
interoperable sharing of information to enable enhanced collaboration 
with diverse traffic management services that includes new vehicles and 
operations. This will be accomplished by infrastructure modernization 
by leveraging new technologies and, where necessary, establishing 
public-private partnerships to not only ensure resiliency and agility 
to respond to future user needs but also to meet unique government 
requirements through commercial services and technologies. In addition, 
Safety Assurance for traffic management and real-time safety will be 
established through continuous monitoring, modeling, and verification 
including the use of the Safety Management System for compliance to 
assure organizational accountability.

    Chinese Balloon & Airspace Incursions. We have seen a recent string 
of extraordinary incursions into U.S. airspace including a Chinese 
surveillance balloon shot down by our military on February 4. Uncrewed, 
high-altitude objects were shot down over Alaska, Michigan, and Canada.
    The North American Air Defense Identification Zone (``ADIZ'') is 
jointly administered by the civilian air traffic control authorities 
and militaries of the United States and Canada. By law, civilian 
aircraft entering this zone must provide proper notification to air 
traffic controllers.

    Question 1. What more does our Nation need to do in order to 
strengthen the defense of our national airspace? How can we make sure 
FAA has the tools necessary to detect these aircraft intruding upon and 
ultimately entering U.S. airspace?
    Answer. Defense of our national airspace is a complex topic and 
requires much collaboration between the FAA, the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS), and the Department of Defense (DOD). The FAA long range 
RADARs (Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR-4) and CARSR) did detect the 
Chinese balloon. These RADARs are optimized to delete high altitude and 
slow detections in order to provide professional air traffic 
controllers with the optimal air traffic RADAR presentation. The FAA 
did not monitor the Chinese balloon, but the FAA staff embedded with 
DOD did have awareness. The Chinese balloon was operating at an 
altitude above 60,000 feet and presented no threat to the National 
Airspace Systems.
    While the current FAA tools detected the balloon, the FAA's ARSR-4 
are past their life expectancy. The agency, with the support of 
Congress, will need to work in collaboration with DOD and DHS on the 
replacement program.

    Question 2. FAA has closed parts of the U.S. airspace to support 
military action against these aircraft. Can you describe the effect 
that these aerial intrusions have had on civilian air travel?
    Answer. Closing parts of the U.S. Airspace system is a key tool 
used by the FAA to protect the flying public and by-standers on the 
ground when military action is required. The closure of airspace 
routinely impacts civilian air travel by necessitating re-routes and 
ground stops at airports underlying FAA's Temporary Flight Restriction 
(TFR). These impacts result in arrival, departure, and en route delays. 
Any airspace restrictions levied are continuously evaluated to ensure 
they are in place no longer than required to execute the national 
defense mission and to preserve safety while minimizing the impact to 
civilian air travel. A mechanism the FAA employs to facilitate this 
action is having senior FAA staff embedded with key DOD air defense 
commands to advise DOD Flag Officers. The senior FAA embeds provide 
recommendations to the military decision makers and seek to preserve 
access to the National Airspace Systems for all public users. These 
embeds have immediate reach back to the FAA at the executive level 
(SES2) to resolve any national airspace issues that may arise.

    Question 3. How is FAA, as the owner of our national airspace 
management, coordinating with other agencies such as NASA, NOAA, DHS, 
and DOD who have shared interests in protecting our national security?
    Answer. The FAA regularly collaborates with NASA, NOAA, DHS, and 
DOD. The FAA has several directorates that coordinate with NASA to 
support the planning/scheduling of space launches as well as providing 
support for airspace security requirements. NOAA maintains a watch 
position within the Air Traffic Organization's (ATO) Joint Air Traffic 
Operations Command (JATOC) located in the Air Traffic Control System 
Command Center facility. These NOAA personnel have 24-hour access to 
National Operations Managers and NOAA is part of multiple daily 
briefings. The FAA continuously coordinates with DHS concerning air 
domain homeland security issues, including UAS, Counter-UAS, and law 
enforcement matters. This coordination is facilitated by the FAA's 
embedding of operational personnel who specialize in Air Traffic 
Management security matters within the Transportation Security 
Administrations (TSA) Transportation Security Operations Center (TSOC) 
in Herndon, VA, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Air and Marine 
Operations Center (AMOC) in Riverside, CA.
    The FAA has advisors embedded with DOD Flag Officer Level leaders 
at NORAD/NORTHCOM headquarters; the Continental NORAD Region (CONR); 
Alaskan NORAD Region; Western Air Defense Sector; Eastern Air Defense 
Sector; and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM). Moreover, FAA SES 
leadership engages with DOD regularly to discussion concerns and future 
threats and FAA supporting staff engages with Pentagon staff on a 
routine basis.
    The national security shared interests are primarily between FAA, 
DOD, and DHS. This common interest results in the sharing of RADAR 
data, the protection of sensitive and classified information, and the 
coordination of real-time national security concerns. The coordination 
across FAA, DOD, and DHS happens at many levels and continuously, but 
the previously discussed Senior FAA embeds are critical elements to our 
successful real time collaboration and support for national security.

    Question 4. Did the FAA, in association with the DOD, identify, 
detect, and monitor the Chinese surveillance balloon when this object 
entered the ADIZ as identified in 14 C.F.R. Subpart B? Did the Chinese 
surveillance balloon, comply with the requirements of 14 C.F.R. Part 
99? If not, what action is FAA taking to enforce the ADIZ requirements?
    Answer. The FAA long range RADARs (ARSR-4 and CARSR) did detect the 
Chinese balloon. These RADARs are optimized to delete high altitude and 
slow detections in order to provide professional air traffic 
controllers with the optimal air traffic RADAR presentation. The FAA 
did not monitor the Chinese balloon, but the FAA staff embedded with 
DOD did have awareness. The Chinese balloon was operating at an 
altitude above 60,000 feet and presented no threat to the National 
Airspace Systems.
    The Chinese Balloon did not operate in accordance with 14 CFR Part 
99 in that no position reports were made in accordance with 14 C.F.R. 
99.15.
    To enforce ADIZ requirements, the FAA staffs operational positions 
at the NORAD NORTHCOM Command Center (N2C2), CONR's 601st Air and Space 
Operations Center (AOC), and CBP's AMOC. FAA and DOD work 
collaboratively to identify and determine threats associated with RADAR 
tracks approaching the ADIZ. Balloons specifically pose a challenge due 
to slow speed and in case of the Chinese balloon, the high altitude 
coupled with slow speed. That said, the FAA is working to determine how 
a comprehensive inventory of all unmanned airborne objects can best be 
developed. The agency's exploration includes seeking to implement 
further measures to improve capacity to detect objects in our airspace.

    Recent Runway Incursions. There have been five runway incursions 
over the last couple of weeks at airports in the United States, raising 
serious concerns about aviation safety and congestion in the airspace. 
Additionally, there is a projected increase in demand from current and 
future users of the NAS, which will place further strain on the system.

    Question 1. How can NextGen technology reduce the risk of runway 
incursions at airports?
    Answer. NextGen technology including Automatic Dependent 
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), Airport Surface Detection System Model 
X (ASDE-X), Airport Surface Surveillance Capability (ASSC), and Runway 
Status Lights (RWSL) have reduced the risk of runway incursions at 
airports. ASDE-X and ASSC allow air traffic controllers to track 
surface movement of aircraft and vehicles enhancing air traffic 
controller situational awareness. These systems alert air traffic 
controllers of potential runway conflicts by providing detailed 
coverage of movement on runways and taxiways. Runway Status Lights 
(RWSL) is a fully automatic, advisory system designed to reduce the 
number and severity of runway incursions and prevent runway accidents 
while not interfering with airport operations.
    The FAA's Office of NextGen through the Runway Incursion 
Reduction--Advanced Technology Development and Prototyping (ATDP) 
Program, is currently researching technologies to reduce the risk to 
people and property caused by collisions in the runway environment. 
This program is designed to identify different types of affordable 
surveillance system technologies, that are suitable for small-to-medium 
sized airports with scheduled passenger service that do not currently 
have existing runway incursion detection technologies such as Airport 
Surface Detection System Model X (ASDE-X), Airport Surface Surveillance 
Capability (ASSC), and Runway Status Lights (RWSL). Runway Incursion 
Prevention through Situational Awareness (RIPSA) is aimed at 
reinforcing protection of the Runway Safety Area (RSA), by utilizing 
``direct-to-pilot'' alerts to the individual(s) who can take corrective 
action, for all aircraft or vehicles at Runway Incursion (RI) hotspot 
locations.

    Question 1a. What other actions are being taken by the FAA to 
address these safety concerns?
    Answer. In response to the recent runway incursions, we have taken 
the opportunity to verify and update our data resources. One of these 
resources includes our Runway Safety Dashboard. Since 2022, the 
Dashboard has been a source of information showing trends in runway 
incursions throughout the National Airspace System (NAS). It identifies 
which facilities have a runway incursion rate higher than the NAS wide 
runway incursion rate. Runway Safety Program Managers throughout each 
Service Area monitor the Dashboard on a weekly basis to determine which 
of their respective facilities may need Runway Safety support in 
developing possible mitigations in reducing surface risk.
    In addition to the Dashboard, FAA Order 7050.1B (Runway Safety 
Order) requires facilities to host a Runway Safety Action Team (RSAT) 
meeting on an annual basis. During this meeting, stakeholders from the 
area come together to discuss surface safety at the local airport. 
These stakeholders include, but are not limited to, Air Traffic 
Controllers, Pilots, Fixed Based Operators, and Airport Operators. 
During the meeting, previous runway incursions that occurred at the 
airport are reviewed and discussed, along with any other issues that 
may not be previously known to all users. The team determines what 
mitigations, if any, need to be developed to prevent future occurrences 
or improve surface safety.
    The Surface Safety Group (SSG) and Runway Safety Council (RSC) are 
made up of FAA and Industry personnel who have a duty and desire to 
increase surface safety in the NAS. These two groups meet on a 
quarterly basis and develop action items based on trends in the NAS. 
Each party represents their organization and provides input to any 
topics that are discussed during the meeting. Once in agreement, the 
group creates an action item, which once completed, will effect a 
change in the NAS that will improve surface safety on a National Level.
    Lastly, our outreach efforts include our From the Flight Deck 
(FTFD) videos, Pilot Handbooks, and an annual Safety Summit focused on 
General Aviation pilots. The FTFD videos provide airport specific 
issues that provide pilots a tool that they can use prior to landing or 
departing from that airport. The video provides information to warn 
pilots of hot spots or identified problem areas on the airport that 
pilots may not be aware of. Furthermore, Pilot Handbooks are created as 
a supplement to the FTFD video to provide information to the pilot from 
the control tower perspective. The Handbook includes information that 
Air Traffic Controllers want a pilot to be aware of and may not know 
prior to using the airport. Our annual Safety Summit, which was just 
held on March 22, discusses National trends that the Runway Safety 
Office is seeing from General Aviation users. It is meant to refresh 
those pilots who have possibly not flown in a few months due to their 
airplane being in storage for the winter months. This year's topics 
included, pre-flight procedures, wrong surface, and airport signage and 
markings.

    Question 2. How is the FAA proactively preparing for the future 
growth in demand while maintaining a safe and efficient NAS?
    Answer. The FAA is proactively preparing for future growth in 
demand while maintaining a safe and efficient NAS by addressing the 
maintainability and obsolescence issues with the surveillance systems. 
This will ensure continued functionality of all surveillance 
capabilities into the future that have led to increased runway safety, 
improved efficiency in air traffic, and increased airport throughput.
    The agency's FY2024 budget request addresses critical obsolescence, 
life cycle support challenges for our systems, and helps maintain 
continuity of the services the systems provide. The majority of the 
radar inventory is over 40 years old, and all have passed their 20-year 
life cycle. This means many essential parts are no longer manufactured, 
available, or eligible for redesign and our work to support these aging 
systems has taken on a new urgency to bridge the gap to implementing 
modernization efforts.
    We are committed to our mission and moving forward to sustain radar 
surveillance services by implementing safety, security, and 
technological enhancements to bridge critical system capabilities until 
replaced or divested. We continue to do this work while simultaneously 
planning to acquire cooperative radar systems, non-cooperative radar 
systems, and other specialty solutions to sustain radar surveillance 
capabilities.
    Additionally, the FAA is developing more precise success metrics 
and predictive analytics, including improvements to the Runway 
Incursion Mitigation (RIM) tool, which will enhance mitigation status, 
graphical AGIS interface for runway incursions and reports, program 
metrics tracking, etc.

    Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Amy Klobuchar to 
                              Billy Nolen
    FAA Contract Towers Program. Investing in our Nation's 
infrastructure includes continued investment in the FAA's contract 
tower program, which provides critical air traffic control safety 
benefits to 256 smaller airports across the country, including St. 
Cloud and Anoka County airports in Minnesota.

    Question. What can Congress do to ensure that contract tower 
airports have the updated infrastructure and facilities they need to 
accommodate rising air traffic levels?
    Answer. The infrastructure at some Federal Contract Towers (FCTs) 
are in need of repair or replacement. The Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act (IIJA) included resources for FCTs and specifies that not less 
than $200 million of the IIJA F&E funding is for towers ``that are 
owned by the FAA and staffed through the contract tower program.'' In 
addition, the Airport Infrastructure Grants component of the IIJA 
includes a $20 million annual set aside to make competitive grants to 
sponsors of airports participating in the contract tower program and 
the contract tower cost share program. Last August, the FAA awarded the 
FY 2022 grants under this program, announcing the selection of 20 
projects across 18 states. Selected projects will rehabilitate and 
upgrade FCTs, replace obsolete equipment, and conduct planning, 
environmental, and design for future replacements. On March 31 2023, 
FAA announced this year's selection of 33 grant awards at 29 airports 
across 23 states and territories. These grants will sustain, construct, 
repair, improve, modernize, replace or relocate airport-owned towers, 
and install communications equipment.

    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Gary Peters to 
                              Billy Nolen
    Question 1. Mr. Nolen, the reliability of the NOTAM system is 
essential to all of our National Airspace--but the ability to provide 
real-time data on runway conditions is especially essential for 
Michigan in winter, where our airports are dealing with constantly 
changing conditions and winter weather. During the NOTAM outage in 
January, Detroit Metropolitan Airport shared with me that they were 
told to ``utilize alternate means of compliance'' to share key flight 
and runway condition information with flight crews. However no such 
alternate means exist other than a 1-877 number that was quickly 
overwhelmed. Mr. Nolen, is FAA developing a more comprehensive 
contingency plan in case of future NOTAM outages that will allow 
participants in our national airspace to quickly divert to another 
agreed upon method for communicating this vital information?
    Answer. Yes, the agency has developed a comprehensive contingency 
plan intended to provide NOTAM information to all airspace users and 
allow them to maintain operations in the event of a future NOTAM system 
outage.
    The goal of this contingency plan is to provide a backstop during 
an unplanned, full outage to the primary NOTAM system while the system 
is being recovered. The contingency plan allows FAA and its 
stakeholders to maintain an accurate picture of the status of National 
Airspace System (NAS) components while the primary NOTAM system is 
recovered by allowing authorized personnel to issue ``candidate'' 
NOTAMs--i.e., NOTAMs not yet entered into the official NOTAM system--
and distribute them to the public using a standalone website. NAS users 
will be able to use this information to maintain their situational 
awareness until the NOTAM system is restored, after which any candidate 
NOTAMs will be reconciled with the primary NOTAM system.
    FAA is coordinating with our labor and industry partners on the 
details of this contingency plan.

    Question 2. Mr. Nolen, GAO recently released a report (GAO-23-
105189) detailing some of the FAA's shortcomings when it comes to 
integrating UAS into our national airspace. GAO's first recommendation 
tasked the FAA with developing a comprehensive drone strategy. Can you 
provide the committee with an update on the status of FAA's 
implementation of this and the other recommendations in the report?
    Answer. The FAA is working collaboratively to address the GAO's 
concerns to develop a comprehensive drone strategy that also 
incorporates lessons learned for its drone integration activities. The 
FAA also currently provides part 107 waiver safety explanation 
guidelines on our public website.

    Question 3. In the 116th Congress, my Drone Advisory Committee 
(DAC) for the 21st Century Act was signed into law as P.L. 116-280. The 
bill directed the FAA to take appropriate steps to encourage direct 
representation of county and tribal governments, as well as 
agriculture, forestry, rangeland sectors, and other rural interests on 
the Drone Advisory Committee. Can you provide an update on what steps 
the FAA has taken to implement this bill?
    Answer. The Drone Advisory Committee was re-chartered as the 
Advanced Aviation Advisory Committee (AAAC) in June 2022 to better 
reflect the evolving ecosystem of new aviation entrants. The FAA has 
conducted significant outreach to numerous organizations to encourage 
them to submit requests to provide direct representation of county and 
tribal governments, as well as agriculture, forestry, rangeland 
sectors, and other rural interests on the AAAC. Currently, three 
individuals represent the Local, State, Tribal and/or Territorial 
stakeholder group and two individuals represent the Agricultural 
Interests stakeholder group on the AAAC.

  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tammy Duckworth to 
                              Billy Nolen
Topic: 5G Wireless Interference
    Airlines for America recently urged the FAA to extend its proposed 
deadline to June 2024 to retrofit aircraft with altimeters that won't 
experience interference from 5G wireless technology. This four month 
delay highlights the years of communication breakdown between FAA and 
FCC during the development and rollout of 5G.

    Question 1. Is the FAA receiving all the technical information it 
needs from the FCC and wireless carriers to ensure that 5G does not 
interfere with aircraft altimeters or any other technology needed for 
aviation safety? If not, what information is FAA not yet receiving?
    Answer. Yes, the agency is in receipt of all the required technical 
information on the performance and operating characteristics of 5G 
equipment that are needed to ensure compatibility with aviation safety. 
Since late 2021, the FAA has engaged in regular and direct technical 
interchanges with the 5G wireless carriers and FCC in order to better 
understand the potential impact of 5G systems on radio altimeters. 
These exchanges proved invaluable to the FAA's ability to directly 
assess the impact of 5G operations and to make rapid decisions that 
ensured the short-term compatibility of these technologies.
    From July 2022 to March 2023, the FAA has used information learned 
about 5G characteristics to secure long-term arrangements that ensure 
the compatibility of these two technologies. The FCC and 5G wireless 
carriers have been faithful and positive contributors to the process, 
with the FAA and wireless carriers forging new collaborative working 
relations that we expect to build upon in the coming years.

    Question 2. Does the FAA have the resources it needs to ensure that 
all passenger aircraft equipped with technology to prevent 5G from 
interfering with flight operations? Does it need anything additional 
from Congress?
    Answer. Yes, the agency has the resources to continue ensuring 
compatibility between 5G systems and radio altimeters that are required 
for successful flight operations. The aviation industry is currently 
engaged in a large-scale retrofit program that increases the 5G 
tolerance of the avionics systems that are impacted by 5G. This 
retrofit will continue into 2024. The FAA is finalizing a rulemaking 
that ensures aircraft are properly equipped to resist emissions from 5G 
equipment beginning in February 2024. Between now and February 2024, 
the FAA is managing safety through our existing process of Alternative 
Means of Compliance (AMOCs). These AMOCs assign an aircraft's allowed 
operational parameters on a per-runway basis using the known 5G 
environment at each airport. Through efficient management of aircraft 
tolerance to 5G and monitoring of the 5G environment as it continues to 
expand, the FAA is well positioned to ensure compatibility between 
these technologies. Additional resources from Congress are not required 
at this time.

    Question 3. Is FAA sharing all relevant information with the FCC 
and air carriers to prevent 5G from interfering with flight operations?
    Answer. Yes, the FAA has regular engagement with both the FCC and 
air carriers during which both groups are kept up-to-date on all 
relevant information required for the compatibility of 5G and radio 
altimeters. The FAA meets three times per week with the aviation 
industry in a task force that was stood up early in 2022 specifically 
to address the compatibility of these technologies. Additionally, the 
FAA has hosted several round table events with aviation stakeholders to 
share developments in the ongoing work to ensure compatibility. Since 
July 2022, the FAA has met directly with the FCC several times to work 
through technical discussions regarding potential interference to radio 
altimeters. The FAA has also been meeting weekly with the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) Office of 
Spectrum Management to share updates on the ongoing work to ensure 
short-term and long-term compatibility of these systems. The NTIA has 
served as a liaison between the FAA and FCC, sharing technical issues 
and soliciting feedback as necessary.

    Question 4. Based on the FAA's experience with 5G, do you have any 
concerns about the level of cooperation and information sharing the FAA 
will receive from the FCC in the future?
    Answer. The existing information-sharing structure between the FCC 
and FAA is sufficient in that the FAA is made aware of proposed 
spectrum repurposing efforts by the FCC and is provided an opportunity 
to supply feedback on the impact of those proposed changes.
    Unfortunately, it is often difficult for FAA to achieve a thorough 
and complete technical analysis of the potential impact to aviation in 
what is normally a relatively short period for comment. This has 
historically led to difficulties in providing nuanced engineering 
assessments of spectrum compatibility that can be used to 
collaboratively improve the outcomes of FCC proposed spectrum 
repurposing.
    The FAA's experience with 5G has demonstrated that true innovation, 
cooperation, and engineering problem-solving cannot efficiently occur 
without direct engagement between the key stakeholders/owners of 
wireless systems. When the wireless system stakeholders engage directly 
to share information and engineer systems that ensure compatibility, 
new opportunities emerge as a stronger understanding of the potential 
system interactions is achieved.
    FCC efforts to repurpose spectrum would likely experience more 
positive outcomes with longer timelines afforded for the impacted 
stakeholders to assess the technical parameters of each proposal with 
engineering studies, rapid-deployment interference testing, and 
industry feedback.

    Question 5. Will FAA commit to coordinating with the FCC and 
wireless carriers earlier in the development process of future 
technologies so this doesn't happen again?
    Answer. Yes, this is one of the primary lessons learned through the 
5G experience. The FAA has found that direct and early engagement 
between agencies and external stakeholders is critical to the success 
of any proposed spectrum repurposing efforts.
Topic: Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen)
    According to the Department of Transportation Inspector General, as 
of 2017 NextGen was estimated to generate $100 billion in benefits 
against a $36 billion investment. However, back in 2007, NextGen was 
estimated to result in $213 billion in benefits.

    Question 1. Can you provide an update on NextGen's estimated 
benefits and is FAA still thinking it will be around $100 billion?
    Answer. The $100B estimate for NextGen Benefits was developed prior 
to the COVID pandemic. COVID has impacted both implementation schedules 
and air traffic demand making future benefit projections very 
uncertain.
    Through 2022, NextGen has now implemented more than $9.4B in 
benefits (FY22$). The benefits from more than 20 implemented 
capabilities will continue to grow in the future. New implementations 
like En Route DataComm across the NAS will bring additional future 
benefits. Details can be found on the NextGen website at: https://
www.faa.gov/nextgen/reporting-benefits/details.
    With current funding levels, the FAA continues to make smart 
decisions in program prioritizations and calculations of the number of 
sites affordable.

    Question 2. How much longer is it going to take and how much more 
is it going to cost to finish NextGen?
    Answer. NextGen is a portfolio of programs, systems, and procedures 
at different levels of maturity that will provide enhanced capabilities 
for the movement and management of air traffic. The work in the 
portfolio is being deployed in stages. Many enhancements are currently 
in deployment, some are nearing implementation, and some of the 
capabilities of NextGen are being defined and matured, as the 
technology to support them becomes available (Pre-Implementation).

    Question 3. If Congress wants to accelerate the completion of 
NextGen what does Congress need to do in this year's FAA 
reauthorization to make that happen?
    Answer. We look forward to working with Congress on a long-term 
reauthorization proposal and adequate funding for FAA's modernization 
needs. The President's FY 2024 budget request supports NextGen 
capabilities. The budget proposal includes $701.9 million in support of 
NextGen programs, which aims to improve the safety, efficiency, 
capacity, and environmental impact of the Nation's air transportation 
system through the use of advanced technology, procedures, and 
infrastructure.

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Kyrsten Sinema to 
                              Billy Nolen
    NOTAM Failure. As you know, the failure of the nationwide Notice to 
Air Missions (NOTAM) system on January 11, 2023, led to the first 
nationwide ground stop of air traffic since the September 11, 2001 
terrorist attacks. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has 
reported that a FAA contractor inadvertently deleted files while 
attempting to correct a synchronization issue involving the primary and 
backup NOTAM databases. This deletion ultimately led the entire NOTAM 
system to become compromised.

    Question 1. How did this issue occur? Was the FAA contractor 
following appropriate procedures and best practices when the file 
deletion took place?
    Answer. While performing unapproved corrective maintenance, the 
contractor inadvertently deleted files. This is not an approved 
procedure.

    Question 2. Can you explain any steps the FAA has taken in order to 
mitigate the risk that one accident could lead to the collapse of the 
NOTAM system? Are there new redundancies in effect?
    Answer. The FAA has taken steps to bring the NOTAM system in 
alignment with our current practices and procedures used in maintaining 
and modifying NAS systems. Additionally we have increased our 
monitoring capabilities in the enterprise environment.
    The current NOTAM System has both an active and geographically 
separate disaster recovery site. Each site also has local redundancy to 
prevent a single point of failure.
    The current database architecture in the disaster recovery site has 
been modified to take advantage of the local redundancy where one 
database is kept in near real-time sync with the active site, and a 
second one is configured to apply changes with a one-hour delay. This 
mitigates the risk of data deletions/corruption that recently occurred.
    The ongoing NOTAM Modernization project will consolidate two NOTAM 
systems into a single NOTAM system and also transition it to a highly 
resilient NAS operational environment by 2025. The infrastructure 
supporting NOTAM modernization will provide high-availability services 
at geographically separate locations.

    Question 3. This incident highlighted the vulnerability of the 
NOTAM system and brought U.S. air traffic to a halt. Though this 
incident was caused by human error, can you explain the safeguards the 
FAA has in place to prevent a cyberattack from disabling the NOTAM 
system?
    Answer. The current infrastructure architecture of the NOTAM 
operational environment follows a layered security approach for public-
facing websites; operational IP (OPIP), and public-facing websites are 
continuously monitored by the NAS Cybersecurity Operations (NCO). The 
Mission Support network is also monitored 24/7 by a Security Operations 
Control Center for any suspicious or malicious activity. We assess 
security controls regularly and deploy patches and certifications 
regularly to ensure systems are up to date.

    Question 4. Why did United Airlines issue a nationwide ground stop 
for its network almost an hour before the FAA ordered a ground stop for 
all aviation traffic? Did United take different safety information into 
account?
    Answer. Late on January 10, 2023, NOTAM applications and services 
became unreliable. While technical experts worked through the night, 
the FAA activated a hotline to provide real-time status updates to 
system users. During this time, there were no reports of operational 
impacts. In the early morning hours of January 11, 2023, the system 
appeared to have been restored, but formatting issues persisted. To 
resolve this, FAA's air traffic leadership directed the rebuild of the 
databases. As the morning air traffic rush approached, and work on the 
system continued, a ground stop was ordered at approximately 7:15 a.m. 
EST, pausing all departures in the United States in order to maintain 
safety and preserve predictability.
    Although airlines and safety experts were consulted on the ground 
stop, we do not have specific information on the timelines for 
individual airlines. Once resiliency testing on the system was 
conducted, the ground stop was lifted at 9:07 a.m. EST on January 11, 
2023.

    Dual NOTAM Systems. There are two NOTAM systems currently in 
operation. The legacy U.S. NOTAM System is 30 years old while the 
modern Federal NOTAM System remains a work in progress as FAA 
modernization efforts continue. The FAA has been working to fully 
stand-up the Federal NOTAM system for years and expects full 
implementation to conclude by 2030.

    Question 5. Why do some airspace users continue to rely on the 
legacy NOTAM system?
    Answer. To clarify, the current NOTAM system has multiple means for 
NOTAMs to be provided to the NOTAM databases, and multiple output 
methods for various users.
    Both systems are required today to operate the full of the NOTAM 
capability. For example, the NOTAM System still provides a ``serial 
number'' for any NOTAM generated, whether it comes from the U.S. NOTAM 
System (USNS) or Federal NOTAM System (FNS) inputs. The applications 
for originating airspace NOTAMs, such as Temporary Flight Restriction 
(TFR), Altitude Reservation (ALTRV), and Special Activity Airspace 
(SAA), still depend on the legacy NOTAM System (USNS) because the 
required functionality is not available within the new system (FNS). 
This gap is being addressed partially in the ongoing NOTAM 
Modernization (FNS Sustainment) and fully in the next phase of AIM 
Modernization referred to as AIMM Enhancement 1 (E1).
    NOTAM origination applications are past their end of life and need 
to be replaced before they affect the safety of the NAS. The goal of 
AIMM E1 is to consolidate all these functionalities which today are 
supported via three different applications, into a single application 
and also enable digital NOTAMs, so they can not only be disseminated 
via a globally harmonized message standard enabling machine 
interpretation and enabling graphical visualization, a key requirement 
from the industry.
    Some users, like DOD, and some legacy search tools still used by 
some airports and consumers, use distribution systems connected to the 
older software system, USNS. Modernization of both systems into one 
modern architecture will move all origination and all distribution 
services and consumers into one system.

    Question 6. What resources does the FAA need to complete the 
Federal NOTAM system? Can you commit to the 2030 timeline for Federal 
NOTAM implementation? If not, what obstacles may the FAA encounter that 
could affect that timeline?
    Answer. The investment that is currently being implemented (Federal 
NOTAM System Sustainment) addresses two aspects of NOTAM modernization: 
the consolidation of the legacy NOTAM system (United States NOTAM 
System) functionality into the Federal NOTAM System and the transfer of 
the NOTAM system off the outdated hardware platform onto an Integrated 
Enterprise Services platform.
    With full support of the President's Budget, Congress can reduce 
the funding and timing obstacles that the FAA may encounter with 
implementing a large, long-term project.

    Question 7. In addition, when can the FAA sunset the legacy U.S. 
NOTAM system? Are there steps Congress can take to encourage legacy 
NOTAM users, including the Department of Defense, to migrate to the 
Federal NOTAM system?
    Answer. To comply with the legislative requirement, in 2019, the 
FAA began developing an acquisition strategy to consolidate the 
multiple platforms into a single Federal NOTAM System (FNS). The plan 
includes retiring legacy components and moving FNS to a more reliable 
and resilient environment built specifically to support critical NAS 
operations. The President's FY 2024 budget request for NOTAM 
modernization seeks resources to ensure legacy NOTAM users have the 
necessary capabilities to migrate along with the FAA.

  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Raphael Warnock to 
                              Billy Nolen
    Infrastructure Investment and Cybersecurity. Thank you for 
discussing cybersecurity protections regarding the NOTAM system, which 
plays a critical role in aviation safety. I am glad you agreed to 
follow up with several of my questions in writing.

    Question 1. In response to my question of whether as of January 10, 
2023, FAA officials were aware that deleting certain files could 
disrupt the synchronization between the live and primary NOTAM 
databases, you responded that ``Yes, the Administrator knew that.'' \1\ 
How many FAA staff were aware that deleting these files would disrupt 
the synchronization, resulting in a NOTAM outage?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2023/2/the-federal-aviation-
administration-s-notam-system-failure-and-its-impacts-on-a-resilient-
national-airspace at 02:10:08.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer. The event on January 10 was an accidental deletion/movement 
of what is called a data file of an Oracle database. The Oracle data 
file is a physical file that stores data. It is a critical component of 
the Oracle database that holds the data from tables, indexes, and other 
database objects. It is equivalent to a critical operating system file 
on all our desktop machines. Moving and/or deleting the data file while 
the system is running can lead to errors and, in the worst scenario, 
complete system failure.
    The deletion of files did not disrupt synchronization. Lack of 
synchronization existed before the outage, and was not caused by 
deleting the files. During our investigation, it was discovered the 
synchronization had not been occurring with all secondary databases. 
The deletion of files removed the only set of files from the 
operational system.
    To prevent such issues in the future, several procedural steps have 
been taken to monitor activities when staff need to work on the 
operational NOTAM system.

    Question 2. How long were these FAA officials aware of this 
specific vulnerability?
    Answer. Although human error is never completely avoidable, the FAA 
has maintained the NOTAM system for years with support from the current 
vendor. We have taken steps to transition the NOTAM system to 
traditional NAS maintenance and change management oversight. Preventive 
measures have been put in place to prevent such issues in the future 
for this system, including oversight by an FAA lead for all maintenance 
and changes. Additionally, the FAA conducted an assessment of the 
configuration and change management practices for all systems and 
services that could impact the NAS and we are in the process of 
determining what additional system design or controls are needed to 
close any gaps. No immediate high risks have been identified in that 
analysis and the lower level risks are being addressed on the few 
contractor maintained systems that exist. No additional systems have 
been identified that could have nationwide implications or even 
significant localized impacts.

    Question 3. Since FAA officials, including the Administrator 
(according to your testimony), were aware of this vulnerability, why 
were there not additional safeguards to ensure that contractors could 
not inadvertently delete those files?
    Answer. Careful handling of data files is part of database 
administrator training. We have hired qualified and certified database 
administrators to support the program and expect them to follow the 
basic requirements. To prevent such issues in the future, several 
procedural steps have been taken when staff need to work on the NOTAM 
system.

    Question 4. When I asked how many contractors had access to the 
NOTAM system, you stated there were two people working in the system 
but that you did not have an exact number of how many individuals had 
sufficient access to delete those specific files.\2\ Thank you agreeing 
to following up with me in writing on this point. In addition to the 
two contractors who were involved in this specific incident, how many 
other contractors and FAA staff had sufficient permissions to access 
and delete those files, as of January 10, 2023?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ Id. at 02:11:05.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer. Access to the NOTAM system would include all approved and 
authorized staff on the contract that includes System Administrators 
and Database Administrators (DBA) (total eight contractors) who have 
complete access to the system.

    Question 5. In your testimony, you stated that some of the new 
controls that FAA has installed include requiring two people to delete 
critical files that could disrupt the database synchronization, 
resulting in a NOTAM outage.\3\ As of today, what is the total number 
of individuals who are eligible to be one of the two individuals under 
the new controls? How many of these are contractors, and how many are 
FAA staff?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ Id. at 02:11:48.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer. New controls are in place, to have Federal employees 
directly oversee and provide approvals for all eight contractors while 
maintaining and/or modifying the system.

    Question 6. In addition to the new control listed above, what other 
new protocols has FAA implemented to strengthen procedures, access, 
controls, resilience, and redundancies to limit the effects of SPOF?
    Answer. The NOTAM System has both an active and geographically 
separate disaster recovery site providing protection against a site 
failure. In addition, each site also has local redundancy to prevent a 
single point of failure.
    The current database architecture in the disaster recovery site has 
been modified to take advantage of the local redundancy. At the 
disaster recovery site, one database is kept in near real-time sync 
with the active site, and a second one is configured to apply changes 
with a one-hour delay. This mitigates the risk of data deletions/
corruption that recently occurred.
    Additional controls have been added to monitor database 
synchronization. The FAA has taken steps to transition the NOTAM system 
to traditional NAS maintenance and change management oversight.
    The FAA has also developed a backup ability for operators to access 
new/modified NOTAMs in the event of a complete failure (disaster) 
affecting the primary and secondary systems as well as the disaster 
recovery site. The FAA is continuing to look at additional controls, 
tests, improved system monitoring to respond to load, and demand issues 
proactively.

    Question 7. As I stated, I believe that it is unacceptable for the 
FAA to have single points of failure (SPOFs) within critical systems 
like NOTAM. As your review of the root causes of this incident has 
continued, how many SPOFs has the FAA discovered within its NOTAM 
systems?
    Answer. The FAA has taken steps to rectify any SPOFs. The 
contractor error in deleting the active database, compounded by a 
synchronization failure, was a failure that spanned multiple, normally 
redundant, systems and processes.
    Additional mitigations have been put in place to mitigate the risk 
of data deletions/corruption being distributed to all redundant 
databases.

    Question 8. You stated that the FAA is currently working with the 
MITRE Corporation to investigate the causes of the NOTAM outage.\4\ 
What is the status of this work? When do you expect it to be complete, 
and what will be the timeline for implementing any recommendations that 
result?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ Id. at 02:12:35-02:12:54.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer. The MITRE investigation has completed, and briefings to FAA 
leadership are in progress. Once the FAA receives the final report, we 
will review and analyze the recommendations.

    Question 9. To the extent this audit with the MITRE Corporation has 
produced preliminary findings, which of those have been most actionable 
at avoiding similar outages in the future?
    Answer. The MITRE investigation has completed, and briefings to FAA 
leadership are in progress. Once the FAA receives the final report, we 
will review and analyze the recommendations.

    Aviation Workers in Georgia. Georgia is home to a thriving aviation 
industry, including the Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International 
Airport--the world's busiest for passenger traffic. Georgia is home to 
tens of thousands of aviation workers who show up daily to ensure 
passengers get to where they need to go.

    Question 1. How many aviation workers in Georgia were affected by 
this outage? For example, how many aviation workers had to work extra 
hours or take on additional duties to respond to the NOTAM outage and 
associated disruptions? Please describe what steps FAA has undertaken 
to understand the effect of the NOTAM outage on workers.
    Answer. The FAA does not have any direct insight into the impact of 
the outage on aviation workers in Georgia. From an agency perspective, 
the FAA workforce was actively engaged in the NOTAM outage and worked 
around the clock, as the public would expect us to, to ensure that 
operations were brought back to normal as soon as possible. We have 
discussed the impacts of this with our many stakeholders and have 
included them in our status of mitigations and the development of a 
contingency operations capability and procedures to ensure we 
collectively are able to avoid any similar event in the future.

    Question 2. Does current law give FAA the authority and resources 
to compensate passengers or aviation workers directly for its mistakes?
    Answer. The FAA is unaware of any authority or resources to 
directly compensate passengers or aviation workers for an FAA 
``mistake.'' If a party has a valid claim of alleged negligence or 
other tortious conduct of FAA employees, these type of lawsuits are 
controlled by the terms of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 
U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1346, 2671, et seq. Pursuant to the FTCA, before any 
such lawsuit can be filed, the claimant(s) must timely file an 
administrative tort claim with the FAA and otherwise comply with the 
regulations pertaining to such tort claims. The filing of 
administrative tort claims against the FAA is governed by Federal 
regulations 28 C.F.R. Parts 14, 15.

    Type Certification of Unmanned Aircraft Systems. Unmanned Aircraft 
Systems (UAS) are an emerging entrant into the National Airspace System 
(NAS) with potential practical applications such as expedited package 
delivery. The FAA has established a UAS Integration Office responsible 
for leading the agency's efforts to safely integrate UAS into the NAS, 
and I am interested in learning more about the activities and progress 
of the Integration Office.

    Question 1. What, if any, type certifications regarding UAS has FAA 
made to date?
    Answer. The FAA has type certificated a few UAS, and is continuing 
work on several type certification projects using an existing process 
tailored to UAS. Notably, the FAA issued a standard type certificate 
for Matternet in September 2022.

    Question 2. Is there a backlog of type certifications for UAS at 
FAA?
    Answer. While applicants may have specific certification timelines 
in mind, the FAA works certification projects as efficiently as 
possible while maintaining the appropriate considerations for safety.

    Question 3. Are there any staffing and funding challenges that are 
affecting FAA's ability to address type certifications for UAS?
    Answer. The FAA appreciates continued congressional support of our 
certification efforts. At this time, the FAA is sufficiently equipped 
and trained to manage the type certification for UAS.

    Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic Management. The NAS is becoming 
more dynamic through the digitization and automation of aeronautical 
information. The FAA's modernization of its systems, including legacy 
systems such as the Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) system, is a 
critical step towards ensuring the NAS remains safe and efficient, 
particularly as it welcomes new entrants into the airspace.

    Question 1. What efforts has the FAA made to update its 
aeronautical information, including, but not limited to, its NOTAM 
data?
    Answer. Multiple efforts have been completed and more are planned 
to modernize the collection and dissemination of aeronautical 
information-foundational data required for all operations. NOTAM 
Modernization will continue as we are updating the older systems.
    We have made some improvements to the legacy database and functions 
in recent years. Modernization with NOTAM Aeronautical Information 
Management Modernization (AIMM) Segment 2 built the Aeronautical Common 
Service (ACS), which provides an enterprise machine-to-machine 
interface containing integrated aeronautical information over System 
Wide Information Management (SWIM) in the globally harmonized message 
format of AIXM (Aeronautical Information eXchange Model). Combining 
static and dynamic data enables near real-time situational awareness of 
the NAS for all stakeholders.
    The planned AIMM Enhancement 1 is the next phase of this 
modernization plan. The NOTAM System will be transitioned to support 
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) NOTAM standards, 
an enterprise airspace management platform for originating and 
distributing the critical airspace NOTAMs, and finally, providing 
additional filtering and distribution mechanisms for the aeronautical 
information. This phase will also complete the FAA Reauthorization Act 
of 2018 requirements for NOTAM Modernization.

    Question 2. Is the FAA operationalizing drone safety services and 
the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic Management environment? If so, 
how?
    Answer. To establish the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic 
Management (UTM) system, the FAA is developing a Unmanned Aircraft 
Systems (UAS) regulatory and traffic management framework that is 
compatible with the evolution of the technology required to support 
UTM. UTM infrastructure will evolve so that the use of a mature UTM 
ecosystem will support planned commercial operations.
    Section 377 of FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254) 
requires the FAA to develop a process to permit, authorize, or allow 
the use of UTM Services. The FAA is developing a review process for UTM 
services that ensures national airspace system safety and reduces UAS 
risk. This approach is intended to expedite (third-party service 
supplier) approvals in low-risk areas and will allow for test and 
evaluation of standards, technologies, and capabilities. The FAA is 
hoping to launch this system soon and will use information gathered 
through this program to inform policy and decision-making.

    Question 3. What role does the modernization of airspace data 
sources play in the operationalizing of drone safety services and the 
Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic Management environment?
    Answer. The Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management system 
(UTM) is a ``traffic management'' ecosystem for uncontrolled Unmanned 
Aircraft System (UAS) operations that is separate from, but 
complementary to, the FAA's Air Traffic Management (ATM) system. UTM 
development will ultimately identify services, roles and 
responsibilities, information architecture, data exchange protocols, 
software functions, infrastructure, and performance requirements for 
enabling the management of low-altitude uncontrolled drone operations. 
The UTM consists of a group of enterprise systems that exchange data 
with external partners, called UAS Service Suppliers (USSs), for the 
purpose of processing flight authorization requests from individual UAS 
(aka drone) operators. Modernization and shared data will enable near 
real-time situational awareness of the NAS for all stakeholders.

    Remote Identification. Remote identification of drones is one of 
the new technologies and systems that FAA is adopting in order to 
ensure the safe integration of UAS into the NAS. The FAA final 
rulemaking on remote identification requires drones to locally 
broadcast identifying information, though other jurisdictions have 
remote identification standards that allow either local broadcast or a 
network solution.

    Question 1. Are there benefits of a network remote identification 
solution? Why did FAA not include a network solution in its final 
rulemaking on drone remote identification?
    Answer. Though the FAA recognizes that there are potential benefits 
associated with establishing a network of remote ID UAS Service 
Suppliers (USS), the FAA believes that, for the time being and given 
the types of unmanned aircraft operations that are currently allowed, 
the broadcast remote identification solution fulfills agency and law 
enforcement needs to maintain the safety and security of the airspace 
of the United States. The FAA received significant feedback about the 
network requirement identifying both public opposition to, and 
technical challenges with, implementing the network requirements. After 
careful consideration of these challenges, informed by public comment, 
the FAA decided to eliminate the requirement in this rulemaking to 
transmit remote identification messages through an Internet connection 
to a remote ID USS.

    Advanced Air Mobility. Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) envisions an 
aviation transportation system that will use automated aircraft to 
operate and transport passengers or cargo at lower altitudes beyond 
urban environments. The FAA has incorporated AAM into its planning 
efforts and is collaborating with the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) on their AAM National Campaign, yet there is much 
more to be done before adopting AAM into the current aviation 
ecosystem.

    Question 1. Does the FAA have the technical knowledge, tools, and 
appropriate staff to review AAM applicants in a safe and timely manner?
    Answer. Yes. The FAA has the necessary training and technical 
background to review AAM applicants. This is a new type of aircraft and 
the FAA will utilize the safety continuum and leverage existing 
guidance, where applicable, to ensure AAM applicant review is safe and 
timely.
    The FAA has established innovation teams (iTeams) that cover key 
focus areas: aircraft certification, operational certification, 
airspace and air traffic management, vertiports, infrastructure, 
environment, security, community outreach, safety, and people. Many of 
these iTeams are already engaged in activities required for the 
operationalization of AAM including with AAM Original Equipment 
Manufacturers and operators to work through certification and other 
associated processes.

    Question 2. Would the FAA benefit from a dedicated office to 
coordinate the certification and implementation progress of AAM 
applicants into the National Airspace System? If so, what authority 
should this office have?
    Answer. At this time, the FAA has the appropriate organizational 
structure to address AAM applicants. The cross-line of business 
communication plans have been established and we are working at an 
appropriate cadence and structure to bring AAM applicants into the NAS 
in a safe and efficient manner.

    Question 3. What specific steps is the FAA taking in the next 3, 6, 
and 12 months to ensure it will meet the deadline to issue the first 
type certificates for electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) 
aircraft in 2024? Who is in charge of these efforts at FAA?
    Answer. While the FAA is making every effort to work with 
applicants on their type certifications projects in a timely and 
expeditious manner, the FAA does not set timelines for certification. 
The FAA is working to finalize airworthiness criteria, publish a 
Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift operations, 
and refine means of compliance with several applicants.

    Question 4. Will FAA prioritize Letters of Authorization (LOAs) for 
initial AAM operations in National Airspace?
    Answer. The FAA plans to support manufacturers and operators in the 
establishment of their operations programs by coordinating efforts 
during operational certification, including the issuance of any Letters 
of Authorization (LOA). Consistent with the way the FAA engages with 
stakeholders of other aircraft categories, the FAA will work 
collaboratively with AAM manufacturers and operators through training 
and operations certification processes until completion.

    Question 5. Is there a backlog for Part 135 air carrier and 
operator certifications? If so, what is the FAA doing to address this 
backlog?
    Answer. The FAA plans to take a number of actions to assist in 
reducing the backlog for Part 135 certification requests. Efforts 
include redistributing and reprioritizing work within the FAA to assist 
with certification activities, aligning and establishing policy to 
reduce the timeline for certification projects, and partnering with 
industry organizations to explore opportunities for initial screening 
and standardization prior to submission to the FAA.

    Airplane Fuel Efficiency Certification. In June 2022, the FAA 
issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Airplane Fuel Efficiency 
Certification. This proposal aligns with aircraft CO<INF>2</INF> 
emission standards established by the United Nations' International 
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and with Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)'s regulations implementing the ICAO standard. Once this 
rule is adopted, all U.S. aircraft will have to be certified to these 
new standards in order to be delivered to their customers after 2027. I 
know that many U.S. manufacturers of large and small aircraft are 
anxious to have a final FAA rule released as soon as possible in order 
to begin certifying aircraft to the standard.

    Question 1. When will this rule be finalized?
    Answer. On January 11, 2021, EPA published a final rule adopting 
the ICAO standard into U.S. regulations as a new 40 CFR Part 1030. On 
June 15, 2022, in accordance with its requirements under the Clean Air 
Act, the FAA proposed new certification regulations for certain 
airplanes to ensure compliance with EPA standards. The comment period 
for FAA's proposal closed on August 15, 2022, and the FAA received a 
total of sixty-two comments on the rule. The FAA is currently working 
on a final rule, which the FAA anticipates will publish in September 
2023.

    NOTAM Outage and Ground Stop. The NOTAM outage and 2-hour ground 
stop highlighted the sensitivity and vulnerability of our air traffic 
system. I am pleased that we are collectively looking at what needs to 
be done to prioritize and update the NOTAM system; however, I am 
concerned that the NOTAM system is just one of many critical air 
traffic programs that are outdated and at risk of failure. While the 
ground stop during the NOTAM outage was only about two hours, I worry 
about another system failures that could lead to longer operational 
impacts.

    Question 1. Could you please provide an update on the Terminal Flow 
Data Manager, Flow Management Data & Services, En-Route Automation 
Modernization, and other critical programs and modernization efforts?
    Answer. During COVID, the FAA established a new program called Flow 
Management Data and Services (FMDS) to replace the aging Traffic Flow 
Management System. The new FMDS program went from definition by the 
Federal Acquisition Executive (February 2022) to Investment Analysis 
Readiness Decision (January 2023) in just 11 months. The program 
continues in accordance with the FAA's Acquisition Management System 
toward a Final Investment Decision in January 2025. COVID has not 
impacted this program's cost, schedule, or ability to complete the 
required investment analysis work.

    Question 2. What are biggest challenges in strengthening the 
resiliency and reliability of the air traffic system?
    Answer. The agency's ability to strengthen the resiliency and 
reliability of the air traffic system is dependent on maintaining an 
adequate and stable funding stream and long-term authorizations.
    Events such as continuing resolutions, government shutdowns, and 
sequestration, can affect the implementation schedules, thus affecting 
system resiliency and reliability. These events not only directly 
affect program schedules, but they can disrupt Federal hiring and 
retention and affect vendor ability to keep the required skills on 
staff.

    Question 3. Would changes in the Congressional funding structure, 
such as expanding the Airport & Airway Trust Fund (AATF) and extending 
Congressional budget authority longer than a year help the FAA support 
the safety, reliability, and resiliency of our Nation's aviation 
system, including its critical air traffic programs?
    Answer. Congress has provided some flexibility for the FAA's 
budget, including multi-year budget authority, and the President's FY 
2024 Budget request includes robust investment in system modernization. 
We look forward to working with Congress on the next FAA 
reauthorization act to ensure that the FAA has stable and sufficient 
funding in the years to come.

    Question 4. Would streamlining the Federal contract and acquisition 
processes help FAA improve and modernize its air traffic programs and 
systems?
    Answer. The FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS) was formed 
with the flexibilities required to pivot and respond to mission need. 
While these flexibilities are available, we look forward to working 
with Congress on the enactment of a long-term reauthorization, and 
adequate funding for our modernization needs to efficiently and 
effectively field capabilities under AMS.

    Question 5. Does the FAA plan to keep allowing backup systems such 
as WMSCR and AIDAP to continue transmitting NOTAM information while the 
agency updates the primary system, and should air carriers continue to 
invest in connecting to these backup systems?
    Answer. WMSCR will continue to transmit NOTAM information for the 
foreseeable future. The AIDAP system will be sunset as part of the 
NOTAM Modernization effort.

    Question 6. Can you please describe the NextGen Advisory Committee 
(NAC)'s work and how you will ensure that the NAC incorporates industry 
input in order to help FAA fix its foundational legacy systems and 
modernize programs for operational and environmental benefits?
    Answer. The NextGen Advisory Committee (NAC) provides independent, 
consensus-based advice and recommendations to the FAA in response to 
specific ``taskings'' received directly from FAA. The NAC is currently 
engaged with the FAA on several commitments: the Northeast Corridor, 
Surface and Data Sharing, Data Communications, and Performance Based 
Navigation focus areas through the NextGen Joint Implementation Plan. 
For example, the FAA issued NAC Tasking 23-1: National Airspace System 
(NAS) Airspace Efficiencies, requesting advice on identifying and 
leveraging airspace efficiencies. As part of this task, the NAC will 
review current usage of legacy systems and NextGen procedures and 
provide advice on divesting and leveraging efficiencies across the NAS.

    5G. Air carriers have raised concerns regarding the next milestone 
of July 1, 2023, for 5G deployment and Group 3 aircraft. These concerns 
include delays in manufacturing, supply chains, and regulatory 
approval.

    Question 1. Are you aware of the challenges I mentioned for 
manufacturers and air carriers?
    Answer. The FAA is fully aware of the challenges to retrofit. We 
hold regular meetings with airframe manufactures such as Boeing, 
Airbus, Embraer, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the radio 
altimeter manufacturers like Collins, Honeywell, and Thales. We meet 
with the airframe and radio altimeter manufacturers as a group and meet 
with them individually to make sure we understand any challenges to 
completing the retrofit.

    Question 2. Do you anticipate there will be impacts to airline 
operations after July 1?
    Answer. Based on information from the airframe manufacturers and 
the airlines, FAA is estimating that less than 15 percent of U.S. 
domestic registered airplanes will not have completed retrofit on July 
1. The proposed Airworthiness Directive states that airplanes not 
equipped with a 5G C-Band tolerant radio altimeter after July 1, when 
the voluntary wireless mitigations end, will be subject to operational 
restrictions. These potential impacts to airlines operations will 
almost exclusively happen during periods of very low visibility (less 
than one-half (1/2) statute mile) at the destination airport. Some 
operators of these unretrofitted airplanes will not be affected because 
they have chosen not to operate in visibility this low. These 
visibility conditions are very infrequent but it is possible that some 
airlines without suitably equipped 5G C-Band tolerant radio altimeter 
airplanes will have operational impacts.

    Question 3. Do you commit to having full transparency with air 
carriers on the challenges that lie ahead, and will the FAA help make 
adjustments as necessary, so they can continue to transport passengers 
without operational disruption?
    Answer. The primary mission of the FAA is to ensure the safety of 
the National Airspace System (NAS) and the traveling public. When the 
wireless voluntary mitigations around airports end on July 1, airplanes 
without 5G C-Band tolerant radio altimeters will be subject to 
interference resulting in an unsafe condition. To ensure the safety of 
the NAS, the FAA must restrict unretrofitted airplanes from certain 
operations after July 1.

    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Jerry Moran to 
                              Billy Nolen
    Question 1. In December 2017, the bipartisan Modernizing Government 
Technology Act, established the Technology Modernization Fund, which 
provides IT working capital funds to Federal agencies and allows them 
to use savings obtained through streamlining IT systems, replacing 
legacy products, and transition to cloud computing for additional 
modernization efforts. To date, TMF has invested in 35 government IT 
modernization projects across 19 Federal agencies, the largest project 
investment so far being $187 million.

  <bullet> Mr. Nolen, considering the NOTAM modernization goal of 
        transitioning to an entirely virtual platform by 2025, can you 
        tell me if the Department of Transportation and the FAA has 
        considered using the Technology Modernization Fund to improve 
        the NOTAM system? Please explain why or why not.
    Answer. To date, the FAA has limited experience with the use of the 
Technology Modernization Fund. FAA leadership has identified 
opportunities to leverage this fund for selected modernization planned 
activities.
    The Technology Modernization Fund has awarded funds to the FAA for 
a non-NOTAM related project. The FAA's Office of the Chief Information 
Officer submitted a proposal to the Technology Modernization Fund's 
Program Management Office for consideration to modernize 22 
applications hosted in the FAA's Mission Support Operating Environment. 
These applications will be refactored to a Cloud native architecture 
over the course of three years and will be free of technical debt.
    At this time, the FAA has not considered using the Technology 
Modernization Fund to improve the NOTAM system.

  <bullet> Could DOT and FAA better utilize the Technology 
        Modernization Fund to ensure situations like the NOTAM system 
        failure that occurred in January does not occur again?
    Answer. Yes. The Technology Modernization Fund mission may be a 
possible option to help address the agency's growing technical debt.

    Question 2. Mr. Nolen, you have spoken recently about your 
excitement around Advanced Air Mobility. Last Congress, my Advanced Air 
Mobility Coordination and Leadership Act became law, which instructs 
the Department of Transportation to lead a working group comprised of 
members of Federal agencies to provide recommendations on the 
coordination and integration of this new entrant into our civil 
airspace. The recommendations from this working group will be 
instrumental in crafting this year's FAA Reauthorization bill.

  <bullet> Can you provide a status update on the establishment of this 
        interagency group and other concrete steps the FAA is taking on 
        leading the world in the adoption of AAM?
    Answer. In response to the Advanced Air Mobility Coordination and 
Leadership Act, the DOT established the Interagency Working Group 
(IWG), which officially kicked off on February 22, 2023, with a follow-
up working group meeting on March 21-22, 2023. The FAA is playing a key 
role in the IWG to identify cross-agency gaps and activities. Led by 
DOT, the IWG is ensuring an all of government approach to AAM to ensure 
aircraft, air traffic, safety, security, frequency spectrum, 
infrastructure, automation, and other areas of focus, to include areas 
outside of the FAA authority (e.g., electrification and local land use 
issues) related to AAM are being taken into consideration.
    In addition to the IWG, the FAA is creating an ecosystem of 
technologies, systems, processes, and organizational structures that 
will help safely integrate AAM operations in an efficient, sustainable, 
and repeatable manner. To do so, the FAA has established innovation 
teams (iTeams) that cover key focus areas such as aircraft and 
operational certification, airspace and air traffic management, and 
vertiports. In addition to leading research efforts to establish AAM 
standards, the iTeams are developing an implementation plan that will 
contain a Concept of Use for the FAA's vision of AAM operations, as 
well as an Integrated Master Schedule. The agency is also building a 
structured approach to support the expected evolution of AAM. This 
includes preparing for near-term early entry-into-service operations 
based on industry plans, mid-term operations such as the 
operationalization of AAM at a key site in 2028 (Innovate28), and fully 
mature AAM operations.

    Question 3. I am a strong supporter of the FAA contract tower 
program and recognize the essential role of the program in keeping 
small and rural communities safe and connected to the broader aviation 
system. The FAA has proposed to revise the boundaries of the service 
areas for the contract tower program, and I am concerned that the 
proposed realignment could impact aviation safety.

  <bullet> Mr. Nolen, has the FAA conducted a safety risk assessment of 
        the proposed revisions of the contract tower service areas to 
        ensure there aren't any unacceptable or unintended safety 
        consequences?

  <bullet> Since contract towers are operational by nature, should the 
        FAA conduct a safety risk assessment before moving forward with 
        the proposed realignment of the service areas?
    Answer. Safety is of the utmost concern to the FAA. The FAA 
followed all applicable safety management processes in determining the 
new Federal Contract Tower (FCT) contract area boundaries. A safety-
risk assessment was not required as the administrative change does not 
impact the quality of air traffic services at FCT locations. The newly 
established boundaries are an administrative change that only affects 
the organizational structure of the towers and high industry safety 
standards will be maintained.
                                 ______
                                 
      Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ted Budd to 
                              Billy Nolen
    Question 1. Since December 2001, the FAA has restricted flights 
within three miles and 3,000 feet of every major league baseball and 
NFL football stadium during games. But the FAA does not issue NOTAMs 
for these events. Air Traffic Control and electronic flight bag 
applications like ForeFlight must resort to using commercial ticketing 
websites to find out the times for these sporting events. Mr. Nolen, 
how does the FAA expect pilots to comply with these TFRs if they cannot 
get reliable information about the restrictions directly from the FAA?
    Answer. As you noted, shortly after September 11, 2001, the FAA 
began restricting flights within three miles and 3,000 feet of every 
major league baseball and NFL football stadium. The scope is actually 
much greater than that. This action was taken because Congress enacted 
legislation that restricted civil aircraft operations over sporting 
events such as NASCAR, Major League Baseball (MLB), the National 
Football League (NFL), National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) 
Division I Football, and other open-air events containing more than 
30,000 people.
    Contemplating how to effectively implement Congress' direction and 
prior to implementing the first ``Sporting Event'' Temporary Flight 
Restriction (TFR), a determination was made that the FAA NOTAM's system 
would be overwhelmed by the sheer number of events covered under the 
TFR:

        MLB = 4913 (includes possible playoff games), NFL = 589 
        (including playoffs), NCAA Div 1 Football--1,603 (includes bowl 
        games), and NASCAR = 100 (estimated) for a total of up to 7,115 
        individual events that would require a unique TFR each year.

    The TFR contains language that states it is in effect one hour 
prior to the event until one hour after the event. With delays and 
unforeseen occurrences that impact the start and stop times of covered 
events it would be impractical, at best, for the FAA to publish 
individual TFRs accurately.
    This was a discussion item during the development of this 
legislation in 2001.
    Knowing the challenges this legislation placed on the FAA, we 
embarked on an unending outreach campaign to bring awareness to the 
flying public. In that vein, the FAA expects pilots to comply with 
these congressionally mandated protections implemented through the use 
of TFRs. Pilots have the ability to gain awareness by thorough and 
effective preflight planning, which may include planning a flight path 
to avoid a covered event by three miles or being above 3000 feet. 
Additionally, pilots could seek airborne clarity that can be provided 
by local air traffic controllers that are monitoring the airspace.

    Question 2. The FAA has been working to expand the availability of 
Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) and Tower Data Link 
Services (TDLS). As you know, this technology enables pilots to receive 
some ATC clearances without having to speak to a controller on the 
radio. Receiving written clearances saves time and reduces the chance a 
pilot or controller will misstate the clearance. While the equipment 
required to receive these clearances enroute is expensive, nearly every 
pilot has access to a cell phone or tablet. This presents an 
opportunity for every pilot to have an option to receive electronic 
pre-departure clearances before they leave the ground. What is the FAA 
doing to expand the number of airports, TRACONs, and ARTCCs with CPDLC 
and TDLS capabilities (as appropriate), and in particular, those able 
to deliver electronic pre-departure clearances to general aviation 
pilots?
    Answer. FAA has deployed CPDLC and TDLS to 65 towers. We are in the 
process of deploying En Route initial and Full Data Comm capabilities 
to the 20 ARTCCs that will be used to cover the contiguous U.S. 
Currently 11 ARTCCs are using En Route Data Comm capabilities.

    Question 3. Is the FAA developing the capability to receive 
electronic pre-departure clearances from subscription-free services 
(such as Flight Service) that could be accessed from a cell phone or 
tablet?
    Answer. The FAA has been exploring a concept to allow pre-departure 
clearances to be sent to pilots over commercial networks using a 
personal mobile device. The vision is that the service will be 
available to pilots through apps from companies such as flight plan 
service providers. The concept is still several years away from 
implementation. When it is ready for technology transfer to industry, 
the capability will be available for licensing to any service provider 
who wishes to provide the service. The FAA has not taken a position on 
whether the pre-departure clearance capability will be available 
subscription-free or only offered through fee-for-service providers.
