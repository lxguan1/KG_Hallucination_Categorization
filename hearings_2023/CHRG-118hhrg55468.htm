                         TUESDAY, JULY 18, 2023

                  House of Representatives,
               Committee on Small Business,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 9:55 a.m., in Room 
2360, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Roger Williams 
[chairman of the Committee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives Williams, Stauber, Meuser, Van 
Duyne, Salazar, Ellzey, Alford, Crane, Bean, LaLota, Velazquez, 
Phillips, Scholten, Thanedar, Chu, and Davids.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Okay. We are ready to get started. And 
before we get started officially, we are going to say the 
Pledge of Allegiance and a short prayer. Representative Meuser 
will lead us.
    Mr. MEUSER. My honor, Chairman.
    Please bow your heads.
    Let us all appreciate, Dear Lord, the glory and beauty of 
this day. We undoubtedly will face many struggles. In some 
cases, we will disagree. In some cases, we will agree. But give 
us the strength and peace to keep you in mind to work for the 
moral good and perform our patriotic duty to our Constitution 
and our country, the United States of America. Amen.
    Please stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.
    I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of 
America. And to the Republic for which it stands, one nation 
under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Okay. The Committee will now come to 
order.
    A quorum is present, and without objection, the Chair is 
authorized to declare a recess of the Committee at any time.
    As required by House rules, a copy of the legislative 
measures have been made available to Members and the public at 
least 24 hours in advance. Pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and 
House Rule 11, all votes will be rolled to the end of this 
meeting.
    I now recognize myself for opening remarks.
    We welcome everybody here today. And today's markup is here 
to discuss eight bills that address the various needs of Main 
Street America. Frankly put, our nation's small business 
entrepreneurs and innovators have faced some of the strongest 
economic headwinds in recent memory over the past 2 years. Here 
on this Committee, it is our job to be the strongest advocate 
for small businesses as they are at the heart of each of our 
communities and employees of nearly 62 million Americans. That 
is why our work here is so important and why we must get our 
economy back on track and our workforce motivated.
    Furthermore, it is our job to produce policy solutions to 
ensure the federal government is held accountable, especially 
on behalf of the American taxpayer. The contents of these eight 
bills have been thoroughly discussed by our Members. My 
colleagues and I are proud of our hearings, our resulting in 
legislative action to keep and help address the major issues 
facing Main Street America.
    Before us today are bills that address some of the 
shortcomings of the SBA as identified by the Office of 
Inspector General. Further, these bills address regulatory 
burdens, assist veterans in their access to capital, enable 
follow-up guidance on rulemaking and support collaborative 
research for small businesses.
    I want to thank our Members for bringing these bills 
forward as they represent the work and devotion of our 
Committee as a whole, as well as the Ranking Member and her 
staff by working hand in hand with us to come up with 
bipartisan policy solutions to address the issues impacting 
main street.
    I ask unanimous consent for four letters of support for our 
legislation to be entered into the record.
    Without objection it is so ordered.
    So, with that I look forward to today's markup, and I yield 
to the distinguished Ranking Member from New York, Ms. 
Velazquez, for her opening statement.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for 
holding this markup today.
    I am committed to working in a bipartisan manner to enact 
legislation that assists small businesses, as well as conduct 
rigorous oversight of SBA's programs.
    The past 3 years have been extremely challenging for small 
businesses. SBA provided more than $1.2 trillion in pandemic 
relief, which enabled small businesses to navigate the pandemic 
and stay afloat. Today, we are seeing the benefit of that aid. 
Entrepreneurs have started a record number of small businesses 
who have created jobs at a rapid pace. Small firms have paved 
the way for some of the lowest unemployment rates in recent 
times and we got more news, good news last week as annual 
inflation dropped to 3 percent.
    Despite the success of the pandemic relief programs, we 
know bad actors took advantage of the programs. Last week, we 
learned from the IG and SBA the extent of that fraud. And while 
the numbers are vastly different, we must work together to 
recover fraudulent funds and ensure we learn best practices for 
the next global catastrophe.
    That is why I support this legislation to require the SBA 
and OIG to submit quarterly reports detailing the amount of 
fraud.
    I also support legislation requiring SBA to issue clear 
guidance for borrowers, lenders, and financial institutions on 
how to return PPP funds and implement a process for SBA to 
track the returned funds.
    But, our work does not end with the pandemic oversight as 
we have many other challenges facing our small business 
community. That is why I plan to lend my support to the bills 
we are marking up today to help veterans, small contractors, 
and innovators.
    It is important to note that we did not see eye to eye on 
these bills at the beginning of the process, but through hard 
work of the Chairman, bill sponsors, and Committee staff on 
both sides of the aisle we were able to reach a compromise. And 
while I am proud of those achievements, it is disappointing we 
failed to reach an agreement on one bill, but it is my hope 
that we can continue to work through those differences.
    Thank you, and I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you.
    Now, does any other Member seek recognition for the purpose 
of making an opening statement?
    Okay. Seeing none, we will now move to the consideration of 
the first bill.
    H.R. 4666
    The first bill we will mark up today is H.R. 4666, a bill 
to require the SBA OIG to submit quarterly reporters on PPP and 
EIDL fraud introduced by Mr. Bean and Mr. Mfume.
    I now recognize the bill's sponsor, Mr. Bean for a 
statement.
    Mr. BEAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And a very 
good morning to you. And good morning, Small Business 
Committee.
    I am fired up to introduce the PPP/EIDL Fraud Report Act of 
2023, alongside my good friend from Maryland, Mr. Mfume. This 
bill will require the inspector general of the SBA to submit a 
report to Congress every quarter that provides detailed updates 
concerning the ongoing fraud investigations of the PPP and EIDL 
loan program. Most importantly, Members, it will ensure that 
the recently released report of the pandemic loan fraud program 
will not be swept under the rug.
    Specifically, the report shall include the dollar amount of 
all loans covered that were made, the number of new fraud 
cases, suspected fraud cases, the type of fraud identified in 
those cases, and the number of fraud cases resolved to date.
    Members, this stems from the shocking report and the jaw-
dropping meeting that we had last week where the inspector 
general came and talked about the tremendous fraud that is now 
becoming apparent over the COVID program. It included $200 
billion in potentially fraudulent COVID-19 loans that were 
distributed by the SBA. The same report at that meeting, we 
learned that there were more than 250,000 OIG Hotline 
complaints received since the start of the pandemic, and more 
than 90,000 of these cases are suspected to have fraud. It 
represents--are you ready for this? Did you hear it last week? 
I will repeat it again. It is over 100 years of casework. And 
so, we asked the inspector general. He said I am going to climb 
that mountain. Together, we can do it. We want to be kept in 
the loop. And so, 100 years of investigative casework. It only 
happens in crazy town right here in D.C.
    And by the way, one in five, if you are playing along at 
home and you want to do the math, one in five loans are suspect 
of having fraud. One in five. As the inspector general 
continues working on the tens of thousands of investigative 
leads on the fraud, it is important for Congress to be kept up 
to date and that is what this bill will do.
    To close, Mr. Chairman and Members, I want to say to all 
the fraudsters and thieves that stole our money, we are coming 
after you. And so, to come after you, we need to be kept up. We 
are going to prosecute. We are going to get our money back and 
we are going to move forward.
    I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support 
this legislation.
    And Mr. Chairman, I yield back the remainder of my time.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    And now are there any other Members who wish to be 
recognized for a statement on H.R. 4666?
    Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Chairman, I ask to be recognized.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. You are recognized.
    Mr. MEUSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    As we discussed earlier in our hearing last week, the SBA's 
inspector general detailed in his report that $200 billion of 
pandemic loan dollars were potentially obtained fraudulently. 
This number includes $64 billion or 8 percent of PPP and $136 
billion or 44 percent of the EIDL loans. We are thankful for 
the inspector general's work investigating potential fraud in 
these programs, as well as tracking down or recovering those 
who have committed this fraud. This legislation would simply 
require the inspector general to report updated information on 
his ongoing fraud investigations to Congress on a quarterly 
basis. This Committee very much needs to take very seriously 
our role in overseeing the SBA's loan programs, especially the 
fraud that existed in these elite programs and pursue the bad 
actors, bring them to justice, who fraudulently obtained the 
tax dollars of our constituents and the American people. I 
think we all should be very concerned and curious and accept as 
our responsibility what were the entities that committed the 
fraud. Were they particular banks? Were they outliers? Who are 
the criminals? Where are the gaps in the system and what type 
of penalties will take place to send a message that this will 
not be tolerated?
    So, I thank my colleague, Mr. Bean from Florida for his 
leadership on this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support 
its passage, and I look forward to its swift consideration on 
the House floor.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.
    Are there any other Members who wish to be recognized for a 
statement on H.R. 4666?
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chair?
    Chairman WILLIAMS. You are recognized, Ranking Member.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I want to start off by thanking Representatives Bean and 
Mfume for introducing H.R. 4666, which will better enable this 
Committee to fulfill its oversight responsibilities.
    During a worldwide pandemic of impressive proportions in 
which our nation and our world were on the brink of economic 
peril, the SBA stepped in and acted as a lifeline to keep 
America's small businesses to remain open. Through PPP, EIDL, 
and other COVID-related programs, the SBA distributed more than 
$1.2 trillion in economic aid and executed 14 years of lending 
in 14 days.
    During these unprecedented times, the SBA weakened and 
removed its internal controls to disburse funds as quickly as 
possible. Organized criminal syndicates, transnational gangs, 
and other criminals exploited this weakened control in order to 
steal from the American people. The legislation we are 
considering here today will help this Committee better 
understand the data. This legislation requires the SBA 
inspector general to send periodic reports to this Committee 
for the next 2 years with detailed information regarding the 
status of fraud cases, as well as the number of cases that has 
been resolved. While one dollar in fraudulent activity is 
certainly one dollar too many, I think it is important to 
consider how our work here today will help this Committee 
continue our effort to root out fraud where it exists.
    I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I 
yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you, Ranking Member.
    And I now recognize myself to speak in support of this 
legislation.
    I agree with the gentleman from Florida that it is 
essential for Congress to be informed regularly of ongoing 
investigations concerning COVID-19 pandemic lending fraud. The 
need for this bill was demonstrated last week during our 
Committee hearing where we examined two recent reports that 
investigated fraud in the COVID-19 pandemic lending program. 
These contradicting reports, one from the SBA's Office of 
Inspector General and the other from the Small Business 
Administration, raised serious concerns. The SBA Inspector 
General report concluded the SBA disbursed more than $200 
billion in potentially fraudulent loans through pandemic relief 
programs while the SBA reported that the fraud in these 
programs is closer to $36 billion. This massive discrepancy, 
more than $160 billion, demands answers.
    And I greatly appreciate the work that the Office of 
Inspector General has done thus far to begin uncovering the 
extent of this fraud, including appearing before the Committee 
last week to answer questions from our Members about their 
findings.
    I want to again voice my total disappointment that the SBA 
Administrator Guzman declined her invitation to be part of the 
conversation and answer questions about both the IG report and 
the SBA's findings. For such an important topic involving the 
abuse of billions of hard-earned taxpayer dollars, Americans 
deserve answers, they deserve better, which is what this bill 
sets to accomplish.
    I want to thank my colleague from Florida, Mr. Bean, and my 
colleague from Maryland, Mr. Mfume, for introducing this bill. 
I also urge my colleagues to support it.
    If there is no further discussion, the Committee now moves 
to consideration of H.R. 4666. The clerk will report.
    The CLERK. H.R. 4666, to require the Inspector General----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, H.R. 4666 is 
considered as read and open for amendment.
    Does anyone wish to offer an amendment?
    All right. Seeing none, the question is now on adoption of 
H.R. 4666 and ordering it favorably reported to the House.
    All those in favor say aye.
    All those opposed say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. And H.R. 
4666 is agreed to and ordered favorably to the House.
    Mr. BEAN. Mr. Chairman?
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Mr. Bean, for what purpose does the 
gentleman seek recognition?
    Mr. BEAN. Mr. Chairman, for the purpose of requesting a 
recorded vote.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. A recorded vote has been requested and a 
roll call vote is ordered. Pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and 
House Rule 11, further proceedings on this bill are postponed.
    H.R. 4667
    The next bill we will mark up today is H.R. 4667, The 
RECLAIM Taxpayer Funds Act introduced by Ms. Salazar and Mr. 
McGarvey.
    I now recognize the bill's sponsor, Ms. Salazar, for an 
opening statement.
    Ms. SALAZAR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    This bill, The RECLAIM Taxpayer Funds of 2023 requires the 
Small Business Administration, the SBA, to establish processes 
to account for fraudulent and unused PPP loans as recommended 
by the inspector general who we spoke to last week in this 
Committee. The SBA will work with the Treasury Department to 
make sure those funds are returned to the taxpayers now, as 
soon as possible.
    Last year, the inspector general found that the SBA did not 
have the ability to handle fraudulent PPP loans, and today, 
inquiries from borrowers and lenders have gone unanswered. And 
as a result, hard-earned taxpayer dollars in the millions are 
being wasted. This bill addresses this problem immediately by 
requiring the SBA to establish guidance for borrowers and 
lenders to return the money now.
    While the Committee continues to uncover the extent of the 
fraud in the PPP loans, I urge my colleagues to support this 
common-sense bill that is a step towards restoring integrity to 
government lending and dignity back to the taxpayers.
    I want to thank Representative McGarvey from Kentucky in 
joining me on this legislation, and I ask my colleagues to vote 
yes on The RECLAIM Taxpayer Funds Act.
    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    I now recognize the bill's co-sponsor, Mr. McGarvey, for an 
opening statement.
    Okay. Are there any other Members who wish to be recognized 
for a statement on H.R. 4667?
    Okay. Seeing none, I would like to recognize the Ranking 
Member to speak on the bill.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    While Mr. Bean and Mr. Mfume's legislation will enable us 
to oversee the investigation and prosecution of potentially 
fraudulent PPP loans, Representatives Salazar and Mr. 
McGarvey's legislation will help ensure any unused PPP funds 
are properly returned to the American taxpayer. H.R. 4667 
requires the SBA to issue guidance and rules for lenders and 
borrowers on how they are to handle and return unused PPP loans 
to the SBA. Importantly, this legislation directs SBA to issue 
detailed guidance for financial institutions on how they are to 
return PPP funds even if they suspect the borrower acquired the 
funds through fraudulent means. The IGs May report points to 
the SBA lack of guidance, regulations, and ability to account 
for return PPP funds as a central obstacle for lenders and 
borrowers returning unused PPP funds to the administration. The 
lack of guidance and regulation has led to confusion for 
borrowers and lenders, leaving some lenders to even inform 
borrowers that the SBA could not accept funds. This bill 
resolves the problem by codifying the IG's recommendation and 
requiring the SBA to establish clear and detailed guidance. The 
legislation will also require the SBA to establish a process on 
how it will deposit unused funds in the Treasury Department's 
general fund.
    I want to thank Ms. Salazar and Mr. McGarvey for 
introducing this important piece of legislation. I also want to 
thank Chair Williams and his team for incorporating many of our 
suggestions and working with our side in a bipartisan manner. I 
think this has resulted in a better outcome.
    I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you, Ranking Member.
    And I now recognize myself to speak in support of this 
legislation.
    H.R. 4667, a bill to require the SBA administrator to issue 
guidance on the return of PPP funds is a measure to begin 
restoring integrity in government lending. As we learned from 
the inspector general over the last few weeks, of the $1.2 
trillion in taxpayer money that was designed to be disbursed 
into small businesses during the pandemic, at least $200 
billion, or 17 percent, is suspected to have been fraudulently 
disbursed and this is unacceptable. As we continue to dig our 
way through the mountains of data to fully understand the scope 
of this fraud, there are actions that can be taken now to claw 
back some of the potentially fraudulent money, actions which 
have been recommended to the SBA more than once by the 
inspector general.
    In May of this year, the inspector general reported that 
two financial institutions have frozen about $95 million in PPP 
loan deposits that they suspected of fraudulent activity. 
However, these institutions have not returned these taxpayer 
funds to the government because they did not have sufficient 
guidance on how to do so. This problem is long overdue for a 
solution, and I agree with the gentlelady from Florida that her 
bill addresses this problem head-on by requiring the SBA to 
heed the inspector general's recommendations and establish 
proper guidance to accept, process, and account for potentially 
fraudulent and unused PPP loan funds.
    I want to thank my colleague from Florida, Ms. Salazar, and 
my colleague from Kentucky, Mr. McGarvey, for introducing this 
bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4667.
    If there is no further discussion, the Committee now moves 
to consideration of H.R. 4667. The clerk will report.
    The CLERK. H.R. 4667, to require the Administrator----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, H.R. 4667 is 
considered as read and open for amendment.
    Does anyone wish to offer an amendment?
    All right. Seeing none, the question is now on adoption of 
H.R. 4667 and ordering it favorably reported to the House.
    All those in favor say aye.
    All opposed say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. And H.R. 
4667 is agreed to and ordered favorably to the House.
    Ms. SALAZAR. Yeah. I would like to ask for a recorded vote.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. A Member asked for a recorded vote. A 
recorded vote has been requested and a roll call vote is 
ordered. Pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and House Rule 11, 
further proceedings on the bill are postponed.
    H.R. 4480
    The next bill we will mark up is H.R. 4480, the SERV Act 
introduced by Ms. Davids and Mr. Alford.
    I now recognize the bill's sponsor, Ms. Davids, for an 
opening statement.
    Ms. DAVIDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Our nation's veterans are uniquely prepared to become 
entrepreneurs and to lead small businesses. Military experience 
helps to develop highly transferable training and skills that 
have prepared them for leadership roles in the private sector. 
But veterans also face specific challenges in developing and 
starting a business. One significant obstacle being lack of 
access to capital, forcing many small businesses to turn to 
alternative or online lenders which can be more expensive than 
traditional sources.
    And while this challenge exists certainly for all potential 
entrepreneurs and small business owners, it can be especially 
difficult for veterans who often have trouble accruing the 
credit necessary to attract and attain capital.
    The U.S. Small Business Administration works closely with 
the VA and the Department of Defense on several excellent 
programs specifically designed to help our veterans transition 
to civilian life and to entrepreneurship. But as veterans who 
recently testified in this Committee could attest, those 
programs are not always as easy to find as they should be.
    These are problems the SERV Act is working to address. This 
bill would commission a Government Accountability Office report 
on the ability of veterans and reservists to access capital and 
credit which are crucial building blocks to opening a business. 
This report would include analysis on common sources of credit 
and how deployment of our service members affects their 
individual credit. This bill also requires an interagency 
taskforce to develop an action plan for greater outreach of the 
programs that already exist for veterans transitioning into the 
business world. That taskforce would report its findings 
annually to Congress on how the SBA can better support our 
veterans, service-disabled veterans, and our reservists.
    Our service members and their families already sacrifice a 
lot for our country, and it is definitely our duty to support 
them however we can, both during and after their service. And 
while programs through the SBA are just one part of that 
overall support, our veterans should absolutely be able to 
utilize them and grow their businesses to take care of their 
families and contribute to our economy.
    I want to also thank Representative Alford for his 
partnership in introducing this bill and I would encourage my 
colleagues to vote in favor of the SERV Act and support 
successful entrepreneurship for our veterans.
    With that I yield my time. Thank you.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back. And thank you.
    I now recognize the bill's cosponsor, Mr. Alford, for an 
opening statement.
    Mr. ALFORD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I rise today to speak in favor of the Successful 
Entrepreneurship for Reservists and Veterans Act, also known as 
the SERV Act. Representative Davids of Kansas and I are 
cosponsoring this important legislation because our nation's 
veterans have a tremendous impact within our small business 
community. The skills veterans gain in the military make them 
leaders uniquely positioned to start and grow successful 
businesses. Unfortunately, veterans often face barriers when 
starting or growing their business which can feel 
insurmountable at times.
    You know, back in May we were in this very room, and we 
heard from Missouri's own Lieutenant Commander Taylor Burks. We 
heard how the lack of awareness of resources available to 
veterans and access to capital are major barriers and we need 
to change that.
    The SERV Act seeks to identify these barriers and directs 
the interagency task force on veteran small business 
development to create an action plan to improve outreach to 
veterans informing them of available resources. Our veterans 
deserve the SERV Act, and I ask that you vote yes on the SERV 
Act.
    And I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    Are there any other Members who wish to be recognized for a 
statement on H.R. 4480?
    All right. Seeing none, I would like to recognize the 
Ranking Member to speak on the bill.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I just want to thank both Ms. Davids and Mr. Alford for 
calling on GAO, one of the most highly regarded organizations 
in our federal government to produce a fact-based, independent 
report and also requiring the SBA to develop an outreach plan 
to increase awareness of their vital programs. I want to thank 
them and the Chairman and the staff for working on this 
legislation and I urge a yes vote.
    And I yield back my time.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    And let me say H.R. 4480, the Successful Entrepreneurship 
for Reserves and Veterans Act of 2023 ensures our nation's 
veterans and reservists receive the assistance they need when 
they look to start a small business of their own. This 
legislation orders the Government Accountability Office to 
study and report on credit access to veteran and reservist 
small businesses. It also orders the interagency task force on 
veteran small business development to develop and report a plan 
to promote programs to veterans. Our nation's veterans and 
reservists have dedicated their lives to fighting for this 
country and it is vital that we provide them with the resources 
they need to become successful entrepreneurs. I, like many of 
my colleagues, represent military bases in my district and I 
understand just how important it is that these resources are 
accessible.
    I want to thank my distinguished Committee colleagues, 
Representatives Davids and Alford, for introducing and 
cosponsoring this bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
4480.
    If there is no further discussion, the Committee now moves 
to consideration of H.R. 4480. The clerk will report.
    The CLERK. H.R. 4480, to require the Administrator----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, H.R. 4480 is 
considered as read and open for amendment. Does anyone wish to 
offer an amendment?
    Okay. Seeing none, the question is now on adoption of H.R. 
4480 and ordering it favorably reported to the House.
    All those in favor say aye.
    All those opposed say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. And H.R. 
4480 is agreed to and ordered favorably to the House.
    Ms. DAVIDS. Mr. Chairman?
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member is recognized.
    Ms. DAVIDS. I would like to request a recorded vote, 
please.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. A recorded vote has been requested and a 
roll call vote is ordered. Pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and 
House Rule 11, further proceedings on the bill are now 
postponed.
    H.R. 4670
    The next bill we will mark up is H.R. 4670, The Small 
Business Contracting Transparency Act of 2023. It is introduced 
by Ms. Houlihan and Mr. Stauber.
    I now recognize the bill's cosponsor, Mr. Stauber, for an 
opening statement.
    Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak in favor 
of The Small Business Contracting Transparency Act. The Small 
Business Administration is charged with ensuring that only 
eligible firms are participating in the women-owned small 
business contracting program, HUB-Z program, and recently added 
service-disabled, veteran-owned small business program. These 
programs are essential for fostering economic growth and 
providing opportunities for small businesses to thrive. 
Government agencies set aside contract opportunities for small 
businesses in these programs. Delays in certifying or 
recertifying procedures can have devastating consequences for 
these entrepreneurs.
    This is a critical issue that affects small businesses in 
Minnesota and across our nation. Unfortunately, there is 
limited information from the SBA about certification and 
subsequent recertification processes. Additionally, the SBA 
recognizes women-owned small business certifications from 
third-party certifiers which further lessens transparency. The 
Small Business Contracting Transparency Act would bring much 
needed insight into the activities of certifying these firms, 
what fees are being charged, and whether SBA is meeting its 
requirements. By supporting the Small Business Contracting 
Transparency Act, you will not only provide valuable assistance 
to small businesses but also ensure accountability and 
effectiveness in the administration of these programs.
    I ask that we all vote yes on The Small Business 
Contracting Transparency Act, and I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    And I now recognize Ms. Scholten for a statement.
    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    I am proud to speak as an original cosponsor of The Small 
Business Contracting Transparency Act sponsored by 
Congresswoman Houlihan and Congressman Stauber.
    The federal government spends almost half a trillion 
annually on the purchase of goods and services needed for its 
daily operation. Yet, the federal marketplace is a hard space 
to break into, especially for small business owners. The Small 
Business Administration plays an important role in ensuring 
that small businesses owned by women, veterans, and 
economically disadvantaged individuals are able to compete in 
the federal procurement process. In doing so, SBA tracks where 
federal procurement dollars go in the small business 
procurement scorecard. However, the scorecard includes small 
businesses that self-certify, as well as small businesses that 
are formally certified by the SBA. The Office of the Inspector 
General has raised concerns on false self-certification, which 
is why the SBA has made steps towards addressing this issue. As 
of October 2022, SBA's dynamic small business search database 
included almost 150,000 firms that self-certified as small and 
disadvantaged businesses.
    This bill would ensure that the SBA is acquiring up-to-date 
data on where federal procurement dollars are going. It would 
require SBA to provide information to Congress on the 
implementation of contracting certification changes to the 
women-owned small business contracting program, the HUBZone 
program, and the service-disabled, veteran-owned small business 
program. As Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on Contracting 
and Infrastructure, this additional data will inform my 
Subcommittee's work to ensure that all small businesses are 
able to compete in the federal procurement space.
    I urge Members to vote yes on this important legislation.
    Thank you, Chair. I yield back the remainder of my time.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    And are there any other Members who wish to be recognized 
for a statement on H.R. 4670?
    Okay. Seeing none I would like to recognize the Ranking 
Member to speak on the bill.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Chairman Williams. And thank you 
to Ms. Houlihan, Mr. Stauber, and Ms. Scholten for their 
collaboration on H.R. 4670.
    Empowering female entrepreneurs, and specifically boosting 
small women-owned companies in the federal marketplace 
continues to be a top Committee and personal priority. One way 
we do this is by conducting proper oversight of the tools 
available to SBA that are designed to level the playing field 
for women-owned government contracting firms. The WOSB program 
is one such tool and a critically important program. Given the 
delays in setting up the certification program at issue in this 
bill, additional oversight is granted. This legislation will 
help maintain the integrity of the program and ensure it works 
for women business owners as intended. That is why I am pleased 
to support it, and I appreciate the bipartisan work to build in 
the HUBZone and SD/VOSB programs. They face similar issues and 
will benefit from additional oversight as well.
    Thank you. I urge a yes vote and I yield back my time.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    And now I want to recognize myself to speak in support of 
this legislation.
    This bill requires the SBA to provide a report on 
certification activities and contract awards within the women-
owned small business, HUBZones, and service-disabled, veteran-
owned small business programs. It holds the SBA accountable by 
promoting greater transparency and ensures the SBA is doing 
everything it can to make sure that small businesses 
participating in contracting programs are truly eligible and 
that those eligible are being recertified in an adequate amount 
of time and not stuck in the slow, inefficient bureaucratic 
process.
    I want to thank my colleagues from Pennsylvania, Ms. 
Houlihan and my colleague from Minnesota, Mr. Stauber, for 
introducing this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.
    If there is no further discussion, the Committee now moves 
to consideration of H.R. 4670. The clerk will report.
    The CLERK. H.R. 4670, to amend the Small Business Act to 
require----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, H.R. 4670 is 
considered as read and open for amendment.
    Does anyone wish to offer an amendment?
    Seeing none, the question is now on adoption of H.R. 4670 
and ordering it favorably reported to the House.
    All those in favor say aye.
    All those opposed say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. And H.R. 
4670 is agreed to and ordered favorably to the House.
    Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Chair, I would ask for a recorded vote.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. A recorded vote has been asked and 
requested and a roll call vote is ordered. Pursuant to 
Committee Rule 13 and House Rule 11, further proceedings on 
this bill are postponed.
    H.R. 4668
    This next bill we will mark up is H.R. 4668, the POST IT 
Act introduced by Mr. Molinaro and Ms. Scholten.
    I now recognize the bill's sponsor. Mr. Molinaro is not 
here so I will speak for him. He is unable to join us right 
now, but I would ask unanimous consent for his remarks as 
prepared for delivery be entered into the record.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    Now, are there any other Members who wish to be recognized 
for a statement on H.R. 4668?
    All right. Seeing none, I would like to recognize the 
Ranking Member to speak on the bill.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you. And thank you to Mr. Molinaro and 
Ms. Scholten for working together on the introduction of the 
POST IT Act.
    In the last Congress, our Committee approved the One Stop 
Shop Act which required the Office of the National Ombudsman to 
create and maintain a centralized website with hyperlinks to 
small business compliance guidance. The legislation was enacted 
into law and SBA recently launched the website which will make 
it easier for small businesses to comply with federal rules and 
regulations. The bill we are considering today will build upon 
that work by requiring the Ombudsman to publish links to 
guidance documents for rules that have been certified to have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
entities. As we know, guidance documents helped inform small 
businesses of regulations, but they can oftentimes be difficult 
to find. Having a centralized site with hyperlinks to guidance 
documents affecting small businesses will save entrepreneurs a 
significant amount of time.
    I want to thank the sponsors of the legislation for working 
together in a bipartisan way to craft a bill that we can all 
support.
    Thank you and I yield back my time.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Ranking Member yields back.
    I now recognize myself to speak in support of this 
legislation.
    The POST IT Act is an important step in simplifying the 
process for small businesses to comply with agency guidance. 
While allowing great entrepreneurs to spend more time building 
their businesses and less on complying with needless 
regulations main street can succeed.
    I want to thank my colleague from New York, Mr. Molinaro, 
and my colleague from Michigan, Ms. Scholten for introducing 
this bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4668.
    If there is no further discussion, the Committee now moves 
to consideration of H.R. 4668. The clerk will report.
    The CLERK. H.R. 4668, to amend the Small Business Act----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, H.R. 4668 is

    Seeing none, the question is now on adoption of H.R. 4668 
and ordering it favorably reported to the House.
    All those in favor say aye.
    All those opposed say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. And H.R. 
4668 is agreed to and ordered favorably to the House.
    Mr. CRANE. Mr. Chairman?
    Chairman WILLIAMS. For what purpose does the gentleman seek 
recognition?
    Mr. CRANE. I request a recorded vote.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. A recorded vote has been requested and a 
roll call vote is ordered. Pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and 
House Rule 11, further proceedings on this bill are postponed.
    H.R. 4669
    The next bill we will mark up today is H.R. 4669, the DOE 
and SBA Research Act introduced by Mr. LaLota and Mr. Thanedar.
    I now recognize the bill's sponsor, Mr. LaLota, for an 
opening statement.
    Mr. LALOTA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Chairman, as you know, the federal contracting process 
is incredibly complex. So complex in some cases the process 
frustrates and drowns small business from applying for and 
being granted federal contracts. My bill, the Department of 
Energy and Small Business Administration Research Act, aims to 
make the process a bit more simple. The Department of Energy is 
one of the largest procurers of small businesses goods and 
services in the entire government. Through national 
laboratories, small businesses can play a critical role in 
executing DOE's mission.
    My district is home to one of these labs, the Brookhaven 
National Lab, and our lab prioritizes working with small 
businesses. Suffolk County small businesses and Brookhaven have 
created a mutually beneficial relationship based on cooperative 
research and technical assistance. Despite this, far too often 
we hear about the difficulties which small businesses have when 
trying to work with the federal government. In many cases the 
issue begins with agencies not reaching enough small 
businesses. The problems continue with an application process 
that is bureaucratic and frustrating. My DOE and SBA Research 
Act seeks to remedy this problem by requiring the SBA and 
national labs to collaborate to ensure that small businesses 
are better utilized. Working with the government can be a maze, 
and this bill will help bring existing resources and 
opportunities to innovative small businesses.
    I ask that my colleagues vote yes on my bill, the DOE and 
SBA Research Act.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    Are there any other Members who wish to be recognized for a 
statement on H.R. 4669?
    All right. Seeing none, I would like to recognize the 
Ranking Member to speak on the bill.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I am pleased to lend my support to the DOE and SBA Research 
Act led by Representative Nick LaLota and Mr. Thanedar. The 
legislation will allow SBA and DOE to carry out crosscutting 
and collaborative research and development activities. 
Investments in research and development is absolutely critical 
to providing high paying jobs for Americans and ensuring our 
country remains competitive. By increasing coordination between 
the two federal agencies, we will be able to maximize the 
effectiveness of our nation's premier federal research and 
development programs. I applaud Mr. LaLota and Mr. Thanedar for 
their bipartisan work, and I ask my colleagues to support the 
legislation.
    I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Ranking Member yields back.
    And I now recognize myself to speak in support of this 
legislation.
    This Committee continues to hear from small business owners 
how complex, difficult, and burdensome working with the 
government can be. With greater collaboration, SBA and DOE can 
improve the inclusion of small businesses through the mission 
of the national labs. This bill will improve coordination, 
outreach, and utilization of resources to better reach small 
businesses in need of support. Small businesses bring unique 
and invaluable experience to research and development.
    I want to thank my colleagues from New York, Mr. LaLota, 
and my colleague from Michigan, Mr. Thanedar, for introducing 
this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
    And if there is no further discussion, the Committee enow 
moves to consideration of H.R. 4669. The clerk will report.
    Mr. Thanedar, you are recognized for a statement.
    Mr. THANEDAR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Today I am voicing my strong support of the DOE and SBA 
Research Act, recognizing the indispensable role it will play 
in enhancing collaboration among the Small Business 
Administration and the Department of Energy, all in the name of 
improving research and developmental efforts. Let's not forget 
small businesses form the backbone of this country. The 
innovation we stimulate within this sector is not just 
important; it is vital for America's future.
    This legislation does not simply propose research 
collaborations. It carves a path for our small businesses to 
spearhead progress. This act goes one step further. It mandates 
a collaborative report within 2 years of its enactment. This is 
not just a bureaucratic requirement; it is an essential stride 
towards maintaining the transparency and accountability we owe 
to the people. This report will empower us to monitor, and 
comprehend the effectiveness of our research collaborations, 
providing us with the opportunity to revise and refine 
strategies as necessary.
    I am excited. I am a researcher myself having authored an 
SBIR grant that I won when I was an entrepreneur running my 
research-based business. So, I am excited. I hope you share my 
enthusiasm at the prospect of the growth and broadening of 
technical capabilities that the DOE and SBA Research Act 
promises to bring to our agencies. But let's always keep sight 
of the ultimate goal of this legislation, creating high paying 
jobs for our fellow Americans and safeguarding our nation's 
competitive edge on the global stage. Remember, this is not 
just about legislation. It is about our future. It is about 
empowering our workforce and about asserting and maintaining 
our role as a beacon of technology and innovation in a world 
that looks to us for leadership.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    Now, if there is no further discussion, the Committee now 
moves to consideration of H.R. 4669. The clerk will report.
    The CLERK. H.R. 4669, to provide for department----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, H.R. 4669 is

    Does anyone wish to offer an amendment?
    Okay. Seeing none, the question is now on adoption of H.R. 
4669 and ordering it favorably reported to the House.
    All those in favor say aye.
    All opposed say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it and H.R. 4669

House Rule 11, further proceedings on the bill are postponed.
    H.R. 4671
    The next bill we will mark up is H.R. 4671, a bill to 
reform corrective action reports introduced by Ms. Gluesenkamp 
Perez and Mr. Meuser.
    I now recognize the bill's sponsor, Ms. Gluesenkamp Perez 
for an opening statement.
    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Thank you, Chairman Williams, for 
the opportunity. And thank you, Representative Meuser, for 
leading this effort with me.
    The SBA is tasked with ensuring that small businesses are 
given a fair shot at competing for federal contracting dollars. 
These federal contracts can be an incredible financial 
opportunity for our nation's entrepreneurs, and Congress has 
established goals to award a percentage of all prime and 
subcontracts to women-owned small businesses, small, 
disadvantaged businesses, service-disabled, veteran-owned small 
businesses, and HUBZone certified small businesses.
    When federal agencies do not meet these established small 
business goals, they are required to provide SBA with a 
corrective action plan that details the steps that the agency 
will take the next year to meet the unmet goals down the line. 
Many of these reports contain valuable information about the 
actions federal agencies are taking and intend to take to meet 
their small business contracting goals. But these reports are 
not standardized across agencies. In fact, many of them do not 
contain any oversight or accountability mechanisms at all for 
agencies that fail to meet their small business goals.
    My bill will correct these discrepancies across federal 
agencies by requiring all agencies to include information in 
these reports that will provide clarity about small businesses' 
participation as federal contractors and will hold the agencies 
accountable for hitting their small business benchmarks. I am 
grateful for Mr. Meuser's partnership on this bill, and I am 
looking forward to the Committee's support.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    Mr. Meuser is unable to join us right now, but I ask 
unanimous consent for his remarks as prepared for delivery 
being entered into the record.
    Without objection, so moved.
    Are there any other Members who wish to be recognized for a 
statement on H.R. 4671?
    Okay. Seeing none I would like to recognize the Ranking 
Member to speak on this bill.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Chairman Williams.
    I am proud to support this bipartisan work by Ms. Marie 
Gluesenkamp Perez and Mr. Meuser on H.R. 4671 to give us the 
reporting necessary to hold federal agencies accountable for 
their efforts to grow small business success within the federal 
procurement marketplace.
    Many federal agencies meet or exceed their annual small 
business goal in certain categories. Many others do not. And 
most are unable year after year to ensure that women-owned 
businesses, HUBZone designated businesses, and businesses run 
by service-disabled veterans receive sufficient contracting 
opportunities. When they fail to meet their goals, agencies are 
required to tell SBA how they will improve. But then they move 
on and the next year they do it again without any oversight of 
the previous proposal. The changes in this bill hold agencies 
accountable by requiring them to tell SBA first if they did 
what they said they would do; and second, what happened as a 
result. And if it works, SBA will make that information 
available to us, to the administration and to other agencies so 
the proven methods can be shared and replicated. That is why I 
am pleased to support the bill and I appreciate the bipartisan 
work of the Committee to move it forward today.
    Thank you and I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Ranking Member yields back.
    And I now recognize myself to speak in support of this 
legislation.
    Declining participation of small businesses in the 
government contracting space is a major concern for this 
Committee. While more dollars than ever before have gone to 
small businesses, the number of small businesses winning 
contracts has continued to decline. This bill in part seeks to 
include additional reporting data to get a better picture of 
why this is occurring.
    I want to thank my colleague from Washington, Ms. 
Gluesenkamp Perez, and my colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. 
Meuser, for introducing this bill. I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill.
    And if there is no further discussion, the Committee now 
moves to consideration of H.R. 4671. The clerk will report.
    The CLERK. H.R. 4671, to amend the Small Business----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, H.R. 4671 is 
considered as read and open for amendment.
    Does anyone wish to offer an amendment?
    Seeing none, the question is now on the adoption of H.R. 
4671 and ordering it favorably reported to the House.
    All those in favor say aye.
    All those opposed say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. And H.R. 
4671 is agreed to.
    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Mr. Chair? Mr. Chair, I ask for a 
recorded vote.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. A recorded vote has been requested and a 
roll call vote is ordered. Pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and 
House Rule 11, further proceedings on this bill are postponed.
    H.R. 3995
    The final bill we will mark up today is H.R. 3995, The 
Small Business Regulatory Reduction Act introduced by Ms. Van 
Duyne.
    I now recognize this bill's sponsor, Ms. Van Duyne, for an 
opening statement.
    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    I have heard from countless small business owners back at 
home in North Texas, but also in this Committee as well as in 
field hearings that we have had across the country in Ways and 
Means. We have had witnesses hold up binders full of 
regulations that they must comply with from this administration 
and the message they tell us is clear--the businesses are 
drowning in regulatory red tape. I hope that my colleagues from 
both sides of the aisle can agree with me when I say that the 
House Committee on Small Business is committed to prioritizing 
the needs of our nation's job creators and their employees. My 
bill builds off the success of a Trump era policy which 
required two federal regulations to be rescinded for each new 
one issued. It is unfortunate that one of President Biden's 
first actions was to repeal this effective regulatory reduction 
act.
    According to a recent report, the Biden administration has 
added approximately $375 billion in regulatory costs per year. 
If you include his push to release and reduce student loan 
fees, that number goes up to $617 annually in costs.
    Mr. Chairman, I seek unanimous consent to enter into the 
record the Committee to Unleash Prosperity's report titled 
Burden is Back, comparing regulatory costs between Biden, Trump 
and Obama.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection.
    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you very much.
    My bill will stop the unelected bureaucrats from continuing 
to inflict overreaching regulations on our small businesses. 
Specifically, my bill will require the SBA to ensure that for 
each fiscal year the cost of their own rulemaking is not 
greater than zero dollars. Further, it requires the SBA to 
publish a report on regulations issued by other federal 
agencies that impact small businesses. To be clear, this bill 
is not preventing agencies from adding additional regulations 
that are necessary and could improve small businesses. What it 
is doing is saying they can no longer continue to put layer 
upon layer of these regulatory burdens on our small businesses.
    I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    Are there any other Members who wish to be recognized for a 
statement on H.R. 3995?
    Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Chair?
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Recognized.
    Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in favor of H.R. 
3995, the Small Business Regulatory Reduction Act, a crucial 
piece of legislation that impacts small businesses including 
those in Minnesota. During the Trump administration, our 
government adopted the principle of one in, two out by 
repealing two regulations for every new one introduced. It 
created an environment that promoted economic growth and 
empowered small businesses to thrive.
    Under the current administration, this policy has been 
rescinded and replaced with an overregulation policy that has 
imposed nearly $360 billion in new regulatory costs on small 
businesses. Minnesota is known for its vibrant small business 
community, but the crushing regulatory policies implemented by 
this administration, paired with exorbitantly high inflation 
from their spending habits has left our small businesses across 
the nation struggling.
    By reducing excessive regulations, we will counter the 
actions of this administration, provide a favorable environment 
for small businesses to flourish, and reverse the economic 
trajectory of this country. The Small Business Regulatory 
Reduction Act requires the Small Business Administration to 
ensure that any new regulations from their agency does not 
impose a cost on small businesses. Additionally, it mandates 
that the SBA report on regulations issued by other federal 
agencies that directly impact small businesses. We recognize 
the vital role small businesses play in our economy and 
acknowledge their potential for growth and success. This bill 
is a step forward in promoting fairness, accountability, and 
responsible governance. It is essential that we support this 
bill to ensure the success and vitality of small businesses not 
only in Minnesota but all across the nation.
    I urge you all to join me in voting yes on H.R. 3995, the 
Small Business Regulatory Reduction Act. So let us stand 
together in empowering our small business community and 
fostering an environment that nurtures innovation, job 
creation, and economic prosperity. And I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    Are there any other Members who wish to be recognized for a 
statement on H.R. 3995?
    All right. Seeing none, I would like to recognize the 
Ranking Member to speak on this bill.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Throughout my tenure on the Committee, I have tried very 
hard to work with my colleagues on both sides to put forth 
thoughtful bipartisan bills that will make life easier for 
small business owners. Today, we are considering a bill that 
will drive a wedge between the Members of this Committee who 
are all committed to helping small businesses. This bill 
mandating a zero or negative regulatory budget for SBA may 
sound good on the surface but it will have the practical effect 
of limiting the SBA from issuing any rules. As written, it will 
be incredibly difficult for SBA to adhere to it. Unfortunately, 
I will not be able to lend my support to the Small Business 
Regulatory Reduction Act. Everyone on this Committee wants to 
lessen the burden of regulations on small businesses but this 
bill falls short, and it will have the practical effect of 
preventing the agency from issuing regulations to benefit small 
businesses. Because of the unintended consequences of the bill, 
I am opposed to the bill as drafted.
    Thank you, and I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Ranking Member yields back.
    And I now recognize myself to speak in support of this 
legislation.
    H.R. 3995 is a win for Main Street America. As an advocate 
for small business, the last thing the SBA should be doing is 
requiring them to be spending their hard-earned dollars on 
complying with their burdensome regulations and rules. This 
legislation is common sense and should pass this Committee with 
broad bipartisan support.
    I want to thank Ms. Van Duyne for her work on this 
legislation and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
    If there is no further discussion, the Committee now moves 
to consideration of H.R. 3995. The clerk will report.
    The CLERK. H.R. 3995, to require the Administrator----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, 3995 is considered as 
read and open for amendment.
    There is an amendment in the nature of a substitute at the 
desk. The amendment has been pre-distributed to all Members. 
The clerk will report the amendment.
    The CLERK. Amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 
3995----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, the amendment is 
considered as read and the substitute will be considered as 
base text for the purpose of further amendment.
    I now recognize Ms. Van Duyne for a statement on her 
amendment.
    Ms. VAN DUYNE. My amendment makes conforming changes to 
ensure the bill complies with 1-18-4 protocols.
    And I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    Do any other Members wish to be recognized for a statement 
on the amendment?
    Okay. If none, does anyone wish to offer an amendment?
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman?
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Ms. Velazquez will seek recognition.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. I have an amendment at the desk.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. For what purpose does the Ranking Member 
seek recognition? Okay, there is an amendment at the desk. The 
amendment has been pre-distributed to all Members.
    The clerk will designate the amendment.
    The CLERK. Amendment to the amendment in the nature of a 
substitute to H.R. 3995 offered by Ms. Velazquez. Strike 
section----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, the amendment is 
considered as read. Ranking Member Velazquez is recognized to 
explain her amendment.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The bill as written limits the ability of SBA to issue any 
sort of regulation even if the benefits outweigh the costs. SBA 
needs to issue regulations to update existing programs, issue 
disaster declarations, and even reduce recordkeeping 
requirements. This bill fails to define rules and explain which 
rules will be covered by a regulatory budget. Agencies may be 
able to estimate the cost of a regulation, but they do not have 
hard data on the costs that are imposed. It will require the 
agency to make assumptions that could turn out to be incorrect. 
There is nothing in the bill that clarifies how the agency is 
to implement a regulatory budget and is therefore impractical. 
Let's distill this issue into a real-world scenario. No small 
businesses will fail to upgrade a piece of their equipment if 
it only focuses on the cost. Small businesses are savvier than 
this bill implies, and they look at the whole picture, cost and 
benefit. I cannot support this bill because it could bring 
SBA's rulemaking to a halt and in turn limit its ability to 
improve its program and services. To that end, my amendment 
will strike the regulatory budget sections of the bill that are 
not workable and call for the most appropriate office, the 
Office of Advocacy, to report on the costs and benefits of 
rules to small businesses. After the report is issued, we will 
have a better understanding of the impact a regulatory budget 
will have on small businesses.
    I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield. 
Yeah, that will be it, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Ranking Member yields back.
    And does anyone else wish to be recognized for a statement 
on Ms. Velazquez's amendment?
    Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk 
as well.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Recognized.
    Mr. PHILLIPS. Oh, I am sorry. Oh, it is on hers. I am 
sorry. Forgive me.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Okay. Does anybody wish to be recognized 
for a statement on the amendment by Ms. Velazquez?
    Okay. Seeing none, I now recognize myself for a statement 
on Ms. Velazquez's amendment.
    While I appreciate this amendment recognizing agencies 
should be doing cost benefit analyses on their proposed rules, 
I am going to have to oppose the amendment because it 
undermines the intention of the congresswoman's bill. The 
purpose of the underlying legislation is to ensure agencies 
think twice before they continue to burden small businesses 
with new regulations. If they want to have a new rule that is 
going to be costly for businesses to comply, they must cut 
other regulations in order to pay for it. Businesses should not 
have to continually build increased compliance costs into their 
budget. The American Action Form tracks how much regulations 
have cost the private sector, and since President Biden took 
office, the estimated cost is over $375 billion dollars. This 
is not sustainable. We need to provide regulatory relief for 
small businesses and the underlying bill would begin to do just 
that. Again, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment 
proposed by the Ranking Member.
    The question is now the Amendment 1 to H.R. 3995 offered by 
Ranking Member Velazquez.
    All those in favor say aye.
    All those opposed say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the noes have it. The 
amendment is not agreed to.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. I would like to request a recorded vote.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. A recorded vote has been requested and a 
roll call vote is ordered. Pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and 
House Rule 11, further proceedings on the amendment are 
postponed.
    Does anyone else wish to offer an amendment?
    Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Chairman, I now have an amendment at the 
desk.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. For what purpose does the gentleman--
okay, now there is an amendment at the desk by Mr. Phillips. 
This amendment has been pre-distributed to all Members.
    The clerk will designate the amendment.
    The CLERK. Amendment to the amendment in the nature of a 
substitute to H.R. 3995 offered by Mr. Phillips of Minnesota.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, the amendment is 
considered as read.
    Mr. Phillips is recognized to explain his amendment.
    Mr. PHILLIPS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And let me associate myself with your remarks, ``That 
agencies should think twice before burdening small businesses 
with additional regulation.'' I do agree. I have owned a number 
of small businesses and understand firsthand. Let me tell you 
how overly burdensome regulation is bad for business. I think 
we all agree with that. Small enterprises often lack the 
resources to comply with directives from the federal 
government, especially compared to their larger competitors. 
And as Members of this Committee, it is critical that we 
advocate for the many millions of small businesses across the 
country and that includes being mindful of the impact of 
federal regulation on small business.
    So, I want to say I share common ground with you, Mr. 
Chairman, and my friend, Ms. Van Duyne, the author of the 
legislation. Where I disagree is that I believe it is far too 
blunt and rigid and would prove to be somewhat 
counterproductive to the intentions and the interests of small 
business. I think the narrower requirements of the proposed 
small business regulatory budget will hamstring the SBA in 
implementing even the most common-sense regulations, ultimately 
preventing the agency from carrying out its core mission. That 
is why I filed this amendment which proposes just a few 
practical changes that I think would provide a more measured 
approach to the matter at hand. It would require the SBA to 
simply ensure that the costs of its regulations do not exceed 
their benefits. Consistent with the stated goal of the 
legislation, the provision would prevent SBA rule makers from 
cutting into the bottom line of small businesses but calculate 
their impact on a more thoughtful and comprehensive way. Too 
many, I believe, characterize regulation as inherently negative 
but I believe that attitude is an oversimplification of the 
issue. To be sure, overregulation is bad but appropriate 
regulation I think we can all agree is essential. So, if we are 
going to measure the impact that regulations have on small 
business, we have to consider more than just half the equation. 
And I will just give you an example. Back to the early days of 
COVID-19 when we came together and passed the CARES Act and the 
all-important paycheck protection program. After the program 
was established, SBA issued an interim final rule to implement 
it. This rule technically imposed minor costs on small 
businesses through its recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements. But as I would like to think each of us on this 
Committee would agree, the benefits of the PPP program far, far 
outweighed those costs. But under the proposed rule before us, 
or legislation, the SBA's April 2020 rule for PPP would have 
been subject to the strict net zero cost requirement, meaning 
that the SBA would have had to find other regulations to cut in 
order to offset the cost of this essential rule even though the 
impact was clearly going to be overwhelmingly beneficial for 
small businesses in the country. Imposing this sort of 
requirement on SBA during the pandemic would have wasted 
valuable time and energy when our country and economy needed it 
most. Simply put, considering costs without benefits to me is 
nonsensical. My great-grandfather used to tell me, Dean, price 
is but one component of value. And I think that applies in this 
case as well.
    My amendment also offers an exemption for regulations 
issued during periods of national emergency and regulations 
that address fraud, waste, and abuse. Let me say it again. It 
would provide an exemption for regulations that address fraud, 
waste, and abuse. We need not look any further than just times 
of collective desperation when a future pandemic may come, 
armed conflict or other types of crises, we have to give the 
SBA the ability to act quickly and decisively when small 
businesses are facing great challenge.
    And when it comes to protecting the integrity of the SBA 
programs, we need not look further than last week's hearing 
with the Inspector General. When it comes to protecting the 
integrity of the SBA programs, we need not look further than 
last week's hearing with the inspector general to recognize the 
bipartisan consensus towards rooting out fraud, waste, and 
abuse at the SBA. I think all of us on this Committee want to 
see the SBA be better stewards of our taxpayer dollars. So, if 
the agency wants to issue a rule that would strengthen its 
internal controls or enforcement capabilities, we cannot let 
proposals like this underlying legislation stand in the way.
    Let me end by urging my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to support this amendment which would, I think, improve 
the legislation. The Committee has a long, proud history of 
bipartisanship and I think it would be more productive to put 
our heads together and find common ground rather than push this 
response to an issue that so many of us care deeply about.
    And let me just close by reading the amendment if I can 
find it, which I cannot. Here it is. Just very quickly.
    ``The Administrator of the Small Business Administration 
shall ensure that the costs of the small business regulatory 
budget for a fiscal year do not exceed the benefits except with 
respect rules relating to eliminating fraud, waste, or abuse, 
or in a fiscal year during which a national emergency is 
declared by the president under the National Emergencies Act.'' 
Those are the simple modifications.
    With that, Mr. Chairman, I ask for your support and yield 
back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    Does anyone else wish to be recognized for a statement on 
Mr. Phillips's amendment?
    Mr. Bean, you are recognized.
    Mr. BEAN. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I did not 
think I would talk but I do want to talk because I want to tell 
everybody the official title of this bill is the Small Business 
Regulatory Reduction Act. That is the official title.
    Let me give you the unofficial title. It is The Enough Act. 
Enough. Small business owners are saying enough. Because if you 
are playing along at home and keeping score, I just happen to 
have the score of what our current administration has loaded up 
on small business just in the past, what, 2-1/2 years since he 
has been in office, 375 billion. Three hundred seventy-five 
billion of new regulations that has been just dumped on the 
backbone of small America. Small business America is 
struggling. And anybody that has run a small business know even 
in an ideal situation it is hard, but when government is 
constantly putting barriers and new costs and expenses in your 
way it is a miracle, they survive at all.
    So today, let's pass the Enough Act, but let's not put a 
big loophole in there to give this administration just another 
excuse. That is what they want. They want another excuse, a 
loophole to continue to load up that big number that I have 
already given you. So, let's say enough. Let's say enough and 
pass this bill without any additional loopholes so our small 
businesses can get back to what they do best--invest, grow, and 
be Main Street America.
    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    Does anyone else wish to be recognized for a statement on 
Mr. Phillips's amendment?
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman?
    Chairman WILLIAMS. I recognize Ranking Member.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. I support the amendment being offered by Mr. 
Phillips. It is vitally important that we look at both the 
costs and the benefits of rulemaking, as well as provide an 
exemption in the event of natural disaster. Most importantly, 
many of the regulations issued by SBA are necessary to 
safeguard taxpayers' dollars against waste, fraud, and abuse, 
and to preserve public confidence. My colleagues, we cannot 
have it both ways. We cannot. Here we are. We passed a bill 
today, the RECLAIM Taxpayer Funds Act. Guess what? It will 
require for SBA to issue guidance and regulations. So, the SBA 
could say that they will not implement this bill that we passed 
today because it does not fit into their regulatory budget. So 
be aware and be careful what you are calling for here today. 
SBA prioritizes small businesses and seeks to limit the 
regulatory burden for small employers. We must not limit their 
ability to make improvements to its program and that is why I 
support the amendment offered by Mr. Phillips.
    Mr. Chairman, yeah. That is it.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. You yield back?
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Yes, I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Does anyone wish to be recognized for a 
statement?
    Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Chair?
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Mr. Stauber?
    Mr. STAUBER. Just real brief comments.
    We are dealing with rulemaking by the SBA, not legislating 
from Congress to House, both the House and the Senate and the 
president. This is rulemaking from the SBA.
    I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    Anyone else recognized for a statement?
    All right. Seeing none I want to say, again, I appreciate 
everybody's remarks.
    I now recognize myself to speak against this amendment.
    At any given time, there are several presidentially 
declared national emergencies in effect. For instance, 
Executive Order No. 12978 was signed by President Clinton in 
October of 1995, and it invoked the National Emergencies Act 
cited in the Phillips Amendment to create a list of 
specifically designated narcotics traffickers that banks and 
credit units could not do business with. This is a national 
emergency that will probably live in perpetuity which would 
have the effect of rendering this entire bill moot. As such, we 
should reject the amendment. I urge all my colleagues to oppose 
this amendment.
    Now, the question is now on the Amendment 2 to H.R. 3995 
offered by Mr. Phillips.
    All those in favor say aye.
    All those opposed say no.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I would like to request a 
recorded vote.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Okay. A recorded vote has been requested 
and a roll call vote is ordered. Pursuant to Committee Rule 13 
and House Rule 11, further proceedings on the amendment are 
postponed.
    Does anyone else wish to offer an amendment?
    Ms. DAVIDS. Mr. Chairman?
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Ms. Davids is recognized.
    Ms. DAVIDS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Okay. The amendment has been pre-
distributed to all Members.
    The clerk will designate the amendment.
    The CLERK. Amendment to the amendment in the nature of a 
substitute to H.R. 3995 offered by Ms. Davids in Section 2, an 
insert----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The amendment is considered as read.
    Ms. Davids is recognized to explain her amendment.
    Ms. DAVIDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    As Members of Congress, we have an obligation to ensure 
that small businesses across the country are supported and not 
hurt by regulatory guardrails. While some rules may be onerous 
for small firms and small companies, many provide immense 
benefits to these main street companies. And I do fear that the 
underlying piece of legislation that we are discussing may 
inadvertently fail to adequately consider how the Small 
Business Administration can support these companies, 
particularly our veteran-owned businesses and those promoting 
general workforce development.
    As of 2018, veterans owned nearly 2 million businesses in 
this country, employing over 5 million folks nationally. Those 
businesses recorded $1.3 trillion of sales that year boosting 
local economies across the entire country from coast to coast 
and certainly in the Midwest. Small businesses invest locally, 
create innovative jobs, teach folks new skills, and revitalize 
communities. And we need to make sure that regulations worked 
to unleash the true power of small businesses instead of 
handcuffing them with cumbersome rules passed by Congress.
    My main concern with this legislation is that it would only 
consider the costs of regulations and not the benefits for 
small businesses. My amendment is simple, but the cost and 
benefits should be considered. It would exclude SBA rules that 
promote workforce development or that benefit veteran-owned 
businesses from the effects of the underlying legislation. This 
will help former servicemembers start, operate, and grow their 
businesses. And it will ensure that we properly tackle 
workforce development challenges that our small businesses and 
employers are facing nationally.
    I hope that everyone here will vote in favor of my 
amendment to help improve this piece of legislation.
    Thank you, and I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    Does anyone else wish to be recognized for a statement on 
Ms. Davids's amendment?
    Okay. Seeing none----
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman?
    Chairman WILLIAMS. I would like to recognize the Ranking 
Member to speak on this amendment.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you.
    I applaud Ms. Davids for offering an amendment to carve out 
veterans, service-disabled veterans and rules that promote 
workforce development from a regulatory budget. Over the course 
of the past 2 years, we have heard from numerous business 
owners about the benefits of workforce programs. They help 
businesses find skilled workers and prepare Americans for a 
better future without requiring individuals to make substantial 
financial investment in their future. We have also heard from 
countless veterans about the importance of SBA programs to 
their small businesses. We continually ask SBA to do more with 
less and programmatic regulatory enhancements are a part of 
addressing the very needs of veterans or providing workforce 
development resources all across the country. A regulatory 
budget will have the practical effect of grinding SBA 
rulemaking to a halt. I support this exemption for our nation's 
veterans and for rules that promote workforce development and 
thank Ms. Davids. Put simply, we owe a lot to our nation's 
veterans and cannot take any chances with the unintended 
consequences a regulatory budget will have at SBA. Thank you.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Ranking Member yields back.
    And I now recognize myself to speak against this amendment.
    I oppose this amendment because there seems to be a 
misunderstanding on how to help Main Street America. If we want 
to help our job creators, we need to create a business-friendly 
environment, so they grow and expand their operations. The 
gentlewoman's amendment seems to say to pass a new regulation 
that imposes a cost, you must first find a different regulation 
to repeal so we are not compounding these expenses on small 
business. So, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
    Now the question is the Amendment 3 to H.R. 3995 offered by 
Ms. Davids.
    All those in favor say aye.
    All those opposed say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the noes have it.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I would like to request a 
recorded vote.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Okay. A recorded vote is requested, and 
a roll call vote is ordered. Pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and 
House Rule 11, further proceedings on the amendments are 
postponed.
    Does anyone else wish to offer an amendment?
    Ms. CHU. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Okay. There is an amendment at the desk 
from Ms. Chu. This amendment has been pre-distributed to all 
Members.
    The clerk will designate the amendment.
    The CLERK. Amendment to the amendment in the nature of a 
substitute to H.R. 3995 offered by Ms. Chu.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The amendment is considered as read.
    Ms. Chu is recognized to explain her amendment.
    Ms. CHU. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to H.R. 3995, 
The Small Business Regulatory Reduction Act. The underlying 
bill would prohibit the Small Business Administration from 
implementing any new regulations that might incur a cost on 
small businesses even if those regulations might have important 
benefits for small businesses; benefits which many times more 
than offset those costs. We all know that our most underserved 
small businesses, like those located in rural areas and those 
owned by women and minorities all too often struggle accessing 
the resources critical to starting and growing a business like 
capital and contracting opportunities. It is a core purpose of 
this Committee to close this gap in opportunity and resources 
for those underserved small businesses. And I have been proud 
to work towards this goal with many colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle.
    But we also rely on the SBA to be a partner in closing this 
gap and rulemaking can be a critical tool that they use to do 
this. But unfortunately, if left unchanged, this bill would 
effectively prevent the SBA from engaging in new rulemaking 
even if the proposed rule would have significant benefits for 
the disadvantaged small businesses most in need of assistance. 
My amendment would fix this by providing an exception to ensure 
that SBA is able to create new rules that will specifically 
help rural small businesses, women-owned firms, and those owned 
by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals which 
includes Black, Hispanic, Native, and Asian Pacific Americans 
and other minorities and any other disadvantaged individuals.
    I urge strong support for my amendment, and I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    Does anyone else wish to be recognized for a statement on 
Ms. Chu's amendment?
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman?
    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Chairman?
    The CLERK. Ms. Van Duyne.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Ms. Van Duyne?
    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    You know, thoughtful regulations can be very beneficial but 
too often than not what we have seen is excessive regulations. 
They stifle businesses, they burden them with additional costs, 
and in some cases, they force them to lay off people or even 
shut their businesses.
    Now, does anybody remember the hearing where we had the 
witness who was a small business owner and he held up a 4-inch, 
3-ring binder. And he said if you pass this regulation this is 
going to cost me over $100,000 a year. I am going to be forced 
to shut down. I, unlike larger businesses, do not have full-
time staff that handles regulations. This will make me go to a 
halt. We will have to lay people off and possibly shut our 
doors.
    I had not seen businesses come before this Committee and 
say, you know what? We need more regulations. This is awesome. 
What we have seen is small businesses over and over again beg 
for our help to shrink regulations because they are killing 
them. Again, H.R. 3995 does not prevent the SBA from enacting 
additional regulations. It does not prevent it from updating 
regulations or introducing beneficial regulations. But what it 
does do is it forces it to be disciplined. It forces it to 
review old, outdated regulations or restrictions or duplicative 
regulations that do nothing but add costs, layer more burdens 
on small businesses, and increase the size of bureaucracy.
    We have heard from the Ranking Member that everyone here 
wants to lessen the burden on small businesses. When are we 
going to start?
    The Small Business Regulatory Reduction Act is a great 
first step and I urge support for this legislation, and I yield 
back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    Does anyone else wish to be recognized for a statement on 
Ms. Chu's amendment?
    Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Chair?
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Mr. Stauber?
    Mr. STAUBER. Thank you very much.
    I do believe in my colleague's good intentions on this 
amendment but I am going to oppose it. One of the things that 
we talked about was $375 billion in the last 2-1/2 years. And 
the Chairman is right; I have not had one small business in my 
district that said, please, Washington, put more regulations on 
me. Put more regulations on the business that I run. I have not 
heard one.
    And to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if you 
think we cannot reduce regulations I cannot find any company, 
small business in the district that I represent that can help 
the small business wipe out a regulation that has been harmful 
to them. I believe that there will be no problem if we brought 
in our small businesses across this great nation and said we 
can get rid of this one, this one, and this one. Listen, it is 
$375 billion coming out of COVID. And we talk about small 
businesses being the engine of our economy? If they are truly 
the engine of our economy, they are begging. We have had 
witnesses sit at the table. No more regulations. We have to 
listen to them. And I appreciate Representative Van Duyne for 
bringing this up and Mr. Chair, I appreciate your comments as 
well on that fourth administrative state. Unelected, 
unaccounted bureaucrats putting regulations on small businesses 
that have no idea the ramifications. They think it might be a 
good idea in the back rooms here in Washington, D.C., but when 
you get out to the small businessmen and women in this country 
they are saying enough is enough. Stop the regulations.
    This is a very common-sense piece of legislation, and I 
yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Member yields back.
    Does anyone wish to be recognized for a statement on Ms. 
Chu's amendment?
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman?
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Okay. I recognize the Ranking Member.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I have been asked when are we going to start reducing 
regulations. We will start when we have a thoughtful approach 
that looks at both sides of the ledger--benefits and costs. It 
is just that simple. And, you know, this is clearly a messaging 
bill, but the bottom line is it is unworkable as drafted.
    Let's take, for example, the transitioning of VA to SBA, 
the veteran certification from VA to SBA. There are rules and 
regulations to make it effective. We should not be hindering 
SBA's efforts to provide more oversight to the contracting 
programs or make them stronger. I support the amendment being 
offered by my colleague, Ms. Chu, and I urge my colleagues to 
do the same. I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Ranking Member yields back.
    I now recognize myself to speak against this amendment.
    I oppose this amendment on the same grounds as the previous 
amendment relating to veteran-owned small businesses. You 
cannot regulate economic growth. You can only hamper it. The 
Biden administration's disastrous regulatory agenda has left 
plenty of regulations on the table to be repealed if there is 
one new costly regulation that you truly believe is necessary. 
I oppose this amendment, and once again, I urge all my 
colleagues to do something that will actually help our nation's 
job creators and reduce the number of regulations that they 
must comply with.
    So, the question is now on the Amendment 4 to H.R. 3995 
offered by Ms. Chu.
    All those in favor say aye.
    All those opposed say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the noes have it and the 
amendment is not agreed to.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I would like to request a roll 
call vote.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. A recorded vote has been requested and a 
roll call vote is ordered. Pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and 
House Rule 11, further proceedings on the bill are postponed.
    Does anyone else wish to offer an amendment?
    Okay. Seeing none the question is now on the amendment in 
the nature of a substitute to H.R. 3995 offered by Ms. Van 
Duyne.
    All those in favor say aye.
    All those opposed say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it.
    The amendment and the nature of the substitute to H.R. 3995 
offered by Ms. Van Duyne is agreed to.

    Seeing none, the clerk will report.
    The CLERK. Mr. Chairman, on that vote 14 ayes, 12 nays, and 
0 present.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. H.R. 3995 as amended is adopted and will 
be reported favorably to the House.
    Without objection, Committee staff is authorized to make 
technical and conforming changes and Members have 2 business 
days to file additional supplemental dissenting minority views.
    I want to thank all of you for being here today. I think it 
has been a good hearing, and we often show that we agree on 
more than we do not.
    If there is no further business, this concludes today's 
markup.
    Without objection, the Committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 3:47 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]
