                       TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
          Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met at 10 a.m., in room 538, Dirksen Senate 
Office Building, Hon. Sherrod Brown, Chairman of the Committee, 
presiding.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERROD BROWN

    Chairman Brown. Good morning. The Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs will come to order. Today's hearing 
is in the hybrid format.
    [Unidentified Voice.] This is James Brady with Senator 
Vance. I have Senator Vance here.
    Chairman Brown. Good. These Ohioans are getting a little 
uppity, don't you think? I am glad he is here, one way or the 
other.
    Today's hearing is hybrid. Our witnesses are in person but 
Members have the option to either appear in person or 
virtually.
    Last week marked 1 year since Vladimir Putin unleashed his 
brutal, criminal war on Ukraine. Putin wanted to jeopardize the 
future of sovereign democracy and in the process to threaten 
the world order, an order based on freedom and democracy and 
the rule of law. Putin has been surprised by two things: the 
resilience of the Ukrainian people and President Biden's 
ability to put together and keep together a broad, consistent 
international coalition to support the Ukrainian people as they 
defend their country.
    Last week I again met with Ukrainian Americans in greater 
Cleveland, one of the most vibrant, largest Ukrainian 
communities in our country. My State is proud to have that 
vibrant, active community. Ohioans' message to me was clear: we 
maintain our resolve, and we must continue to hold the Russian 
government accountable along with all of those who enable its 
war on Ukraine. We cannot waver in our commitment to Ukraine. I 
am glad that President Biden and Senator Schumer and Leader 
McConnell all made clear their support last week.
    Many of our colleagues of both parties were overseas last 
week, all showing united, bipartisan support. Our commitment to 
the Ukrainian people, our resolve to stand up to Putin has 
never been partisan. We must recognize that Putin's brutal war 
is the most recent assault that authoritarians are launching 
around the world. All their eyes are on our response in Eastern 
Europe right now.
    The NATO General Secretary said last month if President 
Putin wins in Ukraine this would send a message that 
authoritarian regimes can achieve their goals by brute force. 
Beijing is watching closely and learning lessons that may 
influence its future decisions. It is what the Administration's 
National Security Strategy outlined as, quote, ``a strategic 
competition to shape the future of the international order,'' 
unquote.
    Today's hearing is about how we use economic tools, 
sanctions, export controls, investment screening to advance and 
protect U.S. national security and foreign policy. In addition 
to the humanitarian and military assistance, the United States 
and our allies have provided Ukraine our response to Putin's 
war centered on the significant sanctions and export controls 
we have imposed to ensure that Russia, not the rest of the 
world, bears the full cost of Putin's illegal criminal 
invasion. These measures are imposing real costs on Russia. 
Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo put it pretty well last 
week: ``Our actions are forcing Russia to mortgage its economic 
future to save face today.''
    We, of course, recognize that not all economies are the 
same. Our work is complex as we confront the challenges posed 
by President Xi and the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing. 
Twenty-five years ago Senator Lindsey Graham and I led efforts, 
as House members, to oppose China's accession to the World 
Trade Organization. Corporations in search of ever-growing 
profits shut down manufacturing in Ohio and in South Carolina 
and across the United States and moved production to China. It 
contributed to the industrialization of China, and it has 
funded the buildup direct link. It has funded the buildup of 
the Chinese military.
    I have challenged that failed China policy of 
Administrations of both parties, Presidents in both parties, 
all the way from the first Bush up through Trump. Presidents of 
both parties have failed us on China in that way. It was 
obvious to some of us then, what all of us see now, that China 
poses a real threat to our economic security. Look at 
Columbiana County in Ohio, the home of East Palestine. Look at 
Clarendon County in South Carolina.
    Now the serious national security threats are also obvious. 
The Chinese government made its aims clear, to dominate 
advanced technology and global supply chains. The Chinese 
Communist Party civil-military fusion policy erases the line 
separating commercial and military use of finished goods and 
the technologies that go into them. And we have seen Beijing 
ramp up its activities in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait 
while oppressing its own citizens. Now we are even seeing 
Chinese Communist Party officials meeting with Putin and 
consistently refusing to condemn his invasion of Ukraine. 
Whether in Beijing or Moscow, whether in Iran or North Korea, 
whether it is to address IP theft, human rights abusers, 
foreign traffickers of illicit fentanyl, we need a robust 
economic policy to deter and disrupt behavior that hurts U.S. 
national security interests.
    On this Committee I have worked with colleagues in both 
parties to restrict U.S. technology or financing from being 
used in ways that harm U.S. national security interests. On a 
bipartisan basis, this Committee led reforms to strengthen our 
investment screening process, conducted by CFIUS, the
    Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. We 
have provided permanent statutory authority for the Bureau of 
Industry and Security, the BIS, to administer and enforce our 
export control system. And last Congress, Ranking Member Toomey 
and I led this Committee's work to prohibit the importation of 
Russia gold, to impose sanctions regarding human rights abuses 
by Iran, and to expand BIS's authority to limit exports to 
foreign militaries' intelligence services and security forces. 
We took action last year--many sitting at this table remember--
to remove most-favored-nation trade status from Russia. Actions 
have economic consequences.
    I hope we will continue this strong history of bipartisan 
work on important national and economic security issues in this 
Committee's jurisdiction over the next 2 years with Ranking 
Member Scott, and I am confident we will.
    Today in this hearing we have a chance to take that first 
step by examining how we use our economic toolkit to advance 
the breadth of issues that impact our U.S. national security 
and foreign policy. We must use these tools we have to deter or 
disrupt behavior that undermines our economy. We need to do 
that while we strengthen our partnership with countries that 
share our values for democracy and free markets. We need to do 
that while not harming U.S. economic and technological 
leadership.
    Senator Scott.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TIM SCOTT

    Senator Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I start with 
my comments I just want to acknowledge the challenges and the 
tragedy in East Palestine, Ohio, that you and both Senator 
Vance represent. My prayers are certainly with the folks there 
and hope that we continue to see an all-of-government approach 
to solving the problems and certainly holding those folks 
accountable as well.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you for saying that.
    Senator Scott. Yes, sir.
    Last year marks the 1-year anniversary of Russia's invasion 
of Ukraine. Over this past year we have seen the horrors of war 
and brutal loss of life. But we have also seen the strength of 
the Ukrainian people. Their fight against tyranny and 
oppression to seek and maintain their independence is 
inspiring, and reminds me of our own intrinsic values that 
inform American patriotism, the hope for a better future.
    We are fortunate enough to live in the greatest nation on 
Earth, and must always be vigilant to protect and promote 
national and economic security, the underpinnings of our 
Nation. Preserving or status as a world leader requires the 
continual honing and sharpening of our economic security tools 
in order to preserve and protect the role of America at home 
and abroad.
    These tools are often pushed beyond our everyday 
conversations. Folks do not always bring up sanctions at the 
dinner table, at least not in my house. But they are important 
to protecting and promoting American interests. We have seen 
firsthand, whether it was with Russia or North Korea, that the 
tailored use of sanctions can be an effective foreign policy 
and economic security apparatus.
    Unfortunately, these same tools have been wielded as 
hammers instead of scalpels, resulting in pushing our 
adversaries toward closer cooperation with each other and 
further away from us. Much like the Obama administration's 
famous red line, the Biden administration's failure to enforce 
existing sanctions manifest weakness, which is an unacceptable 
abuse of our Nation's global leadership and signals to friend 
and foe alike that when we are saying something we may not 
actually mean it.
    Recent reports of Chinese and Iranian support for Russian 
weaponry, flouting U.S. sanctions, is just another example. If 
there was ever a time to kowtow to our adversaries, and their 
supporters, I assure you it is not today nor ever. National 
security efforts should support, not detract, from American 
industrial leadership, a commonsense principle. However, 
instead of using American oil and natural gas resources to aid 
our European allies in their efforts to cut ties with Russian 
oil, the Biden administration restrict American energy 
production to promote liberal climate change policies, 
punishing not only our allies but everyday families stuck with 
higher and higher energy bills.
    When looking at tools like export controls and our 
investment security review process, our goals should be a 
holistic one that combats malign economic aggression. 
Specifically, the Chinese Communist Party has enacted laws 
facilitating the theft and unfair treatment of American 
innovation. We must use our export controls to ensure sensitive 
technologies are not being shared with foreign adversaries, 
much like we must use the CFIUS process to ensure bad actors 
are not granted undue access under the guise of benign foreign 
investment.
    Economic security requires precision and strength. We must 
champion American economic opportunity. Hard work and ingenuity 
are two of the main drivers of the American dream, the same 
dream that our adversaries are working to stop.
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on this 
important topic. Thank you.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Scott, and thank you for 
your comments about East Palestine. I was there again 
yesterday----
    Senator Scott. Excellent.
    Chairman Brown. ----and I appreciate the work that Senator 
Vance has done there. And the local congressman, Bill Johnson, 
has been there at least a couple of times a week, and he has 
really stepped up. So thank you.
    Senator Scott. Yes, sir.
    Chairman Brown. I will introduce today's witnesses.
    Daleep Singh is the former Deputy National Security Advisor 
for International Economics at the National Security Council 
and former Deputy Director of the National Economic Council. 
Welcome.
    Clay Lowery served as Assistant Secretary of International 
Affairs at the Department of Treasury. Mr. Lowery, welcome.
    And Kevin Wolf served from 2010 to 2017 as the Assistant 
Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration at BIS at the 
Department of Commerce. Welcome to you, Mr. Wolf.
    We will now begin Mr. Singh's testimony. Thank you.

  STATEMENT OF DALEEP SINGH, FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY 
    ADVISOR FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS, AND FORMER DEPUTY 
   DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL AND NATIONAL ECONOMIC 
                            COUNCIL

    Mr. Singh. Thank you Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, 
distinguished Members, for inviting me to testify, which I am 
doing so today in my personal capacity.
    I will make three points on the Russia sanctions program: 
goals, impact, and lessons learned.
    First on goals. Sanctions serve a geopolitical purpose. 
Before February 24 of last year that purpose was to help 
preserve the peace. How? By signaling to Putin our readiness to 
impose the most severe economic sanctions ever deployed if he 
invaded. Of course, the rest is history. Once the invasion 
began, the objective of sanctions evolved. Short term, maximize 
the costs on Putin for continuing the war; medium term, degrade 
Putin's ability to exert influence and project power on the 
world stage; long term, generate a negative demonstration for 
any autocrat that might consider redrawing borders by force.
    In pursuing these objectives, we unleased the arsenal of 
sanctions we warned Putin about, itself the product of intense 
collaboration with nearly 40 countries. Our shared mindset was 
to attack pressure points, where our collective strengths 
intersect with Russia's vulnerabilities.
    Five channels stood out. Channel one was the delivery of a 
capital account shock. Together with more than half the world's 
economy, we denied capital to and blocked any transactions with 
the largest Russian banks. To Putin's surprise, we then 
immobilized almost half of his central bank's foreign reserves, 
disarming the financial fortress he had built for this war.
    Channel two was the denial of cutting-edge technology to 
Putin. Semiconductors, AI, quantum, robotics, biotech, these 
are the foundational technologies for every modern economy and 
military. Denying these inputs meant we could degrade Putin's 
war machine in Ukraine and anywhere else for generations to 
come.
    Channel three was the removal of Russia's privileges in the 
global economy, its ability to receive a bailout from the IMF 
or the World Bank, its most-favored national trading status, 
thanks to this Committee, its reputation as an investment-grade 
borrower.
    Channel four was the downgrade of Russia's position as a 
leading energy supplier, by shutting down his prized Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline, by banning our imports of Russian energy, by 
undercutting his revenues with a novel oil price cap, and by 
speeding our transition to renewables.
    Channel five was our launch of a global campaign to expose 
and hold to account Russia's kleptocrats. The Russian people 
have been getting ripped off by Putin and his cronies for a 
long time, and they deserved to see it for themselves.
    In terms of impact, I would say sanctions are doing their 
job. First, Russia's economy is contracting, and for years to 
come its growth prospects are bleak. It is true that last 
year's recession is smaller than expected, but do not mistake 
this for resilience. To limit the depth of the current 
recession, Putin sacrificed Russia's economic potential, with 
capital controls, by weaponizing energy, and depleting his 
national savings.
    But let us be clear. The exit of more than 1,000 
multinational companies will bite. So will the flight of up to 
1 million of Russia's best and brightest. So will the loss of 
leading-edge technology. So will the loss of half of his 
customer base for energy. So will default. The Russian 
government itself expects that GDP will bottom 8 to 12 percent 
lower than its 2021 baseline, equivalent to almost $200 billion 
in lost income.
    Second, the crippling effects of our export controls on 
Russia's military-industrial complex are both profound and 
underappreciated. I have given you a sampling of these impacts 
in my written testimony, but the bottom line is that without 
leading-edge technology we have put the Russian military at a 
disadvantage on the battlefield and denied Putin's ambition to 
project power on the world stage.
    Third, Russia's dominant role in global energy markets will 
never be the same. Our strategy to minimize Putin's energy 
revenues while protecting households at the gas pump is 
working. Russia's oil and gas revenues were down almost 50 
percent from last year as of January. Here at home, prices at 
the pump are 15 cents a gallon lower than when the invasion 
began. Overseas, European gas and electricity prices have fully 
retraced.
    As a caveat, let me repeat that sanctions are just one of 
many tools. They work when they are embedded in a broad 
strategy, most importantly, doing all we can to support 
Ukraine's fight for freedom, fortifying NATO's eastern flank, 
doing all we can to help the world deal with the spillovers of 
Putin's war, and working to finance Ukraine's future as a 
successful alternative to Russian kleptocracy. Executing on all 
these fronts and staying the course is what will create 
leverage for Ukraine if and when it chooses a diplomatic 
settlement.
    Reflecting on lessons learned, I am enormously proud of the 
unity we have forged with Europe, the G7, and beyond, within 
hours of the invasion, to move in lockstep with unprecedented 
force, but I have to admit many more countries have stood aside 
and sounded caution about sanctions. So in my judgment we need 
to take four actions to win the global narrative and prepare 
for what is ahead.
    First, we should articulate a doctrine of economic 
statecraft, at the highest levels of government. We have spent 
hundreds of years crafting military doctrine, only a small 
fraction of that time doing so for economic statecraft.
    Second, we should continue building an analytical 
infrastructure that takes economic statecraft seriously.
    Third, we should stress-test the tools economic statecraft 
against conflict scenarios.
    And last, we need balance. Sanctions receive enormous 
attention as a coercive device. If you do not change behavior 
it will cause you pain. But this message rarely wins hearts and 
minds, so it is on us to balance the increased use of sanctions 
which are designed to cause pain with an even greater emphasis 
on statecraft that offers mutual economic gain, our true 
competitive advantage. Infrastructure finance, supply chain 
partnerships, technology alliances, debt relief, revitalizing 
the World Bank can all serve this purpose, and in doing so 
demonstrate the incomparable promise of American economic 
strength as a force for global good.
    Thank you.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Mr. Singh.
    Mr. Lowery, welcome.

   STATEMENT OF CLAY LOWERY, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR 
  INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, AND FORMER DIRECTOR OF INTERNATIONAL 
   FINANCE, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY AND NATIONAL SECURITY 
                            COUNCIL

    Mr. Lowery. Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and 
Members of the Committee, I would like to thank you for the 
opportunity to testify.
    As requested by the Committee, I will discuss briefly the 
economic impact on Russia due to the sanctions regime put in 
place in 2022. I will try not to repeat what Mr. Singh said. 
Two is some of the lessons that can be drawn when you are 
thinking about China. And three, and a little bit different, 
the idea of an outward-bound investment screening mechanism 
using the prism of CFIUS to judge it.
    The United States, along with a number of allies, imposed, 
arguably, the most robust financial sanctions package in 
history. A year later, this has had a substantial economic and 
financial impact. But it has neither been as dramatic nor as 
sweeping as was estimated last year. Although the sanctions 
regime was expansive, there were still major carveouts, for 
natural gas, oil, petroleum products. The exports of these 
products enabled Russia's current account surplus to nearly 
double in 2022, which means an extra $100 billion, which helped 
Russia provide much-needed liquidity to their economy and 
revenue to prop up their fiscal position.
    Second, while the Biden administration quickly and 
successfully put together a significant multilateral coalition 
for sanctions, this coordination, in some respects, has not 
been broad enough, and let me just provide an example.
    Russian oil export volumes fell across the EU, Japan, 
Korea, and several other countries, yet Russian oil export 
volumes overall were still up in 2022, as countries such as 
China, India, and Turkey increased their purchases.
    And finally, Russia also adapted to the sanctions. The 
Central Bank of Russia, for instance, took swift and decisive 
measures that allowed the exchange rate and the banking system 
to stabilize.
    Now, Russia's economic and financial resilience, in the 
face of such a major sanctions program, does not mean that the 
program was a failure. In fact, it seems to be having an 
impact, as Mr. Singh said, on Russia's ability to obtain 
warfighting materials, has led to a brain drain, and is likely 
to lead to a slow but steady decrease in both productivity and 
economic activity for years to come.
    So you have asked me to consider how such a sanctions 
program would look like in the case of China. The key 
difference, of course, between China and Russia is China's 
economy and overall engagement in the world economy is simply 
magnitudes bigger than Russia, in both scope and in scale, and 
to an extent, we would really be comparing an apple to an 
orange. However, there may be three insights from Russia as 
they relate to China that are worth thinking about.
    First is China, like Russia, has a significant current 
account surplus. But instead of being a major commodity 
exporter, they are the top exporter of manufactured goods. In 
fact, China's share of global manufactured exports are more 
than twice the share of Russia's share of energy and fuel 
exports.
    Second, international coordination may be more difficult as 
it relates to China. China's much broader and deeper engagement 
in international economics system suggests that choosing to 
implement sanctions, frankly, will be a much more difficult 
decision for jurisdictions around the world.
    And third, there is implementation risk. Even if 
international coordination is high, sanctions regimes are quite 
complex, and executing on them and implementing them is not 
like flipping a switch, and China will be even more complex 
than Russia.
    So the bottom line is that sanctions regimes are difficult 
to implement, multilateral cooperation is quite complicated, 
particularly for larger economies, you cannot plug every leak, 
and countries adapt.
    Now, let me switch to thinking about outward-bound 
investment and its relationship to CFIUS.
    One of the tools that the Administration and Congress has 
been considering to influence our economic relationship with 
China is an outward-bound investment screening mechanism, and 
some have referred to it as a reverse CFIUS. As an individual 
who oversaw CFIUS, let me try to think about what the key 
lessons from CFIUS are that could be applied.
    The first is understanding the objective of CFIUS. It is to 
ensure national security while promoting foreign investment. It 
is not a balance. It is both. To me, this means you have to 
minimize the opportunity for politicizing transactions, you 
have to keep CFIUS narrowly focused on national security, and 
you need to ensure accountability of the executive branch.
    The lessons that I think can further be drawn for trying to 
come up with legislation or executive branch action on an 
outward-bound investment are avoid the temptation to use vague 
and ill-defined terms; do not duplicate existing authorities; 
understand that there is a resource burden on the executive 
branch that makes implementation difficult; and realize that 
placing such government controls on private sector 
transactions, particularly in cases that have nothing to do 
with national security, is likely to harm our competitiveness 
and may prove to be counterproductive to our national security.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today, and I 
would be pleased to take any questions.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Mr. Lowery.
    Mr. Wolf, you are recognized. Thank you for being here.

 STATEMENT OF KEVIN WOLF, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF EXPORT 
             ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

    Mr. Wolf. Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and other 
Members of the Committee, thank you for asking me back. The 
views I express today are my own.
    As requested, I am providing a description of export 
control policy in historical context with recommendations for 
how to make export controls, particular with respect to China 
and Russia, more effective and less counterproductive.
    To level set, unlike sanctions, export controls are the 
rule that govern the export, reexport, and transfer of 
commodities, software, technology, and occasionally services to 
specific destinations, end uses, and end users to accomplish 
various national security or foreign policy objectives.
    My prepared remarks set out a lot more detail, but really 
the current discussion that is taking place is what is the 
contemporary national security objective to be achieved with 
respect to a system that was originally created to be focused 
on identifying items for use in producing or developing weapons 
of mass destruction or conventional weapons. And the post-cold 
war era system, a system created in the 1990s, that largely 
governs the laws of our allies, and is the foundation for the 
U.S. system, although the U.S. system is broader, means that 
the allied export control systems do not have generally the 
legal authorities or the cultures to address contemporary 
national security issues such as strategic competition 
concerns, military-civil fusion policies, human rights abuses, 
in particular involving commercial technologies, supply chain 
security, and the need to promote democracy over 
authoritarianism.
    And the rise of the military-civil fusion policies that you 
referred to is particularly significant because this classical 
dual-use system was created on the premise that one could tell 
the distinction between an item for civil and military 
applications.
    And so to address these issues I put together and described 
a series of recommendations, and the first is to, for the 
Committee and the Congress to support the Administration 
efforts to work with allies to develop and articulate together 
a significantly expanded vision for export controls to address 
these contemporary common strategic national security and human 
rights objectives that are outside the scopes of the post-cold 
war era multilateral export regimes.
    And second, to ensure that this vision can be implemented 
and updated in domestic regulations of our allies, to work with 
the Administration to create a new, multilateral export control 
regime, again, with two mandates: to address classical export 
control issues that cannot be addressed by the current regimes 
given Russia's ability to veto any program in the regimes, and 
then the second mandate would be to address these items that 
are of contemporary strategic security issues, particularly 
with respect to China and Russia.
    Third, to work with the allies to create and announce 
standards for the legal authorities that each of the allied 
governments should have in their export control systems in 
order to implement either a new regime or short-term 
plurilateral arrangements to address nonclassical export 
control issues.
    And then also the Congress should work with or require and 
support the Administration efforts to work with the allies in 
order to develop, with their legislatures and executive 
branches, the legal authorities and the funding for their 
export control agencies to be able to have these authorities 
and to work with the United States.
    Fifth, to echo in a regular and a bipartisan way that this 
new vision for export control thinking about strategic controls 
is in the common security interests of each of the allies, and 
to overcome what is quite significant skepticism among the 
allies, make it clear on a regular basis that this is not a 
mercantilistic effort by the United States to promote economic 
advantage of U.S. companies over companies in allied countries. 
And as an incentive for participation, to create incentives and 
benefits for allies to cooperate with this new vision for 
export controls, particularly in the form of the reduction of 
unnecessary trade barriers caused by export controls as a 
result of history by and among and between the close allies.
    With respect to the enforcement side, to significantly 
enhance the Administration's efforts and the allied country 
efforts to data mine, to conduct investigations, to work 
together, and to coordinate on global enforcement efforts.
    Seventh, as part of the AUKUS initiative, Congress should 
support Administration efforts to radically harmonize and 
simplify the defense trade and dual-use rules by, among, and 
between close allies--Australia, the U.K., Canada, the United 
States of course.
    All of these recommendations and others that I listed are 
going to be really quite hard. I admit that. But success will 
require inspired, inspirational, long-term, fact-based, and 
bipartisan leadership. So all other alternatives are worse.
    So with that I will stop and answer any questions you might 
have.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Mr. Wolf.
    I will start with Mr. Singh. The world watched with horror 
as Putin initiated an illegitimate war, a criminal war against 
the people of Ukraine. I know that Ukrainian Americans in my 
home State support the United States and the global coalition 
imposing sweeping sanctions and export controls in response to 
the invasion.
    Describe the effect of this, if you would, Mr. Singh, of 
our response, and what metrics we should look at when 
determining whether sanctions and other economic measures are 
having an impact.
    Mr. Singh. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for those 
sentiments as well. So let us start with the facts. Russia is 
in a recession. It was growing at 4.7 percent in 2021, the year 
before the invasion. Last year it contracted 2.2 percent. That 
is a fairly sizable swing.
    Now it is true, the depth of the recession is not as large 
as many expected, including me, but I would not mistake this 
for resilience. It is not strength. It is more like a Potemkin 
facade. What Putin has done is prop up the current growth of 
the economy in exchange for sacrificing long-run growth 
potential, and there are three ways in which he did that. 
First, he slapped on capital controls. If you a have capital 
controls that means if you have rubles you cannot sell them for 
dollars. That arrested the freefall of the ruble, but it meant 
that it was much more difficult for Russia to actually import. 
Imports are priced in dollars, and that has led to a depletion 
of the goods Russia needs to modernize its economy, to 
diversify its economy.
    Second, he weaponized energy, and that, of course, spiked 
energy prices worldwide, it flattered his trade surplus, it 
lifted GDP growth, but at the cost of losing half of his 
customer base, the G7, and it led to a price cap which will 
crimp his revenues even outside the G7. The latest budget 
figures in Russia showed a 46 percent decline in oil and gas 
revenues in January, relative to last year.
    The third thing he did is he spiked Government spending by 
60 percent as of the last month. Of course, much of that money 
went into the war machine, and that lifted GDP growth, but at 
the cost of hundreds of thousands of Russian lives that have 
been lost, to say nothing, of course, of the lives that have 
been lost in Ukraine. It also depleted his national savings. It 
pushed up inflation and interest rates.
    So look, the Russian government's own analysis shows that 
its economy will bottom 8 to 12 percent lower than in 2021, and 
I actually think that is an aggressive estimate. He has lost 
1,000 multinational companies. He has lost a million of his 
best and brightest. He has lost his technology base. He has 
lost his access to capital markets, and he is in default. That 
is the end game for Putin.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you.
    Mr. Wolf, that was the all-positive response about what 
export controls and sanctions have done. Take the other side a 
little bit. Describe the limitations of current export control 
regimes and how the global response to the invasion of Ukraine 
is presented in both assessing an opportunity for a new 
multilateral export control regime.
    Mr. Wolf. Terrific. Thank you. As I mentioned, the current 
export control system of our allies was established in the 
1990s to focus on items of direct relevance to producing or 
developing or using weapons of mass destruction or conventional 
weapons, and so it does not address any of the contemporary 
national security issues that have been mentioned earlier, 
including the strategic security issues, human rights 
objectives, and country-specific issues, or the civil-military 
fusion policies that you mentioned in your introduction. Also, 
the way the regimes work is that each member has a veto over 
any change or progress, and Russia is a member of three of the 
four regimes and is apparently vetoing significant process.
    And so as a structural matter, to enhance the effectiveness 
of the controls and to reduce counterproductive impacts on U.S. 
industry to level the playing field I have been advocating for 
the creation of a new regime to address both of those mandates, 
and for the United States to lead that effort to create it. I 
have got much longer versions of the description in my 
testimony, but that is the essential answer.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you.
    Back to you again, Mr. Singh. Given the economies of Russia 
and China are very different, you talked about commodities 
versus manufacturing as sort of the trademark, if that is the 
right word, of each, and have different levels of 
interconnectedness with the United States and our allies, what 
lessons may be learned from the Russia response that would be 
helpful in understanding the challenges in using our economic 
toolkit with China?
    Mr. Singh. So first on the differences, you are right, and 
Mr. Lowery alluded to this. China's economy is 10 times larger 
than that of Russia. Its banking sector is 30 times larger than 
that of Russia. It is the largest manufactured goods exporter 
in the world by a very large margin. It has a dominant position 
in many different critical supply chains--solar panels, EV 
batteries, machine tools, 5G, even parts of the semiconductor 
supply chain like assembly and packaging.
    It also has nearly a peer status with us on foundational 
technologies like AI, biotech, and even quantum. And then last, 
it has accumulated a lot of soft power since the Belt and Road 
Initiative was initiated in 2013. It is the largest lender to 
developing countries, two times as much as all other Western 
governments combined, and much more than the World Bank.
    Now, how do we confront the circumstances? Well, I think, 
you know, drawing from the lesson of Russia, we have to start 
with objectives and strategy. What is the objective? Is it 
deterrence? Is it to degrade the target's ability to project 
power and exert influence? Is it to maximize costs? Is it a 
demonstration effect? Is it to fire a warning shot? Depending 
on the objective and the strategy we can then have, I think, an 
analysis-driven understanding of how our strengths intersect 
with the target's vulnerabilities.
    And it is from that point that you choose tools. Some of 
these will be negative coercive devices like sanctions, export 
controls, tariffs, any delistings. Others can be positive 
inducements, to win the narrative with countries that would 
have to join a coalition, and that is what I was making 
reference to in terms of infrastructure finance and debt relief 
and bilateral assistance, and using the institutions we have 
built, like the World Bank and the IMF, to build a coalition 
that can make a difference.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you. Ranking Member Scott.
    Senator Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    During implementation of our sanctions on Russia many 
experts predicted a collapse of the Russian economy, turning 
the clock back to the 1980s Soviet Russia. However, it now 
appears that Russia has been able to work to mask the full 
impact of sanctions by spending against their future spending 
now.
    Putin has decided that his life is more valuable than the 
lives of Russia's children and its future. It is business as 
usual there and the IMF is even predicting the Russian economy 
will grow next year. If this prediction holds true, that is 
troubling to me. It is like driving with your ``check engine'' 
light on. The car keeps going but you know sooner or later it 
is going to be on the side of the road.
    To no one's surprise, Russian oil revenues are the one 
thing keeping their war machine going. Mr. Lowery, could you 
describe how the Russian economy is currently functioning and 
what impact you would expect if the United States sought more 
expansive sanctions on Russian energy?
    Mr. Lowery. Thank you, Senator Scott. So I agree with both 
you and Mr. Singh that this is not necessarily purely about 
Russian resilience. It is also about Russia basically, you 
know, selling its future for the here and now. But, of course, 
the here and now is what we are dealing with now, and you are 
correct. The IMF basically is predicting a flat, maybe slight 
growth in Russia's economy next year. There are others out 
there that predict a slight decline. But whatever it is, it is 
not that dramatic.
    Now Mr. Singh made a really valuable point, which was that 
we have seen a falloff in oil revenue over the last few months. 
So while the summer and the early fall for Russia was actually 
dramatically positive, from a revenue perspective, it has 
fallen off. This could start having more of an impact on the 
overall economy than even in the IMF has predicted.
    Now, could there be more that is done? I think the answer 
is yes, but it is all in. Again, it is difficult, right? So the 
areas that it seems like we could do a bit more, and we are 
starting to see it, Europe has now put in place essentially an 
embargo on Russian oil and Russian petroleum products, not 
natural gas. The G7 has tried to put in a price cap on those 
very same products. We are trying to figure out how well that 
will work. The jury is still out on that.
    The key area is can we get more countries to join in, and 
that, as we have seen, has been very complicated, and also 
could we do more on natural gas area, which again is a nice 
revenue provider for Russia.
    So those are some areas in the petroleum area. There are 
other areas that we could probably discuss, but that hopefully 
answers your question.
    Senator Scott. It does, Mr. Lowery. Another question on the 
same topic of energy perspective. Would you imagine that if 
America started increasing its exports of energy because we 
increased our energy production, that would also give us 
another tool in the toolkit as it relates to--I mean, you just 
described, really, a blanket going over much of Russia's 
production, and yet we still see our allies struggling in 
Europe. If we had more production would we have a stronger 
toolkit?
    Mr. Lowery. Yes. I mean, I do not think there can be any 
doubt about that.
    Senator Scott. I like asking questions I think I know the 
answer to on this point.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Scott. If your response was different I would be 
really surprised.
    Mr. Lowery. Yeah, no. Look, the United States is an energy 
provider and an exporter, and one of the most fascinating parts 
we have seen--I had mentioned Russia's adjustments. It is also 
the adaptability of some of our allies. Germany was not able to 
take in natural gas from a number of countries except for 
Russia. They have put in a massive investment to try to change 
that, so that they can diversify where they get their natural 
gas, whether it is from Qatar, Norway, or the United States. 
And so I think that boosting our ability to export in those 
areas seems like something that could be helpful to our allies 
as well as, obviously, to our own economy.
    Senator Scott. Well, I only have 25 seconds left so I will 
save my question for the next round, to Mr. Singh. But I will 
say that when I was on the Energy Committee back in 2014-2015, 
one of the things I saw was, from Lithuania, their minister 
came over and said, ``Please, please, please, start exporting 
LNG.'' And we were just silent on that decision, and previous 
decisions continue to have a domino effect on our ability to be 
in a stronger position from a global perspective when you need 
it the most.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Scott.
    Senator Menendez is recognized, from New Jersey.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for 
holding this hearing on the question of sanctions.
    So I see that China continues to buy millions of barrels of 
oil from Russia, but we do not seem to sanction them. I see 
that Turkey is involved. According to Bloomberg, between March 
and October of last year, Turkish exporters sent about $800 
million worth of goods to Russia, including $300 million in 
machinery and $80 million in electronics.
    So what more can we do, or should we be doing, to send 
countries a message that if you violate the sanctions there are 
consequences? Because the sanctions are only as good as their 
enforcement, at the end of the day. I have been the architect 
of many of them. But without enforcement they are meaningless.
    So Mr. Singh or Mr. Lowery, can you talk to the China 
question? Why is it that we do not seem to sanction China when 
they are getting millions of barrels? I mean, this is not like, 
you know, a super state secret. The world knows that they are 
doing this yet we do not seem to sanction them. Is there some 
impediment?
    Mr. Lowery. So will try to start. So it is correct that 
China, India, Turkey have been a diversification strategy for 
Russian oil exports, and other exports and imports. The issue 
will be is that China and India, particularly, never signed 
onto the sanctions regime in the first place. And so this is 
kind of the point about like Mr. Singh and his team and the 
people at the Biden administration worked very hard on building 
out a coalition, and it was really difficult. But it was not 
perfect, and so you did not get some economies to join in.
    So the question then is how do you then do it, and it is 
hard to actually come up with mechanisms that do not create 
other consequences that are problematic. And so that kind of 
leads you toward greater diplomacy and working with countries 
that are slightly more adversarial toward us, and somewhat 
better, actually, slightly more friendly to us, but they are 
countries that we have----
    Senator Menendez. We have used secondary sanctions before. 
Mr. Singh? We have used secondary sanctions before. We do not 
necessarily have to say if you do not sign on you get a free 
pass, because then, you know, a lot of the world would not sign 
on, right, or they can get the free pass without consequence.
    Mr. Singh. So Senator, I mean, I will pick up on Mr. 
Lowery's comments. Unlike cutting-edge technology or foreign 
capital, in energy we do not have an asymmetric advantage 
because of Russia's status as the world's second-largest 
producer of oil and third-largest producer of natural gas. And 
so we had to take a different approach which was to say how can 
we minimize his energy export revenues while maintaining a 
steady supply of global energy so we do not hit Americans at 
the pump?
    So our first effort in this regard was, well, let us shut 
down----
    Senator Menendez. China does not hit us at the pump.
    Mr. Singh. So if Russia exports none of its oil to global 
markets and we do not have a replacement, the concern would be 
without OPEC+ or domestic producers filling the gap we would 
see a spike in prices that would cause even more of an 
inflation problem than we were experiencing last year.
    And so what we have done with China, India, and Turkey is 
said receive the gift of our bargaining power. Ride the 
coattails of this cap, and insist to Russia that you pay no 
more than the $60 a barrel that we have set. And, of course, we 
can reduce that cap to $50, $40, $30, down to the marginal cost 
of production for Russia, and that is the way in which we can 
gradually tighten the vice grip on Putin's energy export 
revenues without hurting Americans, in terms of the cost of 
energy, the cost of food.
    Senator Menendez. Well, according to the Administration's 
own words, where they say that China is considering the 
possibility of sending arms to Russia, that has not worked out 
too well. You know, it has not worked out too well. They are 
considering selling arms to Russia, which dramatically changes 
the nature of this conflict if they were to do so. So in my 
mind either you are in a fight to win or you are in a fight to 
delay a long period of time.
    One last question. As Chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee I have an increasing view that the United States has 
to lead the creation of an economic alliance among like-minded 
countries that can provide a framework for cooperative action 
in response to military aggression, violations to sovereignty, 
economic coercion, and retaliation by adversaries. Mr. Singh, 
as the coordinator of the international economic response to 
Putin's invasion of Ukraine do you believe that something like 
this, an economic NATO, so to speak, is something that could be 
done?
    Mr. Singh. I think it is a fantastic idea to look at where 
our collective strengths intersect with the target's 
vulnerabilities and to move together, because otherwise we will 
be perceived as deploying the unilateral exercise of American 
financial force. That is not what we are talking about here. We 
are talking about the shared defense of core principles that 
underpin peace and security. So I think your idea is very much 
on point.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you. I understand the Chairman 
asked me to recognize Senator Rounds.
    Senator Scott. Senator Rounds.
    Senator Rounds. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, first 
of all thank you for coming before the Committee today. We do 
appreciate it.
    As you know, there have been numerous reports of suspicious 
activity by U.S. adversaries in regard to U.S. agricultural 
land purchases. In 2020, a Chinese-linked company planned to 
build a wind energy farm project near Del Rio, Texas, only 
miles away from Laughlin Air Force Base, where U.S. pilots are 
trained, and in 2022, a CCP-linked company attempted to build a 
corn milling plant on farmland near a sensitive Air Force base 
outside of Grand Forks, North Dakota.
    My question to Mr. Singh, to begin with, in your experience 
as a former Deputy National Security Advisor for International 
Economics, how might foreign investment in U.S. ag land and 
companies by adversarial nations, particularly China, Russia, 
North Korea, and Iran, how could that impact our national 
security, especially if in close proximity to military 
installations?
    Mr. Singh. Thank you, Senator. Food security is economic 
security. Food security is national security. I think it is as 
simple as that. The supply chain for food in this country has 
to be treated with the utmost importance in the same way that 
we do with foundational technologies and the same way that we 
do with energy and manufactured goods.
    You have added an additional layer of concern, which is 
that if the land that is built, or in a Green-Field Investment 
is used for the purpose of spying, that raises an additional 
level of concern. And so CFIUS has the capacity to require 
notification for the acquisition of land above a certain 
threshold, it can bring in the experts to determine whether a 
national security risk is implicated, and that strikes me as a 
reasonable way forward.
    Senator Rounds. Thank you. Mr. Lowery, we have bipartisan 
legislation. In fact, Senator Tester and I have it together. It 
is called the PASS Act, and that would prohibit China, Russia, 
Iran, and North Korea from purchasing U.S. ag land and 
agricultural companies as well as adding the Secretary of Ag as 
a standing member of the
    Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, 
CFIUS. The agricultural industry is, in my opinion, a 
significant part of not just my home State's economy but 
nationally, and making it a true potential target for foreign 
investment, particularly when you add in the geographic 
specifics that we have identified in the last two specific 
issues.
    How might legislation like the PASS Act help protect this 
very important sector, particularly in these geographic 
locations?
    Mr. Lowery. Thank you, Senator. I do not know the specifics 
of your legislation but from what you just described I think 
that the issue to think about is a couple-fold. One is, as Mr. 
Singh kind of alluded to, CFIUS does have the ability, under 
FIRRMA, the law that was passed to reform CFIUS back in 2018, 
and the regulation in 2020, to look at Green-Field Investments 
in agricultural spots that provide a national security nexus.
    So in terms of a few things, one is if the Department of 
Agriculture should be part of CFIUS that is something, I think, 
that is a very reasonable idea. Right now if there is an 
agricultural aspect to a transaction, Agriculture can be 
brought in by CFIUS, and it has been in the past. But that does 
not mean it should not be more of a regular operation as 
opposed to kind of an ad hoc type of thing.
    In terms of a prohibition on specific countries and 
investments, I would have to really look at it. I have my 
concerns about that because I do believe strongly in the 
ability for countries and entities to invest in the United 
States, because I think that is actually a positive for the 
United States. So I am a little reluctant on suggesting 
outward, absolutely prohibitions. But I think that without 
seeing the legislation I think that would be my caution, I 
guess.
    Senator Rounds. Thank you. The reason why I asked is 
because the prohibition was specific to those associated with 
China and North Korea, Russia in particular right now, and I 
think that is a huge part of it, and Iran. And particularly 
because I cannot imagine why anyone would want them to be able 
to purchase farmland, in particular, particularly if it was an 
area that was near a sensitive geographic location. It 
surprised us that those particular two areas that I identified 
earlier had actually gone as far as they did before they were 
stopped.
    So I appreciate that, and thank you for your comments. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Rounds.
    Senator Tester, from Montana, is recognized.
    Senator Tester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, 
and congratulations to the Ranking Member for taking over this 
Committee. It is the first time I have been here in person, I 
have been online, so thank you for your leadership.
    Senator Scott. Thank you, Mr. Tester. I will extend to you 
another 30 seconds, please.
    Senator Tester. Perfect. Yeah, keep going. That is perfect.
    So Senator Rounds brought up an issue that is near and dear 
to my heart because we have a bill on it, so it ain't over with 
yet, folks. I want to talk to you more about China, North 
Korea, Russia, Iran being prohibited from buying land. No. 1, 
let us just take it at that face value. Do we have the ability 
to be able to track and stop that sale from happening on 
farmland, or an agribusiness, because it applies to both?
    Mr. Lowery. Right now my understanding of the rules for 
CFIUS is that if a transaction was in a Green-Field transaction 
and is within a certain mileage, basically, of sensitive 
areas----
    Senator Tester. OK.
    Mr. Lowery. ----then CFIUS can investigate that 
transactions and make a determination on whether or not it is a 
national security issue, and eventually, potentially even block 
it.
    Senator Tester. OK. And so the definition of ``sensitive 
area'' becomes pretty damn important.
    Mr. Lowery. I would suggest yes.
    Senator Tester. And do you have any idea what the mileage 
is on that?
    Mr. Lowery. So I think that CFIUS has put together 
regulations, and they have created an annex, and that annex 
actually says which are the sensitive sites.
    Senator Tester. I got you. Like an ICBM missile silo would 
be a sensitive site.
    Mr. Lowery. That seems like it would be.
    Senator Tester. And the question is, does that extend 500 
miles? Fifty miles? Five miles?
    Mr. Lowery. I cannot remember off the top of my head, and I 
apologize.
    Senator Tester. That is important to know. And this, by the 
way, would not only ban that, it would ban it all. Because 
quite frankly, and I am going to tell you and I do not want to 
speak for Senator Rounds, I do not think China, North Korea, 
Russia, or Iran gives a damn whether we exist or not, so why 
should we allow them entrance, any entrance, into our country? 
Because if you take a look at those countries they are all 
affiliated--if a Chinese company comes in, they are affiliated 
with the Chinese Communist Party.
    So the question becomes--we can have the debate; it does 
not matter. Rounds and I already have our minds made up. This 
is a good thing to have happen, for not only America's national 
security but for our food security, which is you had already 
pointed out, are one in the same. The question becomes if we 
put it into effect, can you give us the ability so we can 
actually enforce it, so we could actually enforce it, number 
one. Number two, is it even possible to do this, assuming they 
are not going to come in as an oligarch from Russia but use a 
shell company that may be a Canadian company?
    Mr. Lowery. So right now, under CFIUS, CFIUS has become 
expansive in the last few years, and instead of dealing with 
100 or so transactions a year it is now dealing with over 400. 
OK? So that means you have to have resources. You have to be 
able to look. These are national security issues that people 
are looking at.
    If you expand to the whole of the United States and 
basically say every single purchase of any type of land by 
anybody from China, whether they are from a private sector or 
government sector, or from Russia----
    Senator Tester. By the way, unless you can----
    Mr. Lowery. ----amount of work----
    Senator Tester. If you can prove to me different, private 
sector is government sector in China.
    Mr. Lowery. That is fine. But the thing is that what we 
have to think about is in some respects how big is the issue or 
the problem at this point. Is there a lot of ownership, and I 
think the answer is probably no. But then if you are going to 
look at every single transaction that takes place on farmland 
from foreign buyers--because if you are concerned about shell 
companies that could be a fairly significant expansion of 
CFIUS.
    Senator Tester. Yeah. I think it would be, and I think the 
challenge is do we think this is real or do we not think this 
is real? And one of our challenges, and this is the scary part, 
we do not know how big of an issue it is. We do not know how 
big of an issue it is. I can tell you, I had a farm bill 
listening session. Montana is a pretty good-sized State. It is 
540 miles long and 400 miles wide. I have not had one yet where 
this issue has not either been brought up in public or in 
private. So there is land transferring all over the place here, 
and I think we need to get our hands on it.
    You know, the balloon should have been a wake-up call for 
us all. It really should have been. Because the truth is if 
they own land where I live, which is, as the crow flies, 
probably 60 miles from the nearest silo, I would say that that 
is of concern for me. So what the hell. I mean, there are 
sensitive sites all over the country.
    Here is what I hope, guys, and then I am going to turn it 
back to the Chairman. I hope you will work with us to make this 
workable, and I know it is going to be complicated, and I know 
that people are going to say this cannot be done. But I think 
this is a huge issue. I think it is a huge national security 
issue, and I do not think we should be allowing countries who 
do not give a damn whether we exist or not, owning land, 
whether it is farmland or agribusiness in this country. They 
are not our friends. They are not here to do us good things. 
OK?
    Thank you all very much.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Tester, and thank you, 
too, for your outspokenness for years, maybe for decades, about 
Chinese coming and buying up American farmland. I know that is 
especially important because it is how you make your living, 
your other living, so thank you.
    Senator Kennedy is recognized, from Louisiana.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to talk 
just for a second about sanctions with respect to Russia, which 
I support. I think most of us do.
    Only a third of the world's population lives in countries 
that have both condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and have 
agreed to join in to the sanctions imposed by the United States 
and the West. Mr. Singh, does not the Biden administration need 
to do a better job of getting our world's neighbors on board?
    Mr. Singh. Senator, thank you. Asian American self-
critique, I wish we had a broader coalition, but I would not 
want to make the mistake of conflating population with power. 
These sanctions work where we have an asymmetric advantage. The 
world's major reserve currency issuers, with the exception of 
China, are all part of this sanctions regime. So we 
collectively deny foreign capital to Russia. That is what 
matters. We collectively have the world's major designers and 
producers of cutting-edge technology within the sanctions 
regime. It may not represent the majority of the world's 
population but it is the group that matters. So we are 
delivering----
    Senator Kennedy. Let me stop you for a moment, and I 
apologize.
    Mr. Singh. No problem.
    Senator Kennedy. The time goes by so quickly. Why cannot 
the Biden administration convince India to help us?
    Mr. Singh. We are trying. I tried. I went there and we have 
had a steady stream of officials go to India and try to work 
with the deal space that we have. I think we have got quite a 
bit of leverage because of the relationship that we are 
building, across trade, energy, infrastructure, finance, 
defense. I think we have got to play the long game with 
counties that have historically tried to carve out a non-
aligned stance and want to hedge their bets somewhat.
    Senator Kennedy. Well, I understand the long game and I 
know sanctions take time, but in the long term here Putin could 
win.
    As you know, Europe and the United States have designed a 
set of sanctions and export controls to basically try to cap 
the price of Russia's oil at $60.
    Mr. Singh. Yes.
    Senator Kennedy. Now we both know that is not terribly 
punitive because China and India are paying a whole lot less 
than $60 a barrel to China.
    Mr. Singh. In part because of the cap, Senator.
    Senator Kennedy. I mean, if we really want to cutoff 
Putin's cash-flow why do we not set that cap at the marginal 
cost of production for Russia, to follow up on what Senator 
Menendez said. Now you have done something. Why do you not do 
that?
    Mr. Singh. I think we can get there.
    Senator Kennedy. Well, what are we waiting on?
    Mr. Singh. Well, first you have got to build a coalition. 
You have got to get enough countries to have a coalition that 
has bargaining power, that can actually influence the global 
price of oil, because that is what we pay. And now we got a 37-
or-so country coalition that is influencing the price that 
Russia can sell its oil to, not only to us but we are not 
importing any.
    Senator Kennedy. I get it. I understand it, and I 
understand the polities of it. You have got to worry about the 
price of gasoline too, in America. I get all that. But what are 
we waiting on? I mean, the longer we wait--I think it is 
becoming clearer and clearer that Putin has misjudged the 
people of Ukraine.
    Mr. Singh. Yes.
    Senator Kennedy. And it is becoming clearer and clearer 
that President Xi has misjudged President Putin. He believed 
him, that he could roll into Kyiv like thunder on a summer 
night. Now, you say on one hand that is good. On the other 
hand, that makes both Xi and Putin desperate, which I think is 
why Xi is talking about sending arms to Putin. I understand the 
politics of it, but why do we not just go to our friends in 
Europe and say, ``Look, we are going to either win this thing 
or not.''
    Now this $60 cap on oil, we both know that is not having a 
serious effect. It is having some effect. I do not mean to 
criticize your work. But if you really want to strangle them, 
reduce that cap down to the marginal cost of production for 
Russia and you cutoff their cash-flow.
    Mr. Singh. Senator, I think two things can be true. We are 
having an effect. His oil and gas revenues are down almost 50 
percent, year over year. But you are right that we can do more. 
For example----
    Senator Kennedy. Why are we not doing it?
    Mr. Singh. Well, I am no longer in the administration. 
Maybe we are working on it.
    Senator Kennedy. Yeah, but you have got friends there.
    Mr. Singh. Sure. Maybe we are.
    Senator Kennedy. I mean, I do not mean to just pick on you. 
But you are a very smart guy and I have learned a lot listening 
to you. Gentlemen, do you all have any thoughts on that?
    Mr. Wolf. I will defer to Daleep.
    Mr. Lowery. I think you make very fair points. Daleep's 
point is a very good one, which is it is just hard sometimes to 
build a coalition. If you saw the argumentation within the EU 
over the $60 price cap was, as far as I can tell, as an 
outsider's view, a knock-down-drag-out fight within the EU. 
Because I think there were countries, like Poland, who wanted a 
much lower cap, but then there were other countries who wanted 
a higher cap.
    Senator Kennedy. And excuse me for interrupting but I am 
about out of time. Let us just face reality, OK? Europe, if we 
have learned nothing from we have learned that Europe is 
totally dependent on the United States of America for its 
security, period, and were it not for the United States of 
America Putin would be in Paris right now. I think we need to 
get a little tougher and firmer on our friends in Europe.
    I am sorry, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your indulgence.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Warner is recognized from his office, from 
Virginia.
    Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate 
you holding this hearing. I think it is critically important. 
Many of my colleagues' questions I agree with.
    I want to take it in a slightly different direction, from 
my role as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee. I want to 
talk about how we can limit foreign technology in the United 
States, because I do think the technology competition, 
particularly with China, over the balance of this century is 
going to be where our futures are going to be decided. And my 
feeling right now is we have taken kind of a Whac-A-Mole 
approach to this issue. A number of years back, on the Intel 
Committee, we identified the problem with Russian software 
company Kaspersky. We dealt with that. We identified the 
challenges with Huawei and we have spent monies to kind of whip 
and replace. We have seen activity using the Secretary of 
Commerce's tools to go after some of the----
    [Audio interruption.]
    Senator Warner. ----companies in China on the entities 
list, and now many of us are concerned about the notion of 
communication firms like TikTok and the potential of taking 
American data or being used as a massively used propaganda tool 
for the Communist Party of China.
    So, Mr. Wolf, I know this is an area of your expertise. 
Where do we have limitations? As we think about restraints on 
foreign technologies would it not be better to have a broad, 
holistic approach that could take on any of these technology 
changes? Could you address this?
    Mr. Wolf. Sure. Thank you. I am happy to help. What you are 
referring to are the Information, Communication, and Technology 
Supply Chain Regulations that were published in final form at 
the end of the Trump administration, and the current Commerce 
Department has continued and has given responsibility to my 
former Bureau, the Bureau of Industry and Security. And I think 
your bill or others, in order to give congressional voice and 
authority and mandate and resources to implementing that is 
really quite critical. Right now the authority is under the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act and it would be, in 
my view, best that Congress speak directly and clearly as to 
it.
    The authority addresses a gap between export controls, 
which is outbound focused, CFIUS, which is inbound, when there 
is an investment, and what you are referring to is to the 
extent that there are transactions or activities involving the 
communications supply stream.
    It is still really in its earliest stages of creating a 
whole new bureau and activity and policy and regulations. The 
key difficulty is how you scope it because the number of 
transactions that would be affected as drafted are in the 
millions, and trying to create a licensing structure or a 
CFIUS-like safe harbor approach would require the creation of a 
whole new department. And there is also the general issue of 
ensuring that any type of regulatory authority, if the 
discretion is so broad that it will create perpetual clouds 
over the use and acquisition of electronics and other 
information equipment in the United States.
    So the principle and the policy are terrific. It closes the 
gap. Congress should speak. But it is about resources, scoping, 
and a clear mandate, particularly, by the way, with respect to 
protecting personal data, for which there is not a clear 
regulatory structure and export controls, and CFIUS and 
sanctions really do not have the tools to do that.
    Senator Warner. I appreciate that. I have obviously been 
working on a bipartisan approach that I will hopefully roll out 
shortly. But in some of this terminology from my colleagues, 
IEEPA is a bill that goes back to the '60s [unclear] 
authorities. But it has been modified by the so-called ``Berman 
Amendments'' in the late '80s, particularly around 
communication technologies, put some limits on IEEPA. Mr. 
Trump's ICTS executive order again has some challenges because 
it falls under this IEEPA/Berman framework. I think to get at 
an entity like TikTok or other communication entities we are 
going to need maybe a higher standard where we do not have the 
kind of traditional entity list designation. Or even we have 
seen like with the FCC when they went after Huawei, that is a 
single entity but it is not a comprehensive interagency 
approach.
    Mr. Wolf, I know we are down to the last 30 seconds. I just 
want to, for my colleagues, point out our current structure 
just does not, in a holistic way, particularly take on these 
technologies that are in communication states, and I have grave 
concerns with the level of investment that China is making. The 
challenge of who will be successful will be who controls 
communication technologies, who controls satellites, who 
controls artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and I do 
not believe, unless we continue with the current Whack-A-Mole 
approach that we have got the tools at hand. I hope to work 
with all my colleagues on how we might more comprehensively 
address this.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Warner.
    Senator Vance, of Ohio, is recognized.
    Senator Vance. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Singh, I want to direct my questions to you. I just 
want to ask about the Russian sanctions, in particular, whether 
they have been effective or ineffective. And I want to just, as 
a backdrop here, offer a few pieces of information.
    Last March, a month into the war in Ukraine, President 
Biden went to the Royal Castle in Warsaw and built a sanction 
regime that he said represented a, quote, ``new kind of 
economic statecraft with the power to inflict damage that 
rivals military might.'' I certainly hope he was wrong because 
if he was not then I am a bit more worried about our military 
might than I was before I just read this quote. Because look, 
the issue here is that the sanctions, if you look at the 
numbers, have clearly not matched up with what the Biden 
administration predicted.
    So a couple of pieces of information. Biden swore that the 
Russian economy would be, quote, ``cut in half.'' The White 
House predicted that last year the Russian economy would shrink 
by 15 percent or more. In fact, it shrank just 2.2 percent. 
Biden, I believe, said that the Russian ruble would be reduced 
to rubble. In fact, the Russian ruble is one of the best-
performing international currencies in the world today, and 
compared to our dollar is worth the same that it was when the 
invasion began a little over a year ago.
    You were the architect of these sanctions, so I would like 
to better understand the approach that you advised President 
Biden to take. But first I would like your candid assessment. 
Do you think that these sanctions have been effective?
    Mr. Singh. Thank you, Senator. I think the sanctions are 
doing their job. They are not the only tool we are deploying. 
The most important ones are helping Ukraine fight for its 
freedom, enlarging and fortifying NATO's eastern flank, helping 
the world get off of Russian energy, welcoming the millions of 
refugees flowing into Europe. And, you know, these are the 
tools that, in tandem, can make a difference. But when it comes 
to sanctions, yes, I think they are doing their job.
    You are correct, sir, that the decline in Russia's GDP, 2.2 
percent last year, is lower than what many expected, including 
me. But as I mentioned previously, I think what Putin has done 
is created the Potemkin facade. He has propped up this year's 
growth by sacrificing his long-term growth potential. How? 
Capital controls. If you have a ruble in Russia it is very 
difficult to convert that to a dollar. If you cannot access 
dollars you cannot import anything. Without imports, Russia 
cannot modernize or diversify its economy. Russia weaponized 
energy. That, of course, pushed up energy prices. That 
flattered net exports. That flattered GDP growth. But he has 
lost half of his energy customers, and oil and gas revenues are 
down 50 percent, year over year.
    And then the last thing he did is he spiked government 
spending by 60 percent. You can do that to prop up GDP growth, 
but you will deplete national savings. You will drive up 
inflation. You will drive up interest rates.
    We have degraded his military-industrial complex. We have 
cutoff Russia from its major energy consumer in Europe.
    Senator Vance. Let me unpack a couple of points there. So 
certainly take the point that perhaps the Russian long-term 
economic damage has been there, but it is a little concerning 
for us as policymakers when the Administration says that these 
sanctions are going to effectively a military-grade deployment 
into the Russian economy. And then you look at the top-line 
data and that just has not been borne out, and I worry about 
that. I also worry--I spoke to an international relations 
scholar yesterday who really expressed some concern about 
whether America's deployment of sanctions in this particular 
context and the failure to see obvious short-term benefit to 
the Americans, obvious short-term damage, or at least nearly as 
significant as short-term damage to the Russians, actually 
causes some credibility issues with our own government.
    Just a couple of other questions here. I wonder when you 
guys were thinking about designing these sanctions if you maybe 
underweighted and understated the importance of manufacturing, 
mining, the sort of real sectors of the economy that are much 
more important when you are developing a war economy than, let 
us say, finance or technology, or at least digital technology.
    I am sort of curious there. How do you think about that, 
because you mentioned the Russian industrial base being 
degraded. But when I look at Russians having a 6-to-1 artillery 
advantage against the Ukrainians, and being able to, apparently 
as far as the eye can see, develop artillery munitions in a way 
where already America's stocks are being depleted. It looks, on 
the ground, as if the Russians continue to have not just an 
artillery advantage today but will plausibly have an artillery 
advantage 6 months in the future.
    Did you guys underweight the importance of manufacturing, 
mining, sort of the older economy according to a lot of people, 
but the economy that actually matters when you are fighting a 
war?
    Mr. Singh. Thank you, Senator. It is a good question. You 
know, look. We designed the sanctions to apply pressure where 
we have a strength that intersects with Russia's vulnerability. 
So foreign capital is one of those areas. Cutting-edge 
technology was a second. And yes, we have gotten into supply 
chains where we feel like we had collective leverage over 
Russia.
    But, you know, look. I think as it relates to the 
battlefield impact, we will never know because the intelligence 
on the ground in Russia is so sparse. But every indication that 
I have seen is that he is running out of precision-guided 
munitions, running out of avionics, night-vision goggles, 
satellites, tank production, car production, and he is having 
to rely on industrial goods like dishwashers and breast pumps 
to actually function his equipment in his military. He is 
relying on North Korea and Iran to substitute for the kind of 
technology you need to prosecute a war of this scale. 
Meanwhile, we are supplying the most sophisticated weaponry 
that we can to Ukraine.
    So I think we are giving leverage to Ukraine on the 
battlefield. That is really where it matter most. Sanctions 
will never be a substitute for that kind of support.
    Senator Warren [presiding]. Thank you. I have been left 
with the Chairman's gavel so I recognize Senator Warren.
    So ransomware has hit everywhere. In the past 3 months 
alone, ransomware attacks have shut down four public schools in 
Nantucket, Massachusetts, affecting 1,700 students and their 
families, they have exposed the health records of over 3 
million patients in California, and they have shuttered all 
four of Dole's food production plants in the United States, 
halting food shipments to grocery stores and disrupting our 
already vulnerable supply chain. That is just in the last 3 
months. Let us do the last 24 hours. Just yesterday we learned 
that ransomware attackers stole sensitive investigative 
information from the U.S. Marshal's Service.
    According to FinCEN, in the first half of 2021 along, 
ransomware attackers likely received $5.2 billion--that is in 
half a year--in payments from American businesses, hospitals, 
school systems, and public utilities. Before 2016, the majority 
of cybercrime attacks involved small-scale credit fraud and 
bank fraud. Ransom payments ranged from about $75 to about 
$750. Today the average ransomware attacker demands about $5 
million.
    Mr. Singh, you are an expert on international economics and 
national security. These large-scale attacks and large ransom 
payouts, would they be possible without crypto?
    Mr. Singh. No, Senator. I think digital assets are central 
to the business model of ransomware.
    Senator Warren. OK. And, in fact, do you know what 
proportion of ransomware attacks are paid off by crypto?
    Mr. Singh. It must be close to 100 percent.
    Senator Warren. Exactly right, right at 100 percent. The 
most active ransomware gangs are affiliated with or based in 
Russia, North Korea, and Iran. Mr. Singh, does that put our 
national security at risk?
    Mr. Singh. Absolutely.
    Senator Warren. Thank you. In fact, in 2021, about three-
quarters of all ransomware revenues--that is now measured in 
billions and billions of dollars--three-quarters of it went to 
Russia-linked ransomware gangs. In the year since Russia 
invaded Ukraine, Russian criminal organizations have doubled 
down on using crypto to hold American businesses, American 
schools, American hospitals hostage. Some have even declared 
allegiance to Vladimir Putin, vowing, quote, ``to strike back 
at critical infrastructures of Russia's enemies.'' And just 
last week a Russia-affiliated ransomware gang called Black Cat 
attacked 13 hospitals in eastern Pennsylvania.
    Mr. Singh, I have one more question for you. You helped 
craft the sanctions that our country imposed on Russia, that 
you were just talking about with Senator Vance. You helped 
craft this in response to the Ukraine invasion. Is crypto 
allowing Russian ransomware gangs to extort American businesses 
and potentially evade those sanctions?
    Mr. Singh. Senator, I do not believe it is allowing for the 
evasion of sanctions at scale, but even a dollar of evasion is 
not something we ought to tolerate. And I think as I reflect 
upon the experience one of the efforts we made in parallel was 
to launch the executive order on digital asset regulation and 
also trying to push our government to launch a digital dollar, 
which I think is the single best step that we could take 
because it would crowd out the ecosystem of crypto that allows 
national security adversaries like Russia to exploit our 
deficiencies, our weaknesses in terms of our critical 
infrastructure, and yes, I think to some extent we will not 
know exactly for sure, to evade the impact of our sanctions.
    Senator Warren. Actually, let me just drill down just a 
little bit on this. In March 2022, FinCEN issued an advisory 
warning about Russian attempts to evade sanctions. The 
guidance, and I am going to quote, ``Sanctioned persons, 
illicit actors, and their related networks or facilitators may 
attempt to use crypto and anonymizing tools to evade U.S. 
sanctions and protect their assets around the globe,'' end 
quote.
    And in September 2021, OFAC issued an advisory highlighting 
the sanctions risks associated with ransomware payments. And if 
I am not mistaken, you were serving in the White House at this 
time. Do you agree with these statements from FinCEN and OFAC?
    Mr. Singh. Yeah, I do.
    Senator Warren. Good. You know, crypto is being used to 
hold American businesses for ransom, it is being used to 
threaten American towns, it is being used to evade American 
sanctions, and it is being used to enrich America's 
adversaries. We have got to stop helping these guys by letting 
crypto go unchecked.
    Senator Roger Marshall and I are reintroducing our crypto 
anti-money laundering bill to protect our Nation from 
ransomware attacks by stopping the flow of dirty money. It is 
something we need to do for our national security.
    Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Brown [presiding]. Thank you, Senator Warren.
    Senator Hagerty, from Tennessee, is recognized.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome to 
our guests today.
    Over the past year we have seen the blatant disregard of a 
nation's sovereignty by Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine. 
And right here in the United States we have seen an invasion of 
our own sovereignty, as a CCP spy balloon was allowed to float 
over our Nation for a number of days, including over sensitive 
military sites in my home State of Tennessee. In the case of 
Russia, I was pleased to see the Administration apply sanctions 
to key Russian sectors such as its finance and energy sectors, 
sectors which were used to fuel Russia's aggression in Ukraine.
    In contrast, China has simply received a slap on the wrist, 
at best, for its complete and illegal violation of our U.S. 
sovereignty. To date, only six--again, just six entities from 
China have been added to the Department of Commerce entity 
list, and zero sanctions have been applied to the PLA, to the 
state-owned enterprises, and to the other entities that 
supported developing this balloon and its payload.
    It is well known that China's space sector writ large is 
entirely administered by, or at least works in close 
coordination with the CCP's People's Liberation Army. If that 
is not damning enough, the Administration was forced to 
sanction a Chinese space entity, Spacety, for providing support 
to the Russian military. I would note that if you just took a 
look at Spacety's website you will see that they directly 
partner with China's nuclear weapons manufacturers, their 
defense universities, and the state-owned enterprises that 
directly support the PLA.
    Mr. Singh, my first question is for you. Do you believe the 
Administration should be doing more to hold the People's 
Republic of China, to include its space sector, accountable for 
violating our sovereignty and our national security? I would 
appreciate a yes or no answer, please.
    Mr. Singh. Senator, I will be concise. I mean, to the 
extent that we have evidence of which entities were involved 
with the violation of our sovereignty, we have any number of 
tools that we can consider deploying.
    Senator Hagerty. Should we do more?
    Mr. Singh. I have not seen the forensics but we certainly 
have the capacity.
    Senator Hagerty. I think it is clear to the American public 
more is needed to be done.
    Mr. Singh, I will stay with you on this. You are one of the 
chief architects of the economic sanctions imposed by the 
United States on Russia, as Senator Warren just highlighted. 
Under what conditions would you recommend this Administration 
consider sectoral sanctions against other adversaries like the 
People's Republic of China?
    Mr. Singh. Senator, so the conversation about what tools to 
use has to start with the strategy. What is the objective? So 
for any target the question is are we trying to deter an 
activity? Are we trying to impose maximal costs? Are we trying 
to degrade their ability to project power? Are we trying to 
create a demonstration effect? Once we have identified our 
objective and our strategy then we get into a discussion about 
tools, and different tools take advantage of our strengths than 
others. And we have to think about this in terms of a 
multiplayer repeated game. We have moves we can make. So do our 
adversaries.
    The kind of analysis that I think is needed is to simulate 
how a conflict scenario plays out. How do we use economic 
statecraft, how do we use our military, our military channels, 
what kind of diplomatic avenues are available. And it is 
looking at the totality of the options available to use that 
will, I think, guide, should guide the way in which we approach 
targeting countries like Russia.
    Senator Hagerty. I understand that. My interest right now 
is on the People's Republic of China, though. You have been 
aggressive with respect to Russia and the sanctions applied 
there. I certainly encourage you to take a damn hard look at 
what the PRC is doing, particularly after they violated our 
sovereignty as they have.
    Mr. Wolf, I want to turn to you. The question is being that 
you are the only witness here today that has worked at BIS, do 
you think it is appropriate for this Administration to allow 
U.S. technologies to be exported to China, technologies that 
advance the People's Liberation Army's military modernization 
efforts, including its near-space and its space programs?
    Mr. Wolf. No, of course. There has been a comprehensive 
embargo on the export of such items to China for decades. And 
with respect to otherwise commercial civil items, that is 
actually sort of at the essence of my testimony, to increase 
the effectiveness of the concern you are describing, to get 
items that are made outside the United States, without U.S. 
technology subject to comparable controls for the same reasons.
    Senator Hagerty. How would you suggest the BIS step it up 
and stop the flow of technology that is going to China right 
now?
    Mr. Wolf. One is the regular investigation that is 
described in parties that you are referring to and using the 
entity list aggressively once the evidence is identified of 
somebody providing support to what you have just described. And 
second, I think more importantly, since the United States does 
not have a monopoly on the inputs that are needed for that 
activity is to continue working with the allies to share 
information, evidence, declassified intelligence so that they 
understand and share the same threat, and more importantly have 
the legal authorities under their systems in order to be able 
to impose controls their countries, over their items. And that 
will dramatically enhance the effectiveness of the concern you 
rightly point out.
    Senator Hagerty. Got it. Thank you, Mr. Wolf. Thank you, 
Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you.
    Senator Van Hollen, of Maryland, is recognized.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you 
and the Ranking Member for holding this hearing. Thank you to 
all of our witnesses.
    Mr. Singh, you made the point earlier that we have a lot of 
positive incentives to offer countries in terms of our global 
interaction, diplomacy, development, incentives for more 
economic investment by America's private sector, security 
assistance, but that sanctions are an important tool. I think 
we all recognize that we have to put sanctions in context that 
it is one tool but a very important tool, and I think all of 
you have made those points.
    I would like to follow up on the issue of the price cap. I 
thought this was an innovative approach, taken by the Biden 
administration with our G7 partners. I want to applaud the 
Europeans for recognizing the importance of moving off of 
Russian oil after too long of a dependence of many of those 
countries on Russian oil. And I did hear your testimony, Mr. 
Singh, pointing out that the Russian revenue year over year has 
dropped 50 percent from the export of crude oil. And, of 
course, this was only put in place in December, so we have not 
yet seen the reduction in oil revenues captured in Russia's 
overall GDP figures. We will have to see what impact that has 
over the next year. And, of course, they just put in place the 
refined petroleum products.
    But as with all sanctions there are people who are already 
fast at work trying to evade them, and obviously Russia has an 
interest in selling above the price cap. Can you talk about 
additional enforcement measures you might take? Former Senator 
Toomey and I were looking at a number of secondary sanctions 
options. They have plusses and minuses. But we also know that 
there are efforts to circumvent the price cap. Can you talk 
about additional measures we can take on the enforcement side?
    Mr. Singh. Yeah, thank you, Senator. So you are right. 
Russia absolutely has an incentive to sell oil above the cap, 
but its customers do not. So we have really given them the gift 
of bargaining power. We have said to them, ``Look, if you pay 
above $60 a barrel you have got to find your own oil service 
providers, for shipping, for insurance, for trade finance. That 
is quite costly.''
    Now, what can we do if there is evasion? You know, look. I 
think over time we can find ways to reduce the price at which 
the cap is set, just to clamp down further on Russia's ability 
to sell at prices that flatter its budget revenues. If lowering 
the cap does not work, and you still have a lot of evasion from 
countries that are importing from Russia, I think we have two 
options. Either we can offer a better price to those countries 
and allow them to meet their energy needs with domestic 
production or maybe from production in third countries. The 
other option is to use quiet, private diplomacy and say, 
``Look, if you are continuing to purchase oil at levels that 
benefit Putin and go against the goals of the cap, which are to 
minimize his revenues while keeping global energy supplies 
constant, we have options, and we can use them.''
    Now I do not think we should threaten countries in public. 
I would use that as a last defense, as a last resort. And I do 
not think we are quite there yet.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, I agree with you, we should be 
steadily reducing the cap, tightening the cap, because I think 
there is still a long way to go to get to that marginal cost of 
production for Russia. Obviously, we want to bring along our 
coalition as part of that.
    Let me turn to China for a moment, and Mr. Wolf and anybody 
else who wants to comment with respect to the Commerce 
Department actions. I was a supporter of the actions that the 
Trump administration took with respect to Huawei, putting them 
on the entities list. I think that did have an impact on 
Huawei, and I really appreciate the Biden administration's 
effort to really broaden the export control list so it does not 
focus just on one company but deals with the exports of highly 
sensitive chips and semiconductors that can be used in China's 
military, and taking a very broad approach, using our sort of 
long-armed power based on origin and U.S. IP to apply these 
restrictions to other countries.
    How effective do you think that has been to date? What can 
we do to further encourage its enforcement? And what is your 
assessment of how we can use that model going forward?
    Mr. Wolf. No, excellent question, and I think today it has 
been very effective because the Commerce Department used an 
all-of-the-above strategy of controlling exports from the 
United States, controlling activities of U.S. persons, 
controlling foreign-made items that are made with U.S. 
technology and software, and it has been extraordinarily 
effective.
    The main essence of my prepared remarks is to make such 
controls more effective, and as importantly, less 
counterproductive for U.S. industry to convince the allies, who 
also produce similar technologies and have people that can 
provide similar services, to adopt in their systems the same 
types of prohibitions, to level the playing field for U.S. 
industry and to deprive the end users in China that you are 
referring to of the items of concern. And your question is 
evidence of this broader than classical strategic export 
control concept that I referred to at the beginning, of a new 
way of thinking that is needed, and the United States should 
take the lead in articulating with its close allies.
    So it has been very effective but there is a lot more to be 
done. And on the enforcement it will be inherently difficult 
because you are dealing with essentially commercial items that 
are very small, that are foreign made, that are outside the 
United States, and getting corporate into commercial items. And 
again, this is where an equal degree of coordination and 
alignment of allied export control enforcement authorities, 
which trail behind the licensing and policy officials, is 
absolutely critical.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Daines, from Montana, is recognized.
    Senator Daines. Chairman, thank you. Thanks for being here 
today.
    Earlier this month Larry Summers, of course the former 
Secretary of Treasury in the Clinton administration, Director 
of Economic Policy there under Obama--by the way, it was Larry 
Summers that we were recording right here in this room 2 years 
ago, when we were debating the $1.9 trillion purely partisan 
spending package, where Larry Summers said, ``That is going to 
cause inflation.'' We were raising the alarm bells then. So I 
listen when Larry Summers speaks. I listen because he was 
certainly a prophet on what happened after that massive 
spending bill passed in this Senate 2 years ago.
    But he was discussing Russia's seizing of German assets 
after World War II, and the seizure of Iraqi assets to help 
rebuild Kuwait after the Gulf War, and he was discussing with 
Bloomberg. And he said this, and I quote, ``I believe that if 
this sets a precedent that continues, that countries that 
engage in naked, cross-border aggression will lose their state 
assets. That is a precedent that I think is a very healthy 
precedent to set,'' end quote, and I agree with Larry Summers.
    Yesterday I reintroduced legislation that would do just 
this and repurpose frozen Russian assets to help pay for U.S. 
aid provided to Ukraine as a result of Russia's invasion. And I 
look forward to working with my colleagues on advancing this 
and/or related legislation to hold Russia accountable and make 
it pay for the war they started.
    A question for each of you. Research shows that Russia's 
crude fetched an average of roughly $74 a barrel in the 4 weeks 
that followed a price cap of $60 per barrel. Please tell me, 
are you aware of any sanctions or enforcement mechanisms that 
have been put in place regarding the Russian oil price cap, and 
if so, what penalties have been collected?
    Start with you, Mr. Singh.
    Mr. Singh. Senator, I will answer your question. I first 
want to say I agree with you. We need to look at all creative 
ways possible to make Russia pay its fair share for the 
reconstruction of Ukraine, which is probably going to be in the 
hundreds of billions of dollars. And if that means using the 
central bank reserves that we immobilized as collateral for 
Ukraine to issue debt, I think that is something we ought to 
pursue.
    Senator Daines. What are the odds of us prevailing, 
actually collecting that? I mean, talk is cheap, but actions 
here----
    Mr. Singh. I agree. One idea, Senator, would be to use the 
reserves that we have immobilized at the New York Fed. They are 
in our possession. Transfer them to Ukraine. Allow Ukraine to 
put up those assets as collateral to raise new money, in 
amounts that would far exceed our capacity to provide, or that 
of our allies, or the World Bank or the IMF, for that matter. 
To me that is a twist on the Brady plan that worked in the 
early 1980s, and it should be re-imagined for today's 
circumstances.
    Senator Daines. Thank you. Mr. Lowery, thoughts?
    Mr. Lowery. So on the price cap question, Mr. Singh 
mentioned earlier, has there been evasion, so to speak? So in 
some respects the answer is yes and the answer is no. The 
answer on the no part is obviously not every country said, 
``Hey, we are going to go on with this cap.'' There were a 
number of countries who have said they are willing to do it, 
but there are a number of countries who said they are not 
willing to do it.
    On the yes is the will there be evasion? Absolutely there 
will be. So how does the price cap work? The price cap works 
through an insurance mechanism, basically. And so there are 
other insurers out there that are not necessarily part of 
Europe. There are insurers that are going to be created that 
are not part of Europe. There are ships that will be able to 
take the cargo to countries and be able to evade the sanctions. 
Now at this point in time, Russia has been offering discounts 
anyway prior to the price cap that kind of brought the price 
down below $60 a barrel, on aggregate. That does not mean there 
are not individual parts where they are not.
    So at this point there probably has been some sanctions 
evasion. I think most of that sanctions evasion is happening 
from those that are saying, ``We are not willing to put in 
place this price cap.'' And has there been enforcement 
mechanisms? The price cap is very, very new. It has only been 
in place for a couple of months, on oil shipments, not on 
petroleum products, which has only been in place for a couple 
of weeks.
    So I think that enforcement is a very important point. It 
is an important point for all of the sanctions conversations we 
have been having throughout this conversation.
    Senator Daines. Yeah. Thank you. I am out of time here, but 
just 2 days ago Secretary Summers, in fact, was cited in 
Bloomberg indicating that current economic sanctions were 
failing to provide a deterrent to Russia's aggression and seems 
to indicate that more aggressive limits or further measures may 
be needed. So I am out of time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Daines.
    Senator Britt, of Alabama, is recognized.
    Senator Britt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, 
gentlemen, for being with us today.
    Before we start talking about sanctions I wanted to take a 
moment to talk about the Committee on Foreign Investments in 
the United States. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
noted that foreign investors now owned over 40 million acres of 
our farmland. This has occurred since 2015, at a tune of about 
2.2 million acres a year.
    I have heard from many Alabamians as I have traveled across 
the State, and this is a concern for them, specifically the 
Chinese Communist Party and their willingness and their efforts 
and deliberate and intentional attempts to buy up fertile U.S. 
farmlands.
    I believe food security is national security. Food security 
is economic security. So I believe that one acre of our 
farmland owned by the Chinese Communist Party is one acre too 
many. Additionally, I think there is another layer of national 
security concerns that we are allowing China to buy up farmland 
near our military installations. It is completely and totally 
unacceptable.
    So my question, Mr. Lowery, for you, as a former chair of 
CFIUS, when it comes to ensuring we have a strong agriculture 
voice at the table when these decisions are being made, do you 
agree that it is reasonable that the Secretary of Agriculture 
should be involved as a member of CFIUS?
    Mr. Lowery. I think it is totally reasonable, yes. And as I 
mentioned earlier, if CFIUS needed to bring in Agriculture 
right now they can do it on an ad hoc basis. But to the point 
that you have made, and a number of Senators have made, it 
sounds to me like this probably should be looked at in a more 
systematic way.
    Senator Britt. Yes. We need a permanent seat at the table 
because it is absolutely unacceptable when you look, I believe, 
probably say with great confidence that the Chinese Communist 
Party is not allowing the United States of America to buy up 
their farmland, particularly near their military installations.
    So on that line of questioning, under CFIUS it is almost 
always national security agreements. They are issued instead of 
outright blocking foreign companies from acquiring U.S. 
companies or engaging in transactions that are assessed to have 
these national security implications. You know, we issued these 
agreements first. And my question to you is, how does CFIUS 
enforce a national security agreement and what are the 
consequences for failing to adhere to the terms of those 
agreements?
    Mr. Lowery. So if you look at most of the numbers, CFIUS 
reviewed, in 2021, which is the last year we have, 275 
transactions. Of those 275 transactions, about 10 percent of 
them, roughly 30, transactions had what you just described, 
mitigation agreements. So that means basically that the 
government had concerns about the transaction but they thought 
the transaction could go through but they wanted to make sure 
that there were specific measures put in place to protect 
national security, potentially, in the future.
    Those national security agreements can last for a long 
time. They are implemented and negotiated by specific agencies 
that have the right type of expertise. So if it is a military 
type of issue, the Department of Defense will negotiate it. If 
it is something on information technology issues, most likely 
the Department of Justice or maybe Homeland Security will do 
it. They follow these agreements up through monitoring 
mechanisms, auditing mechanisms, from third-party auditors, and 
if there are violations of the mitigation agreements they do 
have the capability to, one, obviously, step in and do 
something, including they could actually divest the transaction 
way after the fact, or, more likely, they could do something 
like, they could do a fine, they could do warnings to basically 
see, kind of make sure you get your house in order type of 
problem.
    So that is kind of how it works, and I think there are 
roughly about 200 mitigation agreements from past that are in 
effect. Every now and then some of them roll off because there 
may be somebody else who comes in and purchases it. There is a 
domestic buy.
    Senator Britt. OK. So question actually for each of you. 
During your time in government, were there violations of these 
mitigation agreements? Just yes or no.
    Mr. Wolf. No, but there were not the same enforcement 
authorities that were created after I left in 2018.
    Senator Britt. OK.
    Mr. Wolf. So I cannot properly answer.
    Senator Britt. OK.
    Mr. Wolf. There were violations that we noticed when I was 
there, just like Kevin said, that some of this has become 
tougher over time. But there had been violation of the 
agreements, and usually they were worked out through mechanisms 
of--they were not egregious violations, is probably the best 
way. They were violations, and there are things that happened 
that are just mistakes. So the parties usually would work that 
out with the agency that was in charge, who would report it 
back to the overall CFIUS committee to make sure that everybody 
was aware.
    Senator Britt. OK.
    Mr. Singh. Much like Mr. Lowery said, I do not recall 
intentional egregious violations, but I do believe mistakes 
were made that had to be corrected.
    Senator Britt. OK. Thank you all for your time.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Britt.
    Senator Cramer, of North Dakota, is recognized.
    Senator Cramer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, 
for having this important hearing. Thank you all for your 
expertise and sharing it with us.
    I am the one person at the end of the table who has just 
lived the long CFIUS nightmare in Grand Forks, North Dakota. 
And I cannot tell you how disappointing it was and, frankly, 
how consequential it was for CFIUS, after not just the 45-day 
review but then another 20 days added to get further 
information, all of which sends signals, of course, that were 
missed by local leaders, unfortunately, but only to conclude, 
clumsily, non-jurisdiction over an agribusiness 12 miles from 
an ISR military base and a low earth orbiting satellite ground 
station. The outcome of that was the completion of a sale that 
should have never taken place. Now, that sale should have never 
been begun by local leaders, and they should have, you know, 
listened to a lot of people, including me, prior to the Air 
Force finally correcting CFIUS's error, and stating 
emphatically in a letter this poses a significant risk to the 
Grand Forks Air Force Base.
    So I am with all of my colleagues who have said that the 
Secretary of Agriculture should be a permanent member of CFIUS. 
If food supply chain is not a critical supply chain, nothing 
is. You know, food is so darn important maybe it should be a 
member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but that is another 
committee I am on.
    So anyway, we are deeply disappointed and I hope we can--
and I think we do have strong bipartisan support for 
strengthening agriculture's role on CFIUS.
    That said, I want to actually talk about something else for 
a little bit, and that is the role of domestic energy 
production and export as a means to bringing global price down. 
I long for the day when the WTI is the global index, and I 
think we should do that, and I think we can do that by flooding 
the market with American oil, for example, and gas, and selling 
it to our friends and frenemies alike, that will bring down the 
price for all of us
    That said, one of the means that I am interested in, that I 
have been working on, is a carbon border adjustment mechanism 
that recognizes the high price that our carbon-intensive 
companies already pay for a higher environmental standard, as 
well as other high standards like labor and workplace 
standards, and joining forces with our friends that have 
similar standards, and instead of punishing ourselves and 
manipulating, hopefully, the behavior of the polluters, which 
just also happen to be our adversaries in most cases.
    I favor a much simpler approach than a lot of others 
because I am a simple guy and I can understand simple things. 
But I might just be interested in each of you, and I will start 
with you, Mr. Wolf, since you have sort of managed some of 
these tariffs--I call this a pollution tariff--what your 
thoughts are on the possibility of some sort of a pollution 
tariff or a CBAM, that recognizes our high cost of production.
    Mr. Wolf. Apologies. It is not an issue I have focused on 
or thought about, so I will defer to my colleagues.
    Senator Cramer. All right. Mr. Lowery.
    Mr. Lowery. I think it is an interesting issue. It does 
strike me that you are going to have to then start thinking 
about how to come up with a price for carbon, and as we all 
know that is a dicey issue. It is hard to do, and we are not 
there yet. So in order to have some sort of border adjustment 
mechanism I think you are going to have to figure out how to 
find a price for carbon.
    Senator Cramer. What about what Europe has done to this 
point? I wish we could have caught up or we could have done it 
in sync with each other. Clearly the price of carbon sends up 
all kinds of red flags, especially in my energy-producing oil, 
gas, coal-powered State of North Dakota. But this is, again, 
where I think, can we find something that does not punish our 
own clean producers but changes behavior? Mr. Singh, thoughts 
on the possibilities?
    Mr. Singh. Senator, yeah, I think there are two approaches 
out there. One is do you set the tariff by your cost of 
regulatory compliance. That tends to be the European approach. 
The one that I think has more appeal is how much have you 
actually done to reduce your emissions as a country. That is 
what matters, right?
    Senator Cramer. Right.
    Mr. Singh. And so depending on how much progress you have 
made in reducing what actually impacts the environment, that 
determines the degree to which you impose a border adjustment 
tax. So I think that is a tool--I think you are right, Senator. 
This is a tool that we need to think about and refine. To my 
mind, the latter approach is the way forward.
    Senator Cramer. Excellent. Thank you.
    Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Cramer.
    Before we adjourn I just wanted to say that I thank Senator 
Britt for sitting through this whole hearing. It is an unusual 
occurrence, and she really did ask incisive questions, and I am 
guessing she learned a lot because these witnesses, all three 
of them, are so good. She already knows a lot so she learned 
even more. So I wanted to call her out for that.
    Thanks to the witnesses for being here. Senators who wish 
to submit questions for the record, those questions are due 1 
week from today, March 7th. For the witnesses, you have 45 days 
to respond to any questions.
    Thank you. This was a particularly good hearing and the 
responses of all three of you. Thank you. We are adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:49 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

additional material supplied for the record follow:]
              PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERROD BROWN
    Last week marked 1 year since Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal, 
criminal war on Ukraine.
    Putin wanted to jeopardize the future of a sovereign democracy, and 
in the process, to threaten the world order--an order based on freedom, 
democracy, and the rule of law.
    But Putin was surprised by two things--the resilience of the 
Ukrainian people, and President Biden's ability to put together, and 
keep together, a broad, consistent international coalition to support 
the Ukrainian people as they defend their country.
    Last week, I met with Ukrainian-Americans in Greater Cleveland.
    My State is proud to have a vibrant, active Ukrainian unity. And 
Ohioans' message to me was clear: we must maintain our resolve. And we 
must continue to hold the Russian government accountable, along with 
all those who enable its war on Ukraine.
    I agree.
    We cannot waiver in our commitment to Ukraine, and I am glad that 
President Biden, Leader Schumer, and Leader McConnell all made clear 
their support last week.
    Many of our colleagues of both parties were overseas last week, all 
showing united, bipartisan support. Our commitment to the Ukrainian 
people and our resolve to stand up to Putin has never been partisan.
    We must also recognize that Putin's brutal war is the most recent 
assault that authoritarians are launching around the world.
    And all their eyes are on our response in Eastern Europe right now.
    NATO General Secretary said last month, ``If President Putin wins 
in Ukraine, this would send a message that authoritarian regimes can 
achieve their goals by brute force . . . Beijing is watching closely. 
And learning lessons that may influence its future decisions.''
    It's what the Administration's National Security Strategy outlined 
as, ``a strategic competition to shape the future of the international 
order.''
    Today's hearing is about how we use economic tools like sanctions, 
export controls, and investment screening to advance and protect U.S. 
national security and foreign policy.
    In addition to the humanitarian and military assistance the United 
States and our allies have provided to Ukraine, our response to Putin's 
war centered on the significant sanctions and export controls we have 
imposed to ensure that Russia--not the rest of the world--bears the 
full costs of Putin's illegal invasion.
    These measures are imposing real costs on Russia. Treasury Deputy 
Secretary Wally Adeyemo put it pretty well last week: ``our actions are 
forcing Russia to mortgage its economic future to save face today.''
    We, of course, recognize that not all economies are the same.
    Our work is complex, as we confront the challenges posed by 
President Xi and the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing.
    Twenty-five years ago, Senator Graham and I led efforts in the 
House to oppose China's accession to the World Trade Organization.
    Corporations, in search of even bigger profits shut down 
manufacturing in Ohio and across the United States, moved production to 
China.
    It contributed to the industrialization of China. And it's funded 
the buildup of the Chinese military.
    I've challenged the failed China policy of administrations of both 
parties. It was obvious to some of us then, what all of us see now--
that China poses a real threat to our economic security--look at 
Columbiana County in Ohio. Look at Clarendon County in South Carolina.
    Now the serious national security threats are also obvious.
    The Chinese Government made its aims clear: to dominate advanced 
technology and global strategic supply chains.
    The Chinese Communist Party's civil-military fusion policy erases 
the line separating commercial and military use of finished goods--and 
of the technologies that go into them.
    And we have seen Beijing ramp up its activities in the South China 
Sea and Taiwan Strait while oppressing its own citizens. And now we are 
even seeing Chinese Communist Party officials meeting with Putin, and 
consistently refusing to condemn his invasion of Ukraine.
    Whether in Beijing or Moscow, Iran or North Korea--whether it's to 
address IP theft, human rights abusers, or foreign traffickers of 
illicit fentanyl, we need a robust economic policy to deter and disrupt 
behavior that hurts U.S. national security interests.
    In this Committee, I have worked with colleagues in both parties to 
restrict U.S. technology or financing from being used in ways that harm 
U.S. national security interests.
    On a bipartisan basis, this Committee led reforms to strengthen our 
investment screening process conducted by the Committee on Foreign 
Investment in the United States--CFIUS. We provided permanent statutory 
authority for the Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, to 
administer and enforce our export control system.
    And last Congress, Ranking Member Toomey and I led this Committee's 
work to prohibit the importation of Russian gold, impose sanctions 
regarding human rights abuses by Iran, and expand BIS's authority to 
limit exports to foreign militaries, intelligence services, and 
security forces.
    And we took action last year to remove most-favored-nation trade 
status from Russia. Actions have economic consequences.
    I hope that we'll continue this strong history of bipartisan work 
on important national and economic security issues in this Committee's 
jurisdiction over the next 2 years with Ranking Member Scott.
    Today, in this hearing, we have a chance to take that first step by 
examining how we use our economic toolkit to advance the breadth of 
issues that impact our U.S. national security and foreign policy.
    We must use the tools we have to deter or disrupt behavior that 
undermines U.S. national security.
    We need to do that while we strengthen our partnership with 
countries that share our values for free markets and democracy. And we 
need to do that while not harming U.S. economic and technological 
leadership.

                PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR TIM SCOTT
    The topic of today's hearing could not be more timely. Last [week] 
marked the 1-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Over 
this past year, we've seen the horrors of war and the brutal loss of 
life, but we've also seen the strength of the Ukrainian people. Their 
fight against tyranny and oppression to seek and maintain their 
independence is inspiring and reminds me of our own intrinsic values 
that inform American patriotism--the hope for a better future.
    We are fortunate enough to live in the greatest Nation on earth and 
must always be vigilant to protect and promote national and economic 
security--the underpinnings of our Nation.
    Preserving our status as a world leader requires the continual 
honing and sharpening of our economic security tools in order to 
preserve and protect the role of America at home and abroad. These 
tools are often pushed beyond our everyday conversations. Folks don't 
always bring up sanctions at the dinner table, at least not in my 
house, but they are important to protecting and promoting American 
interests.
    We've seen firsthand, whether it's with Russia or North Korea, that 
the tailored use of sanctions can be an effective foreign policy and 
economic security apparatus.
    Unfortunately, these same tools have been wielded as hammers 
instead of scalpels. Resulting in pushing our adversaries toward closer 
cooperation with each other and further away from us.
    Much like the Obama administration's famous ``red line,'' the Biden 
administration's failure to enforce existing sanctions manifests 
weakness--which is an unacceptable abuse of our Nation's global 
leadership and signals to friend and foe alike that, when we are saying 
something, we may not actually mean it.
    Recent reports of Chinese and Iranian support for Russian weaponry, 
flouting U.S. sanctions, is just another example. If there was ever a 
time to kowtow to our adversaries and their supporters, I assure you: 
it is not today, nor ever.
    National security efforts should support, not detract from, 
American industrial leadership--a commonsense principle. However, 
instead of using American oil and natural gas resources to aid our 
European allies' efforts to cut ties with Russian oil, the Biden 
administration restricted American energy production to promote liberal 
climate change policies--punishing not only our allies, but everyday 
families stuck with higher and higher energy bills.
    When looking at tools like export controls and our investment 
security review process, our goal should be a holistic one that combats 
malign economic aggression.
    Specifically, the Chinese Communist Party has enacted laws 
facilitating the theft and unfair treatment of American innovation. We 
must use our export controls to ensure sensitive technologies are not 
being shared with foreign adversaries--much like we must use the CFIUS 
process to ensure bad actors are not granted undue access under the 
guise of benign foreign investment.
    Economic security requires precision and strength. We must champion 
American economic opportunity. Hard work and ingenuity are two of the 
main drivers of the American dream, the same dream that our adversaries 
are working to stop.
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on this important 
topic. Thank you.

   Former Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, and Former 
   Director of International Finance, Department of the Treasury and 
                       National Security Council
                           February 28, 2023
    Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and Members of the Committee, 
I would like to thank you for the opportunity to testify on Advancing 
National Security and Foreign Policy through Sanctions, Export 
Controls, and other Economic Tools.
    My name is Clay Lowery, and I am currently Executive Vice President 
of the Institute of International Finance (IIF), a trade association 
that represents 400 financial services firms in roughly 65 countries 
across the globe. My testimony today is not on behalf of IIF or any of 
its members and should be considered my own views.
    I served in the U.S. Government from 1994 to 2009, principally with 
the Treasury Department, although I also was the Director of 
International Finance at the National Security Council. From 2005 to 
2009, I served as the Assistant Secretary of International Affairs for 
the Treasury Department, and one of my primary responsibilities was 
overseeing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States 
(CFIUS).
    I am pleased to be testifying alongside Kevin Wolf and Daleep 
Singh, both of whom I respect deeply and of whose views and expertise I 
think highly.
    In my testimony, and as requested by the Committee, I will discuss 
briefly:

  i.  the economic impact on Russia due to the sanctions regime put in 
        place in 2022,

  ii.  some of the lessons that can be drawn for thinking about China, 
        and

  iii.  the idea of an outward-bound investment screening mechanism 
        using the prism of CFIUS.
Sanctions on Russia
    A year ago, Russia invaded Ukraine. In response, the United States, 
along with a number of allies, imposed a set of financial sanctions, 
export controls, and a myriad of other measures to both punish Russia 
and to influence its decision-making. It is arguably the most robust 
financial sanctions package in history: unprecedented in terms of the 
size of the economy being sanctioned, the comprehensiveness of the 
sanctions regime, the multilateral cooperation and implementation, and 
the speed in which the program had been put in place.
    A year later, this has had a substantial economic and financial 
impact on Russia, but it has neither been as dramatic nor as sweeping 
as was estimated last year. While early forecasts--including by my own 
organization--suggested Russia's real GDP would fall by 8 to 15 percent 
of GDP in 2022, it instead contracted by 2 to 3 percent of GDP.
    Why is this the case?
    There are a number of factors that have allowed Russia to overcome 
the most dramatic impact of these sanctions:

  <bullet>  Expansiveness: Although the sanctions regime was expansive, 
        there are still major carve-outs most clearly seen in what was 
        not sanctioned: Russia's major exports--natural gas, oil, and 
        petroleum products. With the rise of prices in those markets 
        and some increase in volumes, it still led to Russia's current 
        account surplus nearly doubling in 2022, which means an extra 
        $100 billion. As an example, just looking at oil exports, my 
        colleague Elina Ribakova, estimates that price differentials 
        accounted for over 85 percent of Russia's oil export revenue 
        growth from 2021 to 2022.
    <bullet>  A significant percentage of the Russian banking system, 
        including the central bank, had their assets frozen, lost 
        access to dollar and euro funding, and eight Russian banks have 
        been removed from the SWIFT messaging system. However, the 
        Russian state--particularly the central bank--adjusted, and 
        assets were diverted to other parts of the financial system 
        that were not sanctioned.
      In short, a current account surplus provided much-needed 
        liquidity to Russia's economy, even though its central bank 
        assets had been frozen. Just as importantly, it also provided 
        revenue to prop up Russia's fiscal position.

  <bullet>  Multilateral Coordination: The Biden administration quickly 
        and successfully put together a multilateral coalition for both 
        sanctions and export controls--impressive, considering that 
        many of these countries' economies are quite dependent on 
        Russian energy. That said, this coordination has neither been 
        consistent enough nor broad enough.
      This can take a number of forms but for brevity, the two most 
        common are the less well-known issues of jurisdictional 
        disparities among sanctions regimes across the world that lead 
        toward deleterious consequences for compliance, and the more 
        prominent issue of significant jurisdictions simply not joining 
        the ``coalition.''
      Addressing the first issue continues to evolve and the G7 has 
        focused on improving consistency, which should help with 
        sanctions avoidance. Whereas the second problem is the area 
        that shows up in the numbers.
      For example, Russian oil export volumes fell across the EU, 
        Japan, Korea, and several other countries. Yet, Russian oil 
        export volumes overall were still up in 2022, as countries such 
        as China, India, and Turkey increased their purchases by enough 
        to make up for these volume losses--and, of course, this does 
        not count my earlier point about price effects.

  <bullet>  Adaptability: The 2022 sanctions package was an extensive 
        expansion of the sanctions package against Russia that has been 
        in place since the 2014 annexation of Crimea. During that time, 
        Russia had built up what has been called ``Fortress Russia''--
        measures to insulate its economy from Western sanctions.
      In addition, the Central Bank of Russia took swift and decisive 
        measures--providing liquidity, doubling its interest rates, 
        putting in place capital controls, and forcing foreign currency 
        deposits to be converted to rubles--that allowed the exchange 
        rate and the banking system to stabilize. And as this stability 
        was realized, a number of these measures were removed.

    Russia's economic and financial resilience in the face of such a 
major sanctions program does not mean that the program was a failure. 
In fact, it seems to be having an impact on Russia's ability to obtain 
war-fighting materials, has led to a ``brain drain'' of skilled Russian 
workers, and is likely to lead to a slow but steady decrease in 
productivity and economic activity for years to come.
Lessons Learned
    Although it is early, the lessons that can be drawn from the 
results of the latest Russian sanctions regime are important. And in 
the context of China, as you have asked me to consider today, they are 
even more stark.
    The key difference, of course, between China and Russia is China's 
economy and overall engagement in the world economy is simply 
magnitudes bigger than Russia's in both scope and scale. To an extent, 
we are comparing an apple to an orange.

  <bullet>  China's GDP is 10 times larger than Russia's;

  <bullet>  China exports are roughly 7 times greater than Russia's and 
        its imports are almost 9 times greater;

  <bullet>  China's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) stock is about 6 
        times greater than Russia, while Its outward-bound investment 
        stock is 5 times the size of Russia's;

  <bullet>  While Russia is a global exporter of natural resources, 
        China has a much more diverse economy, and is much more 
        interconnected with the United States, and most other 
        economies;

  <bullet>  China's commercial banking sector is many times greater 
        than the assets of Russia's banking system and its domestic 
        bond market is much, much larger; and

  <bullet>  Many of the sanctions that were implemented on Russia in 
        2022 were extensions of earlier sanctions imposed in 2014--
        meaning that the U.S. private sector's engagement and 
        investment in the country was already limited. That is not the 
        case in China.

    However, I think we can still draw three key insights from Russia 
as they relate to China:

  1.  China--like Russia--has a significant current account surplus, 
        but instead of being a major commodity exporter, they are the 
        top exporter of manufactured goods. In the last year, the 
        importance of Russia to energy and commodity markets has been 
        clear. Researchers at the Center for Strategic and 
        International Studies estimate that China's share of 
        manufactured exports are more than twice the share of Russia's 
        share of Russia's energy and fuel exports. \1\ Again, a current 
        account surplus is a major reason Russia was able to overcome 
        the most dramatic impact of Western sanctions.

     \1\ 1 Gerard DiPippo and Andrea Leonard Palazzi, ``Bearing the 
Brunt: The Impact of the Sanctions on Russia's Economy and Lessons for 
the Use of Sanctions on China'', CSIS, February 2023.

  2.  International coordination may be more difficult as it relates to 
        China. Throughout the war between Russia and Ukraine, we have 
        seen unprecedented cooperation across the G7 countries and 
        beyond. Where there is common cause among countries to use such 
        tools, it is vital that the official sector is internationally 
        coordinated and coherent, and that certain elements are 
        harmonized across regimes. That said, the design and 
        implementation of sanctions may always elicit differences 
        dependent on wider geopolitical considerations. Each country 
        naturally considers its own interests when participating in a 
        sanctions regime. And while many jurisdictions have been highly 
        motivated to implement sanctions on Russia, we have often seen 
        that it has been a struggle. China's much broader and deeper 
        engagement in the international economic system suggests that 
        this struggle will be much greater and that the motivation to 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        implement sanctions is likely to be weaker.

  3.  This brings me to a third point, which is implementation risk. 
        Even if international coordination is high, sanctions regimes 
        are always complex, and executing them is not like flipping a 
        switch. At the IIF, we have heard from financial services firms 
        across the globe who have been diligently working to understand 
        and properly implement the sanctions regime. From that, we have 
        noticed that there should be a clear focus by authorities on 
        international alignment for such things as prohibitions/lists 
        of sanctioned individuals, sectoral application, and the timing 
        of designations across jurisdictions, alongside coordinated 
        communication on guidance concerning sanctions on a cross-
        border basis. This should be coupled with discussions on how 
        financial crime risk management efforts can be deployed 
        effectively to mitigate the circumvention of sanctions--
        including, inter alia, beneficial ownership transparency, 
        public/private sector information exchange, and the deployment 
        of standards for non-financial businesses and professions.

    The bottom line is that sanctions regimes are difficult to 
implement, multilateral cooperation is complicated--particularly for 
larger economies, and you can't plug every leak. We also know China's 
capability to retaliate economically is significantly greater than 
Russia's.
CFIUS and Outward-Bound investment
    One of the tools that the Administration and Congress has been 
considering to influence our economic relationship with China is an 
outward-bound investment screening mechanism. Some have called it a 
``Reverse CFIUS''. As an individual who oversaw CFIUS for a time in my 
career, I thought I'd try to suggest lessons that could be learned as 
this Congress thinks through it.
    The most important thing to understand about CFIUS is its 
objective: ensuring national security while promoting foreign 
investment. From a policy perspective, this meant to me that 
legislation, operations, and implementation should:

  i.  minimize the opportunity for politicizing transactions,

  ii.  keep CFIUS narrowly focused on national security and resist the 
        impulse to use it for broader economic policy goals, and

  iii.  ensure accountability of the executive branch for protecting 
        national security while welcoming foreign investment.

    I realize that there have been numerous attempts to design 
legislation for an outward-bound investment mechanism in the past few 
years and that the Administration is considering an Executive order to 
create a system. It is not my place--at this time--to make a judgment 
on any specific proposal, but besides the policy goals I note above for 
CFIUS--I think there are a few other lessons that could be drawn as 
either legislation or executive branch action is considered:

  i.  avoid the temptation to use vague and ill-defined terms;

  ii.  don't duplicate existing authorities in an agency or committee 
        with little experience or expertise;

  iii.  understand that there is a resource burden on the Executive 
        branch that makes implementation difficult; and maybe most 
        importantly

  iv.  realize that placing such government controls on private-sector 
        transactions--particularly in cases that have nothing to do 
        with national security--is likely to harm our competitiveness 
        and may prove to be counterproductive to our national security.
Conclusion
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today. I stand ready 
to serve as a resource to the Committee on important issues related to 
economic sanctions and cross-border investment restrictions, and I'd be 
pleased to take any of your questions.

        RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SCOTT
                       FROM DALEEP SINGH

Q.1. The Treasury Department has taken action against thousands 
of small and large Russian entities in the last year. 
Considering our Nation's approach to other bad actors in the 
world, are there applications to how we might look to apply 
lessons from the Russia sanctions to other issues, such as the 
traffickers and cartels in Mexico and chemical companies in 
China that facilitate the deadly flow of fentanyl to the United 
States? Would it be possible to surge analytic resources to our 
economic statecraft tools, similar to how we target Russia, to 
address the deadly flows of fentanyl?

A.1. Response not received in time for publication.

Q.2. When you were in the White House, was there any 
consideration as to how the overuse of sanctions with a 
nonstrategic purpose could affect U.S. standing and business 
development in growing economies such as Brazil and Indonesia?

A.2. Response not received in time for publication.

Q.3. I have been alarmed by reports of Iran's cooperation with 
Russia by providing military aid. If evidence is presented that 
the Central Bank of Iran facilitated any of these transactions, 
should the U.S. sanction Iran's Central Bank?

                       FROM DALEEP SINGH

Q.1. Sanctions and Human Rights in Iran--In your testimony, you 
mention how sanctions have been successful in holding Russia 
accountable for its unjust invasion of Ukraine. However, the 
United States has also used sanctions as a tool against 
violators of human rights such as Iran following its brutal 
crackdown on protests sparked by the killing of Mahsa Amini.
    To what extent are targeted sanctions against authoritarian 
regimes an effective tool for promoting democracy and human 
rights?

               RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF
              SENATOR FETTERMAN FROM DALEEP SINGH

Q.1.As displayed by the United States in response to Russia's 
invasion of Ukraine, economic sanctions are a critical tool in 
advancing foreign policy and national security objectives. 
Other economic tools such as export controls and inbound 
investment screening play a critical role as well. In your 
'Written testimony, you highlighted the need for the United 
States to balance its increased use of sanctions and related 
measures, which are designed to cause economic pain, with an 
even greater increase in measures that offer mutual economic 
gain. For countries of concern, Congress and the Administration 
are considering screening and restrictions on outbound 
investments that support those countries' development of 
critical capabilities that have national and economic security 
implications. Without these measures, the United States risks 
allowing countries like the People's Republic of China to 
accelerate their access to our critical capabilities and 
technology. Furthermore, we risk surrendering even more 
manufacturing strength and jobs to the detriment of American 
workers, manufacturers, and innovators.
    How will an outbound investment screening mechanism help 
the United States protect our national security and supply 
chains?

       RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR KENNEDY
                       FROM DALEEP SINGH

Q.1. Chinese Military Companies Sanctions--Mr. Singh, as 
someone who served in this Administration, do you have an 
explanation for why your colleagues have failed to expand the 
Treasury Department's Chinese military companies sanctions list 
in over 14 months?

A.1. Response not received in time for publication.

Q.2. Expanding the Restrictions--Should dangerous Chinese 
military companies be able to freely access and exploit the 
United States?

A.2. Response not received in time for publication.

Q.3. Then shouldn't we consider more stringent sanctions 
against these companies beyond a narrow investment ban?

A.3. Response not received in time for publication.

Q.4. Export Controls--Export controls have been a key U.S. 
foreign policy and national security tool, and the Biden 
administration has been using this policy lever. BIS leaders 
have said, ``Russia and China will continue to be at the 
forefront of BIS policy actions, frankly for years to come.'' 
Earlier last year, the focus included working with a robust 
group of U.S. allies and partners to implement controls on 
Russia due to their unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. In October 
2022, significant controls were placed on advanced 
semiconductors, machinery and computers, largely with regard to 
China. There have been reports that the Administration is close 
to securing multilateral cooperation on the Oct. 7 
semiconductor controls with Japan and the Netherlands.
    Could you address the importance of working with our allies 
on export controls?
    How successful has the multilateral coordination been with 
regard to Russia, in your opinions, and do you think this 
coordination can happen with regard to China--as well?
    What are the consequences our international partners do not 
agree to cooperate on export controls?

A.4. Response not received in time for publication.

Q.5. There has been a lot of discussion, both in Congress and 
in the Administration, regarding the creation of an outbound 
investment screening regime to ensure that U.S. investments are 
not enabling Chinese military technological advantages that may 
harm U.S. national security.
    The United States already has a robust export controls 
regime that makes sure sensitive technology and know-how does 
not end up in adversaries' hands.
    Can you address any gaps there might be in U.S. export 
controls that an investment screening regime might fill?
    Can you speak to any unintended consequences that may arise 
if this Executive order or potential legislation is too broad 
in scope?
    Is it important that this effort is also coordinated with 
U.S. allies and partners?

                        FROM CLAY LOWERY

Q.1. Does Europe need to break up with Russia on all forms of 
energy, including nuclear? Could the United States replace much 
of the demand by expanding U.S.-produced energy, including oil, 
liquified natural gas, and nuclear power? Is there anything 
that needs to be done on our trade export finance side to 
accomplish this?

A.1. Speaking on my own behalf--and not for my employer or its 
members--the faster that Europe becomes less dependent on all 
Russian energy--the better off it will be. Europe has taken 
some important steps over the past year to wean itself off 
Russian energy supplies, including an oil embargo and the 
building of infrastructure to receive liquified natural gas 
(LNG) from outside of Russian exports. The United States is 
clearly one of the countries that can produce LNG and export it 
to Europe. This, I think, is a win for Europe and for the 
United States.
    If the U.S. Government can help facilitate such overseas 
sales--via regulatory issues, trade facilitation, or even 
financing--then this should be pursued.

Q.1. Chinese Money Laundering for Fentanyl in Mexico--What is 
the role of Chinese money launderers in underwriting the 
fentanyl drug trade?

A.1. I have no knowledge of this issue, I'm afraid.

Q.2. What techniques are employed by these launderers, and what 
platforms are they utilizing?

A.2. I have no knowledge of this issue, I'm afraid.

Q.3. What is needed for Federal law enforcement to back-trace 
these transactions to operators in China and identify them?

A.3. This is outside of my expertise.

Q.4. What is the role of the Chinese Communist Party in 
enabling this transnational money laundering?

A.4. I have no knowledge of this issue, I'm afraid.

Q.5. Cooperation with China--In August 2022, China announced 
that they are suspending bilateral cooperation with the United 
States in a variety of areas, including counternarcotic 
operations.
    Has China's decision to suspend bilateral cooperation in 
counternarcotic operations significantly impacted our ability 
to counter fentanyl trade? Is current reporting on China's role 
accurate without this relationship?

A.5. I have no knowledge of this issue, I'm afraid.
                                ------

Q.1. Multilateral Coordination on Economic Statecraft--As you 
mentioned in your testimony, multilateral coordination with 
U.S. allies is crucial to ensuring that sanctions and other 
tools of economic statecraft are effective. Sanctions from the 
European Union, Japan, and Korea have been helpful in 
decreasing Russian oil exports, however, increases in purchases 
of Russian oil by India and Turkey has undermined the economic 
impact of these efforts.
    What more can the United States do to incentivize our 
allies and partners to join our economic efforts to hold our 
adversaries accountable for their actions?

A.1. Speaking on my own behalf--and not for my employer or its 
members--I think this is a very good and very difficult 
question. The primary approach I believe is continued diplomacy 
and ``carrots'' that make sense for the countries in question. 
There are sticks that may be unrelated to the sanctions regime 
that I'm not as familiar with that could potentially be used; 
however, the one stick that I know is advocated by some--
including people I have deep respect for--is a secondary 
sanctions regime. This approach can have an impact, but it 
could undermine the ability of holding a coalition together, 
which suggests much caution before taking such an approach, 
particularly at a time where we are seeing greater signs that 
the energy embargo that the EU put in place over the winter on 
Russia is starting to have an impact.

                        FROM CLAY LOWERY

Q.1. Expanding the Restrictions--Should dangerous Chinese 
military companies be able to freely access and exploit the 
United States?

A.1. No.

Q.2. Then shouldn't we consider more stringent sanctions 
against these companies beyond a narrow investment ban?

A.2. Speaking on my own behalf--and not for my employer or its 
members--I'd say the answer is ``potentially.'' I choose that 
word because when addressing specific companies, I believe 
basing it on an evidence-based regime remains core to our own 
values and, frankly, ``getting it right.''

Q.3. Investment Policy--There has been a lot of discussion, 
both in Congress and in the administration, regarding the 
creation of an outbound investment screening regime to ensure 
that U.S. investments are not enabling Chinese military 
technological advantages that may harm U.S. national security. 
The United States already has a robust export controls regime 
that makes sure sensitive technology and know-how does not end 
up in adversaries' hands.
    Can you address any gaps there might be in U.S. export 
controls that an investment screening regime might fill?

A.3. Speaking on my own behalf--and not for my employer or its 
members--I think this is an excellent question and one of the 
key points I tried to make in my testimony, which is that if 
Congress and the Executive branch consider creating an outbound 
investment screening mechanism, they should avoid duplication 
of existing authorities, such as export controls. If there are 
current gaps in our existing export control regime, then by all 
means--let's try to close them either with executive reforms 
or, if necessary, by legislative means. An outward-bound 
investment regime should be narrowly tailored to avoid becoming 
a supra export control regime.

Q.4. Can you speak to any unintended consequences that may 
arise if this Executive order or potential legislation is too 
broad in scope?

A.4. Speaking on my own behalf--and not for my employer or its 
members--I believe that an overly broad outward-bound 
investment regime could be difficult to implement, threaten 
U.S. competitiveness, undermine the ability to develop allies/
partners, and could harm U.S. investors more than the actual 
target of the regime--thus being counterproductive to U.S. 
interests.

Q.5. Is it important that this effort is also coordinated with 
U.S. allies and partners?

A.5. Speaking on my own behalf--and not for my employer or its 
members--there is little question that if we don't find a way 
to coordinate with allies and partners, then an outward-bound 
investment regime will be akin to a unilateral export control: 
we could essentially cut the U.S. companies and individuals 
from markets while having little impact--if any--on the 
national security threat that we are trying to address.
                                ------

Q.1. Do you believe our export controls regime is currently 
equipped to address attempts by foreign Governments, like 
Russia and China, to misappropriate American goods and 
technologies while also ensuring we're promoting the interests 
of American citizens and businesses?

A.1. Response not received in time for publication.

Q.2. Although Russia's economy is still functioning as Mr. 
Lowery described during the hearing, it appears that our 
sanctions and export controls have successfully limited 
Russia's ability to resupply military equipment damaged or 
destroyed in the war. Do you believe that export controls are 
effective or targeted enough to prevent the development of more 
advanced systems from Russia and China? If not, should we be 
doing more with our export control regime?

A.2. Response not received in time for publication.

Q.1. Export Controls and Human Rights--Export controls through 
multilateral coordination between the United States and its 
allies can be an effective tool for promoting national and 
economic security. However, it is important that these tools 
are used in a fashion that does not encourage human rights 
violations.
    How can we strike a balance between utilizing export 
controls and sanctions against authoritarian regimes while also 
promoting human rights for everyday citizens in these 
countries?

Q.3. Export Controls--Export controls have been a key U.S. 
foreign policy and national security tool, and the Biden 
administration has been using this policy lever. BIS leaders 
have said, ``Russia and China will continue to be at the 
forefront of BIS policy actions, frankly for years to come.'' 
Earlier last year, the focus included working with a robust 
group of U.S. allies and partners to implement controls on 
Russia due to their unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. In October 
2022, significant controls were placed on advanced 
semiconductors, machinery and computers, largely with regard to 
China. There have been reports that the administration is close 
to securing multilateral cooperation on the Oct. 7 
semiconductor controls with Japan and the Netherlands.
    Could you address the importance of working with our allies 
on export controls?
    How successful has the multilateral coordination been with 
regard to Russia, in your opinions, and do you think this 
coordination can happen with regard to China as well?
    What are the consequences our international partners do not 
agree to cooperate on export controls?
