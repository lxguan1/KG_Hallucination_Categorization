                    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY


             opening statement of senator chris van hollen


    Senator Van Hollen. Welcome, everybody. This hearing will 
come to order. And I want to start by welcoming Senator Hagerty 
as the Ranking Member of the Financial Services and General 
Government (FSGG) Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.
    Also pleased to continue to have Senator Kennedy on the 
subcommittee, and newly having Senator Heinrich on the 
subcommittee. And Madam Secretary, thank you for your service. 
Thank you for being here today to talk about the 2024 Treasury 
budget and related matters.
    Since its very inception, the Department of Treasury has 
played a central role in maintaining a strong economy, spurring 
growth and promoting opportunity. Secretary Yellen, I suspect 
that much of your attention in recent days has been focused on 
the situation with the banking system.
    I give you and the Biden Administration, the FDIC, and 
others, high marks for the way you responded quickly and 
decisively to the Silicon Valley Bank default and the issues 
with Signature Bank as well as others. First of all, making it 
crystal clear that the United States Government is not going to 
bail out the owners and investors of the bank, but also 
assuring depositors that they would be held harmless.
    That was a very important measure to take to make sure that 
the workers at small businesses and other companies that bank 
with Silicon Valley Bank got paid and also to prevent the 
contagion within the system.
    I also want to commend you and your team on the efforts you 
made in implementing the sanctions on Russia, including efforts 
to place a price cap on Russian oil and Russian petroleum 
products. We have worked with the Deputy Secretary as well as 
you on these issues. I do believe we could go even further in 
terms of ratcheting down the price cap in that area.
    I also want to applaud your efforts to move toward a global 
minimum tax rate for corporations to stop the current race to 
the bottom that we have seen between countries. A little later, 
I am going to ask you about the debt ceiling. The United States 
of America pays its bills on time.
    We always have. And because of that, the United States has 
earned a reputation as a reliable, credible, and trustworthy 
partner here and around the world. And that reputation helps 
every single American and our entire economy. We need, speaking 
of the deficit, to make sure that the IRS has the capacity and 
the resources needed to collect revenues that are due and 
owing, including from very wealthy tax cheats.
    Now, that is why the IRS received $80 billion over 10 years 
in the Inflation Reduction Act, and we will be asking you some 
questions about implementation and use of those resources. 
Obviously, they also go toward trying to improve, dramatically 
improve IRS customer service, which we are already seen results 
from, as well as dealing with outdated technology, including 
the COBOL system, which the IRS continues to use.
    We know that there are over somewhere between $500 billion 
and $1 trillion in taxes each year that are owed and not paid. 
Those are just some of the issues under the purview of the 
Department of Treasury.
    Madam Secretary, again, I would like to commend you and 
your staff on being responsive to questions from Members of the 
Committee. And let me now turn it over to Senator Hagerty for 
his opening statement.


               opening statement of senator bill hagerty


    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Chairman, Van Hollen, and thank 
you for holding this hearing today. As the new Ranking Member 
of the Committee, I look forward to working alongside you and 
all of our colleagues.
    We have an exceptional job ahead of us. We are challenged 
in conducting rigorous oversight to strengthen U.S. financial 
systems and ensure that the dollars that taxpayers have 
entrusted to us with are spent responsibly. I also want to 
welcome our witness today, Secretary Yellen.
    Thank you for appearing before the subcommittee, Secretary, 
at such a critical time for our economy, and I look forward to 
your testimony. Secretary Yellen, the Department of Treasury 
has a fundamental role in managing our Nation's debt and 
collecting its taxes. The President, with the advice and 
consent of the Senate, has conferred upon you a great 
responsibility and obligation to provide sound economic 
guidance.
    At this same time, it is your duty to respect the rights of 
taxpayers who rely on you to treat them fairly. Unfortunately, 
our Nation has accumulated an unprecedented amount of debt at 
levels that are unsustainable at this point.
    One of our Nation's greatest strengths is the depth and 
liquidity of our financial markets that has allowed us to 
capitalize our economy with large amounts of money at a 
relatively low cost, a significant competitive advantage for 
our Nation.
    Further, our historic commitment to the rule of law and our 
commitment to repay our debts underpins this strength. While I 
understand the desire to raise the debt limit, repaying our 
debts is not just a matter of periodically increasing the 
amount we can borrow.
    We are on an unsustainable path for which the bill will 
ultimately come due. Our ability to repay our debts requires us 
to live within our means, which means we must put our economy 
on track to eliminate the annual deficit.
    In my view, we either take serious steps toward addressing 
our fiscal house now, or we allow the global financial markets, 
who will not ignore our fiscal peril, to make those decisions 
for us, and it won't be pretty. The country is looking for 
leadership from you, Madam Secretary, to navigate this 
difficult fiscal path.
    However, I was disappointed to see the President's budget 
put forward a series of tax increases that have been largely 
rejected by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. The tax 
increases proposed in the President's budget would make 
American businesses less competitive and ultimately weaken our 
economy at a time when we desperately need it to be strong.
    Combating inflation remains a priority for me. Many basic 
goods and services are too expensive for most American 
families. Again, I believe that too much spending has placed 
upward pressure on prices. Very simply, there are too many 
dollars chasing too few goods and services. My constituents' 
purchasing power has steadily and dramatically eroded over the 
course of this Administration.
    One way we can both rein in inflation and expand the 
economy is by extending tax reform, which contrary to forecast 
at the time, resulted in booming corporate tax receipts for the 
Federal Government, allowing manufacturers to deduct the full 
cost of their capital expenditures in the year that they are 
made, encourages businesses to build more factories, help 
workers to become more productive, raise wages, and it expands 
economic output.
    When we expand supply, we put downward pressure on the 
system to meet demand. In that manner, businesses provide more 
goods and services to their customers at a lower price. The 
problem with more government spending is it just redistributes 
private resources from one group to another, generating 
economic friction and inefficiency.
    Its primary effect is to increase demand, not to increase 
supply, further adding to inflationary pressures. Rather than 
helping individuals and businesses during these challenging 
times, taxpayers are facing greater tax burdens, reduced 
customer service from the IRS, and endless amounts of paperwork 
and bookkeeping requirements.
    I have reintroduced my Snoop Act, which would strike the 
Biden Administration's requirement that third party platforms 
report businesses gross transaction volumes totaling more than 
$600 per year to the IRS. This requirement is cumbersome, is 
difficult to comply with, and it needlessly intrudes into 
Americans' privacy.
    While I was glad to see your department is temporarily 
delaying the implementation of this provision, I will continue 
to stand up for small business owners with an aim to put an end 
to this egregious and unwanted overreach.
    And finally, as a lifelong businessman, I have been 
following the developments over the past week as we have seen 
unfold a pair of spectacular bank failures. To me, this entire 
situation was a series of failures that should have been 
foreseen. First, it is a massive failure on the part of 
management.
    Silicon Valley Bank's board and management seem to have 
been asleep at the wheel. It has become--beyond comprehension 
that they could have allowed the Chief Risk Officer position to 
remain vacant for 8 months during the period leading up to this 
collapse. It is malpractice, plain and simple.
    Second, it was a massive failure of oversight from the San 
Francisco Federal Reserve Bank who in their position--who in 
their possession had the detailed liquidity reports that should 
have made it clear that this was a real issue. But perhaps the 
biggest failure of all is how this Administration mishandled 
the crisis, particularly the decision to take Silicon Valley 
Bank and Signature Bank into receivership instead of 
expeditiously expediting an auction.
    By failing the auction process, we find ourselves now in a 
completely new environment where no one knows the limits of the 
taxpayer backstop. The decision made by the FDIC, the Federal 
Reserve Board, and by yourself to guarantee all deposits of 
both banks, even though those exceeding--even those exceeding 
the $250,000 insured limit sets a dangerous and uncertain 
precedent, one that would not have been necessary had a 
successful auction occurred.
    And it sets up American taxpayers to foot the bill, 
regardless of the Administration's claims to the contrary. As 
we saw on Sunday with the FDIC's announcement of the sale of a 
significant portion of Signature Bank's assets, losses are 
already being accumulated and those losses will be forced upon 
the entire banking system, and by extension, U.S. taxpayers.
    Secretary Yellen, I hope you can address these concerns 
today in both your testimony and during the period of 
questions. Thank you.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator Hagerty. The 
Appropriations Committee has two new strong leaders. We have a 
new Chair, Senator Murray, and a new Ranking Member, Senator 
Susan Collins, who is with us today. Senator Collins, Ranking 
Member Collins, do you have any opening comments?
    Senator Collins. I do not--thanks----
    Senator Van Hollen. Okay. Thank you. Madam Secretary, it is 
great to be with you. Your biography and experience is well 
known to Members of the Committee, so I won't go on for a long 
time.
    I will note that you are the first person to have led the 
White House Council of Economic Advisors, the Federal Reserve, 
and the Treasury Department. It is also great to see your 
signature on our currency.
    So, without objection, Madam Secretary, your full written 
testimony will be entered into the record. I ask you to please 
summarize your opening statement in approximately 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF HON. JANET YELLEN, SECRETARY, U.S. 
            DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY
    Secretary Yellen. Chairman Van Hollen and Ranking Member 
Hagerty, thank you for inviting me to join you today. I would 
also like to thank you for your leadership of this subcommittee 
in support of the Treasury Department.
    Two years into this Administration, Treasury continues to 
serve at the forefront of our Nation's response to some of its 
most urgent challenges. We have advanced our country's domestic 
and international economic priorities thanks to the resources 
that you have provided us. Our top priority is to protect the 
health of the U.S. economy.
    Two weeks ago, we learned of problems at two banks that 
could have had significant impacts on the broader banking 
system and the American economy. In the days that followed, 
Treasury worked with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to take 
decisive, and forceful actions to strengthen public confidence 
in the U.S. banking system.
    We took actions to protect all depositors of the two failed 
institutions and provide additional liquidity for banks. This 
was designed to mitigate risks to the banking system. It is 
important to be clear, shareholders and debt holders of the 
failed banks are not being protected by the government, and no 
losses from the resolution of these banks are being borne by 
the taxpayer.
    Deposit protection is provided by the Deposit Insurance 
Fund, which is funded by fees from insured banks. As I said 
last week, the U.S. banking system is sound. The Federal 
Government's recent actions have demonstrated our resolute 
commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that 
depositors savings remain safe.
    Beyond our work on the financial system, Treasury has also 
led our Administration's broader efforts to recover and 
stabilize our economy from a once in a century pandemic shock. 
Our Office of Recovery Programs help drive the fastest and most 
inclusive labor market recovery in history by coordinating the 
effective implementation of the American Rescue Plan relief.
    Today, the unemployment rate is near historic lows. Our 
economy has added over 12 million jobs since 2021. Our 
Administration is now building on that progress by effectively 
implementing long term investments enacted by Congress. 
Internationally, Treasury continues to mount a swift, bold, and 
enduring response to Russia's illegal war against Ukraine. In 
my visit to Kyiv a month ago, Ukrainian officials told me 
firsthand about the critical impact of our work.
    As part of a broad coalition, we are responsibly disbursing 
vital economic assistance to Ukraine. Since last February, 
Treasury has also implemented over 2,500 Russia related 
sanctions. We have degraded the Kremlin's ability to replace 
more than 9,000 pieces of heavy military equipment that it has 
lost on the battlefield.
    We have also stabilized global energy markets and cut into 
the Kremlin's revenues by implementing innovative caps on the 
price of Russian oil. The President's fiscal year 2024 budget 
requests the necessary resources to continue advancing our 
Nation's priorities. I will highlight three imperatives. First, 
the budget requests $14 billion in discretionary resources for 
the IRS.
    For too long, the IRS has been woefully underfunded. We are 
changing that. Our budget request provides steady State 
operational funding that will allow taxpayers to receive the 
best service possible. It will complement the one-time long-
term investment in the IRS from the Inflation Reduction Act.
    We have already seen our investments pay off. For example, 
the IRS has answered a million more phone calls during this 
filing season than at this time last year, and now is the time 
to build on this progress. Second, our budget request shores up 
our capacity to respond to Russia's immoral war in advance of 
our national security priorities.
    It includes $244 million for the Office of Terrorism and 
Financial Intelligence to continue to administer, enforce, and 
modernize our sanctions regime. It also allows the office to 
expand financial intelligence in sanctions related economic 
analysis. Further, the budget request $229 million for FinCEN 
to support its efforts to address deficiencies that illicit 
actors exploit to evade scrutiny.
    Third, this request enables us to continue our work to 
bolster the long-term foundations of the American economy. We 
are requesting $332 million for Treasury's Departmental 
Offices, which craft and implement policies to advance our 
economic priorities and coordinate Government wide efforts to 
promote financial stability and growth.
    We are also asking for an increase for the Community 
Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, which expands 
credit and financial support to historically underserved 
communities.
    I want to end by thanking the men and women of the Treasury 
Department for their service. Their dedication and commitment 
inspire me every day, and I could not be prouder to call them 
my colleagues. With that, I am happy to take your questions.

    [The statement follows:]
               Prepared Statement of Hon. Janet L. Yellen
    Chairman Van Hollen and Ranking Member Hagerty: thank you for

Department for their service. Their dedication and commitment inspire 
me every day, and I could not be prouder to call them my colleagues.
    With that, I'm happy to take your questions.

    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Madam Secretary. I think 
your testimony underscored the depth and breadth of the 
responsibilities of the Department of Treasury. Thank you for 
listing those priorities, including, importantly, CDFIs.
    Going back to the banking situation, I saw you gave some 
remarks just the other day indicating that we are still 
determining the root causes of the recent crisis. And I also 
serve on the Banking and Housing Committee, and we are going to 
be having hearings next week to try to get to the bottom of 
exactly what happened in Silicon Valley Bank and other banks.
    But there is one area where I think we can agree, I hope we 
can agree to move forward now on the issue of accountability, 
and that is the need for legislation to empower Federal 
regulators like the FDIC to claw back compensation packages and 
stock profits that were gained by executives at failing banks 
in close proximity to the bank's failure.
    I know that under the Dodd-Frank Law, that authority exists 
for executives of the biggest banks, but apparently it does not 
exist with respect to banks the size of Silicon Valley Bank. 
And we also know from reports that the CEO of Silicon Valley 
Bank sold about $3 million worth of shares just a short time 
before the collapse.
    I know President Biden has called upon Congress to change 
the law so that we can hold executives accountable. This is 
whether or not there is criminal wrongdoing or not. That is a 
separate matter.
    I know the Justice Department, the FBI will be looking into 
that. But just as a basis of accountability, would you, Madam 
Secretary, you and the Treasury Department, work with me and 
others in the Senate who are interested in fashioning 
legislation along the lines that President Biden also supports?
    Secretary Yellen. Certainly, Senator Van Hollen, we, of 
course, agree with President Biden that those who were 
responsible for the failure of a bank should not be profiting 
when stockholders and investors in the bank are taking--forced 
to take losses. And when the Deposit Insurance Fund is working 
to save the depositors in stem runs, that this is an important 
form of accountability. And we would be glad to work with you 
on that legislation.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. I look forward to doing that 
and hopefully we can get it passed on a bipartisan basis and 
support accountability in the system. I think American 
consumers are sort of looking at the situation here where those 
who were clearly responsible for the failure in their banks are 
running away with major profits.
    And that doesn't seem right, especially at a time, as you 
said, when we are asking, we are going to be asking other banks 
to help support those depositors.
    I am somewhat concerned that perceptions and a sense that 
there is riskiness in the bank system because of these failures 
will lead some people potentially to go to the shadow banking 
system, which, as you know, is a much more risky proposition 
and not subject to much of the regulation that currently 
exists, including the kind of capital requirements that apply 
in the banking system.
    As Secretary of the Treasury, you serve as the chair of the 
Financial Stability Oversight Board, which has the authority to 
designate non-banks as systemically important financial 
institutions.
    Last November, in the Banking Committee, I asked the 
Federal bank regulators that were before us as witnesses, 
including the vice chair of the Federal Reserve Bar and the 
heads of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) 
and the FDIC, if they would support a repeal of the Trump era 
guidance that made it much more difficult to regulate the much 
riskier shadow banking sector.
    The answer from all three of those witnesses who are 
responsible for it and who sit on the board with you was yes, 
they would vote to repeal that limitation on the ability to 
provide prudent regulation over the non-banking sector.
    So, my question to you, Madam Secretary, is can we move 
forward and hold that vote on the Financial Stability Oversight 
Council (FSOC)? And if so, when.
    Secretary Yellen. I am working very closely with FSOC. We 
are considering and drafting revised guidance on designation 
that would restore FSOC's lost capacity to designate non-bank 
financial institutions as systemic and subject them to 
regulation.
    I would say that more generally the risks that you 
mentioned in the non-bank financial sector, sometimes other 
forms of intervention can be appropriate and I have made it a 
priority since I became Treasury Secretary, as Chair of FSOC, 
to look at a number of different risks in the non-bank 
financial sector. In some cases, for example, the case of money 
market mutual funds or open-end bond funds, where I believe 
there are risks, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
has the authority, and FSOC has worked with the SEC.
    The SEC is in the process of taking appropriate action. So 
FSOC has a number of different tools to deal with these risks, 
but I agree with you that risks have migrated to that sector 
and designation is an important power that needs to be in the 
toolkit of FSOC.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, thank you, Madam Secretary. Look 
forward to working with you and I hope you will schedule that 
as soon as possible. My last question for this round relates to 
the debt ceiling.
    My head was spinning this morning when I saw the speaker of 
the House say that the recent banking crisis made it even more 
important that we threaten the debt ceiling in order to achieve 
major budget cuts, the kind of cuts that have been outlined in 
the House, by House Republicans.
    You are very aware, I think, of what the risks would be if 
the United States does not meet its full faith and credit. Do 
you believe that the recent uncertainty in the banking system 
means that we should threaten the full faith and credit of the 
United States in order to pass budgets that one of us on one 
side of the Capitol or the other may like?
    Secretary Yellen. The failure to raise the debt ceiling 
would cause an economic and financial catastrophe.
    It would be a failure of the U.S. Government for the first 
time since 1789 to fail to pay bills that it had incurred, and 
it would cause a loss of confidence in the United States as the 
safest country, that our currency as a reserve currency used by 
the world--it would bring untold, unbelievable economic damage.
    I think this is something that just can't be contemplated. 
It is a fundamental, basic responsibility of Congress to pay 
the Government's bills. And I call on Congress to expeditiously 
raise the debt ceiling.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, thank you, Madam Secretary. 
Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Chairman Van Hollen. Before I 
get into my line of questioning, I just want to clarify on the 
debt ceiling piece. Secretary Yellen, do you think it is not 
possible to negotiate in any respect the spending package that 
has been put forward? Is it possible to set aside and agree 
that our Nation's debts will be paid, that we will pay the 
interest on our debt, and set that component aside and agree to 
that before we get to any discussion on specific spending 
reductions?
    Secretary Yellen. I am not sure exactly what you are 
suggesting here. President Biden has indicated that he is more 
than willing to discuss an appropriate path for spending in 
taxes in the overall deficit, that it is important to have a 
fiscally responsible budget plan, and that these are certainly 
appropriate matters for discussion between the White House and 
Democrats and Republicans in the Congress, and he looks forward 
to doing that, but not under the specter of destroying the 
country's economic and financial----
    Senator Hagerty. I think the specter of this being 
presented is a false choice. And the specter that you present 
does not have to be that. We are facing an unprecedented 
spending epidemic. We are in a deficit spending situation.
    We have $31 trillion of debt moving higher that we are 
parking on the backs of the shoulders of our children. If we 
don't address it in a responsible manner ourselves, the capital 
markets will address it eventually, and I think that will be 
far more catastrophic. So, we have to find a way to talk about 
this that doesn't pit ourselves of this doom and gloom scenario 
and that we find a way to actually address that.
    Secretary Yellen. Senator Hagerty, President Biden has 
submitted to Congress a budget that has, over the next decade, 
$3 trillion of deficit reduction. It invests in our workforce, 
in our economy----
    Senator Hagerty. And massively increases taxes at a time 
when we are trying to recover our economy. It is a nonstarter 
on both sides of the aisle, as you know, Madam Secretary. Let 
me get back to the questions that I wanted to entertain with 
you, though, today.
    As I mentioned in my opening statement, I have been 
tracking the Silicon Valley and Signature Bank situation in 
very close detail. The situation was caused by a remarkable set 
of failures, in particular the Silicon Valley Bank situation, 
failures of management, failures of Federal oversight, and 
failures of how we responded to it.
    Both President Biden and in your opening remarks just a few 
minutes ago, you unequivocally stated that no losses will be 
borne by the taxpayer for the actions that have been taken by 
the Fed, the Treasury, and the FDIC in guaranteeing that all 
insured deposits at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank that 
followed the failed auction of SVB, that none of those will be 
borne by the taxpayer.
    I understand why that claim is politically appealing, but 
it is impossible to square with how these programs actually 
work. As you know, the systemic designation used in the 
guarantee of SVB and Signature Banks' deposits relies on the 
FDIC, Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, which will be replenished 
in the case of a loss with a special assessment on banks across 
the Nation, which inevitably will be passed along to all bank 
customers, which, last time I checked, were American taxpayers.
    So, as we saw with Signature Bank, the estimated cost to 
the Deposit Insurance Fund for this resolution alone is $2.5 
billion, which will be paid for by fees assessed to banks 
across the Nation. Is that correct?
    Secretary Yellen. There will be a special assessment to--so 
it is only an estimate, the $2.5 billion. We don't really know 
what the final cost----
    Senator Hagerty. I understand.
    Secretary Yellen [continuing]. Will be but there will be a 
special assessment----
    Senator Hagerty [continuing]. If you add SVB, it is going 
to become much, much larger. And when you increase the cost of 
doing business, that cost is going to get passed on to 
customers. So, this number, $2.5 billion plus and any future 
losses will be in fact borne by bank customers across the 
United States. Again, American taxpayers, the last time I 
checked, is that correct?
    Secretary Yellen. But they may be borne by shareholders of 
the firms.
    Senator Hagerty. I think the fees tend to be passed on to 
the consumers. I would like to turn to news reports yesterday. 
The Treasury is considering whether the Administration can 
order an unprecedented expansion of FDIC coverage to guarantee 
all in insured deposits.
    As was reported, this facility would be backed by the 
Exchange Stabilization Fund, which was created to support the 
value of the U.S. dollar in international markets, not as a 
slush fund when consulting Congress may be inconvenient.
    I am deeply concerned by these reports, that such a program 
would not only constitute a misuse of the ESF, but it would 
circumvent Congress's role in approving such an action. So, 
Madam Secretary, does insuring every deposit, every FDIC 
insured bank in the Nation over $250,000 require Congressional 
approval?
    Secretary Yellen. This is not something that we have looked 
at. It is not something that we are considering. All that I 
have said is that when the failure of a bank is judged by 
supermajorities of the FDIC board, the Fed board, and myself in 
consultation with the President, when such a failure is deemed 
to create systemic risk, which I think of as the risk of a 
contagious bank run, then we are likely to invoke this systemic 
risk exception which permits the FDIC to protect all 
depositors, and that that would be a case by case 
determination----
    Senator Hagerty. I understand, and that----
    Secretary Yellen. We have not considered or discussed 
anything having to do with blanket insurance or guarantees of 
deposits.
    Senator Hagerty. Two points, Madam Secretary. One, I would 
encourage you, if you do consider something broader than the 
basic $250,000, that you remind--to remind you that 
Congressional approval is required in the form of a joint 
resolution.
    Two, the program that you just stated really suggests to 
many people in America, certainly people in my home State, that 
there is a two-tier system of insurance here in America. For 
those that are deemed to be systemically important at the time 
and those that are not. I think many Tennessee banks are 
concerned that they would not be deemed----
    Secretary Yellen. I would disagree with that, Senator 
Hagerty. And I said explicitly in remarks I gave yesterday to 
the American Bankers Association, which is mainly consists of 
community banks, that this is not a question of invoking it for 
large or medium sized banks only. That the failure of a small 
bank, of a community bank could likewise trigger a run-on other 
banks and lead to the same judgment that the failure of that 
community bank creates systemic----
    Senator Hagerty. I think more clarity here would be 
appreciated. Thank you. And I want to turn to one more point 
that you and I have discussed in a number of times before in a 
very short period of time that I have. This has to do with the 
ProPublica leak of taxpayer information.
    We have met now, this is the fourth time you and I met 
about this. The fact is that ProPublica was a leaker, or 
somebody at the IRS, or somehow, they have--ProPublica has 
leaked confidential taxpayer information. It has been nearly 2 
years since this occurred. Has anyone been held to account?
    Secretary Yellen. I am just as frustrated by the situation 
as you are. I would love to know who is responsible for that. 
And I am afraid that I know no more about this than I did when 
the leak first occurred.
    We did what I believe is the appropriate thing, which is to 
refer this matter to independent investigators, the Treasury 
Inspector General, the IRS Inspector General, and the 
Department of Justice. And there are a lot of----
    Senator Hagerty. And no new reports?
    Secretary Yellen [continuing]. Independent investigations 
that follow their own timelines, and I can't tell you when they 
are going to be concluded. I would suggest that you ask those 
investigators when they think it might be concluded.
    I would really like to get a report, and I think this was a 
very serious matter and deserves an independent and thorough 
investigation.
    Senator Hagerty. It damages the confidence of taxpayers in 
America.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Madam Secretary. As I said 
at the outset, the Appropriations Committee has a new Chair, 
and I am pleased that she is joining us today. Senator Murray.
    Senator Murray. Well, thank you very much, Chair Van Hollen 
and Ranking Member Hagerty. As Vice Chair Collins, who is also 
here with us today, and I made clear when we announced our plan 
to return this Committee to regular order, we have a 
responsibility to deliver for the American people by working 
together to draft and pass funding bills that strengthen our 
economy and keep America competitive on the world stage, and 
make sure that our families here at home are financially secure 
and thriving.
    This is no small feat, as we all know. But this hearing is 
really an important reminder that when it comes to keeping our 
Nation strong, secure, and competitive, it is not just about 
how much we spend on defense, which is important.
    It is also important how strong our economy is, and I mean, 
on Main Street, not just on Wall Street. And as we have seen, 
the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank have 
been a really stark reminder of the important role Treasury 
does play regulating our banks, ensuring our economy is sound, 
and protecting American workers and savers from paying the 
price for Wall Street's mistakes.
    And that is really critical because working families are 
the backbone of this economy. And that means when our families 
are less financially secure, our Nation is less financially 
secure. Strong funding for Treasury means strong enforcement of 
our sanctions against Russia and Iran, the drug cartels, and 
other dangerous actors. It also means when my constituents call 
the IRS with a question about their taxes, they can actually 
get a real person on the other end of the line.
    And thanks to the funding the Democrats passed, the IRS is 
now answering 90 percent of its phone calls. That is a dramatic 
improvement from the 13 percent last year. But we still are 
playing catch up on these investments. The technology that 
handles Americans' tax returns, for example, is over 60 years 
old.
    So, we need a modern IRS. And that won't just mean fewer 
tax cheats, stifling families when it comes to paying their 
fair share. It means that Americans' personal financial 
information is safer from cyber-attacks or nefarious actors.
    And it will mean we could put more money back in families' 
pockets when it comes to the tax refunds and relief that they 
are entitled to, like the childcare tax credit President Biden 
proposes reinstating in this budget. Secretary Yellen, I asked 
you about the IRS spend plan for the IRA funding in our call 
when we talked last month.
    Congress still doesn't have that. And I want to join Chair 
Van Hollen in saying the department has had enough time to 
produce it and we expect to see it. And lastly, families, of 
course, are also counting on us to raise the debt limit, you 
just talked about this, without drama, without delay.
    And let me just be clear, as you were, that the full faith 
and credit of the United States, that is to pay our bills on 
time like every families expected to, is not something that 
should ever be held hostage to score cheap political points at 
the expense of working people in this country.
    Not getting that done would be catastrophic for our 
economy, so I hope we can do this in a straightforward, 
bipartisan way, as we have many times under both Republican and 
Democratic leadership.
    So, again, thank you for being here today and I just want 
to say I am going to be very closely paying attention to the 
work on the issues raised by the Silicon Valley Bank and 
Signature Bank, and I expect that you will keep us updated on 
this as we move along.
    Secretary Yellen. Yes, of course. I would be glad to.
    Senator Murray. Thank you. In terms of questions, last 
year, I was able to pass a sweeping bipartisan retirement bill, 
in our SECURE 2.0 Act, that will increase families' financial 
resiliency and help more families save for a dignified 
retirement and make it easier for businesses to offer 
retirement plans. Can you tell us what resources Treasury will 
need to implement all of the SECURE directives in a timely 
manner?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes, there are some resources the 
Treasury will need, and they are included in the 2024 budget. 
My understanding is that the Bureau of Fiscal Services will 
need about $10 million to complete their effort to digitize 
savings bonds.
    The Office of Tax Policy will need about $1.5 million to 
hire additional OTP, Office of Tax Policy Staff to write the 
regulations and rules. And IRS will be faced with 
implementation of many of the features of this.
    And there is money included in the budget. I believe an 
additional $10.5 million for IT funds. And an additional 
roughly $5.5 million, and this would go from fiscal year 2023 
through 2027 for additional lawyers in the Chief Counsel staff.
    Senator Murray. Okay. Thank you for that summary, and I 
will be following that very carefully as we put this bill 
together. As I mentioned, I do expect from you a detailed plan 
about how the IRS is intending to use IRA money. Without that, 
we are hearing all kinds of conflated things about 87,000 
people and an army kind of thing. But tell us when we are going 
to see that plan so we can see the detail of----
    Secretary Yellen. In a matter of weeks. I have seen a draft 
of the plan. It is not final, but you should see it very 
shortly.
    Senator Murray. Okay, we need to see that because it is 
really important----
    Secretary Yellen. Of course.
    Senator Murray [continuing]. For taxpayers to be able to 
call the IRS and get a response. It is really important for us 
to be able to have the new technology we need, but we need to 
see your spend plans so we have a real concrete----
    Secretary Yellen. You will see that.
    Senator Murray. Okay. And finally, I know President Biden's 
2024 budget is rightly called a blue collar blueprint to 
rebuild America, and that blueprint would not only help 
families with lower health care costs, but also invest in 
quality child care, ensure giant corporations and billionaires 
pay their fair share a lot more, but I wanted to ask you, do 
you think that the President's budget would increase inflation 
or put us on a fast path to fiscal ruin, as some of our 
colleagues have suggested?
    Secretary Yellen. No, I don't. It is--it does invest in 
America, in our people, in our economy, in ways that will make 
it more productive, but it proposes ways to pay for that. And, 
in fact, over 10 years, it involves deficit reduction amounting 
to $3 trillion, so it puts us on a more secure and prudent 
fiscal path.
    It--many of the investments that are proposed could be 
viewed as expanding supply. Senator Hagerty mentioned the 
importance of supply and inflation as a matter of supply and 
demand. And the supply side of our economy is important.
    We know that private investment capital formation matters, 
and that is what traditional supply side economics has always 
focused on. I have coined the term modern supply side 
economics. I believe the supply side of the economy is 
important, but there are other kinds of investments that are 
also critical, and that is what is included in this budget.
    Funding for education, human capital, investing in people, 
investing in cares for children, in childcare, early childhood 
education, enabling more people to work, investing in research 
and development that improve our technology and productivity.
    So, there are some very significant investments in our 
economy that will expand its capacity and ability to supply 
goods and services.
    Senator Murray. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Madam Chair. And now we will 
turn to the Ranking Member of the full Committee, Senator 
Collins.
    Senator Collins. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It is 
great to be here with you and the Ranking Member and appreciate 
it. Secretary Yellen, I want to talk with you about the 
consequences of the decision that was made by Treasury in 
consultation with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to use a 
systemic risk exception in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to 
insure all of the deposits of Silicon Valley Bank.
    Last Wednesday, the new CEO of this bank held a conference 
call for concerned clients, and he urged them to return all of 
their deposits to the bank. And here is what he said on that 
call, and I am going to quote it. ``There is no safer place in 
the U.S. banking system to put your deposits.''
    I am very troubled by that comment because it invites 
deposit flows from well-managed, prudently invested community 
banks to a bank that was poorly managed, that took excessive 
risks.
    And it seems to me by guaranteeing all of the deposits, 
that you are creating a situation where they are immune from 
losses, draw in deposits from well-managed banks in a way that 
puts the well-managed community bank at a competitive 
disadvantage.
    So, I guess my question to you is, how is this fair?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, look, we invoked the systemic risk 
exception because Silicon Valley Bank had experienced a 
calamitous run, a run that was so enormous that it overwhelmed 
the liquidity of this bank, its ability to arrange liquidity.
    And it created the potential for fear about the safety of 
uninsured depositors in many other banks. And a failure to 
protect those who were uninsured depositors in this bank at the 
time it was put into receivership would have led to fears by 
uninsured depositors at many other banks who really have no 
easy way of knowing what the status of their banks are and 
whether or not their funds are at risk.
    It risked contagion throughout the banking system. We 
invoked this exception in order to try to contain the contagion 
that seemed to all of us to be inherent in these uninsured 
depositors being wiped out or severely gutted.
    So, it wasn't a question of protecting that bank or that 
group of uninsured depositors, but rather the implications for 
the broader banking system because of the contagion potential.
    Senator Collins. Well, I want to switch to relate it by 
different topics. But to me, it creates a situation where you 
are rewarding very wealthy depositors and you are creating the 
need for a special assessment that is going to be imposed on 
those well-managed community banks that don't take--didn't take 
those risks.
    And from what the bankers I have talked to tell me, the 
majority of their depositors fall under the $250,000 limit. 
Well, at Silicon Valley Bank, the opposite was true. But let me 
follow up on a point that Senator Hegarty made.
    He asked you about the level of FDIC insurance. I remember 
in 2008 when it was raised from $100,000 to $250,000 during 
that financial crisis. Now, some of our colleagues, including 
Senator Elizabeth Warren, has recommended that we raise up to 
$2 million or even up to $10 million. Do you agree with that?
    Secretary Yellen. You know, what I am focused on right now 
is trying to stabilize the banking system. And I know our 
banking system to be sound, and I think right now we need to 
focus on improving the confidence of the public that we do have 
a sound banking system. And we can debate in the days ahead 
whether or not $250,000 is the right level for deposit 
insurance, or whether that system could be--should be changed 
in some way. I am not going to weigh in on it.
    I believe there is plenty of time to have reasoned 
discussions about that. For now, I want to use the tools that 
we do have at our disposal to improve confidence and make sure 
the banks that are faced with deposit outflows have adequate 
access to liquidity.
    The steps that the Federal Reserve took in the aftermath of 
that bank failure to make liquidity more broadly available to 
support deposits, that is an important step that went with the 
steps that we took as well.
    Senator Collins. Let me very quickly switch to a different 
issue. You said in your statement that the IRS is answering a 
million more calls than last year. That sounds good.
    But the fact is that the Inspector General for Tax 
Administration calculates their own collar response figure 
based on the data they collect from the IRS, and for this 
filing season through March 4, the Inspector General calculates 
that the IRS has only responded to 52 percent of calls, and 
that if you add together both automated calls and calls 
answered by an IRS customer service representative, that the 
number of calls that are answered declines to even more, to 
only 29 percent of the calls are answered by an IRS customer 
service representative.
    So, I hope we will follow up and try to get to the bottom 
of that. I can tell you, based on the casework in my offices in 
Maine, and I have six offices, that they are having an 
extremely difficult time getting answers from the IRS.
    Secretary Yellen. Senator, I would be glad to look into 
that. I am not aware of the report that you just mentioned. We 
have been tracking on a weekly basis the IRS's performance 
during this tax season and it has been running between 80 and 
90 percent. That is a very different number than you mentioned.
    And I would be glad, I will ask my staff to try to 
reconcile that discrepancy. But I personally promise that this 
tax season, that--so I don't know if you are talking--are you 
talking about the entire year or the tax----
    Senator Collins. The tax season through March 4. And it is 
a report by the Inspector General for Tax Administration.
    Secretary Yellen. I will look into that because I have been 
told its average is 85 percent, in line with the promise that I 
personally made.
    Senator Van Hollen. Senator, thank you. Thank you. Senator 
Heinrich.
    Senator Heinrich. Thank you, Chairman. Welcome, Madam 
Secretary. We have had some discussion here on the deficit, and 
I thought it might be helpful if you could remind us of the 
relative role of the Trump tax cuts in creating the current 
structural deficit.
    Secretary Yellen. Well, the Trump tax cuts added hugely to 
the deficit. I wish I recalled, it was something like $2 
trillion over 10 years. And so that is a major contributor to 
the deficits that we have.
    Senator Heinrich. Pivoting quickly to the banking 
situation, as Chair designate of the Joint Economic Committee 
(JEC), I was very pleased that the Administration acted quickly 
to ensure that small banks and depositors don't take the brunt 
of the Silicon Valley Bank failure.
    But I also suspect that this is a disaster that could have 
been prevented. When Congress voted to roll back key regulatory 
provisions back in 2018, I was also Vice Chair of the JEC at 
the time, and I warned that weakening these rules put the 
health of the banking system at risk.
    And in fact, I have released a report, a JEC report, that 
named SVB Financial Group specifically as one of the banks that 
would face nearly none of the enhanced regulations originally 
put in place in the Dodd-Frank legislation.
    How can regulators shore up confidence and stability in 
this asset class of banks? And do they need additional tools in 
order to improve the stability throughout the entire financial 
system?
    Secretary Yellen. So, I absolutely think that it is 
appropriate to conduct a very thorough review of what factors 
were responsible for the failure of these banks. And it is true 
that there was legislation that weakened bank regulation, and 
there were also regulatory decisions by the Federal Reserve and 
other banking agencies.
    There is also a question of supervision in how that is 
conducted. I was pleased to see that Vice Chair for 
Supervision, the Fed's Vice Chair for Supervision, Michael 
Barr, is undertaking and will report by May on an investigation 
of what is involved.
    And certainly, we should be reconsidering what we need to 
shore up regulation to prevent this. This was a very unusual 
set of circumstances the Silicon Valley Bank faced. It appears 
that they had seen a significant interest rate risk that they 
were subject to, and an exceptionally high, over 90 percent of 
their deposits were uninsured. And that is, you know----
    Senator Heinrich. That number is well outside of the norm.
    Secretary Yellen. So, in that sense, this was an unusual 
bank, but I think it is appropriate to review all of that.
    Senator Heinrich. Do you have any thoughts at all on the 
nature of--I mean, this is basically our first digital bank run 
in a way--the way that the fire sort of spread.
    Secretary Yellen. Yes.
    Senator Heinrich. How should we be thinking about that in 
the role of providing proper oversight and de-risking these 
financial institutions going forward, given that that is very 
much the world we live in now?
    Secretary Yellen. So, this was an overwhelmingly rapid run 
on a bank. To the best of my knowledge, we have never seen 
deposits flee at the pace that they did from Silicon Valley 
Bank. Now, many of the depositors were, you know, startup tech 
firms that work with venture capitalists that also bank.
    And there was, as you say, on the Internet essentially 
shouting fire in a movie theater. And it perhaps it is the case 
that now in the world we live in, that although this was a 
small community with a disproportionate share of Silicon Valley 
Bank's deposits, this kind of thing may more readily happen 
now.
    And it means that in general, when we do liquidity stress 
tests on banks, where we think about liquidity requirements, 
perhaps some of the assumptions that go into modeling the pace 
at which deposits might flee, maybe some of those need to be 
updated and rethought. But this is a new phenomenon and we 
haven't seen this before.
    Senator Heinrich. I think it is an important question----
    Secretary Yellen. We need to rethink it.
    Senator Heinrich. It is the world we live in today. Some 
House Republicans recently introduced a bill that would force 
Treasury to prioritize covering debt held by foreign debt 
holders like the Chinese government before financing Department 
of Defense, the VA, really every Federal funding priority 
outside of Social Security and Medicare.
    You have referred to this plan as default by another name 
and have pointed out that it is really not logistically 
feasible for Treasury to prioritize payments given how Treasury 
operates. What do you think of this plan to prioritize things 
like foreign investments over current and former service 
members and other obligations that we have as Federal 
Government?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, we have a set of bills that come 
due, and it is our obligation and my obligation as Treasury 
Secretary to see that those bills are paid, and not some of the 
bills, and to decide which bills are more important than other 
bills, simply to pay the bills for programs in spending that 
Congress has authorized.
    That is why I say prioritization is default by another 
name. Not paying any of our bills is default. And when you 
think about the pain that it would cause to Social Security 
recipients, to food stamp recipients, you name it, people to 
vendors who supply services to the Government and have their 
own payrolls to meet, to be told they are not going to be paid, 
the Government isn't going to honor those bills.
    That is a default. And reading rating agencies, 
particularly Fitch, has already clearly indicated that a 
failure to pay all of the government's bills when they are due 
would certainly compromise our credit rating. So, this has 
never been tried. It has been rejected by all past Treasury 
secretaries.
    And I would say our systems, or payment systems, are simply 
set up to pay all the government's bills when they come due. 
They are not set up to divide payments into different types as 
a general matter and to be able to say, yes, this, this, this 
and this we are paying.
    And these other things we are holding back for many 
agencies, payments of all types are all mixed together in ways 
that couldn't be disentangled.
    Senator Heinrich. Thank you, Chairman.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator Heinrich. Senator 
Kennedy.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, Madam 
Secretary. Madam Secretary, isn't it a fact that the 
President's proposed budget for next fiscal year is a half a 
trillion dollars more than this fiscal year?
    Secretary Yellen. On the spending side?
    Senator Kennedy. Yes, that is what a budget is.
    Secretary Yellen. Yes. It is about $400 billion----
    Senator Kennedy. It is about $500 billion more, right?
    Secretary Yellen. It is about what?
    Senator Kennedy. $500 billion more, right?
    Secretary Yellen. About that.
    Senator Kennedy. Isn't it a fact that since 2019 until 
today, I am not including the extra $500 billion that you all 
want to spend, since 2019 through today, U.S. population has 
increased 1.8 percent and the Federal Government's budget is up 
55 percent. Isn't that a fact?
    Secretary Yellen. But we had a pandemic.
    Senator Kennedy. Isn't that a fact, though? I mean----
    Secretary Yellen. I don't know those numbers.
    Senator Kennedy. You don't know? You never looked at that?
    Secretary Yellen. I don't have those numbers in my head. 
Well, I am not disputing them.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Isn't it a fact that the President's 
proposed budget proposes $4.7 trillion in new taxes?
    Secretary Yellen. It does propose significant additional 
taxes, yes.
    Senator Kennedy. $4.7 trillion.
    Secretary Yellen. Something like that, yes.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. You talked about reducing deficit. 
Isn't it a fact that under President Biden's proposed budget, 
that gross debt will rise from $32.7 trillion at the close of 
this year to $51 trillion by 2033?
    Secretary Yellen [continuing]. What number did you give me 
for----?
    Senator Kennedy. The President's proposed budget will 
increase gross debt from $33 trillion at the close of this year 
to $51 trillion in 2033? Isn't that correct?
    Secretary Yellen. Well debt held by the public, which is--
--
    Senator Kennedy. No, ma'am, that is gross debt. Isn't that 
a fact?
    Secretary Yellen. That is probably a fact.
    Senator Kennedy. So, you haven't reduced the deficit, have 
you?
    Secretary Yellen. The deficit, the debt and deficits are 
reduced by the President's budget.
    Senator Kennedy. How can you go from $33 trillion to $51 
trillion and call that a reduction in the deficit?
    Secretary Yellen. Because that is a calculation for which 
you need a baseline. And then you compare the budget and the 
deficits and debt in the budget with the baseline in which 
there are none of the changes either in revenues or in spending 
that are----
    Senator Kennedy. Here is my baseline--and here is my 
baseline, at the end of this year, we project--people a lot 
smarter than me, probably not than you but smarter than me--say 
that gross debt is $33 trillion. They say if the President's 
budget is implemented by 2033, it will be $51 trillion. Isn't 
that a fact?
    Secretary Yellen. If the President's budget is not 
implemented and none of the changes are made, it will be worse 
than that. And so, the President's budget has improved the 
fiscal outlook relative to what we would have without the 
President's proposals.
    Senator Kennedy. Even though it raises a gross debt from 
$33 trillion to $51 trillion, you say that is an improvement?
    Secretary Yellen. It is. It is an improvement because it 
raises taxes by more and it leads to----
    Senator Kennedy. That includes taxes. In what world is that 
an improvement other than Washington and la la land?
    Secretary Yellen. It is an improvement in that the revenue 
increases far exceed proposed investments.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. All right. Let me ask you this, 
isn't it a fact that in January of 2019, the Federal Reserve 
issued a warning to Silicon Valley Bank over its risk 
management systems?
    Secretary Yellen. I have no idea. I am not responsible in 
any way.
    Senator Kennedy. But you are in charge of the banking 
bailouts and the crisis, right?
    Secretary Yellen. I am not involved in banking supervision 
and I don't have access to any information about the 
supervision of Silicon Valley Bank.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. So, you don't know whether or not 
the Fed, you haven't looked to see whether or not the Fed 
issued a warning, what, 4 years ago to the bank over its risk 
management systems?
    Secretary Yellen. That is not public information and it is 
not for me----
    Senator Kennedy. Sure, it is--Wall Street Journal.
    Secretary Yellen. Well, it may be in The Wall Street 
Journal, but it is not public information and it is not 
information that I have access to.
    Senator Kennedy. Well, I will give you a copy of this 
article.
    Secretary Yellen. I read the article, but----
    Senator Kennedy. The Fed issued a matter requiring 
attention, and it said your risk management practices are 
terrible and you need to improve them.
    Secretary Yellen. That is what the article says.
    Senator Kennedy. All right. Isn't it fact that months 
before SVB went under, that the bank disclosed that its market-
to-market value of its bonds was $16 billion less than their 
balance sheet value?
    Secretary Yellen. They did make such a statement.
    Senator Kennedy. Did the people at the Federal Reserve just 
not read it?
    Secretary Yellen. I am not in the Federal Reserve.
    Senator Kennedy. I know.
    Secretary Yellen. I was at the Federal Reserve----
    Senator Kennedy. But you are in the Treasury and you are in 
charge of the banking crisis. Let me ask you----
    Secretary Yellen. I am not in-charge of the supervision of 
the bank.
    Senator Kennedy. Let me ask you this. Senator Heinrich 
talked about the 2018 amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act. Isn't 
it a fact--now SVB was not stress tested in 2022, 34 banks 
were. Here is the Fed's report. Isn't it a fact that if SVB had 
been stress tested, it would have passed?
    Secretary Yellen. Stress tests look at capital of a bank.
    Senator Kennedy. Here is the--yes, ma'am, under the stress 
test. Isn't it a fact that SVB would have passed?
    Secretary Yellen. I don't know--it wasn't stress----
    Senator Kennedy. Well, you need to look into that, Madam 
Secretary.
    Secretary Yellen. I said this is not my job, this is the 
Federal Reserve's job.
    Senator Kennedy. Isn't it a fact that when the Federal 
Reserve stress tested in 2022, it only stress tested credit 
risk and didn't stress test duration risk. Isn't that a fact?
    Secretary Yellen. You know, I believe the stress tests in 
general partially address and take account of interest rate.
    Senator Kennedy. No, ma'am. I have read it. Here it is, 
bigger than Dallas.
    Secretary Yellen. Well, to the extent that there are assets 
held in an available for sale portfolio that would suffer 
losses due to changing interest rates, that would be captured 
in the banks----
    Senator Kennedy. No, ma'am, it is not there. I have read 
it.
    Senator Van Hollen. Senator Kennedy, I have allowed people 
to--the Secretary to stray over answers that were asked before 
the time went out, but not a series of questions after the time 
went out, but----
    Senator Kennedy. Sure, I get it. I understand, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. And thank you, Senator 
Kennedy. And let me, I worked together with Senator Kennedy on 
lots of things. We have got a good working relationship. I am 
pleased to have done it.
    We have some disagreements, and some of those questions 
have prompted me just to ask you some follow up on some of 
these issues. I just want to underscore the point you made, 
that the President's budget, President Biden's budget reduces 
the deficit over the next 10 years by $3 trillion relative to 
if we did nothing. Is that right?
    Secretary Yellen. That is correct. That is what I think I 
said in answer to Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Van Hollen. Right.
    Secretary Yellen. We need a baseline. Then you look at the 
budget, and you compare deficits and debt in the two scenarios. 
And in that sense, there is a $3 trillion reduction in deficits 
relative to the standard.
    Senator Van Hollen. Right. I mean, if the Congress packed 
up its bags and left, which maybe some--lots of people would 
want us to do, and the President took no other action, the 
reality is 10 years from now, the deficit would be $3 trillion 
higher than if than it is today.
    Secretary Yellen. Yes.
    Senator Van Hollen. And isn't it a fact that one quarter of 
the total accumulated national debt was incurred during the 4 
years of the Trump Administration?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes.
    Senator Van Hollen. And isn't it a fact that during the 4 
years of the Trump Administration, Congress passed the debt 
ceiling increase three times without a lot of drama?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes.
    Senator Van Hollen. And Senator Heinrich asked you some 
questions about the proposal coming out of House Republicans 
for some kind of debt prioritization. And you made very clear 
that that is just default by another name, right?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes. Yes. It is not paying our bills.
    Senator Van Hollen. Right. And isn't it true that back in 
2011--I am having a sort of this is flashback on steroids. We 
were just getting close to that waterfall in the debt ceiling--
--
    Secretary Yellen. Yes.
    Senator Van Hollen. Led Senators to lower the rating of 
U.S. credit, right----
    Secretary Yellen. Yes. And that is why I have asked 
Congress to raise the debt ceiling expeditiously. We don't want 
to get to the X-date and push this because damage can occur and 
we could be downgraded if Congress looks like it is not willing 
to.
    Senator Van Hollen. I really hope, Madam Secretary, that we 
won't do that. I do welcome a vigorous debate with my 
colleagues on the budget issues. Whether you make spending 
cuts, whether you make revenue increases, people can have a 
healthy disagreement on that front.
    But that also does raise the issue of the IRS budget and 
the $80 billion that was presented, provided with the IRA for a 
number of functions, one of them being to allow the IRS to 
collect revenues that are already due and owing and not paid.
    Now, I have a couple of questions regarding that, Madam 
Secretary. One is you have directed the IRS and the Treasury 
Department that you will not increase audits above any 
historical level with respect to small businesses or taxpayers 
under $400,000, right?
    Secretary Yellen. I issued an order to that effect. I have 
told the IRS that they must not increase the audit rates on 
either individuals or small businesses earning under $400,000.
    Senator Van Hollen. And I think it was maybe--I think it 
was Jesse James who said when he is right--when he robbed 
banks, he said that is where the money is. Where the money is 
in uncollected taxes is in very wealthy, wealthy folks who are 
not paying their taxes on time, right?
    Secretary Yellen. That is right. It is wealthy individuals, 
complex partnerships, corporations, where there is particularly 
unreported income.
    Senator Van Hollen. Right. And I know that the 
Administration and the IRS have calculated hundreds of billions 
of dollars of lost income annually from this tax gap. But the 
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has a more conservative 
number, but it has a number nevertheless from the enactment of 
the Inflation Reduction Act.
    And it also calculated that the first act, I think it was 
the first act of the of the House under new leadership of 
Speaker McCarthy when they repealed the Inflation Reduction 
Act, according to CBO, that would increase the deficit relative 
to where we are today by $114 billion, right?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes. The money that we spent on--that you 
appropriate to the IRS, whether it is the discretionary budget 
or the additional long term mandatory investment in the IRS, 
this is money that brings in net more tax revenues.
    In that sense, it is not really costly. It generates more 
money for the taxpayer by enabling the IRS to collect the taxes 
that are owed than you are spending in appropriations on the 
agency.
    Senator Van Hollen. Right. So, you know, I hope in the 
coming weeks we can have a sober conversation up here about the 
budget and deficits, because it is one thing for our House 
colleagues to say they care about the debt ceiling, the 
deficit, and another thing for their very first action to be to 
increase the Federal budget deficit by over $114 billion over 
the next 10 years.
    Senator Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, can I ask a personal----
    Senator Van Hollen. Let me just ask my last question. I am 
happy to entertain the question if my other colleagues are 
willing. So, Madam Secretary, in terms of the IRS funding, in 
addition to trying to collect taxes from wealthy tax cheats, we 
have seen an improvement in IRS performance when it comes to 
answering constituents' calls. Is that not, correct?
    Secretary Yellen. That is certainly the reports that I have 
gotten, that the response rate has been between 80 and 90 
percent this tax year----
    Senator Van Hollen. And we are going to look, as Senator 
Collins raised some important questions here. It has definitely 
improved. Whether it has improved to that extent, according to 
the Inspector General, we will have to take a look at that.
    But I do think that making sure that folks who, especially 
very wealthy folks pay their taxes on time is important. And I 
am just going to, in closing here, refer you to a letter that a 
group of us sent on March 20, myself, Senator Warren, and 
others regarding abuses of trust that allow very, very wealthy 
individuals, billionaires to pass on lots of money without any 
taxation.
    They have very high-priced lawyers, which in our view are 
skirting the law, certainly the intent of the law. And we are 
asking you to take a look at that when you do that.
    Secretary Yellen. Yes, we actually have some proposals in 
the Green Book to clamp down on that type of abuse, and we 
would be glad to discuss further things we can do to prevent 
that kind of abuse.
    Senator Van Hollen. Got it. Senator Kennedy, it is up to 
Senator Hagerty, but I am happy to----
    Senator Kennedy. Well, I just wanted to ask, this is a 
question, not a comment, are we all going to--I mean, my 
colleague here hadn't had a chance to answer and ask any 
questions, but will we have a chance to follow up as well with 
the Secretary?
    Senator Van Hollen. Sure. Everyone is--we are doing another 
round. We have 7 minutes each. Absolutely. Absolutely. Senator 
Boozman.
    Senator Boozman. Thank you. Thanks for the pep talk. Thank 
you, Madam Secretary, for being here. And I would like to ask 
some questions that my community banks in Arkansas are 
concerned about.
    It is important to remember that Silicon Valley Bank and 
Signature Bank took on unique risks and were materially 
different from most U.S. banks, especially rural community 
banks are safe and sound.
    In light of those unique risk profiles, and I'm 
understanding that you aren't the FDIC chair, when determining 
whether to invoke the systemic risk exception, what specific 
data points, metrics, and factors do regulators focus on?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, we were very focused on the 
potential for the failure of these banks and losses to 
uninsured depositors in the banks to trigger runs on other 
banks. And we looked at things like deposit outflows from other 
banks, anecdotal reports that we heard.
    I will say that many mid-sized banks expressed great 
concern that they have uninsured deposits. Often these are 
local businesses that can't operate within the insured deposit 
limits. And these banks felt seeing many uninsured depositors 
having the view, the only place you are safe is in the largest 
banks, many of these banks felt very skittish about their 
potential to suffer runs as well.
    And I have heard this in many banking context that my staff 
and I have had in recent days, that there is concern. We can 
see that banks across the country are shoring up their 
liquidity. They are very worried about contagion from the 
troubles of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
    And the steps that we took were designed to improve the 
confidence of all depositors that they are safe in banks. And, 
you know, depositors often don't know about what the specific 
situation is of their bank, whether it is a mid-sized bank or a 
community bank, and if they become worried, they can pick up 
their deposits and go someplace they think is safer.
    And we did not want to see contagious runs that could have 
impacted many banks, including community banks.
    Senator Boozman. Very good. While Silicon Valley and 
Signature's uninsured deposits will be paid for by the Deposit 
Insurance Fund, banks will replenish the fund via a special 
assessment.
    In reality, those costs will be passed down to customers 
via higher banking costs, and I am concerned that Arkansans 
will have to subsidize Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank's 
deposits, and maybe others that come forward.
    What specific legal authority exist for Treasury, FDIC, 
and, or the Fed to exclude certain banks from being charged the 
special assessment, and will the community banks get charged 
that special assessment?
    Secretary Yellen. I don't know what the rules are around 
that precisely. I think the FDIC may have some ability to 
determine which banks are charged. I believe it is up to the 
FDIC to make that determination.
    Senator Boozman. And again, absent Congress passing a new 
law, what specific authority does Treasury, FDIC, and, or the 
Fed have to guarantee, even temporarily, all insured deposits 
of open banks?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, I mean, the FDIC, if it wished to 
put a program in place like the Tag Program that I think was 
instituted in 2008, that requires Congressional approval.
    Senator Boozman. Okay. Very good. Thank you. Turning to a 
different issue, can you provide a timeline for when Treasury, 
and, or IRS will write any further rule makings, guidance, or 
notices regarding the Inflation Reduction Act's direct pay 
provisions relating to tax exempt entities?
    Secretary Yellen. Are you referring--you are referring to 
the IRA?
    Senator Boozman. Yes, ma'am.
    Secretary Yellen. We have many rule makings we are required 
to do to implement the features of the IRA, and we are frankly 
working 24/7 to get them done as rapidly as we can. I can't 
give you an exact date, but I can tell you that we are working 
on it very hard. We are full tilt. These are some rather 
complex rules, and we are working very hard to get them out.
    Senator Boozman. Good. Thank you. The CDFI Fund is in the 
process of finalizing changes to its CDFI certification 
application. What analysis has Treasury done to understand the 
impact that the application changes will have on currently 
certified CDFIs? How will the changes impact recipients of 
Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) funds?
    Also, will depository institutions be less likely to meet 
certification requirements under the new standards? And if so, 
what impact will have on the--will that have on the Fund's 
ability to support investment and access to capital in 
underserved communities?
    Secretary Yellen. So, I really need to get back to you on 
that. I am not knowledgeable about the details of the change 
in--that you are referring to. Certainly, the CDFI Fund is 
trying to get money into the hands of CDFIs to lend in 
underserved communities, and certainly not to make it harder. 
And my staff will get back to yours, if that is okay----
    Senator Boozman. Yes, ma'am.
    Secretary Yellen. On the details of the question you asked.
    Senator Boozman. Well, thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator Boozman. Senator 
Hagerty.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Chair. And--just a couple of 
follow up questions. One, I would like to follow up on the 
point that Senator Kennedy touched, Secretary Yellen, and that 
has to do with the crisis that we just experienced with the 
banking community here. It is--the mantra of Washington seems 
to be never let a good crisis go to waste.
    There have been calls now that there need to be 
reregulation, that the tapering, I was not here when this was 
passed, but that the tapering that Senator Kennedy mentioned 
back in 2018, S. 2255, it was meant to take the one size fits 
all regulation and try to in some way make that better fit the 
market.
    That that is the reason for the failures that we have seen. 
What we have seen is a failure of management, as I mentioned 
earlier. You have got a management that was asleep at the wheel 
and out to lunch. They left their Chief Risk Officer position 
stay open for 8 months up to the failure.
    I am not aware of anything in S.2255 that would have fixed 
that problem. Are you, Madam Secretary?
    Secretary Yellen. Look, you know, we need to do a thorough 
review of what happened in the case of these bank failures, and 
I am not prepared to weigh in on precisely what the causes were 
at this point.
    Senator Hagerty. I will weigh in a little bit further and 
if you will accommodate me. There was also a failure at the San 
Francisco Fed in terms of the oversight that they should have 
been providing. Again, they were getting detailed liquidity 
reports, I believe, on a monthly basis about what was happening 
in Silicon Valley Bank.
    Yet they didn't seem, you know, they didn't seem to 
identify the problem nor did they address it in time. And I 
think the most disappointing failure of all is what happened 
during the weekend that the auction should have taken place. 
Rumors were rampant about slowness of the process, whether 
people were being encouraged or dissuaded from bidding.
    And at the end of the day, my understanding from FDIC 
official was that they did have a bidder, but they were not 
able to conclude the auction. We would be in a far better place 
right now had the FDIC concluded that auction.
    We were talking about a new buyer of the bank and we were 
in a position at this point to have contained the loss to, 
again this is the example of Silicon Valley Bank, as opposed to 
finding ourselves in a position where we have a much broader 
situation, where there is a precedent has been set now that, 
again, make many people in America wonder whether every deposit 
in America has been, you know, in some agreed to be backstopped 
or guaranteed.
    You have articulated the decision process that you would go 
through on a case-by-case basis, but I think, again, as I 
mentioned earlier, the bankers in my home State of Tennessee 
are very concerned whether they would be included or not.
    And there is a lot of uncertainty that we are going to have 
to get to the bottom of there. From that point, though, I would 
like to turn to just another issue, Secretary, and that has to 
do with the President's budget.
    The new budget lays out another $2.5 trillion of spending 
increases and going to the Treasury Green Book that you just 
mentioned a few minutes earlier, another $4.7 trillion of tax 
increases as well. Those tax increases, in my view, as you look 
at the Green Book, will have a lot more complications.
    We have already got an overcomplicated tax code. I think 
this promises to overcomplicate it further. The most recent 
estimate that I have seen shows that individuals and 
corporations spend 6.5 billion hours on tax filing and 
reporting already, and it is hard to imagine a system as 
complicated, as bureaucratic as it already is, getting more 
simple with the addition of another $4.7 trillion of new taxes.
    And my question of you, and you may need to get back to me 
on this, is how many more forms or instructions are going to be 
required from the IRS to the American public to address this. 
How many more hours will be required to fill out new forms and 
new overhead to address this massive new tax increase?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, I can't give you an estimate at 
this point of the number of hours or forms, but if Congress 
would consider seriously the proposals, we would be able to 
make estimates of those things.
    Senator Hagerty. I will certainly consider it seriously, 
but it is clear to me that it is not going to get any less 
complicated. It is going to be more complicated considerably by 
the way it is moving.
    Now, I just finish with this. I am very concerned again 
that the Green Book calls for more than $100 billion in 
targeted tax increases on fossil fuels, and talking about 
further increases on fossil fuels, further complicating that 
business at a time when our economic security and our national 
security are in such a grave situation.
    I think it really doubles down on the weaponization of our 
tax code against industries that are out of disfavor by this 
Administration, and it weakens us as a Nation. Anything that 
would lower investment in energy production right now will 
weaken our national security, so it is a grave concern.
    Secretary Yellen. I would say that fossil fuels have 
benefited from many special tax features that really are tax 
expenditures. They have benefited from that for decades. And at 
a time when we need to make a shift over time to clean energy, 
to be spending money to subsidize fossil fuels through the tax 
code is something that doesn't seem to our Administration to be 
appropriate.
    Senator Hagerty. Anything that increases the cost of 
producing energy right now, at a point we have had massive 
inflation in energy cost, and we are at a point right now where 
we cannot fulfill our obligations to our allies.
    It is putting our Nation at a point of weaker, weaker 
economic security, weaker national security. I think we should 
not be doing that. Thank you, Madam Secretary. Appreciate you 
being here. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator Hagerty. And I am 
going to turn it over to Senator Kennedy. Just one piece of 
business before that. If I run out before Senator Kennedy is 
finished asking his questions, I just want scout's honor, you 
will stay within the time limit, number one. I know you will. 
Thank you, my friend.
    And number two, in case I can't get back, let me just say, 
Madam Secretary, thank you for appearing before the 
subcommittee. And members will have one week to submit 
questions for the record due on March 29.
    And we would appreciate if your office could respond to 
those questions as soon as possible. Again, I will be here 
unless I get called up away, right, to get my questions up in 
another hearing. Thank you, Madam Secretary. Senator Kennedy.
    Secretary Yellen. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Kennedy. Scout's honor, Mr. Chairman. Madam 
Secretary, I thought I understood your proposed budget, and I 
want to walk you through it again. Isn't it a fact that the 
President's proposed budget increases spending by half a 
trillion dollars over the current budget?
    Secretary Yellen. There is an increase in 2024 over 2023 by 
about that much, and at least----
    Senator Kennedy. Isn't it a fact that the President's 
budget proposes new taxes of $4.7 trillion?
    Secretary Yellen. That is probably right. Yes.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. And isn't it a fact, I am talking 
about gross debt now, not public, not debt held by the public. 
Isn't it a fact that under the President's proposed budget, 
gross debt would go from $32.7 trillion at the close of this 
year to $50.7 trillion by 2033?
    Secretary Yellen. It is subject to statutory limitation. 
Yes, would go, as you said.
    Senator Kennedy. So, the President's budget would increase 
our debt by $18 trillion.
    Secretary Yellen. Which is $3 trillion less----
    Senator Kennedy. Right.
    Secretary Yellen. Than it would increase without the 
proposals in the President's budget.
    Senator Kennedy. So, what the President saying is these 
were my words, not his, because of his budget, we are going to 
have three heart attacks and a stroke instead of four heart 
attacks and a stroke.
    Secretary Yellen. Well, I would not agree that we are going 
to have three heart attacks and a stroke because we have a very 
large economy. And while the numbers that you cite are very big 
numbers, the size of our economy is also extremely large.
    And I think a better metric for assessing what the impact 
of the budget is on our economy and whether or not it is 
manageable is real net interest on--the real net interest 
payments that we have to make relative to the size of our 
economy.
    And those real net interest payments run throughout the 10 
years of the budget at around or under 1 percent of Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP), which is historically normal.
    So, debt is increasing, the size of the economy is 
increasing, interest rates are moving back toward more normal 
levels after a period of many years in which they were 
exceptionally low. And yet overall, what you see in this budget 
is real net interest on the debt, stabilizing at about 1 
percent of GDP, which is a manageable and historically normal 
number.
    Senator Kennedy. So, $51 trillion of debt up from 33 
trillion doesn't bother you?
    Secretary Yellen. I think the path that has been set out in 
the President's budget is fiscally sustainable.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. How much debt is too much? Tell me 
that.
    Secretary Yellen. Well, I just gave you the metric that I 
think is best for assessing fiscal sustainability.
    Senator Kennedy. Let me ask it in simpler terms. I didn't 
follow you there. It is what percentage of our GDP--what debt 
as a percentage of our GDP is too much?
    Secretary Yellen. So, it depends on what interest rates 
are. And real interest rates have been extremely low. This 
budget and previous budgets have projected that they would move 
up toward more normal levels over time, but certainly not the 
levels that we saw several decades ago. And----
    Senator Kennedy. Could you just answer my question, Madam 
Secretary. What percentage of--what percentage of debt of our 
GDP is too much?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, this budget has debt held by the 
public moving up to around 109 percent of GDP.
    Senator Kennedy. And that is not too much, in your opinion.
    Secretary Yellen. Historically, it is a high level, but on 
the other hand, interest rates, real interest rates have moved 
down substantially in recent decades. And so higher levels of 
debt to GDP are sustainable with lower real interest rates. And 
on balance, as I said, the interest burden of the debt is at a 
level that is quite reasonable in historic terms.
    Senator Kennedy. Madam Secretary, are you a Keynesian?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, I don't quite know what you mean by 
that, but I certainly----
    Senator Kennedy. Do believe that it is acceptable, indeed 
it is admirable for government when you are in a slow period of 
recession or more than a recession to stimulate the economy by 
spending--by borrowing money and spending.
    Secretary Yellen. It certainly can be. I certainly----
    Senator Kennedy. That is what I mean by Keynesian. Do you 
support that?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, there are different tools that can 
be used to stimulate an economy that is in a downturn, and it 
is--monetary policy is an alternative tool. And----
    Senator Kennedy. But let me go back to my question. Keynes 
said that when you are in a recession, you can borrow money and 
spend it, government can, to stimulate the economy and get you 
out of the recession.
    Secretary Yellen. Well, I am not going to make a blanket 
statement that I agree with that.
    Senator Kennedy. Well, let me ask you if you agree with 
this, a lot of people who say they are Keynesians, and based on 
what I have read of your writings you are Keynesian, they 
forget the second part of what Keynes said. He said, after you 
get out of the recession, you pay the money back. Did he not?
    Secretary Yellen. I don't recall that he said that.
    Senator Kennedy. He said it. I will show you that one too.
    Secretary Yellen. Show that to me.
    Senator Kennedy. I promised the Chairman I wouldn't go over 
and I want to yield back 2 seconds.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. And I am 
hoping that you would agree that all economists would agree 
that it is a bad idea to default on our debt. As we still try 
to figure out how to deal with these budget issues, I look 
forward to a conversation. This has been a good, I think, good 
discussion for all.
    Thank you to the Members. Madam Secretary, thank you. And 
the hearing is adjourned. Well, Madam Secretary, I have--
Senator Manchin has just arrived. I am going to give him 
seven--I am going to, as I said earlier, Madam Secretary, I am 
going to have to depart.
    My other colleagues here may have to depart. This is--we 
will give seven--thank you, Senator Kennedy. But, Senator 
Manchin, you have got 7 minutes here, and I am going to--you 
will close out the hearing, all right. Thank you.
    Senator Manchin. Thank you so much. I am so sorry. Hello, 
everybody. I am so sorry. I am glad you stayed. Madam 
Secretary, I know we have an awful lot to talk about, and you 
have been so kind in sharing and giving me some of your time in 
the meeting with you. But I think on the record, I would like 
to have a few things that we can talk about, on the record, and 
make sure that we do.
    First of all, you know, with all this going on and there is 
a lot of talk about the bank and this and that, and I think it 
was Senator Hagerty who was talking about over the $250,000. I 
have been talking to a few colleagues and we were just 
wondering if it is--and, you know, you said you haven't gotten 
to that point yet.
    So, let's say 90 percent of my West Virginia deposits are 
under $250,000. And now they are going to pay a little bit 
higher premiums, I guess, or higher bank fees or somebody is 
going to pay. Is the bank absorbing that or will be passed on 
to the consumer?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, it is not obvious that it would be 
passed on to the consumer. I suppose it could be, but it may 
also be absorbed by the--it is a special one-time assessment--
--
    Senator Manchin. If we are assuming that could happen, and 
maybe it could be the consumers, okay. They understand, you 
know, the bankers, I had all the community bankers in. What 
they believe would be unfair, they said, listen, we are in good 
shape. We move money around.
    So, if we have a depositor that has $1 million, this one 
banker says, you know, I will call three of my friends and say, 
can I move $250,000 to you, $250,000 to you, and $250,000 to 
you. We do that all the time to make sure everyone is covered. 
That is my response.
    He said, that is my risk responsibility, which made all the 
sense in the world. So, I know a lot of tools that we already 
have, but sometimes it is just bad banking practices. They all 
come to the conclusion they felt the San Francisco Feds did not 
do their job.
    They thought they were, you know, laxed in basically what 
they should have enforced. It was 8 months without a risk 
manager at the bank, SVB, that they knew of. Is that factual?
    Secretary Yellen. Senator Manchin, I am not involved--it is 
the Federal Reserve in California that are involved in the 
supervision of that bank. I am not involved. I have read some 
newspaper stories about this, but this is not in the public 
domain and I don't know.
    Senator Manchin. Well, for the record, I think you did the 
right thing when you all made your decision on taking care of 
depositors, but not the bank bailout and not the shareholders 
and all that. And I think there is a claw back. There is--you 
understand there is legislation for claw back.
    Secretary Yellen. Yes.
    Senator Manchin. Because we think that there were nefarious 
acts by those responsible to protect themselves and the heck 
with our depositors and all the other people have fallen prey 
to this. So, we are hoping that you all can look at that, maybe 
give us your blessing.
    Secretary Yellen. Yes, certainly.
    Senator Manchin. And in the $250,000 above, I was just 
going to ask you this, from $250,000 and above, it was--to me 
the reasonability would be if I need to keep about $2 million 
in the bank because of payroll and inventory reasons, and I 
normally secure it at what $250,000.
    I got a $1,750,000 at stake. Could I be able--should I be 
able to buy or pay a little higher bank fee to get protection 
up to the amount with a cap maybe at ten, something--I am 
just--we have been talking, some Senators have been talking 
back and forth. Could the FDIC, and I think they said it would 
take the legislation----
    Secretary Yellen. It would take a legislation.
    Senator Manchin. I don't think we should do it without you 
all involved showing us how to structure that. But if I could 
go back to my bankers and says, for those businesses you might 
have and even rural areas--they have to keep large amounts of 
cash because they need that. Now that they know that they are 
exposed, they would be the first ones to move to the bigger 
banks.
    Secretary Yellen. That is exactly right.
    Senator Manchin. So, they are worried about that. And they 
said if you could offer some type of insurance policy, that 
they would pay for. So, the $250,000, 80 to 90 percent of in 
rural areas, aren't going to be saddled with accommodating 
somebody that needs that type of protection.
    Secretary Yellen. I think often the uninsured depositors, 
especially in community banks, are local businesses that have 
payroll and can't manage with----
    Senator Manchin. Does that type of evaluation make sense to 
you? Does it make----
    Secretary Yellen. I think this is very worthwhile, you 
know, for you and your colleagues to be discussing what is 
appropriate here, and we would be more than willing to work 
with you to think this through. It is worthwhile. Look, we are 
for the moment, we are trying to stabilize the situation using 
the tools at our disposal. But there certainly are----
    Senator Manchin. Yes, I mean, these are questions asked by 
reasonable people in the business and they are just saying----
    Secretary Yellen. Of course, yes----
    Senator Manchin [continuing]. If you are going to do 
something, rather than just now saying--they think if you set a 
precedent now that they are expecting the feds to bail 
everybody out, and I don't think that is what our intentions 
are.
    Secretary Yellen. I don't think that that is going to be 
needed. But we don't want to see contagious bank runs and a 
loss in confidence in our banking system, especially when the 
banking system is overall for the United States, very sound.
    Senator Manchin. And this--this subcommittee hopefully will 
have Mr. Jerome Powell of the Feds telling us basically what 
they have been able to do since the CBB has happened as far as 
to enforce the oversight by the San Francisco Reserve and all 
the different reserves we have around the country. If they are 
looking at their more troubled areas, if you will.
    Secretary Yellen. It has been announced that Vice Chair for 
Supervision, Michael Barr, will do a thorough review of the 
supervision of this bank.
    Senator Manchin. Now, I know this is in your bailiwick, 
okay. I know that the White House is currently working with the 
EU on a limited trade agreement that will allow them to become 
eligible for the first half of the EV credits.
    What we are concerned about is, you know, I know the EU and 
I am fine. I said, I don't have a problem with our allies. What 
I have a problem with is going to countries that we don't have 
what we would call a secure supply chain.
    So, when we wrote the bill, we wrote, as you know I have 
spoken about this before, we wrote it with free trade 
agreements for us to have a free trade agreement, we knew there 
had to be more of a--more of a confidence that we are going to 
have a pretty good supply chain and not be held hostage.
    Some of these other countries where an awful lot of the 
minerals come from are not in the EU. If you are trying to 
expand and the White House tries to expand that beyond, we are 
back in that critical situation where we have unreliable supply 
chains, where the Chinas, the Russias, the Irans, the North 
Koreas, all the different people who have various trade 
activities, they sometimes use unscrupulous tactics to hold 
those people hostage.
    And they have already had a pretty good stake in it. I can 
assure you that was not the intent of how we wrote the bill.
    Secretary Yellen. Senator Manchin, I understand that the 
intent of the bill is that we should have secure supply chains, 
and any agreements that we would look at, and of course we will 
consult closely with you and with Congress, would be meant to 
make sure that we are securing our supply chains as the 
legislation is----
    Senator Manchin. Well, you have been--we might respectfully 
at times agree to disagree on some things, but at least you 
have been kind enough to sit down and work with me, and I 
appreciate that. And we want to keep that going. I think we 
have furnished you with the concerns we had----
    Secretary Yellen. Yes.
    Senator Manchin [continuing]. With production, you know, 
sourcing critical minerals, and processing versus the 
manufacturing, and why we think there is a difference there, 
and why we think it is imperative we keep that difference, 
okay.
    And if we don't keep that difference, then basically this 
material, that they're considering part of the processing, 
which goes in the manufacturing portion, does not go into the 
processing at all. Processing is taking the raw materials, raw 
minerals and processing them into a form, then goes into----
    Secretary Yellen. And using it----
    Senator Manchin. Okay. That is the differences. And we 
think that is very clear. And more, hopefully, that before you 
all come out with the rule and all that, we have more input in 
that or we are on the same page because that one causes a lot 
of problems.
    Secretary Yellen. So, I believe we are on the same page. We 
are working very hard on the rule and have said that we will 
get this rule out by the end of March, where we are certainly 
trying to meet that deadline. And have been consulting with you 
and your staff and broadly understand----
    Senator Manchin. One final question, since I haven't put 
the clock on myself right now, but I am watching them go--don't 
tell on me. One final question. Knowing what we have and how 
critical the financial situation can be and just what the bank 
thing, just that one thing, what it did to our psyche, if you 
will, and our whole, could have unraveled so many things, 
right, with the SVB and all that started.
    When you don't have the financial house in order, right now 
I would venture to say, what would you recommend we evaluate in 
how we operate our Government and our finances of our 
Government right now?
    So, we are looking at all these other things. I hear about 
stress testing and all the things that goes on to evaluate, are 
they in a critical position or not? What do you think we could 
do to look at how we operate here?
    And I want to be very clear, the way that both sides, 
Democrats and Republicans, are approaching the debt ceiling, 
there is not one person as far as out of 100 Senators that I 
truly in their heart believe that we should not hold anything 
hostage about paying our debts, or missing that, or going into 
default.
    I really believe that in my heart. With that, I do not 
believe it is unreasonable for my friends and colleagues on the 
Republican side to say, can we sit down. Now if they are going 
to say, I will not vote to raise the debt ceiling unless you 
pass this, this, and this, I would not agree. That is a wrong 
approach.
    Would we sit down and we can agree that we should be 
looking at these portions of our debt and how we have 
accumulated so much debt so fast. We know what we did with 
COVID. Take COVID out of the picture. We know what--how the 
rest of it. Or do we know how the rest of it accumulated in 
such a short period of time, especially since 2001. But even 
looking at 2013, the last 10 years, it has been unbelievable.
    And the projections from Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) doesn't quit. So, it scares the bejesus out of me and all 
the trust funds. I am hopefully that we can come to an 
agreement. And if you all would be receptive to considering, 
should we come to an agreement, that we can basically look at 
all of these things and within a 90-day period, come back with 
some recommendations and get a vote either up or down?
    We are not holding anything hostage. We are voting to pay 
our bills. And all we have agreed on is we are going to put a 
bipartisan, bicameral group together to look at trust funds and 
look at the different things that are very vulnerable, the same 
as you do with a bank when you send your examiners in.
    Secretary Yellen. Senator Manchin, I believe being on a 
fiscally sustainable course is critical for our Nation, and we 
should sit down and have a very reasoned discussion about what 
is necessary to accomplish that. The President has offered to 
have discussions, but not with the sword of Damocles----
    Senator Manchin [continuing]. Put forward, if you don't go, 
if we don't--yes----
    Secretary Yellen [continuing]. We are going to not pay your 
bills and have financial and economic chaos.
    Senator Manchin. If I was capable of bringing some people 
together on both sides and says, listen, let's sit down and 
talk about what we think, that we could basically come and look 
at over a 3-month period to come back with a guaranteed vote on 
the floor, if we make recommendations, you don't have to vote 
for it.
    And I they think, oh, it might be too toxic. I don't care 
what you think, let's look and see how we get our finances in 
order, because we are not right now. And knowing what happened 
to the banks, you put all this in a concern, could that happen 
to our country?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, we should be stress testing our 
fiscal just as we stress test banks. We should be looking at 
what we----
    Senator Manchin. But we don't, do we?
    Secretary Yellen [continuing]. Think what will happen in a 
base case, and what happens----
    Senator Manchin. In worst case----
    Secretary Yellen. In alternative better and worse 
scenarios----
    Senator Manchin. But I have been here for 12 years, Madam 
Secretary, and I have not had that happen or anyone approached 
me with that. So, I am glad that you have said that. And I 
think that you are right on.
    Well, I want you to know, I won't participate and will not 
participate by holding anybody hostage. I will vote for the 
debt ceiling. But I would vote with the understanding that at 
least we can have a conversation with a guaranteed vote in 90 
days on changes we think need to be made.
    And I think that is a responsible, reasonable approach. So 
hopefully you can talk to your--to the White House and I will 
be talking to them, too, and seeing if they would agree to 
something such as that.
    Secretary Yellen. I mean, I know the President is open to 
discussions on this topic.
    Senator Manchin. Well, with that, sometimes it pays to be 
late. I had so many--I am so sorry to keep you this--but let me 
just say, I want to thank you, Madam Secretary, and your staff 
for being so accommodating and forthright with us and coming 
before and appearing before the subcommittee.
    Our members will have one week to submit questions for the 
record, which are due March 29. I would appreciate if your 
office can respond to those questions as soon as possible.

                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but 
were submitted to the agencies for response subsequent to the 
hearing:]
              Questions Submitted to Hon. Janet L. Yellen
              Questions Submitted by Senator Bill Hagerty
    Question 1. The SEC's ``dealer'' proposal would create a 
quantitative threshold for the amount of Treasuries a firm could trade 
without being forced to register as a dealer. I have significant 
concerns with the negative impact this will have on Treasury liquidity. 
My colleagues and I have sent letters to the SEC and to you on this 
issue, but have not received sufficient responses.

  --Secretary Yellen, may you please lay out the specific steps the 
        Treasury Department is taking to ensure the SEC isn't damaging 
        the Treasury market with this proposal?

    Answer. Treasury is collaborating with its fellow members of the 
Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), 
which includes the SEC, to evaluate a range of potential policies to 
enhance the resilience of the Treasury market. In November 2022, the 
IAWG published a Staff Progress Report, outlining the significant 
progress made towards its goals and highlighting ongoing workstreams, 
including a discussion of the SEC's dealer and government securities 
dealer registration rule proposal. As indicated in the Staff Progress 
Report, the SEC's staff is considering comments received on this rule 
proposal in making recommendations for the SEC's consideration. 
Treasury will continue to work with the IAWG on this and other policy 
options to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market.

                                 ______
                                 
              Questions Submitted by Senator John Boozman
    Question 1. FinCEN has received widespread criticism that its 
proposed rule concerning access to the beneficial ownership registry is 
not consistent with congressional intent when drafting the Corporate 
Transparency Act. This criticism has come from across the political 
spectrum and from the financial services industry, among others.

  --Can you give me your commitment that you will work with me to 
        resolve these concerns?
  --Will you ensure that FinCEN works with stakeholders and takes into 
        account the concerns raised by Congress, so they are faithful 
        to Congressional intent?

    Answer. Yes. FinCEN appreciates all the comments submitted in 
response to the beneficial ownership information access notice of 
proposed rulemaking. In total, FinCEN received more than 80 comments on 
the proposed rule and is carefully reviewing them. FinCEN is 
considering the concerns raised in the comments and intends to remain 
faithful to Congressional intent. FinCEN's priority is to implement a 
highly useful beneficial ownership reporting regime, while minimizing 
burden on reporting companies (particularly small businesses) and 
financial institutions, consistent with the Congressional intent set 
out in the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). Because FinCEN in engaged 
in an active rulemaking process, we are unable to comment further on 
any particular policy decision at this time.

    Question 2. Congress passed the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) in 
2020 to meet the goal of promoting financial transparency while 
eliminating duplicative reporting requirements and reducing unnecessary 
regulatory costs and burdens for financial institutions. As drafted, 
FinCEN's proposed rule creates a framework in which banks' access to 
the Registry will be so limited that it will effectively be useless, 
resulting in a dual reporting regime for both banks and small 
businesses.

  --Will you work to ensure that FinCEN rectifies the redundancies and 
        inefficiencies proposed under the current rule and establishes 
        a more efficient framework that will allow financial 
        institutions to fulfill regulatory requirements and better 
        support AML/CFT compliance?

    Answer. FinCEN's priority is to implement a highly useful 
beneficial ownership reporting regime, while minimizing burden on 
reporting companies (particularly small businesses) and financial 
institutions, as required by the CTA. FinCEN understands the concerns 
raised by commenters regarding access by financial institutions to 
beneficial ownership information, as well as concerns about the 
permitted uses of such information. FinCEN is reviewing comments to the 
beneficial ownership information (BOI) access notice of proposed 
rulemaking and is considering concerns raised by commenters as it works 
to finalize the rule. FinCEN is engaged in an active rulemaking 
process, so we are unable to comment on any particular policy decision 
at this point.
    FinCEN also expects that many issues raised by commenters will also 
be considered in the future revision of its Customer Due Diligence 
(CDD) Rule. The CTA requires FinCEN to revise the CDD Rule within 1 
year of the effective date of the final beneficial ownership 
information reporting rule. In revising the CDD Rule, the CTA directs 
FinCEN to reduce unnecessary or duplicative burdens on financial 
institutions and legal entity customers. FinCEN will consider revision 
of the CDD Rule through a future rulemaking process that will provide 
the public with an opportunity to comment on the proposal.

                          SUBCOMMITTEE RECESS

    Senator Manchin. The subcommittee meeting will be adjourned 
on that.
    Secretary Yellen. Thank you.
    Senator Manchin. Thank you.
    [Whereupon, at 4:19 p.m., Wednesday, March 22, the 
subcommittee was recessed, to reconvene subject to the call of 
the Chair.]
