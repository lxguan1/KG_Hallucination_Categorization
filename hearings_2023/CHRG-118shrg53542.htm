                        Friday, August 18, 2023

                      United States Senate,
                        Committee on Small Business
                                      and Entrepreneurship,
                                                          Hilo, HI.
    The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:30 a.m. HST, in 
University of Hawaii at Hilo, Haleolelo Lumi Pahiahia, 113 
Nowelo Street, Hilo, Hawaii, Hon. Mazie Hirono presiding.
    Present: Senator Hirono [presiding], and Representative 
Tokuda.

              OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HIRONO

    Senator Hirono. This hearing of the Senate Small Business 
committee will come to order. Good morning and thank you for 
joining us at today's field hearing, as I mentioned, of the 
Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.
    I thank our witnesses for being here today, and everyone 
who made this hearing possible, including the University of 
Hawaii at Hilo College of Hawaiian Language, which is hosting 
us here.
    I would like to begin by acknowledging the tragedy that 
continues to unfold on Maui, as well as the fires here on 
Hawaii Island. In the last week, we have all witnessed 
wildfires tear through our communities on these islands, 
devastating businesses and homes, displacing residents and 
visitors, causing injury, and claiming lives.
    Those who have lost their lives remain in our thoughts, as 
do their loved ones. While the devastation is on an 
unimaginable scale, these communities are resilient, and we 
will rebuild together. That rebuilding will take time. As we 
begin this long process, we must do so with an eye toward 
resiliency and sustainability.
    We need to make sure other communities in Hawaii and across 
our country are taking steps to mitigate the risks of fires and 
other natural disasters. And we are seeing many more natural 
disasters--the frequency and the harm of these natural 
disasters or events that we are seeing, as I said, more and 
more.
    One of the most important lessons we can learn from the 
tragedy that we are experiencing is the importance of active 
management of our lands and agriculture. Farms and Ag producers 
have long played a vital role in our State, not only feeding 
our communities, but also managing and caring for our land. It 
is critical that they have the support they need to prosper 
across our State.
    During today's hearing, we will hear about Federal programs 
that are available to support Hawaii's communities and 
businesses, including farm businesses recover from the 
devastation we have witnessed over the past week. Already, the 
Small Business Administration has unlocked financial assistance 
for businesses and individuals impacted by these fires.
    Additionally, Federal agencies from FEMA to the USDA have 
provided human, financial, and other assistance to support our 
recovery efforts. And just days ago, I welcomed SBA 
Administrator Guzman to Maui to witness firsthand the 
destruction, and I am grateful for her support and the support 
of the SBA.
    According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, the 
SBA, there are more than 140,000 small businesses in Hawaii. 
And Administrator Guzman mentioned to me there are some 700 
small businesses in Lahaina. These small businesses employ over 
270,000 workers and make up more than 99 percent of all small 
businesses in our State.
    Of these, more than 2,000 small businesses are in 
agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting. Many of these 
businesses have been significantly impacted in the past days. 
As Congress prepares to consider the once every five years Farm 
Bill, I want to ensure we are considering the needs of these 
businesses.
    Supporting farm businesses is critical to our economy, our 
land, and the sustainability of our communities moving forward. 
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about what 
the Federal Government and other organizations on the ground 
are doing to support our communities, and what more we can do 
in the months and years ahead.
    And now I am glad that we are joined today by 
Representative Jill Tokuda. And for her opening remarks, 
Congresswoman Tokuda.

               STATEMENT OF CONGRESSWOMAN TOKUDA

    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you, Senator. First of all, I would just 
like to express my sincere gratitude to Senator Hirono and the 
Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship committee for 
hosting today's field hearing.
    I appreciate this opportunity to also sit side by side, 
listen to the testimony, ask questions, and engage and 
participate in what will be a very important discussion on 
promoting resiliency among Hawaii's farm business and our 
agriculture industry.
    As a member of the House Agriculture committee in Congress, 
I am advocating for policies in this year's Farm Bill that 
reflect the needs of our farmers, ranchers, and producers, the 
struggles they have, but more importantly, the hope and the 
opportunity that they see, as agriculture is a thriving part of 
an economy going forward here in our islands.
    You know, there is a lot I wanted to say before this 
hearing started. When we were thinking about this weeks ago, 
and as Senator Hirono so eloquently said, so much has happened 
in the last week that really shifted all of our thoughts and 
our minds, and where our hearts are at this very moment.
    What I can say is, though, we have experienced devastation 
here in Hawaii before. Agriculture is no stranger to this as 
well. If you think of the way of sugar and pine, we know that 
at the end of the day we must stick together, pull together to 
be resilient, to overcome, and provide for our families and for 
our communities.
    Right now, going through the State, talking about the Farm 
Bill over the last so many months, I have heard from farmers, 
ranchers, and producers of the struggles they have had to be 
able to manage what is a small business--but big business to 
them.
    But what their hopes are is that we can continue to have 
agriculture thriving here for generations and generations to 
come. Focusing on this resiliency that we have had historically 
with agriculture----
    [Technical problems.]
    Ms. Tokuda. Even the mic agrees. This is a very important 
topic, worthy of amplification. But knowing the struggles that 
we have been through, through agriculture, I think there is 
much that we can learn together in terms of where we must go 
heading into the future.
    To all of the members of the panel today, thank you for 
being here to express your--both your support, your guidance, 
and your insight in terms of where we can go. You know, Ag must 
continue to be part of the equation when it comes to a 
resilient economy for Hawaii.
    And while most of our agriculture farmers, and ranchers, 
and producers are small, it is, as I said, big business for us 
here in Hawaii.
    So, mahalo, again for being here today, and I look forward 
to the engagement and discussion.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Congresswoman Tokuda. Today's 
hearing will feature two panels of witnesses. Panel one will 
feature Federal and State witnesses who have experience working 
on programs that support businesses, including farm businesses.
    These witnesses have a detailed knowledge of these programs 
and will be able to answer questions about how the programs 
work, and the impact they have on businesses. Our panels 
include Chris Kanazawa from USDA, Sharon Hurd from the Hawaii 
Department of Agriculture, and Dilawar Syed, Deputy 
Administrator of the Small Business Administration.
    Thank you all for being here. I should also note that Mr. 
Syed, our recently confirmed Deputy Administrator of the SBA, 
traveled all the way from Washington, D.C. to be here with us 
today, so a special mahalo to you, Administrator Syed.
    And with that, we will now hear from our witnesses, 
starting from you, Mr. Syed.

  STATEMENT OF DILAWAR SYED, DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. SMALL 
           BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, WASHINGTON, D.C.

    Mr. Syed. Aloha. Thank you, Senator Hirono, for holding 
this hearing. Let me start by offering my deepest--my deepest 
condolences to all those who have lost loved ones. You know, so 
many precious lives lost. It is unimaginable.
    The pictures just keep getting worse and worse. Our hearts 
are heavy, but I want you to know, Senator and Congresswoman, 
and members of the community, that we are absolutely committed, 
committed to supporting the people of Maui for as long as it 
takes, because we know, as you mentioned, this is going to be a 
long, long, sustained recovery. SBA Administrator Guzman was on 
the ground last weekend with FEMA Administrator Criswell to 
survey the damage, and they joined you.
    And since my arrival in the State early this week, I have 
spent time with their teams to ensure that our plans, SBA's 
plans, are adequate to meet this daunting challenge, and I will 
continue to do so.
    As a frontline disaster relief agency, SBA is providing low 
interest loans to affected residents, businesses, and non-
profits in Maui. We have already accepted hundreds of 
applications, loan applications, and approved--I am happy to 
report, that we have approved the first set of home loans over 
the last couple of days.
    SBA staff is on the ground. As of last night, we had 34 
folks fully focused and dedicated to the disaster recovery. 29 
are actually in Maui, but 4 of them are in Honolulu helping 
coordinate the effort. And we opened a business recovery center 
in Maui on Wednesday.
    If you are watching or later on if you see this, if you are 
affected and you want to apply for an assistance, the fastest 
way to do that is to register through disasterassistance.gov. 
You can also apply through FEMA's mobile app for assistance or 
by calling FEMA hotline at 1-800-621-3362.
    Now turning to the subject of today's hearing, it is an 
honor to be here as the Deputy Administrator of the SBA. 
Because of supporters like yourself and your leadership, 
Senator Hirono, I am honored to have been confirmed by the U.S. 
Senate in a bipartisan word, and very proud to be serving our 
nation's 33 million small businesses.
    And let me say this, the tragedies that we have seen here 
that have befallen on this State is one of the reasons why this 
is such a privilege to serve and help these communities 
recover. I want to thank you for inviting me to talk about our 
work to support small businesses in Hawaii and help them 
realize their entrepreneur dream.
    Now, the SBA district office in Hawaii serves the largest 
geographic region of any district in the nation, Senator. They 
not only serve Hawaii, but also Guam, the Northern Mariana 
Islands, and other U.S. territories. Hawaii, just like the rest 
of the United States, is experiencing a record boom in new 
small businesses applications.
    From 2021 to 2022, nearly 38,000 Hawaiians filed 
applications to start a small business. That is, for context, 
63 percent higher than the rate we saw before the pandemic. 
Last year, when it comes to capital access at core programs, 
SBA approved more than $19 million in 7(a) loans and almost 
similar amount, $19 plus million in 504 loans to Hawaiian owned 
businesses. In 2023 so far, we are actually tracking higher 
when it comes to loan volume.
    And to date, we have approved 115 small businesses for 7(a) 
loans worth $41 million. Another very important way we help 
small businesses is by plugging them into SBA services through 
our resource partner network.
    In Hilo, we have our Hawaii Small Business Drop in Center 
that provides in-person services to business owners on the Big 
Island. Last year, the overall SBDC network in Hawaii served 
more than 1,250 clients, helped 67 new businesses get started, 
and supported more than 3,300 local jobs.
    I want to highlight one of these success stories in Hilo. 
Emily Taaroa was born in the Big Island and studied agriculture 
at the University of Hawaii. She and her husband started 
Punachicks. Many of you may be familiar with the business. It 
is an organic chicken farm. Today, their operation encompasses 
more than 25 acres, and their chicken is sold all across the 
State.
    And this business benefited from resources available 
through SBA resource partner. But we also want to acknowledge 
that there are many agriculture businesses that don't have 
access to those resources, that we have got to reach to them.
    And yesterday we met a number of coffee growers in Kona 
Center who clearly could use our assistance as well, especially 
when it comes to exporting. We know that only 11 percent of 
agri-businesses in Hawaii export internationally, and we want 
to change that.
    SBA Office of International Trade helps businesses access 
the capital necessary to enter foreign markets. We also provide 
grants to State organizations to help small businesses export 
through the State trade expansion program, or STEP.
    Since 2018, Hawaii has received $2.6 million in STEP 
grants, which has led to $5.8 million in exports. As the 
Administrator and I travel across the country, the number one 
challenge we hear from small businesses is about access to 
capital. And especially when it comes to small dollar lending, 
Senator, especially under $150,000, that has dried out and it 
has gone down significantly over the past decade.
    So, to address this gap, SBA has unveiled two very 
important new rules this year to reduce the unnecessary burden 
that prevents some lenders from participating in our programs. 
Based on feedback we see from our lending partners, we have 
simplified the process for lenders to make an SBA loan.
    We also are working to drive more competition in the 
marketplace so that business owners in Hawaii have more options 
to secure financing that is backed by SBA. We removed an 
outdated moratorium on small business lending companies, SBLCs, 
which will expand access to capital in the underserved market. 
And let me underscore that point, that moratorium on SBLCs had 
been in place since President Reagan's Administration.
    For 41 years, we could only support 14 SBLCs in our entire 
union. And now, thanks to the lifting of the moratorium, we 
have the opportunity to open three more SBLCs that will serve 
communities such as Hawaii. Again, Senator, thank you so much 
for the opportunity to be here and look forward to your 
questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Syed follows:]

    Senator Hirono. Thank you very much. Now we are going to 
hear from Chris Kanazawa, who is the State Director for Hawaii 
and Western Pacific Rural Development, USDA. And this is your 
second iteration, right, in this position.
    So, I am really glad that we have someone who is already 
familiar with many of the issues that come to you, and I have 
known Chris for a long time, and he is a can-do guy, and that 
is the kind of person--as is Administrator Syed, by the way.
    We want only can do people to come and talk with us about 
how we can support our businesses, especially in the Ag sector. 
So, Chris, please.

  STATEMENT OF CHRIS KANAZAWA, STATE DIRECTOR FOR HAWAII AND 
     WESTERN PACIFIC RURAL DEVELOPMENT, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF 
                 AGRICULTURE, HONOLULU, HAWAII

    Mr. Kanazawa. Aloha. Thank you, Senator Hirono, 
Congresswoman Tokuda for the opportunity to speak before the 
Senate committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship to 
share the role of the United States Department of Agriculture's 
role--mission area, how it plays in advancing prosperity for 
farmers and ranchers, as well as always, rural communities. I 
am Chris Kanazawa, Hawaii State Director for USDA Rural 
Development.
    My area of responsibility covers the State of Hawaii, the 
U.S. territories of Guam and American Samoa, the U.S. 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and three freely 
associate States of the Republic of Marshall Islands, the 
Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau. 
Hawaii Rural Development has five offices in the Hawaiian 
Islands of Maui, Kauai, Molokai, and here on the Big Island of 
Hawaii.
    On behalf of the USDA Rural Development, I would like to 
offer my heartfelt condolences to those who have lost loved 
ones in the wildfires in Maui. My mother was from Maui, and so 
I have much aloha for the island and the community. It is 
impossible to measure the devastation that these wildfires have 
brought to Hawaii and Maui when you consider all the lives that 
have been lost and upended.
    For as long as it takes, the Biden-Harris Administration 
and USDA will deploy every resource at our disposal to help the 
families and communities rebuild their lives and homes. We are 
thankful that all of our employees and families are safe.
    However, Maui is a small community, and we all know someone 
who has been affected by the wildfire. Our employees grieve for 
the community of Lahaina, just as all of Hawaii grieves. The 
loss of a historic community with rich culture, while tragic, 
cannot compare to the devastating emotion felt by our employees 
and all the people of Hawaii.
    Rule development continues to be strong and is already 
working to utilize resources at our disposal to help displaced 
communities. Rural development programs, while not designed as 
emergency response programs, will help rebuild the quality of 
life and increase economic opportunities for the community with 
financial assistance for housing, small businesses, farms and 
ranches, health, education, and social community facilities, 
infrastructure, and utilities.
    I have submitted written testimony that provides more 
detail on Rural Development's ongoing programs that support 
small businesses and agriculture producers, and I am happy to 
follow up on any questions you may have. But I would like to 
spend my time with you today to talk about the Rural 
Development is doing--what Rural Development is doing as it 
relates to the current disaster efforts.
    We are reaching out to all of our housing borrowers 
affected by the wildfires with we care letters, offering claims 
and payment assistance packages. Rural Development has 
increased its housing repair grants from $30,000 to $40,000, 
and waiving age requirements.
    We are taking inventory of vacancies in Rural Development's 
multifamily housing projects that may be used to offer 
temporary housing for displaced residents. Rural Development 
also has emergency and intermittent--and imminent community 
water assistance grants that are available to help communities 
prepare and recover from an emergency that threatens the 
availability of safe, reliable drinking water. Rule Development 
is the long term rebuilding partner.
    We are here for the duration and standby ready to support 
our rural communities. Rural Development programs will play a 
key role in rebuilding the devastated communities from the 
ground up. Rural Development's rural housing services will 
provide financial assistance for affordable housing and 
community facilities, for medical, education, social, and 
public service needs.
    The Rural Business and Cooperative Services will assist 
small rural businesses for facilities and equipment, technical 
assistance, energy efficiency systems and improvements, and 
working capital. And the Rural Utilities will finance basic 
water and wastewater infrastructure, telecommunication, high 
speed internet, broadband, and electrical infrastructure.
    This committee, and the agencies on this panel, have the 
greatest opportunity to support these businesses to rebuild and 
reopen, and Rural Development and USDA are prepared to stand by 
and help.
    Mahalo, Senator Hirono, Congresswoman Tokuda for this 
opportunity to share with the committee, USDA Rural 
Development's activities in supporting small businesses, 
agriculture, and rural communities.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Kanazawa follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Hirono. Thank you very much, Mr. Kanazawa. Sharon 
Hurd is the Director of the State Department of Agriculture.
    I know you have a lot of experience in supporting 
agriculture, but it remains a very challenging for us to really 
support Ag in the way that will contribute much more to our 
food sustainability.
    So, please go ahead with your testimony, Ms. Hurd.

  STATEMENT OF SHARON HURD, CHAIRPERSON, HAWAII DEPARTMENT OF 
                 AGRICULTURE, HONOLULU, HAWAII

    Ms. Hurd. Thank you, Senator Hirono, Representative Tokuda. 
With Maui at top of mind, with Hawaii Island top of mind, I am 
going to--I am honored and privileged to have this opportunity 
to speak on behalf of the Department of Agriculture.
    On my testimony, on behalf of the topic, promoting a 
resilient economy for Hawaii businesses, is basically going to 
be ways to improve and expand on the Federal programs that 
support Hawaii businesses in the agricultural sector.
    Our Congressional delegation does a fabulous job bringing 
us the kinds of grants that we need. They really do. If you--
grants.gov, you can see all the grants that they bring. But I 
am here to testify that the main challenges that Hawaii small 
farmers face in seeking Federal grants are, the first thing is 
that applying and administering the grants is really tough.
    It is very complex. You really need a simplicity HR, or 
some kind of a back room to help you with it, because it is 
complicated. The second thing that is difficult for small 
farmers to attach themselves to a Federal grant is that 
sometimes the concepts that the Federal grant supports, it is 
pretty, I am going to say, ivory tower and kind of a 
theoretical type concept.
    Sustainability, climate change, climate resiliency, 
cooperative interactions, all really important concepts, but to 
a small farmer, they don't find a way to attach themselves to 
that to secure the funding that they need.
    And the third thing that I am going to see is a challenge 
to the small farmers in accessing Federal grants, is that while 
they are doing that, there is actually a loss of productivity 
while executing the grant. In the 2017 Census of Agriculture, 
of the 7,328 farms in Hawaii, 78 percent of the farmers 
reported farm value sales of less than $25,000.
    So, 78 percent reports less than $25,000. Those are 
subsistence farmers or farmers that do farming on the side. We 
have to help these farmers scale up, provide them some sort of 
resources because they are ready. They are ready to bust out. 
They just need to know how to do that. 62 percent reported farm 
value sales of less than $10,000.
    And small family farms make up 91 percent of all the Hawaii 
farms. Many of the new farmers are immigrants from Southeast 
Asia or new farmers from the local population. So, while there 
are various solutions to these three barriers that I just 
mentioned--for instance, include funding in the grant to--for a 
service provider to help them actually administer the grant.
    Develop grant programs that focus on the farmer, how to 
support their operations, provide what they need, and meet the 
conceptual goals that the nation needs to meet. And then the 
third is to create outcomes and indicators that the small 
farmer find--sorry, create outcomes and indicators that the 
small farmer finds value, he can benefit from that, and 
continue to benefit from that.
    The outcomes and indicators need to be relevant to them. 
Okay, so what I want to say is those are good challenges, but 
what is going on today is really helpful. And what it is, is 
that recent Federal programs such as the Regional Food Business 
Center Program, Hawaii was awarded $30 million, UH. The 
Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure Program was a $3.2 
million award block grant. Partnerships for Climate Smart 
Commodities was $40 million.
    The reason I highlight these grants is because they are top 
down grants. They are large amounts of money, but they make--
they force the community to collaborate. Department is not 
competing with UH, is not competing with groups who are working 
together to come up with a program that is rich and robust, 
then we were able to help the farmer with their programs. If 
their farmers are not writing it, we are.
    These really robust grants are really good for the 
direction that we are going. I think it is wonderful. Programs, 
however--programs such as the specialty crop block grant 
program or micro grants for food security, they also are 
wonderful and really make a difference, are game changers for 
the small individual type farmers.
    So, the programs you are providing, excellent. I like to 
focus on the regional type partnerships as well as the 
individual farmers. And I think the pandemic has really focused 
this on resilience. And I think a lot of our programs today are 
focused on resilience.
    So, thank you for the opportunity. Waiting for the 
questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Hurd follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Hirono. Thank you. We will now move to 
approximately 20 minutes of questions from me and Congresswoman 
Tokuda.
    So, Ms. Hurd, since we heard from you last, you talked 
about a lot of Federal grants that are available. Are they--
first of all, are the grants applicable enough in terms of the 
criteria for small businesses, particularly farmers, to apply 
for these grants, or are there aspects to these grants that 
make it hard for our people to qualify?
    And also, if there is enough in grant funds that go to our 
farmers. And I think I heard you say that the 75 percent of our 
people in Ag what, make less than $25,000? So, are those some 
of the limitations in applying for Federal grants in the Ag 
sector?
    Ms. Hurd. I think what you are doing today is really----
    Senator Hirono. Can you get closer to your mic, please.
    Ms. Hurd. Yes, sure. I think what you are doing today is 
really good. You are actually targeting that group of people 
that are reporting income of less than--sales of less than 
$25,000, with grants like the current Resilient Food Systems 
Infrastructure grant.
    The one component in that grant that was really insightful 
was the equipment piece. You awarded between $10,000 and 
$100,000 to small businesses for equipment with no match.
    Now, that is a really impactful piece because if you are a 
food hub and all you need is additional refrigeration to take 
in food from an additional 20 farmers--refrigeration is 
expensive for a food hub, but with this $100,000 limit, they 
can go out and buy four different freezers and start really 
scaling up, and helping the farmer then, passing it on to the 
farmer to grow more and make more.
    So that is--that was good. As far as what you said earlier, 
do we need more money? Senator, the micro grants for food 
security was a wonderful grant. It was difficult to administer, 
but the amount of money, $5,000 made such a difference to the 
individual homeowner.
    Senator Hirono. And are those grants from USDA?
    Ms. Hurd. Yes, USDA AMS.
    Senator Hirono. So, I think that we need to recognize how 
important it is for flexibility for USDA. And Mr. Kanazawa, I 
visited with the largest food bank in Hawaii. And one of the 
most desirable things that their clients need are fresh fruits 
produce.
    They cannot use, as far as I understand, USDA money for 
those items that they--our food banks have to use private 
sources of funds to acquire the fresh produce. And we don't get 
enough of it, and this is something that I want to very much 
follow up with you that we don't get, I think, our share, 
Hawaii, our share of the kinds of this kind of produce that 
goes to other food banks in the rest of the country because of 
just distance, because of other limitations.
    And for Ms. Hurd, we would like our food banks to purchase 
food from our farmers, and right now they can't use Federal 
resources to do that. So somewhere along the way, we need to 
have these things come to, you know, a cooperation and to 
identify that this is an issue, and to work on it because this 
is another way that we can support Ag in Hawaii. And Ag in 
Hawaii needs a lot of support.
    And even the food banks being able to purchase our farmers 
produce, that would be, I think, a very positive step. So. Mr. 
Kanazawa, I would really like your assistance in figuring out 
this part of USDA's limitations.
    Mr. Syed, I know that SBA is one of the agencies in what we 
refer to as the, all of the family of State--Federal agencies 
that are present on Maui, and SBA is going to be a long term 
partner in our recovery.
    So how long will SBA be on Maui, can you tell us, in terms 
of helping the recovery efforts there, because there are some 
700 businesses, small businesses. I don't know whether they 
have already signed up. I mean, they are still going through a 
huge time of loss.
    So can you just talk a little bit about how your presence 
will continue on Maui, which is my hope and expectation.
    Mr. Syed. Absolutely, Senator. So, we were on the ground 
literally as soon as the disaster hit. And what I can assure 
you is that we will stay on the ground as long as it takes to 
support those who need us. Small business owners, as well as 
residents, because we also process home loans, as well as folks 
who have lost personal property, including cars.
    And you can see in pictures, virtually everyone lost their 
vehicle as well. So, in short, we are going to stay there, as 
the President said, follow the response, and SBA, I can speak 
on behalf of the SBA Administrator, that we will be on the 
ground for as long as it takes.
    Let me also share with you that when you look at what has 
happened in the country when it comes to fire disasters, 
Paradise, California, my home State, it was big news about a 
year ago, two years ago, devastation that we had never seen in 
the State. The city has yet to recover. This takes a long 
time----
    Senator Hirono. Yes.
    Mr. Syed. And this is even frankly, more challenging here. 
You know, we were talking with the disaster teams and normally 
they have been--experience with flooding and tornadoes, and 
often that, you know, folks that are stranded, they are helping 
them. And they go door to door, and there are no doors here, 
Senator. Like there is nothing in this community.
    So, the playbook is different. It is going to have to take 
us to stay there for a long haul, talk to resource partners, 
build relationships in the community. The community is 
dispersed all over the place.
    They have gone to the families. They have obviously, some 
of them are in shelters. So, we are going to have to put this 
for a very, very long time, and we are committed to doing that.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you. And when I mentioned the Federal 
family of agencies, I am talking about not only SBA, and I 
think the SBA has been there at every disaster and their long 
term commitment is very much appreciated. But the Federal 
family includes the Department of Defense, Energy, of course, 
USDA, EPA, DOT, Army Corps.
    So, this is what we refer to as a Federal family of 
agencies. And the continuity of effort will be very much 
required because the recovery of Maui, as well as on the Big 
Island, will take time and resources, and we need to have a 
continuing commitment.
    As we focus on the support for Ag, with especially as 
Congresswoman Tokuda is on the Ag committee and we are working 
on the five year new Farm Bill, it is going to be really 
important that that bill reflects a lot of support for the kind 
of agriculture that we have in Hawaii.
    We are not the commodity crops. We are specialty crops. 
Everything in Hawaii is considered specialty crops. And for too 
long, in my view, our Ag programs have supported the commodity 
crops. That would be cotton, soybeans, you know those are the 
big commodity crops and we do not have any of those.
    So, I want to make sure, working with Congresswoman Tokuda, 
that the next Farm Bill very much reflects the commitment to 
the small farmers that we have. Mr. Syed, you also referred to 
the coffee growers yesterday at Kona, and I think they said 
that they don't have that much familiarity with SBA and what 
programs SBA offers.
    So, what is the thing that you mention to them that you 
would be committed to doing in working with them?
    Mr. Syed. Absolutely. And well, actually, let me echo what 
you said. Hawaii is the only State in the union that produces 
coffee. And I think many of us are coffee drinkers and we 
should appreciate that. So, I hear you that there should be 
greater awareness of SBA resources to our agriculture 
businesses here, including coffee growers.
    So, what I proposed was that I want to lead a session, a 
virtual session, where we can expose our breadth of our 
services and programs to Kona based coffee growers so they know 
what are the various loan programs, other entrepreneurial 
programs, so they can benefit from. We have welcomed the new 
head of Rural Affairs.
    You know, Ania is here with me, and so she will help lead--
and I will personally be involved in that as well, to make sure 
that folks know what programs we have to support them.
    Senator Hirono. I am really glad that you heard from the 
coffee brewers directly, because one of the challenges that we 
always face is really the awareness of the people here, and I 
would say especially in the rural communities, awareness of the 
support they can get from Federal programs. So, they need to 
know about it. Outreach is really important and follow through. 
So, it was really great that you were there. Congresswoman 
Tokuda.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you. And I just wanted to reiterate as 
well, Senator Hirono did mention our desire to be able to 
purchase more food for our food banks from our local producers.
    She and I are actually leading up the effort to really make 
sure in the 2023 Farm Bill that we have the TEFAP direct 
purchase go through, so noncontiguous States like ourselves can 
really make sure we can do direct purchasing and we can 
purchase right from our farmers and get nutritious food into--
to our people, onto their tables. So really appreciate her 
leadership on this particular effort and working with me on 
this.
    Mr. Syed, you know, I want to take it from two approaches, 
one, the lender's perspective, and one, the applicant's 
perspective. So, I wanted to start with the applicant's 
perspective, which I think is important. You mentioned a 
decline in small dollar lending that we have seen likely 
primarily among the 7(a) small loan programs, so $150,000 or 
less.
    Is SBA able to offer technical assistance, and for us here 
in Hawaii, language access for those individuals that really 
need it to make these loans more accessible for people? Can we 
look at even more streamlining and simplicity because of the 
disastrous situation that we are in?
    And I know collateral requirements are still in existence 
for loans of $50,000 to $150,000. Is there some consideration 
to maybe removing some of those collateral requirements? And as 
you look at Lahaina, going up to $500,000, we are going to see 
significant loans needed given the scale of the damage.
    Can we also consider some additional easing back of the 
collateral requirements, given the kind of money that is going 
to be required of people who right now have nothing?
    Mr. Syed. Absolutely. So, it is two very important points 
that while we are on the ground, we want to make sure we assist 
applicants who, by the way, are traumatized right now as we 
speak, assessing what all they have lost, which is virtually 
everything and what their decisions are about rebuilding their 
lives and businesses.
    And when I was looking at the data, there is a significant, 
you know, minority population, obviously, the Vietnamese 
communities, the Filipino community, native Hawaiian 
population, and we are looking at what language assistance we 
can provide.
    I was talking to our Lieutenant Governor Luke the other day 
when we were at the food bank, and she made a very good point, 
and she said, while some of the folks may be language wise 
okay, but when it comes to filling an application of this 
nature, it gets pretty technical, and you want to provide that 
support.
    So, we will bring in language resources to that and to make 
sure that there is no friction in the process of them filling 
out forms. With respect to collateral, my understanding is that 
collateral is not a requirement, but we do ask folks, in the 
current process to actually, if the ability to have collateral 
in there.
    We will explore what is possible here, again, to take those 
burdens off, given that folks have lost everything. There is 
no--in many cases, perhaps there is no collateral to be even 
provided, and we have to see that. We have to be empathetic to 
that. So, we will look what we can do there, what the rules 
there are, and if we need to also make some changes----
    Ms. Tokuda. Very much appreciate that. Yes, and maybe 
looking now at the lenders portion, you mentioned in your 
testimony that earlier this year, you took steps to simplify 
and streamline the process, so we have more lenders, more 
competitions.
    Just given where we are right now in a disaster situation, 
we need to increase the amount of lenders and competition. Is 
there anything more we can do to remove additional complexities 
to the program so we can get people timely access to the funds 
that they need?
    Mr. Syed. So, I think the pandemic, you know, taught us 
this lesson that you had--it was really community banks and 
CDFIs, local banks that actually reached underserved, that 
reached black owned businesses, brown owned businesses. The big 
banks did not do that. And here again, we have a similar 
situation.
    And that is precisely why, Congresswoman, we have been 
making these steps, realizing that we are going to see more 
instances of these disasters in the face of climate change, and 
we want to make lending more available at folks' doorstep.
    So, what we are hoping is that when it comes to Community 
Advantage Program that we do have, which we didn't talk about 
in my testimony, that there are--my understanding is there are 
lenders from Hawaii who are applying. I hope it will encourage 
more lenders to apply.
    And if they of course, if they go through the process, that 
they could be one of the--one of the sources of capital that is 
backed by--supported by SBA that can be made available in the 
community.
    What we have to recognize is, I think you all have said 
this, this is not a one-week, two-weeks, one-month, two-month, 
six-month, one-year problem. This is a multi-year problem. Even 
if some of those banks are not, let's say, available today, and 
even if they come online, let's say, in a year from now, they 
would still add a ton of value because there is so much that 
has to be built. We are literally in a war zone like situation, 
and everything has been raised to ground.
    So, the good news is that we are--our reforms have created 
an environment where we are welcoming these local banks now, 
learning from the pandemic lessons, and thanks to the 
Administrator's very strong leadership.
    And we want to invite non-local banks institution to apply 
so they can be in the communities offering these loan products 
backed by SBA.
    Ms. Tokuda. We definitely would love to see more local 
participation----
    Mr. Syed. Absolutely.
    Ms. Tokuda. They understand our community and are very 
sensitive to where everyone is at right now. I would also 
encourage--I am heartened to hear that you will be leading a 
virtual session for more of our producers.
    I would encourage as well, if it is possible to do some in-
person throughout our islands. Broadband access is sometimes 
difficult for, you know, some of our communities, and even 
having the time to log on to a virtual session can be 
difficult. So, I am sure working with our offices, if we can 
take it to the people, I think that would be outstanding as 
well. And language truly is an issue.
    This county is the most populated with non-English speakers 
in the entire State. So, it is not just Tagalog or Spanish, it 
is Ilocano, it is many of our, you know, different languages as 
well. So, you know, please top us to assist in this particular 
process. Mr. Kanazawa, I just have one quick question.
    You really covered a lot of good things. Now, in terms of 
the Value Added Producers Grant, this is long term really that 
we are looking at--in order for people to rebuild and to 
continue to sustain and build their operations throughout our 
State, we know that they need processing facilities, they need 
access to things that will allow them to create value added 
products.
    Now, it is hard for a producer to do one by one. Have you 
been looking at funding, perhaps co-op type of opportunities 
for a number of different growers or producers in a region 
line?
    Lahaina could actually be one of these particular areas 
where, whether it is commercial kitchens or processing 
facilities, being able to access this is something they can 
afford to do on their own, but as a group it might really 
propel an industry forward and support numbers of different 
applicants.
    Mr. Kanazawa. Yes. I totally agree. Given the size of our 
farms, our small farms, it is important to ensure that there is 
some industry infrastructure that is available. And so Rural 
Development does have funding for food hubs, innovation centers 
that will provide for centralized processing.
    So, we do provide that broad regional infrastructure. In 
addition to that, though, specific to, as you mentioned, the 
Value Added Producers Grant, we are--Rural Development provides 
funding to help the profitability of our farmers, whether it be 
through our Value Added Producers Grant, whether it be even our 
Rural Energy for America Program that lowers costs.
    As an example, here on the Big Island, there is a Hawaii 
Oulu producers cooperative that has used our Rural Energy for 
America Program Grant, and they have been in--and this 
cooperative is made up of over 100 small farms across four 
islands.
    They have been able to generate over 65--67 percent of 
their energy through a solar photovoltaic system, and they have 
been able to save over 84,000 kilowatt hours through this. So, 
all of this, what we look at in supporting our Ag community, is 
how do we find ways to improve their profitability.
    And so, through individual programs that help individual 
farms, as well as the regional infrastructure, Rural 
Development is prepared to support.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you. And Mr. Kanazawa, I would just ask, 
I know you eloquently stated the ways that you are supporting 
our community now, but if you can help provide our office with 
information how immediately you are providing relief to folks 
in Maui on housing, access to drinking water, and broadband.
    These are three critical areas to keep people safe and 
connected, which we are prioritizing right now. But we would 
love to go to continue to put that out towards the community, 
to let them know what you are doing. And we know in the long 
term, you are going to be a valuable asset to providing in 
these areas.
    Mr. Kanazawa. Yes.
    Ms. Tokuda. And Ms. Hurd, I would just state that I do 
know--I appreciate the comments of all the things that are 
needed from a technical assistance perspective, and the needs 
of farmers, and the grants that are available.
    I just commit to continuing to work with you to make sure 
we have the capacity to actually apply and execute these grants 
because we know that there is money out there, but these are 
very busy folks that are helping to feed everyone, and we need 
to make sure we have that technical assistance, the capacity to 
apply for the money they deserve. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you. And Congresswoman Tokuda, I am 
really glad you happened to mention the importance of food 
hubs. As it turned out, I visited the Malama Kauai food hub, 
and this is an actual building where the farmers, some small 
farmers who could never afford to have a building like this, 
where they can bring their produce process to value added, a 
certified kitchen, all of that, without some support.
    And I have provided $2.4 million in earmarks, so, for that. 
And so there are things that we can do along those lines. But I 
would say that food hubs are a really important way that we can 
support the small farmers in scaling up value added, all of 
that.
    I have one question more for Mr. Syed. Can you tell me 
whether the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision has 
impacted SBA's ability to target women and minorities in your 
programs?
    Mr. Syed. Senator, I am glad you asked the question. 
Obviously, we are tracking this. We are--we don't see an 
impact, or we have not seen any guidance made available. But I 
can also follow up with you to see whether something that I am 
not aware of that we are doing differently.
    Senator Hirono. I think to the extent that SBA programs 
target women for a particular kind of support, that--I think 
that is something that the SBA could have an impact. So, you 
know what, I just want everyone to know, the Supreme Court's 
decisions have an impact on a lot of different things that you 
may not think is being resolved or addressed by the Supreme 
Court.
    But this is one area that we are tracking because the Small 
Business committee spends quite a lot of time talking about and 
asking SBA whether they are meeting their target growth goals 
for supporting minority businesses and women owned businesses.
    With that, we are going to take a five minute recess for 
the second panel. I thank the first panel for your testimony. 
Mahalo.
    Mr. Syed. Mahalo.
    Senator Hirono. Five minute break.
    [Break.]
    Senator Hirono. The hearing will resume. We will now 
convene our second panel. Just to reiterate, in panel one, we 
heard from Federal and State witnesses who have experience 
working on programs that support businesses.
    And these witnesses shared their knowledge of the programs 
and answered questions about how the programs work. And, of 
course, there is always room for improvement. We thank them 
again for being here.
    In panel two, we will hear from private and academic 
witnesses who have firsthand experience working with businesses 
and who are familiar with the challenges they face. They 
include Mark Wright from the College of Tropical Agriculture 
and, what is it, Human Resources--sorry, CTAHR, Joe Burns from 
Hawaii Small Business Development Center, Randy Cabral from the 
Hawaii Farm Bill, and Murray Clay from the Ulupono Initiative, 
a nonprofit organization focused on locally produced food, 
renewable energy, and clean transportation.
    Thank you all for being here. So, with that, we will start 
with our first witness, Dr. Wright.

STATEMENT OF MARK WRIGHT, PROFESSOR AND EXTENSION ENTOMOLOGIST, 
COLLEGE OF TROPICAL AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN RESOURCES, UNIVERSITY 
              OF HAWAII AT MANOA, HONOLULU, HAWAII

    Dr. Wright. Good morning. Aloha. I am Mark Wright. I am 
speaking on behalf of Dr. Ania Wieczorek, our Interim Dean, who 
is just recovering from COVID. I am here to come and speak on 
her behalf. I am with the College of Tropical Agriculture, 
University of Hawaii at Manoa, statewide responsibilities for 
research extension and education in agriculture and a broad 
range of topics.
    With a funding college of the University of Hawaii, as you 
probably all know, we play a role in wide ranging 
transdisciplinary education, which provides extensive support 
in agriculture and natural resource management, including 
things like invasive species management and so on, which are 
fundamentally important, as we know, to the State.
    During the past few years, our college underwent a 
strategic positioning effort, during the whole pandemic in 
fact, during which we collected data from more than 5,000 
individuals regarding requirements of various stakeholders in 
the State.
    And the result was a strategic document outlining four main 
initiatives. Among those was enhancing economic development for 
an adaptable and resilient community and well-trained 
workforce.
    And among this economic development was one of the main 
initiatives. One of the big things that came up was the needs 
of small agricultural operations that require access to free 
resources for education and training to strengthen their well-
being and their ability to contribute to economic development 
and the people of Hawaii.
    We need to be proactive in making locally produced food 
widely available to our population and a vibrant tropical 
agriculture of value added products to global communities, 
particularly in the State vulnerable to natural and human 
disasters, as we have seen recently, that can certainly have 
significant negative impacts on our food and food security and 
economy.
    I will give you a few examples of impacts that the College 
of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources have and continue 
to have. We are particularly active in the area of biosecurity 
and food security, particularly the management of invasive 
species. Insects and disease pests caused 20 to 100 percent 
crop losses in many cases, as I mean, I am sure you have seen 
as you have been traveling around.
    We have entomologists and plant pathologists to work on 
managing these problems, developing environmentally friendly 
options for managing these pests. Some examples of the recent 
development of integrated pest management for coffee berry 
borer, a severe pest of coffee, which has saved approximately 
$132 million for that industry in terms of pest management 
alone.
    We work in other crops such as macadamia nuts, papaya, 
vegetable crops, the whole range. Turf and landscape pest 
management is another huge issue. You are probably aware of the 
issues we are having on Oahu and now Kauai with coconut 
rhinoceros beetle which decimates coconut palms. CTAHR is also 
involved in food safety training.
    We have a program that has been able to train almost 560 
farmers recently in complying with food safety requirements. We 
work on culturally important staple foods and specialty crops, 
things like taro, ulu, and then floriculture as well, of 
course. We have a sustainable organic Ag program that 
contributes to training people in organic agriculture 
statewide, as well as contributing to workforce development.
    We have Hawaii-One-Ag Program, which focuses on students 
developing their education in terms of being able to work 
immediately in agriculture. Our GoFarm Program does a similar 
thing where we have immediate training for people who are 
interested in entering the agricultural sector.
    Natural resource and environmental management is another 
substantial component of what we do with people working on 
natural environment, working on invasive species management, 
fire management, and many other issues related to environmental 
management. Our college research addresses family and consumer 
issues.
    For example, healthy family development, the role of older 
people in society, providing environments that are healthy for 
young people, and developing a good economic sense and so 
forth.
    So, in summary, we require lots and lots of resources to be 
able to contribute to continuing to do these things and be an 
economic driver in the State. And I will stop there. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF JOSEPH BURNS, INTERIM STATE DIRECTOR, HAWAII SMALL 
         BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER, HONOLULU, HAWAII

    Mr. Burns. Thank you, and aloha, Senator Hirono. Aloha, 
Congresswoman Tokuda. Thank you very much for the invitation 
today to testify here, and also thank you very much for what 
you are doing for all the residents of Maui who are suffering 
terribly.
    So, the Hawaii SBDC is a program of the University of 
Hawaii at Hilo and is funded in part through a grant from the 
Small Business Administration. We opened in 1990 and have been 
hosted continuously since then by UH Hilo. We have five service 
centers statewide on the four major islands, and we are one of 
63 accredited SBDC programs across the country created by 
Congress in 1980.
    So, in the first two quarters of this year, we advised 945 
unique clients, and materially assisted with just under $20 
million in attributed capital acquisition. So, my comments 
today, I have three of them. First, I want to talk about 
Federal agencies which support Hawaii small agricultural 
businesses.
    So, I have three. The first one is obviously the USDA. And 
we work closely with the USDA, especially through two of their 
flagship guaranteed loan programs--one is the Community 
Facilities Guaranteed Loan Program, and the other is the 
Business and Industry Loan Guarantee Program. So, our role is 
to provide advisory services in terms of writing the required 
feasibility studies.
    And doing so, we contributed to the funding of agricultural 
and rural development projects for probably over the last 13 
years since I have been here at least. And so, I want to 
mention three examples.
    One is a coffee school with career and workforce 
development training on the cultivation, processing, roasting, 
and cupping of coffee. A cattle ranch refinance right here on 
the Big Island, lowering their financing expenses and 
supporting their expansion into the agritourism sector.
    And the third one is a rural, urgent care medical clinic on 
Kauai, which is not really an agricultural project per se, but 
the clinic helps to attract and retain rural residents such as 
farm owners, farm workers, by providing urgent medical care in 
the rural community that surrounds it. So that is USDA. Second 
one is the SBA, Small Business Administration.
    So, the Hawaii SBDC, as a resource partner of the SBA, 
provides export business advisory services to Hawaii businesses 
involved in the SBA State Trade Expansion Program, which Mr. 
Syed mentioned, the STEP Program, and that is administered 
through DBEDT at the State level in Hawaii. And we call it the 
``HiSTEP'' Program.
    So, we cover areas such as export planning, international 
market research, export financing, including the SBA's 
excellent guaranteed export finance programs. And the reason I 
mention that is because these services and export loans are 
very, very helpful for local, value added Ag product creators.
    Senator Hirono talked about commodities. We don't produce 
commodities, but we do produce specialty products. So, these 
would fit in that category. And then some examples of HiSTEP 
assistance that we provided to value added Ag businesses 
include a vertically integrated cocoa grower and craft 
chocolate manufacturer and exporter, a distiller of heirloom 
Hawaiian sugar cane varietals producing high quality rum, and a 
manufacturer of reusable cloth food reps using 100 percent 
Hawaiian beeswax.
    And then the third program we probably don't think about in 
terms of agriculture, but that is the Treasury Department's 
Small Business Credit Initiative, SBCI, which provides funding 
support for both equity and debt access to capital programs.
    And there is also a technical assistance element of the 
program under which the Hawaii SBDC will be receiving funding 
to provide businesses, financial literacy and management 
improvement services to socially and economically disadvantaged 
entrepreneurs and very small businesses outside of Oahu.
    So potential recipients of this technical assistance would 
tend to be farm and rural businesses just because of their 
location. My second comment relates to how to improve Federal 
programs that support agriculture and rural communities. One 
specific idea refers to the USDA Community Facilities 
Guaranteed Loan Program, which I mentioned.
    There is a requirement that under certain circumstances 
applicants must obtain the examination opinion of a CPA 
attesting to the validity of the assumptions in the financial 
feasibility report. In our experience, it has been very 
difficult to find those local CPAs who are willing and capable 
to do that examination opinion when it is required.
    So, then our applicants have to turn to the mainland CPA 
firms, which in our experience are very expensive and sometimes 
not willing to do it because they don't know Hawaii very well. 
And that creates a barrier to completing a potentially valuable 
project.
    So, I would just like to ask if there is not such a 
mechanism already, I wonder if the USDA would consider making 
available specific funding to facilitate that CPA examination 
opinion when it is required.
    And my last comment is, I would very much like to thank 
Senator Hirono for co-sponsoring the SBDC Improvement Act of 
2023, which reauthorizes the national SBDC Program, enhances 
its effectiveness.
    There are three provisions of the bill that I would like to 
highlight before I close. One is Section 2, which adds depth 
and detail to the existing mandated reporting to Congress with 
respect to the SBDC's annual entrepreneurial development 
activities. Section 3 allows SBDC to use a limited amount of 
SBA cooperative grant funding for marketing purposes. And 
Section 7 strengthens the protection of client confidentiality.
    So, in closing, may I say that we are grateful for the 
committee's continuing support of Federal programs which help 
to sustain agriculture and rural businesses in Hawaii for the 
accomplishment of the shared goals of reducing food insecurity, 
removing barriers to pursuing agriculture, and providing the 
capital and technical assistance necessary to foster a robust 
agricultural community. Thank you.

    Senator Hirono. Thank you. I just want to note that I think 
there is an echoing in here. It is a little bit hard for us to 
hear you all but speak into the mic.
    And apparently our mic is picking you up, but if you can, 
you speak very clearly into the mic. Randy Cabral, Hawaii Farm 
Bureau. You have vast years of experience in being an advocate 
for our farmers, so----
    Mr. Cabral. Unfortunately, five minutes, not going to be 
able to cover it.
    Senator Hirono. What was that?
    Mr. Cabral. Five minutes is not going to be able to cover a 
whole lot of stuff. [Laughter.]
    Senator Hirono. You have a lot to impart. Thank you. Please 
proceed.

   STATEMENT OF RANDY CABRAL, PRESIDENT, HAWAII FARM BUREAU, 
                        VOLCANO, HAWAII

    Mr. Cabral. Aloha, Senator Hirono, Congresswoman Tokuda. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony. My name is 
Randy Cabral. I am President of the Hawaii Farm Bureau. 
Organized in 1948, the Hawaii Farm Bureau is comprised of 1,800 
farm families members statewide, and we serve as Hawaii's voice 
of agriculture. The Farm Bureau is the biggest general 
agricultural organization in Hawaii.
    We represent our members' interest in public policy at a 
county, State, and national levels. We operate as a trade group 
for agriculture. The Hawaii Farm Bureau believes that if we 
want to focus on improving Hawaii's agriculture industry, we 
need to assist our farmers and ranchers by addressing the many 
challenges that they face, such as land use, access to 
affordable water, labor, transportation, invasive species, 
disaster preparedness, crop insurance, food safety, 
agricultural theft and vandalism, research and development, 
pesticide regulations, access to capital and marketing, just to 
name a few.
    I would like to take the time to discuss a few priority 
issues that we would like to see more Federal support for. 
Number one is invasive species have become one of the most 
challenging problems impacting Hawaii. Many invasive species 
are damaging Hawaii's environment and State's economy.
    Agriculture has a vested interest in this matter and is one 
of the major casualties when invasive species are introduced. 
Every year, numerous new pests are introduced into the State, 
such as the coqui frog, coffee berry borer, axes deer, 
macadamia felted coccid, little fire ant, coconut rhinoceros 
beetle, small hive beetle, varroa mite, two-lined spittlebug, 
just to name a few. We must do a better job of protecting 
Hawaii's agriculture industry's environment and the general 
public by preventing the introduction and establishment of 
harmful pests. Our port of entry biosecurity program is 
essential to prevent invasive species from entering the State. 
USDA inspect, check in, and carry-on luggage for outbound 
passengers from Hawaii.
    But there is no USDA inspection of luggage pre-entering 
into the State. The only barrier is the State Hawaii plant and 
animal declaration form that passengers fill out on the plane 
before arrival. It is essential that more effective measures be 
put in place and that Hawaii needs to have USDA help.
    Second item is farm labor. Shortage of agricultural labor 
has been an ongoing problem for years but has gotten worse. The 
shortage of willing and able workers, affordable housing for 
farm workers, and competition from alternate employment are 
several of the pressing farm related issues that need to be 
addressed.
    The H-2A program was created to fund--provide farmers with 
legal workforce to fill jobs on a seasonal basis when there is 
insufficient number of willing and available U.S. workers. An 
H-2A employer's labor costs frequently approach 40 percent or 
more of their total production cost. And for many of these 
producers, H-2A labor costs typically constitute 80 to 90 
percent of their total annual payroll.
    Many of Hawaii small producers simply cannot afford to 
participate in H-2A program. There is a need to be an 
alternative H-2A State programs that would work for the small 
producers. Transportation. Hawaii's position as the world's 
most isolated location, as well as being in a series of 
islands, presents major challenges to the State's agriculture 
industry.
    One of the barriers to expanding agriculture in Hawaii is 
the cost to transportation. Hawaii's farmers and ranchers rely 
heavily on air and ocean transportation to bring agricultural 
inputs such as equipment, feed, fuel, fertilizer, agriculture 
machinery for their production.
    Inter-island transportation has been a major issue with 
neighbor island farmers and ranchers. The majority of 
agricultural lands are on the neighbor island, yet the 
population center is on Oahu.
    Neighbor Island farmers and ranchers are disadvantaged when 
competing with fellow farmers and ranchers on Oahu due to the 
additional transportation cost of bringing in supplies and 
sending products out.
    Each increase in interisland shipping rates means increased 
cost to these farmers and ranchers, cost that usually cannot be 
passed on to the vendor. USDA FSA's Reimbursement 
Transportation Costs Payment Program provides some relief for 
the high cost of transportation but is currently nowhere near 
enough to support enough relief.
    We need the cap increase to recognize the transportation 
costs in Hawaii are expensive and necessary. While costs rise, 
the reimbursement program is capped at $8,000 per year. Renters 
spend hundreds of thousand dollars in ocean freight per year. 
For example, one rancher spent almost a quarter million dollars 
on transportation in 2022, but based on their reimbursement 
program, they got only $8,000, 3.6 percent of the cost.
    I guess with that, I will stop--thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Cabral follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Hirono. Thank you. Murray Clay from the Ulupono 
Initiative. So, you have been in--your organization has been an 
advocate for sustainable food, etcetera, etcetera, and you 
know, are we making improvements?
    Mr. Clay. We are. Do you want me to----
    Senator Hirono. Please, go ahead.

   STATEMENT OF MURRAY CLAY, PRESIDENT, ULUPONO INITIATIVE, 
                        HONOLULU, HAWAII

    Mr. Clay. Okay. Yes I have--so sounded like a question. So, 
aloha, Senator Hirono and Congresswoman Tokuda, and any members 
of the committee. Appreciate the opportunity to speak with you 
all today.
    The Ulupono Initiative is an impact investing firm, as you 
alluded to. We work across the State to try to increase local 
food production, renewable energy, clean transportation, and 
better management of our freshwater resources just to help 
Hawaii be more sustainable and resilient.
    So, we are talking today about the significance of Federal 
programs and how Federal dollars can be leveraged to support 
the food system and producers across the State. For the past 14 
years, Ulupono has worked and engaged with various sustainable 
projects in food to really try to increase that local food 
percentage in Hawaii. We provide financial and technical 
assistance.
    We partner with Government, profit, and nonprofit 
organizations, including many who have testified here today. So 
Federal funding resources do play a key role in ensuring our 
remote island State is able to increase its self-sufficiency, 
especially as we are highly dependent on imported food.
    During the COVID pandemic, Ulupono supported the 
agricultural industry by connecting Federal monies with local 
needs to support local farmers and ranchers who had lost many 
of their markets due to restaurant and hospitality industry 
closures.
    One particular example is the Farm to Foodbank Program, 
where Government, private, and philanthropic funds were 
leveraged to purchase locally grown food for food banks to 
distribute to those in need in our community.
    This did several things. It kept farmers afloat with a new 
market opportunity that they didn't have before. It supported 
local food banks who struggled to get the normal shelf, stable 
food that they would regularly carry. And it fed thousands 
within the community that were needy because they lost their 
jobs virtually overnight because of the shutdown of tourism.
    Our unemployment went from 2 percent to over 20 percent 
virtually overnight with the lockdowns. So, another way that 
Ulupono has supported the agricultural sector is by funding 
grant writers to help the local farmers and ranchers get those 
Federal program funds.
    The majority of Hawaii's producers, as was mentioned, I 
think by Director Hurd, are less than $25,000 a year in sales, 
and they operate on farms that are less than 10 acres in size. 
So, through many conversations with these stakeholders, we know 
that small farmers often don't have the time or resources to 
apply for those grants themselves.
    Having a dedicated resource to support them in doing so has 
been really instrumental. So, over the last 10 years, Ulupono 
has funded a number of grant writing programs, and the total 
cost of all those programs over 10 years was $1.5 million.
    Those grant writers over those same 10 years brought in 
$133 million of Federal funding. That is 88 times what it cost 
to fund the grant and loan writers. So, it is a huge leverage 
opportunity. In anticipation of the 2023 Farm Bill, we also 
engaged with stakeholders to help identify which Federal 
programs would be the most effective for helping producers here 
in Hawaii.
    And we collaborated with many of the folks that have 
testified here, including the USDA Rural Development, the 
Hawaii Farm Bureau, the Hawaii Department of Agriculture, and 
other smaller and statewide groups.
    So, of the 21 Federal programs that were identified as 
being useful, we narrowed it down to six priority programs. 
These are, the Reimbursement Costs Transportation Program, 
which addresses part of what Mr. Cabral was talking about, the 
Rural Energy for America program, the Specialty Crop Block 
Grant, the Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, the 
Livestock Forage Disaster Program, and the Micro Grants for 
Food Security Program, which were also mentioned today.
    So, for your consideration, you will find that our written 
testimony suggests that amendments for each of these programs, 
which we think will make it more effective for what producers 
are actually facing here in Hawaii. In light of what happened 
on Maui and Hawaii Island last week, these and future Federal 
programs will be especially critical to support the local 
agriculture industry and providing relief to local farmers, 
ranchers, and food producers as they recover from these 
devastating wildfires.
    It is worth exploring opportunities to make better use of 
the Ag land that we do have. Much of it, as we know, is fallow. 
Reuse water in the area to produce productive green firebreaks 
rather than just barren strips of land with no fuel. And 
increasing capacity around securing Federal funds that you, as 
our Congressional delegation, have helped make available.
    So, I do thank you for the opportunity to testify, and I am 
happy to take questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Clay follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Hirono. Thank you very much. We will now go to our 
20 minute questions. I am really fascinated by the way, Mr. 
Clay, that you have a grant writing program. And what are the--
what kind of people sign up for the kind of training that you 
provide to enable them to successfully receive grants? Just 
very briefly.
    Mr. Clay. Sure. So, we presently fund grant writer. Our 
longest funded grant writer is here on the Big Island at the 
Kohala Center. We also fund grant writers at OCA, which is more 
focused on Oahu.
    And then with the Farm Bureau that kind of works, of 
course, statewide. So those three grant writers work with their 
constituents in their geographic or across the State region to 
help them even know what they should be applying for and how to 
apply for it. Because without those skills, you are taking a 
very, very busy farmer and trying to get them to apply this 
very complicated thing.
    And it is all well intentioned, but they just don't know 
how to do it. And so rather than having those funds go to just 
those that have the best writing skills, they go to those where 
they have the greatest need and can impact our food sector the 
best.
    Senator Hirono. So clearly, there are a lot of grants that 
have been made available, by the way, through some of the 
really huge bills that have been enacted by Congress. So, the 
infrastructure bill, the COMPETES Act, the omnibus bill, and 
there is more money, for example, to fight climate change--some 
$300 billion.
    A lot of--there is substantial amounts in grants. And that 
is why what you are doing to train grant writing is really 
important, although part of it is that we could make the, say 
the application process more clear or shorter, whatever we need 
to do along those lines.
    Thank you very much. By the way, that you said that you 
identify six priority grants that really make a difference. Are 
all of these grants being reauthorized? Is there any danger of 
any of these grants ending?
    Mr. Clay. I am not certain about risk of them ending, but 
in our written testimony, we put in specific recommendations 
for awarding changes and requirement changes that would make it 
more beneficial to folks here in Hawaii based on our outreach 
to local folks, local farmers and ranchers here.
    Senator Hirono. Please let us know. And then we do have the 
Deputy Administrator of SBA, to the extent that SBA grants are 
very complicated. And in fact, there was a reference that, Mr. 
Burns, about the CPAs, having a hard time where--and they need 
to be certified.
    Whatever you were talking about, that makes it harder for 
our people to apply for these particular loans. Not sure, but 
we need to--if you can get with our Deputy Administrator on, 
maybe we make it easier for us to access the programs that we 
need. Mr. Cabral, can you explain how the management of 
rangelands on Hawaii Island helped with wildfire containment?
    Mr. Cabral. Yes, absolutely. I think most pastureland is 
well managed by the tenants or landowners through grazing. They 
make sure that they keep down invasive species, which has been 
a problem with the fires in Lahaina, overgrowth of guinea 
grass.
    You know, they have the resources and equipment necessary 
to control what they have growing on their particular parcels, 
and they can control the grazing so that you don't have this 
high fire load. I think that makes a big difference.
    Around the Lahaina, there was no control of the invasives 
and grasses around it, and that I think is a major factor in 
that fire.
    Senator Hirono. So, did these farmers work with any 
organization to alert them to what they could be doing to make 
sure that the wildfires are contained? Should that occur? I 
think there is a statewide organization, the Wildfire 
Management Group----
    Mr. Cabral. Yes, I think we have been----
    Senator Hirono. Have the farmers worked with----
    Mr. Cabral. We have participated in some of these wildlife 
management groups in the past. And so, it is something that I 
think we can be part of, and I think we would be more than 
happy to be part of that group to find solutions to the 
problem.
    Senator Hirono. There is an organization, I believe their 
name is the--I am looking at my staff because I meet with a lot 
of people. Yes, there we go, the Hawaii Wildfire Management 
Organization, and they have pretty much mapped the entire State 
as to wildfire vulnerabilities. And I think they also worked 
with your farmers and--on the Big Island to enable them to do 
what they needed to do.
    And I think that kind of awareness and cooperation is 
really going to be part of the lessons learned. And once again, 
for you, you mentioned that a top priority is invasive species. 
And that is something that Congresswoman Tokuda and I are going 
to continue to--she just joined the U.S. House, but I know she 
has an awareness of the need to continue funding research into 
combating invasive species.
    And you have indicated that is the number one priority that 
impacts our Ag community. And so, you know, I would appreciate 
any other kinds of requests that you would like to put to both 
me and Congresswoman Tokuda in how we can continue to combat 
invasive species.
    Mr. Cabral. I will tell you, Senator, under the past 
Administration, when Secretary Purdue was their head of 
Department of Agriculture, he came on a visit and I asked him 
point blank about helping with invasive species, that the USDA 
needs to do more.
    And his answer to me was, we do enough for Hawaii. I was 
floored by that response. Unacceptable, you know, as far as I 
am concerned. But that was the thinking back then. And I hope 
this Administration thinks differently and realizes that Hawaii 
is basically the invasive species capital of the world, I 
think. And we need--desperately need help.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you. I think that--you know, that is 
one of the things that I talk about a lot on the committees 
that I sit on. That for one thing, on the Energy committee, 
that focuses a lot on wildfires and to alert the committee 
members that Hawaii has its share of wildfires and the acreage 
burned is on a par with what happens on the mainland.
    And we don't have a Forest Service presence here as such, 
but we did meet with some Forest Service people. We do not have 
any national forests in Hawaii, and I am trying to bring that 
kind of a presence here.
    For--again, for Mr. Clay, how can ongoing efforts by 
Ulupono and other organizations to bolster our internal food 
supply chain and grow the volume of food we are producing in 
Hawaii help us better respond to disasters moving forward?
    Mr. Clay. So, I think we are all aware that we are, as was 
mentioned, the most isolated, populated landmass in the world. 
We are 85 to 90 percent dependent on imported food. We rely on 
just in time delivery of that food, and then not to mention 
tourism is our number one industry, which as we have seen, can 
go away virtually overnight.
    So, we are very, very vulnerable. I would say when it comes 
to food security, I would almost reclassify natural disasters 
in two different categories, when it comes to food security. 
One are disasters that impact our ability to import food.
    So, it doesn't matter whether it is a hurricane, a 
wildfire, a tsunami, that is one category. And that is mostly 
about damage to our ports and harbors that restricts our 
ability to import food. The worst possible situation would be 
damage to Honolulu Harbor and Honolulu International Airport 
because most of the large shipments of food come in via those 
ports.
    The other type, which is more like what we are seeing with 
some of the wildfires, not just on Maui but elsewhere, is 
damage to local infrastructure, which ironically makes it 
difficult to get both imported or local food in.
    Now, if you have the difficulty with imported food as we 
saw during the COVID pandemic, local food can step up and make 
a big difference. For example, when the slaughterhouses, the 
meatpacking plants in the mainland were being shut down almost 
across the nation because of COVID infections, it became very, 
very hard to find a lot of different meat products in the 
grocery stores, but across the entire COVID pandemic, Paniolo 
Cattle Company and Parker Ranch that we worked with did not 
miss a single delivery of local beef to the Safeway stores over 
that entire period of time. In fact, they increased production 
over that period of time.
    So local food can make a very big difference. But one of 
the other things that we got to remember is when these 
disasters happen, tourism often goes away with it. And when 
tourism goes away, the most lucrative market for farmers and 
ranchers, the restaurants and resorts, close down as well.
    So, we have to switch that funding, like we talked about 
before, as farm to food bank, so that the food banks that are 
having trouble getting food can buy directly from the farmers 
and ranchers because you have got farmers and ranchers that 
have food but no markets.
    You have got people out of work that need food but have no 
money, and you just put those two together and it can be really 
successful in growing. I would also point out that we are very 
focused on institutional purchasing efforts, including 
especially with the Hawaii State Department of Education and 
their legal requirement to get to 30 percent local food by 
2030. Right now, that number is a fairly abysmal, 6.2 percent 
according to the report.
    Farmers and ranchers will grow. They will expand, 
especially with Federal resources. But they are only going to 
do that if they think the State is really going to follow 
through on this and really increase local production.
    And reaching that goal of 30 percent would mean an extra 
$14 million of market for local farmers and ranchers. So, we 
are focused on the institutional side of that problem as well.
    Senator Hirono. I think that kind of focus effort to 
purchase local by the Department of Education, you know, is--I 
have been trying to get them to put fresh pineapple in our 
school lunches.
    And for a long time, all of our cafeterias are so used to 
just open up the canned pineapple, that when we finally got 
some fresh pineapple, people have to figure out how to cut the 
pineapple, if you can believe it. So, there are a lot of things 
we can do. And one of the other things mentioned was the need 
for workers. Mr. Cabral, that is a nationwide need for farm 
workers.
    And there is a lot more focus in the Judiciary committee 
even on the visas that will enable our farms to keep going. And 
so, you know, there is a lot of, you know, connection to the 
awareness of what we need to do, and especially after COVID.
    We have a lot of areas where we can--immigration reform 
needs to happen. All of that. And obviously I will talk with 
you, mister--I am sorry, regarding the CPA issue. My time is 
up, so I am going to go to Congresswoman Tokuda.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you. Really quickly, I will just 
piggyback then on Senator Hirono's last comment about the CPA 
examination opinion. I am just wondering, I know you are asking 
for more funding to provide support since people are having to 
seek out CPAs on the mainland, as well as it gets very costly.
    But is there any look at an alternative process to ensuring 
some of the financial validity without having to do the CPA 
examination opinion? It is very hard for folks, especially on 
the neighbor island, to be able to actually access this kind of 
professional service, and so, are you looking at an alternative 
process to the CPA examination opinion?
    Mr. Burns. Thank you for the question. So that is a 
requirement of the USDA. So, we don't have the ability to 
change that. So that is why I mentioned in this specific 
program, which is the community facilities program, that at a 
certain level, they do require that.
    So normally when we write the feasibility study, if it is 
at a certain level, that requirement is not necessary. But at a 
certain level it kicks in, and that is where we have 
encountered that difficulty. So, we don't have the ability to 
change that requirement. That is part of the USDA.
    Ms. Tokuda. USDA. Okay, so that is something we can discuss 
with the USDA about alternatives to even having this 
examination process, which is particularly onerous for our 
people.
    I just also did want to reiterate and confirm that I know 
SBA is opening a business recovery center, has already in Maui 
and Kihei, and you have SBDC representatives on site to assist 
with connecting people with resources. So, thank you for doing 
that. Just want to move over to Mr. Cabral.
    Randy, thank you so much for your advocacy and help. We 
could spend all day talking about the areas of knowledge that 
you have. In particular, I want to focus in on the disaster, 
you know, assistance programs that we have. I know even before 
the fire I spoke with farmers who have spoken about the fact 
that the disaster eligibility cycle is not meeting up with the 
demands we have to date.
    You know, for some of these programs, you can only apply 
twice in 10 years, and we know disaster is striking much more 
frequently because of climate change. And, you know, so we 
actually have been pushing some reforms in the Farm Bill to 
decrease that, you know, that time of period because people 
need to access funds when disaster strikes.
    And so, to the point of the disaster assistance programs of 
various ones, I know, Mr. Clay, you mentioned a number of those 
in your testimony. What are farmers finding prohibitive or 
challenging in terms of being able to apply for these disaster 
assistance programs? How can we reduce some of the barriers?
    What are they seeing they really need? Because whether it 
is a bridge washing out and they can't get their produce to 
market, whether it is something taking out entire crop, 
invasive species, axis deer, you name it.
    What can we do better when it comes to disaster awareness--
assistance programs, excuse me, that our farmers need to make 
it easier to draw down and apply for?
    Mr. Cabral. I know there is talk of like a small business 
or loans, right, low interest loans. But I think a lot of the 
farmers are already in debt. So, getting another loan is not 
going to help them.
    So, I think grants would be the preferred method for these 
farmers. And also, there are a lot of immigrant farmers, that 
there is this language barrier. They don't understand the 
programs.
    So, we need to have somewhere where they can go and get 
interpreters to help them process whatever it takes to be able 
to get help. So those are the kinds of stuff I think that could 
help.
    Ms. Tokuda. Absolutely. You know, are they also finding--at 
this point, grants definitely versus loans because they are 
already cash strapped, but are there other challenges you are 
seeing with some of these loans just in terms of whether it is 
the amount of money and resources we are able to support folks 
with, reimbursed folks with?
    You mentioned that with the RTCP program, the 
Transportation Reimbursement Cost Program is being helpful, but 
quite frankly, not enough to match the, you know, the costs and 
whatnot.
    So just giving us some insight in terms of where we need to 
beef up certain programs, whether it be grants, reimbursements, 
or loans, because farmers, quite frankly--it is becoming a make 
or break, whether you are part of the fire damage or not, to be 
able to survive.
    So, any thoughts on these--?
    Mr. Cabral. Yes, I mean, if you take the, for example, the 
ranchers that got impacted on Maui. They are going to need 
feed. But the cost of importing that feed is really hard for 
them to do. So, they need help in being able to get either 
reimbursement costs or grants to be able to import this feed 
for the cattle while they recover from that.
    And I think like some of the farmers lost their market in 
Lahaina, so they need help in finding new markets. And one way 
of helping them, we talked about the food basket, food banks. 
Purchasing local food.
    And by giving grants to the food basket, food bank, they 
can then purchase from these farmers and help them recover from 
that market. During the pandemic, we were able to get around 
three quarters of a million dollars from private resources, and 
we took that money and bought from struggling farmers and 
ranchers, and then gave it to the food basket on the Big 
Island.
    So, programs like that could really help.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you. I know those are very, very helpful 
for a lot of different people and for all of our farmers. I 
wanted to jump to Mr. Clay. You know, as Senator mentioned, you 
folks did some significant investments over the last decade in 
terms of supporting farmers and their efforts to draw down what 
is a very large amount of Federal grant money.
    So, there is money available on the table. Based upon what 
you have seen in terms of the technical assistance work that 
you have provided, what kind of changes and supports do we need 
to be providing to make it easier for farmers, ranchers, and 
producers to be able to take advantage of all the Federal funds 
that are available to start, sustain, grow, rebuild their 
businesses?
    We have talked a lot about language access. We have talked 
a lot about increase--you know, streamlining forms. But based 
upon your real life experience, really what do we need to do to 
connect farmers and producers with the money they so 
desperately need right now?
    Mr. Clay. So, to start, I am going to piggyback because it 
is relevant to something that Randy just said, which is 
translation services, essentially. So, I know we are here 
mostly talking about Federal programs, but just as an example.
    The city and county of Honolulu recently did a small grant 
program for $50,000 of grants to a whole bunch of farmers. And 
we worked with the Pacific Gateway Center to fund translation 
services. And I believe that because of that ability for them 
to understand and apply, I want to say three-quarters, but 
don't quote me on that, but it is definitely more than half of 
the winners of those grants speak English as a second language.
    So, if they can't access that, they can't understand it, 
they don't even know what they qualify for. Translation can be 
a big deal. Another one I would say is these grant writers, 
keep in mind that they are just gems. They are so valuable 
because they are not just taking farmers and ranchers that come 
to them and say, hey, I would like to apply for a value added 
producer's grant.
    They don't even know what is out there. They don't know 
what is available. And so, these people kind of counsel them on 
what grants are available and then help them with the 
application, sometimes with the business plan and some other 
things to get these monies in. So, I would say we have a kind 
of scarce resource here.
    There is only maybe a half dozen of those types of folks in 
Hawaii that I am aware of that are really good at pulling down 
that Federal funding, that know how to do it, and can counsel 
farmers and ranchers to know what to apply for and how to do 
it. And we have got to hold onto them.
    There is not many of them here in Hawaii. And training 
them, I think was mentioned, training more of such people would 
be a benefit as well.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you. You know, and I would--I know there 
has been a number of different panelists here and some of these 
questions I feel like are made for many of them.
    But just broadly, and Senator did touch upon this in terms 
of the role, and Randy, you talked about this too, the role 
agriculture and our Ag practices to play in climate change 
mitigation.
    I mean, for example, when we take a look at wildfires and 
brush fires, you know, are we maximizing our placement of 
farms, maybe targeting, you know, grazing lands, agroforestry 
techniques to really be able to slow down a lot of the fire 
that we are seeing.
    Obviously, invasive species, as Randy mentioned, plays a 
role in accelerating the impacts on our land as well, whether 
it be, you know, fallow lands, whether it be barren lands, all 
of these different things.
    We are, in fact, the invasive species capital of the world, 
as was mentioned. We are also the extinction capital of the 
world. Two very, you know, unfortunate things that we are known 
for. But sadly, when we do nothing in terms of resources and 
actually addressing this, it turns deadly.
    We can't feed ourselves, and you have wildfires like what 
we have just seen. So, there are real consequences and costs, 
life costs if we do not act quickly on managing our invasive 
species threat.
    So just wondering, I am speaking to CTAHR now, to Dr. 
Wright, is there anyone also working closely with our 
Department of Agriculture, with our Farm Bureau, our actual 
producers, to take a look at how we are studying this role of 
agriculture, how we need to be more proactive in terms of the 
use of our Ag lands, much of which are fallow, that now need to 
be productive, whether it be agroforestry, whether it be 
grazing lands, to really understand that we are dealing with 
climate chaos right now and we will continue to see more and 
more of these types of incidents, and we have an opportunity to 
preempt and prevent some of this using these particular 
techniques?
    Dr. Wright. Yes. So, we do have a program in the Department 
of Natural Resources and Environmental Management that 
considers wildfire prediction modeling and so on, and I think 
they are looking at the way land is used and the spillover 
effects of fallow lands with invasive species.
    And in general sort of since the college recognizes that 
invasive species is a major impact and that it results in these 
horrendous, disastrous events like wildfires and so on, so it 
is a big driver in the college. We are constrained by lack of 
resources such as quarantine facilities for biocontrol for 
invasive species, for example. And those are things we plan 
for. We have a number of groups of people that work in those 
areas. Does that answer your question?
    Ms. Tokuda. Well, I think it just points to the fact that 
we have a lot more work to do. And as is brought up in this 
hearing, while right now our only protection is a sheet where 
you check off a box when we have threats of invasive species, 
we have noxious weeds, we have guinea grass. We have so many 
things that are quick burns. We have to do more, or it will 
turn deadly for many of our communities. So, thank you, 
Senator.
    Mr. Cabral. Congressman, if I could make one comment. In 
Ag----
    Senator Hirono. Can you speak into the mic--?
    Mr. Cabral. We are not able to do a whole lot without 
water. Water is going to be the key to a lot of stuff that we 
need to do. And unfortunately, there is a lot of controversy 
over water.
    If you look at Lahaina and the controversy of taking that 
extra flow to fight fire versus the farmer, you know, that was 
an issue that I think played out across the islands. East Maui 
water system is so controversial, but we need to be able to 
share water.
    We need water development to make sure we can protect these 
areas, create green space. If we are going to put in 
agricultural crops, we need water, otherwise, we are not going 
to be able to do anything.
    Senator Hirono. Excuse me--thank you very much. As we focus 
on sustainability and resilience in our communities, 
agriculture has a very large role to play. And yes, agriculture 
faces many challenges.
    Part of what we do in Congress is, is to point out how 
unique Hawaii is, not the least of which that we are very 
isolated, the thousands of miles of ocean. That presents unique 
issues for us in terms of transportation and all kinds of other 
elements, invasive species that other States may not have--not 
faced quite to the extent that we do, and the need to research 
at CTAHR and other places for all of that.
    So, this is a hearing that brings together agencies from 
the Federal Government, as well as State and local advocacy 
groups, to bring to bear how important our focus is on food 
sustainability and resilience. And this is one of the ways that 
we can be much more focused and proactive in what we need to 
do. But it is a lot.
    And things like our ability to get grant money, if we don't 
apply successfully for those grants, we are leaving money on 
the table that can be brought to bear. So, it is a lot of 
organizations, Federal, State, and local coming together to 
address the issues that we face.
    And by the way, I am glad that the Pacific Gateway Center 
was mentioned because they are a group that provides language 
services, etcetera, and they enable a lot of immigrants who 
come to our State to succeed. And I know for a fact that they 
have enabled restaurants, for example, to get the kind of help 
that they need from Pacific Gateway Center. And one restaurant 
that we have been to is Istanbul, and they got their start at 
Pacific Gateway Center.
    So, there are organizations that not very many people here 
know about, but they are plugging away, just as all of us are 
and all of you are. Thank you very much for the two panels. And 
for the record, our committee will remain open for two weeks 
for questions for the record. And of course, we would ask the 
witnesses to respond promptly to those questions.
    And I want to thank Congresswoman Jill Tokuda for joining 
us, because she sits on the Agriculture committee and is going 
to be very focused on putting into the Farm Bill those kinds of 
provisions that will be very, very focused on what we need to 
be pushing for, for Hawaii.
    So, thank you, Jill, for being here. There being no further 
business, the committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:25 a.m. HST, the hearing was adjourned.]
