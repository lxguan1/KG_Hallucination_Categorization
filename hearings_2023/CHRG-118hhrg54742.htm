    SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

    TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Aviation
    FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Aviation
    RE:      LAviation Subcommittee Hearing on ``Turbulence 
Ahead: Consequences of Delaying a Long-Term FAA Bill''
_______________________________________________________________________


                               I. PURPOSE

    The Subcommittee on Aviation of the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure will meet on Thursday, 
November 30, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. ET in 2167 Rayburn House 
Office Building to receive testimony at a hearing entitled, 
``Turbulence Ahead: Consequences of Delaying a Long-Term FAA 
Bill.'' The hearing will focus on the need for Congress to pass 
a comprehensive long-term Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
reauthorization bill, the ramifications short-term extensions 
have on the agency's operations, and the subsequent effects on 
the aviation industry and the travelling public. The hearing 
will also provide an opportunity for Members to discuss key 
provisions of the House-passed FAA reauthorization bill--H.R. 
3935, the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American 
Aviation (SGLRAA) Act. The Subcommittee will receive testimony 
from the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA); the 
National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA); Portland 
International Jetport on behalf of the American Association of 
Airport Executives (AAAE); and the Transport Workers Union 
(TWU).

                             II. BACKGROUND

    The primary mission of the FAA is ensuring civil aviation 
safety.\1\ The FAA has the responsibility to certify, monitor, 
and regulate the safety and operations of the civil aviation 
sector, including airlines, general aviation, unmanned aircraft 
systems (UAS), airports, commercial space transportation, 
repair stations, and aircraft manufacturers, as well as 
establish licensing and training requirements for pilots and 
other aviation related professionals.\2\ Congress periodically 
reauthorizes the statutory authorities of the FAA and other 
Federal civil aviation programs, including the authority to 
collect aviation taxes which fund the Airport and Airway Trust 
Fund (AATF), by passing an FAA reauthorization bill. The last 
long-term FAA reauthorization bill, the FAA Reauthorization Act 
of 2018 (P.L. 115-254) (hereinafter referred to as the ``2018 
Act''), was passed by Congress and signed by the President on 
October 5, 2018, authorizing the FAA until October 1, 2023.\3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On June 9, 2023, Chairman Sam Graves and Ranking Member 
Rick Larsen, along with Subcommittee on Aviation Chairman 
Garret Graves and Ranking Member Steve Cohen, introduced the 
SGRLAA Act--a bill to reauthorize the FAA through Fiscal Year 
2028 with comprehensive policy solutions pertaining to all 
major sectors of aviation. The Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure (T&I Committee) marked up and approved the 
SGRLAA Act on June 14, 2023, by a recorded vote of 63-0 and the 
House passed the bill on July 20, 2023, by a recorded vote of 
351-69.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation (Commerce Committee), which has jurisdiction 
over the FAA, was scheduled to mark up its FAA reauthorization 
bill on June 15, 2023; however, the markup was immediately 
recessed, and the Commerce Committee has not reconvened to 
consider the bill. In the absence of passing and enacting a 
long-term FAA reauthorization bill before the 2018 Act expired, 
Congress enacted a clean three-month extension of the current 
FAA's authorities in the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2024 
and Other Extensions Act (P.L. 118-15) which was signed into 
law on September 30, 2023.\5\ Pursuant to the Fiscal Year 2024 
Continuing Resolution, the FAA's statutory authorities are now 
set to expire on December 31, 2023.

HOUSE PROCESS

    In anticipation of needing to reauthorize the FAA by 
September 30, 2023, T&I Committee leadership, under then 
Aviation Subcommittee Chair Larsen and Ranking Member Graves, 
jointly began soliciting priorities from the aviation community 
in the 117th Congress, so that the Committee could begin 
drafting an FAA reauthorization bill as soon as the 118th 
Congress commenced. Chairman Sam Graves renewed that call at 
the beginning of the 118th Congress.\6\ Chairman Graves 
publicly stated in January 2023, that the House planned to pass 
an FAA reauthorization by the beginning of July 2023.\7\

(public statement of Sam Graves, Chairman of H. Comm. on Transp. & 
Infrastructure).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In the Spring of 2023, the Committee also began soliciting 
input from Members to help inform the development of the bill, 
which included holding a Member Day in April 2023 where all 
Members of the House were invited to provide testimony to be 
considered before the bill's markup.\8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Committee received over 2,000 requests from Members and 
the aviation community for consideration. These requests formed 
the foundation of the SGRLAA Act and helped determine the 
Subcommittee's hearing agenda ahead of an FAA reauthorization 
markup. The Subcommittee held five hearings over the first half 
of 2023, each of which helped to inform specific titles of the 
SGRLAA Act:

    Beginning on June 13, 2023, the Committee held a two-day 
markup of the SGRLAA Act and considered 137 amendments.\14\ The 
Committee unanimously voted to favorably report the SGRLAA Act 
out of Committee on June 14, 2023.\15\ The SGRLAA Act was then 
considered by the House beginning on July 19, 2023, and after 
two days of debate and the adoption of 81 amendments, the House 
passed the SGRLAA Act by a vote of 351 to 69 on July 20,

    The Senate Commerce Committee scheduled a markup of their 
FAA reauthorization bill, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2023, 
for June 15, 2023, one day after the House Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee unanimously passed its own 
proposal.\21\ However, upon gaveling into the markup, the 
Committee quickly recessed subject to the call of the Chair. 
The Senate Commerce Committee's markup remains in recess more 
than five months later.

Before the S. Comm. on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 118th 
Cong. (June 15, 2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While the House dealt with policy disagreements by voting 
on issues through regular order, the Senate remains at an 
impasse on resolving a small number of issues, notably 
including pilot training requirements and the availability of 
slots at Reagan Washington National Airport, that must be 
resolved before the Commerce Committee will continue 
consideration of an FAA reauthorization bill.

           III. THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF EXTENSIONS ON AVIATION

    On September 30, 2023, Congress enacted H.R. 5860, a short-
term Continuing Resolution that included language to extend 
FAA's statutory authorities through December 31, 2023, in the 
absence of Congress enacting a long-term FAA bill before the 
2018 Act expired.\22\ H.R. 5860 allows the FAA to obligate 
Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grant funding, maintain air 
traffic controller hiring and training at a time when the FAA 
continues to face staffing challenges, continue all contracted 
work, avoid furloughs of non-essential employees working on 
non-safety-related but still critical projects like rulemaking, 
and prevents the AATF from losing over $50 million in aviation 
excise tax revenues per day.\23\

and Other Extensions Act, Pub. L. No. 118-15, 137 Stat. 71.
    \23\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    However, continuous extensions only serve to prolong the 
outdated status quo. Without a new, comprehensive 
reauthorization, the newly confirmed FAA Administrator, Michael 
Whitaker, lacks a roadmap of Congressional priorities spanning 
the length of his five-year appointment. Another extension also 
does not provide the FAA, its workforce, or the private sector 
with the certainty that each requires and deserves to conduct 
their business, nor does it provide protections for emerging 
issues facing the traveling public. Furthermore, another 
extension does not address systemic problems identified within 
the FAA over the last few years, including the need to adopt 
long overdue changes to policy and regulatory requirements to 
ensure American aviation remains a global leader. Finally, an 
extension does not provide for any necessary increases in 
authorization levels for key civil aviation programs, 
especially those that address crucial workforce, infrastructure 
and strategic planning needs across the aviation sector.
    Unfortunately, Congress has historically resorted to 
enacting FAA extensions--ranging from a few days to a few 
years--to maintain the integrity of programs and safety in the 
National Airspace System (NAS) in the absence of long-term 
reauthorization bills. From October 2007 through February 2012, 
Congress passed and enacted 23 FAA authorization extension 
bills. In 2015, the United States Government Accountability 
Office (GAO) reviewed the impact of this series of extensions 
(including a short-term lapse in FAA's authorization in 2011) 
and the coinciding budgetary uncertainty. Amongst its findings, 
the GAO found that ``[w]ithout a long-term authorization from 
2007 through 2012, FAA delayed new investment decisions for FAA 
sponsored airport projects'' and that ``[t]he lapse in FAA's 
authorization in 2011 specifically led to the stoppage of work 
on more than $10 billion in national airspace and support 
projects, and $2.5 billion in grants to new airport projects 
were withheld, according to FAA documentation [the GAO] 
reviewed.'' \24\

TIMELY ACTION NEEDED

    Fiscal and contractual strain on the FAA are not the only 
impacts of an extension. While Congressional inaction 
continues, the United States aviation system continues to 
evolve. Within the hundreds of provisions in the House-passed 
reauthorization bill awaiting Senate consideration and action, 
are important changes that continue to be delayed, and each 
day, aviation policy falls increasingly out of step with the 
system it is meant to manage. Congress must act expeditiously 
to address a growing list of problems, including:

at major United States airports that put the safety of the 
traveling public at risk.\25\

                                ADDENDUM

    An overview of the primary titles of the House-passed FAA 
Reauthorization bill, the SGRLAA Act.

          Title I--Authorizations and FAA Organization Reform

    The SGRLAA Act makes targeted changes to the FAA's 
organizational structure to improve its overall efficiency, 
better position the agency to innovate and streamline 
regulatory processes. It clarifies the roles of offices within 
the agency to streamline approval processes and spur decision 
making; designates an ombudsman to support pilots, small 
businesses, and other entities with applications before the 
agency that aren't progressing; creates an innovation office 
tasked with tackling cross-office policy issues; and 
establishes a new Assistant Administrator to improve the FAA's 
rulemaking processes. The SGRLAA Act also closes several 
rulemaking projects that are no longer relevant and relieves 
the agency from burdensome activities that are underutilized to 
allow the FAA to prioritize its resources elsewhere.
    The SGRLAA Act reauthorizes funding levels for the FAA that 
better represent the agency's current work and makes historic 
investments in the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) by 
increasing this funding from $3.35 billion to $4 billion 
annually.

                       Title II--General Aviation

    America's aviation system would not be where it is today 
without a healthy general aviation sector, and in fact, most of 
all aviation professionals these days, including pilots and 
mechanics, get their start in general aviation. The SGRLAA Act 
recognizes that the success of the United States aviation 
system is built upon a strong general aviation foundation. The 
SGRLAA Act includes the first-ever general aviation title to 
secure our aviation industry's long-term success by addressing 
safety gaps and process inefficiencies in the general aviation 
sector. These include provisions to expand BasicMed, ensure 
transparency, and improve incentivize increased use of on-board 
safety technology in the general aviation fleet.

                     Title III--Aerospace Workforce

    The SGRLAA Act addresses workforce challenges by removing 
barriers to pursuing aviation careers, increasing investment in 
workforce development programs and creating a National Center 
for the Advancement of Aerospace to ensure a robust talent 
pipeline, directing FAA to reform its air traffic controller 
hiring and staffing models, improving pilot training standards, 
and supporting the career transition between the military and 
civilian workforces.

                    Title IV--Airport Infrastructure

    The SGRLAA Act authorizes a historic increase in funding to 
$4 billion annually for the AIP, which has been stagnant since 
2012. This funding increase includes provisions prioritizing 
investments for small and GA airports and acts to streamline 
grant requirements to expedite project deliveries. Furthermore, 
the SGRLAA Act allows airports to use AIP funding for airport 
resiliency projects and creates a minimum level of annual AIP 
discretionary funding for certain airport programs. The bill 
also adds a dollar-based categorical exclusion for airport 
projects with limited Federal assistance, allowing airports to 
finish projects more quickly.

                        Title V--Aviation Safety

    The SGRLAA Act addresses several safety issues to ensure 
the United States remains the world's gold standard in aviation 
safety. The SGRLAA Act addresses the recent uptick in runway 
incursions by expanding the use of new ground detection and 
surveillance technologies and addressing underlying surface 
safety risks. The SGRLAA Act addresses operational and 
certification risks while ensuring the FAA appropriately 
regulates industry stakeholders and encourages the agency to 
improve its international engagement. It also requires the FAA 
to better leverage safety data to predict and mitigate risks, 
and addresses cybersecurity risks within both the FAA and 
aviation industry. Additionally, the bill ensures that foreign 
aircraft repair stations are subject to the same standards as 
American repair stations. Furthermore, the bill helps to ensure 
the safety of flight crews and passengers by requiring the FAA 
to propose requirements for retrofitting secondary barriers on 
airplanes, and to develop recommendations to prevent assaults 
against airline personnel.

                     Title VI--Aerospace Innovation

    The SGRLAA Act encourages safer and more efficient testing 
and integration of new technologies, such as drones and AAM, 
into the airspace to preserve our competitive edge in these 
emerging sectors. The bill achieves this by creating a 
regulatory framework that allows the FAA to pursue avenues for 
the safe expansion of drone operations and applying realistic 
deadlines for the agency to meet, requiring rules for BVLOS UAS 
operations and risk-based operational approvals, ensuring there 
are appropriate requirements for powered-lift aircraft entry-
into-service, and supporting the continued operation of 
commercial space transportation.
    Furthermore, the SGRLAA Act supports local communities' 
efforts to leverage the benefits of new aviation technologies 
by providing funding for state, local and Tribal governments to 
use drones to visually inspect, repair and maintain critical 
infrastructure, and funds grants for state and local 
governments to plan for future AAM operations. It also ensures 
the important voices of local communities and current airspace 
users are heard as new entrants emerge in U.S. skies.

              Title VII--Passenger Experience Improvements

    The SGRLAA Act will preserve air travel as a reliable mode 
of transportation by including reforms to holistically enhance 
the passenger experience for all members of the travelling 
public. It directs airlines to improve personnel training and 
address damage to wheelchairs and mobility aids to improve 
accessibility for passengers with disabilities, directs the FAA 
to make improvements to the air traffic control system and 
infrastructure, addresses the increased cost of Essential Air 
Service while ensuring the program continues, makes targeted 
reforms to small community air service programs.
    Furthermore, the SGRLAA Act ensures the Department of 
Transportation (DOT) recognizes that they too play a pivotal 
role in on-time passenger travel. For instance, it directs DOT 
to require airlines to develop policies addressing 
reimbursement for passengers for hotel and meal costs when a 
flight is cancelled or significantly delayed. The bill also 
requires airlines to develop airline operation resiliency plans 
to help prevent and limit the impact of mass flight disruptions 
and requires airlines to establish policies on allowing 
passengers to sit next to their young child if adjacent seats 
are available.

                       Title VIII--Miscellaneous

    The aviation system in the United States is complex and 
diverse and requires Congressional attention in many areas. The 
SGRLAA Act addresses several unique needs and challenges to 
ensure our system remains the gold standard. It requires the 
FAA to establish an updated internal telework policy, addresses 
issues related to aircraft certification and manufacturing 
standards, strengthens certain protections for crewmembers and 
gate agents, and includes several studies and reports on issues 
such as the FAA's aging information technology infrastructure, 
congested airspace, the aviation workforce, aircraft noise, 
airline mergers and air cargo operations to inform Congress's 
and the FAA's work going forward.

Title IX--National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Amendments Act of 
                                  2023

    As the independent Federal agency responsible for 
investigating all civil aviation accidents, as well as 
accidents in other modes of transportation, the NTSB plays an 
important role in transportation safety. The NTSB was last 
authorized for four years in the 2018 FAA Reauthorization 
Act.\34\ The SGRLAA Act rectifies the lapse in NTSB 
authorization and provides necessary updates such as requiring 
the NTSB to address gaps in its workforce and technical 
capabilities, establishing necessary oversight of the NTSB, and 
improving delivery of family assistance.

    TURBULENCE AHEAD: CONSEQUENCES OF DELAYING A LONG-TERM FAA BILL

                              ----------                              


                      THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 2023

                  House of Representatives,
                          Subcommittee on Aviation,
            Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:06 a.m. in 
room 2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Garret Graves 
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Good morning. The Subcommittee on 
Aviation will come to order.
    I ask unanimous consent the chairman be authorized to 
declare a recess at any time during today's hearing.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    I also ask unanimous consent that Members not on the 
subcommittee be permitted to sit on the subcommittee at today's 
hearing and ask questions.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    As a reminder, if Members wish to insert a document into 
the record for the hearing, please also email it to 
DocumentsTI@mail.house.gov.
    I now recognize myself for the purposes of making an 
opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GARRET GRAVES OF LOUISIANA, CHAIRMAN, 
                    SUBCOMMITTEE ON AVIATION

    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. I want to thank all the witnesses 
for being here today. As you all know, we do an aviation bill 
every 5 years, and the last bill we did was in 2018. I am not a 
math wizard, but we need to do a bill this year. We are 
currently operating under a temporary extension.
    More importantly, we are doing an aviation bill not just 
because there is an expiration, but because there's an 
extraordinary amount of work to be done. Much of that work is a 
result of the fact that we had challenges within the FAA with 
the MAX incident, the fact that we have gone without a full 
Administrator, have had an Acting Administrator for way too 
long of a period of time. And I want to take a minute and say 
that I am very excited about the Administrator that is there, I 
appreciate the strong support that was demonstrated in his 
confirmation in the United States Senate, and I look forward to 
working closely with him.
    But more importantly, we have seen innovators, as we are 
going to hear more about today, develop technologies that go 
well beyond the regulatory framework or the organizational 
structure contemplated by the FAA. We have seen where air 
traffic control capacity has limited or restricted flights into 
areas like Florida, like in the Northeast Corridor, therefore 
limiting options for consumers. We have seen where runway 
incursions have threatened the safety and the lives of 
passengers, and this is during a period where we have seen 
extraordinary progress in safety in the last decade compared to 
the previous decade. I think we had something like 140 deaths 
two decades ago, whereas over the last decade, I think we had 
3: an extraordinary difference and huge progress in safety.
    We passed our bill in July, and here we have a House of 
Representatives that is as polarized as I have ever seen it. We 
can't even agree if gravity is real, yet we had a vote with 351 
folks in support, and only 69 folks that were confused on that 
legislation. And I want to thank Ranking Member Cohen and 
Ranking Member Larsen, and, obviously, our chairman, Sam 
Graves, for the hard work, and the entire aviation team and 
Members. I reminded some of our Members yesterday we had 2,000 
unique submissions from Members of Congress, stakeholders, and 
others on this legislation. We put a bill together that got a 
unanimous vote in the committee and an incredibly strong vote 
in the House of Representatives.
    This isn't about just passing legislation for the purposes 
of being able to hang a memorial on the wall. This is about 
innovation. It's about safety. It's about ensuring that the 
United States maintains its leadership in aviation technology 
and in aviation safety. And it is absolutely critical that the 
United States Senate move this bill.
    I am going to say it again. I think that safety is at risk, 
I think that American leadership and aviation is at risk. And 
I'm looking forward to hearing from our witnesses today to 
learn more about their perspective, but we cannot continue to 
remain stuck or remain sort of centered on a number of these 
key issues that require decisions, that require law changes, 
that require organizational changes. I can't emphasize enough 
about the importance of moving this bill forward.
    And clearly, when you look at issues that have been raised 
including just recently, when new safety standards came out by 
the National Airspace System Safety Review Team that issued a 
scathing report looking at issues that needed to be fixed in 
the aviation industry, when I look at our bill, I say, gosh, 
actually, I think we got it right. We addressed a number of the 
issues preemptively, or before the report was even issued. And 
I think that we really have struck that right balance. I am not 
going to tell you that the bill is perfect, but I will tell you 
it is pretty damn close, and I am very excited about the 
progress that we have made.
    So, with that, I want to again thank the witnesses for 
being here. I once again want to urge the United States Senate 
to move forward as quickly as possible.
    [Mr. Graves of Louisiana's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
   Prepared Statement of Hon. Garret Graves of Louisiana, Chairman, 
                        Subcommittee on Aviation
    I want to thank all the witnesses for being here today. As you all 
know, we reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) every 
five years, but we've operated under a temporary extension of the 2018 
authorization since September.
    We passed the U.S. House of Representatives FAA reauthorization 
bill in July despite the chamber being the most polarized I've ever 
seen it. Yet, the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American 
Aviation Act passed the chamber with an overwhelming vote of 351-69 
after unanimous support in this committee.
    That vote was the result of 2,000 unique requests from Members of 
Congress and stakeholders. I want to thank Subcommittee Ranking Member 
Steve Cohen, Full Committee Ranking Member Rick Larsen, and our 
Chairman Sam Graves, as well as the entire Aviation Subcommittee team 
and our colleagues within the full committee for their work to support 
such a comprehensive piece of reform.
    Congress doesn't do an FAA bill just because the agency's 
authorization lapses, but because there's an extraordinary amount of 
work to be done. Over the past few years, the FAA has experienced an 
immense set of challenges: the 737 MAX incidents, the bust-and-boom 
nature of the pandemic, and restrictions on flight capacity--
particularly in Florida and in the Northeast--which have limited 
options for consumers. Additionally, we have seen aviation innovators 
develop technologies that go well beyond the regulatory framework or 
the organizational structure of the FAA. Meanwhile, we were without a 
U.S. Senate-confirmed FAA administrator for over a year and a half.
    I look forward to working with the new administrator and am pleased 
that he has focused first and foremost on safety. Two decades ago, 
commercial aviation saw 140 deaths in a 10-year period; however, in the 
past decade there were only three. This shows immense progress in 
safety, and that needs to be maintained and strengthened. However, 
recently there has been an alarming instance of runway incursions.
    It is absolutely critical that the United States Senate move 
forward to pass this reauthorization. Without a full reauthorization of 
the FAA, safety is at risk and American leadership in aviation 
technology and innovation is at risk. This agency cannot continue to 
remain in limbo on a number of key issues that require decisions, law 
changes, and organizational reforms. I cannot emphasize enough the 
importance of moving this bill forward, especially where safety is 
concerned.
    Recently, the FAA's independent National Airspace System Safety 
Review Team (SRT) issued a scathing report detailing a number of 
aviation industry issues that need to be fixed.
    When I look at the U.S. House's FAA reauthorization bill, I say, 
`Gosh, actually, I think we got it right.' We addressed a number of 
those issues in our bill before the report was even issued, and I think 
we really have struck that right balance. I won't tell you that the 
bill is perfect--but I will tell you that it is pretty close.
    With that, I want to again thank the witnesses for being here. I 
again want to urge the United States Senate to move forward on the FAA 
bill as quickly as possible and look forward to hearing from our 
witnesses on why this is such a critical issue.

    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. I look forward to hearing from our 
ranking member, Mr. Cohen, and recognize him for 5 minutes.

  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. STEVE COHEN OF TENNESSEE, RANKING 
                MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON AVIATION

    Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Chairman Graves. It is good to be 
here with the Aviation Subcommittee.
    We had four subcommittee hearings on this bill and one full 
committee hearing on FAA reauthorization and had the 
opportunity to examine and discuss various aviation priorities, 
from ensuring safety, which is, of course, number 1, to 
improving the passenger experience, which is 1(a), to general 
aviation and the safe integration of emerging technologies and 
more.
    We worked in a bipartisan manner to pass our FAA 
reauthorization out of the full committee and to the House, 
where it had overwhelming support with 69 wayward people who 
did not understand the issues, as Mr. Graves has clearly 
pointed out. And we are here today because our colleagues in 
the other Chamber have not made the same progress.
    I have heard for years variations on a theme that the enemy 
is not the other party, the enemy is the Senate. And in this 
committee, it really is. When I come in here, I don't really 
look at the division here between this side of the aisle and 
that side of the aisle as a division. We are the Aviation 
Subcommittee, and we are the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee. But the Senate, it's the Senate. So, we have to hope 
that the Senate Commerce Committee will get its act together 
and mark up this bill. They have had 5 months when they have 
been in recess for those 5 months, and the House has dealt with 
policy disagreements by voting on issues through regular order.
    Reauthorizing the FAA in a timely manner is vital to the 
continuity of the U.S. aviation industry and helps ensure 
aviation safety, infrastructure, and workforce development 
programs remain top priorities. Workforce development is so 
important because we need more and more people as FAA 
employees, working on flight safety--there are not enough 
employees there right now. So, we need more, and we need to 
bring them through the process, get them into the process, and 
open it up to more and more people.
    By passing short-term extensions, which we have already 
done once to extend the FAA's authorities through December and 
will likely have to do it again before the end of the year, we 
continue to perpetuate the outdated status quo that jeopardizes 
our global leadership in aviation. The absence of a long-term 
FAA reauthorization is a disservice to the agency's hard-
working employees, the industry, and the traveling public.
    So, we have got a new Administrator, Mr. Whitaker. He is at 
a disadvantage, but he is going to be a good one. And we needed 
a new Administrator, and we got a good one.
    The extensions have temporarily worked in the past, but the 
National Airspace System has advanced to a point where such 
extensions fail to address systemic problems and new 
challenges, especially those that require significant 
regulatory and policy improvements to keep the U.S. on the 
cutting edge of aerospace.
    Furthermore, the use of continued extensions not only 
creates uncertainty within the aviation industry, but often 
results in the delay of FAA-sponsored airport projects that are 
critical to proving airport infrastructure. If not evident 
already, the overreliance on extensions has proven detrimental 
and will result in the failure to address a litany of critical 
issues, including:
    <bullet> LSafety concerns at airports such as runway near-
misses, and I guess that's the biggest thing we've got, and 
that's the thing Mr. Whitaker spoke to me about as his first 
priority was the runway near-misses, and that's serious 
business. There are not enough folks there overseeing traffic.
    <bullet> LSafety management systems expansion,
    <bullet> LFostering technological advancements in the NAS, 
and
    <bullet> LInsufficient investment in airports and NextGen 
technologies.

    For these reasons and more, there is the need to pass our 
comprehensive bill, which is vital to the continuity and safety 
of U.S. aviation.
    Our House-passed bill makes historic airport infrastructure 
investments; enhances safety; and protects consumers, including 
those with disabilities, which is very important--and we just 
saw some issue with a wheelchair being cavalierly tossed down a 
ramp, and people need to be more concerned about that--
addresses environmental resiliency; ensures the safe operation 
and integration of unmanned aircraft systems and advanced air 
mobility aircraft; and improves the development of the U.S. 
aviation workforce, especially in minority communities.
    Just last week, the independent Safety Review Team, 
assembled by the FAA in response to multiple close calls at 
airports, issued a 52-page report calling on the FAA and 
Congress to address safety risks in our Nation's aviation 
system. In the report, the safety group highlighted a multitude 
of issues such as staffing shortages among air traffic 
controllers and outdated technology. As the Safety Review Team 
stated, ``There are no easy short-term fixes to address many of 
these challenges. Addressing risk in the [NAS] requires the 
FAA, the administration, Congress, and others to work together 
collaboratively.''
    There is no better place to start than in Congress by 
sending our House-passed, long-term reauthorization bill to the 
President's desk. Our bill preserves and enhances America's 
aviation system, which was the world's gold standard, probably 
still is, but needs to have improvements. It contains hundreds 
of provisions that will benefit our system and remains delayed 
in the Senate.
    So, this committee, I think, if it was a microcosm of 
Congress, George Santos wouldn't have anything to talk about. 
Instead, he lies and tells terrible things about the Congress. 
If he was talking about the Senate, so be it, but not the House 
of Representatives.
    I yield back the balance of my time.

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Steve Cohen of Tennessee, Ranking Member, 
                        Subcommittee on Aviation
    Thank you. It's great to be here with Chairman Graves for another 
Aviation Subcommittee hearing.
    Earlier this year, we held four Subcommittee hearings and one full 
Committee hearing on FAA reauthorization, where we had the opportunity 
to examine and discuss various aviation priorities--from ensuring 
safety to improving the passenger experience, to general aviation and 
the safe integration of emerging technologies and more.
    While we worked in a bipartisan way to pass our FAA reauthorization 
bill out of our full Committee and in the House--with overwhelming 
votes of support--we are here today because our colleagues in the other 
chamber have not made the same progress.
    The Senate Commerce Committee's markup on their FAA reauthorization 
bill has been in recess for more than five months, and while the House 
dealt with policy disagreements by voting on issues through regular 
order, the Senate remains at an impasse.
    Reauthorizing the FAA in a timely matter is vital to the continuity 
of the U.S. aviation industry and helps to ensure aviation safety, 
infrastructure, and workforce development programs remain top 
priorities at such a critical juncture.
    By continuing to pass short term extensions, which we have already 
done once to extend the FAA's authorities through December, and will 
likely have to do once more before the end of the year, we continue to 
perpetuate the outdated status quo that jeopardizes our global 
leadership in aviation.
    The absence of a long-term FAA reauthorization is a disservice to 
the agency and its hardworking employees, the aviation industry, and 
the traveling public. Furthermore, it places the newly appointed FAA 
Administrator, Mr. Mike Whitaker, at a disadvantage as he aims to 
maintain aviation safety and ensure the efficiency of U.S. airspace.
    Although extensions have temporarily worked in the past, the 
National Airspace System (NAS) has advanced to a point where such 
extensions fail to address systemic problems and new challenges, 
especially those that require significant regulatory and policy 
improvements to keep the U.S. on the cutting-edge of aerospace 
technology.
    Further, the use of continual extensions not only creates 
uncertainty within the aviation industry, but often results in the 
delay of FAA-sponsored airport projects that are critical to improving 
airport infrastructure.
    If not evident already, the overreliance on extensions for the FAA 
has proven detrimental and will result in the failure to address a 
litany of critical issues, including:
    <bullet>  Safety concerns at airports, such as runway near-misses;
    <bullet>  Safety management systems expansion;
    <bullet>  Fostering technological advancements in the NAS; and
    <bullet>  Insufficient investment in airports and NexGen 
technologies.

    For these reasons and many more, the need to pass a long-term 
comprehensive FAA reauthorization bill is vital to the safety and 
continuity of U.S. aviation.
    Our House-passed bill makes historic airport infrastructure 
investments, enhances aviation safety, protects consumers including 
those with disabilities, addresses environmental resiliency, ensures 
the safe operation and integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) 
and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) aircraft, and improves the development 
of the U.S. aviation workforce, especially in minority communities.
    Just last week, the independent Safety Review Team assembled by the 
FAA in response to multiple close calls at airports across the country 
issued a 52-page report calling on the FAA and Congress to address 
safety risks in our nation's aviation system.
    In the report, the safety group highlighted a multitude of issues 
such as staffing shortages among air traffic controllers and outdated 
technology.
    As the Safety Review Team stated, ``There are no easy short-term 
fixes to address many of these challenges. Addressing risk in the [NAS] 
requires the FAA, the administration, Congress and others across 
industry to work together collaboratively.''
    I can think of no better place to start than by Congress sending 
our House-passed long-term reauthorization bill to the President's 
desk.
    Our bill preserves and enhances America's aviation system, which is 
the world's gold standard, and ensures a robust and vibrant future for 
U.S. aviation.
    It contains hundreds of provisions that will benefit and improve 
our aviation system now, but the bill remains delayed while we wait on 
Senate action.
    It is my hope that FAA extensions will be a thing of the past after 
this year. I encourage our Senate colleagues to work swiftly to pass 
their bill so that we can negotiate our differences in conference and 
move forward with a robust five-year reauthorization.
    I thank all the witnesses for being here today and look forward to 
today's discussion.

    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Cohen, and I want 
to thank you for raising the passenger experience issue that I 
omitted. I am not going to comment on the rest of your speech, 
particularly the closing, but I do want to thank you for 
raising that, because that needs to remain our primary focus 
here.
    With that, I yield 5 minutes to the ranking member of the 
full committee, the gentleman from Washington, Mr. Larsen.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING 
     MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair Graves, for 
calling today's hearing to reinforce the need for a long-term, 
comprehensive FAA reauthorization.
    The last few years have exacerbated ongoing challenges 
facing our aviation system, and Congress has a responsibility 
to address these challenges to ensure the U.S. remains the gold 
standard in aviation. This committee engaged in a thoughtful 
and holistic process to draft the Securing Growth and Robust 
Leadership in American Aviation Act earlier this year. While 
there are certainly times when we disagreed, we put those 
issues to a vote. We accepted the outcome of those votes, and 
moved the final product in a bipartisan way to the floor of the 
House, and passed it on the floor 351 to 69.
    There is a need to act. Last February, a Boeing 767 cargo 
plane almost landed on a Boeing 737 passenger plane at Austin 
International Airport. Without the quick action by the cargo 
plane pilots, 131 lives could have been lost. Similar near-miss 
accidents have occurred at Philadelphia, Memphis, Miami, 
Chicago, New York, and Las Vegas.
    As a result of the spike in these incidents, the FAA 
commissioned an independent Safety Review Team, or SRT, this 
past April to recommend ways to enhance safety and reliability 
of the Nation's air traffic system. Those recommendations, 
delivered earlier this month, validate much of what this 
committee found as it engaged with stakeholders during the FAA 
reauthorization process.
    One of those conclusions bears highlighting today: `` . . . 
the current erosion in the margin of safety in the [National 
Airspace System] caused by the confluence of these challenges 
is rendering the current level of safety unsustainable.'' So, I 
commend newly appointed FAA Administrator Whitaker as the FAA 
announced six steps it will take to start addressing the 
report's findings, especially regarding air traffic controller 
hiring and training.
    One of the critical findings in the SRT report is that 
``the combined effect of irregular operations [caused] by 
[controller] staff shortages erodes the margin of safety in the 
NAS.'' It then calls on stakeholders in the aviation ecosystem 
to take immediate action to ensure the U.S. remains the gold 
standard in aviation safety.
    The House-passed FAA reauthorization is precisely what the 
report calls for, taking significant steps towards keeping the 
U.S. aviation system the safest in the world.
    Section 314 specifically addresses the staffing challenges 
that the SRT found, requiring the FAA to hire the maximum 
number of air traffic controllers and to adopt the most 
appropriate controller staffing model, as determined by an 
independent third party, to ensure our controller workforce 
accurately reflects the system's growing needs.
    Section 501 addresses another finding in the report by 
requiring the installation of surface surveillance technology 
at all medium- and large-hub airports to help prevent future 
runway incursions.
    Section 221 addresses the report's equipage findings by 
renewing the ADS-B rebate program to incentivize broader 
equipage of onboard safety technologies for all aircraft.
    These are crucial reforms, and this committee did its work.
    Now, safety goes hand in hand with other critical needs in 
the air transportation system also addressed in the House bill. 
Last December, Courtney Edwards, a 34-year-old airport ramp 
worker and mother of three, was pulled into an Embraer E175 jet 
engine and killed while working at the ramp at Montgomery 
Regional Airport. This tragic incident highlights the dangers 
that our aviation workforce braves every day to ensure the 
safety of the traveling public. The House-passed bill includes 
a ramp safety call to action. It makes robust investments in 
preparing and protecting the next generation of pilots, 
maintenance technicians, manufacturing workers, and other 
critical professions to support the rapidly evolving global 
aviation sector.
    Just this week, a passenger in Miami allegedly assaulted 
and knocked a gate agent unconscious, causing ``a significant 
amount of blood'' and delaying the flight by several hours. As 
unruly passengers continue to pose a threat to flightcrews and 
other frontline workers, our bill protects workers by creating 
a task force to prevent assaults and mandating that airlines 
establish employee assault and response plans.
    And in recent years, flight cancellations and delays have 
shaken the flying public's confidence in our system. I recall 
last December's meltdown that left thousands of passengers 
stranded and ruined many Americans' holiday travel plans. To 
get us back on the right course, our House bill requires 
airlines to create resiliency plans to help prevent mass flight 
disruptions and have policies to reimburse passengers for 
expenses incurred from these disruptions.
    While preventing mass flight disruptions is one way to 
protect consumers, we must do more to ensure all passengers can 
travel safely and with dignity. Last week's video appearing to 
show a wheelchair being intentionally mishandled in Miami made 
clear that more work is needed to ensure dignified travel for 
all Americans. The House bill improves training for airline 
personnel and contractors on assisting travelers with 
disabilities and mobility devices, and directs the DOT to 
create a roadmap for airlines to reduce damage to wheelchairs 
and mobility aids.
    And as the impacts of climate change are felt in 
communities nationwide, this bill makes groundbreaking 
investments in sustainability, including allowing Federal 
funding for hydrogen and unleaded fuel infrastructure.
    The bill also increases funding for the Airport Improvement 
Program from $3.35 billion to $4 billion annually, of which at 
least $150 million in discretionary funds, the largest portion 
ever required before, is to be used to support airport 
environmental and noise programs.
    In conclusion, the current and future challenges facing the 
U.S. aviation system are significant. I believe we can meet 
them. It requires urgent and decisive action by all of 
Congress. The House did its job. This committee did its job. 
Congratulations on that. I look forward to hearing from today's 
witnesses on the consequences of further delaying FAA 
reauthorization, and I look forward to someday soon 
conferencing with the Senate to get a long-term bill to the 
President's desk.
    With that, I yield back.

  TESTIMONY OF PETER J. BUNCE, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
      OFFICER, GENERAL AVIATION MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION

    Mr. Bunce. Chairman Garret Graves, Ranking Member Cohen, 
Chairman Sam Graves, and Ranking Member Larsen, thank you for 
calling this hearing to address this critical need for us to 
get finished with the FAA reauthorization bill.
    I have been doing this job at GAMA for now 19 years, and I 
have never seen a time that is more important for us to get the 
FAA reauthorized and address some of the critical issues that 
both of you addressed in your opening remarks, along with 
Ranking Member Larsen, but also many of the other things that 
facilitate safety that aren't talked about in the press these 
days.
    To watch what this committee did earlier this year, as a 
taxpayer, I was very proud to know the members of this 
committee. To be able to go ahead and mark out a committee in a 
unanimous form a very important piece of legislation is a model 
of legislative governance. And then how you handled the 
amendment process, in addition, really serves as testament not 
only to this committee's members, but also this incredible 
staff that you have that really worked together to produce a 
great bill.
    And the time could not be more critical to be able to 
finish the job. When we look at the challenges that 
Administrator Whitaker has in front of him, they are daunting. 
And it was really important for all of us also to note that 
over on the Senate side, his nomination was handled in a very 
thoughtful process. It shouldn't be lost on anybody that 
Chairman Sam Graves went over to introduce Mr. Whitaker to the 
Senate, and the proof is in the pudding. They confirmed him in 
a unanimous vote and gave him a mandate that he needs to be 
able to fix a lot of the critical issues that are facing not 
only the FAA, but also in its relationship with DOT and the 
rest of the administration.
    Earlier this week, the Management Advisory Council to the 
FAA, of which both myself and Mr. Santa are privileged to be 
members, sent a letter to the leadership of both the House and 
Senate talking about the critical importance and what we need 
Mr. Whitaker to focus on and not be distracted from.
    If we don't get an FAA reauthorization bill done, the 
Administrator has to handle all of the disruptions that are 
handled with continuing resolutions, extensions. But also, when 
you couple that with a potential for shutdowns, which--people 
don't realize what kind of perturbations that forces upon 
industry when something like that happens, but also to be able 
to get stability through getting the fiscal year 2024 
appropriations bill passed. They need the stability and the 
resources to be able to complete the tasks of being able to 
address the issues.
    We have been for far too long without an FAA leader, but 
also there was a domino effect. So, we had many of the 
positions within the FAA and acting positions. That has now 
sorted itself out with Mr. Whitaker being in place, and the 
result is we can now move forward on fixing a lot of the 
issues. This committee really addressed a lot of those issues 
through previous hearings.
    Of course, we all know that Mr. Santa's organization, 
NATCA, and the controllers out there are understaffed and 
overworked. And this bill, as Ranking Member Larsen talked 
about, really starts to address that.
    But also, the slow pace of employees getting back to work 
in the office, especially in the certification directorate, is 
critical--it is really hampering industry right now because the 
workforce is so green, they have lost so much expertise right 
now. We have got to be able to train them, which this bill 
addresses.
    And also, it addresses the regulatory process, which, right 
now, we all know is so long and laborious that other leading 
authorities in other nations are now starting to exert their 
leadership in the global environment to be able to have their 
regulations be preeminent.
    The need to keep pace with technology is so important. 
Technology can solve a lot of the issues, especially that 
Ranking Member Larsen just talked about. We can provide 
technology not only to Mr. Santa's controllers, but also to the 
pilots to enhance their situational awareness. But we have got 
to be able to get through the certification process to get that 
done.
    And the need for investments in the workforce to not only 
focus on pilots and maintenance professionals, but also the 
folks that work in our factories for manufacturing to be able 
to get that complete.
    So, in sum, getting this bill done is so critical to the 
safety of this Nation, but also for our global leadership. The 
United States has always been a leader in aerospace, and to 
continue to do so, we have got to get this bill done.
    Thank you.

  Prepared Statement of Peter J. Bunce, President and Chief Executive 
          Officer, General Aviation Manufacturers Association
    Subcommittee Chairman Garret Graves, Ranking Member Steve Cohen, 
Chairman Sam Graves, and Ranking Member Rick Larsen, on behalf of the 
General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) and its member 
companies, thank you for convening today's hearing which focuses on the 
importance of Congress moving at maximum velocity operating speed to 
enact a long-term Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization 
bill. As I testified at the Committee's kickoff FAA Reauthorization 
hearing on aviation safety in February, this legislation is critically 
needed to support FAA leadership, direction, and stability and 
facilitate the aviation sector's future path towards increasing levels 
of safety and innovation.
    By way of background, GAMA represents more than 140 of the world's 
leading manufacturers of general aviation airplanes and rotorcraft, 
engines, avionics, advanced air mobility aircraft (AAM), components, 
and related services and technologies. GAMA members are also providers 
of maintenance and repair services, fixed-based operations, pilot and 
maintenance training, and aircraft management companies. GAMA companies 
have facilities in 48 states and 27 countries. A recent economic impact 
study determined that the general aviation industry supports $247 
billion in economic output and 1.2 million jobs in the U.S.\1\

Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in Aviation Act (H.R. 3935) \2\. 
Your timely work earlier this year reauthorizing the FAA is a 
tremendous accomplishment and is deeply appreciated and strongly 
praised by our membership. We support the strong general aviation focus 
in the bill as general aviation is a critical point of entry for pilots 
and mechanics interested in careers in the aviation industry as well as 
a critical technology incubator with benefits not only to general 
aviation but eventually the entire civil aviation industry.

    GAMA also applauds the U.S. Senate confirmation of Mike Whitaker to 
be FAA Administrator. We commend the Senate for their quick action on 
his nomination, and want to recognize members of this Committee, 
particularly Chairman Sam Graves, for their strong advocacy of this 
nomination.
    Administrator Whitaker and the agency face a critical inflection 
point in furthering our collective efforts to advance aviation safety, 
sustainability, technology, and innovation. Congress must give the 
Administrator the tools and support he and the agency need to be 
successful. Enacting a long-term reauthorization by the end of the year 
will provide a strong foundation for the agency and set a positive 
trajectory at an important juncture in time. The significance of 
enacting a timely passage of a multi-year FAA Reauthorization bill and 
confirming an FAA Administrator was recently emphasized in a letter 
from 28 aviation associations.\3\ Additionally, this week, the non-
governmental members of the FAA Management Advisory Council, of which I 
am a member, sent a letter \4\ to House and Senate leadership 
emphasizing the importance of action on FAA Reauthorization and a full 
year appropriations bill for the agency.

    For GAMA and its members, the stakes are clear: do we want 
Administrator Whitaker to spend his time managing lapses in authority 
and appropriations or focus his time on addressing the agency's 
significant challenges and taking advantage of opportunities? As we 
have seen in the past, if action is not taken now, it will have both 
near-term and long-term impacts and set the agency back substantially.
    As this Committee documented during its hearings and oversight, the 
agency faces deep challenges. These include the considerable turnover 
and loss of expertise at the agency, compounded by the slow pace of FAA 
employees returning from remote work and insufficient employee training 
and mentoring. Additionally, confirming a new Administrator took 19 
months and during that time, many positions throughout the agency were 
without permanent leadership. While some progress has been made, the 
regulatory process faces continuing backlogs and still needs reform and 
a better clarification of roles and responsibilities. All of this has 
hindered FAA efforts to further its global engagement during a 
transformative time for aviation. It is imperative that the FAA and the 
U.S. Congress address these challenges.
    We are heartened that both the House-passed FAA Reauthorization 
bill and the Senate committee leadership bill, and accompanying 
amendments, focus on many of these key challenges and issues. We look 
forward to working with policymakers in a bipartisan and bicameral 
fashion in enacting an FAA Reauthorization that contributes to 
leadership, direction, and stability at the agency.
    H.R. 3935 includes several provisions which we believe will 
strengthen the management and operation of the FAA, provide strong 
policy direction, and enhance aviation leadership with aviation 
authorities around the globe. Specifically, H.R. 3935 includes the 
establishment of a Deputy Administrator for Programs and Management, a 
Deputy Administrator for Safety and Operations, and an Associate 
Administrator for Rulemaking and Regulatory Improvement. This will help 
better manage delays in confirming new political leadership at the 
agency as well as facilitating more timely, transparent, and 
accountable promulgation of rulemaking, policy, guidance, and related 
materials. The House bill also directs reviews of the regulatory 
process to gain further improvements.
    H.R. 3935 also encourages robust FAA leadership in global civil 
aviation through engagement with international civil aviation 
authorities to facilitate validation of product and harmonize 
requirements and processes with other authorities to the benefit of 
aviation safety and industry. The House-passed bill also requires 
development of an FAA strategic plan for international engagement to 
measure compliance with international aviation safety agreements, 
strengthen FAA's international offices' activity as well as improving 
the delivery of technical assistance. These provisions, from our 
perspective, will improve global civil aviation safety, environmental 
sustainability, and facilitate U.S. aerospace competitiveness in this 
dynamic era of rapid technological innovation.
    H.R. 3935 includes needed direction to the FAA as our industry goes 
through an era of development of innovation and technology that rivals 
the dawn of the jet-age. For this reason, it is critical that FAA be 
given and simultaneously set direction and embrace technological 
development.
    H.R. 3935 also provides direction by encouraging certification 
improvements through the utilization of digital tools and software. 
Given these methods are increasingly used in design and to document 
certification activity, FAA evaluating and implementing their use on a 
more consistent basis could evolve the current paper-driven and 
transactional process to a more real-time review. This would better 
leverage technology and have aviation safety benefits as well as 
facilitating efficiencies and coordination amongst applicants and the 
FAA.
    GAMA also supports the committee's critical direction for Advanced 
Air Mobility (AAM) vehicles. This includes mandating a rulemaking to 
enable initial powered-lift operations by 2025 and a permanent 
regulatory framework for commercial operations and the integration and 
entry into the national airspace system for these vehicles within five 
years. Additionally, H.R. 3935 provides direction on infrastructure, 
including electrification, to support electric propulsion and vertical 
flight including the development of vertiports.
    We would also like to praise the inclusion, during floor debate, of 
an amendment offered by Reps. Salud Carbajal, Rudy Yakym, and Sharice 
Davids, to create a pilot program to deliver clearances via mobile 
devices (e.g., tablets) through Internet Protocol. We appreciate the 
collaboration and support of the National Air Traffic Controllers 
Association (NATCA) on this amendment. FAA-funded trials have shown 
that the functionality can be enabled safely and securely and deliver 
fuel savings and operational efficiencies.
    H.R. 3935 also underscores important workforce efforts for both FAA 
and industry. For example, the measure extends and strengthens critical 
aviation workforce development programs (Sec. 625) initially authorized 
in 2018 that focuses on pilots and maintenance workers while also 
expanding the program to add a focus on manufacturing which GAMA 
strongly supports. The addition of a manufacturing element to the 
existing program would complement the goal of improving continued 
operational safety for design, production, operation, and maintenance, 
and help build a future, more diverse workforce for the breadth of the 
aviation sector.
    From an FAA workforce perspective, the legislation directs an FAA 
workforce assessment including staffing levels, competency, and skills 
for critical safety positions in the Flight Standards Service and 
Aircraft Certification Service and the promotion of expanded training 
opportunities to enhance FAA's technical capabilities. In addition, 
H.R. 3935 encourages an FAA telework policy that is based on job 
functions, duties, and level of management.
    H.R. 3935 also highlights the ongoing Eliminate Aviation Gasoline 
Lead Emissions (EAGLE) \5\ initiative and encourages its work in the 
development and implementation of a safe transition to unleaded fuel 
for the piston-engine aircraft fleet by no later than 2030. This 
direction is increasingly important given the recent Environmental 
Protection Agency finding about lead-emissions from piston-powered 
aircraft fuel, also known as avgas.

    GAMA has great hope that FAA Administrator Whitaker, Deputy 
Administrator Thomson, and the rest of the agency can make great 
progress in addressing these challenges. However, it is imperative that 
Congress use all efforts to enact, in a bipartisan and bicameral 
fashion, a bill to reauthorize the FAA and fully join them in these 
critical efforts. Again, we appreciate and applaud the action that this 
committee, and this body, have produced with the passage of the 
Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act. Thank 
you for the opportunity to express the importance of this effort, and 
for your collective work to date. We look forward to working with you, 
and your colleagues, to provide leadership, direction, and stability to 
the FAA.

    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Colonel. Next, we have 
Mr. Santa.
    You are recognized for 5 minutes.

   TESTIMONY OF RICH SANTA, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL AIR TRAFFIC 
                CONTROLLERS ASSOCIATION, AFL-CIO

    Mr. Santa. Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Cohen, Chairman 
Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and members of the subcommittee, 
thank you so much for the opportunity to testify today.
    NATCA, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, is 
extremely pleased that the House has already taken the most 
important action that you can for the safety of the National 
Airspace System by passing a long-term, comprehensive FAA 
reauthorization bill with an overwhelming bipartisan majority 
that directly addresses several key aspects of air traffic 
control staffing, including requiring the FAA to use the 
Collaborative Resource Workgroup, the CRWG, as the basis for 
its controller workforce plan, and to maximize controller 
hiring for the duration of this bill.
    I want to individually thank the Members, committee 
leadership, and staff who took the time to understand the 
critical staffing and reporting issues, evaluated and 
formulated the solutions consisting of max hiring and required 
CRWG reporting, and ultimately crafted and supported the 
approved language in the FAA reauthorization bill. Thank you.
    There are over 1,000 fewer certified professional 
controllers today than there were a decade ago. Continuing to 
follow the same flawed model utilized by the FAA after more 
than a decade of missed hiring goals and missed staffing 
projections will continue this downward staffing trend. A new 
approach is desperately needed. The FAA must adopt the recently 
updated and more accurate operational staffing targets that 
were jointly developed by the Collaborative Resource Workgroup, 
which was comprised of the FAA's Air Traffic Organization and 
NATCA. The MITRE Corporation verified and validated this 
group's work.
    The facility staffing targets the FAA utilizes today were 
developed almost a decade ago. It is beyond time to update 
them. The new CRWG staffing targets need to be used as the 
basis for the FAA's controller workforce plan moving forward, 
so that Congress and industry have a complete and accurate 
understanding of the condition of ATC staffing and the 
requirements of the NAS.
    Understaffing requires the FAA to assign mandatory overtime 
to controllers, including 6-day workweeks, which leads to 
fatigue. Several FAA facilities require 6-day workweeks every 
single week. Air traffic control is already a highly stressful 
profession. Controllers that are required to work 200 hours per 
month amplifies that fatigue, and it inserts additional risk 
into the NAS as a result of this understaffing.
    In June, the DOT IG issued an audit concluding that, while 
the United States has one of the safest air traffic systems in 
the world, a lack of fully certified controllers poses a 
potential risk to the national operations.
    Earlier this month, the FAA's National Airspace System 
Safety Review Team concluded that, under FAA's most recent 
controller workforce plan that was submitted to Congress, when 
retirements and other attrition are accounted for, the hiring 
plan produces a negligible improvement over today's 
understaffed levels, resulting in a net increase of fewer than 
200 air traffic controllers by the year 2032.
    Let me repeat that: The current plan presented to you 
results in a net increase of fewer than 200 air traffic 
controllers by the year 2032.
    We applaud the T&I Committee for its bill that directs the 
FAA to adopt controller staffing targets to resolve these 
issues identified by both the DOT IG and the NAS Safety Review 
Team.
    But the FAA must also be transparent with its need for 
increased funding for its F&E budget. Congress has always met 
the FAA's stated need, but the agency has consistently 
requested less than it needs for runways, radar systems, 
towers, and all of its infrastructure.
    In fact, for the past 15 years, the FAA hasn't even 
adjusted their request to account for normal inflation. 
Utilizing a fix-on-fail model has led the FAA's inability to 
maintain and replace critical safety equipment that has 
exceeded its expected life, again introducing risks into the 
system. The failure of the U.S. NOTAM system earlier this year 
was a glaring example of that risk. FAA funding requests have 
delayed the FAA from designing and implementing new 
technologies to improve safety. One such example is an airport 
surface surveillance awareness tool that addresses runway 
incursions, a top safety concern.
    Finally, I want to stress the need to avoid an FAA shutdown 
at the end of this year that would force the FAA to suspend 
hiring, close its training academy, and delay modernization 
even more, which would be a major setback.
    Thank you again for helping us to resolve these issues. I 
look forward to your questions.
    [Mr. Santa's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
   Prepared Statement of Rich Santa, President, National Air Traffic 
                    Controllers Association, AFL-CIO
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the National 
Air Traffic Controllers Association, AFL-CIO (NATCA) at today's hearing 
titled ``Turbulence Ahead: Consequences of Delaying Long-Term FAA 
Bill.''
    NATCA is the exclusive representative for nearly 20,000 employees, 
including the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) air traffic 
controllers, traffic management coordinators and specialists, flight 
service station air traffic controllers, staff support specialists, 
engineers and architects, and other aviation safety professionals, as 
well as Department of Defense (DOD) and Federal Contract Tower (FCT) 
air traffic controllers.
                           Executive Summary
    The National Airspace System (NAS) moves over 45,000 flights and 
2.9 million passengers, and more than 59,000 tons of cargo every day 
across more than 29 million square miles of airspace. Although it is 
the safest, most efficient, and most complex system in the world, we 
should always strive to bolster safety, mitigate risk, and improve 
efficiency.
    The single most important action Congress can take for the safety 
of the NAS would be to pass a long-term, comprehensive FAA 
Reauthorization bill into law before the end of the year.
    NATCA applauds the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee and 
the House of Representatives for its passage of ``Securing Growth and 
Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act'' (H.R. 3935) with an 
overwhelming bipartisan majority.
    For the better part of two decades, the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA), like much of the federal government, has faced an 
unstable and unpredictable funding stream. Whether due to the risks of 
lapsed appropriations or authorizations, such interruptions have 
negatively affected all aspects of the Agency, making it increasingly 
difficult to maintain the safety and efficiency of the NAS.
    Even when the Agency is not facing the threat of a shutdown, 
multiple administrations from both parties have submitted insufficient 
FAA budget requests to Congress. FAA's requests have often fell well 
short of the resources need to meet the full needs of the NAS. 
Historically, Congress provides the Agency with the resources it 
requests through both authorization of top-line numbers and the annual 
appropriations process. However, because FAA consistently requested too 
little, there are significant backlogs of NAS system sustainment and 
ATC facility sustainment, in addition to mounting delays in the 
implementation of NAS modernization and system improvements as well as 
ATC tower and radar facility replacement.
    Air traffic controller (ATC) staffing is another area in which this 
troubling dynamic persists within' the FAA, as evident by the fact 
there are more than 1,000 fewer Certified Professional Controllers 
(CPC) than a dozen years ago. Continuing to follow the flawed 
controller staffing model developed annually by FAA's Office of Finance 
and Management after more than a decade of missed hiring goals and 
staffing projections, followed by reduced expectations the following 
year would be deeply problematic. Reducing air traffic capacity due to 
understaffing, as FAA did this past summer in the New York airspace, 
undermines the efficiency of the NAS.
    To further complicate matters, understaffing forces the FAA to 
assign mandatory overtime to controllers on a regular basis, which 
leads to fatigue. Fatigue, of course, also adds unnecessary risk into 
the NAS.
    To address the persistent staffing shortage of air traffic 
controllers, the FAA must adopt the new, more accurate operational 
staffing targets developed by the Collaborative Resources Workgroup 
(CRWG). These staffing targets should form the basis for FAA's annual 
Controller Workforce Plan (CWP) moving forward, so that Congress and 
the aviation industry have a complete and accurate view of the FAA's 
ATC staffing needs.
    We applaud the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee's 
inclusion of the CRWG's staffing targets in its long-term FAA 
reauthorization bill, the ``Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in 
American Aviation Act'' (H.R. 3935), which passed the House in July 
with an overwhelming bipartisan majority. If FAA uses the CRWG as the 
basis for its CWP, Congress will finally get a complete and accurate 
picture of the FAA's controller staffing needs. H.R. 3935 also provides 
for maximum hiring of air traffic controller trainees for the full 
five-year duration of the bill. This is a critical component as part of 
a comprehensive hiring and training strategy to meet the operational 
needs of the NAS.
    In addition to limiting NAS capacity, understaffing also requires 
FAA to assign mandatory overtime to controllers on a regular basis, 
which leads to fatigue. Fatigue increases unnecessary risk in the NAS.
    FAA must be transparent with its need for improved funding for its 
Facilities and Equipment (F&E) budget, which provides resources for 
physical infrastructure repairs and sustainment, equipment 
modernization, and major capital projects. NATCA estimates that FAA 
requires approximately $4.5 billion for F&E activities in Fiscal Year 
(FY) 2024, and this number will approach nearly $6 billion in the near 
future. Despite this increasing need, for the past decade, FAA has 
consistently requested only approximately $3 billion per year in annual 
appropriations.
    Congress has always met the Agency's stated need, but that has 
prevented FAA from meeting its own equipment sustainment, replacement, 
and modernization needs, creating a significant backlog. That backlog 
will worsen if FAA continues to submit annual budget requests that do 
not reflect its true needs moving forward. Failing to maintain and 
replace critical safety equipment that has exceeded its expected life 
introduces unnecessary risk into the system. Further, funding 
limitations prevent the FAA from designing and implementing new 
technologies that will improve safety, such as an airport surface 
surveillance situational awareness tool to address wrong surface 
landings--a top safety concern.
    NATCA's testimony will focus on: (1) the current controller 
staffing crisis and training challenges and how they could affect 
safety and efficiency; (2) the negative effects of equipment and 
infrastructure backlogs and how those affect critical modernization and 
infrastructure programs, including significantly delaying the 
development and implementation of new safety technology that will 
improve surface surveillance at airports and help mitigate the risks of 
runway incursions; and (3) the negative effects that a potential 
shutdown--due to a lapse in authorization or appropriations--would have 
on the NAS, as well as on the nearly 20,000 air traffic controllers and 
other aviation safety professionals represented by NATCA.
              I. Controller Staffing and Training Hampered
    For years, NATCA has been alerting policymakers that the controller 
staffing shortage negatively affects all aspects of the NAS. Despite 
meeting its self-imposed air traffic controller hiring goals for much 
of the past decade, the FAA has not kept up with attrition. 
Consequently, as of the end of fiscal year (FY) 2023, there were more 
than 1,000 fewer CPCs employed by the FAA than at the end of FY 2012. 
Currently, many of FAA's fully certified controllers are working 
mandatory overtime hours, frequently 6-day workweeks and 10-hour days, 
to make up for the staffing shortage. Some have even been working those 
schedules for their entire careers. Over the long-term, this will 
continue to introduce unnecessary risk into the system.
    When there are too few fully certified professional controllers 
(CPCs), positions have to be combined, resulting in divided attention 
between different responsibilities. Most commonly, controller staffing 
shortages are mitigated through reducing efficiency--meaning flight 
delays. Chronically understaffed facilities also introduce unnecessary 
safety risks into the system.
    Although the FAA has taken steps in the right direction, such as 
upwardly adjusting its hiring goals for each of FY 2024-2026 to 1,800 
new hires, a protracted shutdown would cause immediate and irreparable 
harm to the FAA's near-term plans to address controller staffing. At 
minimum, the FAA's training academy in Oklahoma City discontinues 
operations during a shutdown and the students are sent home, while new 
classes of controller trainees in the pipeline will have their start-
dates significantly delayed, leading to additional attrition among the 
scheduled new hires.
    Even before the current funding uncertainty began, according to the 
FAA's Controller Workforce Plan, 40% of those who were members of a 
hiring class between 2014 and 2017 were removed from the FAA, resigned, 
or are still in training, meaning FAA can only expect about 60% of 
controller trainees to reach full certification within five to seven 
years of their hire. As a result, because it takes between one and 
three years for a new FAA Academy graduate to reach full certification, 
an increased hiring goal would take several years to have any positive 
effect on CPC totals. If the Academy is closed and hiring stops, the 
FAA's CPC shortage will become even more pronounced for the next five 
to seven years.
    A lapse in authorization or appropriations certainly would not be 
the first major disruption that has harmed controller staffing levels. 
In 2013, across-the-board spending cuts as a result of Sequestration 
forced the FAA to institute a hiring freeze and shutter the FAA Academy 
between March and December of that year. This came at a time in which 
the FAA was struggling to replace retiring controllers, and the Agency 
has never made up for that sequester-related hiring freeze. In fact, in 
its 2013-22 Controller Workforce Plan, FAA stated to Congress that it 
planned to hire 1,315 controller trainees in 2013 and 1,263 in 2014. 
Yet, when it hired only 554 controller trainees in 2013, missing its 
target by over 700 because of sequestration, the following year it only 
amended its 2014 hiring target to 1,286 adding merely 23 additional new 
trainees--a goal it missed by over 170.

 Note: Annual hires and losses are a relatively small proportion of the 
 total controller workforce. Forecast does not include the effects of 
                             sequestration.

      Workforce 2013-22, Chapter 3: Staffing Requirements, at 13.

    It's also important to note that in 2013, FAA projected essentially 
a flat total headcount including CPCs and trainees over the next 
decade. Instead, it immediately missed even that modest pace in 2013, 
hovered between 700-800 below that goal for much of the decade, and 
then once COVID-19 began, fell about 1,400 behind.
    But, if you go back further to the 2009 CWP, the same table showed 
targets of significantly more hiring and total on-board headcount of 
between 15,365 to 15,692 for each year over the next decade.

     Workforce 2009-2018, Chapter 3: Staffing Requirements, at 12.

    Sequestration also forced the FAA to issue a ``save money 
furlough'' affecting every employee, including air traffic controllers. 
During the week of April 21-27, 2013, delays nearly tripled at our 
nation's airports, from 5,103 to 13,694, when compared to the same week 
the year before and the year after.
    Then, again, in late Sept. 2013, because Congress had not passed 
appropriations bills to fund the government for FY 2014, the government 
was forced to shut down for 16 days shuttering much of the FAA along 
with it, which resulted in furloughs to FAA employees. The Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) estimates that these furloughs cost the 
government a total of $2.5 billion.
    In early 2018, Congress and the White House failed--on two separate 
occasions--to enact funding legislation and the government was shut 
down for three days between Jan. 20-22, and then again on Feb. 9. On 
March 23, Congress narrowly avoided its third federal government 
shutdown in a two-month period when it passed an omnibus spending 
package that funded the government and extended FAA authorization 
through Sept. 30, 2018. Prior to that, Congress was on its fifth 
consecutive CR and fifth consecutive extension to FAA authorization.
    From Dec. 2018 through Jan. 2019, the NAS suffered through the 
longest government shutdown in U.S. history, exacerbating a controller 
staffing crisis that continued to go from bad to worse.
    By the 2019-2028 CWP, FAA Finance had long abandoned its goals of 
approximately 15,500 total on-board headcount including CPCs and 
trainees from a decade earlier and even abandoned the total on-board 
headcount including CPCs and trainees from 2013 of approximately 
14,800. Without justification or explanation, it had adjusted that 
target all the way down to under 14,000. What prompted this reduced 
staffing target? Only FAA Finance can answer that question, but you 
won't find it in any CWP. Instead, you only will find justification for 
a new headcount number each year, because presumably FAA Finance 
assumes Congress will not compare past CWPs or notice its consistent 
failure to meet its stated hiring targets and goals.

    Fourteen months later, the COVID-19 Pandemic forced the FAA to 
close its training Academy again and, even after it reopened, 
enrollment capacity was reduced by 50% to maintain health and safety 
protocols.
    Although FAA reduced its hiring goals in three different years 
(2013, 2019, and 2021) reacting to a major disruption, the Agency 
curiously chose not to increase its hiring goals in the following year 
even though it has significantly more capacity at the Academy to do so. 
See Staffing Fact Sheet (Appendix B).
    A longitudinal review of FAA's CWPs from 2009 through 2021 reveals 
that FAA Finance has always projected that FAA only needs approximately 
the same number of controllers that it has at that moment in time 
(Appendix C). As it consistently missed its hiring targets and 
otherwise failed to keep up with attrition, the on-board controller 
number has decreased throughout that time. FAA Finance consistently 
said it only needs the new, lower controller headcount number each year 
and looking forward over the next decade. The long-term effect of this 
practice has led to the FAA's current state: an untenable one in which 
many controllers work mandatory 10-hour days, and six-day workweeks. 
Those requirements are based on a system that FAA Finance created of 
its own device. And, it's one they most likely would have continued but 
for the scrutiny of this Subcommittee in recent years.
    By 2022, after the staffing attrition due to the pandemic, FAA 
finally acknowledged it needed more controllers and reset its long-term 
target by 2031 back to 14,739, essentially what it said FAA needed back 
in 2012. But, having never reached its prior targets and only driving 
those numbers down year after year after year, NATCA and this 
Subcommittee have no guarantee that FAA will maintain this new target 
for the remainder of the next decade, given its consistent practice to 
change its plan in each of the previous 15 years.

    Moreover, we know from the last shutdown that some of our most 
experienced controllers decided to retire, while others tendered their 
resignations well-short of their retirement age to meet their financial 
obligations and provide for their families. Cumulatively, these delays 
to controller training, early retirements, and unexpected attrition 
wreak havoc on controller staffing throughout the system.
    Recognizing that controller staffing is a major problem for the 
FAA, in Dec. 2022, then-Acting Administrator Billy Nolen directed the 
FAA's Air Traffic Organization (ATO) to restart the CRWG and partner 
with NATCA to collaboratively determine the number of CPCs needed to 
meet operational, statutory, and contractual requirements, including 
resources to develop, evaluate, and implement processes and initiatives 
affecting the NAS. In the weeks that followed, the parties diligently 
worked with the MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System 
Development to develop CPC operational staffing targets at each of 
FAA's 313 air traffic control facilities. The CRWG completed its work 
at the end of January and presented its report to the then-Acting 
Administrator and NATCA President in mid-February. The FAA has not yet 
adopted the jointly developed CRWG's CPC targets as the basis for its 
annual CWP to provide Congress and the aviation industry with a more 
complete and transparent view of FAA's operational workforce needs.
    We hope that new FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker will recognize 
the important collaborative work done by the FAA and NATCA and adopt 
the CRWG's targets, while dispensing with the failed FAA Finance model.
    As we highlighted above, the current CWP is flawed because it 
relies on a ``finance driven'' staffing model that the FAA uses to 
develop facility-by-facility staffing. That model, developed by FAA's 
Office of Finance and Management (AFN or FAA Finance) incorrectly 
combines CPCs and CPC-ITs (controllers who were fully certified at a 
previous facility but are ``in training'' and not yet fully certified 
at their new facility). The CWP also ignores existing CPC staffing 
targets that were developed nearly ten years ago, which the 
reconstituted CRWG report updated based on current needs. Most 
importantly, it rejects FAA's own Air Traffic Organization's analysis 
that the system is severely understaffed.
    The Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General (DOT 
OIG) issued a report in June that agreed with the CRWG's analysis. The 
DOT OIG's Audit Report AV2023035, titled ``FAA Faces Controller 
Staffing Challenges as Air Traffic Operations Return to Pre-Pandemic 
Levels at Critical Facilities'' concluded that ``while the United 
States has one of the safest air traffic systems in the world, the lack 
of fully certified controllers, operational supervisors, and traffic 
management coordinators pose a potential risk to air traffic 
operations.'' DOT OIG Audit Report at 18.
    Regarding controllers, the DOT IG wrote, ``FAA continues to face 
staffing challenges and lacks a plan to address them, which in turn 
poses a risk to the continuity of air traffic operations.'' DOT OIG 
Audit Report at 6 (emphasis added). For example, the DOT IG 
``determined that 20 of 26 (77 percent) critical facilities are staffed 
below the Agency's 85-percent threshold'' and that ``managers we 
interviewed at 16 of the 17 facilities likewise told us their 
facilities were not adequately staffed. For example, at several 
facilities, controllers were working mandatory overtime and 6-day work 
weeks to cover staff shortages.'' DOT OIG Audit Report at 5, 8.
    The FAA's National Airspace System Safety Review Team (SRT) report, 
issued earlier this month reinforces what NATCA has been saying about 
air traffic control staffing for a decade when it wrote that ``these 
issues are eroding the margin of safety and injecting risk into the 
system, and the ATO must take action to urgently address this staffing 
crisis.''
    The SRT found that controller staffing shortages lead to diminished 
air traffic capacity and inefficient operations. The SRT also found 
that overtime is at historically high levels, as a result of the 
staffing shortage, concluding that it introduces additional risk into 
the NAS.
    The SRT reinforced what the Department of Transportation Inspector 
General concluded in its audit issued this past June when it concluded, 
``FAA has made limited efforts to ensure adequate controller staffing 
at critical air traffic control facilities.''
    The SRT found that ``when retirements and other attrition is 
accounted for, the [FAA's] hiring plan produces a negligible 
improvement over today's understaffed levels, resulting in a net 
increase of fewer than 200 air traffic controllers by 2032. The [Air 
Traffic Organization] must determine staffing needs based on actual 
system needs rather than on Academy throughput and budgetary 
constraints.''
    Without rationale, in its 2023-32 CWP, FAA Finance revised its 
staffing targets upward after the CRWG issued its report. Not 
coincidentally, it also was after the T&I Committee and Senate Commerce 
Committee both introduced legislative language to require the FAA to 
adopt the CRWG targets as the basis for the CWP. Nevertheless, FAA 
Finance continued with its intentionally misleading blending of CPCs 
and CPC-ITs into one group, despite pending legislation that requires 
them to report both groups separately.
    As soon as Congress inevitably turns its attention to other 
pressing matters, NATCA is concerned that FAA Finance will begin 
lowering its targets again consistent with past practice.

   Air Traffic Control Workforce Plan 2023-2032, Chapter 3: Staffing 
                          Requirements, at 15.

    Referencing the above chart, notice that FAA Finance now believes 
it needs over 15,400 total headcount (not the 13,800 total headcount it 
thought it needed just a few years ago). This is the same total it 
needed, and had, in 2009, but the Agency won't be able to achieve those 
totals for probably another decade due to the failures of its finance-
driven staffing model.
    This is entirely disingenuous, because FAA has needed that many 
total controllers the entire time and FAA Finance intentionally reduced 
the targets every year until Congress was forced to intervene in recent 
years.
    Continuing to follow FAA Finance's hiring plan--constructed by a 
line of business that has no experience operating or managing the air 
traffic system--after more than a decade of missed goals, incorrect 
projections, and reduced expectations is a fool's errand.
   II. Cascading Delays to Critical Modernization and Infrastructure 
                 Programs Jeopardize Safety of the NAS
    Stop-and-go funding negatively affects critical modernization and 
infrastructure programs such as delaying development, testing, and 
implementation of new technologies, as well as delaying the sustainment 
and repair of existing safety-critical equipment. Delays to these types 
of programs have real world consequences.
    Each year, the NAS experiences hundreds of safety events such as 
wrong-surface landings and runway incursions. It is important to note 
that a shutdown of the FAA would significantly delay development, 
testing, and implementation of a new surface surveillance situational 
awareness tool that will help controllers identify and detect when and 
where aircraft and ADS-B equipped vehicles are on airport surfaces.
    Although it is still in its infancy of development, this 
situational awareness tool would fulfill a similar role as the Airport 
Surface Detection System-Model X (ASDE-X) and Airport Surface 
Surveillance Capability (ASSC) at airports that do not currently have 
any surface surveillance technology. However, unlike ASDE-X and ASSC, 
this tool would be limited only to visual indicators and will not 
include ``safety logic'' enhancements, which is the predictive software 
that alerts controllers and provides an audible alarm as soon as the 
safety risk is detected by the program.
    To draw a parallel to motor vehicle technology, these tools are 
similar to the differences in a car's blind spot warning system. Today, 
many cars have some form of blind spot detection system. Some systems 
provide a warning light, an audible alarm, and automatic collision 
assistance, while other systems simply provide a flashing light on a 
side mirror. Both systems help prevent vehicle accidents, and although 
one certainly provides more redundancy than the other, both are 
significantly safer than what drivers had access to prior to the first 
such system in 2001.
    As of today, only 44 airports across the NAS have either ASDE-X or 
ASSC, and despite being a recent technological upgrade, these programs 
are in a sustainment-only posture within the FAA. The FAA does not have 
the funding nor contractual capability to expand these programs to new 
facilities. As a result, the aviation industry, NATCA, and the FAA 
began working on the development and implementation of a situational 
awareness tool to help air traffic controllers mitigate these risks.
    The successful and timely implementation of this situational 
awareness tool likely will hinge on two factors: the availability of 
sufficient funding for this program, and an intentional acceleration of 
the FAA's acquisitions management process so that this tool can reach 
air traffic facilities sooner rather than later. Even if these 
formidable hurdles are cleared, the current timeline for first-facility 
installation is June 2024, at the earliest. Any delays to FAA 
authorization, funding disruptions, or budgetary shortfalls, including 
a flat Facilities and Equipment (F&E) budget due to a long-term 
Continuing Resolution, will delay this timeline significantly.
    Moreover, in the event of a delay to FAA authorization or further 
funding disruptions, the programs listed below will experience the 
following negative effects, just to name a few:
    <bullet>  En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM)--Testing and 
build deployment at air traffic facilities must be rescheduled, which 
will cause delays.
    <bullet>  Standard Terminal Automation Replacement (STARS)--
Deployment of a new wrong surface alerting tool know as Arrival Runway 
Verification (ARV) will be delayed.
    <bullet>  DataComm--Facility training at Jacksonville Center (ZJX) 
and Fort Worth Center (ZFW) would stop and additional classes would be 
necessary. Cleveland Center (ZOB) implementation would be delayed 
approximately 60 days.
    <bullet>  Enterprise Information Display Systems (E-IDS)--Software 
testing events must be delayed.
    <bullet>  Airspace--New instrument procedure development will be 
negatively affected, although the extent of the harm and the length of 
the delay will vary depending on each facility's ability to adjust to a 
new timeline.

    During a shutdown, work on Voluntary Safety Reporting Programs 
(VSRPs), which provide for critical communication between air traffic 
safety action program review teams and furloughed staff, is deferred, 
resulting in the inability to properly identify and mitigate safety and 
training deficiencies. The safety reporting program for NATCA 
represented engineers and service area support staff also does not 
operate; all work on existing reported safety issues and associated 
mitigation activities is suspended during a shutdown.
    The FAA is behind schedule and continues to suffer through 
budgetary shortfalls on many critical modernization and infrastructure 
programs. Over the past 14 years, the FAA's F&E budget has not kept 
pace with inflation. In FY 2009, the F&E budget was $2.942 billion. It 
subsequently was lower than that in each fiscal year through 2017, 
before it peaked at $3.3 billion in FY 2018. However, since then it has 
remained just above or below $3 billion. Estimating for a modest 2% 
average annual inflation rate over the last 14 years, the FAA's F&E 
budget should be over $3.8 billion based on its 2009 budget.
    This loss of spending and buying power for modernization and 
infrastructure programs forced FAA into a ``fix-on-fail'' model by 
requiring it to prioritize mandatory costs such as subscription 
services and leases, basic ATC facility sustainment, salaries, travel, 
and major support contracts, along with NAS system sustainment. This 
prioritization leaves little to no money for important programs such as 
ATC facility replacement, the NAS facility sustainment backlog, the NAS 
system sustainment backlog, NAS system improvements, radar and 
surveillance sustainment and replacement, and Air Route Traffic Control 
Center (ARTCC) and Terminal Radar Approach Control facility (TRACON) 
consolidation, just to name a few.
    NATCA was pleased to see the Biden Administration's budget request 
for $3.46 billion for F&E for FY 2024, which in addition to $1 billion 
from the Infrastructure and Jobs Act (IIJA) for facilities meets FAA's 
$4.5 billion need in FY 2024. We support the Senate's Transportation, 
Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) 
appropriations bill that would meet this need for the time being. We 
are concerned, however, because NATCA projects FAA's F&E budget will 
need to be increased between to $5.5 and $6 billion in the near future, 
and the IIJA funding will expire at the end of FY 2027.
    In the coming years, FAA also will face unprecedented technological 
challenges. The continued development and rapid proliferation of 
advanced air mobility, drones, and other new entrants could jeopardize 
NAS safety and efficiency if not integrated properly. NATCA must be 
involved in all discussions surrounding the safe and efficient 
integration of these programs.
         III. Negative Effects of a Shutdown on Aviation Safety
    We know first-hand the kind of irreparable harm that a shutdown 
would have on the NAS because we have experienced them numerous times 
over the past two decades. In only the past five years, we have 
experienced three government shutdowns, while enduring 19 additional 
threatened lapses in appropriations, four threatened lapses in FAA 
authorization, and a narrowly averted debt ceiling crisis this past 
summer. See Appendix A.
    For example, the 35-day government shutdown from Dec. 2018 through 
Jan. 2019 eroded critical layers necessary to support and maintain the 
safety of the NAS. When the longest shutdown in U.S. history finally 
ended, the NAS--as well as the frontline FAA workforce represented by 
NATCA--was on the verge of unravelling, as many programs that reduce 
risk and increase safety completely stopped.
    NATCA members work hard to mitigate distractions and reduce fatigue 
in our workforce, but shutdowns increase fatigue and create unnecessary 
distractions for controllers while they are working airplanes. The 
added pressure and stress that a shutdown introduces into the NAS is 
intense.
    During this lengthy shutdown, many air traffic controllers were 
understandably distracted because they were thinking about the shutdown 
and how they would struggle to pay their mortgages, car payments, and 
other household expenses. Federal employees are paid bi-weekly and by 
the time the shutdown ended, they had missed more than two-full pay 
periods of income. To earn income and take care of their families, in 
addition to performing their regular stressful duties of separating and 
sequencing traffic, some controllers also were driving an Uber or Lyft 
or waiting tables before and after their FAA shifts.
    Air traffic control is a complex, high-consequence occupation 
requiring multiple layers of safety processes and procedures (i.e., 
safety reporting, quality control, quality assurance, training) to 
ensure we deliver the highest level of safety to the flying public. 
Many of these supporting functions are suspended during a shutdown 
because they do not meet the criteria to continue operating during a 
lapse in appropriations. You would never ask a surgeon to perform a 
surgery without their surgical team. As such, you also should not ask 
controllers to perform their critical safety work without their support 
team.
    NATCA is extremely concerned about the negative and cumulative 
effects that a shutdown next year would have on the current controller 
staffing crisis and training challenges.
    Unlike air traffic controllers who continue to work without pay 
during a shutdown, NATCA also represents approximately 3,000 additional 
aviation safety professionals who would be furloughed, and whose 
critical safety work is not performed. For instance, NATCA represents 
FAA staff support specialists who work at air traffic control 
facilities to provide tactical, strategic, and administrative support 
for training; quality assurance/quality control of air traffic control 
and traffic management; manage and redesign airspace and air traffic 
control procedures; support operational automation, military 
operations, and air traffic safety management systems.
    NATCA also represents aircraft certification engineers, who assist 
in design, production approvals, and airworthiness certification of 
aircraft and their components, as well as aerospace engineers who 
design and construct critical infrastructure necessary for safe flight 
operations including air traffic control towers, radar maintenance and 
installation, navigational aids, and communications systems. These FAA 
employees are furloughed during a shutdown and are prohibited from 
completing their important work.
    Moreover, beyond the immediate harms to controller staffing and the 
frontline workforce, shutdowns also delay the implementation of 
critical modernization technology, as well as the sustainment and 
repair of existing safety-critical equipment. For instance, certain 
programs would experience significant negative effects because of a 
shutdown such as En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM), Standard 
Terminal Automation Replacement (STARS), DataComm, Enterprise 
Information Display Systems (E-IDS), and multiple airspace 
modernization efforts at individual facilities across the NAS. A 
shutdown also will significantly delay development, testing, and 
implementation of a new situational awareness tool that will help 
controllers identify, detect, and mitigate runway incursions on airport 
surfaces.
                             IV. Conclusion
    To enhance aviation safety, Congress must pass a long-term, 
comprehensive FAA Reauthorization bill by the end of the year that 
directs the FAA to adopt the CRWG operational staffing targets and 
provides for maximum hiring of air traffic controller trainees to meet 
those operational needs. It must also ensure that FAA addresses its 
backlog of equipment maintenance, repair, and replacement. Further, 
Congress must avoid another harmful government shutdown and ensure 
robust FAA funding levels, especially for the operations and F&E 
budgets, so that the FAA and NATCA can continue their critical safety 
and modernization work.
    We thank the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee and the 
Subcommittee on Aviation for its commitment to transparent controller 
staffing through the adoption of the CRWG CPC staffing targets in its 
FAA reauthorization bill and for the foresight to require controller 
``max hiring'' to accomplish these critical goals.
    NATCA looks forward to working members of this Committee, as well 
as all other Members of Congress who are off committee, aviation 
stakeholders, and the FAA to achieve these and many other mutually 
beneficial goals.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify.

    Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Mr. Santa, for being here. We know 
this is the beginning of a very busy period for you.
    Mr. Bradbury, you are recognized for 5 minutes, please.

 TESTIMONY OF PAUL BRADBURY, P.E., AIRPORT DIRECTOR, PORTLAND 
INTERNATIONAL JETPORT, ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF 
                       AIRPORT EXECUTIVES

    Mr. Bradbury. Good morning, and thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today on behalf of AAAE. It is truly an 
honor to be here.
    I serve as vice chair of AAAE's Federal Affairs Committee, 
and in my day job I lead the Portland International Jetport in 
Portland, Maine, a vibrant and growing small-hub airport. I 
have been at the airport, PWM, for more than 30 years, the last 
15 as airport director.
    First, I want to say thank you to the leaders and members 
of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for 
developing and passing meaningful bipartisan FAA 
reauthorization legislation through the House. Chairmen Graves 
and Graves and Ranking Members Larsen and Cohen deserve immense 
credit for their leadership. The overwhelming votes in 
committee and on the House floor are a testament to the strong 
consensus that exists for this important legislation.
    For airports, the House bill increases Federal investment 
after decades of static, authorized funding levels, and makes 
important programmatic changes. These investments will fund 
improvements from tarmacs to terminals, enhancing safety, 
modernizing airport facilities, and increasing capacity while 
reducing environmental impacts.
    With safety concerns on the forefront, I want to emphasize 
that additional AIP resources will help airports upgrade 
runways, taxiways, and lighting to mitigate runway incursions 
and enhance safety. These investments on the ground complement 
efforts in the bill to enhance capabilities in the skies by 
adding to the controller workforce and upgrading technology. 
Both are important and extremely necessary.
    We also appreciate your work to reduce redtape, promote 
small community air service, improve the Contract Tower 
Program, expand the aviation workforce, and protect the 
environment.
    Airport executives are encouraged by the action that the 
committee has taken, but we are concerned about the looming 
December 31st deadline for enacting a long-term FAA bill. The 
Nation's aviation system is too important to leave on autopilot 
or to interrupt funding and unnecessarily increase costs. The 
challenges that the current uncertainty creates are evident at 
my airport and others, with limited construction seasons and 
tight operational windows to complete projects.
    In Portland, we need to commence projects in early spring 
and complete them by the end of September. Even a small delay 
can postpone a project until the next construction season, 
since operationally we can't begin a project that won't be 
paved and ready for operation by the time paving plants close 
in the fall. This upcoming construction season is critical at 
Portland, as we are reconstructing our taxiway Alpha, the 
parallel taxiway for our primary runway that moves aircraft 
from the runways to our terminal apron. The project must start 
on time, and has not only a tight seasonal weather schedule, 
but a tight operational schedule due to our extremely busy 
summer tourism season. Already we are coordinating the project 
construction schedule with our airline partners, which must 
adjust their flight schedules and aircraft to accommodate the 
project.
    My taxiway project is an example of just one airport. It is 
not unique. There are many airports with similar critical 
airfield infrastructure projects that can't move forward 
without the certainty of funding availability. Ultimately, this 
means projects that improve system efficiency and safety could 
be deferred. Sadly, this is not the first time airports have 
been challenged by short-term extensions and continuing 
resolutions.
    I will be blunt. It is not cost effective, practical, or in 
some cases, even possible to construct a project based on 
funding uncertainty or based on arbitrary partial year 
allotments. It is hard to buy half an air rescue firefighting 
truck or use only half of our short construction season.
    Surprisingly, some of the largest expenses on our major 
airfield projects are startup costs, which amount to 15 to 20 
percent of overall costs. Our contractors must have their 
equipment, safety/security fencing/barriers, materials, and 
support facilities onsite and ready to go before construction 
begins. If the project is delayed, forcing contractors to 
remobilize in the next construction season, the costs are 
doubled. When you multiply these impacts across hundreds of 
airports, the effects are significant: increased costs, delayed 
or deferred projects, and numerous operational challenges.
    Mr. Chairman, the aviation industry is in a period of 
intense challenge and opportunity. We need long-term certainty 
to plan, prepare, and build projects that increase efficiency 
and enhance safety. Our passengers, users, and communities 
expect and deserve these necessary investments. We are grateful 
for your work toward that end and appreciate the opportunity to 
be here today. Thank you.
    [Mr. Bradbury's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
 Prepared Statement of Paul Bradbury, P.E., Airport Director, Portland 
International Jetport, on behalf of the American Association of Airport 
                               Executives
    Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Cohen, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to participate in this hearing 
on the consequences of delaying a long-term Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill. It is an honor for me to be 
with you today.
    My name is Paul Bradbury, and I am the Airport Director of the 
Portland International Jetport (PWM)--a vibrant and growing small hub 
commercial service airport in the largest city in the great state of 
Maine, affectionately known as ``Vacationland.'' We had almost 983,000 
enplanements in 2022. With increasing numbers of business and leisure 
passengers, especially during the busy summer travel season, we expect 
that our 2023 enplanements will total nearly 1.1 million and be in line 
with the record we set in 2019.
    I am testifying today on behalf of the American Association of 
Airport Executives (AAAE), where I proudly serve as a Vice Chair of the 
association's Federal Affairs Committee. AAAE is the world's largest 
professional organization representing individuals who manage and 
operate more than 875 public-use commercial and general aviation (GA) 
airports across the country.
    While I am eager to highlight some of the disruptions that 
temporary extensions of FAA programs have on my airport and others 
across the country, I would note that the National Airspace System 
Review Team recently issued a report that documents how unpredictable 
funding adversely impacts system safety and efficiency. It also 
highlights issues with air traffic controller staffing and the 
disruption to necessary equipment upgrades.
    The independent report points out that the start-and-stop funding 
``makes it extremely difficult for the FAA to effectively conduct long-
term business planning and execution.'' With traffic levels growing and 
operations becoming ever more complex across the national airspace 
system, Congress shouldn't be content to leave the FAA operating on 
autopilot or interrupt funding for critical programs especially while 
the agency and aviation stakeholders continue to focus on aviation 
safety.
    Unfortunately, repeated short-term FAA extensions have been the 
norm in recent years. The resulting funding disruptions are 
particularly hard on PWM and other airports in locations with short 
construction seasons, and I applaud this subcommittee's efforts to get 
an FAA reauthorization bill enacted into law as soon as possible. AAAE 
and airports across the country are eager to continue working with you 
to achieve that goal and to avoid disruptions in infrastructure 
investments and policy initiatives aimed at enhancing aviation safety, 
improving the passenger experience, and promoting increased efficiency 
across the aviation system.
   H.R. 3935, the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American 
                              Aviation Act
    Mr. Chairman, let me begin by commending and thanking you, Chairman 
Sam Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, Ranking Member Cohen, and members of 
the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for your outstanding 
work in crafting H.R. 3935, the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership 
in American Aviation Act, and for shepherding it through the House 
prior to the initial expiration of FAA programs on September 30. The 
fact that your bipartisan bill sailed through the full committee with 
unanimous approval and received overwhelming bipartisan support on the 
House floor is a testament to the determination and leadership of the 
committee.
    The FAA reauthorization bill is a shining example of how lawmakers 
can reach across the aisle, find common ground, and work together to 
produce strong, forward-looking, bipartisan legislation. The T&I 
Committee has a rich history of working collaboratively to develop and 
advance meaningful legislation. The leaders and members of the 
committee deserve immense credit and our gratitude for honoring that 
tradition and legacy.
    The legislation developed by this committee is strongly supported 
by the airport community and would benefit the entire aviation 
industry. After the House approved the measure in June, full committee 
Chairman Graves correctly pointed out that the legislation will improve 
``the safety of our system, our airport infrastructure, and the quality 
of service for passengers.''
    I completely agree with that summary and his further assessment 
that the legislation includes key provisions that will help address the 
shortage of pilots, air traffic controllers, mechanics, and other 
aviation workers. That's a top priority for the entire aviation 
industry and particularly for smaller commercial service airports that 
have experienced air service reductions due, in part, to the shortage 
of commercial airline pilots.
        Helping Commercial Service and General Aviation Airports
    Airport Infrastructure Funding: H.R. 3935 includes an extensive 
list of provisions to help commercial service and GA airports. AAAE and 
Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA) have made 
increasing funding for airport infrastructure projects one of our top 
priorities for the FAA bill. Airports appreciate that the House-passed 
measure proposes to increase annual Airport Improvement Program (AIP) 
funding from $3.35 billion to $4 billion annually and authorize $100 
million per year for supplemental AIP discretionary grants.
    Increasing AIP funding will help airports accommodate rising 
infrastructure needs, increase capacity, reduce airline delays, and 
improve the passenger experience for our customers. The FAA's latest 
National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) indicates that 
federal infrastructure investments will also allow airports to 
``enhance airfield safety and support the Agency's goal of reducing 
accidents, fatalities, and runway incursions.''
    At a time when Congress, the FAA, airports, and other aviation 
stakeholders are rightfully focused on addressing near misses and 
runway incursions, this federal investment will provide airports with a 
boost in annual AIP funding that will enhance aviation safety. Among 
other important upgrades and enhancements, additional AIP funding will 
help airports improve runways, taxiways, and lighting to reduce the 
chances of runway incursions.
    These critical investments on the ground at airports complement 
other provisions in the House bill that will enhance safety in the 
skies. A modest increase in traditional AIP funding will also reverse a 
longstanding trend of flat or reduced AIP authorization levels in 
recent years and acknowledge the enormous infrastructure needs that 
airports are facing.
    According to the NPIAS, airports have $62.4 billion in capital 
needs--or approximately $12.5 billion annually--over the next five 
years. Those estimates include projects that are eligible for funding 
under AIP and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. However, the overall 
capital need is significantly greater when you factor in other 
necessary infrastructure projects that aren't eligible for federal 
funding. The proposed AIP funding in the FAA reauthorization 
legislation along with the BIL resources will help airports meet some 
of those rising needs.
    The House bill also includes multiple AIP formula changes that 
would update the way the FAA distributes federal funds to commercial 
service and GA airports. These proposed formula changes combined with 
higher annual funding levels would help airports of all sizes and 
ensure that the AIP funding formula is keeping up with evolving 
financial needs.
    For instance, H.R. 3935 would reduce the so-called ``PFC turnback'' 
for large and medium hub airports. This proposal would allow larger 
commercial service airports that collect Passenger Facility Charges 
(PFCs) to keep a greater share of their annual AIP entitlements. The 
proposal comes at a time when airports have current and future PFC 
collections pledged to existing projects and are precluded from 
generating more local revenue for infrastructure projects due to the 
arbitrary and outdated federal cap on local PFCs.
    The House bill would also help smaller commercial service airports. 
Under the current AIP formula, the minimum entitlement for commercial 
service airports with more than 10,000 annual enplanements is $1 
million. The House-passed bill would increase that amount to $1.3 
million and eliminate the financial ``cliff'' for airports that fall 
below the 10,000-enplanement threshold. Both proposals would translate 
into more infrastructure funds for smaller commercial service airports.
    We commend you and your colleagues for including a GA title in the 
bill and for acknowledging the important role that the country's nearly 
3,000 nonprimary airports in the NPIAS play in the aviation industry. 
The House-passed bill proposes to help GA airports by proposing to 
increase the nonprimary entitlement from 20 percent to 25 percent of 
available AIP funds--a significant bump.
    Coupled with an increase in overall AIP funding, these two steps 
will help funnel more federal funds to GA airports that need additional 
assistance. These important airports are in communities across the 
country and serve many important purposes as AAAE highlighted in 
testimony before the committee earlier this year.
    Regulatory Reform: During consideration of the last FAA bill--H.R. 
302, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018--Congress expanded PFC 
streamlining provisions that previously had been available only to non-
hub airports to small, medium, and large hubs to help reduce the time 
it takes airports to navigate the PFC application process. 
Unfortunately, the FAA decided to apply the expedited procedures to 
only a narrow range of projects at those airports.
    Airports are pleased that H.R. 3935 would take corrective action 
and fulfil the intent of the previous FAA reauthorization bill by 
allowing airports of all sizes to ``file a notice of intent to impose a 
PFC rather than file an application to do so.'' This welcome provision 
would reduce unnecessary federal red tape and process requirements and 
dramatically speed up the time it takes airports to move forward with 
PFC-funded projects while lowering their overall costs.
    The previous FAA bill included another important regulatory change 
designed to give airports more control over nonaeronautical land that 
they purchased without federal funds. Rather than implementing the 
proposal as intended to remove federal intervention where it was not 
warranted and give airports more control over land procured on their 
own without federal assistance, the FAA has added new process 
requirements that have slowed project approvals. H.R. 3935 includes 
welcome language that would revisit this issue by prohibiting the 
Department of Transportation (DOT) from regulating the acquisition, 
use, lease, transfer, or disposal of property that airports purchased 
without federal funds except to ensure safety and efficiency and that 
fair market value is received.
    Airports are also pleased that the bill includes steps to reduce 
unnecessary red tape. For instance, the bill directs the FAA to take 
the lead on coordinating and scheduling the environmental review 
process with other federal agencies. And it increases the number of 
airport projects that are presumed to be covered by categorial 
exclusions. Both are reasonable steps to help prevent delays in 
critical safety and other airport infrastructure projects.
    Small Community and Workforce Development Programs: Small 
commercial service airports work hard to retain and attract commercial 
air service to ensure their communities have access to reliable air 
service. The House-passed bill authorizes funds for the Essential Air 
Service and Small Community Air Service--two longstanding programs 
designed to help airports in rural and less populated areas.
    We're also grateful that H.R. 3935 would take important steps to 
expand the aviation workforce. The measure would authorize $15 million 
annually for three Aviation Workforce Development Programs aimed at 
increasing the number of pilots, mechanics, and manufacturing workers.
    FAA Contract Tower Program: I would like to thank members of this 
committee for being strong supporters of the FAA Contract Tower (FCT) 
Program--a successful public private partnership that enhances aviation 
safety at GA and commercial service airports around the country. Both 
the House-passed bill and the pending Senate FAA reauthorization bill 
include welcome bipartisan proposals to address controller staffing and 
equipment needs at contract towers.
    The recent National Airspace System Review Team report highlights 
the air traffic controller staffing crisis and the impact it is having 
on our aviation system. The report mentions that ``the instability of 
the air traffic controller workforce in the FAA is also leading to 
increased instability at the FAA Contract Tower Program, which results 
in both greater churn and higher costs in these towers.''
    Both the House and Senate versions of the FAA reauthorization bill 
include provisions to help address the staffing challenges at contract 
towers. For instance, H.R. 3935 would require DOT to work with the 
Department of Labor to review the outdated wage determination for 
controllers who serve at contract towers. Controller wages have not 
kept up with inflation, and we believe this review would be a key step 
toward fixing that deficiency.
    The House-passed bill also calls on the DOT Inspector General to 
initiate an audit of the workforce needs of the FCT Program. The Senate 
version of the bill would go a step further by requiring DOT to 
coordinate with contractors to create air traffic controller training 
programs that would allow contractors to train certain controllers to 
stringent FAA standards.
    We strongly believe that these thoughtful proposals would help 
address staffing challenges at contract towers. They would also help 
enhance the pipeline of controllers who work at FAA-staffed facilities 
since so many younger contract tower controllers go on to work at 
larger airports. In other words, proposals that help improve staffing 
at contract towers ultimately help enhance staffing at FAA-staffed 
towers.
    The House and Senate bills would also take important steps to 
upgrade equipment in contract towers to increase situational awareness 
for controllers and enhance aviation safety. Considering the rise in 
operations at contract towers and the variety of commercial, private, 
student, and military pilots who use contract tower airports, it is 
critical that their towers have the same type of technology found in 
FAA-staffed towers.
    Environmental Initiatives: Finally, the legislation includes 
provisions to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and several 
initiatives to mitigate aircraft noise on local communities as AAAE and 
ACI-NA recommended. For instance, the bill would allow AIP funding to 
flow to environmental initiatives such as resiliency projections. It 
also proposes to expand the Voluntary Airport Low Emission program to 
all commercial service airports including those outside of non-
attainment areas. And it calls on the FAA to coordinate with the Army 
Corps of Engineers to examine the resiliency of coastal airports.
            Short-Term Extensions Adversely Impact Airports
    Mr. Chairman, I commend the House for passing its version of the 
FAA reauthorization bill well before the initial September 30 deadline. 
Although Congress has had to pass one short-term extension, I am 
hopeful that you and your Senate colleagues will be able to pass a 
final five-year reauthorization bill before the current extension 
expires on December 31.
    As you know, it took Congress three years and six short-term 
extensions before completing the previous FAA reauthorization bill in 
2018. Congress passed 23 separate, short-term extensions over four-and-
a-half years before it cleared the prior FAA reauthorization bill in 
2012. Those numerous stop-gap measures, coupled with partial FAA 
shutdowns, were disruptive to airport operators who routinely saw their 
AIP grants delayed because of prolonged uncertainty in Washington. 
(Attached is a list of FAA extensions during the last 20 years that was 
provided by the Eno Center for Transportation.)
    In previous years, the FAA has indicated that the agency needs one 
extension or multiple extensions with a duration of at least six months 
before the agency can begin distributing AIP entitlement grants to 
airports. And even with six months of authorization and appropriations 
in place, airports would only be eligible to receive a portion of their 
AIP entitlements early in the year.
    Previously, the FAA gave airports three options during these 
scenarios: 1) take their AIP grants based on prorated calculations; 2) 
wait and see if Congress passes a multi-year FAA reauthorization bill 
or more extensions to get through the fiscal year; or 3) declare their 
intention to defer or carryover their AIP entitlements. None of those 
options are particularly good choices for airports.
    With so many challenges facing airports and the entire aviation 
industry, we simply cannot afford to go through years of multiple 
short-term extensions. Repeated short-term extensions and FAA shutdowns 
make it exceptionally challenging for airport operators to plan and 
complete their capital projects. Funding uncertainty is particularly 
difficult on smaller airports and those with short construction 
seasons.
    Impacts on Portland International Jetport: Funding uncertainty is a 
particular challenge for PWM and other northern tier airports with 
limited construction seasons and tight operational windows to complete 
their projects. But other airports around the country are also impacted 
by annual weather constraints including those in the west located at 
high elevations and those in the southeast and other areas of the 
country impacted by hurricanes.
    In Portland, we need to start our pavement projects in early 
spring, typically in mid-May, and complete them by the end of September 
when the weather worsens. With such a tight operational window, even a 
small delay could force us to postpone a project until the next 
construction season in the following year. We are unable to start a 
paving project in Portland that can't be completed and ready for 
operation by the time our nearby paving plants close in the fall. The 
postponement of any paving project affects the operational efficiency 
of the airport, delays necessary safety enhancements, and dramatically 
increases our costs.
    Some of the largest expenses tied to a major airfield project are 
startup costs related to mobilization, safety, and security measures, 
which can amount to 15 to 20 percent of the overall cost. For instance, 
contractors work to have all their equipment, safety/security fencing/
barriers, materials, and support facilities on site, installed, and 
ready to go before the actual airport construction project begins. But 
if a construction project is delayed and contractors are forced to 
remobilize in the next construction season these startup costs are 
doubled.
    Next year is a critical construction season for PWM since we are 
planning to reconstruct our taxiway A. This is the parallel taxiway for 
our primary runway 11/29 that moves aircraft from the runways to our 
terminal apron. We must start this $13.3 million project on time 
because we have a tight seasonal weather schedule and a narrow 
operational timeline due to our extremely busy summer tourism season, 
which runs from June to October. With construction slated to begin 
early next year, we are already coordinating with our airline partners 
so they can adjust their May flight schedules and move equipment to 
accommodate the project.
    PWM's taxiway project is just one project at one airport that could 
be impacted by funding delays. But it is not unique. There are many 
airports across the country with similar critical projects that can't 
move forward without funding certainty. At the end of the day, a series 
of short-term FAA extensions mean that airport capital projects that 
improve our national aviation system's efficiency and enhance aviation 
safety will be delayed or deferred.
    From past experiences I know it is not cost effective, practical, 
or in some cases even possible to construct a project based on funding 
that is administered in partial year allotments. As you can imagine, 
airports are unable to use a portion of their AIP funding to purchase 
half of an Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting vehicle. And it's hard for 
airports to construct their infrastructure projects with only half of 
an already short construction season. That is why it critical that 
Congress pass a long-term FAA reauthorization as quickly as possible 
and remove the uncertainty surrounding AIP funding.
                           Price of Inaction
    The impacts I described above are just some of the reasons why a 
series of short-term extensions is bad for airports like PWM that are 
trying to plan and complete airfield and other infrastructure projects. 
But there is the price of inaction, too. I already mentioned some of 
the provisions in the House-passed bill that will help airports meet 
their infrastructure needs and improve their facilities. But those 
proposals will sit on the sidelines until a final FAA reauthorization 
bill is enacted into law.
    One of the top issues facing the aviation industry today is the 
shortage of aviation workers. Unfortunately, proposals in the House-
passed bill to help increase the pipeline of pilots, controllers, and 
aerospace workers will also be stuck in neutral until a final bill is 
cleared. The changes that lawmakers have proposed to enhance aviation 
safety, including those aimed at improving safety at contract tower 
airports, will be delayed until the FAA reauthorization bill is 
completed.
    This year, the FAA and the aviation industry have witnessed an 
uncharacteristic rise of near misses and runway incursions across the 
National Airspace System. AAAE has joined with FAA and National 
Transportation Safety Board officials for discussions about the 
challenges the aviation industry is facing and the actions that are 
necessary to ensure that our system continues to operate safely.
    The aviation system is in a period of intense challenge and 
opportunity. We have new workers and leaders, new entrants that are 
fundamentally changing our aviation system, and new products and 
technologies that can help reduce the impacts of aviation on the 
environment. But during this time of rapid change, we need stability 
and long-term certainty to carry out our traditional and future 
missions. Passing a multi-year FAA reauthorization bill before the 
current extension expires at the end of the year would help us secure 
that much-needed predictability.
    Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Cohen, and members of the 
subcommittee thank you again for inviting me to participate in today's 
hearing and thank you for the work you have done to advance a 
bipartisan multi-year FAA reauthorization bill. Like my colleagues at 
airports around the country, I look forward to working with you and 
your Senate counterparts to ensure that the next FAA reauthorization 
bill is enacted into law as soon as possible so we can meet the 
challenges ahead and avoid unnecessary disruptions and delays.

    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Bradbury.
    Mr. Peterson, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.

   TESTIMONY OF GARY PETERSON, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TRANSPORT 
                    WORKERS UNION OF AMERICA

    Mr. Peterson. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Graves, 
Ranking Member Cohen, and members of the subcommittee. Thank 
you very much for holding this hearing today on the importance 
of reauthorizing the FAA administration as quickly as possible.
    I am Gary Peterson, executive director of the Transport 
Workers Union of America. Our members include over 155,000 
transportation workers across the country. We are the largest 
union in the U.S. aviation industry, and we represent 
mechanics, flight attendants, ramp workers, dispatchers, fleet 
service workers, pilots, simulator instructors, meteorologists, 
and others who safely deliver people and goods to their final 
destination every day.
    On behalf of the entire TWU, I want to start by applauding 
the committee's diligent and collaborative efforts to pass H.R. 
3935, the 2023 FAA reauthorization. Your legislation includes a 
number of historic provisions the TWU has been advocating for 
for over decades. Our union has strongly endorsed H.R. 3935, 
and we hope to see it swiftly enacted into law.
    The provisions of your legislation are not only historic, 
but urgently needed. Every day that the FAA continues to run on 
a short-term extension is another day that our members face 
assault, unsafe work conditions, and impossible economic 
conditions that are incentivizing companies to offshore good 
aviation maintenance jobs.
    Since the late 1980s, the FAA has outrageously encouraged 
airlines to perform their maintenance outside the United States 
by selectively enforcing safety regulations. Today, there are 
nearly 1,000 FAA certified repair stations abroad. It is at 
best disingenuous, and more often an outright lie, when 
airlines tell the FAA or the flying public that they maintain 
the highest maintenance standards. The truth is that no one has 
insight into the work performed at many of these facilities 
outside the U.S. There are no random inspections, no minimum 
qualifications for mechanics, and absolutely no expectation 
that the work is being done to U.S. standards.
    China has been the largest beneficiary of this lack of 
enforcement, and now employs nearly 22,000 workers at 
facilities repairing and overhauling U.S. aircraft, roughly the 
same amount of aviation maintenance workers as the States of 
California and Texas combined. This is work that absolutely 
should be done on U.S. soil by qualified U.S. workers.
    H.R. 3935 would close these loopholes and reiterate 
existing FAA standards. Your legislation requires companies 
abroad that request the rights and privileges associated with 
an FAA certification also meet U.S. standards. This provision 
will return thousands of good jobs to the U.S. and raise the 
level of safety in our airspace.
    On this subcommittee, the TWU particularly appreciates the 
work of Representatives Marc Molinaro and Julia Brownley, who 
led this fight on the issue in this Congress.
    Additionally, H.R. 3935 will save airline workers' lives. 
For customer-facing airline workers, violent and unruly 
passengers have become all too common. While the number of 
formerly reported cases of unruly passengers has dropped since 
its peak in calendar year 2021, 2023 is on pace to record 
nearly 2,000 incidents of unruly behavior in our air system, a 
63-percent increase over 2019. H.R. 3935 takes meaningful steps 
to end the threat of assault on airline workers, including 
updates to employer assault prevention and response plans. 
Although the bill could take stronger action in preventing 
these assaults, there is no doubt that the legislation will 
reduce the number and severity of assaults on ground workers 
and flight attendants.
    The situation on airport ramps is even more dire. Early 
this year, the TWU mourned the tragic loss of Michal Ingraham, 
an American Airlines ramp worker who was crushed by a 
malfunctioning ramp service vehicle that pinned him to a jet 
bridge at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. This tragedy 
was the result of a failure on all levels, including that of 
the FAA. Ramp workers like Michal are often invisible to the 
public. Sadly, three other workers, ramp workers, have also 
died in this past year alone, including one just this last 
month.
    It has been far too long since these rules keeping these 
workers safe have been reviewed and updated. H.R. 3935 mandates 
the FAA issue a call to action to review ramp worker safety 
procedures, bring stakeholders to address longstanding 
deficiencies in FAA policy, update training programs, and 
increase visibility for safety markings. For ground workers, 
these changes cannot come soon enough.
    My written testimony details the many ways H.R. 3935 will 
immediately improve safety and worker rights in our airspace. I 
again applaud your work by directly tackling all of the major 
issues facing airline workers today. It is significant that 
your legislation earned the unanimous vote of this full 
committee and an overwhelming vote on the House floor. Our 
members are proud to support the House version of the FAA 
reauthorization.
    Thank you again for holding this hearing, and I look 
forward to answering any questions.
    [Mr. Peterson's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
  Prepared Statement of Gary Peterson, Executive Director, Transport 
                        Workers Union of America
    Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Cohen, and members of the House 
Subcommittee on Aviation, thank you very much for holding this hearing 
on the importance of reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA). Airline workers generate 5% of our nation's economy and ensure 
that our airspace remains the safest form of transportation in the 
world. It is critical that Congress reauthorize the FAA immediately to 
enable these workers to continue their essential work.
    My name is Gary Peterson, and I am the Executive Director of the 
Transport Workers Union of America (TWU). The TWU represents more than 
155,000 members across the country. We are the largest union in the 
U.S. airline industry and I am here today representing airline 
mechanics, flight attendants, ramp workers, dispatchers, fleet service 
workers, pilot simulator instructors, meteorologists, and others who 
safely enable people and packages to move around the world. I 
appreciate the opportunity to address this committee today and to share 
our concerns about several ongoing issues which threaten the safety and 
security of our airspace--all of which are directly addressed as part 
of the FAA reauthorization legislation which advanced unanimously from 
this committee and was overwhelmingly approved by the full House.
    The TWU applauds the diligent and collaborative efforts from this 
committee to draft and pass H.R. 3935, the Securing Growth and Robust 
Leadership in American Aviation Act. We worked closely with you and 
your staff on a full, five-year reauthorization of the FAA that 
acknowledges the roles our members play to make our airspace safe and 
allow for a well-functioning air transportation system. We, alongside 
dozens of other national organizations, have enthusiastically endorsed 
that legislation because it takes bold, intentional action to address 
the current problems in our air system and sets out a clear path to 
grow good, union jobs in the industry going forward. It is a great 
piece of legislation that we believe should be enacted into law 
immediately.
    The FAA is currently running on a short-term extension that expires 
on New Year's Eve--just four weeks away. Every day that the FAA 
continues to maintain the status quo is another day that our members, 
the rest of the aviation workforce, and the traveling public are forced 
to continue to deal with a litany of problems, not because the problems 
are intractable but due to the Senate's inaction. We join the House in 
calling on the Senate to fulfill its duty in passing an FAA 
reauthorization bill--ideally, a bill substantially similar to H.R. 
3935.
    H.R. 3935 includes a number of historic provisions which the TWU 
has been advocating for over decades.
       H.R. 3935 will return airline maintenance jobs to the U.S.
    Every Congress since 1986 has introduced legislation to address the 
threat of offshoring aircraft maintenance. Air carriers have 
increasingly moved heavy maintenance work out of the country, choosing 
to have their aircraft maintained, repaired, and overhauled at any of 
the almost 1,000 FAA-certified repair stations abroad instead of at one 
of the nearly 4,000 such stations here at home. Alarmingly, the Chinese 
Communist Party is the principal beneficiary of the FAA's 
certification, employing more than 7% of the global workforce 
repairing, maintaining, and overhauling U.S. aircraft.
    Current government practice incentivizes airlines to move this work 
out of the U.S. Despite issuing identical certificates with the same 
set of privileges to all of the repair stations it oversees globally, 
the FAA does not hold repair stations outside of the country to the 
same safety standards as those in the U.S. The result is significant 
cost-savings on compliance and risk when the work is done abroad, 
effectively directing the airlines to offshore thousands of jobs going 
back decades.
    While the FAA nominally requires that all repair stations, 
regardless of location, maintain aircraft to the same standard, foreign 
repair stations do not have to comply with several requirements to 
which U.S.-based maintenance facilities are held, including:
    <bullet>  Mandatory security background checks for workers;
    <bullet>  Risk-based safety and security evaluations for 
facilities;
    <bullet>  Employee drug and alcohol testing;
    <bullet>  Unannounced FAA inspections; and
    <bullet>  FAA certification standards for maintenance technicians 
and support personnel

    TWU members and others in the aviation workforce have seen 
firsthand the consequences of the lack of evenhanded regulations. Their 
discoveries include:
    <bullet>  Critical engine components held together with tape and 
wire;
    <bullet>  Parts on the aircraft exterior doors installed 
incorrectly, resulting in mid-flight cabin depressurization;
    <bullet>  Aircraft covered with flammable paint; and
    <bullet>  Drugs hidden behind panels in aircraft wheel wells, 
avionics bays, cargo compartments and lavatory walls

    H.R. 3935 would close these loopholes, raising the level of safety 
in our airspace and returning good mechanic jobs to the U.S. Every day 
that goes by under the current non-enforcement regime is pushing more 
work out of the country. Completing work on H.R. 3935 would immediately 
return some of these jobs and begin a long-term process to restore U.S. 
leadership to aircraft maintenance. The TWU appreciates Representatives 
Marc Molinaro and Julia Brownley for leading the fight on the House 
side to return these jobs in the 118th Congress.
            H.R. 3935 will help protect workers from assault
    For customer-facing airline workers, violent, unruly passengers 
have become all too common, threatening worker safety. Videos and 
stories of airline workers being physically or verbally assaulted for 
doing their jobs have become a regular feature in the media, with many 
more incidents going undocumented. While the number of formally 
reported cases of unruly passengers has gone down since its peak in 
calendar year 2021, when commercial air travel picked up significantly 
after its COVID-induced nadir, the number of cases is still well above 
pre-COVID levels; so far in 2023, the FAA has received 1,820 reports of 
unruly passengers; in 2019, the agency received 1,161 reports. This 
issue is not going away on its own.
    In light of these troubling trends, aviation workers have proposed 
a number of solutions, including a no-fly list and mandatory crew self-
defense training. H.R. 3935 takes meaningful steps to end the threat of 
assault on airline workers, including updates to employer assault 
prevention and response plans. Although the bill could take stronger 
action to prevent these assaults, we have no doubt that the provisions 
of this bill will reduce the number and severity of assaults in our air 
system. Workers will see none of the benefit of these changes, however, 
until these provisions are enacted into law.
               H.R. 3935 will prevent ramp worker deaths
    Earlier this year, the TWU mourned the tragic loss of one of our 
members: Michal Ingraham, a 37-year-old man of faith who worked at 
Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. Michal was performing his 
duties safely when his service vehicle malfunctioned, slamming on the 
gas, jumping its brakes, and crushing Michal into a concrete column of 
the jet bridge. His body was pinned for several hours. Powerless to do 
anything, his coworkers had to continue working scheduled flights at 
other gates and had to see this gruesome scene. Just last month, an 
airport employee was struck by a fuel truck and pronounced dead at the 
scene. Two other ramp workers have also died recently after being 
ingested by jet engines. All of their deaths are tragedies that we all 
mourn.
    Ramp workers are often invisible to the public; their work is 
performed under the wing and in secure areas of the airport out of view 
from travelers. As a result, it has been far too long since the rules 
keeping these workers safe have been reviewed and updated. H.R. 3935 
mandates the agency to issue a Call-to-Action safety review of ramp 
worker safety, bringing together stakeholders with the goal of 
assessing deficiencies in FAA policies, training programs, and safety 
markings. A delay in getting this bill passed risks unnecessarily 
endangering the lives of ground workers across the country who rely on 
the adequacy of their employers' training programs.
            H.R. 3935 will end unsafe dispatching practices
    Qualified, well-trained, and highly focused aircraft dispatchers 
play a key role in ensuring the safety of our air traffic system, as 
evidenced by their bringing every plane in the national airspace to an 
emergency landing in mere hours following the terrorist attacks on 9/
11. Concerningly, as employers across industries began to implement 
work-from-home policies in response to the spread of COVID, the FAA 
authorized two airlines--Republic Airways and SkyWest--to allow their 
dispatchers to maintain operational control of flights from mobile 
workstations--that is, away from secure facilities in the airline's 
operations center. While the FAA originally allowed only 20 percent of 
dispatchers during any shift to dispatch remotely, months later it 
increased the authorization to 60 percent, all without any conditions 
or assurances that this change in a tried-and-true system of work would 
meet FAA standards. Dispatching from home raises significant safety 
concerns, ranging from outside distractions, lack of random and 
reasonable-suspicion drug and alcohol testing to data overloading home 
networks.
    H.R. 3935 explicitly prohibits air carriers from dispatching 
aircraft from any location that is not a designated dispatch or flight 
following center, putting an end to FAA's troubling and continuing 
authorization of dispatching from home. Today, under the short-term 
extension, air carriers can--and undoubtedly will--continue to take 
advantage of the status quo and allow their dispatchers to maintain 
operational control in less secure environments.
                   H.R. 3935 will clean up cabin air
    The quality of cabin air circulated inflight has long been of 
concern for TWU members. To create breathable air 40,000 feet above sea 
level, aircraft pull air from the surrounding atmosphere, heat it over 
the engines, compress it, and circulate it into the cabin--a process 
known as bleed air. When the mechanical pieces of this process 
malfunction, contaminants can be introduced, pumping toxic air into the 
cabin for passengers and crewmembers to breathe. Despite this alarming 
reality, the FAA requires shockingly minimal training, reporting, or 
correcting of these incidents.
    When gasified, engine oil, hydraulic fluid, fuel, and other 
aircraft fluids become potent nerve agents that can cause respiratory, 
neurological, and psychiatric symptoms, as well as cancer. These nerve 
agents can be absorbed both by inhalation and contact with skin. 
Repeated or prolonged exposure to these agents--such as that endured by 
flight attendants--can have devastating health effects. We have 
documented cases of TWU flight attendants who have suffered both severe 
and career-ending disabilities due to this chemical exposure.
    Passengers, too, are at equal risk of the negative health effects 
from the fumes caused by bleed air. Because these fumes can smell like 
dirty socks or other everyday items, travelers may not recognize the 
health threat as it is happening. In fact, some passengers mistake the 
symptoms of toxic fume exposure for jet lag.
    H.R. 3935 requires the FAA to create a system for inflight crew and 
mechanics to report fume events on board commercial aircraft while 
safeguarding submitting parties' information should an air carrier 
request details on a reported fume event. Additionally, the bill 
mandates a study of the occurrence of fume events and subsequent 
issuance of recommendations to improve cabin air quality. As a direct 
consequence of unnecessary delay in the long-term reauthorization of 
the FAA, however, inflight crew and the flying public will continue to 
deal with fume events and the lingering health effects.
      H.R. 3935 supports the next generation of good aviation jobs
    The TWU believes that advanced air mobility (AAM) has the potential 
to create a new mode of transportation. Such an innovation, however, 
must be carefully reviewed and overseen by regulators in order to 
ensure both that it will be safe and it will benefit our economy 
through the creation of good jobs. Regulators must hold new entrants in 
the national airspace system to the same level of safety that we expect 
from existing stakeholders and ensure that workers are prioritized in 
the development and implementation of policies affecting AAM. The TWU 
strongly believes the maintenance and dispatching standards that govern 
commercial airlines should be applied to AAM operators. Additionally, 
regulators must contend with how AAM comports with existing labor 
standards at legacy transit modes--chiefly, public transportation and 
commuter rail lines--in communities where this new technology seeks to 
penetrate the market.
    The TWU applauds the House for the thoughtful approach to AAM. This 
language stands in stark contrast to Senate proposals that would 
empower new entrants at the expense of safety and workers. H.R. 3935 
will not be the last piece of legislation Congress considers on AAM, 
but it is the appropriate legislation that workers need now to prepare 
for the next generation of flight. We will continue to advocate for 
robust regulatory guardrails that guarantee the nation's continued 
leadership in aviation and protect jobs and hard-fought labor 
standards.
  H.R. 3935 reestablishes the clear right of states and localities to 
                       establish labor standards
    In states and localities across the country, air carriers are 
actively fighting to exclude their workers from labor laws. These laws 
governing minimum wage rates, meal and rest breaks, family and medical 
leave have long been understood to be state issues. Airlines have 
invented an anti-worker argument that has been rejected by nearly every 
court where it has been raised. As a result, they turned to Congress to 
attempt to overturn half a century of precedent. H.R. 3935 firmly 
rejects this effort and solidifies the right of airline workers to 
benefit from state and local labor laws.
    Exempting airline workers from state and local labor laws would 
significantly dampen efforts to recruit new mechanics, dispatchers, 
ramp workers, and flight attendants who would not be able to rely on 
the benefits that are enshrined in state and local statute for workers 
in every other industry. In many localities, were the airlines' 
proposal enacted into law, airline work would instantly become sub-
minimum wage work. It would instantly cause a mass exodus of workers 
moving to every other job in an area that guaranteed health care, sick 
leave, and other state-level benefits. Rejecting this proposal has not 
only saved the current generation of airline workers from poverty, but 
has also ensured that there will be a next generation of airline 
workers.
          Airline workers need H.R. 3935 enacted into law now
    We know the solutions to the well-documented problems affecting 
aircraft mechanics, ground workers, flight attendants, customer service 
agents, dispatchers, and other airline employees. In many cases, we 
have known these solutions for years. H.R. 3935 is a bold piece of 
legislation that enacts these solutions. A fully reauthorized FAA with 
the powers, authorities, and direction included in H.R. 3935, will 
provide certainty to the industry, equip the agency with the policy 
tools necessary to ensure the safety and economic well-being of our air 
system, and prepare airline workers for the next generation of American 
leadership in the aviation industry.
    Short-term extensions are anathema to all of these goals. While it 
may be politically expedient to continue to extend the FAA's existing 
authority, neither airline employees nor the traveling public stand to 
gain from the status quo. Once again, the TWU greatly appreciates the 
House of Representatives for its diligent work in passing an FAA bill 
earlier this year. We join you in calling on the Senate to finish its 
work and get a bill--ideally H.R. 3935--to the President's desk.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify before the subcommittee on 
these important issues. The TWU looks forward to continuing to work 
with the committee to advance policies that will improve workers' 
safety and well-being in the airline industry and beyond.

    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Peterson.
    Mr. Cohen. I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record 
the following: a letter from members of the Federal Aviation 
Administration's Management Advisory Council in their personal 
capacity from November 27, 2023; a letter from Airlines for 
America, November 29, 2023; a letter from Aerospace Industries 
Association from November 29 of this year; a letter from 
associations representing the general aviation industry from 
November 30 of this year; a letter from Reliable Robotics from 
November 30 of this year; and a letter from the American 
Society of Travel Advisors, all supporting the timely passage 
of a long-term and comprehensive authorization.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Without objection, so ordered.
    [The information follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
   Letter of November 27, 2023, to Hon. Charles E. Schumer, Majority 
  Leader, and Hon. Mitch McConnell, Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, and 
   Hon. Mike Johnson, Speaker, and Hon. Hakeem S. Jeffries, Minority 
 Leader, U.S. House of Representatives, from Private-Sector Members of 
  FAA's Management Advisory Council, Submitted for the Record by Hon. 
                              Steve Cohen
                                                 November 27, 2023.
The Honorable Chuck Schumer,
Majority Leader,
United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510.
The Honorable Mitch McConnell,
Minority Leader,
United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510.
The Honorable Mike Johnson,
Speaker,
United States House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Hakeem Jeffries,
Minority Leader,
United States House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
    Dear Senator Schumer, Senator McConnell, Speaker Johnson, and 
Representative Jeffries:
    We are private sector members of the Federal Aviation 
Administration's Management Advisory Council (MAC), established by 
Congress to provide guidance to the FAA about critical aviation issues. 
Appointed by the Secretary of Transportation, our members have years of 
experience in virtually all aviation sectors. We are, however, writing 
this letter in our personal capacities.
    We commend the strong, bipartisan vote in the Senate to confirm 
Mike Whitaker as FAA Administrator. Given our involvement with the MAC, 
we call to your attention the urgent need for Congress to act upon 
legislation to reauthorize the FAA and approve a FY2024 appropriations 
that fully funds the agency at the President's requested level before 
the end of 2023 to give Administrator Whitaker the tools to support his 
and the agency's efforts.
    Congress has held numerous hearings this year on the many 
challenges facing the FAA, and the House-passed FAA Reauthorization 
bill and the version pending before the Senate Commerce Committee 
address many of these. These include a focus on addressing critical 
aviation safety issues such as air traffic controller staffing, runway 
incursions, and cybersecurity, as well as investments in airports and 
improvements to the agency's regulatory and certification processes and 
aging air traffic infrastructure. Finally, both bills address critical 
efforts to advance the FAA's and industry's workforce and enhance the 
FAA's standing internationally as well as U.S. industry efforts to 
remain global leaders in aviation safety and innovation.
    We were hopeful that Congress would enact reauthorization 
legislation well before the 2018 law expired. We were also hopeful that 
the repeated threat of a government shutdown would be avoided.
    During the last government shutdown, FAA's air traffic controllers 
and aviation safety inspectors worked without pay. And while they 
eventually received backpay, we remain very concerned with the added 
stress and distraction that working without a paycheck will place on 
them and their families. This is compounded by the fact that current 
air traffic controller staffing is woefully inadequate (over 1,000 
fewer than a decade ago) and they are now being asked to work 10-hour 
shifts, six days a week. National Transportation Safety Board Chair 
Jennifer Homendy raised these fatigue concerns for controllers and 
other aviation workers in her recent Senate testimony before the 
Aviation Subcommittee.
    Even though aviation users pay for the vast majority of FAA's 
budget, there has been unstable and unpredictable funding for over two 
decades due to lapsed appropriations, short-term CRs, and short-term 
authorizations. If ever there was a time and opportunity to reverse 
this troubling trend it is now.
    Every FAA action we expect the agency to take to maintain and 
enhance our nation's aviation system requires passage of a robust

Letter of November 29, 2023, to the U.S. Senate from Nicholas E. Calio, 
President and Chief Executive Officer, Airlines for America, Submitted 
                   for the Record by Hon. Steve Cohen
                                                 November 29, 2023.
United States Senate,
Washington, DC 20510-1304.
    Dear Senator:
    As we approach the end of the calendar year and the expiration of 
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorization, Airlines for 
America (A4A) urges Congress work to pass a five-year FAA 
reauthorization as quickly as possible. We are grateful for the work 
that has been done thus far and are hopeful more progress can be made 
to ensure a long-term, bipartisan and commonsense bill.
    The goals of the U.S. airline industry remain the same: the FAA 
reauthorization should provide long-term safety, stability and a 
congressional understanding of `do no harm' by excluding policies that 
could adversely impact the consumers and airline employees that are so 
important to our industry. Reforming inefficient government processes, 
retiring outdated technology and demanding public sector accountability 
while providing for the global gold-standard of safety will help to 
drive domestic economic growth, promote job creation and--most 
importantly--improve the travel experience for the millions of 
Americans who fly or ship cargo every day.
    The importance and need for a long-term FAA reauthorization cannot 
be overstated, especially at this crucial moment in time for the 
agency. Because of its size and the multitude of responsibilities 
ranging from regulator to operator, the FAA must be able to operate in 
a stable and predictable environment. History has shown that even minor 
disruptions to FAA funding and/or authorizations can have lasting 
impacts on the agency's ability to provide its most basic services. 
Without a long-term reauthorization, the agency will continue to be a 
safety regulator that is behind schedule on existing mandates and is 
struggling to maintain a legacy air traffic control (ATC) system, let 
alone operationalize NextGen priorities or address the acute and 
material air traffic controller shortage.
    Our aviation system moves over 45,000 flights, 2.5 million 
passengers, and more than 59,000 tons of cargo every day across more 
than 29 million square miles of airspace. Commercial aviation in the 
U.S. contributes 5% to the domestic gross domestic product, accounting 
for $1.25 trillion in 2022, while also supporting more than 10 million 
American jobs. We have the safest, most efficient and most complex 
system in the world. A requisite component of that vast U.S. aviation 
system is a well-funded FAA with long-term policy stability and 
accountability measures in place that will allow it to catch up, adapt 
and modernize.
    As you prioritize Congressional action through the rest of the 
118th Congress, we implore you to take action and complete a 
bipartisan, commonsense long-term FAA reauthorization.
            Respectfully,
                                         Nicholas E. Calio,
       President and Chief Executive Officer, Airlines for America.

   Letter of November 29, 2023, to Hon. Charles E. Schumer, Majority 
 Leader, and Hon. Mitch McConnell, Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, and 
  Hon. Mike Johnson, Speaker, and Hon. Hakeem S. Jeffries, Democratic 
Leader, U.S. House of Representatives, from Eric Fanning, President and 
 Chief Executive Officer, Aerospace Industries Association, Submitted 
                   for the Record by Hon. Steve Cohen
                                                 November 29, 2023.
The Honorable Chuck Schumer,

United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510.
The Honorable Mike Johnson,
Speaker,
United States House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Hakeem Jeffries,
Democratic Leader,
United States House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
    Dear Speaker Johnson, Majority Leader Schumer, Republican Leader 
McConnell, and Democratic Leader Jeffries:
    The Aerospace Industries Association's nearly 330 member 
companies--from America's leading manufacturers of commercial aircraft, 
engines, avionics, and air traffic control systems to family-owned 
businesses comprising our supply chain--applaud the leadership of the 
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Senate 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee for their years-long 
work in developing bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
reauthorization legislation that will help move the aviation industry 
forward. We are grateful for the House-passed Securing Growth and 
Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act and hope that the Senate 
will soon pass its own version of this legislation before current 
aviation tax authorities expire on December 31, 2023. Reauthorization 
of the FAA is Congress' critical tool for setting civil aviation on a 
long-term course to success. Improved regulatory and safety processes, 
a stronger workforce pipeline, and restored global leadership at the 
FAA--all key tenets of this year's reauthorization legislation--should 
not be held up any longer.
    The aviation industry is critical to the country's economic 
prosperity. In 2022 alone, our industry generated $418 billion in 
economic value, representing 1.6 percent of total gross domestic 
product (GDP) in the U.S.\1\ Throughout the history of flight, the 
United States has led the way in aviation safety and innovation, thanks 
in part due to the ingenuity of American industry, but also in part due 
to appropriately tailored policies and regulations provided via the FAA 
reauthorization bill. Today, not only are we maintaining our role as 
the gold standard for safety and certification, but the industry is 
also on the cusp of incredible technological advancements that will 
change the way Americans travel. Enacting FAA reauthorization this year 
is critical to advancing America's leadership in aerospace and 
unlocking this potential.

    On November 15, 2023, the FAA's National Airspace Safety Review 
Team released a report stating that Congress' stop-and-start process of 
funding and authorization activity ``has slowed down the implementation 
of key technology modernization programs'' amongst other challenges.\2\ 
Both the House and Senate legislation include key provisions to 
understand how technologies like model-based systems engineering will 
enhance safety in the certification process. Both bills would also 
ensure that the Advanced Air Mobility industry can work with the FAA to 
make that new sector of aviation a reality by ensuring proper oversight 
of the Powered-Lift Special Federal Aviation Regulation.

    The aviation workforce pipeline would also be strengthened by 
broadening the FAA's current Workforce Development Grant Program to 
aviation manufacturing. This is vital as our industry seeks to attract 
the next generation of talent for high-paying, highly skilled jobs. To 
further strengthen our global leadership in aviation, FAA 
reauthorization legislation will improve enforcement of bilateral 
aviation safety agreements, ensuring we can continue to compete on the 
world stage. Now that the FAA has a confirmed Administrator in place, 
we believe it is vitally important to give him these new tools and 
authorities without further delay, to make our aviation system safer 
and more competitive.
    These provisions represent only a snapshot of the bipartisan 
benefits both the House and Senate FAA reauthorization bills will bring 
to the traveling public, the aviation industry, and to our economy 
generally. I urge you to make this bill a priority so that it can be 
enacted by the end of this year.
            Sincerely,

Statement of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association et al. (general 
 aviation organizations), Submitted for the Record by Hon. Steve Cohen
    Chair Graves and Ranking Member Cohen,
    Our organizations collectively represent the broad spectrum of the 
general aviation industry including business and personal 
transportation, pilots and aircraft owners, aviation businesses, and 
state aviation officials. Our community fully supports the completion 
of a long-term reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) as it is important to safeguarding the operations of the National 
Airspace System (NAS). As we have seen in the past, short-term 
extensions challenge the certainty that industry and the FAA depend on 
to enable long-term planning and investment in many critical areas 
required to ensure the safety of the NAS and America's global 
leadership in aviation.
    The general aviation industry contributes an estimated $247 billion 
in economic output and supports 1.2 million jobs in the United States 
while supporting critical services and providing an essential lifeline 
to thousands of communities nationwide. Operating at our nation's 
network of more than 5,000 public-use airports, 13,000 private airports 
and airstrips, and 5,500 heliports, general aviation is an integral 
part of the national transportation system that connects rural areas 
with air travel options and forges links between businesses, their 
suppliers, and their customers. General aviation operations include 
emergency medical personnel and supplies delivery, disaster relief and 
recovery, search and rescue, agricultural aviation activities, 
recreational pursuits, personal transportation, and more. In addition, 
the industry supports commercial aviation by training a significantly 
large percentage of airline pilots.
    We commend the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure and its leadership on the passage of 
the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act, 
H.R. 3935. This bipartisan legislation reauthorizes the FAA's aviation 
safety and infrastructure programs for five years and provides the 
multi-year structure, resources, and direction the FAA needs.
    Additionally, H.R. 3935 recognizes the vital national role of our 
industry by including the first-ever general aviation title, which 
makes critical reforms to FAA services of specific interest to our 
industry segment. This bill enables the FAA to move forward on areas of 
significant importance to general aviation including workforce 
development, regulatory process improvement, airspace modernization, 
and the development and enabling of new technologies.
    On behalf of the general aviation industry, we thank Chairman 
Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Cohen, 
and the subcommittee for holding this hearing and highlighting the 
importance and urgency of completing long-term FAA Reauthorization.

  Statement of Robert W. Rose, Cofounder and Chief Executive Officer, 
 Reliable Robotics Corporation, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Steve 
                                 Cohen
    Chairman Garret Graves, Ranking Member Cohen, and members of the 
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Subcommittee on 
Aviation:
    Thank you for holding this hearing to discuss the importance of 
passing a long-term bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA). Reliable Robotics appreciates the dedication of 
House Aviation Subcommittee members and staff on the bipartisan passage 
of the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act 
(H.R. 3935), which provides a long-term authorization and targeted 
policy direction to the FAA. Our nation's leadership in aviation is not 
guaranteed, and advancing a FAA reauthorization bill that provides the 
agency with the tools, resources, and focus to safely integrate 
advanced technologies and operations into the National Airspace System 
(NAS) is crucial for United States competitiveness.
    Reliable Robotics was founded in 2017 to develop and bring to 
market aviation safety-enhancing technologies, including auto-land, 
auto-taxi, and auto-takeoff, as well as high-integrity navigation and 
remote piloting capabilities. Our technologies enhance aviation safety 
by preventing controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) and loss of control 
in flight (LOC-I), which account for the majority of fatal aviation 
accidents. In addition, high-integrity navigation will provide safer 
access to thousands of general aviation airports in more weather 
conditions without costly ground-based infrastructure.
    Consideration of the FAA reauthorization bill comes at a pivotal 
time for the United States as technologies that will significantly 
improve aviation safety and connect more communities with air service 
are within reach. Thanks to a detailed process to integrate stakeholder 
inputs, H.R. 3935 meets today's challenges by providing the FAA with 
the organizational structure, workforce and policy direction to fully 
integrate advanced technologies into the NAS.
    In addition to providing the dedicated FAA workforce with certainty 
through a long-term reauthorization, H.R. 3935 includes specific 
provisions that will expand United States competitiveness in advanced 
aviation. For example, the bill includes targeted organizational 
changes to modernize the agency, including creating an FAA Deputy 
Administrator for Safety and Operations, which will improve 
coordination across the FAA on the certification of safety-enhancing 
technologies. This leadership position will be responsible for aviation 
safety, aircraft certification, air traffic, and other critical agency 
functions. Having a single reporting point for these functions will 
improve coordination across the FAA, especially for projects involving 
advanced technologies where engagement from aviation safety, air 
traffic, and other lines of business is necessary for safe and 
efficient airspace integration. The reporting structure for the new 
Deputy Administrator and the fact that it is a career position will 
also provide leadership continuity at the FAA.
    Modernizing how the FAA communicates with applicants throughout the 
certification process will streamline operations at the agency and 
improve resource allocation. Through the newly established FAA 
Ombudsman, H.R. 3935 will address this by advancing efforts to create a 
portal that provides applicants and the FAA status information on 
certification applications and other submissions. The agency currently 
has multiple systems to track certification projects, but there is no 
single source of data on project status or which FAA offices are 
engaged in the review. Investing in this capability will modernize how 
the FAA engages with applicants while improving responsiveness to 
information requests. This portal and the requirement that the 
Ombudsman ensures an initial 10-day response to covered submissions 
represent significant improvements to the certification process.
    As advanced technologies move from the FAA certification process 
into operation, addressing delays in the FAA rulemaking, guidance and 
technical standards approval processes are top priorities. The 
Assistant Administrator for Rulemaking position created under H.R. 3935 
will provide the leadership level attention the FAA requires to 
streamline and focus these efforts on the highest priority issues to 
advance aviation safety. Dedicating additional leadership resources to 
the rulemaking process and related efforts to develop approved means of 
compliance for advanced technologies such as Detect and Avoid Systems 
are examples of how this bill is targeting airspace integration 
challenges.
    Along with necessary organizational changes, H.R. 3935 focuses on 
the FAA's staffing levels by analyzing critical competencies and 
focusing resources on safety-focused positions in the Flight Standards 
Service and Aircraft Certification Service. The bill provides the FAA 
with the tools to improve the recruitment and upskilling of inspectors, 
engineers, and other positions focusing on safety-enhancing 
technologies and advanced automation. Additional delays in the passage 
of a long-term reauthorization bill will delay the implementation of 
these provisions and place the FAA further behind in meeting its 
staffing requirements.
    Another important focus area in H.R. 3935 are the technologies and 
public policies needed to integrate safety-enhancing technologies and 
large UAS into the NAS. Specifically, the bill improves the two-way 
sharing of NAS data between the FAA and industry which is necessary to 
fully integrate large UAS into controlled airspace. Along with data 
sharing, the bill focuses on increasing ADS-B Out equipage which has 
safety and airspace integration benefits. Despite the proven safety 
benefits of ADS-B, more than 50,000 civilian aircraft are not equipped 
with ADS-B Out. While these aircraft cannot operate in airspace where 
ADS-B is required or require specific exemptions, the lack of equipage 
limits safety benefits, especially at thousands of non-towered 
airports. Also, other vehicles, including unmanned free balloons, 
ultralights, and gliders, are not required to be ADS-B Out equipped. 
Recent events demonstrate the safety and national security benefits of 
expanding the ADS-B Out to these operations. We appreciate the 
significant focus on both of these areas in the Securing Growth and 
Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act and believe that the 
included provisions will improve aviation safety.
    Improving the process that the FAA utilizes to engage with 
stakeholders on topics such as airspace integration and training 
standards for remote pilots is an opportunity for the agency to keep 
pace with rapidly developing technology. While the federal advisory 
committee process has a history of providing the FAA with this input, 
we appreciate that H.R. 3935 seeks to improve this. Currently, the 
FAA's Advanced Aviation Advisory Committee (AAAC) is charged with 
providing advice on an extremely broad issue set, from small UAS to 
advanced automation and community engagement.
    Unfortunately, this broad purview has limited the AAAC's ability to 
engage on issues important to the advanced aviation community, 
including remote piloting training standards and the transition to 
digital flight. Through re-scoping the AAAC as the ``Unmanned and 
Autonomous Flight Advisory Committee,'' H.R. 3935 will enable the FAA 
and industry to focus on issues that are foundational for advanced air 
mobility and remote piloting.
    These are just a selection of provisions in the Securing Growth and 
Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act that will improve aviation 
safety and integrate advanced technologies into the NAS. Further delays 
in the passage of a long-term reauthorization bill slow the 
implementation of these critical policies, which are necessary for the 
United States to retain and grow its role as the world leader in 
aviation. In the near term, Reliable Robotics looks forward to working 
with members of this Subcommittee and the Senate Committee on Commerce, 
Science & Transportation to continue our progress towards final passage 
of a long-term FAA reauthorization bill.

  Letter of November 29, 2023, to Hon. Sam Graves, Chairman, and Hon. 
  Rick Larsen, Ranking Member, House Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, from Zane Kerby, President and Chief Executive Officer, 
 American Society of Travel Advisors, Submitted for the Record by Hon. 
                              Steve Cohen
                                                 November 29, 2023.
The Honorable Sam Graves and the Honorable Rick Larsen,
Chairman and Ranking Member,
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, 2165 Rayburn 
        House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
    Dear Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen and Members of the 
Committee:
    On behalf of the American Society of Travel Advisors (ASTA) and the 
more than 160,000 travel advisors across the country we represent, I 
write to submit the following into the record in advance of the House 
Transportation and Infrastructure hearing on November 30, 2023, titled 
``Turbulence Ahead: Consequences of Delaying a Long-Term FAA Bill.''
    Established in 1931, ASTA is the world's leading professional 
travel trade organization. Our current membership consists of more than 
8,000 companies representing more than 90,000 travel professionals, 
from the smallest home-based businesses to traditional brick-and-mortar 
storefront agencies to the largest travel management companies and 
online travel agencies. Together, they account for an annual payroll 
output of $5.5 billion and annual revenues of $17.7 billion.
    Those numbers are only sure to increase. Despite economic 
pressures, people are spending more on travel than any other 
discretionary purchase, according to ASTA surveys. Travel advisors are 
experiencing an increase in demand with 22 percent of U.S. travelers 
having used an advisor. Over 30 percent of ASTA members report that 
more than half of their clients are using a travel advisor for the 
first time.
    Which is why the current reauthorization could not have come at a 
better time. As Americans are traveling now more than ever, consumers 
are understandably confused about the myriad policies surrounding air 
travel. From travel advisories and various restrictions to airline fees 
and delays/cancellations, consumers want to travel but find it 
increasingly confusing. Nearly 70 percent of Americans agree that 
``planning a trip is more complex now.'' It should come as no surprise 
that 54 percent of consumers agree that a travel advisor can help them 
better understand the issues regarding airline fees.
    Travel advisors are the key to cutting through that complexity. 
Responsible for the sale of roughly half of air travel in the U.S., 
travel advisors serve an indispensable role in our country's commercial 
aviation system and the broader travel and tourism industry. In 2019, 
travel agencies sold nearly 830,000 airline tickets per day, 
representing 48 percent of total sales and aggregate spending of more 
than $97 billion.\1\

    As such, ASTA's current legislative priority is reauthorization of 
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and we applaud the Committee 
for its swift bipartisan passage of the legislation in June, and for 
now bringing to light the consequences of further delaying its 
progress.
    The Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act 
(H.R. 3935) includes many of the provisions for which ASTA has been 
advocating on behalf of our members since the beginning of the year--
and in some cases far longer. While comprehensive in scope, the bill 
recognizes the invaluable role travel advisors play in the larger 
travel and tourism ecosystem while serving as a key voice for 
consumers.
    The following provisions would particularly benefit travel 
agencies, individual travel advisors and other similarly situated 
third-party intermediaries that make up ASTA's membership and are 
regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT):
    <bullet>  Travel Agency Seat on DOT Consumer Protection Advisory 
Committee (Section 704)--Adds a seat for ``ticket agents and travel 
management companies'' to the DOT's Aviation Consumer Protection 
Advisory Committee, based on freestanding legislation (H.R. 3780) 
introduced by Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV). This provision will provide 
valuable insights that are missing today and help the Department meet 
its consumer protection mission.
    <bullet>  New Consumer Advisory Committee, including Travel 
Agencies (Section 708)--Creates a new ``Passenger Experience Advisory 
Committee'' at DOT, with a seat for ticket agents among its membership. 
The goal of the committee would be to advise the Secretary of 
Transportation on ways to improve the passenger experience in air 
transportation customer service, via biennial reports.
    <bullet>  Disclosures in Offline Ticket Transactions (Section 
709)--Requires DOT to implement a streamlined system for fulfilling air 
consumer disclosure requirements during ``offline'' transactions (over-
the-phone, face-to-face) within 18 months of enactment. For more on the 
challenges faced by travel advisors regarding the multiple disclosures 
they are required by law and regulation to make today and justification 
for Section 709, see ASTA's February submission \2\ to the committees 
of jurisdiction.

Authorizing Committees re: FAA Reauthorization. February 24, 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <bullet>  Travel Agency Refund Obligations (Section 710)--Makes 
clear that a travel agency's obligation to issue a client refund for a 
cancelled or significantly changed flight is limited to scenarios where 
it is in possession of the funds in question, which addresses ASTA's 
concern regarding a separate, pending DOT rulemaking on airline 
refunds.\3\

    We appreciate the time and effort that went into this 
comprehensive, bipartisan bill as well as the collaborative approach 
taken in terms of stakeholder feedback. We further appreciate the 
attention the Committee is giving the widespread implications of 
inaction. Should you or your staff have any questions about ASTA's 
viewpoints or any issue related to the travel industry, please do not 
hesitate to contact ASTA's Vice President, Advocacy, Jessica Klement. 
Thank you for your consideration of our views.
            Yours Sincerely,

    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. I now recognize the gentleman from 
Minnesota, Mr. Stauber, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Stauber. Thank you very much. I first want to recognize 
and thank both Chairmen Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and 
Ranking Member Cohen for their leadership to get this bill not 
only through this committee, but allowing the process to go 
forward.
    The amendments, Mr. Bunce, you mentioned watching the 
amendment process. That is exactly how it's supposed to work. 
And I want to give--I just want to say thanks to every one of 
you here, because your patience on this--this has been sitting 
on Senator Schumer's desk for 5 months. You see the damage that 
is happening. As an airport director, you see what we can fix. 
And so, it is frustrating that we have great leadership on this 
committee in a bipartisan fashion pushing an important 
reauthorization bill, and the Senate sits on it for 5 months. 
Look how much farther we could have been ahead. That is why we 
have to change the way this town delivers legislation for the 
American people.
    We know that general aviation, commercial aviation is only 
going to grow in the years to come. And I want to just, before 
I make my comments, thank you all for your leadership, as well, 
pushing us to make sure that the legislation fits the demands.
    And Mr. Peterson, I first want to thank you for talking 
about the workers, because this bill takes care of the workers 
above and below the wings, which are so important--they have to 
work together. So, I want to thank you.
    In Minnesota, our local news organization, KSTP, recently 
reported on the shortage of airplane mechanics and technicians 
impacting the Minnesota aviation industry, particularly general 
aviation. In the House-passed FAA reauthorization bill, we 
tripled authorized funding for the FAA Section 625 Aviation 
Workforce Development Program. These aviation workforce 
development grants for aviation maintenance technical worker 
support proposals that generate and increase interest and 
prepare students to pursue aviation maintenance careers.
    Mr. Bunce, what would this increased investment in the 
section 625 program mean to the general aviation industry?
    Mr. Bunce. Thank you, Representative Stauber. If you look 
at a facility like Cirrus that you have in the district--and 
Mr. Burchett also has Cirrus in his district--if you just take 
that, we have had competition so much for being able to get 
qualified workers into our factories. We all know what happened 
during the pandemic. We all know all industries are short. But 
if you look at then who we have to work with in the FAA, they 
have also had a great drain of resources.
    So, what you have done in section 625 is be able to not 
only emphasize the importance of pilots--and of course, the 
pilot situation right now, we are building training aircraft. 
Both of the companies that I mentioned, both of you see that we 
are putting a lot of training aircraft out. And because of what 
we are paying pilots right now, this is starting to be solved. 
It won't happen overnight.
    But when you look at maintenance workers and factory 
workers in aerospace, we have a critical shortage. One of our 
companies forecasts for the next 20 years almost 700,000 
technicians is who we need out there. And of course, industry 
then competes with the FAA for that expertise. So, we have got 
to build it both within the Federal agency that regulates us 
and within our workforce.
    So, we are very appreciative of what was included there.
    Mr. Stauber. Mr. Bunce, you mentioned Cirrus Aircraft. In 
their new facility I toured within the last month, I asked the 
question, if you could hire workers today in just this 
facility, they said they would take 200 today. And that is all 
across the country. And so, I appreciate your comments.
    Mr. Peterson, what other aspects of the House-passed bill 
do you think will increase participation in the aviation 
workforce?
    Mr. Peterson. Yes, so, I would say that the bill obviously 
funds areas for the maintenance technicians that we have been 
looking for for years, and this is an area that has been 
lacking as work has gone overseas. And unfortunately, that is 
where the development has gone to. So, the investment in our 
U.S. workforce, and getting students and educating them on why 
they want to enter the career field is critical.
    I was young when I decided to go into this career field, 
realized this is what I wanted to do. But the schools that were 
out there when I was growing up are no longer there, similar to 
other trades. Reinvesting in this type of work and our younger 
generation to do this work is critical, and it is critical 
across all of the aerospace fields, whether it be 
manufacturing, air traffic control, maintenance technicians, 
pilots. All of us are--it is borne in your system and, again, 
it is having the accessibility which has been diminished 
recently, and I would say over the last 15 years.
    Putting the investment back into our workers is what is 
critical for the future.
    Mr. Stauber. Thank you very much, and my time is up.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Stauber. I 
recognize the gentleman from Tennessee, Ranking Member Cohen, 
for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Bradbury, firstly I would like to say I read your 
resume and am impressed with what you have done to bring the 
Portland, Maine, airport up to snuff and in a green fashion.
    Our FAA bill proposes significant increases in annual 
Airport Improvement Program funding. How will these funding 
increases benefit commercial services and general aviation 
airports, and in what ways do they address the infrastructure 
needs outlined in the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport 
Systems?
    Mr. Bradbury. It really is critical. I mean, what we have 
seen is the flat funding with AIP has really caused us to--$13 
billion a year is what the program has. There is $30 billion of 
needs. This is a huge step in getting that infrastructure 
built.
    For us personally, additional discretionary will come 
forward to help with our important safety projects. As I 
mentioned in my oral remarks, our taxiway Alpha is a huge and 
important safety program for the airport, not just Portland, 
but across the country. Really, airports are really thankful 
and appreciative of this change, after 20 years, in increased 
funding for AIP.
    Mr. Cohen. Our bill also includes changes in the AIP 
formula, such as reducing the PFC turnback for large- and 
medium-hub airports. How do these proposed formula changes 
contribute to fair and efficient distribution of Federal funds 
among airports?
    And what impact might they have on the infrastructure 
improvements and safety measures at different sized airports?
    Mr. Bradbury. Certainly, safety is important on the ground, 
just as it is in the air, and it is critical that we have the 
needed funding. The PFC hasn't increased in years, so, making 
it that our medium and large hubs can use more of the AIP funds 
is critical.
    The additional funding is really funding more projects. At 
the end of the day, that is the reality. It increases the 
amount of funding for aviation safety on the ground, and 
aviation safety on the ground is getting that infrastructure 
built and in place. Hugely critical.
    Mr. Cohen. Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Peterson, in addressing the issue of assault on airline 
workers, what steps or action items has your Transport Workers 
Union put forth to update employer assault prevention and 
response plans, and what specific provisions does our bill 
include to mitigate the threats faced by customer-facing 
airline workers?
    Mr. Peterson. Yes. Again, developing a task force that 
involves labor and management together to look at those 
critical areas, the bill provides for that.
    It also provides the opportunity for penalties to be 
announced if somebody assaults a worker and whatnot.

                                 <F-dash>
   Post-Hearing Correction of Remarks from Gary Peterson, Executive 
              Director, Transport Workers Union of America
    Mr. Peterson. Yes. Again, developing a task force that involves 
labor and management together to look at those critical areas, the bill 
provides for that.
    It also requires the FAA to incorporate in pre-takeoff briefings a 
statement informing passengers that it is against Federal law to 
assault a crewmember.

    Mr. Peterson. And again, I think the addition of not just 
in the air, but on-the-ground assaults of workers at airports 
has recently become even more critical. These are all elements 
that need to be addressed, and they are addressed in the bill. 
But certainly, having individuals know what the penalty can and 
will be, and a mechanism for that is addressed in the bill.
    What is not addressed in the bill is a no-fly list and some 
of the things that we would have liked to have seen. Maybe in 
the future those things will happen. Or what I think, more 
importantly, is the bill addresses a way to diminish what is 
happening, bring that temperature down, and bringing that 
temperature down will hopefully solve a lot of the issues that 
we are facing today.
    Mr. Cohen. Thank you, and thank you for all the members of 
your union who do so much to make our flying----
    Mr. Peterson [interposing]. Thank you.
    Mr. Cohen [continuing]. Much more safe and convenient.
    Mr. Bunce, Colonel, your statements about the impact of a 
delayed long-term FAA bill were quite compelling, especially 
the remarks made in reference to unleaded avgas. Since 
sustainability is a key topic within aviation currently, can 
you briefly explain GAMA's role in the Eliminate Aviation 
Gasoline Lead Emissions initiative, and why the transition to 
unleaded fuel for piston-engine aircraft is important for the 
environment?
    Mr. Bunce. Sir, the EAGLE initiative, Eliminate Aviation 
Gasoline Lead Emissions, is a very important one that brings 
together all of the general aviation associations along with 
the FAA to be able to work along with the EPA, which recently 
released its endangerment finding, to all work on a solution 
together.
    And I am very proud to report that just--we just had a 
press release earlier this week that success has been achieved 
with the Piston Engine Aviation Fuels Initiative with one of 
the companies that is going through that testing, which we do 
up at the FAA Tech Center, to be able to check the endurance of 
the fuel that they are offering, the unleaded fuel that they 
are offering, to be able to go and solve this problem.
    There is such a strong commitment, and the support from 
what we have seen from this committee not only will help work 
getting rid of the lead out of the avgas, but then also the 
work that this committee is doing on sustainable aviation fuel, 
and trying to push that forward is absolutely critical, and we 
really appreciate the support so that turbine aviation, which 
the airlines use--and of course, our turboprop aircraft and our 
business jets use and our rotorcraft--is absolutely paramount 
to be able to achieve the goals that we, as industry, both 
general aviation and civil aviation, have set to be net 0 by 
2050.
    Mr. Cohen. Thank you, and I would yield back the balance of 
my time.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Cohen. The other 
gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Burchett, is recognized for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate my 
colleague from Tennessee, Congressman Cohen.
    Yesterday, I was talking to some young students, college 
students, a group of Jewish folks, and I was talking to them 
about Israel, of course, but I invited them into my office. And 
one of them actually pointed out a Cirrus aircraft, a model of 
it that was on my desk, and that he actually flew one of those. 
And I thought that was pretty cool, and I appreciate you 
mentioning that. We are very proud of that in our district.
    And I apologize, I am wearing a coat. I am a little cold. 
Pete Stauber, he was basically in shirt sleeves over here, 
burning up. Of course, he is from Minnesota, so, I guess that 
tells you why. And I am from Tennessee, so, I am just a little 
cold over here.
    But, Mr. Bunce, what role does your industry play in 
implementing the FAA reauthorization?
    Mr. Bunce. We work very closely with the FAA. I think 
people realize, obviously, Mr. Santa's controllers do a 
phenomenal job of keeping us safe and everything, but we have 
routine interactions with the FAA all the time in the 
certification and flight standards area. So, that part of the 
FAA is very critical to us, and that part of the FAA is the one 
that has had a tremendous drain in mid-level management and 
also younger people.
    Industry competes on wages, and a lot of people have just 
simply left for the private sector. And so, it is of paramount 
importance to us that those technicians that we work with are 
trained properly, are back in the office so that they can 
collaborate together, and those older heads that are still 
there can train that younger workforce to be able to work with 
a sector where technology is progressing so rapidly. And the 
only way we will be able to keep up and our regulatory 
authorities can be able to remain the gold standard for 
aviation across the planet is to be able to have that training 
and that working in the office together.
    Mr. Burchett. On the same track, what do you think is the 
best way for Congress--for us--to work with industry on that 
implementation?
    Mr. Bunce. I think what you have done also with workforce 
development. But also, the FAA responds very strongly to 
questions from Congress and pressure. And really, as each one 
of these reauthorizations go through the process, you require 
some rulemaking that is done. A lot of us in industry come to 
you to ask for that rulemaking because things aren't happening 
fast enough. So, having the FAA report to you on some metrics, 
just an ability to see how quickly they process all of the work 
that has to be done, there has got to be some type of 
accountability, especially within the certification workforce, 
that they provide industry answers to things like issue papers 
that we often are required to put forward, and they just go 
back and forth within the bureaucracy, and we don't get an 
answer.
    And any answer is better than no answer. If they say no, we 
try to figure out how to go ahead and give them a new approach 
to be able to have a positive answer. This is important.
    Mr. Burchett. Let me ask you. Will the reauthorization--
will it help support the private-sector innovation?
    Mr. Bunce. Absolutely. There is a lot of emphasis that you 
all put in technology here. And when we look at advanced air 
mobility, when we look at unmanned aircraft systems, technology 
will provide some answers that help provide to Mr. Santa's 
workforce some new technology out there, new methods to be able 
to go and have the situational awareness to be able to handle 
the increased amount of vehicles we are going to put into the 
airspace.
    And so, being able to address the significant workforce 
issues that we have, coupled with providing the technology both 
to pilots in the air, those that control unmanned aircraft 
systems, and also providing Mr. Santa's workforce with new 
technology will help us maintain this safety that we have come 
to know and appreciate.
    Mr. Burchett. Thank you.
    Mr. Bradbury, can you provide us some examples of some 
unnecessary redtape that the FAA reauthorization should 
address? I know Mr. Bunce mentioned things back and forth.
    Mr. Bradbury. Certainly. There have been a couple of 
circumstances where Congress has set forth on land that was 
purchased or procured with airport funds, and being able to use 
that and put it into exceptional and market use, that has been 
a slower process than anticipated, and I think misinterpreted 
by the FAA Congress' intent. So, that is just one example that 
we have seen that we are expecting improvement on with this 
bill.
    Mr. Burchett. OK. Mr. Chairman, I yield the rest of my 
time. Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Burchett. I 
recognize the gentleman from Washington, the ranking member of 
the full committee, Mr. Larsen, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair. In hearing 
our discussion and hearing your testimony, I am struck by a 
line Stephen Colbert used on his first show, when he named a 
President and asked, ``Great President or greatest President?'' 
The FAA bill is a great bill, or is it the greatest bill? 
Frankly, it is the greatest.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. And we need to see some movement 
on it in the Senate, and I think your testimony outlines that.
    Mr. Santa, though, this month on the Safety Review Team, 
which is independent, this independent entity, published its 
report on assessing risks. More than half of its 
recommendations, 13 out of 24 recommendations, specifically 
focused on air traffic controller staffing and training. Can 
you yourself elaborate a little bit on the SRT's findings with 
regards to staffing and training, please, for us?
    Mr. Santa. Yes, thank you for the question. That report 
exemplifies precisely the problems we have had for the past 10 
or 15 years.
    The FAA Office of Finance and Management has a staffing 
model that has attrited our workforce to unsustainable levels. 
We want to work to new entrants. We want to service general 
aviation, cargo, commercial traffic, anything that comes where 
the professional air traffic controllers--and we love aviation, 
we love this industry, but with the current staffing levels, 
capacity is reduced. It is not sustainable to maintain the FAA 
Office of Finance and Management's report in the controller 
workforce plan.
    That is why it is so essential that your bill has the new, 
tested, transparent, traceable, Collaborative Resource 
Workgroup numbers as the plan for the controller workforce 
plan. That will ultimately bring transparency and understanding 
to the health of our air traffic control facility staffing, 
which is abysmal right now. Six-day workweeks and ten-hour days 
are not sustainable. One-man sectors are not sustainable. We 
need more people in our facilities. With the maximum hiring for 
the duration of the bill, that will help us tremendously. Thank 
you.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Do you have some insight on what 
the Senate is considering?
    Mr. Santa. I don't have any insight, but working with them, 
we would like precisely what is written in the House bill.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Probably no disagreement up here.
    Mr. Peterson, the aviation workforce, as well, continues to 
face some challenges, ranging from workplace conditions, 
concerns over workplace conditions, to whether workers are 
guaranteed the proper training and compensation. What are some 
major challenges facing your members, and can you remind us 
what our bill did about that?
    Mr. Peterson. I think one of the key components of the bill 
is all the investment in training, recurrent training and 
current training.
    The investment in the future for maintenance technicians, 
training in the area of--I know we talked a little bit about 
the wheelchairs, right, handling wheelchairs. The ability to 
handle wheelchairs sounds simple except for how do you get it 
from the level of the aircraft down to the ground level. The 
infrastructure at the airports isn't necessarily in place. That 
gets addressed in the bill. The training for folks on how to 
move those wheelchairs gets addressed in the bill.
    Again, there is some investment in training for flight 
attendants for self-defense and those types of things.
    What I can say is my view of what is in this bill--and this 
body has done a great job of addressing things that we have 
been talking about, as the workforce, for years. And it hits on 
all of those. So, I mean, I could go through step by step, but 
you guys have hit on all marks. And that is why this bill is so 
critical in getting it done.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Do you have any insights on what 
the Senate bill, Senate discussion is?
    Mr. Peterson. I do not.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Does anyone have any insight on 
what the Senate is doing?
    Sorry. That is good enough for me. I appreciate it, and I 
will yield back.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Larsen. I recognize 
the gentleman from South Dakota, Dusty Johnson.
    Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. 
Ranking Member. I love, love, love the topic of this hearing, 
because I do think it is worth reminding every--this town loves 
to languish, right? We make progress, and then it seems like 
inertia grinds us to a halt.
    But this committee got an impressive bipartisan work 
product done on time. And again, I want to thank the chairman 
and the ranking member for that. It was a pretty impressive 
package, as has been alluded to a number of times. It had major 
provisions that accomplished the major priorities that our 
leadership talked about. I do want to highlight quickly a few 
of the things that I fought for.
    First off, encouraging the FAA to develop a digital, cloud-
based, interactive platform to speed environmental review so we 
can get more of these infrastructure projects done in a timely 
manner; an increase to the General Aviation Non-Primary 
Entitlement Program; greater flexibility on the Airport 
Improvement Program funding; and then commonsense reforms to 
the Essential Air Service. We, of course, needed some reforms. 
We also wanted to make sure that, while we were enacting those 
reforms, we protected rural airports in places like Watertown, 
Aberdeen, and Pierre in South Dakota.
    This committee has done its work, and I think it is time 
for us to continue to amp up the pressure so that Washington 
can stop with the languishing of this long-term aviation 
reauthorization.
    A few questions for our panelists.
    First off, Mr. Santa, talk to us a little bit about the 
value of the Contract Tower Program to our National Airspace 
System.
    And then give us some sense, if we don't get a long-term 
reauthorization, if there are any threats to airports.
    Mr. Santa. Well, there are hundreds of communities serviced 
by the Federal contract program. They are generally smaller 
airports that serve mostly general aviation, and they are 
valuable. We have controllers and facilities and fields that 
generally wouldn't get that level of service due to that 
program. That program is always up for debate when 
reauthorization lapses, and I think it would be a difficult 
pill to swallow, losing those facilities temporarily due to a 
lapse of reauthorization.
    Other than that, I know that in this bill, there is an 
evaluation of some of the facilities.
    As I said before, 10-year staffing models: It's a lifetime 
in this industry. It changes every single day. So, evaluating 
those to recapture some of the highest capacity facilities does 
make a lot of sense, and it is included in the bill.
    Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. And then for Mr. Bradbury, you 
heard me talk about Essential Air Service. I think it is an 
incredibly important provision to make sure that our country is 
connected in the same way that interstate highways go through 
rural areas as well. Talk to us about the impact to those most 
rural airports if we don't have a long-term reauthorization 
soon.
    Mr. Bradbury. Certainly. I can speak right from Maine. 
Maine is a large, rural State, and Essential Air Service plays 
an important part in connecting a large, rural State to the 
national air transportation system. Not only the national air 
transportation system, but the worldwide air transportation 
system. Critical. We have Essential Air Service at Presque 
Isle. We have Essential Air Service in Augusta, Maine. And 
Portland, Maine, is a small hub, but it is critical. Those are 
just two examples for what becomes part of the national air 
transportation system.
    Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. So, if we don't have Essential 
Air Service, or if there isn't the predictability of a 5-year 
reauthorization, does that put any particular stress or 
uncertainty onto these rural communities?
    Mr. Bradbury. I believe it does. I certainly believe it 
does. And by talking with those other airport managers in the 
State, it is a concern, no question. I mean, we need 
reauthorization to keep these programs going.
    Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. I also talked about speeding 
environmental review. Give us some sense of how that might 
benefit airports. I know a lot of them have a number of 
infrastructure projects they would like to get done over the 
course of the next few years.
    Mr. Bradbury. Certainly. I mean, every project, it is a 
long process to get through some of the environmental review, 
and sometimes it is even--when you miss certain deadlines in 
that process, it can set a whole project back. We ultimately 
get there, but every time we can speed that up and have the 
same result, it is huge. It is really just about efficiency and 
keeping costs lower, part of that efficiency.
    Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. I mean, do you have a quick 
horror story? What is the longest that you have heard of a 
project going, from bid letting to completion, and maybe 
slowdowns because of environmental review?
    Mr. Bradbury. Yes, I do have a horror story. It was an 
incident take plan, but it was with investigations in skat from 
a rabbit that held up a project indefinitely until we could get 
that all worked out with the Department of Inland Fisheries and 
Wildlife. We were at the northern extreme boundary of a certain 
type of rabbit.
    Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you. The gentleman from 
Georgia, the other Mr. Johnson, is recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for 
holding this hearing. And thank you to the witnesses for your 
testimony today.
    In today's political climate, it is not often that 
Americans see colleagues on both sides of the aisle on any 
particular committee come together in a unified way to get 
anything done. But that is exactly what happened when this 
committee voted 63 to 0 back in July to pass the FAA 
reauthorization bill out of committee, a bill that required a 
four corners agreement to ensure that both sides came to the 
table for the benefit of our constituents, but most 
importantly, for the American people as a whole.
    A few of my priorities as we crafted this legislation were 
combating aircraft noise, strengthening aviation safety, 
diversifying the workforce, and enhancing the air travel 
experience for both passengers and workers, all of which I can 
say this bill does a good job of addressing.
    I was extremely proud to see the Willa Brown Aviation 
Education Program to support outreach and educational 
opportunities in underrepresented communities included. This 
program would be instrumental in strengthening and diversifying 
the U.S. aviation workforce, with the overarching goal being to 
address the shortage of workers in the aviation industry.
    Mr. Santa, adequate staffing levels not only enhance the 
ability to manage increasingly complex airspace, but also 
mitigate the risk of fatigue-related errors, ultimately 
safeguarding the well-being of passengers and the integrity of 
global air transportation systems. Your testimony states that, 
`` . . . understaffing forces the FAA to assign mandatory 
overtime to controllers on a regular basis.''
    What are the safety risks that this kind of work schedule 
creates for the National Airspace System?
    Mr. Santa. Thank you for the question. It is all 
exacerbated by the lack of staffing.
    When you are working 6-day workweeks and making thousands 
of decisions an hour on position, and none of them can be 
wrong--the margin of error is not 0.0001, you have to be 100 
percent accurate, because the safety of the passengers and the 
industry rely upon you--and working 6-day workweeks, 10-hour 
days, 200 hours a month, it is a strain, it is a stress. It is 
fatiguing. And to eliminate or to combat that, we need maximum 
hiring, and we need the controller workforce plan to have the 
basis of the CRWG numbers, precisely what your bill does.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Is it possible that controller 
fatigue may have played a role in any of the near-miss 
incidents over the past year?
    Mr. Santa. Those instances are still under investigation, 
and we have party status with the NTSB, so, I can't comment on 
those.
    But fatigue is a factor in the capacity of the system, for 
sure. The delays----
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia [interrupting]. Are----
    Mr. Santa [interposing]. Go ahead.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Air traffic controllers are only 
humans, right?
    Mr. Santa. That is correct.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Yes. Your testimony also talks 
about the lasting impacts of extreme budget cuts such as the 
across-the-board cuts from sequestration a decade ago. Can you 
elaborate on what impacts these Republican-induced budget 
squeezes, Government shutdowns, and even the threat of lapsed 
funding, what that has had on controller hiring and the safety 
of our airspace system?
    Mr. Santa. Absolutely. I think Mr. Bunce put it clearly. We 
need new technology, we need enhancements. And unfortunately, 
with the FAA budget request, we are in sustainment and fix-on-
fail only.
    A few stats are ASDE-X, which is an essential tool for 
runway surface separation. It will not be expanded to any new 
facilities. TFDM, which is an enhancement, was initially slated 
for 89 facilities. It is down to 32 sites because of funding 
issues. We have delayed enhancements to our legacy system, our 
radar systems, that will impact the future to be able to handle 
the increased traffic, systemwide.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Mr. Bunce, do you want to add a 
final comment to that?
    Mr. Bunce. It's not only some of the very expensive 
technology that Mr. Santa just pointed out that just can't be 
funded, but also what you have done in this bill is encourage 
the ability for us to put the technology into lower cost 
solutions that actually provide great situational awareness.
    Right now, when--and both Rich and I are pilots, we all 
carry these in the cockpit [indicating notebook]. Well, there 
is technology out there right now where the controllers can 
send us a taxi path electronically. And young people that are 
new to flying and aviation, they are used to following a 
magenta line, just like they do in their automobiles. Well, we 
can transmit that magenta line to them. This thing talks to you 
to say if you stray from it, and it gives you warnings. We 
could put this out today, and it would enhance our surface 
awareness capability with other very low-cost solutions. And if 
we focus on that, we can provide the technology both on the 
ground and in the air that really helps in the safety regime.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you.
    I thank the chair for his indulgence, and with that, I 
yield back.
    Mr. Yakym [presiding]. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Owens 
for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Owens. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Ranking Member Cohen, 
and our distinguished guests and witnesses for taking the time 
to shine a light on the devastating consequences of failing to 
pass a long-term FAA reauthorization. While there is no 
shortage of crises in this body to address, few are more 
pressing than keeping airlines flying, passengers safe, 
flightcrews on time, and air traffic control towers functional.
    Air travel is becoming increasingly painful for both 
passenger and crew alike. The fallout from no FAA 
reauthorization only perpetuates the diminishing trust 
Americans place in aviation infrastructure. We are in a 
position to help restore confidence in air travel, and I think 
I speak for this room: We all want to be a part of that 
solution. Congress owes it to the nearly 3 million American 
passengers who travel every day to get this bill over the 
finish line.
    Mr. Bunce, in your testimony you observed the industry is 
going through an era of development and innovation in 
technology that rivals the dawn of the jet age. Can you 
elaborate how this FAA reauthorization differs from those in 
the past, and why this time the stakes are higher?
    Mr. Bunce. At this point in time, with technology moving as 
rapidly as it is, we have to have the FAA keep up. And as I 
mentioned earlier, we have to have the training available for 
them to be able to understand the new technology. The experts 
are out in industry. Our regulators need to be familiar with 
that technology to be able to properly regulate and do the 
safeguards that we all have seen over the last several years is 
a great emphasis to this Congress and the American people.
    And so, as we look at this rapid innovation in technology, 
we have got to be smart on what electric technology does 
because we are all looking--we were just talking about 
Essential Air Service. We are going to be able to provide, with 
advanced air mobility vehicles, not only the ones that fly 
vertically, what we call eVTOL, but some of the conventional 
takeoff and landing aircraft, an ability to be able to help 
with rural America and be able to provide that transportation 
to our hubs.
    And we also can use the--our Nation has an incredible 
network of airports that no other Nation has, over 5,000 public 
use airports. Some of them have towers, some of them do not. 
But by allowing the technology to move forward such as having 
remote towers and a capability to be able to network all of our 
facilities together, really provides us an ability to expand 
and allow these new entrants to come into the airspace safely.
    Mr. Owens. Thank you.
    Mr. Bradbury, my brandnew hometown airport in Salt Lake 
City is currently in phase 2 of a three-part, $5 billion 
redevelopment. Can you explain the impact of a delayed FAA 
reauthorization to Salt Lake City International Airport and 
other airports undergoing modernization efforts?
    Mr. Bradbury. Sure. I mean, the great thing of this bill 
is, it's not just airside safety. It also will allow terminal 
enhancements and gives us some flexibility in funding those 
terminal improvements which will enhance the passenger 
experience and the accessibility to our airports.
    So, we really appreciate some of this thinking on the 
process in this bill and the AIP program.
    Mr. Owens. OK. And Mr. Santa, what benefits--now again, I 
just want to kind of reemphasize some comments you made 
earlier. I think everybody needs to hear this again. What 
benefits could the National Airspace System realize if FAA 
addressed the air traffic control shortage? Could this improve 
operational tempos at airports or increase the amount of 
traffic that can be handled in the Northeast?
    Mr. Santa. Yes, capacity is immediately increased due to 
more than one person working a sector. More eyes at the sector 
allows higher capacity, better safety margins, better pilot 
reports, and turbulence reports. It is a system that relies on 
more bodies to run higher intensity traffic in the Northeast 
Corridor or in Florida or in Las Vegas.
    We are stressed so far now by single-sector operations that 
the limiting factor--you are missing your connections, you are 
missing your vacation destinations because capacity is reduced. 
So, capacity is the biggest benefit of adequate staffing.
    Mr. Owens. I also want to thank you guys here. I happen, 
again, to live in Salt Lake City, in probably one of the most 
innovative States in the union, and we are growing like crazy. 
And it is based on how we handle our infrastructure, not only 
Salt Lake City International Airport, but also Provo and 
beyond.
    So, we really need to get this done with, because cities 
like ours need to make sure we can plan out in the future, and 
that is based on how well you guys can plan out and put things 
in place. So, thank you so much for what you are doing.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Yakym. The Chair now recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California, Ms. Brownley.
    Ms. Brownley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I hope this 
strategy works by having this hearing today that will spur the 
Senate to act with haste.
    Mr. Peterson, thank you for mentioning Mr. Molinaro and my 
bill in your testimony. And I really do appreciate your work to 
ensure that aircraft are being maintained safely, regardless of 
where in the world they happen to be repaired. Can you share 
some examples of concerning maintenance work your members have 
found on aircraft repaired outside of the United States?
    Mr. Peterson. Sure, aircraft engine components held 
together with tape, wire, which is completely out of 
compliance. We found that as they have come back to the U.S. 
Aircraft painted with flammable and toxic paints. Damage 
repaired through a painting process, not doing the actual 
repair, but just painting over the top of it. Doors installed 
upside down and backwards.
    We have also experienced along the way--and this isn't just 
germane to the overhaul of the aircraft, but we have 
experienced guns, drugs behind panels, hidden behind panels, 
whether it be in the wheel well, avionics bays, or even in the 
lavatories. It is a common thread that we find as these 
aircraft go into these heavy maintenance facilities.
    Accessibility--as a passenger, you see the outside of the 
aircraft, the cabin and whatnot. As a maintenance technician, 
we see behind those panels. Most of those panels don't get 
opened unless there is something wrong. So, it is very easy to 
do things and put things in places that don't get accessed for 
many months or even years at a time. And this is a concern that 
we have, obviously, with foreign facilities and access to 
aircraft. This is one of the reasons why the FAA and their 
ability to oversee and look at these facilities like they do 
U.S. facilities.
    I will give you a prime example: China. I don't know that 
an inspector has been in China in years. They were doing 
inspections by video. If they want to come on our property in 
the U.S., they walk in and they can ask me any question they 
want. In China, they need 6 months' notice to go visit a 
facility. That's insane. And the standards are so different 
that--we are held to this standard, they are held to that 
standard. We need to be held to the same standard, and I am 
proud of the standards we have here.
    And that's why I'm passionate about the bill, I'm 
passionate about the work that you guys have put forward. Those 
are just some prime examples.
    Ms. Brownley. So, are the airlines returning work to the 
United States after they are aware of these instances?
    Mr. Peterson. No, they just move it around, to be fair. We 
do a lot of rework. We get airplanes back that are not in 
flying condition, and we wind up redoing a lot of the work in 
the U.S. to put it back in a flying state. Not the full check, 
but pieces of that check.
    So, again, the standards aren't the same. Who is doing the 
aircraft maintenance, working on the aircraft, it is absolutely 
not the same. And unfortunately, we wind up doing a lot of 
repairs on other people's work. We have been blessed not to 
have an accident, and I hope that never happens, but eyes on 
these aircraft need to change.
    Ms. Brownley. Well, having a blessing is not really the 
right policy. But is the FAA taking any action under its 
existing authority to enforce some of these safety rules?
    Mr. Peterson. Well, the FAA has had--I will just use the 
drug and alcohol piece of this. The FAA, that legislation, was 
passed in 2012, I believe, and it's sad it hasn't been acted 
upon. I am proud that that's addressed in this bill, and it 
will move forward. The Office of Management and Budget has 
moved that forward now.
    That's a prime example of--we have drug and alcohol testing 
for our folks. They don't have drug and alcohol testing. If 
it's not necessary, then why are we doing it? And let me say 
this, it's absolutely necessary. It is fundamental to what we 
do. We all understand that.
    Ms. Brownley. Thank you, sir, very, very much.
    I don't have much time left, but Mr. Bradbury, I wanted to 
ask you. I have done some work around sustainable aviation 
fuel. From your perspective, what can Congress do in this 
upcoming FAA reauthorization, to really help airports develop 
SAF fueling infrastructure to increase the supply and provide 
cleaner fuel?
    Mr. Bradbury. The FAST grants are a good start, and we 
appreciate that this reauthorization will keep that kind of 
work moving.
    We have submitted for one in the Northeast region through 
Boston to really look at the logistics and the delivery of SAF 
to the Northeast, so, looking forward to it. It is important, 
and it is the way to really help on the carbon footprint of the 
aviation system.
    Ms. Brownley. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Yakym. I thank the gentlewoman. I now recognize myself 
for 5 minutes. I would like to thank our chair, as well as our 
ranking member, for their work on this FAA reauthorization, and 
I am hopeful that we will get this across the finish line soon.
    It was 142 days ago that this committee unanimously passed 
its FAA reauthorization bill after a robust, open, transparent, 
and bipartisan markup. It was 133 days ago that the House 
passed this bill 351 to 69, after, again, a robust, open, 
transparent, bipartisan floor process. It's good to finally see 
some green shoots from our Senate colleagues, and I hope this 
means that we can get back to work on a final bill very soon.
    But as we eagerly await that, I commend the chairman for 
convening this hearing to highlight some of the important 
things that an FAA reauthorization means for all users of our 
national airspace. It is things like ensuring our gold standard 
of aviation safety, strengthening the general aviation 
community, increasing funding and flexibility for airport 
infrastructure, addressing the pilot shortage, and facilitating 
the future of aviation with firm timelines for the FAA to 
finally issue a beyond visual line-of-sight rulemaking for 
unmanned aircraft systems, as well as final interim regulations 
for advanced air mobility systems. There are these and so many 
more provisions that will help propel our aviation industry 
forward in the next 5 years.
    Mr. Bunce, your testimony mentions the importance of 
facilitating more timely, transparent, and accountable 
promulgation of rulemaking, policy, guidance, and related 
materials. Can you explain why the rulemaking process is so 
critical to getting aviation innovation to the marketplace, and 
how H.R. 3935 addresses these challenges?
    Mr. Bunce. Sir, our industry is very unique. We really 
can't do anything without a rule. So, if you have a very 
laborious rulemaking process that takes years and years, what 
happens is it doesn't keep pace with technology, but it also 
allows for other authorities outside the U.S. to be able to 
lead in aviation rulemaking. So, let me give you a few 
examples.
    I mean, we were looking at the cybersecurity rule. Pretty 
darn important to be able to address cyber in this day and age. 
It has been languishing.
    We look at what is called SMS, Safety Management System, 
rule. We have a critical rule in front of us right now that 
impacts advanced air mobility, which we refer to as the SFAR, 
and it is a Special Federal Aviation Regulation process. And if 
we don't get this right, we will not lead the world in advanced 
air mobility.
    You mentioned BVLOS, beyond visual line-of-sight 
operations. We are primed to do that, and I am very happy to 
report that the differences between the traditional manned 
aviation community that operates down in low altitude a lot to 
a lot of our airfields, our helicopter fleets and that, now 
that these companies are being able to equip with what we call 
detect and avoid technology, a lot of that impasse now has 
melted away. And it is time for the FAA to start moving to get 
BVLOS across the goal line.
    But if it takes years and years, one of the other problems 
is, we don't let other authorities, when we go into what we 
call ex parte, to participate in collaborative rulemaking. 
That's just crazy. When you have a rule that takes 3 years 
long, to not allow them, when comments come in and they 
adjudicate those comments, to then go and coordinate with 
somebody like EASA, the European Aviation Safety Agency, is 
crazy.
    Mr. Yakym. Thank you. As a part of this FAA 
reauthorization, I was proud to have a bipartisan amendment 
that I co-led with my colleague from Nevada, Ms. Titus, 
included in this bill. It was a simple amendment that requires 
the FAA to set its air traffic controller hiring target at the 
maximum number that can be trained at the FAA Academy through 
all 5 years of the reauthorization.
    Mr. Santa, you have talked about the challenges facing the 
air traffic controller workforce, but can you talk a little bit 
more about the importance of this specific provision in the 
context of the overall bill?
    Mr. Santa. Well, personally, I want to thank you for that 
amendment. It will pay huge dividends for the air traffic 
controllers, having maximum hire for 5 years.
    As you heard, even maximum hiring for 5 years results in 
understaffed facilities. If we don't pass this bill, and the 
FAA Academy closes, and the hiring is suspended, we will be set 
back even farther. But maximum hiring for the duration of the 
bill will start, along with the Collaborative Resource 
Workgroup being the basis for the controller workforce plan, 
will start the healing of our facilities and the increasing of 
the staffing in 313 facilities across the NAS.
    Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Santa.
    I yield back, and the Chair now recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona, Mr. Stanton.
    Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding 
this hearing. Thank you to each of the witnesses for being here 
today.
    The committee has worked hard to craft a strong, proactive, 
and bipartisan 5-year Federal Aviation Administration 
reauthorization bill and send it to the House floor, where it 
passed overwhelmingly. We did our job. But in the 4 months 
since, the Senate hasn't even held a committee vote on this 
critical bill. And because they couldn't meet their original 
deadline, the FAA is operating under a short-term extension 
that expires on New Year's Eve, 4 short weeks away.
    We need to keep our skies safe and our planes moving, in 
part so people can see their friends and family, but also 
because aviation is a key part of our national and 
international economy. Arizona's aviation economy supports 
nearly 19,000 jobs and contributes billions to the State and 
the country.
    Look, we have the safest and most efficient aviation system 
in the world. This Thanksgiving was one of the busiest travel 
days ever, and the women and men who staff our airports, 
airlines, and air traffic control towers deserve credit for 
keeping things running smoothly, as all airport workers did, as 
well.
    But one of the issues I hear about most often is aviation 
workforce shortages, particularly air traffic controllers. And 
overworked, understaffed air traffic control towers are one of 
the contributing factors leading to the rise in harrowing near-
misses at airports nationwide. Over the last year, there have 
been several near-misses at Sky Harbor in Phoenix, one of the 
busiest airports in the world.
    At Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, one of the fastest growing 
commercial airports in the country, we just opened a brandnew 
$30 million air traffic control tower. But staffing shortages 
have forced the airport to reduce operations at the tower by 4 
hours per day.
    The House's FAA reauthorization, the one the Senate has yet 
to take action on, increases FAA hiring targets for air traffic 
controllers, sets up workforce development programs to improve 
recruitment and retention, and sets up a pilot program to 
convert towers staffed by private companies, like at Phoenix-
Mesa Gateway, to be staffed by FAA controllers.
    It is not just airplane safety. Our bill also addresses 
passenger safety, as well, particularly the safety of 
passengers with disabilities. Just last week, a video went 
viral showing ground personnel carelessly throwing a 
passenger's wheelchair down a ramp, where it bumped off and 
bounced across the tarmac, and we have a video.
    [Video shown.]
    Mr. Stanton. People depend upon these devices to move 
around, to get to their jobs, to visit family and friends. 
These mobility devices are not inexpensive. They can range up 
to tens of thousands of dollars. And there needs to be 
oversight on this carelessness, and I stand ready to work with 
my colleagues here and with the Department of Transportation to 
ensure everyone feels safe and able to travel.
    Our House-passed FAA bill takes meaningful, commonsense 
steps, many that I was proud to lead on, to improve the flying 
experience for passengers with disabilities. My ADAPT Act, 
WHEELChairs on Airplanes Act, and the Mobility Aids on Board 
Improve Lives and Empower All (MOBILE) Act, were included in 
the House-passed bill so that passengers with mobility issues 
can have proper accommodations from boarding to seating, and 
everything in between.
    I think I speak for all of us here when I say that we will 
keep working to get this bill across the finish line. Our 
economy and the safety of the flying public depends on that, 
and we need our colleagues in the Senate to be better partners.
    Mr. Santa, I want to build on my colleagues' comments and 
questions on how to better our air traffic controller workforce 
to keep our skies safe. The Safety Review Team report, an 
independent panel commissioned by the FAA to look at near-
misses, specifically talks about how the plan to replenish the 
workforce is dated and, frankly, unrealistic.
    Specifically, when accounting for retirements and other 
attrition, the current plan reduces ``a negligible improvement 
over today's understaffed levels,'' to the tune of less than 
200 additional controllers on the job by 2032.
    I have two questions: first, how can we attract more people 
to be air traffic controllers; and second, if we can't, what 
does this mean for the chances of more near-misses, or even the 
possibility of collisions, at airports?
    Thank you. And then after the question, I will yield back 
to the chair.
    Mr. Santa. Attracting people to the profession hasn't been 
historically difficult. On a bid, we will get upwards of 10,000 
applicants. The problem is the hiring process. The FAA Office 
of Finance and Management does not feel that we are 
understaffed. That's just frank. The controller workforce plan 
that they have presented to you this year actually reduces our 
numbers.
    This is in a small workforce. We have 1,000 less certified 
professional controllers than we had a decade ago. We only have 
10,700 controllers. Removing 10 to 12 percent of that, it's not 
sustainable.
    So, getting people to apply generally isn't the problem. 
Moving it from the failed FAA Office of Finance and Management 
model to what is in your bill is a major solution.
    Mr. Stanton. Thank you.
    I yield back. Thank you.
    Mr. Yakym. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia, Mr. Collins.
    Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think there has 
been one common theme that I have heard over and over and over, 
and that is modernizing and modernization. And it is true. And 
it is not just in aviation, but it is in the entire Federal 
Government. And I don't think it can be said enough, Mr. 
Chairman, and we need to say it over and over and over again 
that, yes, this committee unanimously passed a great bill, and 
it passed the House overwhelmingly.
    But, you all, I don't know what is going on in the Senate. 
I mean, they must have one whale of a pickleball tournament 
going on over there, because they certainly aren't getting 
anything done. I mean, they have got bills stacking up 
everywhere. And if I seem frustrated, yes, I am a little 
frustrated because I actually had an amendment in the FAA 
reauthorization, too, that studies hypersonics and getting it 
incorporated into the national airspace. And this amendment 
addresses a number of things we can't say enough: workforce 
provisions, airport improvements, policies to help our general 
aviation community.
    So, Mr. Bunce, the Senate's delay in passing this 
reauthorization bill, what FAA modernization provisions are 
most pressing and need to get done now? And I know you have 
said it, but I think it just needs to be said over and over 
again.
    Mr. Bunce. To be able to keep pace with technology, the FAA 
has to have nimbleness in its rulemaking. By bringing an 
Associate Administrator for rulemaking that this bill does, 
elevates the importance of being able to get rules, policy, and 
guidance out. We think that's very important, and I think the 
Senate has similar provisions that are able to support that.
    Likewise, what the House bill has done is also create a 
Deputy Administrator for safety and operations. I think that is 
extremely critical, because when we have a change in 
administration or we have FAA Administrators that finish their 
term, we need that continuity and stability to be in place, to 
be able to go and keep all of the metrics that are required by 
all of the different parts of the FAA to be able to hum along 
and not have to reinvent the wheel every time we have a new 
Administrator and Deputy Administrator.
    And then the emphasis that we have on technology there and 
the training of the workforce is so vitally important. We have 
got to be able to have a workforce that is able to understand 
the technology and to be able to certify it. And that 
certification delays and everything puts us behind.
    If we are talking about hypersonics, which we all support, 
that is a holy grail to be able to get there. We have got to be 
able to do also supersonics. But the rigor that is required and 
the expertise that is not resident in the FAA right now would 
make certifying that type of technology extremely difficult, 
and this bill helps address that.
    Mr. Collins. I appreciate it.
    Mr. Bradbury, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International 
Airport, the world's busiest airport, right now they have got a 
multibillion-dollar modernization project going on that is 
going to help improve efficiency and customer service. How is 
delaying this reauthorization of the FAA going to affect those 
projects?
    Mr. Bradbury. I'm sorry, I missed the last part of that.
    Mr. Collins. How is the delay going to affect those 
projects?
    Mr. Bradbury. Oh, it is critical. And again, it is both 
operational and, for us, seasonal. So, there are very tight 
construction schedules around the summer season for us that we 
have to get the work done. And if we don't have a 
reauthorization bill, and it's continuing resolutions, there is 
no guarantee that we will have the funding in place to get 
these really important projects underway and moving forward.
    Mr. Collins. I agree with you 100 percent. I have been to 
the airport, been to the tower.
    Mr. Santa, I just want to finish up with a comment. I have 
been to TRACON in South Atlanta, met with the air traffic 
controllers. Great people. A lot of them are veterans, very 
proud of what they do.
    But I am going to tell you something. There are two things. 
NOTAM, yes, it failed. It is 30-year-old software. And instead 
of our FAA concentrating on improving that software, what did 
they do? They spent tens of thousands of dollars to write a 
179-page ruling to change it from Notice to Airmen, to Notice 
to Air Missions, and it certainly didn't make it any safer, 
because it failed.
    And the other thing I would like to say is the fact that we 
have an FAA that is more focused on hiring people based on DEI 
and wokeness instead of qualifications is one of the main 
reasons that you are seeing a lot of your air traffic 
controllers retire or quit, because they don't want to be 
responsible when someone comes in and something drastic happens 
because we have an FAA that is being led by a Secretary of 
Transportation, Pete Buttigieg, who is totally unqualified, has 
no idea what he is doing, and is pushing nothing but a 
socialistic experiment on an industry that he doesn't know 
anything about.
    And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. 
Collins. I recognize the gentlelady from Kansas, Ms. Davids, 
for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Davids of Kansas. Thank you, Chairman Garret Graves and 
Ranking Member Cohen, for holding this hearing today. And thank 
you also to Chairman Sam Graves and Ranking Member Larsen for 
their leadership on passing a commonsense reauthorization of 
the Federal Aviation Administration in the House.
    Like many across the country, my holiday travel last year 
was impacted by some of the widespread flight delays and 
cancellations that we saw. And while our country's skies are 
absolutely the safest in the world due to the hard work of our 
pilots and air traffic controllers, flight attendants, ground 
crews, and more, we have seen a troubling uptick in the near 
collisions at airports in our country, and these kinds of 
disruptions have become far too frequent, costing travelers 
both time and money.
    And this year, House Republicans and Democrats came 
together without theatrics to pass a bipartisan piece of 
legislation to reauthorize the FAA. The bill contains 
provisions that are going to have a huge impact on our flying 
experience as well as the economy, not just in my district, but 
across the country.
    And as a member of this committee, I have been working hard 
to ensure that the voices of the constituents in my district in 
Kansas are heard during this process. And while I was glad that 
the measures to protect Kansans' financial security and safety 
and to boost domestic manufacturers made it into the final 
bill, the reauthorization that we passed here hasn't been taken 
up by the Senate, which we have heard from multiple of my 
colleagues.
    The reauthorization we passed included consumer protections 
that require airlines to reimburse passengers for unexpected 
meal and hotel costs, and to establish policies allowing 
passengers to sit next to their young children. It also 
contains improved safety standards for air travel to help 
decrease airport near collisions, to review airplane emergency 
medical kits, evacuation procedures, and improve cabin air 
quality.
    And also, we saw the reauthorization in a bipartisan way 
uplift our local aviation workforce, boost domestic 
manufacturing, which is especially important in my State of 
Kansas, where we have a really strong legacy of aviation.
    And finally, this bill is going to improve and promote 
hiring of more air traffic controllers and strengthen the 
talent pipeline for pilots, maintenance technicians, and 
aviation manufacturing workers. And all of this is good stuff.
    There are, of course, pieces of the legislation that I 
disagree with. I am sure there are pieces of the legislation 
that my colleagues disagree with. But the nature of coming 
together in a bipartisan way requires that we figure out how to 
get that done. And we all understand the benefits of a strong 
system to ensure that our economy continues to move forward.
    Passage of the FAA bill is exactly how our Federal 
Government should be operating. We saw that here in this 
committee, people from both parties coming together to find 
solutions to some of the most pressing issues that we are 
facing as a country. Pragmatism, compromise: these are things 
that make this work possible, and we have gotten to see that 
here. I really hope that the Senate will consider the version 
of the FAA reauthorization that we have put forward, and I will 
look forward to working on a final compromise with what they do 
end up getting done.
    Mr. Bunce, I do want to chat with you for a moment about 
the FAA reauthorization that we passed and the provisions that 
focus on strengthening the safety workforce, improving the 
agency's rulemaking, which I have heard from you about today, 
even. And I would love to hear a bit more about the provisions 
in the House version of the bill that you see as improving the 
industry's safety and competitiveness in this increasingly 
competitive global market that we are in.
    Mr. Bunce. Thank you, Ms. Davids. First of all, thank you 
for your emphasis on advanced air mobility. Things like mobile 
clearances, that's going to be able to facilitate the ability 
to get these vehicles into the airspace.
    But again, as I mentioned earlier, the rulemaking itself, 
policy and guidance needs to be more nimble and streamlined 
because we are losing our edge in the world environment when 
other authorities can be able to promulgate rulemaking much 
faster. And we all know we have to comply with the 
Administrative Procedure Act, but we have got to be able to 
audit our processes, be able to look at it and look at what 
other Federal agencies do to be able to have more nimble 
rulemaking to get through the process. Sometimes it is taking 
5, 6 years, and the advanced rulemaking just sits on the shelf 
while other countries take what was done and are able to apply 
it.
    So, that and the emphasis on technology and on workforce, 
all of the things that have been mentioned in this hearing so 
far, are so critical to maintain our safety and to be able to 
improve as we put more vehicles into the airspace.
    Ms. Davids of Kansas. Thank you. And thank you to all of 
our witnesses for being here today and emphasizing the 
importance of this work.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Ms. Davids. I recognize 
the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Van Drew, for 5 minutes.
    Dr. Van Drew. Thank you, Chair. I am in strong support of 
passing a comprehensive and long-term FAA reauthorization. In 
the House bill, we have secured a number of big wins for the 
United States of America.
    I am most proud to say that our bill makes the William J. 
Hughes Technical Center permanently located in southern New 
Jersey, and more specifically, dedicated to advanced aerospace. 
The newly named FAA Technical Center for Advanced Aerospace 
will provide steady jobs, and most importantly, an opportunity 
for technical advancement aimed at bettering the safety and the 
capabilities of air travel. It's important.
    Also important is the amendment that will improve the 
protections for people with disabilities in our travel 
industry. The air travel experience should be a pleasant and 
safe one for everyone, for all people, so, ensuring quality 
access is of utmost importance.
    American aviation today faces numerous problems, ranging 
from air traffic controller shortages, safety issues with 
documented near-misses of aircraft, a rising number of 
cancellations, and our inability to keep up with advancing 
technology. Staffing shortages are plaguing aviation. This not 
only has detrimental impacts on our economy and the labor 
workforce, but also the safety capabilities of our aviation 
industry. This is serious stuff.
    Specifically relating to the staffing shortages, Mr. 
Santa--and I have to digress for a minute. I love your name, 
man. Santa. It's perfect for this time of year. You're just too 
skinny.
    Mr. Santa. Thank you.
    Dr. Van Drew. Do you ever have fun with it?
    Mr. Santa. Never, ever.
    Dr. Van Drew. Never?
    [Laughter.]
    Dr. Van Drew. Well, see--OK. I am, right now. If I were 
you, I would. But anyhow, I've got to get on. These questions 
are for you.
    What are the safety implications of the staffing shortages, 
and what can be done to ensure that safety isn't further 
affected?
    Mr. Santa. As I have said numerous times before, safety is 
our priority. No matter what the staffing at the facility 
levels are, no matter how critically staffed we are, and no 
matter what plan the FAA Office of Finance and Management puts 
out to reduce our numbers, safety is our priority. We are proud 
of it. We are professionals. We are dedicated to our skills. 
And it takes a lifetime to learn how to become a good 
controller. You are continually getting better.
    So, with that priority focus, the capacity is reduced, 
obviously. With single-sector positions, and with the increase 
in traffic by new users--general aviation is up, cargo is 
obviously up--the deficiency comes in. You just can't work that 
much traffic with the understaffed situations in our 
facilities. But safety is always a priority.
    Dr. Van Drew. And we can't say it too many times. What role 
has the FAA Office of Finance and Management played in the 
current controller staffing model? What is their role?
    Mr. Santa. The biggest detriment is the staffing model that 
the FAA Office of Finance and Management employs. They report 
to industry and to Congress a much healthier situation than is 
actually out there. Last year, they reported our facilities at 
102 percent staffed by using erroneous and flawed information. 
Our facilities are not 102 percent staffed. They are critically 
staffed. We are thousands below even an old, 10-year-old 
number.
    And the new CRWG numbers that desperately need to be 
implemented, they have been jointly collaborated. The FAA's ATO 
and NATCA collaborated on these numbers. The experts in the 
facilities collaborated and determined these numbers as what is 
needed to service the industry, service the traffic, and the 
FAA has refused to implement those. And that is why this bill 
is so important.
    Dr. Van Drew. I appreciate your answers. And the bill is 
important, man. We've got to get moving--not us. But we have 
heard that theme over and over and over today about the Senate. 
I hope they watch this hearing. If Congress doesn't pass a 
long-term funding solution to the FAA, America is at risk of 
losing its competitive edge in our tech race against China, 
which is real.
    Mr. Bunce, the aviation system continues to evolve daily, 
and important innovations are being made in the industry, from 
drones to advanced air mobility. The American aviation industry 
is moving fast, yet the Government remains stuck in time. What 
are the ramifications for the advanced air mobility industry, 
specifically--specifically--if this FAA reauthorization 
legislation is not enacted in a timely manner?
    Mr. Bunce. Sir, if we look at the opportunity that advanced 
air mobility gives us--and again, a lot of emphasis is on the 
vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, but it is also the 
electrification. If you think about a spinning turbine and the 
amount of electricity you can generate off of it, you can 
augment thrust.
    And I read with great interest, COMAC, which is a 
Government-supported program in China, just put forward a 19-
passenger aircraft using that type of technology, the electric 
augmented thrust. And so, this bill gives direction to the FAA 
to be able to work with industry collaboratively on advancing 
these technologies. The tech center plays an incredible role.
    In fact, I hope that we, after this bill is complete, we 
can get together industry and the Government and be able to 
have also NASA bring in their long-term program to be able to--
how they are supporting industry in advanced air mobility and 
merge those programs more collaboratively, because there is a 
lot of great work that the tech center could do in conjunction 
with what NASA can do to help further this and keep our global 
leadership in place.
    We are an aerospace nation. We need to stay that way.
    Dr. Van Drew. Thank you. And I want to thank Chairman Sam 
Graves, Ranking Member Cohen, Chairman Garret Graves, and 
Ranking Member Larsen, and this entire committee, and all of 
you. You have done good work on it.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you. Mr. Van Drew, Mr. 
Cohen, I hear you all continuing to make reference to Mr. Santa 
and fun of his name during the holiday season, everything else. 
I am really not sure what you all were taught as kids. The last 
name is ``Claus.'' I just want to, for the record, make that 
clear.
    With that important clarification, Mr. Garcia, you are 
recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Chairman Graves and the 
ranking member, for this hearing.
    The House passed the FAA bill, which contains, of course, 
priorities that I was proud to advocate for, including a long-
overdue increase in AIP and workforce development funding and 
improved consumer protection measures. As my colleagues have 
stated, it is critical for the safety of the aviation industry 
and the American public to expeditiously pass a bipartisan FAA 
bill, but we cannot do so at the expense of our airport 
workers.
    Airport workers, many of them who are women, Latino, and 
Black, work grueling hours for poverty pay to keep our airports 
running. And they deserve better. That is why I introduced the 
Good Jobs for Good Airports Act, which would provide livable 
wages and benefits for these workers. Although not included in 
the House-passed bill, it is important to keep fighting for 
strong labor protections during future negotiations. This 
includes guarding against provisions that could unravel hard-
won labor agreements like a pilot retirement age increase.
    Mr. Peterson, can you talk about how bolstering airport 
worker wages and labor protections can benefit airports writ 
large?
    Mr. Peterson. Sure. So, first, let me say that we support 
your legislation on the workers' wages.
    One of the things that we do see is a heavy turnover in the 
groups that you spoke about. They start working in the job, and 
then they leave the job because other things become available. 
They are often lower paid than a lot of their peers in other 
industry, it is costly to get to the airport, and things of 
that nature.
    So, again, having legislation that provides workers with 
good pay and good benefits is critical. Obviously, our belief 
would be that if all of them joined the union, we would fight 
for that. But with legislation like yours, getting that in 
place for sustainability is critical. And that is a baseline, 
obviously. Some high-cost areas are already doing that. They 
have to do that because they just can't get anybody to come 
work there. So, we absolutely appreciate that.
    Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Well, thank you for your answer. In 
your written testimony you mentioned that airlines are pressing 
Congress to preempt State and local labor laws that govern 
minimum wage, meal, and rest breaks, and family and sick leave, 
which builds on their local efforts to exclude airline workers 
from these laws. Why would excluding airline workers from the 
State and local labor laws be disastrous for the current and 
future generations of airline workers?
    And how does the House-passed bill reaffirm the right of 
States and localities to set higher labor standards?
    Mr. Peterson. Yes, again, I think it goes back to, if 
everybody that lives somewhere has a certain set of rules or 
laws that apply to them, to exclude airline workers to me seems 
preposterous because of the industry we work in. Granted that 
some people--and let me say this, the airlines that have been 
fighting this for a while have not been successful in their 
litigation on that.
    Somebody that is a flight attendant, for example, saying, 
well, you live here, but the law doesn't apply to you because 
you are flying to another State--that is their job. Or are a 
pilot. Again, that is the issue at hand, is: Why would I stay 
in this industry?
    And taking a step back, let's just use a flight attendant. 
The flight attendant field has become somewhat controversial. I 
talk to a lot of flight attendants today that say, ``I wouldn't 
want my son or daughter to become a flight attendant'' because 
of what they have seen happening in the industry recently. So, 
taking away laws that everybody else has, if you are hearing 
that from the current flight attendants--and we don't represent 
pilots, but I am sure there is a similar philosophy there--that 
if you are hearing that from flight attendants today, how do 
you get people to come into the industry if they can go work 
somewhere else and get the benefits of State laws that are in 
place?
    And so, that is why this is critical.
    Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you very much.
    And, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, I appreciate it, Mr. 
Garcia. I am going to recognize myself for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Bunce, in your testimony you made reference to 
certification challenges in regard to technology. I met with a 
manufacturer this week that made similar references to some of 
the delays and inability to get important technology certified. 
You similarly made reference to the fact that the FAA is not 
actually in-house working, and our bill does attempt to address 
that. Have your members reported many experiences about delays 
or lack of capacity that is impacting the ability to implement 
or update technology that could bring greater efficiency, 
safety, and other improvements to the aviation sector?
    Mr. Bunce. Mr. Chairman, I hear about it every single day, 
and it is the one issue that frustrates and confounds my 
membership on a daily basis. If we don't have an efficient 
certification process, and we have delay after delay, you are 
trying to develop new product, and what happens is a lot of 
times--I had one of our major aviation companies say, ``Pete, I 
know I've got technology out there right now that will not 
allow an aircraft to crash unless the engines are totally 
disabled,'' and yet he doesn't even move it forward because he 
said, ``I know I can't get it through the certification process 
in the amount of time that I can recoup the investment on 
engineering.'' So, it is truly debilitating our workforce and 
our ability to advance technology when we can't get through the 
certification process.
    Let me give you another example. We validated a product 
coming from Europe on an aircraft, and the exact same--and it 
was a nacelle issue, the area that surrounds an engine. The 
same manufacturer provides the engine and nacelle for a U.S. 
product, but we did delay after delay and an unbelievable 
amount of testing when we already validated the product coming 
in from Europe.
    So, not only do we have a problem with an inability to make 
decisions, but also, we don't look at decisions that we have 
already made and say, OK, our foreign authorities certified 
that, now we've got the same manufacturer here, why are we 
going through a process that takes well over a year to look at 
the exact same thing?
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Yes, thank you. And Colonel Bunce, 
if you have specific recommendations on particular parts of the 
certification, like policy office or others that you think 
would benefit from in-person work, I would love to get that 
from you in writing.
    Mr. Santa, you discussed in your testimony at length the 
need to address the lack of capacity with air traffic 
controllers. Our bill does step in and attempt to address that, 
to force the FAA to hire more controllers and to address the 
projected shortfalls in the FAA workforce, and requires 
assessment looking at future training, as well.
    The FAA, as I noted in my opening statement, recently 
received a pretty jarring report from the SRT, the Safety 
Review Team, and there was a response to the recommendations 
stating that the agency is expanding the use of advanced 
training and beginning to deploy simulators for the use in 
controller curriculum that increase capacity and leverage 
benefits, putting controllers in specific facility environments 
sooner. What are your thoughts on the use of simulators to 
improve training or adding capacity?
    Mr. Santa. Anything that creates efficiencies is welcomed, 
but we cannot degrade standards or qualifications or 
certifications. It is a professional job that takes a lot of 
skill, and there is no substitute for working the traffic. That 
can never be explained away or technology can replace that.
    But really, it is indicative of the bigger problem, masking 
the problem, not identifying that we have a staffing shortage, 
and trying to explain it away by different options and 
different ideas instead of adopting the CRWG numbers like this 
bill does, and doing maximum hiring for the duration of this 
bill. Just a few days ago, they have agreed that maybe we can 
do maximum hiring for 3 years. It doesn't work. They are 
unwilling to move off of the FAA Office of Finance and 
Management model, which has failed us.
    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you. I know a number of 
Members here have some tight timelines. I have got some more 
questions, but I am going to submit them for the record for the 
other members of the panel.
    I do want to thank you all for being here. And with that, I 
go to my friend from Nevada, Ms. Titus, for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Titus. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    I represent Las Vegas, and the airspace over my district is 
very busy and getting more crowded. You have got all of the 
commercial airlines coming into McCarran. This was our busiest 
month. In October, almost 5\1/2\ million. You have got all the 
private jets coming for the big events like F1 and the Super 
Bowl. They are using Henderson and North Las Vegas. You have 
got helicopters taking tours to the Grand Canyon. You have got 
Nellis Air Force Base, and you have got casinos using drones to 
deliver drinks by the pool. So, it's everything.
    Now, I want to speak to you, Mr. Santa. It is distressing 
to say you have 1,000 fewer than you had 10 years ago, and you 
will only have 200 more 10 years from now. But we are getting 
more people in the skies. Can you just say one more time for 
the record how important it is to keep up with that demand in 
air traffic controllers?
    Mr. Santa. Well, first of all, I want to personally thank 
you for your amendment. It will serve air traffic controllers 
well by maximum hiring.
    But Las Vegas is one of the hottest spots in the country. 
Their numbers being 10 years old, their staffing numbers, they 
have requested--they have put joint recommendations together. 
Their numbers are way too low.
    Ms. Titus. Yes.
    Mr. Santa. The new CRWG numbers address that. The FAA is 
unwilling to completely adopt them and put them into the 
controller workforce plan. It is creating challenges 
specifically at Las Vegas, among other facilities across the 
NAS. Ten years is a lifetime in this industry, and specifically 
for Vegas, as you have said, with the F1 race----
    Ms. Titus [interrupting]. Or international flights, too.
    Mr. Santa. All the international flights, they did have 
some of the busiest traffic and they are servicing that airport 
the best they can with critically understaffed needs--measures.
    Ms. Titus. What are your members doing to be--I hate the 
term--but ``proactive'' and encouraging ways to improve the 
situation, either airport improvements or all--instead of just 
reacting to an incident?
    Mr. Santa. We have a lot of programs: ATSAP, which is a 
voluntary reporting to report issues before they become 
chronic. VSRP does similar--a similar goal. And we are part of 
the solution. We are collaborative. NATCA members are tasked, 
and they should be collaborative with all of the solutions at 
the facility. The major situation specifically in Vegas and 
many of our facilities across the country is critical staffing. 
We have tried to be collaborative, and we are.
    The FAA's ATO, the Air Traffic Organization, and NATCA 
jointly developed new staffing numbers that were degraded by 10 
years, and they will not be implemented by the FAA at this 
point.
    Ms. Titus. Thank you.
    I am going to ask any of you this. I know the airline 
industry is--well, aviation generally--is moving to more 
sustainable flights, and we need the infrastructure to support 
that. I saw where Virgin Atlantic just flew from London to JFK 
on totally green fuel. Can you talk about how that will not be 
able to move forward if we don't get this bill passed, Mr. 
Bunce or Mr.--anybody?
    Mr. Bunce. Well, I think the support that the bill gives to 
be able to keep the momentum going on sustainable aviation fuel 
or on the piston side of the house to eliminate avgas is very 
important.
    But also, if you look at the infrastructure improvements 
that we can make to airports, we have got a pilot program that 
you call for in the bill to be able to go and look at the 
electrification, because we are going to have to be able to 
charge a lot of these new vehicles, but also the ground vehicle 
infrastructure that we have at each one of our airports. So, 
that is really forward thinking. And it is very critical in 
aviation. We don't care on the auto side of that house, our 
trucks, about how really heavy batteries are. But it is all 
about weight for aviation.
    The incredible rotorcraft community that you have there at 
Las Vegas that allows Americans to go over our precious 
resource, the national parks and that, we want to be able to 
move that forward. We can electrify the tail boom and reduce 
all the mechanical linkages of tail rotor and that by using the 
energy of the spinning turbine motors that are driving the main 
rotor shaft. Those types of things are facilitated by looking 
at technology, and we are very appreciative of what's in the 
bill to help that.
    Ms. Titus. Thank you. Well, thank you.
    And Mr. Chairman, I would also point out how bipartisan 
this was. I worked with Mr. Van Drew, Mr. Yakym--oh, well, he 
is gone--but anyway, Mr. Graves, on a number of these 
provisions, and I really hope to see them be enacted because I 
think they are improvements to the system.
    Thank you very much, and I yield back.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer [presiding]. Thank you, Ms. Titus. And 
with that, I would like to recognize my colleague from Florida, 
Mr. Bean.
    Mr. Bean of Florida. A very good morning to you, Madam 
Chair. Good morning, Aviation Subcommittee. It is great to see 
you. You guys at the witness table have done an outstanding 
job. You have sold us. We are in.
    I have been here 11 months. Let me tell you what I have 
learned. I have learned that this committee is the most 
bipartisan committee, and there is agreement that we can do so 
much better. We are doing great now, but we can do so much 
better if we made changes. What if we had a bill that made 
changes and improved manufacturing and labor and the air 
traffic control and airports? We do, we just passed one. So, 
what I have discovered, we are the choir. We are the choir you 
are preaching on. Preach on, witnesses, and preach on, 
committee members. So, I am all in, if anybody is keeping 
track. I think everybody has said we are all in. We need it 
because it is just an opportunity to make things better.
    My thought is, I know that they have very big desks in the 
Senate. Chuck Schumer has got a big desk because I know 
somewhere on his desk is this FAA bill. Is it possible he just 
doesn't know it's there? Is that possible, that he just doesn't 
know? Is it possible he's just so busy? Does he realize how 
important air travel is? Maybe he takes the train, I don't 
know. We've got a big crowd here today, we've got big 
committees. Maybe somebody here who knows him personally can 
poke him or give him a note to say, hey, have you looked on 
your desk? Because there is a bill that will definitely improve 
air travel and make it safe.
    I have also discovered this. I have flown. I have never 
flown as much as I have in the 11 months that I have been in 
Congress. And I now know, having toured the FAA Air Route 
Traffic Control Center in Jacksonville, which has a--I know we 
have talked about how big Nevada is, but Florida and the 
corridor and the Space Coast and the weather presents its own 
challenges. Everybody, when you are on a plane now, just know 
that there is somebody watching over you. There is an air 
traffic controller watching over you, and we just take it for 
granted that they are well rested and they are not overworked. 
And so, I am grateful for them.
    We are just grateful that the airport is going to receive 
us, and they are not going to be overworked or have the space 
or the concrete is going to be just right, and all the 
standards, and workers, and so many things. So, if we don't 
pass this bill, or if we extend it, we are missing an 
opportunity. We are missing an opportunity to go forward.
    My question to Mr. Santa is the contract program is a great 
program. This is the Contract Tower Program. We have got 262 
small airports across the country participating in it. I have 
got several in my district, Cecil and Craig Airports. If we 
don't pass it, if we just punt and not score the touchdown with 
it, how does that affect--what is our plan? What say you, Mr. 
Santa?
    Mr. Santa. Thank you for the question. Thank you for the 
support for JAX, as well. That facility is in a critically 
staffed nature, as well. It is critical to the east coast 
traffic, and they are doing a phenomenal job with no resources. 
So, thank you for that.
    FAA Contract Tower Program services our smallest 
facilities, right? General aviation, busy facilities, flight 
schools. Mr. Bunce and I both are pilots, and we use those 
airports. My home airport is actually under the Federal 
Contract Tower Program. And with the reauthorization lapse, 
those programs are suspended, so, the service and the safety 
that you would expect into those airports is lessened.
    Mr. Bean of Florida. Ten-four, ten-four. I am almost out of 
time, but everybody here, if you are sitting out in the 
audience, you are part of the T&I Aviation Subcommittee family. 
So, together, maybe we can get the word to people with the big 
desks that have so much going on to say let's take the one out 
that says FAA reauth, and let's put that on the hot burner.
    Mr. Chairman, with my last little bit of time I want to ask 
for unanimous consent on a part of Mr. Santa's written 
testimony.
    In your written testimony, which I have read, you have a 
section that says how important air traffic control is to this 
bill. That provision was inserted.
    And with your permission, Madam Chair, and unanimous 
consent, I would like for that section of Mr. Santa's testimony 
to be now known as the Santa clause.
    I yield back.
    [Laughter.]
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Well, without objection, so ordered, 
Mr. Bean.
    With that, my friend from California, Mr. Carbajal. Follow 
that.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. As long as it is Santa clause, but 
not DeSantis-something, that might work.
    Mr. Bunce, I appreciate your testimony highlighting the 
importance of technology and innovation. One of the provisions 
that I worked on with Representative Yakym and Davids was a 
pilot program to deliver clearances via mobile devices. This is 
intended to help modernize our technology and air traffic 
control towers and deliver more efficient digital clearances to 
aircraft through internet protocol for general aviation and on-
demand part 135 air operators.
    Mr. Bunce, can you expand upon how this would work from a 
user perspective, and, Mr. Santa, from an air traffic 
perspective?
    Mr. Bunce. Yes, Mr. Carbajal. If you look at what you 
provided in those provisions, we have worked very closely with 
Mr. Santa's organization. It is a very collaborative way to be 
able to take the technology that we have today, just the cell 
phone technology.
    When either of us fly and we file a flight plan, we get--
immediately on our cell phone--the routing that you are 
expected to get. But then we have to go on the radio, and we 
have to confirm that. And when you use the radio, you introduce 
a probability of error that you are going to copy something 
wrong in that. The technology exists today to be able to get 
that clearance, and to have it and acknowledge it back to Mr. 
Santa's controllers, and it's done. And it will make it safer.
    But also, think about now the advanced air mobility 
vehicles entering into the space. If they are in a very dense 
metropolitan area, right now, they are going to have to get on 
the radio or the cell phone--and probably the cell phone, 
because radio line-of-sight may not be working--to be able to 
get to the controlling agency to be able to say, ``I need 
clearance for takeoff.'' With this technology, we will be able 
to do that electronically, and it will make the system work. 
Otherwise, it is going to bog down with just calls.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
    Mr. Santa?
    Mr. Santa. I just want to add we heard a lot about 
bipartisanship, and this industry works on collaboration. Mr. 
Bunce and I--whether it is a CEO of an airline, whether it is 
general aviation, cargo, whatever, we work on our issues. And 
all the technology, unfortunately, the FAA generally can't 
provide due to funding, we still work on it. We still embrace 
the technology that is available and the challenges that we 
face to try to serve the industry the best we can. And it is 
something that we are all proud of.
    And when we sit up here, we don't pre-plan this message or 
this status. It is in us because we do it and we live it every 
day.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. Continuing with you, Mr. Santa, 
one of the FAA's most successful Government-industry 
partnerships is the Contract Tower Program; 262 smaller 
airports across the country participate in this critically 
important air traffic safety program, including 21 in 
California, one of which, the SLO County Airport, is in my 
district. Can you comment on the importance of the Contract 
Tower Program to the national air transportation system?
    And what impact will there be on the program if FAA 
reauthorization is significantly further delayed into next 
year?
    Mr. Santa. Thank you. I have said many times before it 
services some of our smaller airports, and that is a little 
erroneous. Some of our Federal Contract Tower Programs and 
airports serve hundreds of thousands of airports a year. And 
that is essential to the safety, the efficiency, and the 
capacity of those airports, no matter where they are at.
    With the reauth lapse, those programs get stalled, they get 
on hold, and there is a real opportunity for them to be 
canceled. Losing service to those airports and those regions 
and those communities, it would damage the economy and this 
industry.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you very much.
    Madam Chair, I yield back.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you, Mr. Carbajal. With that, I 
will recognize Mr. Molinaro from New York for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Molinaro. Thank you, Madam Chair. I am often concerned 
in following Mr. Bean, so, I am glad to have a little bit of 
distance. I never know how he is going to ultimately land the 
plane. Today was no different.
    But thank you all for your participation. I also want to 
share a degree of frustration. I certainly know the Senate 
majority leader. I know he flies on a plane. I know he likes 
airports. I know he likes planes. I know he likes the industry. 
The fact that we have this hearing at all is entirely 
unnecessary, were the Senate just simply to move forward 
earnestly with the consideration of FAA reauthorization. And 
the failure to do so, quite frankly, does threaten a number of 
sectors within the industry. I want to start with one.
    The House reauthorization bill includes a provision, a bill 
that I worked on with the committee, that would help to 
accelerate the emergence of advanced air mobility. Mr. Bunce, 
you talked a bit about this already, but I would like to return 
to it because I see, in particular, electric vertical takeoff 
and vertical takeoff technology as having great benefit not 
only to those more congested airports, but also rural airports 
in places like upstate New York, where there are geographic and 
topographical challenges. I have an airport in the gorge of 
upstate New York, for instance, and being able to connect those 
smaller airports with regional airports will accelerate access 
to flight and greater transportation capacity.
    The provision specifically includes a new pilot program to 
grant funding to airports for expanded access to the electric 
aircraft charging equipment, which is necessary to make those 
important upgrades to allow for vertical takeoff. Mr. Bunce, if 
you could, could you just expand on what delays in at least 
reauthorization with this provision mean to the, in particular, 
eVTOL and VTOL technology, and the impact to airports 
specifically?
    Mr. Bunce. Well, sir, at this point in time, it is very 
critical for us to move out on advanced air mobility, and a 
delay in getting this reauthorization done is only going to 
exacerbate what has been created by the movement to what we 
call a powered-lift rating for new pilots in advance, 
especially these vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.
    So, not only will--the FAA Administrator, as I said 
earlier, has now a mandate from the overwhelming bipartisan 
support he had on his confirmation, and now he is got to be 
able to focus on areas like having the NextGen office, which is 
really the technology innovator, those that are starting to 
think about how we are going to provide the charging for 
multiple different types of aircraft made by different 
manufacturers to be able to charge the vehicles, and then have, 
coming from all of our different airports, the ability to get 
into the airspace.
    Remember, if we are able to do this properly, we can have 
small vertiports around that then transport, as you said, to 
maybe a reliever airport on the outside of a big city. That 
reduces then the regional transportation that is required at 
the hubs, because we can put the regional aircraft at these 
smaller reliever aircraft and increase our capacity at the 
hubs.
    So, the first step is allowing these airports to have a 
charging capability for electric aviation and electric 
vehicles.
    Mr. Molinaro. And I appreciate that. And as I said, the 
capacity to expand access in upstate New York and rural 
airports is very important.
    Mr. Bradbury, do you want to add to that? And if you don't 
mind, I want to get one last question in, so, briefly, if you 
could.
    Mr. Bradbury. Sure. I just want to say airports really 
appreciate the pilot program that you have established in this 
bill. It really will assist airports in eVTOL and advanced air 
mobility. It is very much appreciated.
    Mr. Molinaro. And I appreciate working with all of you.
    I also appreciate working with the folks at TWU. And Mr. 
Peterson, I am grateful that you are here. You are doing fine, 
by the way. I understand this might be your first time 
testifying before a congressional committee. Is that true?
    Mr. Peterson. That is correct.
    Mr. Molinaro. You are doing a great job.
    But I wanted to point to a piece of legislation that we 
crafted together, the Global Aircraft Maintenance Safety 
Improvement Act. As you know, America outsources, too often, 
repair. You have testified that China is the largest 
destination for offshore aircraft maintenance jobs. Could you 
just speak to the kind of maintenance work that is being 
performed on U.S. aircraft at facilities in China, and how this 
bill addresses that very dangerous status quo?
    Mr. Peterson. Sure. So, I think the first part of that is 
the main work being done in China is the heavy maintenance and 
overhaul, which is the behind-the-scenes, behind-the-panels 
opening up the aircraft, what the passenger and the flying 
public doesn't see. That piece of work, I would argue, is 
critical to the U.S. aviation industry.
    And to me, as a mechanic, knowing that the people that--our 
folks, when they work behind that, I know they are FAA 
certified, I know there are inspectors on the facility and 
whatnot. In China, I don't know who is working that aircraft. I 
don't know how they worked on the aircraft. And ultimately, 
when it lands back in the U.S. and I then take it over, I now 
become responsible for it.
    Mr. Molinaro. And I appreciate that. The fact that we don't 
have this global safety standard would surprise most passengers 
in this country. It is a pleasure to work with TWU and all of 
you on this.
    Mr. Peterson. Thank you.
    Mr. Molinaro. I yield back.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you, Mr. Molinaro. I will 
recognize Ms. Norton from the District for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Norton. I thank the chair and ranking member for 
holding this hearing to emphasize the importance of passing a 
long-term Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill 
soon.
    As the cochair of the Quiet Skies Caucus and the Member who 
represents the District of Columbia, which is plagued by 
aviation noise, I would like to use this opportunity to 
highlight two provisions I got included in the House-passed FAA 
reauthorization bill, the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership 
in American Aviation Act, to combat helicopter noise. 
Helicopter noise can harm health, quality of life, and the 
structural integrity of homes.
    In 2019, I led a request to the Government Accountability 
Office to conduct a study on helicopter noise in the national 
capital region. In 2021, GAO released its study and recommended 
that the FAA implement a noise-sharing mechanism for helicopter 
operators in the national capital region. In 2022, the FAA 
initiated a pilot program with a private company to create a 
helicopter noise-sharing mechanism in the national capital 
region. After the end of the pilot program, Fairfax and 
Arlington Counties contracted with the private company to 
maintain the mechanism, but solely for northern Virginia. The 
FAA fell well short of what GAO recommended.
    One provision in the bill would require the FAA within 180 
days to create and implement a helicopter noise-sharing 
mechanism for all helicopter operations in the national capital 
region, and to make the data collected accessible to the public 
online. This data would help us develop additional solutions to 
combat helicopter noise.
    The other provision in the bill would direct GAO to conduct 
a study on reducing the helicopter noise in DC, almost all of 
which is created by Government helicopters. The study would 
consider the extent to which military operators should continue 
operating over unpopulated areas outside of DC for training 
missions, the extent to which vehicles or aircraft other than 
helicopters could be used for emergency and law enforcement 
response, and the extent to which helicopter operators have 
assessed and addressed the noise impact of various factors of 
operating helicopters, including altitude, the number of 
flights, flightpaths, prime time of day of flights, type of 
aircraft, operating procedures, and pilot training.
    I would like to close by highlighting a provision I worked 
on to improve emergency medical equipment, including the 
contents of emergency medical kits and training required for 
flightcrew. Flightcrews should have the medication and training 
to address medical emergencies, including anaphylaxis, opioid 
overdose, and unique needs of children.
    I yield back my time, Madam Chairman.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you, Ms. Norton. With that, I 
will recognize my colleague from New York, Mr. D'Esposito, for 
5 minutes.
    Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, Madam Chair, and good afternoon, 
everyone. Thank you for being here.
    I want to start off with you, Mr. Santa. From reading your 
biography, I understand that you began your career at the New 
York TRACON facility in 1997. I want to thank you for your 
service there. And obviously, you are well aware of the issues 
that they are facing.
    TRACON N90, right in the center of my district, is probably 
one of the key facilities that directs planes and aircraft in 
and out of the New York metropolitan area. And obviously, 
despite the importance of this facility and the necessity of 
it, it is currently only half-staffed. And I actually have had 
the opportunity over the last few months to make a visit there 
and put the boots on the ground and talk to individuals who 
spend their days and nights in that facility. A very impressive 
facility, to say the least.
    Because it is only half-staffed, the FAA has extended cuts 
to minimum flight requirements and air traffic capacity at New 
York City area airports through October of 2024. So, I just 
have a few questions for you in regards to TRACON N90. The 
first is, can you describe in more detail how this substantial 
staffing shortfall has affected flight operations in New York?
    Mr. Santa. Absolutely. New York TRACON is critically 
staffed. And it is exceptionally important to the Northeast 
Corridor running Kennedy, Newark, LaGuardia operations, amongst 
other--White Plains, Teterboro, and all of the facilities up 
there that service corporate traffic, as well.
    The short staffing has taken a toll on overtime. Obviously, 
the 6-day workweeks and 10-hour days become the norm. It 
becomes difficult to continue normal operations of training, 
normal operations of enhancements, modernizing just airspace 
routing. And learning the complexity of that airspace becomes a 
challenge because you are always on. The expectation of those 
facilities and those airports is to keep capacity as high as 
you can, obviously, with no safety lapses.
    Mr. D'Esposito. Right. So, speaking of the safety lapses, 
obviously, with a short staff, there is tendency--I know that 
there are rules in place, but when I was there visiting and 
speaking to the leadership, the labor leadership, obviously, 
people that work there, they feel overworked. They are probably 
fatigued. For those who haven't visited one of these 
facilities, it is dark. Even in the middle of the day, you 
would think it is the middle of the night.
    Have there been any notable incidents that you would 
attribute to the staffing shortage at the N90 facility?
    Mr. Santa. Their professionalism up there and everywhere is 
unparalleled. They work, as many of our facilities do, long 
hours, extra overtime, and a lot of time on position. That 
facility specifically, if we want to talk about Newark, they 
have done an exemplary job of basically eliminating delays, 
eliminating delays due to staffing and costs due to staffing, 
just by tenacity and a lot of hard work and dedication to their 
trade.
    Mr. D'Esposito. Yes, they are phenomenal, and I was happy 
to be able to work with some of my colleagues during the 
preparation for the FAA reauthorization. There was a proposal 
to send some of the N90 workers to, I believe, Pennsylvania. 
And luckily, we were able to keep those jobs right in the 
district and right on Long Island.
    You also--or someone--mentioned that the staffing gap would 
probably take 5 years to close. As a temporary fix, what steps 
do you suggest that the FAA can take to enable flights at New 
York City airports to be at full capacity once again?
    Mr. Santa. Well, unfortunately, the FAA was lapsed in the 
law to do local hiring. For years, they didn't employ that law. 
And just recently, they put a bid out and I think they got over 
300 qualified candidates. Hire those candidates into New York 
TRACON and New York Center. Both of those facilities 
desperately need them. They can start training. They can return 
back to some normalcy on their shifts because they are 
aggressively getting the job done there, whether it be 
training, servicing the industry, or maintaining the highest 
safety standards that they need to.
    Mr. D'Esposito. Well, thank you very much. And I know that 
we have talked about all morning that the expiration at the end 
of the year would be devastating. Obviously, the CR for 
transportation expires in January.
    And I think it is a common theme, one that was mentioned by 
both my colleague from New York, Mr. Molinaro, and Mr. Bean 
from Florida. The facts are simple. We have a good piece of 
bipartisan legislation. And unfortunately, it is following the 
same route as much other good legislation like our Secure the 
Border Act that has been sent over to the Senate and is 
apparently collecting dust. So, I wish we didn't have to have a 
hearing like this, but I want to thank our leadership, and I 
hope that days like today maybe light a little fire on the 
other side of the house to get this piece of legislation off 
the desk and onto the floor so that you all and the people that 
you work with can continue the great work that you do. So, 
thank you all. Happy holidays.
    Madam Chair, I yield back.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you. With that, I will recognize 
Mr. Allred from Texas for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Allred. Sure. Well, thank you, Madam Chair, and thank 
you all for being here and putting up with our questions. This 
is a crucial moment for the FAA reauthorization process as we 
look to our colleagues in the Senate to take up our bill. And I 
really am proud, and I think you have seen a trend here of the 
bipartisan work that we did in this committee to try and make 
sure that we could secure the FAA going forward, but also air 
travel in general.
    Mr. Santa, I want to begin with you, and I know you have 
gotten a lot of attention here today for good reason. But 
controllers at the airports in my region in the DFW area are 
working, as you have talked about today, 6 days a week, 10 
hours a day. And we know that contributes to fatigue, to many 
things. And you have talked about the safety implications, I 
think, and you have discussed that in your testimony.
    If you could, talk about the personal impacts that has. 
Because in my experience, part of recruitment and retention is 
that a job is one that, yes, you can be compensated well for, 
but also that fits with a family. My wife and I have two small 
children, 4 and 2. If it doesn't work for your family, then it 
is hard to get new folks to come into a profession. So, what do 
you see as the personal impacts of this understaffing?
    Mr. Santa. Thanks for the question. I feel like I can talk 
about staffing crises at any facility that you bring up. And 
the Dallas area is one of the worst. You talk about Austin 
traffic, it is just exponentially higher.
    I do have a little story here, I think, that really 
epitomizes the problems that we have. And I will talk about the 
personal aspect. When you talk about ZFW, which is the Fort 
Worth Air Route Traffic Control Center, they have 253 certified 
controllers. Our interim number was 290. That is 10 years old. 
The new target number is 295. The FAA Office of Finance and 
Management actually cuts a 10-year-old number to 264. They are 
working 6-day workweeks, 10-hour days, and the FAA Office of 
Finance and Management says, ``You are pretty good.'' It is not 
where we are at.
    And you talk about the personal interactions. This is a 
full-time job, full-time career, shift work, midnights, 6-day 
workweeks, 10-hour days. Nothing works well when it is 
critically staffed. You miss ball games, you miss your kids' 
events, you miss family events. You miss holidays. We are 24/7. 
This Christmas, there are going to be dozens of people that 
don't get to wake up and open presents on Christmas because the 
staffing is abysmal.
    Specifically--and like I said, anybody that sits and talks 
to me, I can tell you a specific story about how short-staffed 
they are.
    Mr. Allred. Well, and so, the understaffing can lead to 
more understaffing, because then it is harder to get folks to 
come into it.
    Mr. Peterson, I wanted to turn to you, and I was so sorry 
to learn and hear--and I am glad that you mentioned in your 
testimony--about Michal Ingraham's death at the Austin airport 
in my home State. It is clear that ground workers play an 
indispensable role, from ensuring that baggage and cargo arrive 
at their intended destination to pushing back aircraft, and 
they should never face unnecessary dangers at their job. As you 
mentioned in your testimony, the House-passed bill requires the 
FAA to conduct a call-to-action review of ramp worker safety 
provisions. Can you expand on how that provision is vital to 
prevent tragic accidents and deaths like Michal's from ever 
happening again?
    Mr. Peterson. Sure, thank you. I think a couple things that 
are in the bill are critical.
    One is that management and labor get together and figure 
out what is going on. The area on the ground hasn't been looked 
at in years. And obviously, the tarmac has changed. DFW, where 
I am from, as well, is a great example of that, just the 
expansion and the constant evolution of these airports. And yet 
the ground equipment and the markings and all those things on 
the side where we work remains the same. So, just finding ways 
to improve that, finding ways to put in areas for more safe 
movement on the ramp are critical, putting in place rules that 
work. And nobody knows that better than the people that work on 
the ground.
    There is always this argument about cost that we always get 
into. You can't put a value on the cost of a life.
    Mr. Allred. That is right.
    Mr. Peterson. The incident in Austin should have never 
happened. That situation is one of--that is one that was fatal. 
We constantly have people getting injured or maimed for no 
reason because this infrastructure hasn't been looked at in 
years, and it needs to be addressed. And the bill provides for 
that, which, again, I thank the committee for that.
    Mr. Allred. Yes. Well, thank you, Mr. Peterson. Thanks to 
our witnesses.
    I yield back.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you, Mr. Allred. With that, I 
will recognize Mr. Perry for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Perry. I thank the chair and the ranking member for 
being open to diverse viewpoints. Thank you for being here, 
folks.
    The aviation industry is in a state of chaos, in my 
opinion. Near-misses on tarmacs, massive delays and 
cancellations, and industrywide workforce shortages with no end 
in sight. And I think we have kind of talked about all of them, 
but there has been a lot of back-slapping here today.
    So, I am going to ask unanimous consent to enter into the 
record the following articles: November 11, 2023, Daily Mail, 
``Exclusive: U.S. airlines set for worst year ever with more 
than 1 million departures delayed so far in 2023--nearly a 
quarter of all flights--fueling holiday chaos fears''; November

threaten aviation safety, report says''; September 15, 2023, 
Wall Street Journal, ``Staffing shortage at air traffic control 
means more cuts of New York flights''; and July 22, 2023, CNN, 
``U.S. airline staffing is at its `highest level' in decades. 
So why the flight delays?''
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Without objection, so ordered.

    <bullet>  More than one million flights were delayed from January 
to August, the fastest that the milestone has ever been reached, 
according to official departure data
    <bullet>  22.33 percent of departures in 2023 have been delayed by 
15 minutes or more
    <bullet>  The dismal figures come amid a series of other 
controversies this year, including mass cancelations, a shortage of 
pilots and a string of worrying near misses

    U.S. airlines are on course for one of the worst ever years for 
flight delays, according to official data reviewed by DailyMail.com.
    Airlines racked up a million delayed departures in record time in 
2023 and nearly a quarter of flights so far this year have taken off 
late, the figures reveal.
    The dismal data adds to a string of issues to blight the aviation 
industry this year, including mass cancelations, chronic staff 
shortages, a series of near-misses and the use of fake jet engine parts 
in dozens of large commercial aircraft.
    The findings will also fuel fears of travel chaos through the busy 
Thanksgiving period and holiday season, when tens of millions of 
Americans will fly around the country to celebrate with loved ones. A 
recent survey found half of Americans plan to book a flight or hotel 
this holiday, putting further strain on the struggling industry.
    DailyMail.com reviewed flight departure data from the Bureau of 
Transport Statistics, which tracks the country's leading carries. The 
bureau defines a delayed departure as one which leaves the gate 15 
minutes or more after its scheduled time.
    From January to August this year, the period for which the most up-
to-date data is available, 22.33 percent of flights were delayed. The 
total number of delayed departures was 1,015,057.
    The previous annual record was 2007, when 21.1 percent of flights 
were delayed, putting 2023 well on track to set a new record.
    The Bureau of Transport Statistics data includes annual breakdowns 
for every year from 1988 to the present day.
    The eight-months timespan that it took to hit one million delays is 
also believed to be the shortest on record. The previous record was in 
2007, when it took until September to pass one million delayed 
departures.
    Data for delayed arrivals paints a similarly bleak picture. Between 
January and August 2023, 22.52 percent of arrivals were late by 15 
minutes or more, the highest proportion for that period since at least 
2014.
    In 2007, the worst year for delayed arrivals, 24.20 percent of 
flights were delayed across the whole year.
    Separate data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics also 
reveals that as delays have risen, air ticket prices have crept above 
their pre-covid highs after a dip during the pandemic. Passengers now 
face paying more for a worse service.
    The average price of a domestic fare was $391.79 in the second 
quarter of 2023, compared with $357.07 for the same period in 2019.
    The dire delays statistics comes after a summer of chaos and misery 
and American airports due to a chronic staffing shortages post-COVID 
and extreme weather events.
    The Fourth of July holiday was blighted by thousands of 
cancellations. United Airlines was singled out for criticism after its 
passengers suffered most and many were left stranded in airports.
    Weeks earlier, storms around the east coast and Midwest also caused 
huge disruption and nearly 10,000 flights were canceled in a single 
week.
    Airlines started 2023 with a shortage of around 17,000 pilots, 
while the Federal Aviation Authority had a shortage of 3,000 air 
traffic controllers. There was also a shortage of thousands of 
mechanics.
    The industry typically trains about 1,500 to 1,800 new pilots each 
year. Training a pilot can also take two years or longer, and cost more 
than $100,000.
    The dire shortage of staff this year came about in part because of 
mass layoffs during COVID, which were not reversed quickly enough as 
the sector rebounded when lockdowns were lifted.
    After the chaos this summer, Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg 
opened a federal investigation into airlines for what he termed 
`unrealistic scheduling', or listing more flights than carriers can be 
safely operated.
    Officials from the Federal Aviation Administration, which sets 
safety guidelines for the industry, have also taken action after a 
concerning series of near misses at airports and in the skies this 
year.
    Bosses from the agency are holding `runway safety meetings' with 
air traffic controllers at the nation's most problematic airports after 
a spate that included 46 close calls in January alone.
    In the most serious incidents, aircraft carrying hundreds of 
passengers have come just within feet of a collision that could have 
caused a massive loss of life.
    And there was also widespread disbelief among industry insiders and 
the public in September when it emerged dozens of aircraft used by the 
country's leading carriers have been fitted with uncertified jet engine 
parts.
    A U.K.-based supplier, AOG Technics, allegedly sold parts with 
forged safety paperwork to jet engine maintenance firms and these parts 
ended up in at least 126 commercial aircraft.
    Leading American airlines including Delta and United have been 
forced to ground planes that were affected by the scandal and a 
worldwide investigation is underway to identify other aircraft fitted 
with the suspicious parts. Aircraft in Europe, Australia and China have 
also been affected.

  Article entitled, ``Staffing and Technology Woes Threaten Aviation 
  Safety, Report Says,'' by Mark Walker, New York Times, November 15, 
           2023, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Scott Perry
   Staffing and Technology Woes Threaten Aviation Safety, Report Says
by Mark Walker

New York Times, November 15, 2023
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/us/politics/air-traffic-safety-
faa.html

The Federal Aviation Administration turned to outside experts after a 
string of near collisions. They called for addressing the shortage of 
air traffic controllers and improving aging tech.

    A group of outside experts appointed by the Federal Aviation 
Administration called on Wednesday for ``urgent action'' to address 
safety risks in the nation's aviation system, highlighting issues like 
staffing shortages among air traffic controllers and outdated 
technology.
    The F.A.A. announced the formation of the group, the National 
Airspace System Safety Review Team, in April after a string of close 
calls at airports across the country, and the panel issued a 52-page 
report on Wednesday laying out its findings.
    In addition to calling for the F.A.A. to address the shortage of 
air traffic controllers and improve its aging technology, the report 
also recommended changes in how the agency is funded, such as more 
broadly shielding it from government shutdowns.
    ``The current erosion in the margin of safety in the N.A.S. caused 
by the confluence of these challenges is rendering the current level of 
safety unsustainable,'' the report said, referring to what is known as 
the National Airspace System.
    The group of experts was led by Michael P. Huerta, who served as 
F.A.A. administrator under Presidents Barack Obama and Donald J. Trump. 
It also included other former federal officials and former union 
leaders.
    ``There are no easy short-term fixes to address many of these 
challenges,'' Mr. Huerta told reporters on Wednesday. ``Addressing risk 
in the N.A.S. requires the F.A.A., the administration, Congress and 
others across industry to work together collaboratively.''
    Investigations published by The New York Times in August and in 
October revealed how the nation's vaunted aviation safety system is 
under mounting stress. The Times found that close calls involving 
commercial airlines had been happening, on average, multiple times a 
week.
    A dire shortage of air traffic controllers--The Times found that 99 
percent of the country's air traffic control facilities were 
understaffed--has been one major factor.
    The report released on Wednesday also warned about the risks posed 
by aging technology. In January, an F.A.A. system outage caused flights 
to be grounded nationwide and led to a wave of delays and cancellations 
for travelers.
    ``The age and condition of F.A.A. facilities and equipment are 
elevating system risk to unsustainable levels, even before considering 
losses in efficiency from outdated technology,'' the report said.
    The agency has said that it has taken steps to reduce the risk of 
close calls at airports, such as by providing funding to reconfigure 
taxiways and improve runway lighting.
    ``The F.A.A. welcomes the independent Safety Review Team's report, 
and we will thoroughly review the recommendations,'' the agency's new 
administrator, Michael G. Whitaker, whom the Senate confirmed last 
month, said in a statement. ``We appreciate the team's time and 
expertise to help us pursue our goal of zero serious close calls.''
    The near misses have also caught the attention of Congress. A 
Senate subcommittee held a hearing on the topic last week, and among 
the witnesses was Jennifer L. Homendy, the chairwoman of the National 
Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating a number of close-
call incidents.
    ``While these events are incredibly rare, our safety system is 
showing clear signs of strain that we cannot ignore,'' Ms. Homendy 
said.

control-means-more-cuts-of-new-york-flights-48a2fe7f

    A staffing shortage at a key New York air-traffic control facility 
will continue to disrupt travel through next fall, and airlines will be 
allowed to cut back on flying in the region for another year.
    Airlines were allowed to reduce schedules in the New York area all 
summer, after the Federal Aviation Administration said that a facility 
there had only 54% of the fully-trained controllers it needed. On 
Friday, the FAA said the facility still doesn't have enough certified 
controllers to handle normal traffic levels.
    The agency will allow airlines to forgo using up to 10% of their 
slots or runway timings through Oct. 26 next year at the three major 
airports serving New York City and for flights between New York and 
Washington D.C.'s Reagan National Airport.
    Without extending the flying cuts, the FAA said it would expect 
delays and cancellations in New York to increase. Normally, carriers 
that don't use their takeoff and landing rights at certain airports 
risk losing them. The FAA encouraged airlines to trim flying during the 
busiest, most congested times of day.
    Airlines for America, which represents major carriers, said it 
appreciated the extension.
    Despite the reduced flying, the New York area has been prone to 
significant flight disruptions, particularly when bad weather hits. 
United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby said the FAA's controller 
shortage is amplifying weather disruptions in the New York area.
    ``The impact of weather today is several times worse than it was 
historically,'' he said at an aviation event in Washington, D.C., this 
week. ``The same weather that in the past we could have managed though 
now can cause hundreds of delays--or hundreds of even cancellations.''
    Airlines had sought an extension of the cutbacks, saying they 
needed more notice to be able to plan their schedules. JetBlue Airways 
Chief Executive Robin Hayes said at the same event that even the 10% 
reduction hadn't been deep enough.
    ``Even on days where we saw industry cancel flights and weather 
move out, it took a long time to get going again,'' he said.
    The FAA said it is working with the union that represents air-
traffic controllers on a long-term solution to solve what it described 
as chronically low levels of fully certified controllers at the 
facility.

U.S. Airline Staffing Is at Its `Highest Level' in Decades. So Why the 
                             Flight Delays?
                            Air Travel Woes

CNN, July 22, 2023
https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/22/travel/travel-news-us-air-employment-
flight-delays/index.html

    U.S. passenger airline employment is now at its highest level in 
over two decades, says a new statement from the International Air 
Transport Association (IATA) as carriers build up their workforces to 
meet the huge demand for post-pandemic travel.
    However, passengers this summer are still facing ``unacceptable 
delays and disruptions'' because of a shortage of air traffic 
controllers in North America. The IATA, an industry association that 
represents the world's airlines, is blaming that squarely on ``poor 
planning'' by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and NAV 
Canada, the Canadian air navigation services provider. But outdated 
technology, airline staffing issues and bad weather are also playing 
into recent air traffic meltdowns, CNN has previously reported.
    There were more woes as medical teams were called to a passenger 
plane on the tarmac in Las Vegas to treat ``heat-related discomfort,'' 
and an emergency evacuation slide from a United flight fell into a 
Chicago neighborhood.
    If all this has got you wistful for a bygone ``golden age of air 
travel,'' however, you'd be very wrong. When it comes to safety, 
accessibility and affordability, we've never had it so good.

    Mr. Perry. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    We ought to be honoring the great, competent people that 
work in the industry and the deserving travelers they serve. 
And that includes you folks. We are the greatest country in the 
world, the literal birthplace of aviation. And we have the 
Government telling airlines to cut flights, causing massive 
delays that lead our constituents to be stuck in the airport 
for hours on end, if they are lucky enough to catch their 
flight at all.
    The situation is only going to get worse, due to a looming 
pilot shortage that, again, is largely the result of misguided 
regulations that hinder the ability of the free market to 
deliver the transportation experience our constituents deserve.
    These are the issues that we should have addressed in the 
FAA reauthorization bill. Instead, the House passed a bill that 
kicks the can down the road for 5 years and allows the 
situation to fester, killing industry efficiency and 
threatening airline safety, which is why I did not support the 
bill.
    While there are consequences to delaying the long-term FAA 
bill, the consequences of passing a bill that fails to remedy 
these significant threats to the industry may actually be 
worse. While there are some wins with the House-passed bill, 
this is the opportunity to put forth a truly transformational 
FAA reauthorization bill that allows the industry to adapt to 
the times and meet the moment, providing for the needs of the 
traveling public.
    Now, I don't know what the Senate is doing over there. God 
bless them. I hope they are doing that. I don't believe they 
are doing that, but I hope that is why there is a delay.
    But we can still do this if we go back to the drawing board 
and pass a bill that institutes real changes that will 
meaningfully address the following issues: increasing the pilot 
retirement age, a reform that was included in the House bill 
over the objections of the Big Four agreement; lowering the 
1,500-hour requirement for flight certification to increase the 
pipeline of new pilots entering the industry, and removing the 
politics surrounding that issue; expanding the number of 
certified instructors; eliminating much of the Essential Air 
Service program that misallocates precious resources, which are 
pilots, flightcrews, ground crews, fuel, mechanical equipment, 
and planes to routes that are not economically viable at the 
expense of profitable routes; increasing the air traffic 
controller retirement age; spinning off the air traffic control 
system into a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization similar 
to the situation in Canada that allows it to operate in an 
innovative, streamlined fashion; ensuring airline employees and 
air traffic controllers are hired based on merit and 
competence, rather than DEI metrics; and eliminating the 
wasteful Green New Deal programs at the FAA to ensure the 
agency remains focused on its mission, which is safe and 
efficient travel.
    Unfortunately, there are those in the administration, in 
industry, some in labor, some even folks that are working right 
here in the building who are benefiting from the status quo, 
and therefore seek to keep the system rigged in that favor, 
damn the consequences to our constituents, our bosses, and the 
flying public. We can, we should, and we must do better.
    I yield the balance, Madam Chair.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you, Mr. Perry. I will now 
recognize the acting ranking member, Ms. Scholten from 
Michigan, for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Scholten. Thank you so much to our chairman and acting 
chairwoman, and to our Ranking Member Cohen for holding this 
important hearing. And thank you so much to all of our 
witnesses for bearing with us and coming in here, helping us to 
draw attention to the critical urgency of reauthorizing the 
FAA.
    It bears repeating over and over and over again that the 
Senate's delay in passing the FAA reauthorization has created 
significant uncertainty for our aviation industry, and it is 
critical that this final authorization is passed by December 
31. The time is ticking. Any further delays would negatively 
impact safety, infrastructure, and operations for our Nation's 
airports.
    Of course, just like all of the Representatives here today, 
I am particularly concerned about what this means back home in 
west Michigan, impact on Gerald R. Ford International Airport 
and Muskegon County Airport in my district. They have benefited 
from the Airport Improvement Program funding, which is 
currently jeopardized. And I am particularly concerned about 
the impact and delays on these airports for these programs.
    Mr. Bradbury, you mentioned that short-term extensions 
hinder the distribution of AIP funding to airports, and 
airports must then choose one of three options. I want to get 
into that just a little bit more. How are airports affected if 
they choose to accept their grants based on prorated 
calculations, and how is that impact different if they choose 
to wait for a reauthorization, defer, or carry over their 
entitlements?
    Mr. Bradbury. Great questions. And obviously, with 
Michigan, also a very tight construction season. And that is 
the biggest impact for a lot of our northern tier airports when 
it comes to construction.
    And you can't prorate a project. That is the real 
unfortunate part. And I spoke in my testimony that it is a 15- 
to 20-percent cost every time you remobilize. So, it is 
inefficient, it is very inefficient. And it causes construction 
costs increases, which are really difficult for the industry 
and ultimately hold up a project.
    Ms. Scholten. Thank you. Essential testimony for our 
record. Thank you so much.
    Mr. Peterson, I want to talk about safety a minute. Like 
you, I am deeply concerned about the impacts of the delay that 
they have on safety for our workers. I am concerned not only 
for the workers themselves, but as a lawmaker and a protector 
of my constituents, I am concerned about their safety. And 
frankly, as a frequent traveler myself, I am concerned about my 
own safety, someone who gets on a plane twice a week, a mother 
of two young children, and flies away from her family to serve 
our country and then hopefully back home safe again. This is 
personal to so many lawmakers, as well, and we want you to know 
that we take this issue personally, and the safety of the 
workers who help us get to and from our destination safely, as 
well.
    I want to talk about what the impacts on staffing in 
particular will continue to look like if we face these delays, 
kick the can further and further down the road. Those have 
significant safety implications, as we have talked about here 
today and as we have seen firsthand.
    So, what will the impact on workforce recruitment and 
retention be? We know you may not be able to predict with exact 
certainty, but talk to me about how you see some of that 
playing out if the Senate continues to delay.
    Mr. Peterson. Yes. Well, certainly the Senate delaying this 
isn't helpful by any means, and we want to see that get done.
    One element on the maintenance side that I want to just 
speak to is, as a mechanic, the training during the COVID era, 
we couldn't train aircraft mechanics and that pipeline slowed 
down. So, we are seeing that come back up, now that people are 
able to get back into school and do the training. Again, it 
goes back to a lot of the schools aren't open anymore. Many of 
the college and even high school programs have just been shut 
down.
    We can't get workers into the field if we don't have enough 
training facilities to get them into the field. So, this 
legislation provides the ability to do that, and we are 
thankful for that. This isn't new, though.
    Ms. Scholten. Right.
    Mr. Peterson. This has been something that we have been 
arguing about for years, and it goes back several years, about 
training facilities and training at home and not moving these 
jobs abroad to where we don't know who is performing what type 
of work on these aircrafts.
    And again, the traveling public, yourself, your families 
deserve better.
    Ms. Scholten. That is exactly right. Thank you so much.
    I yield back the remainder.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you, Ms. Scholten. With that, I 
am going to recognize myself for 5 minutes, representing 
Oregon's Fifth Congressional District with Portland 
International Airport just outside of my district about 15 
minutes away, and many municipal airports in the Pacific 
Northwest that, again, are under threat if we do not pass this 
FAA reauthorization.
    So, again, good afternoon, and it is great that we are here 
today to discuss the continued push for FAA reauthorization, 
especially during the busiest time of year. And air travel and 
during the holidays is when people get most anxious about: Are 
they going to get somewhere on time?
    Reports this year were that Thanksgiving travel set 
records. This past Sunday alone, TSA reported that almost 3 
million travelers were screened. Luckily, there were no 
significant delays across the U.S. caused by weather or other 
means.
    Mr. Santa, you state in your testimony that staffing 
shortages of air traffic controllers can pose serious risks to 
not only flight delays and cancellations, but in-flight safety, 
as well. And due to mandatory overtime scheduling, fatigue can 
be at risk. As you suggest, more accurate operational staffing 
targets developed by the Collaborative Resource Workgroup must 
be included in FAA's annual controller workforce plan.
    Can you elaborate on what the CRWG has offered as 
solutions, and how they may address future delays, 
cancellations, or safety concerns, especially during holiday 
travel season?
    Mr. Santa. Thank you for the question. So, the CRWG numbers 
started with interviews of all of the 313 FAA facilities to see 
where they were at, see the needs and the desires of the 
collaborative groups locally. And the goal was to address 10-
year-old expired numbers. Flight schools opened and close, 
vacation destinations change, corporate traffic ebbs and flows, 
and commercial traffic changes hubs and destinations, as well. 
To have a model, a staffing model that is 10 years old doesn't 
serve the industry or the facilities well.
    So, the collaborative group that was jointly developed by 
the Air Traffic Organization at FAA and NATCA--and importantly, 
it was validated for transparency and repeatability by the 
MITRE Corporation--those numbers being implemented and used for 
the basis of the controller workforce plan will pay dividends 
for now and in the future to accurately reflect what we need at 
the facilities in the NAS.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you.
    Of course, there are other reasons for flight delays. As 
part of the House-passed FAA, I supported an amendment to 
require DOT to improve reporting requirements for commercial 
flight cancellations or delays, with the goal of keeping 
travelers more informed and leading to strategies to mitigate 
the causes of those delays. Mr. Bradbury, how might this 
amendment improve the traveling experience for passengers at 
airports?
    And further, do you believe airports have a duty to 
passengers when flights get delayed or canceled, and can you 
explain how airports are working towards helping to improve 
that experience?
    Mr. Bradbury. Absolutely. The experience--obviously, 
everything comes down to our passengers. We don't exist without 
passengers. And our ability to connect the passenger to the air 
transportation system is paramount. So, it is critical that we 
work together to make sure we mitigate issues and make it a 
seamless travel experience for all of our passengers, those 
with mobility improvements, mobility and other disabilities. 
And this bill helps us to keep that going.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Well, thank you. I think the theme is 
consistent.
    We will have one more at this point. Am I correct? Oh, we 
are going to have two more, good.
    But the theme is correct. We want to make sure that we get 
this passed. We are working bipartisan bicameral is what we are 
hoping, that the Senate will step up and get this done. Because 
I think without this, we are going to see a further 
delineation.
    And as a new legislator, I mean, this is something that we 
are counting on, and that we are working hard to do. So, thank 
you for being here today.
    And with that I will yield back the rest of my time and, 
Mr. DeSaulnier----
    Mr. DeSaulnier [interposing]. Nicely done.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer [continuing]. It is your turn for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. DeSaulnier. You must have taken French in high school.
    Well, I want to thank you, and I want to thank the 
committee for having this hearing.
    I have to say I look at so many familiar faces who I have 
worked with on my input on the reauthorization--I am going to 
date myself here--I feel like Charlie Brown with Lucy with the 
football, and Lucy would be the Senate. This was such a 
success, and there were some--there were things in it that I 
didn't like, and standing alone I would not have voted for, and 
they are trying to wrestle with those things. So, it is with a 
great deal of anticipation that I hope that we get this done.
    And in addition, having been involved so much with the Safe 
Landings Act, which--so much of it that was my bill that came 
out of the near-miss at SFO 10 years ago, that there is so much 
possibility, but there is also so much risk with the near-
misses and the pressure on the system.
    Mr. Santa, I was just up in SFO's tower again, your folks. 
Every time I land, I am afraid they are going to [gesturing] 
``Follow me.'' It was wonderful, as always. I would like to do 
more of them in other parts of the country. But what I wanted 
to talk to you about here, every time I go, every time I talk, 
is the illustration--and it is part of our challenge in getting 
it reauthorized--is: When does technology benefit?
    When is it interacted, which, in our Safe Landings Act, 
clearly those investments have made landings safer by upgrading 
the technology.
    And then the human factors of which I spent so much time 
with the pilots and with your folks, recognizing you need 
trained professionals.
    And also recognizing, as having been a long-time elected 
from the San Francisco Bay area, and proud of the tech 
industry, but also being very aware of the marketing in some of 
this technology is getting it right.
    So, when I was up in the tower, it was sort of interesting. 
There was an incident where the technology didn't work on one 
of the planes that ran a stoplight, a stop sign on a taxiway. 
It wasn't dangerous, but it was interesting just hearing the 
staff respond going, ``Whoa.'' So, getting this right, how do 
we evaluate the technology to make sure?
    And the other part is to make sure not just on the 
disparity in high-cost areas where so many members are, and I 
hear when I talk to them, that even with the differential, it 
is not enough to live in places like the bay area because the 
cost of housing, but then the continuous training.
    So, the vetting and the technology on the procurement side, 
making sure the people who actually have to use the technology, 
the pilots and your folks are part of that to make sure that 
there is real, true value in it, and they are not being seduced 
by the marketing of the technology, and then the continuous 
training that they have to get, and how we have provided for 
that for your members and for the FAA.
    Mr. Santa. Yes, the most important asset we have is our 
people, is our controllers. They are talented, they are 
professional. They take a lifetime of effort to learn their 
skills, and they use them every single day. Thousands of 
decisions, safety critical decisions are made every hour you 
are on position.
    The technology that we talk about subsidizes that. It helps 
that. It allows you more information to evaluate. It allows you 
quicker decisionmaking tools. And to be part of that, 
collaboratively to be part of that, to determine the direction 
of that is essential because, as I said, the essential nature 
of our controllers and our people needs to be evaluated by 
every piece of technology that comes.
    Luckily, we are involved in those workgroups. 
Unfortunately, the funding and the staffing really isn't there 
to fulfill them to finality or to completion.
    Mr. DeSaulnier. Mr. Bradbury, maybe your experience. I 
mean, we have got this pressure on the airports to move people 
through. I have talked to my friends in the industry about 
their profit margins, but technology, getting it right, so, as 
Mr. Santa said, it is a complement to the humans being 
professionally trained.
    Mr. Bradbury. Absolutely. Technology is critical to what we 
do every day. And we are seeing those impacts.
    Having FAA reauthorization gives us more flexibility around 
terminal funding, as well. And huge--we are looking at 
replacing passenger boarding bridges, three, four, five, six, 
seven at our terminal just to really improve that experience 
and make sure we have all the technology and all of the 
equipment in place to respond to our passenger needs.
    Mr. DeSaulnier. Yes. And just the last thing about SFO. 
Years ago, there was a controversial proposal, because of the 
volume, to add another runway in the bay, and it was stopped. 
But the promise was, technology would keep it as safe and keep 
the volumes as high. And now, anecdotally, I hear that that is 
a challenge.
    So, I appreciate it. Thank you, and I yield back.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you. I will now recognize Ms. 
Wilson from Florida for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you for this necessary hearing 
today.
    As we work towards the Federal Aviation Administration 
authorization, we must maintain our global leadership in 
aviation. To do this, we must consider timely airport 
infrastructure upgrades and a commitment to bolstering our 
security.
    In my district, the Miami International Airport is one of 
the most active airports for international passengers, with 
more flights to Latin America and the Caribbean than any other 
U.S. airport. However, the lack of a Federal Aviation 
Administration bill has increased security concerns, as seen in 
a distressing incident this Monday in Miami International 
Airport. A passenger on an American Airlines flight assaulted 
multiple airline workers, sending one to the hospital with 
permanent injuries. This is utterly unacceptable.
    Our aviation workforce must remain safe and protected from 
dangerous passengers. Unfortunately, the delayed 
reauthorization leaves newly confirmed FAA Administrator 
Whitaker without necessary congressional guidance. He needs 
clear direction on Congress' FAA priorities to move the FAA 
forward. Without such direction, we risk the future of the 
aviation industry and jobs. Jobs, jobs, jobs has always been my 
mantra, and the lack of congressional direction will continue 
to affect the aviation workforce negatively.
    An FAA reauthorization bill is not just a piece of 
legislation. It symbolizes a commitment, the safety of every 
traveler, a pledge to foster economic development, and an 
investment in the technological advancement that will propel 
aviation into the future. With that I have a few questions for 
the witnesses.
    Mr. Peterson, in section 538 of the FAA reauthorization 
bill, the bill creates a task force to address issues with the 
interference of aviation workforce members. Can you talk about 
the importance of this task force, and can you highlight the 
labor representative's critical role in this task force?
    Mr. Peterson. Yes, thank you. So, first and foremost, I am 
aware of the situation in Miami. And that is exactly why this 
is needed.
    The folks that work in aviation, we are just trying to do 
our job, get passengers from point A to point B. When something 
doesn't go right with a passenger service agent or a flight 
attendant, it seems that now passengers feel they can abuse 
them and get physically violent.
    The task force that could be put in place, one, is to 
figure out how to lower that temperature when those situations 
happen. And then the second piece is, we have got to find a 
way, when this does happen, that people are convicted of the 
right crime. And again, there is jurisdictional issues that 
come up not necessarily inside the airport, but certainly on 
the aircraft with the flight attendants that we deal with.
    But the task force between labor and, so to speak, 
management working together to figure out how to eliminate 
those types of situations as best as possible is critical. This 
bill provides for that, and it has been a long time coming. As 
we have seen in the past couple of years, these numbers just 
keep escalating. There has got to be a way to bring them down.
    Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you. Mr. Peterson, the number 
of unruly passengers in 2023 drastically outpaced the numbers 
pre-COVID. This trend has been a growing problem throughout the 
Nation. Locally, we have seen numerous incidents at the Fort 
Lauderdale airport. Can you talk about the importance of 
protecting the workers in the airport, be it gate agents, TSA 
employees, everyone?
    Mr. Peterson. Yes, and I think it goes hand in hand, in-
flight or on the ground. The incident at Fort Lauderdale 
involved one of our agents, a Spirit agent, just recently. 
Again, I am very familiar with the situation.
    There is this belief, again, that if you are not getting 
what you want in an airport from an agent, you can abuse them. 
And it is just simply--there has got to be an agreement somehow 
between labor and management that passengers who do this, one, 
aren't allowed to fly for at least some period of time. And the 
problem we have today is none of that data can be shared, so, 
they just go from one airline to another if an airline does ban 
somebody. This isn't good for the airport infrastructure, Fort 
Lauderdale being a great example. This has been an ongoing 
issue in Fort Lauderdale multiple times with people.
    And so, we have got to find a way to put penalties in place 
for people that are bad actors in the airport or on the 
aircraft, and protect the workers in both those areas.
    Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you.
    I yield back.
    Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer. The gentlelady yields back, thank you.
    Are there any further questions from members of the 
committee who have not been recognized?
    Seeing none, that concludes our hearing today. I want to 
thank each and every witness that was here today for your time 
and your testimony.
    And with that, this committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 1:05 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]



                    [all]
