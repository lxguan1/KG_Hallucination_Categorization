  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,
       Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer 
                                                Protection,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Subcommittee met at 9:30 a.m., in room SD-538, Dirksen 
Senate Office Building, Hon. Raphael G. Warnock, Chair of the 
Subcommittee, presiding.

         OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIR RAPHAEL G. WARNOCK

    Chair Warnock. Good morning. This Subcommittee will come to 
order. Welcome to the first hearing of the Subcommittee on 
Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection this Congress.
    This hearing is in a hybrid format, but our Members and our 
witnesses will be here in person today. We are grateful for 
their presence and their willingness to participate.
    And I am honored, deeply, to the Subcommittee again this 
session and to continue to work with Ranking Member Tillis to 
make life more affordable by lowering costs for consumers all 
across our country, and to ensure stability in our financial 
institutions that serve families, that serve our small 
businesses, and communities in Georgia and around the country.
    I am proud of our efforts to ensure that communities have 
equal access to financial resources so we can build an economy 
that works for all Americans. I think that is in our 
collective, enlightened self-interest.
    Today's hearing is about protecting Americans from junk 
fees in financial services, and it will examine the exploitive 
fee practices that fall under the jurisdiction of this 
Committee. This includes unnecessary and onerous fees on bank 
deposit accounts, a topic I have examined before, as well as 
student loans, and also in the rental housing market, and also 
small-dollar lending.
    We understand that many fees do indeed fund critical 
services and products, and so I want to say that at the outset. 
Not all fees are the same. Some fees are excessively high, some 
fees are unclear, and some fees exist solely so that large 
corporations can pad their bottom lines on the backs of 
hardworking families. These fees provide no economic value. 
They are a drag on the American economy, and business school 
economists call this, quote, ``rent seeking.''
    But today I will say that what we all know they actually 
are--they are junk fees. And these junk fees are keeping 
hardworking Americans out of our financial system, particularly 
those who are already living on the edge of the economy. For 
example, one-third of unbanked households cite high fees as the 
reason that they remain without a bank account. And we know 
these types of fees affect poor people and people of color at a 
disproportionate rate.
    Since this Subcommittee began our examination on fees, the 
good news is that some banks have now voluntarily made these 
changes permanent, and I applaud Zillow, apartments.com, and 
affordablehousing.com for committing to transparency in their 
rental listings, and more of their peers should follow suit and 
do the same.
    Let me say that this is not theoretical stuff for me. I 
have heard from Georgians about the harms of these fees. I have 
talked to the owners of small businesses, parents who have seen 
their children targeted while on a college campus. And in the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's request for feedback on 
fees, one Georgian serving in the military wrote about how 
technical glitches and shady business practices by their large 
bank cost them money and stress while they were preparing to 
deploy to a war zone.
    Protecting our servicemembers is something that both the 
Ranking Member and I are serious about, and I am glad that 
today, on the Senate floor, we will be voting on my amendment 
to the NDAA to help prevent the harassment of members of the 
military by shady debt collectors. And I am grateful for the 
Ranking Member's cosponsorship of this bipartisan amendment and 
support bringing that into law. Our men and women in uniform 
should be focusing on their missions and caring for their 
families. They should not be nickeled and dimed by unscrupulous 
corporations, and debt collectors certainly should not be able 
to weaponize their services in pursuit of this practice.
    This is also personal for me. In addition to serving as the 
Senator for Georgia I still serve as senior pastor of the 
historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. And my church 
counts among its members Georgians from every walk of life, and 
we look out for each other. As a pastor and as a Senator, I 
seem work as grounded in serving others and my community, and I 
want to extend this call to all of our Nation's financial 
institutions to do the same. Love your neighbors, yourself.
    These fees do not just directly hurt families. Small 
businesses, which form the backbone of our economy also face 
the brunt of predatory fees. The burden of excessive fees eats 
into their profit margins, reducing their ability to invest in 
expansion, to hire more workers, and to compete. By hampering 
small businesses' growth, these fees impede job creation and 
limit economic opportunity. As I often say, I think this is one 
more example where the right thing to do is also the smart 
thing to do. It is good not only for these individual 
consumers, it is the right thing to do for our economy. It in 
our enlightened, collective self-interest.
    I believe Congress, and this Subcommittee in particular, 
have an important role to play in ensuring that the financial 
institutions that support our communities, our small 
businesses, and working families have the resources, the tools, 
and the support to continue their important work. At the same 
time, this is about our values. We must hold these businesses 
accountable when they juice their profits off the backs of 
hardworking Americans and ensure that they are not looking at 
these customers as easy targets to be taken advantage of with 
onerous and opaque fees.
    As a long-time student of Dr. King, this makes me think of 
words he wrote in his very last book, 1967, Where Do We Go from 
Here: Chaos or Community? Dr. King said that the profit motive, 
when it is the sole basis of an economic system, encourages a 
cutthroat competition and selfish ambition that inspire men to 
be more I-centered than thou-centered.
    And so I am focused on growing the middle class by lowering 
costs for Georgians and saving them money, and like all of my 
hearings, this hearing is about helping people, helping 
ordinary people, helping communities, helping small businesses 
to thrive by making life more affordable and creating jobs in 
the process. As American families, small businesses, and 
communities recover, we must ensure that they have the 
resources they need, not only to survive but to thrive.
    Thank you, and with that I will now turn to Ranking Member 
Tillis for his opening statement.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR THOM TILLIS

    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Chairman Warnock, for holding 
this hearing, and thanks to the witnesses for being here to 
testify.
    Any careful study of Federal statute or regulations will be 
hard-pressed to find a formal definition for the term ``junk 
fees.'' It is quite simply because it does not exist. Though 
policymakers and regulators should certainly act against 
dishonest and abusive charges and practices, it is undeniable 
that the term ``junk fees'' is political in origin. So too, 
unfortunately, are the many regulatory actions that are 
underway on the issue.
    President Biden first announced his Administration's 
initiative to combat so-called junk fees last October. This 
announcement, which broadly coincided with the looming election 
and levels of inflation not seen in 40 years was widely branded 
as the Administration's primary solution to the economic pain 
being felt by Americans. It is interesting that these fees, 
most of which had long been present in the economy, were 
suddenly identified as the drivers of surging inflation, though 
the nearly $2 trillion President Biden opted to pump in the 
U.S. economy was somehow not.
    In announcing his initiative, President Biden directed 
Federal agencies to ``reduce or eliminate hidden fees, charges, 
and add-ons for everything from banking services to cable and 
internet bills to airline and concert tickets,'' end quote. As 
the President's own words suggest, the scope of this initiative 
is exceedingly wide and vaguely defined, thus giving individual 
Federal regulators tremendous latitude to act under the banner 
of junk fees.
    Chief among these regulators is the CFPB, an agency with a 
well-established reputation for pushing against its regulatory 
and jurisdictional boundaries. Similar to much of the CFPB's 
work over the years, several concerning themes have emerged in 
their efforts on so-called junk fees. First, the CFPB, at 
times, has offered various definitions as to what constitutes a 
junk fee in their eyes, muddying the waters for honest, good-
faith actors who are simply trying to comply with the CFPB's 
public stances.
    Second, the CFPB has resorted to one of its favorite 
tricks--engaging in naming and shaming campaigns. In actions 
taken on overdraft and insufficient funds policy, the CFPB 
publicized a list of institutions that were all, by any 
reasonable measure, clearly abiding by the law but not the 
policy preferences of the CFPB. Unfortunately, these coercion-
style tactics were only encouraged by the Biden administration.
    Third, the CFPB continues to maneuver its policy actions to 
skirt around the Administrative Procedures Act, which is 
clearly designed by Congress to bring accountability and 
oversight to the rulemaking process. Through its reliance on 
blog posts, press releases, guidance, and statements of policy, 
the CFPB often mislabels its actions to avoid the rigors of the 
APA and minimize the likelihood of judicial review.
    Finally, as with much of their work there is little to no 
evidence of the CFPB collaborating with other regulators or 
consulting them on implications of their policy changes. The 
wholesale changes of overdraft and NSF pushed by the CFPB 
certainly have significant implications for prudential 
regulation. Yet it is unclear if the CFPB sought feedback from 
the Federal Reserve or others. If not, this represents a 
serious instance of irresponsible regulation for political 
outcomes, not actions that promote safety and soundness in the 
U.S. banking system.
    For these reasons and others, many have concerns with the 
efforts led by the CFPB, and the Biden administration as a 
whole, on so-called junk fees. Reasonable people can disagree 
on policy. In Congress, we frequently do. But no one should 
find practices common at the CFPB acceptable.
    I look forward to the questions and I look forward to your 
testimony. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chair Warnock. Thank you so very much, Ranking Member 
Tillis, for your opening statement, and we turn now to our 
witnesses testifying today, will the Honorable Michelle Henry, 
Attorney General for the great State of Pennsylvania. Also 
testifying is Ms. Lindsey Siegel, who is the Director of 
Housing Advocacy for the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. And 
finally, our third witness is Mr. Brian Johnson, who is the 
Managing Director at Patomak Global Partners.
    We appreciate your testimony, and I look forward to this 
discussion about this important issue.
    Attorney General Henry, I will now turn things over to you.

STATEMENT OF MICHELLE A. HENRY, ATTORNEY GENERAL, COMMONWEALTH 
                        OF PENNSYLVANIA

    Ms. Henry. Well, thank you. Good morning, Chairman Warnock, 
Ranking Member Tillis, and Members of the Committee. Thank you 
for inviting me to testify today. My name is Michelle Henry, 
and I am the Attorney General of Pennsylvania. I first joined 
the office in January of 2017, as a First Deputy Attorney 
General.
    I will begin by saying this Committee is right to focus its 
attention on junk fees because they harm both businesses and 
consumers. Honest businesses lose out to competitors who charge 
junk fees because the competitors' prices appear at first to be 
a better deal. Junk fees also prevent consumers from 
effectively shopping for the best overall price.
    In Pennsylvania, we have been working to protect consumers 
against junk fees. In the consumer finance space we recently 
filed a multistate lawsuit against Mariner Finance, a Wall 
Street private equity-owned installment lender. Our lawsuit 
alleges that Mariner charged consumers junk fees for hidden, 
add-on products that consumers either did not know about or did 
not agree to buy. These hidden, add-on product, such as credit 
insurance and auto clubs, are typically low- or no-value 
products.
    Consumers left Mariner believing that they had entered into 
an agreement to borrow and repay, over time, a certain amount 
of money. In reality, because of these hidden junk fees, 
Mariner added hundreds to thousands of dollars to the total 
amount a consumer owed.
    The cost of the junk fees is staggering. For a random 
sample of loans originated in Pennsylvania in December of 2020, 
Mariner charged each consumer an average of $1,085 in junk 
fees, for an average of $3,394 in cash borrowed.
    We also had a significant junk fee settlement in 2018 with 
Wells Fargo. This settlement stemmed from Wells charging its 
auto finance customers millions in junk fees. Despite evidence 
that many customers already had the required car insurance, 
Wells improperly charged more than 2 million accounts for 
force-placed insurance. To resolve the multistate action, Wells 
agreed to pay States $575 million.
    And although Mariner and other predatory lenders often 
argue that their overpriced loans are necessary to help 
consumers make ends meet in a moment of dire need, such as an 
unexpected car repair, we have found, from empirical research 
that far more predatory loans are taken out to meet reoccurring 
expenses than for emergencies.
    Consumers in Pennsylvania often tell our office that they 
regret taking out their loans from a high-cost lender. Many 
times they tell us that the lender pushed them to borrow more 
than they wanted or needed, and often they were led to the 
lender by online lead generators that purport to be helping the 
consumer find the best deal available. In reality, most 
consumers would have been better off getting an auto refinance 
loan or an installment loan at their local credit union or 
community bank rather than going to an expensive installment 
lender that charges junk fees.
    We have also worked hard to stop hotel companies and 
concert promoters from charging junk fees. In 2020, we 
announced a settlement with a ticket seller that had been 
charging fees the consumer never agreed to, and it also refused 
to honor a refund policy. As part of that settlement, the 
company agreed to provide full refunds for all Pennsylvania 
consumers for events that were canceled.
    In 2021, we announced the landmark junk fee settlement with 
Marriott International. For many years, travelers had been 
misled by the published rates offered by hotels for a night's 
stay, only later to be hit with the mandatory resort fees when 
they were checking in.
    Thanks to our settlement, Marriott now has a policy in 
place to be upfront and transparent in the disclosure of 
mandatory fees, including resort fees, as part of the total 
price of a hotel stay, allowing consumers to compare total 
costs for hotels and find the one that is the best fit for 
them. Marriott was the first hotel chain to formally commit to 
the upfront disclosure of resort fees as part of the initial 
advertised price. We hope others will follow.
    Of course, our fight against junk fees is one we cannot do 
on our own. We are working closely with our fellow States as 
well as our Federal law enforcement partners, like the CFPB, 
and I look forward to continuing to work with our partners.
    In the end, what we are fighting here for is basic fairness 
and transparency. When consumers are shopping online or in 
person, they deserve to understand what a loan, a house, or a 
vacation will cost, and exactly what key terms they are 
agreeing to. At the same time, all businesses deserve to 
compete on an even playing field, where the price is the price 
with no hidden surprise fees.
    Thank you for inviting me to testify today, and I look 
forward to your questions.
    Chair Warnock. Thank you very much, Attorney General Henry, 
for your testimony and for your work on this issue.
    Next we will hear from Ms. Siegel.

  STATEMENT OF LINDSEY SIEGEL, DIRECTOR OF HOUSING ADVOCACY, 
                   ATLANTA LEGAL AID SOCIETY

    Ms. Siegel. Good morning, Chairman Warnock, Ranking Member 
Tillis, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for the 
opportunity to testify on behalf of the low-income clients of 
the Atlanta Legal Aid Society, and thank you to Senator Warnock 
for your leadership and long history of fighting for low-income 
families not just in Georgia but throughout the country.
    My name is Lindsey Siegel, and I am the Director of Housing 
Advocacy at Atlanta Legal Aid, which provides free civil legal 
services to families with low incomes in the metro Atlanta 
area. Today I will focus on the rental housing market and how 
predatory and hidden rental fees gouge families living in 
poverty and make their rent even more unaffordable than it 
already is.
    Ms. Dixon is a single mother who found an online listing 
for an apartment in the fall of 2020. The advertisement said it 
rented for $1,400 per month. It did not list any other monthly 
fees she would be required to pay. She applied and paid $525 
through the landlord's online portal which covered her $50 
application fees, a $175 move-in fee, and a $300 screening fee, 
all of which were nonrefundable. She was not able to see the 
lease or the apartment she would be renting, but she knew if 
she did not pay sight unseen she would lose the apartment.
    And when her application was approved a few weeks later, 
the landlord charged her another $200 approval fee.
    She finally received and signed a copy of her lease just 2 
days before she was slated to move in. It was 50 pages long and 
contained eight different addenda. She had expected to pay her 
rent and for water. She did not expect to be responsible for a 
package locker fee, a trash removal fee, a separate valet trash 
fee, a pest control fee, a technology package fee, an insurance 
fee, and a credit reporting fee. When the fees added up, $83 
had been tacked onto her monthly rent. And to make matters 
worse, Ms. Dixon's landlord did not accept the rent by cash, 
check, or money order. When she paid through the landlord's 
online portal she was charged another $72 per-payment 
convenience fee.
    The low-income renters Atlanta Legal Aid represents have an 
extreme power imbalance with their landlords. The high demand 
for rental housing, especially at the more affordable end of 
the market, makes some landlords believe they can easily get 
away with unfair and deceptive lease terms and rental 
practices. The bait-and-switch Ms. Dixon experienced, where the 
landlord advertised the rent as one price only to raise it much 
higher with junk fees after she had spent hundreds of dollars 
up front, is a far-too-common practice of many investor 
landlords in the Atlanta area.
    Low-income renters like Ms. Dixon become trapped. She could 
not afford to walk away from a predatory lease 2 days before 
she was supposed to move in, even if she realized it would be 
unaffordable.
    Of particular concern is the use of high application fees. 
They often far exceed the cost of running a report, and most 
renters have to pay them several times before finding a home to 
rent. We have heard reports that some institutional landlords 
even collect application fees after they have found a renter 
for an available home.
    The renters of color Atlanta Legal Aid serves are 
particularly harmed. Researchers believe the high application 
fees likely steer renters of color toward lower-quality housing 
in lower-opportunity areas, driving residential segregation. In 
Atlanta, renters who used to live in in-town neighborhoods have 
been pushed further outside the city, to areas where schools 
are lower performing, transportation is more challenging, 
housing is lower quality, and jobs are harder to find.
    Although junk rental fees affect all aspects of the rental 
market, they place a disproportionate burden on the livelihoods 
of low-income families. Atlanta Legal Aid's low-income clients 
understand the risk of not paying rent, and the vast majority 
will avoid it at all costs. They will forego food, medicine, 
clothing, and doctor visits. They will get a second job. They 
will apply for public benefits like food stamps. They will do 
whatever they can to avoid becoming homeless.
    The proliferation of these abusive fees and how common they 
are, particularly with investor landlords, demonstrates the 
need for specific protection for tenants. Stronger Federal 
regulation could help define what is excessive and give States, 
advocates, and renters new tools to combat these fees.
    We are pleased the White House and this Subcommittee are 
concerned about fairness and transparency in the rental market, 
and I appreciate the opportunity to share our clients' 
experiences with you today. I look forward to answering any 
questions you have.
    Chair Warnock. Thank you very much, Ms. Siegel.
    Next, Mr. Johnson.

 STATEMENT OF BRIAN JOHNSON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, PATOMAK GLOBAL 
                            PARTNERS

    Mr. Johnson. Chairman Warnock, Ranking Member Tillis, and 
Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to 
testify about financial institutions' fees and the appropriate 
Federal regulatory response. My name is Brian Johnson. I am 
Managing Director of Patomak Global Partners, where I advise on 
financial regulatory compliance matters. I previously served as 
the Deputy Director of the CFPB, and prior to that I served on 
the staff of the House Committee on Financial Services.
    Today's hearing is timely. The American people have 
suffered from abnormally high inflation for 2 years, which has 
decimated the value of their savings. Because of this 
inflation, a dollar today buys only about 86 percent of what it 
did in just 2021, which represents an erosion of over $9,900 in 
median household purchasing power. Indeed, without the burden 
that inflation has inflicted on the American family, it is 
unlikely we would be here today talking about the fees.
    The Administration's decision to launch an initiative to 
combat so-called junk fees is an unfortunate missed opportunity 
to address the root causes of inflation. To date, the focus on 
the President's initiative has been on applying political 
pressure to companies to induce them to change their fee 
disclosure practices. In the process, the White House and 
supporting agencies have dismissed broad categories of fees as 
junk without ever providing any consistent definition of the 
term, which has created uncertainty as to which fees can be 
assessed by institutions without undue reputational or 
regulatory risk.
    The CFPB has been the most enthusiastic among regulators in 
heeding the President's call, indiscriminately attacking a 
growing list of common financial services fees, no matter that 
they are lawful and fully disclosed. While the President's 
agenda is more far-reaching than the CFPB, my testimony focuses 
on the bureau's activity, based on my experience there.
    The primary metric by which to judge the CFPB's actions 
should be whether the agency has adhered to the rule of law. By 
this objective measure, the CFPB's actions are deeply 
concerning. While my written testimony goes into greater detail 
regarding the CFPB's transgressions, let me summarize them 
here.
    The agency has publicly hectored companies about deposit 
account fees and used the implied threat of investigation to 
induce such companies to abandon these legal fees. Further, in 
addressing other fees, the CFPB appears to have violated its 
own regulations and laws governing how agencies proffer rules 
by disguising interpretative rules as policy statements in 
bulletins and issuing circulars that function as legislative 
rules.
    In another instance, under the guise of interpretation, the 
CFPB read a word into a statute to achieve its desired policy 
outcome. In still another, the agency treats the rulemaking 
process as a foregone conclusion, acting as though a still-
proposed rule has already taken effect, signaling that the 
agency has no interest in considering public comments, 
establishing an adequate evidentiary basis to supports its 
conclusions, or considering potential changes to improve the 
rule.
    These examples demonstrate an abuse of power and the 
agency's disregard for process and the limits placed on it. 
Moreover, the CFPB's behavior subverts the authority of 
Congress to oversee the agency and legislate the legality of 
fees in our financial marketplace. Simply put, it is not 
playing by the rules.
    Some may defend the agency by saying the ends justify the 
means, but the CFPB itself acknowledges that these efforts harm 
more people than they help. For example, the CFPB claims, in 
its proposed credit card late fees rule, that it will reduce 
late fees by $9 billion per year. But the harsh reality is 
there is no free lunch, and this reduction will not achieve a 
net savings for consumers but rather a cost transfer from the 
relatively few late payers to the great majority of consumers 
who always pay their credit card bills on time.
    I applaud the Subcommittee for exercising its authority to 
explore the Administration's efforts to reduce or eliminate 
what some label as ``junk fees.'' I urge Congress to look more 
closely at the expected costs and benefits of these efforts, 
both for the intended beneficiaries and for all the other 
affected consumers who are too often dismissed as an 
afterthought. Congress should pay special attention when the 
means used to achieve an agency's ends run afoul of the rules 
and laws that make the system fair for everyone. Most of all, I 
applaud the Subcommittee's effort to shine a light on the 
burden shouldered by consumers under the weight of 
extraordinary inflation.
    Thank you again for the chance to discuss this important 
issue, and I welcome the opportunity to answer your questions.
    Chair Warnock. I thank all of you for your testimony, and 
we will begin with questions now. I am going to defer to my 
colleague, Senator Cortez Masto, who is double-booked, to offer 
her questions.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to the 
Ranking Member. Thank you so much for having this Subcommittee 
hearing. Thank you to the panelists.
    This is such an important issue I hear all the time from 
Nevadans, and let me just start this because I do think there 
is a problem with surprise fees and junk fees. It is not 
inflation related. It is not because of what the CFPB is doing 
out there. There is an issue, and I hear it from my 
constituents in Nevada all the time.
    Let me give you an example. Since May of 2020, there are 
123,000 eviction filings in southern Nevada. Nearly 60,000 
evictions were filed this past year. That is a 160 percent 
increase since before the pandemic. Just last month, southern 
Nevada had nearly 5,000 eviction filings.
    Now I know that it is not just the high rental costs and 
housing costs, but there were extra surprise fees that I heard 
from these families that were having an impact on them as well. 
Let me just give you an example. I had heard from families that 
some of these companies were charging multiple family 
application fees for one apartment, even when landlords knew 
that the apartment had already been rented. They were charging 
applicants for credit reports that the property manager did not 
even end up purchasing or had no intention of purchasing. They 
were charging an application fee for minors living with a 
prospective tenant.
    Ms. Siegel, we heard from you. On and on and on, this is an 
issue that is happening. These are junk fees. These are junk 
fees. And let me just say, over the course of my experience in 
housing, when I purchased apartments, I did not deal with these 
fees, and I would question these fees. And who should not 
question these fees? And I am so appreciative that General 
Henry, you are here, and the AGs are looking at this as well.
    I guess my question to maybe General Henry and Ms. Siegel 
is what can be done. Whose action is it to really address this? 
Is it at a Federal level, or do we leave it to the States to 
look at addressing this as well?
    And maybe, General Henry, I will start with you.
    Ms. Henry. Thank you and thank you for your concern. I 
concur with that, and I would see this. I think it is both. In 
terms of what Pennsylvania has seen and working with other 
States, we join with our Federal partners in really holding 
these individuals accountable, that take advantage of 
consumers, that lack transparency. And we have seen it in all 
different areas. You mention the landlord tenant. We also have 
looked into that matter, and it is often first-time renters.
    At Penn State University, we had a case where similar 
conduct was happening, where landlords were charging tenants, 
on top of their regular rent, administrative fees and other 
fees that were illegal in Pennsylvania.
    So I think it is important that the States remain vigilant 
as well as looking at the regulations that we can apply with 
our Federal partners. Thank you.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    Ms. Siegal. Thank you, Senator. I think the White House 
press release from last week is a good first step, and the 
commitment that the Administration got from Zillow and others 
to be more transparent I think will help tenants understand 
what the fees are going to be and what they can afford. And it 
will likely lead to lower eviction rates because people will 
not get trapped in leases that are unaffordable for them, like 
Ms. Dixon did.
    But I think disclosure alone is not enough to protect 
people. Even if fees are disclosed, what we are seeing in 
Atlanta is they are often buried in the lease or they 
contradict what tenants are hearing verbally from the property 
manager.
    So I think the Federal Government does have a role to play. 
The CFPB could create best practices, investigate junk fees 
further, especially those being charged for tenant screening 
reports, could bring enforcement actions against debt 
collectors that engage in collection practices that violate the 
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act in their collection of 
rental debt, especially includes collection of junk fees. And 
certainly, you know, HUD could further study and address the 
disproportionate impact of these practices on renters and 
rental applicants of color.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. And Ms. Siegel, I think 
you mentioned this in your testimony. You assert that very 
large institutional property management companies are the main 
culprits of using junk and hidden fees to help drive profits. 
Can you talk a little bit more about that and that assessment, 
because I see, in southern Nevada, listen, we have large 
institutional properties coming in, equity companies coming in 
and purchasing up all these rental properties.
    So what data do you have that supports that statement?
    Ms. Siegal. You know, I represent individual tenants so I 
cannot speak as much to the data as I can to my clients' 
experiences. But I can tell you that tenants living in Atlanta 
have a very hard time finding a rental, finding a home that is 
not owned by a corporate landlord at this point. They have 
bought up many properties in the Atlanta area, and they always 
seem to be working in lockstep so that one institutional 
landlord is charging a certain kind of fee, then another one 
tends to charge it as well.
    Just one example of this is the proliferation of landlords 
charging for insurance fees, and often tenants will think that 
these are renter's insurance because they are often called 
renter's insurance. But it is not like traditional renter's 
insurance that protects the renter and their property if it is 
destroyed. What it does is protect the landlord and does not 
really provide a benefit to tenants at all. And we have seen 
that proliferate with investor landlords, in particular.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Warnock. Thank you very much, Senator Cortez Masto. 
Ranking Member Tillis.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    General Henry, I think you made a great point on 
transparency. Part of what we have to do is, we can have a 
different discussion about fees and whatever you want to call 
them, but I think it is fair to say, I cannot imagine any 
reasonable Member of Congress not saying, ``I want the person 
to know what their financial obligation is when they sign an 
instrument, not after they read page 10 and the fine print.'' 
So I stipulate that. I want to work on that, and we have 
similar issues in health care and a number of other areas where 
we need transparency.
    And Ms. Siegel, your point on the rent, I am less caught up 
in whether or not a trash collection fee is appropriate or not. 
I am more caught up in does that renter know at the point in 
time they are signing a lease what they are expected to pay 
every month. It is another example of transparency. We can 
discuss the fees. I mean, if one fee goes away the rent could 
go up. We know that at the end of the day they are going to try 
and collect enough to manage their risk and pay their own 
bills, the landlords. So I agree with that. I think that 
practice is wrong.
    But I am still concerned, and we have had several 
references in the opening statements, about the CFPB could do 
this or could do that. But I personally think they have a 
scattershot, an ill-defined regulatory approach right now.
    Mr. Johnson, can you talk about the effect of the method 
that the CFPB is using to go after this and the negative 
implications it has?
    Mr. Johnson. Well, thank you, Senator. I mean, the use of 
the phrase ``scattershot'' I think is apt with respect to the 
approach that the CFPB us using. To have any chance of success 
in a regulation, from my experience at the agency, you have to 
carefully identify a market failure, you have to come up with a 
proposal that is narrowly tailored to address the root causes 
of that market failure, and you have to undergo careful cost-
benefit analysis to determine whether or not your solution is 
going to be worse than the problem to begin with. So there are 
many unintended consequences that come when agencies cut 
corners, and a scattershot approach will have those unintended 
consequences.
    Senator Tillis. One unintended consequence could be 
reducing underbanking or unbanking certain people because you 
have reached a point to where it is no longer fiscally viable 
for a product or service to be offered to a certain segment of 
the population. Is that one?
    Mr. Johnson. Absolutely. There is a longstanding tradeoff 
between price and access.
    Senator Tillis. Is the CFPB a prudential regulator?
    Mr. Johnson. It has no safety and soundness mission. It is 
market conduct regulator like the SEC or FTC, who are 
appropriated by Congress.
    Senator Tillis. If you take a look at the CFPB's efforts on 
overdraft fees as an example, after the 2008 financial crisis 
some regulators under the Obama administration emphasized 
reliability and countercyclical nature of overdraft revenue as 
an appropriate tool for ensuring the stability of the bank's 
balance sheets.
    Some of the Federal Reserve went so far as to express a 
desire to see overdraft revenue when grading banks on well-
known CAMELS rating system. And now the CFPB has undertaken a 
name-and-shame campaign to coerce banks who were following the 
established prudential standards for the crime of listening to 
their previous Federal regulators.
    So does the CFPB have the proper jurisdiction, resources, 
or staff to make prudential regulatory decisions?
    Mr. Johnson. No.
    Senator Tillis. Is the CFPB's tendency to name-and-shame 
business institutions to avoid certain practices or adopt new 
ones effective regulation?
    Mr. Johnson. It is not, and I would add that this tactic of 
using the implied threat of investigation to coerce lawful 
businesses to change their practices for political purposes 
should be condemned.
    Senator Tillis. Do you believe the bureau thinks these 
implications or conducts sufficient analysis on the follow-on 
effects of their junk fee regulations? You more or less 
answered that in a prior question. They are not really thinking 
through the full impact and all the potential unintended 
consequences. Can you think of any example under this current 
leadership of the CFPB where they have taken that into 
consideration?
    Mr. Johnson. Well, I mean, they are moving forward, at 
least, with a rulemaking on credit card late fees, but the 
problem with that rulemaking is the bureau admits that it lacks 
the evidence to understand the effect that the regulation will 
have on small card issuers, and rather than going to get that 
evidence, through, for instance, the SBREFA panel, it simply 
declined to do so.
    Senator Tillis. I thank you all for your testimony. Mr. 
Chair, I would like to submit for the record a letter from the 
Consumer Bankers Association on the subject.
    Chair Warnock. Without objection.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you.
    Chair Warnock. So I would like to go back to something that 
Attorney General Henry was talking about earlier. You talked 
about the case in Pennsylvania where a finance company 
allegedly engaged in egregious tactics to impose hundreds of 
dollars in hidden financial products for consumers. You talked 
about how that company would mail checks to folks who were 
struggling, and then when consumers cashed them they 
automatically opened a loan and discovered that they were 
playing these add-on insurance products over and over again.
    You have been vigilant going after these bad actors in that 
space, and in this case against Mariner, Pennsylvania partnered 
with several other States, and you have said in your testimony 
and in your answer that you think there is a role for States to 
play as well as the Federal Government.
    Let me ask you directly. How often do these kinds of cases 
cross State lines, and would having Federal standards against 
these types of hidden fees make these cases easier to bring?
    Ms. Henry. Almost always, and I think that is critical. I 
mean, where we have been most successful is joining with our 
fellow States, other attorneys general, and partnering with 
them, and including the CFPB. In December of 2020, the CFPB, 
with all 50 States and the District of Columbia, filed an 
enforcement action, for instance, against Nationstar Mortgage, 
again for deceptive practices, for not being transparent when 
they were servicing borrowers' mortgages. And as a result of 
that joint effort we were able to obtain a settlement of $73 
million and brought aid to 40,000 borrowers.
    So typically, in the practice of what we do at the Attorney 
General's Office, is we often see things bleed over State lines 
and boundaries, as you are well aware. So it is important that 
we work together to enforce these matters.
    Chair Warnock. Do you think consumers know what junk fees 
are?
    Ms. Henry. I think consumers are hit with them, and they 
often do not understand or see. And as you raised, the reality 
is a lot of times consumers get misled. So they are looking on 
the internet. They are trying to do due diligence and look for 
the best price, whether it is for a hotel, a vacation. And they 
are examining it and they get led to a certain area or a 
certain website thinking that is the best price, and they go 
down this rabbit hole where they have no idea, at the end of 
it, that the price they thought they were going to pay for a 
hotel stay with their family is actually far larger because of 
fees that they were not prepared or were not properly advised 
of. And at that point they are so far in, or they never 
discover it.
    So no, I do not think they understand exactly what to be 
aware of. We are trying to do our best to educate, but far more 
work needs to be done, and I applaud this Committee for working 
on it.
    Chair Warnock. If more Federal agencies have the authority 
to address these hidden fees, how would that affect your 
office's capacity?
    Ms. Henry. It would help tremendously.
    Chair Warnock. Thank you so very much.
    Yes, Senator Smith.
    Senator Smith. Great. Thank you so much, Chair Warnock and 
Ranking Member. I really appreciate you holding this hearing, 
and I am glad to have a chance to be here to see all of you and 
ask some questions.
    So I want to focus on the issue of some of the exploitive 
practices we are seeing around land contracts. Just earlier 
this month I chaired a hearing in my Housing Subcommittee on 
land contracts. These are arrangements such as lease-to-
purchase or rent-to-own agreements that can be highly 
exploitive, and they often target home buyers in underserved 
communities, particularly those of color. In my home State of 
Minnesota, these products have been targeted at many people in 
the Somali community.
    The terms of these arrangements are often misrepresented or 
not fully disclosed, which means that buyers are facing 
unexpected fees and penalties, which only compound their 
challenges. And this can be a big deal.
    So what this is, is essentially somebody enters into a 
contract, as you know, where they are leasing or renting to 
own, but they do not end up owning the property until the very 
last payment is made. And if one thing goes wrong then they 
lose all of the equity that they have put into that home. They 
lose all of the rent. They are basically left high and dry, and 
this can be really significant.
    One of the witnesses at our hearing testified that his 
organization, which works to help folks that have been abused 
by this process, have helped to forgive $130,000 in penalties 
and fees and charges for 40 families, so really significant.
    My question is to the attorney general and also to Ms. 
Siegel. I understand that both of you have some experience with 
this kind of home financing, and I am wondering what you have 
observed in your work and what advice you have for us as we 
think about how to protect people from these exploitive kinds 
of contracts?
    Ms. Henry. If I may.
    Senator Smith. Yes, please, Ms. Henry.
    Ms. Henry. Yes. We have seen this. We have had two recent 
rather large cases against Harbor Portfolio and Vision 
Properties where it was exactly as you described, where 
individuals, consumers were attempting to be able to get 
properties and rent to own. And in the end, again, what we saw 
was it lacked transparency.
    Senator Smith. Right.
    Ms. Henry. So the details are buried deep, or they are 
never fully explained, and the fine print allows them to take 
away the equity that these individuals have built up, with some 
minor transgression, and they are completely unaware. And 
again, I think the critical piece to this is to require that 
all of these companies are up front with the individuals, so 
they understand exactly what they are signing up for, exactly 
what they are getting into, and can make a decision based on 
that, as opposed to being so far in and then to lose and owe so 
much more money. It is a vicious cycle that they are unable to 
get out of, as a result of not being up front and transparent.
    Senator Smith. Right, and I know attorneys general around 
the country are working on this, and this idea of increased 
transparency has been brought up as a solution. Another 
solution has been to--the way that this occurs for people is 
that they are faced with complete forfeiture rather than any 
kind of a foreclosure process. So I wonder, maybe Ms. Siegel, 
if you would like to comment on that, or if anybody would like 
to comment on that.
    Ms. Siegal. Thank you, Senator. We do see those types of 
cases at Atlanta Legal Aid, often called contract for deed or 
rent to own. What we see is that potential homeowners do often 
forfeit any potential equity that they may have had after 
paying over months or years on a contract. They also pay very 
high downpayment type fees and monthly option fees. And even 
though some of these rent-to-own companies say that those fees 
are refundable, when you look at the fine print you find that 
they actually forfeit all those fees if the tenant is not 
ultimately able to purchase the home.
    We also find that there are very high failure rates. Not 
many people that come to us are actually able to become 
successful and become homeowners at the end of the day, and we 
think that is problematic.
    Senator Smith. The testimony before our Subcommittee really 
talked about how, in many ways, these contracts are designed to 
fail. It is not just like, oh, it is just not working out most 
of the time. When it is 80-plus percent of the time they are 
failing and people are losing all of their equity then it is 
designed to fail, and that is, I think, something that there is 
an opportunity for us to work on.
    And I want to just also point, before I yield back, Mr. 
Chair, that in some parts of our economy, and in Minnesota, for 
example, contracts for deed are used by folks in agriculture, 
young folks that are getting into buying land, and they can be 
used in a non-exploitive way. But the ways in which these 
contracts are being used to really take advantage of people, I 
think we need to focus on, and there is a lot that we can do.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chair Warnock. Thank you very much, Senator Smith.
    Senator Warren.
    Senator Warren. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and 
thank you for holding this hearing today.
    Earlier this month, the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau ordered Bank of America to pay $100 million to its 
customers for illegally charging fees, withholding credit card 
rewards, and opening fake bank accounts. Now I know what you 
are thinking--fake accounts, illegal fees, fraudulent credit 
card practices, I have seen this movie before. Is this deja vu 
all over again?
    Name your favorite big bank--Bank of America, Wells Fargo, 
JPMorgan Chase--and chances are that the CFPB has caught them 
red-handed engaging in any one of these tricks, at least one 
and sometimes all at the same time.
    Consider overdraft. Overdraft fees, the charge you get if 
you spend more money than you have in your bank account, 
squeezed as much as tens of billions of dollars out of 
consumers' pockets every year. The banks claim that these fees 
help consumers by allowing banks to offer overdraft protection 
to those who want it.
    So Attorney General Henry, you have spent years prosecuting 
consumer protection violations. You are someone who has seen up 
close the junk fee tricks that financial institutions use to 
nickel and dime consumers for their last buck. So let me ask 
you, are these fees good for consumers, like the banks claim?
    Ms. Henry. Thank you for the question. No, they are 
definitely not good for the consumers. In fact, in April of 
2022, we urged the biggest banks to follow Citi and Capital One 
to eliminate harmful junk fees, overdraft fees, nonsufficient 
fund fees. And the truth is they hit families of color harder 
and often result in account closures, leaving them unbanked. 
Ninety percent of these fees are paid by a small subset, and 
they generally pay three or more a year while earning less than 
$50,000. And the truth is, typically the costs of the bank to 
cover unfunded transactions is far lower than the fee.
    Senator Warren. So as I understand it, the fee to the 
consumer can be as high as $37, and you are saying the actual 
cost to the bank----
    Ms. Henry. Much less.
    Senator Warren. ----much less than that.
    You know, for Bank of America, hitting consumers with a 
single $35 overdraft fee was not enough. They were caught 
double-dipping, charging multiple fees for the same 
transaction, earning them hundreds of millions of dollars over 
a 3 \1/2\-year period.
    Now banks know that these fees are junk, and that is why 
many of these banks recently announced changes to their 
overdraft policies. At the same time that Bank of America was 
breaking the law, it made a splashy announcement early last 
year that it would lower its overdraft fees and reduce its 
overdraft-related revenue by 90 percent. But the fact of the 
matter is that Bank of America still took in nearly $400 
million in overdraft fees from families last year, and 
altogether big banks raked in more than $7.7 billion in these 
fees.
    Attorney General Henry, now that we know that $7.7 billion 
is not a ton of money to a big bank like Bank of America, it is 
just icing on the cake for them, but it is a lot of money to 
low-income families that are forced to fork it over. Do you 
believe that the big banks, like Bank of America, should 
eliminate overdraft fees?
    Ms. Henry. Yes.
    Senator Warren. That was very direct. Good. I will take 
that.
    You know, despite continuing to rake in billions in revenue 
from predatory overdraft fees, and continuing to get caught 
charging these fees illegally, the bank lobby holds up the 
changes they have made to their overdraft policies as evidence 
that these giant banks can be trusted to do the right thing on 
their own and that they do not need stronger rules that would 
protect consumers from predatory overdraft fees. And let's not 
forget, these are the same banks that are bankrolling the 
attacks on the CFPB.
    So Attorney General Henry, given their propensity for 
repeated lawbreaking, do you think the giant banks can be 
trusted to act in the best interest of consumers without 
stronger rules and vigorous enforcement?
    Ms. Henry. Well, if history is any lesson we know that they 
cannot be trusted to act in the best interest of consumers on 
their own. Look, they are in the business of making money for 
their shareholders, and we need robust consumer protection 
rules enforcement to ensure that.
    Senator Warren. Yeah. I have no problem with the banks 
making a profit, but not like this. You know, the big banks 
have proven, over and over, that they will abuse their power to 
no end in their endless pursuit of profits. The CFPB has shown 
that it will stop them in their tracks, and we need to keep it 
that way.
    Over the past 12 years, the CFPB has returned $17 billion 
to American families cheated by financial institutions, money 
that otherwise would have stayed in the pockets of Wall Street 
executives. I am proud of the work that the CFPB has achieved, 
and I look forward to working with my colleagues to support 
their work in the future.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Warnock. Thank you very much, Senator Warren.
    Ranking Member Tillis.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you. Just a brief question, and a 
statement again to General Henry and Ms. Siegel. What you are 
witnessing here, I think, is not Members saying that we should 
not have transparency, that a consumer should know what it 
costs at the time that they make a financial commitment. What 
we are really having a discussion here is, I think Chair 
Warnock or one of the Members, suggested we just need to give 
the regulators more authority.
    So what we are talking about here is not the ``what.'' It 
is the ``how.'' And I, for one, do not think that the 
regulators who have demonstrated pushing the boundaries of 
their authority, giving them more authority, is a good idea if 
we are coming up with a real bipartisan, sustainable solution. 
I think that comes by saying the practices that you 
demonstrated are wrong. How do we deal with that? And as a 
matter of Congress, how do we agree that that should look?
    The problem we have here, too, when we transfer power out 
of Congress to another branch is that it changes every 4 years 
or so. So you may be thrilled with a regulatory regimen that 
comes out from the CFPB today, but because of the way they have 
behaved it would be one of the first things I would work to 
repeal if the Administration changed and withdraw it.
    So I think we have an opportunity here, if we realize that 
there are probably extremes at either end who are not going to 
be satisfied, but the problem that you all identified has been 
addressed. I think it should be the purview of Congress.
    So Mr. Johnson, could you speak a little bit about the 
efforts and the lengths the CFPB goes in an effort to avoid 
judicial review and skirt the APA process, because that 
provides a little bit more context for behaviors that concern 
me about empowering regulators to do more. But if you could 
just give a few examples, then I am done, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Senator. So as you know, the APA 
requires agencies to go through a full public notice and 
comment process to solicit the views of the public regarding a 
rule proposal, and that process takes time, although it is 
incredibly important to do so. So for some agencies there is an 
incentive to skirt that process because it takes that time to 
go through that careful deliberation.
    We have seen trends of agencies like the CFPB issuing 
guidance, for instance, the CFPB's new form of guidance called 
circulars, which are meant to advise other enforcement 
agencies----
    Senator Tillis. Does the industry do that as guidance, or 
do they do it as a de facto rule that they better adhere to?
    Mr. Johnson. It is viewed as a de facto rule, and that is 
the game that is played, which is labeling it as a statement of 
policy as opposed to going through the full rulemaking process, 
but banking on the idea that industry will treat it as a 
mandatory obligation.
    Senator Tillis. By not going through the full process of 
notice and public comment, are we not missing the opportunity 
to identify some of the very unintended outcomes that consumers 
may ultimately bear the burden of?
    Mr. Johnson. Absolutely, and Congress has specified that 
the CFPB has to go through a fulsome cost-benefit analysis 
under its Section 1022 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you.
    Senator Warren. Mr. Chairman, might I ask a question?
    Chair Warnock. Yes, by all means.
    Senator Warren. I would like to follow up with the same 
witness. Is the CFPB the only agency that issues guidance?
    Mr. Johnson. It is not. In my written testimony I point out 
the trend that the agency----
    Senator Warren. And you have data on the trend.
    Mr. Johnson. Well, I pointed out several instances of 
guidance----
    Senator Warren. The plural of anecdote is not data. You 
have data on the trend?
    Mr. Johnson. I have pointed out the instances of the CFPB's 
efforts with respect to the President's junk fee initiative 
what I think are skirting APA requirements.
    Senator Warren. So the question I was asking you, is the 
CFPB the only agency that does guidance?
    Senator Tillis. No, and to be honest----
    Mr. Johnson. No, Senator, it is not.
    Senator Tillis. ----if I may answer that question, no. 
Several of them do, and Senator Warren, it is one of the 
reasons why when we see guidance, speeches, memos, letters, 
suggestions, that we think ultimately rise to a rule, we get an 
accounting of that, and we try to have that particular policy 
position withdrawn or just subjected to the Administrative 
Procedures Act.
    Senator Warren. Well----
    Senator Tillis. And it is rampant in the financial 
regulators. So no, it is not just about the CFPB.
    Senator Warren. And that is my only point. Is the CFPB, the 
OCC, the Fed, the IRS, guidance is a part of how they explain 
to the industry the agency's view of emerging practices, for 
example. If there is a problem I would really like to see the 
data on it. Thank you.
    Chair Warnock. With that, all questioning has concluded. 
And look, I would invite our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, if they feel that something is amiss here and they 
are interested, if they think Congress needs to get involved, I 
look forward to their suggestions about how we strengthen 
regulations to protect consumers. I do think they can wait 
another day as we deal with, whether we are talking about 
housing in Atlanta or the bank fees that others face all across 
our country.
    Thanks to our witnesses for being with us today. Thank you 
again to Ranking Member Tillis for your partnership with 
holding this hearing.
    And this is the Senate Banking Committee's first hearing on 
junk fees as Congress. I look forward to more to come. This 
hearing highlights how Congress and this Administration are 
focusing on lowering costs for the American people. There is a 
difference between offering a service that will lend a hand and 
offering a service that will kick someone while they are down.
    I am grateful to the work that the CFPB and the FTC are 
doing to tackle predatory junk fees. Clearly there is a lot 
more work to be done in this space. Lowering or eliminating 
onerous fees is something I will keep pushing for through 
legislation, by working with the business community, when 
necessary, and by working with regulators to stop bad actors 
from taking advantage of working Americans through rulemaking 
as well as by providing guidance.
    This topic is about saving people money, creating an 
economy that works for all Americans, and ensuring that 
hardworking families are not swindled out of a shot at 
financial stability.
    For Senators who wish to submit questions for the record, 
those questions are due 1 week from today. For our witnesses, 
you will have 45 days to respond to any questions.
    Thank you all again, and with that this hearing is 
adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 10:33 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

                PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHELLE A. HENRY
             Attorney General, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
                             July 26, 2023
    Good Morning Chairman Warnock, Ranking Member Tillis, Members of 
the Committee. Thank you for inviting me to testify today. My name is 
Michelle Henry, and I am the Attorney General of Pennsylvania. I joined 
the office in January 2017 as First Deputy Attorney General, and I 
became Attorney General in January 2023.
    This Subcommittee is right to focus its attention on junk fees 
because they harm both businesses and consumers. Honest businesses lose 
out to competitors who charge junk fees because the competitors' prices 
appear (at first) to be a better deal. This problem is often compounded 
by Internet lead generators that steer consumers to the companies 
charging the junk fees. Consumers end up paying more than they expected 
for a product or service. Junk fees prevent consumers from effectively 
shopping for the best overall price. This hinders the functioning of a 
competitive marketplace.
    While the phrase ``junk fees'' is a relatively new way of 
describing surprise charges, our work in combatting these practices 
goes back many decades. Today, I want to tell you about the work we 
have done in recent years, in three markets where junk fees have become 
more and more pervasive: consumer finance, landlord tenant, and hotels.
Consumer Finance
    In the consumer finance space, our landmark junk fees case is a 
multistate lawsuit against Mariner Finance, a Wall Street private 
equity-owned installment lender. Our lawsuit alleges that Mariner 
charged consumers junk fees for hidden add-on products that consumers 
either did not know about or did not agree to buy. Consumers left 
Mariner believing they had entered into an agreement to borrow and 
repay, over time, a certain amount of money. In reality, because of 
these hidden junk fees, Mariner added hundreds to thousands of dollars 
to the total amount a consumer owed. Mariner compounds the problem by 
pushing many consumers to put down their car title as collateral, 
trapping them in loans that are inflated by junk fees.
    The cost of the Mariner's junk fees is staggering: for a random 
sample of loans originated in Pennsylvania in December 2020, Mariner 
charged each consumer an average of $1,085 in junk fees for an average 
of $3,394 in cash borrowed. In the aggregate, Mariner charged 
Pennsylvanians more than $27 million in junk fees and interest for add-
ons from 2015 to 2018. \1\ Nationwide, Mariner charged consumers over 
$120 million in junk fees for add-on products in 2019.

predatorypersonal-lending-company/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We filed the Mariner lawsuit in Federal court in Philadelphia 
together with four other attorneys general: New Jersey, Washington, 
Oregon, and the District of Columbia. We are using the authority that 
Congress granted us to enforce the Dodd-Frank Act. We are asking the 
Court to order that Mariner: (1) refund of all junk fees and associated 
interest, (2) pay penalties, and (3) stop charging junk fees, among 
other relief.
    We announced a significant junk fee settlement in 2018 with Wells 
Fargo. \2\ The media widely covered the first Wells Fargo scandal--
where the bank opened millions of bank accounts without the customers' 
knowledge. But the much more harmful conduct was uncovered later: the 
$385 million in junk fees Wells charged its auto finance customers for 
so-called force-placed car insurance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \2\ https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/attorney-
general-shapiro-announces-575-million-50-statesettlement-with-wells-
fargo-bank-for-opening-unauthorized-accounts-and-charging-consumers-
for-unnecessaryauto-insurance-mortgage-fees/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Despite evidence that many customers already had the required car 
insurance, Wells Fargo improperly charged premiums, interest, and fees 
for force-placed insurance to more than two million accounts. In 
addition, Wells Fargo refunded more than $100 million in mortgage junk 
fees because it improperly charged mortgage consumers for rate lock 
extension fees even when the delay was caused by Wells Fargo. To 
resolve the multistate action, Wells Fargo agreed to pay the States 
$575 million. This was in addition to the consumer refunds I mentioned, 
and on top of another $2.3 billion the bank paid to resolve other 
regulatory and class actions.
    I want to address an argument that companies such as Mariner 
sometimes make. Predatory lenders often argue that their overpriced 
loans are necessary to help consumers make ends meet in a moment of 
dire need, such as unexpected car repairs. But we know from empirical 
research that far more predatory loans are taken out to meet recurring 
expenses than for emergencies. \3\ Consumers in Pennsylvania often tell 
our office that they regret taking out their loan from a high-cost 
lender. Many times they tell us the lender pushed them to borrow more 
than they wanted or needed. And often they were led to the lender by an 
online lead generator that purports to be helping the consumer find the 
best deal available.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \3\ For example, The Pew Charitable Trusts found that 69 percent 
of payday loans are taken out for recurring expenses, with only 16 
percent for unexpected emergencies, 8 percent for ``something 
special,'' and 2 percent for ``other.'' The Pew Charitable Trusts, 
``Safe Small-Dollar Loans Research Project, Payday Lending in America: 
Who Borrows, Where They Borrow, and Why'', at 8, 13 (2012), available 
at https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2012/07/
19/whoborrows-where-they-borrow-and-why.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In reality, most consumers would be better off getting an auto 
refinance loan or an installment loan at their local credit union or 
community bank rather than going to an expensive installment lender 
that charges junk fees.
    Finally, I want to note that in April 2022 we joined other 
attorneys general in urging the \4\ CEOs of the biggest banks--JPMorgan 
Chase, Bank of America, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo--to follow the lead 
of Citi and Capital One and eliminate harmful junk fees such as 
overdraft fees and nonsufficient fund fees. Overdraft fees hit families 
and communities of color harder than others. They start a vicious cycle 
that drives them deeper and deeper into debt. Eliminating these fees 
helps create a system that works for everyone.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Landlord Tenant
    We have brought several landlord tenant cases against landlords 
charging junk fees, particularly in areas where many tenants are first-
time renters, such as in State College, where Penn State University is 
located. For example, last year we settled with a landlord that 
illegally charged a 15 percent Administrative Charge on top of damage 
charges assessed against tenants' security deposits. In addition, the 
company's leases gave landlords the right to apply $100 of each 
tenant's share of the security deposit towards repairing damage to 
shared common areas. The collection of these charges without proof that 
actual damage was caused by a specific tenant is illegal under the 
Pennsylvania Landlord and Tenant Act.
    Another landlord against whom we are currently litigating has 
allegedly unlawfully charged his tenants hundreds and sometimes 
thousands of dollars for normal wear and tear and maintenance. \5\ This 
allows him to unlawfully retain all or significant portions of tenants' 
security deposits, padding his profits at the expense of his tenants 
and his competition.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hotels and Ticket Platforms
    We have also worked hard to stop hotel companies and concert 
promoters from charging junk fees. In 2020, we announced a settlement 
with Event Ticket Sales LLC and its owner because they had been 
charging fees that consumers never agreed to pay. They also refused to 
honor their refund policy. As part of our settlement, the company 
agreed to provide full refunds for all Pennsylvania consumers who 
purchased tickets for events that were canceled.
    In 2021, we announced a landmark junk fees settlement with Marriott 
International. For many years, travelers have been misled by the 
published rates offered by hotels for a night's stay only later to be 
hit with mandatory ``resort fees'' when they are checking in. Thanks to 
our settlement, \6\ Marriott now has a policy in place to be upfront 
and transparent in the disclosure of mandatory fees, including resort 
fees, as part of the total price of a hotel stay--allowing consumers to 
compare total costs for hotels and find the one that is the best fit 
for them. Marriott was the first hotel chain to formally commit to the 
upfront disclosure of resort fees as part of the initial advertised 
price.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

action-requires-marriott-to-disclose-resort-fees/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Of course, our fight against junk fees is one we cannot win on our 
own. We are working closely with our fellow States, as well as our 
Federal law enforcement partners. We have a particularly close 
relationship with the CFPB because we have partnered with them on major 
cases, including most recently the Trident Mortgage redlining 
settlement in the Philadelphia region. That case, which also involved 
the Department of Justice and the attorneys general of New Jersey and 
Delaware, will provide $18.4 million in loan subsidies that will spur 
hundreds of millions of dollars in new mortgages to majority-minority 
neighborhoods.
    We have also sent comment letters to the CFPB in support of several 
of its initiatives, including the junk fees request for information. In 
our April 2022 letter, \7\ we said that we share the Bureau's broad 
concern about the proliferation of junk fees, and we wrote about 
convenience fees imposed by mortgage servicers. Fees charged to make a 
mortgage payment (such as by phone or through a third party) are 
particularly insidious because, unlike in other marketplaces, consumers 
have no choice of who will be their mortgage servicer, and they cannot 
switch servicers.

General-Multistate-Comment-Letter-to-CFPB-conveniencefees-41122.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We commend the CFPB for taking supervisory action against mortgage 
servicers that have charged junk fees, \8\ and we encourage it to 
consider banning or significantly restricting convenience fees in 
markets where consumers do not have the ability to take their business 
elsewhere to avoid the fees. And I look forward to continuing to work 
closely with the CFPB and Director Rohit Chopra on cases and policy 
initiatives.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ultimately, our work battling junk fees protects not only 
consumers, but also honest businesses. For example, not only does 
Mariner Finance harm a consumer when it charges her thousands of 
dollars in hidden junk fees, but it also harms the local community bank 
or credit union that might have otherwise earned the consumer's 
business. By ensuring that prices are truly transparent, we protect 
businesses from being undercut by ``cheaper'' or ``faster'' competitors 
that rip off consumers with hidden fees. This is especially true in an 
era where more and more consumers are shopping online, and many 
websites sort their products or services by the upfront price or APR.
    Thank you for inviting me to testify today, and I am happy to 
answer any questions.

                  PREPARED STATEMENT OF LINDSEY SIEGEL
        Director of Housing Advocacy, Atlanta Legal Aid Society
                             July 26, 2023
    Good morning Chairman Warnock, Ranking Member Tillis, and Members 
of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf 
of the low-income clients of the Atlanta Legal Aid Society about 
predatory rental fees and the burdens these fees place on the families 
we serve. My name is Lindsey Siegel, and I'm the Director of Housing 
Advocacy at Atlanta Legal Aid. \1\ Atlanta Legal Aid provides free 
legal services to families living in poverty in the five-county metro 
Atlanta area. We assist individuals who have a range of civil legal 
issues, but today I will focus on the rental housing market and the 
business model where institutional landlords gouge families living in 
poverty by charging junk fees that make rental housing unaffordable for 
many low-income families.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \1\ In my 10 years at Atlanta Legal Aid, I have represented 
hundreds of low-income tenants in Federal and State court to challenge 
discrimination, address unfair practices, and enforce their civil and 
legal rights. As Director of Housing Advocacy, I lead the 
organization's housing litigation and advocacy strategy, represent 
clients directly, maintain expertise on local and national housing 
protections, and serve as a resource to other lawyers and housing 
advocates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Atlanta Legal Aid's Representation of Low-Income Renters
    Since 1924, Atlanta Legal Aid Society has offered free civil legal 
aid for low-income people across metro Atlanta. With five neighborhood 
offices, three offices in Children's Healthcare of Atlanta hospitals, 
three county courthouse projects, a variety of self-help clinics, and 
countless community education programs, Legal Aid lawyers and 
volunteers represent low-income individuals in 20,000 cases every year.
    Atlanta Legal Aid is all too familiar with the burdens facing low-
income renters. Since the pandemic began, roughly half of the 
individuals we serve each year contact us about a landlord-tenant legal 
problem. \2\ We represent tenants in a range of rental housing issues, 
including eviction defense, challenging illegal practices, connecting 
tenants with rental assistance, filing lawsuits to address 
discrimination and systemic inequities, and more.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \2\ Before the pandemic, about one third of Atlanta Legal Aid 
cases involved a landlord-tenant issue.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ms. Dixon \3\ is a single mother who found an apartment in the fall 
of 2020. At the height of the pandemic, she searched online for a place 
she could afford. She found a two-bedroom apartment that advertised a 
rent of just under $1,400 per month. This rate was at the top end of 
what she could afford, but she looked at her budget and determined it 
would be possible. The apartment listing did not list any other fees 
she would be required to pay. She applied for the apartment and paid 
$525 through the landlord's online portal which was supposed to cover 
her $50 application fee, a $175 move-in fee, and a $300 screening fee. 
All these fees were nonrefundable. She was not able to see the lease or 
the apartment she'd be renting, but she knew if she did not pay sight 
unseen, she would lose the apartment to someone else.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \3\ I am using a pseudonym to protect our client's identity; the 
facts have not been changed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A few weeks later, Ms. Dixon's landlord approved her application. 
She finally received and reviewed a copy of her lease 2 days before she 
was slated to move in. It was 50 pages long and contained 8 different 
addenda. She expected to pay her rent and pay for water. She didn't 
expect to be responsible for a package locker fee, a trash removal fee, 
a separate valet trash fee, a pest control fee, a technology package 
fee, an insurance fee, and a credit reporting fee, all of which were 
buried in the lease agreement. She also didn't know she would be 
charged a one-time $200 approval fee. To make matters worse, Ms. 
Dixon's landlord did not accept the rent by cash, check, or money 
order. She either had to pay through Money Gram, which itself charges a 
fee, or pay through the landlord's online portal, which charged her an 
astonishing $72 per month ``convenience fee.'' When Ms. Dixon contacted 
our office a year later, she was paying $230 more per month than her 
expected rent.
Junk Fees Disproportionately Harm Low-Income Families
    When landlords surprise low-income tenants with hidden fees or 
charge them more than the cost of actually providing a service, they 
make rental housing even more unaffordable and exacerbate the 
challenges that low-income renters are already facing to maintain 
housing and financial security for their families. \4\ Many of the 
renters Atlanta Legal Aid serves have already seen skyrocketing rents 
and monthly rent increases of $300 or more each time they've renewed a 
lease in the past three years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \4\ See Ariel Nelson, April Kuehnhoff, Chi Chi Wu, and Steve 
Sharpe, ``Too Damn High: How Junk Fees Add to Skyrocketing Rents'' 
(Mar. 13, 2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Because three out of every four families who qualify for federally 
subsidized housing don't have it, \5\ most low-income families already 
struggle to find the most affordable private housing they can. In 
Georgia, 46 percent of all renters are cost-burdened, meaning they pay 
more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs. \6\ The 
unaffordability is most pronounced for Black renters, 54 percent of 
whom are cost burdened, and over half of those severely so, meaning 
they pay more than 50 percent of their income on housing. \7\

    Although junk rental fees affect all aspects of the rental market, 
they place a disproportionate burden on the livelihoods of low-income 
families. Atlanta Legal Aid's low-income clients understand the risk of 
not paying rent, and the vast majority will avoid it at all cost. As 
Matthew Desmond put it, the rent eats first. \8\ Families who can't 
afford junk fees will cut from other areas in their lives: food, 
medicine, clothing, transportation to work, doctor's visits, or 
internet that their children need to complete school assignments. They 
will forgo other basic needs to avoid becoming homeless.

Investor Landlords Drive Fees
    In the communities Atlanta Legal Aid serves, institutional and 
investor landlords are the main culprits of using junk and hidden fees 
to help drive profits. And these companies have invested heavily in the 
Atlanta area since the 2008 recession. The Atlanta Journal Constitution 
recently reported that across metro Atlanta, 65,000 single family homes 
have been converted to an investment product by Wall Street companies 
in the last decade. \9\ Just two companies--Invitation Homes and 
Progress Residential, own 10,000 properties each in Atlanta. Many of 
the low-income families we serve who rent single family homes have an 
institution as their landlord. In 2022 research conducted through UC 
Berkeley, the authors reported that Invitation Homes, one of the 
largest institutional landlords of single-family homes in the country, 
was on track to earn more than $30 million in what they deem 
``ancillary fees'' that year alone. \10\

Investors Elbow Out Individual Home Buyers'', Atlanta Journal 
Constitution (Feb. 9, 2023).

Market Power: What Does the Single-Family Rental Boom Mean for Our 
Housing Future?'' U.C. Berkeley (Apr. 13, 2022).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Investor owners of multifamily properties, like the owner of Ms. 
Dixon's apartment, are just as fond of using junk fees to drive up the 
cost of housing. And like investors of single-family homes, they 
unfairly compete against local landlords by masking their actual 
prices. So far, this trend has not infected so called mom-and-pop 
landlords or smaller landlords with strong ties to the communities 
Atlanta serves. One landlord recently summed it up best--many local 
landlords are community landlords: they live, work in, and have ties to 
their communities. These investment companies are commodity landlords.
    The low-income renters coming to Atlanta Legal Aid have an extreme 
power imbalance with their landlords--the high demand for rental 
housing, especially at the more affordable end of the market, makes 
some landlords believe they can easily get away with unfair and 
deceptive lease terms and rental practices. The bait and switch Ms. 
Dixon experienced, where the landlord advertised the rent as one price 
only to raise it much higher with junk fees, is a far too common 
practice of many investor landlords in the Atlanta area. When a low-
income renter pays hundreds of dollars in application and upfront fees 
before even seeing a lease, they feel stuck. These renters often can't 
afford to walk away from a lease with hidden fees and pay that same 
amount to apply somewhere else, even once they realize the rent will be 
unaffordable.
Application and Tenant Screening Fees Are an Unregulated Source of
        Profit
    Of particular concern are how many institutional landlords charge 
high application fees, ostensibly to conduct a tenant background check. 
These fees often far exceed the cost of running a report, and most 
renters have to pay them several times before finding a home to rent.
    Many of our low-income clients spend hundreds of dollars on 
application fees before being accepted. A renter applying often has no 
way of knowing whether the landlord actually checked their credit, or 
even if the home is still available. When their application is denied, 
they hardly ever find out the exact reason for their denial. Then, when 
a rejected tenant applies for the next home, she is forced to pay the 
fee again, for the same background check. And though products exist to 
enable an applicant to pay one time for a report that can be used 
repeatedly within 30 days, very few landlords accept those reports.
    One property manager reported to Atlanta Legal Aid that she was 
aware of some unscrupulous companies using these fees to unfairly 
profit by collecting applications from more renters than they have 
homes available. She described how one company in particular kept 
rental homes listed on its website for weeks after it had already found 
a renter, because by charging $75 per adult in the household, the 
company could continue to collect without actually considering each 
tenant's application.
    Renters of color are particularly harmed by unregulated application 
fees. They are far more likely to be turned down after paying an 
application fee and often pay more in application fees before being 
accepted. A recent Georgetown Law Review article surmised that high 
application fees likely steer renters of color toward lower quality 
housing in lower opportunity areas where they perceive their chances of 
being approved are higher. \11\ In other words, the ubiquity of 
application fees is likely driving residential segregation. Atlanta 
Legal Aid has seen the effects play out with the renters of color we 
serve--those who used to live in intown neighborhoods have been pushed 
further outside the city, to areas where schools are lower performing, 
transportation is more challenging, housing is lower quality, and jobs 
are harder to find.

Fees Should Be Both Transparent and Fair
    As the White House recently announced, a lack of transparency is 
just one of the problems of junk fees. \12\ Even when fees are 
disclosed to tenants, many cover services that used to be included in 
the rent, that tenants don't want or can get cheaper on their own, or 
that cost far less than the landlord is charging. Many institutional 
landlords are charging fees that in no way mirror the cost of providing 
that service--for instance, by charging two trash fees to each renter 
per month, by charging a $10 mandatory HVAC filter fee each month, or 
by imposing a $40 fee each month to send a late rent letter (in 
addition to a hefty late fee). Or they charge fees for services tenants 
would expect to be included in the rent, like a $10 common area 
electric fee or a $25 property management fee. Many investor landlords 
also profit by prohibiting tenants from paying rent by cash or money 
order. Instead, like Ms. Dixon, many of Atlanta Legal Aid's clients 
have to pay extra just to pay their rent through an online portal.

The Federal Government Can Step in To Help Low-Income Tenants
    The proliferation of these abusive fees demonstrates the need for 
specific protection for tenants. Even in States with good legal 
protections, tenants usually need legal representation to have any hope 
of effectively challenging junk fees. In States with poor or 
nonexistent legal protections or where legal representation is not 
available, such challenges may not be possible.
    Atlanta Legal Aid participated in the response to the request for 
public comment that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and 
Federal Trade Commission used to learn more about unfair and deceptive 
tenant screening practices. CFPB in particular has an opportunity to 
investigate and initiate enforcement actions against companies whose 
tenant screening practices are unfair and deceptive, and harm 
consumers. Atlanta Legal Aid also attended listening sessions with the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to share our clients' 
stories about the burden junk fees have on their financial security. 
Stronger Federal regulation could help define what is excessive and 
give States, advocates, and renters new tools to combat these fees. We 
are glad that this Subcommittee, the White House, HUD, FTC, and CFPB 
are all concerned about fairness and transparency in the rental market.
    Thank you for the opportunity to share our clients' experiences 
with you today. I look forward to answering any questions you have.

        RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF CHAIR WARNOCK
                     FROM MICHELLE A. HENRY

Q.1. In your work, what are some common characteristics of the 
bad actors utilizing predatory, hidden, and other junk fees?

A.1. We have seen junk fees across a variety of marketplaces: 
consumer finance, housing, event ticketing, hotels, and 
vacation rental. The most common characteristic is that the bad 
actor engages in what has been coined ``drip pricing'' or more 
accurately ``drip, drip, drip pricing'': meaning the actor 
advertises its products and obtains consumer leads on the 
internet, where consumers, search engines, and lead generators 
often sort by price. The bad actor advertises an artificially 
low price at the point when the consumer is shopping around. In 
the case of vacation planning or event ticketing, consumers and 
their families and friends may spend hours, days, or weeks 
comparing options and prices across a variety of websites. 
Eventually the consumers settle on what they think is the best 
option for them--and, of course, the price is a critical factor 
for nearly all consumers.
    Then, at the end of all this research and shopping, the 
consumer moves forward to book the hotel, short term rental, or 
event tickets, only to find that the price is much higher than 
advertised. Consumers are forced to either accept the higher 
price or go back to the drawing board, wasting hours of their 
time and the time of their family and friends with whom they 
plan to vacation or attend an event. In the case of resort 
fees, because of inadequate disclosure on booking websites, 
consumers may not learn about the fees until they are checking 
into the hotel. Faced with this dilemma, many consumers simply 
pay the junk fees. This harms consumers, and it harms the 
honest businesses that do not charge junk fees.
    In the financial services space, I described in my 
testimony our lawsuit against Mariner Finance, which charges 
consumers enormous hidden fees. Mariner, like the ticketing and 
vacation companies, does not advertise its hidden fees on its 
website. Our investigation found that most consumers who get a 
loan with add-on products from Mariner have no idea they are 
being charged for add-ons, because Mariner rushes them through 
the loan closing process. And the cost that these hidden add-
ons is staggering: an average of nearly $1,100 per loan for one 
random sample of Pennsylvania consumers.
    Given the sky-high interest rates and hidden add-on fees 
that Mariner charges, most consumers would be better off 
getting an auto refinance loan or an installment loan at their 
local credit union or community bank. But consumers who shop 
online are steered to lenders like Mariner because community 
banks and credit unions do not buy online loan leads in the 
same volume that Mariner does. And other consumers end up with 
a Mariner loan after the company mails them unsolicited ``live 
checks'' that merely require endorsement and deposit to trigger 
a loan transaction. After a consumer cashes a live check, 
Mariner immediately begins soliciting the consumer by phone, 
email, and other methods to come into the branch and borrow 
additional money by refinancing the loan. Consumers who 
refinance are typically charged hundreds or thousands of 
dollars for hidden add-on products.
    We must continue to take action to stop junk fees in all 
these markets. If Congress and enforcement agencies fail to 
act, honest businesses will lose market share and be pressured 
to copy the bad actors to make their prices look as low as the 
dishonest competition. This ``race to the bottom'' is what 
happened in the mortgage market in the early 2000s, when--while 
many regulators failed to act--mortgage lenders lost market 
share and felt pressure to copy the predatory and unsustainable 
practices of the bad actors (such as pay-option adjustable rate 
mortgages with high prepayment penalties). This ultimately led 
to the mortgage foreclosure crisis and the Great Recession.

Q.2. Do victims of those that utilize predatory fees tend to 
share similar income levels, backgrounds, or levels of 
education attainment?

A.2. In general, I think junk fees affect consumers across the 
economic spectrum. Hotel companies, short term rentals, event 
ticketing websites--they cater to consumers of all incomes and 
education levels.
    In the financial services space, junk fees for hidden add-
on products and overdraft fees have a disproportionate impact 
on low-and-moderate income consumers. For example, as alleged 
in our lawsuit, Mariner Finance targets its loans and 
aggressive sales tactics at the most vulnerable borrowers, 
offering low-and-moderate income consumers small dollar 
personal loans with high interest costs. These are often 
subprime and deep subprime borrowers with FICO scores of 629 or 
less. They often already have significant credit card, 
installment loan, and/or student loan debt.
    Similarly, in the rental housing market, we have seen 
predatory landlords take advantage of younger tenants, many of 
whom are first-time renters in places like State College, 
Pennsylvania. In the rental and hotel markets, more experienced 
consumers may challenge junk fees and have them waived or 
removed. This is another reason that harm from junk fees falls 
disproportionately on the most vulnerable consumers, such as 
elderly, low-income, and younger consumers.

Q.3. In your testimony, you discussed how junk fees often harm 
honest businesses that utilize up-front pricing. Do you see 
examples of consumers regularly paying more than the advertised 
price due to these business practices? Would you provide other 
examples of these types of fees that disadvantage honest 
businesses that provide consumers with transparent pricing?

A.3. Yes, we routinely see consumers paying more than the 
advertised price due to junk fees. Nearly every time consumers 
purchase a concert ticket or reserve a short term rental, they 
are paying junk fees. Concert ticket and short term rental 
websites force consumers to take extra steps to see the price 
with the mandatory fees--if they make it available at all 
before checkout. That's not right. And these mandatory fees are 
not small--they often add hundreds of dollars to the cost of 
the ticket or the vacation.
    Thanks to our settlement, Marriott now has a policy in 
place to be upfront and transparent in the disclosure of 
mandatory fees, including resort fees, as part of the total 
price of a hotel stay--allowing consumers to compare total 
costs for hotels and find the one that is the best fit for 
them. Marriott was the first hotel chain to formally commit to 
the upfront disclosure of resort fees as part of the initial 
advertised price.
    In the short-term rental market, the biggest companies 
charge huge fees to renters. When consumers are shopping for 
short-term rentals, they may think initially that the 
advertised price is the total price, and they may rely on it in 
choosing a property. In fact, the same exact property may be 
available for a far lower price through a different property 
manager or broker, since the smaller managers charge far lower 
fees than the leading websites.
    Even within the same site, ``hosts'' might charge their own 
junk fees by advertising an artificially low ``nightly rate'' 
in order to appear higher in the search, while charging a high 
``host fee'' or ``cleaning fee.'' This disadvantages the honest 
host who charges a more reasonable fee that reflects the actual 
costs of cleaning and turning over the rental unit. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \1\  For example, on one short-term rental website that sorts the 
search results by nightly rate, a host was recently offering to rent a 
3-bedroom house for $179 per night. But a two-night stay in this home 
actually costs $811--nearly five times the nightly rate--after adding a 
$355 ``host fee,'' a $98 ``service fee,'' and $68 in taxes. (Of the 
$811, the booking site keeps approximately $134: the ``service fee'' 
and up to 5 percent of the nightly rate and host fee.) The more 
transparent and fair way to structure the price would be for the 
booking site to include the (mandatory) service fee in the nightly rate 
and for the site to sort the search results by the average nightly 
price including all fees and taxes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If a fee is mandatory, companies should include it in the 
price of the product, period. And they should be straight 
forward about the fee from the ``get go.''

Q.4. When businesses include hidden fees in the final cost to 
consumers, it can create an unfair economic advantage for the 
businesses engaging in these practices and disadvantages 
businesses that engage in more transparent and customer-
friendly practices. How can State and Federal regulators level 
the playing field to encourage all businesses to advertise all-
inclusive, up-front pricing?
    Another issue involving junk fees being charged to a 
captive audience is on college campuses, where we are seeing 
instances of financial institutions forming partnerships with 
colleges and universities to market the financial products to 
students. This disproportionately affects young people, 
especially those who are the first in their family to go to 
college and who may not have had prior opportunities to open a 
bank account or credit card.

A.4. Charging hidden fees is already illegal. But many 
businesses operate in a gray area--they list the full price, 
but only on the last page (ticket sellers), which prevents 
consumers from shopping. Or they list the full price in much 
smaller print (short-term rentals) but sort search results 
based on a ``nightly rate'' which may have little relationship 
to the full price.
    State and Federal regulators should continue to enforce the 
laws that prohibit unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and 
practices. And Congress and State legislatures could consider 
adding stiffer penalties--and banning class action waivers--to 
enable consumers who are ripped off by junk fees to have their 
day in court.
    New rules would also help. We submitted a comment letter to 
the Federal Trade Commission in support of the regulations it 
is writing to mandate transparent pricing in the new and used 
car markets. We would also support new Federal rules or 
legislation to mandate that websites include all mandatory fees 
and charges in the advertised price. Consumers should not have 
to check a box or change the search filters to see the true 
price. If a fee is mandatory, it should also be disclosed as 
part of the price.
    College students are particularly vulnerable because they 
are just learning how to live on their own and manage their 
finances independently. We have seen landlords and banks take 
advantage of them. Overdraft fees are a particular problem for 
young people who are just getting started financially.

Q.5. Are you seeing trends emerge in this sector?

A.5. One alarming trend is the recent increase in the size of 
so-called ``service fees'' that event ticketing companies 
charge. As described above, these fees are typically added only 
at the very end of the shopping experience, during ``check 
out.'' Whereas the fees used to be around 2-3 percent to cover 
the cost of the credit card processing, we have seen event 
companies tack on fees of between 7 and 11 percent on top of 
the advertised price.
    The only way to stop these fees from continuing to grow is 
for event organizers to insist that all fees need to be 
included in the advertised, upfront price. But there seems to 
be a race to the bottom among event organizers and ticketing 
companies. Without pressure from Congress, State legislatures, 
and enforcement by Attorneys General, this trend will only get 
worse.

Q.6. What sort of long-term damage could these fees do to the 
ability for students and young people's ability to finance 
their education and participate in the economy both during and 
after college?

A.6. The Nation's crushing student loan burden has reduced many 
Americans' ability to save and spend as they see fit. It also 
harms the Commonwealth's larger economy because it diminishes 
these consumers' purchasing power, forcing them to delay buying 
a home, creating a business, or starting a family. In short, an 
entire generation is being held back by the shackles of student 
loan debt.
    Junk fees push consumers who are struggling to repay their 
student loans even deeper into debt. In some cases, such as the 
Mariner Finance hidden add-on products, junk fees can add 
nearly $1,100 to the cost of a loan. This harm can 
significantly delay younger Pennsylvanians from buying a home, 
starting a business, or having children.
    I am completely committed to stopping junk fees and 
requiring all companies to be transparent about their pricing. 
My message to the industry is simple: consumers should be able 
to shop on the Internet and buy a product for the advertised 
price. If all businesses had to be honest and upfront about 
their pricing, consumers would have a much easier time finding 
the best deal for them, and businesses that offer the best 
prices and products would thrive.

        RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF CHAIR WARNOCK
                      FROM LINDSEY SIEGEL

Q.1. In your work, what are some common characteristics of the 
populations bad actors are targeting with junk fees?

A.1. At Atlanta Legal Aid, we represent only low-income 
clients. Our low-income tenants are especially vulnerable to 
these bait and switch junk fee schemes. These tenants identify 
potential housing based on advertised rents. They cannot afford 
application fees at multiple complexes so tend to focus their 
applications on one apartment. When they are offered a tenancy, 
they give notice at their existing housing because they cannot 
afford to pay double rent for any period of time. They 
generally do not have an alternative place to go if the 
apartment they have identified and started the leasing process 
on suddenly reveals that it is more expensive than advertised 
because of junk fees. They therefore often have to complete the 
rental because they simply have no other option. The population 
of low-income tenants is especially vulnerable to junk fee 
schemes and is therefore relentlessly targeted. The targeted 
population is also disproportionately people of color and that 
population suffers most from these abuses.

Q.2. Do victims of businesses that utilize predatory fees tend 
to share similar income levels, backgrounds, or education 
levels?

A.2. At Atlanta Legal Aid, we represent only low-income 
clients. We therefore do not have broad experience with all 
income levels. We can certainly say that landlords are 
targeting people with low incomes for these junk fees.
    The tenants most victimized by these junk fee schemes are 
tenants who are least able to afford to pull the plug on a 
rental that reveals itself to be far more expensive than 
initially advertised late in the leasing process. As noted 
above, consumers with low incomes are particularly vulnerable 
to these predatory fees because they do not have the economic 
flexibility to walk away from deceptive schemes.
    Less sophisticated renters are also more likely to be 
subject to these predatory fees. However, our observation is 
that all categories of consumers are vulnerable to the 
deceptive misrepresentation of rental cost facilitated by these 
junk fee schemes. It is often expensive and inconvenient for 
any individual renter to walk away from a rental property they 
have anticipated moving into. Landlords employing these junk 
fee schemes therefor have unfair leverage to extract excessive 
rents from consumers. The harm of these excessive rents is felt 
more strongly by people with low incomes who have less ability 
to absorb concealed costs.

Q.3. How does the imposition of junk fees affect overall 
economic participation among low- and middle-income consumers? 
What is its effect on socioeconomic mobility?

A.3. Economic participation among low income consumers involves 
their personal spending and their employment. Both of these 
activities are disrupted, often severely, by the bait and 
switch effect of junk fees.
    As noted above, unplanned additional spending on housing 
expenses unfairly elevates rents and means consumers have less 
money to spend on other needs. This artificially shifts 
spending to unscrupulous landlords and away from all other 
sectors of the economy. The victims of these schemes have less 
money to spend on food, medicine, clothing, transportation to 
work, doctor's visits, or internet that their children need to 
complete school assignments. They will forgo other basic needs 
to avoid becoming homeless. They also have even less 
opportunity to accumulate wealth for long term needs such as 
saving to purchase a car, home or higher education.
    Potentially even more devastating to low- and middle-income 
consumers' economic participation are the cases where the 
unfair excess charges from junk fees lead to a need to relocate 
or an eviction. First, this usually imposes an additional large 
cost on the tenant and further depresses their ability to spend 
on other needs. Second, having to relocate in midlease or 
unexpectedly can also make it impossible to work for a period 
of time and may cause job loss. Job loss can lead to other 
catastrophic results. The unanticipated and unfair expense 
created by junk fees can lead to a spiral of economic problems.
    The unfair costs imposed by junk fees at a minimum cause 
extra expenditures directed toward rent. Because many middle- 
and low-income consumers have a precarious balance of income 
and expenditures, these extra charges can cause catastrophic 
results for some consumers including moving, evictions, and 
loss of job with devastating effects on economic participation. 
All these effects negatively affect socioeconomic mobility of 
these consumers.
