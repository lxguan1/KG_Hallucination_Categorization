STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS J. VILSACK, SECRETARY
ACCOMPANIED BY:
        MR. JOHN RAPP, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF BUDGET AND PROGRAM ANALYSIS


              opening statement of senator martin heinrich


    Senator Heinrich. Good morning. This hearing of the 
Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee is now called to order.
    And I would like to start by welcoming Secretary Vilsack. 
Joining the Secretary is Mr. John Rapp, Budget Director for the 
Department of Agriculture. And we welcome both of you here 
today.
    This is my first hearing as chairman of this subcommittee, 
and I am looking forward to a good discussion on the fiscal 
year 2024 Budget Request for the Department of Agriculture.
    The programs and activities of this Department affect every 
single American, from farmers, and rural communities, to 
children and families who depend on healthy and nutritious 
food.
    This subcommittee must ensure that USDA has the resources 
you need to fulfill your broad and absolutely critical mission. 
The budget request for United States Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) is ambitious, and it includes significant increases 
across the board. The request totals $24.5 billion, which is an 
increase of $2 billion.
    I am pleased that the budget focuses on providing tools to 
producers in rural communities to address the climate crisis, 
and it calls for coordination of climate solutions across the 
entire Department. I look forward to discussing some of these 
initiatives and how this subcommittee can play a role in this 
critical issue.
    We also know that affordable housing is a major challenge, 
not just in my home State of New Mexico, but really across the 
Nation, and particularly in rural areas. The budget includes 
much needed increases and innovative policy proposals to grow, 
our affordable housing stock in rural communities, and ensure 
that all Americans can access a safe and affordable place to 
call home.
    Another issue of great importance to both of us is ensuring 
that our children can receive healthy and nutritious food, 
without this our children simply do not learn as effectively; 
do not thrive, so I am pleased to see increases to vital 
nutrition programs.
    It is clear that USDA has much work to do. And I look 
forward to a robust discussion today. I am looking forward to 
starting the appropriations process and working with all the 
members of this subcommittee to draft an Agriculture Bill that 
supports these vital programs.
    I want to briefly reiterate the importance of reaching a 
bipartisan top line agreement. We must invest in nondefense 
programs if we want to move this country forward. We have 
important work to do, and we need to come together to bring 
back regular order. That will not be easy, but I stand ready to 
work with every member as we continue to move this process 
forward.
    And with that, I will turn to our ranking member, Ranking 
Member Hoeven, for any statement that he may have. And I would 
just quickly add that I am looking forward to working with you, 
and continuing the bipartisan tradition of this subcommittee.


                    statement of senator john hoeven


    Senator Hoeven. Thanks Chairman Heinrich. Appreciate it. I 
look forward to working with you as well.
    Welcome back, Secretary Vilsack. I appreciate you being 
here. We saw you on the Hill here a week or so ago, and 
appreciate your diligence, and certainly respect your knowledge 
of the Department of Agriculture having, you know, served 8 
years prior, and back in the role. And of course I have had 
opportunity to work with you through the years both in that 
role and as governors.
    The Department of Agriculture (Ag) affects every American 
every day, our farmers and ranchers produce the highest 
quality, low-cost food supply in the world that benefits every 
single American, every single day. So what you do is incredibly 
important, what we do here in Ag Appropriations is incredibly 
important. And of course writing a good Farm Bill this year is 
incredibly important.
    There are always challenges, we have seen that, obviously, 
with trade relations, with Coronavirus (COVID), with weather, 
the supply chain issues, energy costs, all those things, are 
challenges that our farmers and ranchers face every day, and 
that is why it is so, so important that we have a good farm 
policy.
    Because when you look at our AG industry I think it is 
absolutely remarkable. It is a remarkable industry where we 
have been able to maintain a network of small businesses across 
this country, unlike so many other industries where you have 
seen incredible concentration, but we have got those small 
businesses, family farms, and ranches, in many cases that have 
been operating for, you know, decades and generations of 
families. And we can't take that for granted.
    Like I said, benefits every American because of this system 
we have, and we can't treat it like when we walk in the room 
and flip on the light that it is always going to be there for 
us just the way it is. So I think it is incredibly important we 
keep that in mind as we craft farm policy. And I know, 
Secretary, you do.
    This subcommittee has provided substantial support for our 
farmers, ranchers, producers, and rural communities. Last year, 
we provided critical base funding increase of 4 percent for 
USDA research programs, 2.7 percent for Rural Development 
programs, 5.6 for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS).
    And you know, programs like that, again, are so important. 
I think sometimes people don't even realize they are out there. 
But we keep them healthy because of those inspection services 
that make sure that that food gets to people and they can count 
on it being, you know, healthy, and free of disease, and other 
problems.
    Again, things that, you know, the consumer takes for 
granted. But food doesn't come just from the grocery store, it 
comes from the farm and ranch, and there is a lot that goes 
into making all that happen.
    At the same time as we have provided more funds for these 
programs, we have got to be careful because of the cost of the 
overall farm program, the Farm Bill in total, the Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), all the different 
components that go into this outstanding network of farming, 
and ranching, and food supply that we have, we have got to 
recognize that we have a real problem, overall, with the 
budget, and we have got to be part of helping find solutions 
that work. That has got to be an important part of what we do.
    What I would submit to you, and I will be intrigued to hear 
your comments on it, Secretary, when we get into the Q&A, is 
that by doing a good job on crop insurance and the 
countercyclical safety net, we make sure those farmers can 
produce more food of the highest quality, with incredible 
variety that keeps the food costs for the consumer as one of 
the lowest percentage of their budgets of any country in the 
world.
    That is not only important to every American every day, but 
when we look at the nutrition programs, it reduces the cost of 
those nutrition programs, because more supply not only means, 
you know, more availability of food, but lower costs.
    So getting crop insurance and that safety net right 
benefits every aspect of what we do, and it is critically 
important, not only for this appropriations process, but as we 
go into writing the Farm Bill.
    Again, Chairman, thank you; I look forward to working with 
you.
    And Secretary, thanks for joining us today.
    Senator Heinrich. Mr. Secretary.


              summary statement of hon. thomas j. vilsack


    Secretary Vilsack. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for 
the opportunity; and Senator Hoeven, thank you for the 
opportunity, to appear before the committee today. And to the 
Members of Committee, thank you for this opportunity.
    This is an unusual budget, perhaps one that you have never 
faced before, because you have to put it in the context of 
everything else that is surrounding the Department of 
Agriculture today. Whether it is the investments that are being 
made in the American Rescue Plan (ARP), or the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law (BIL), or the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), 
these are resources that complement and supplement, if you 
will, the budget that we are presenting to you.
    And the goal of this budget, frankly, is to invest in a 
stronger America, and to expand our middle class, as the 
President likes to say, from the bottom up and the middle out. 
And there is no better opportunity to do that than within the 
agricultural budget.
    I would make one observation and one request of this 
committee, that you take a look at the percentage increases of 
this committee over time, and compare it to the percentage 
increases of other Departments of Government. I think what you 
are going to find, even in the nondiscretionary--nondefense 
discretionary budget, the increases in this Department's budget 
have been modest compared to other agencies.
    So as you look at choices that have to be made, I hope that 
that factor is taken into consideration, given the importance 
of this Department, and the work of this Department, as both 
the Chair and the Ranking Member have indicated.
    When we look at making a stronger America and expanding the 
middle class, there are things like the investments that we are 
proposing in research surrounding clean energy and climate that 
will help to create that middle class. Whether it is developing 
a new industry, sustainable aviation fuel, or other bio-based 
products, the idea here is to create not just better energy 
sources, but also income sources for our farmers.
    As Senator Hoeven knows, having listened to this before 
during the Farm Bill Hearing at the Senate Ag Committee, that 
we have had a record year in farm income in the last 2 years; 
however, that that bounty has not been fully shared by all 
farmers, nearly 50 percent of farmers during those record years 
did not make any money, another 40 percent, or so, made money, 
but the majority of money they made came from off-farm income.
    So we had some farmers, those who sell more than $1,000,000 
in product do very, very well in this economy, but I think we 
still have a job to do for the other 90 percent. So investments 
in research that create new opportunities; new income 
opportunities, is a way of maintaining those small- and mid-
sized farming operations.
    We are asking for increases in investment and staff at 
Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Why? Because we 
want to provide more technical assistance to farmers who are 
embracing climate-smart practices, and we know that when they 
do they can qualify for ecosystem service market opportunities, 
which create another revenue source that is not currently 
available to many farmers.
    It is not just about asking for more money, it is also 
about asking for legislative changes. We would like to be able 
to open up more credit opportunities for beginning farmers. We 
would like to take a look at the time and the number of times 
farmers can come back to the Farm Service Agency (FSA) for 
assistance and help so they can stay on the farm, extending the 
number of years that they can borrow from the USDA.
    It is proposed legislative changes in the Rural Development 
to preserve rental assistance, we are facing a circumstance in 
situation where a number of rental units could be lost as 
mortgages get paid off, rental assistance units are lost, the 
amount of vouchers that we provided, basically, take care of 
about 35 projects each year. The circumstances today are that 
we are losing about 80 projects per year. So we are losing 
literally, potentially, tens of thousands of rental assistance 
units in rural America at a time when we need affordable 
housing.
    It is protecting farmers from unfair practices in the 
marketplace, which is why we are asking for continued support 
for our packers and stockyards. There is a competing view, 
obviously, to this budget that we have proposed. And that 
competing view has suggested significant reductions across the 
board, and I wanted you all to have an understanding of the 
degree to which those budget cuts would impact and affect this 
Department.
    If those budget cuts, even the most conservative budget 
cut, that is to say, putting it back to levels of several years 
ago, would result, not in an increase in Special Supplemental 
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) 
participation, but perhaps as many as 250,000 participants in 
WIC not being able to be provided that opportunity.
    It would likely mean a loss of 40,000 rental assistance 
units in rural America. It would mean 84,000 farmers couldn't 
access the technical assistance they need to embrace 
conservation practices. It would mean 6,600 farmers wouldn't 
get the credit they need to continue farming operations. There 
are real impacts to these reductions.
    So that is the reason why I am here today, is to talk to 
the committee about the importance of this Department's budget 
relative to all other budgets, and to basically make the case 
that in the context of what we are trying to do to create new 
opportunities for farmers, new income sources for farmers 
which, in turn, will create more job opportunities as well, in 
rural America, and create a revival of the economy, this budget 
is at a critical point, at a transformational point, in my 
view, in rural America, and in agriculture.
    And I look forward to the opportunity to respond to any 
questions that the committee may have.
    [The statement follows:]

              Prepared Statement of Hon. Thomas J. Vilsack
    Thank you, Chair Heinrich, Ranking Member Hoeven, and distinguished 
members of this subcommittee, for the opportunity to come before you 
today to discuss the Administration's priorities for the Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) and to provide you an overview of the 2024 
President's Budget.
    We are at a pivotal moment for American agriculture and rural 
communities with a decision to make about if, and how, agriculture will 
meet the challenges of our time. One option is to maintain the status 
quo. This path leads towards even more producers struggling to cover 
their costs and often turning to off-farm income to support their 
families; it leads to far too many rural communities languishing and 
demonstrates the outdatedness of agricultural policies designed to 
address challenges of the 1930s and 1970s, ones that reinforce systemic 
inequities. This path works for a few who have done what American 
agricultural economics has required of them: get big or get out. But 
there is another path, one that prompts us to recognize the undeniable 
challenges of climate change, the need for greater equity in our food 
system, and that there are opportunities to seize as we seek to adapt 
to a new course. This path draws on lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, 
which exposed vulnerabilities at every point in our food supply chain--
from the field to the factory to the grocery store--and compels us to 
take transformative action so that this vital system is more resilient, 
secure, and accessible to all. This path also draws strength from the 
Interim Recommendations of the USDA Equity Commission \1\, because they 
are a roadmap for ensuring USDA lives up to its name as the People's 
Department for everyone. There is nothing more foundational to a 
country's security and stability than its food supply; an inclusive 
agriculture and rural life must be part of a shift to a bottom-up, 
middle-out system if we want to create more opportunity in this 
country.

equity for all. https://www.usda.gov/equity-commission/reports
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Through the fiscal Year 2024 Budget, the Biden-Harris 
Administration and USDA have embraced a path where the future of 
American agriculture is secure and where there is greater equity and 
economic opportunity for agricultural and rural communities.
    The 2024 USDA President's Budget also recognizes the historic 
investments that Congress has made through the American Rescue Plan, 
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction 
Act. USDA is delivering on these investments, and the 2024 Budget 
continues to confront challenges, rebuild the rural economy, and 
support a new, innovative approach to the future of agriculture. 
Agriculture is the foundation for fuel, fiber, and food; the 
agricultural economy is more than just growing crops and selling them, 
or raising livestock and selling them, or the products from them. The 
food and agriculture industry contributes nearly $8 trillion to the 
global economy, about a fifth of the economic activity of our country. 
A strong agriculture sector is key to strong rural communities, 
supporting over 21 million people and 11 percent of jobs in the 
economy, providing access to essential services like housing, health 
facilities, and fast reliable internet; it's how we ensure there's 
safe, nutritious, affordable food on the table for everyone, supporting 
the more than 10.2 percent of Americans that experience food insecurity 
\2\; it's how we support and protect forests, grasslands, and farms--
nearly 50 percent of this nation's total land mass; and it's how we 
provide for the communities that depend on them. The proposals in this 
budget will address these challenges and spur new job creation and 
opportunities in rural America; build resilience in the food supply 
chain and restore America's advantage in agriculture; leverage USDA's 
expertise to address climate change; and support a stronger nutrition 
safety net. To make demonstrable progress toward addressing these real 
issues, the 2024 President's Budget proposes $213.2 billion for USDA 
programs, of which approximately $180.6 billion is mandatory funding 
and $32.6 billion is discretionary funding.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        research and innovation
    This pivotal moment calls for additional investment in research and 
innovation that influence every program we implement at USDA. 
Agricultural research has a return on investment of $17 for every $1 
invested. Between 1948 and 2019, total agricultural output in the 
United States grew by 142 percent. This rise was not due to increases 
in agricultural land or labor; in fact, both inputs declined over the 
period. The productivity stemmed from the adoption of a whole suite of 
innovations and technology transfer in crop and livestock breeding, 
nutrient use, pest management, farm practices, and farm equipment and 
structures. These innovations are the fruits of publicly funded 
agricultural R&D that often have a less-told story, but we live and 
reap the benefits of these investments every single day. Production 
agriculture requires constant innovation and adaptation as farmers and 
ranchers pursue climate-smart solutions to extreme weather, rural 
businesses seek new markets, and underserved communities seek trusted 
partners to tackle systemic concerns.
    The budget proposes a $4.2 billion investment in our research, 
education, and economics programs. The budget includes discretionary 
funding of $1.9 billion for the National Institute of Food and 
Agriculture (NIFA) of which $550 million is for the Agriculture and 
Food Research Initiative (AFRI). Demand for AFRI's competitive funds 
grows annually and the awards focus on promoting enhanced profitability 
and productivity in U.S. agriculture, food and nutrition security, and 
boosting rural prosperity through a circular economy with support for 
clean energy technologies, climate-smart agriculture and forestry, and 
education and workforce development. An additional $2 billion for the 
Agricultural Research Service (ARS) includes increases of $20 million 
in support of the Cancer Moonshot, $13 million for the operations and 
maintenance of the new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, $83 
million for clean energy, $88.5 million for climate science, $10 
million for Climate Hubs and Climate Hub Fellows, and $14 million for 
additional high priority investments. These funds enable ARS to find 
solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from 
field to table. This is done through the delivery of cutting-edge, 
scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, 
producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and 
well-being of all people; sustain our Nation's agroecosystems and 
natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and 
excellence of our agriculture.
    Science and research are the best defenses we have to protect our 
resources against the climate crisis. The changes in our environment 
have allowed invasive plants, pests, and diseases to move around the 
world more easily and become established in new areas. Without the 
tools and sufficient resources to protect ourselves against invasive 
species and safeguard the health, welfare, and value of American 
agriculture and natural resources, our farmers and our economy will 
suffer. The budget calls for an investment of $6 million for the 
Civilian Climate Corps within our Animal Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS) to identifying emerging invasive species threats and 
expand efforts to develop and implement new surveillance methods to 
detect incursions of invasive pests more quickly as well as develop new 
mitigation methods to address those already present causing economic 
and environmental damages.
                      tackling the climate crisis
    Producers and land managers across the country are experiencing 
real and increasing threats from climate change that have serious 
implications-not just for farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners- but 
also for surrounding communities and all Americans. In 2022, nearly 80 
percent of the western region experienced extreme drought, wildfires 
burned over 7.6 million acres of our forestland, and communities across 
the country are dealing with the impacts of severe flooding and record 
snow fall exacerbated by climate change. Agriculture has a critical 
role in delivering climate change solutions and our Nations farmers, 
ranchers, and foresters are already leading the way through the 
adoption of voluntary and farmer friendly incentive-based climate-smart 
agricultural and forestry practices. The budget proposes over $7 
billion across the department in finding solutions to the climate 
crisis through science, clean energy innovation, minimizing emissions 
and greenhouse gases, building resilience, and supporting farmers and 
producers as they adapt to the changing environment. Farmers, ranchers, 
and forest landowners are ready, but they need USDA resources to help 
mitigate their risk as they adopt these solutions.
    The budget includes $904 million for Conservation Operations to 
work with landowners and managers to develop conservation plans that 
outline the specific practices needed to improve farm operations and 
enhance farm environmental sustainability. The request includes an 
increase of $23 million for Climate Smart Agriculture Implementation to 
improve greenhouse gas monitoring, establish a soil health monitoring 
network, and better understand the interrelationship between 
conservation planning, practice implementation, and adaptation and 
resilience to climate change. The budget proposes to enhance the 
Conservation Technical Assistance Equity Conservation Cooperative 
Agreements, begun in 2021, with an additional $50 million, bringing 
total funding for this initiative to $100 million. The agreements are 
2-year projects that expand the delivery of conservation assistance for 
climate-smart agriculture and forestry to farmers and ranchers who are 
beginning, limited resource, historically underserved and/or veterans. 
The budget also proposes $20 million for the Healthy Forests Reserve 
Program to enroll private lands and acreage owned by Indian Tribes for 
the purpose of restoring, enhancing, and protecting forestland to 
enhance carbon sequestration, improve plant and animal biodiversity, 
and promote recovery of endangered and threatened species under the 
Endangered Species Act. These efforts will allow for important outreach 
and promotion of inclusive outcomes in farming practices, addressing 
some of the historical inequities and working to build new levels of 
trust with the People's Department.
    The budget supports climate resiliency in a myriad of other ways 
because the approach to the addressing the climate crisis must be taken 
on multiple fronts. For example, USDA proposes to permanently authorize 
the pandemic Cover Crop Incentive Program and apply the successful 
model implemented with supplemental funding that provides a $5 per acre 
premium subsidy for acres planted with cover crop. Cover cropping 
systems benefit the environment by reducing soil erosion and 
compaction, increase soil organic matter, and limit nutrient runoff. 
Given the demand for this program in 2021 and 2022, USDA estimates a 
15-million-acre enrollment in 2024 and that the program will grow 5 
percent annually.
    The budget provides $255 million in new funding to support clean 
energy innovation, which includes an additional $155 million for 
emissions mitigation deployment to help meet the Administration's goal 
of zero carbon electricity by 2035. Specifically, grants and loans will 
be used to expand rural clean energy, transform rural power production, 
and create jobs. The budget requests an additional $30 million in 
annual grant funding for the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) 
and will assist agricultural producers and rural small businesses to 
purchase or install renewable energy systems or make energy efficiency 
improvements. These increases will build tens of thousands of new 
renewable energy systems and support small business owners in every 
State.
                    creating more and better markets
    While our policies and programs have ensured an increasingly 
abundant food supply, growth in farm size and consolidation has put 
extreme economic pressure on small and medium sized farms and our rural 
communities. Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine, have roiled the supply chain, and exacerbated the 
impacts of climate change, droughts, wildfires, other natural 
disasters, and an especially widespread highly pathogenic avian 
influenza (HPAI) outbreak. American agriculture has proven itself to be 
extraordinarily efficient, but these crises have further revealed 
hidden weaknesses in our production-optimized system. The challenges 
presented today to our farms and rural communities requires a whole 
systems approach to stay competitive and innovate the food and 
agricultural system so that it works for everyone. In recent history, 
there have been record setting farm income levels, but noting 
approximately 80 percent of the value of agricultural production is 
produced on farms that are midsized or larger. But nearly 50 percent of 
our farmers have had negative farm income. Our data shows that 40 
percent of farms are small and midsize farms where the primary 
occupation of the household is farming, but most of their income that 
was supporting their families came from off-farm sources. It's obvious 
that the system needs to be revisited to find a way that the system 
benefits the small and medium farms, expands opportunity, and values 
their products. USDA currently has 141 Partnerships for Climate Smart 
Commodities projects that are helping to make it less risky for farmers 
to embrace climate-smart practices and link them to new markets that 
value and reward them for their commitment to sustainability. These 
opportunities for our farmers need Congress' support to build the 
markets and show value to their customers.
    The budget requests $80 million to support new supply chains and 
markets that uplift small and mid-sized farmers through programs such 
as the Local Agriculture Market Program, Dairy Business Innovation, 
Farmers Market and Local Food Production, and Transportation and Market 
Development. USDA is also expanding local food systems through urban 
agriculture, supporting communities' capacity to gather, process, move 
and store food in different geographic areas of the country. Urban 
agriculture provides more options for producers to create value-added 
products and sell locally to create new economic opportunities and job 
creation in underserved communities. In 2024, USDA will invest over 
$157 million in urban agriculture and innovation production initiatives 
across the department, of which $13.5 million will go towards the Urban 
Agriculture and Innovative Production Program, creating more grant 
opportunities with a priority on supporting historically underserved 
communities.
                        rebuilding rural america
    It has been said that Rural Development can build a town from the 
ground up. The essence of that statement is that USDA Rural 
Development, when well-resourced and well-staffed, provides support 
that is critical to improving quality of life in rural America--whether 
it is through more affordable housing in underserved communities, 
increased access to broadband service, or resilient wastewater 
infrastructure. These are problems we can and must solve, and USDA is 
committed to ensuring rural America has equitable access to essential 
resources. To do so, we must have sufficient Rural Development staff to 
deliver these vital programs. Over the last decade, RD's portfolio has 
increased 85 percent, but its staffing levels decreased by 30 percent. 
Increased staffing resources are desperately needed to ensure that we 
meet the growing priorities in critical areas that have a direct effect 
on our ability to be sustainable, relevant, and results- oriented in 
delivering much-needed programs and services across rural America. The 
budget proposal increases funding for Rural Development by $801 million 
and includes critical increases for combatting climate change, and 
improvements to rural communities' quality of life; these investments 
attract new businesses, create greater sense of pride in communities, 
and allow rural America to prosper.
    In 2022 alone, USDA provided $548 million to the ReConnect program 
and expanded access for 109,000 households, 14,520 farms, 5,900 
businesses, 435 essential community facilities, 396 educational 
facilities, and 51 health care facilities. The fiscal Year 2024 Budget 
requests $400 million to reach even more communities, homes, and 
businesses with reliable internet access which builds upon the $2 
billion of funding provided by Congress in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law so that every community in America has access to 
affordable, high-speed Internet.
    It's estimated that 2.2 million people in America still lack indoor 
plumbing and around 10 million homes still have poisonous lead pipes. 
The President's Budget proposes $2.38 billion in the Water and 
Wastewater program to provide additional grants and loans that will 
improve water and waste disposal systems in rural areas and provide for 
lead pipe replacement. This is an increase of $324 million over the 
2023 enacted level and is a key investment in safe drinking water and 
sanitary waste disposal systems, which are vital to achieving a high 
quality of life for rural residents. Specifically, the budget provides 
$1.6 billion in direct loans and $872 million in BA for water and 
wastewater grants and loan subsidy. Within this funding, the Budget 
targets $100M in grants for lead pipe replacement. In addition, the 
Budget includes an increased loan level of $110 million for the 1 
percent loan risk category, that targets the most rural and poor 
communities.
    Affordable housing has been a long-standing problem for low-income 
residents in rural communities, one that is exacerbated by low energy 
efficiency of the aging housing stock which means higher costs to 
families. To help address this, the Budget includes a new proposal to 
eliminate the existing low-income borrower penalty that requires 
individuals to repay subsidy costs for Single-Family Direct loans-a 
requirement that only exists for rural housing. Ending the 
``recapture'' penalty promotes equity in rural communities, with 
particular attention to those suffering from systemic racism and other 
forms of discrimination. In addition, the budget includes the authority 
to decouple rental assistance from USDA financed properties to help 
ensure low- income rural tenants in USDA financed properties continue 
to have access to affordable rents when projects reach loan maturity 
and leave the portfolio. This proposal would allow vouchers when we 
lose rental assisted properties, but these would be processed by HUD to 
ensure that USDA is not funding vouchers that can leave rural areas. 
The Budget also continues the 2023 Budget proposal to require climate 
smart construction in USDA's rural housing programs. There are also 
several new legislative changes designed to improve the disposal of 
Real Estate Owned (REO) properties in shorter time frames and reduce 
the costs associated with maintaining REO for longer periods; and 
provide authority to standardize multifamily housing foreclosures 
across States. The funding in the budget for these housing programs is 
$2.2 billion, an increase of $459 million over 2023 Enacted.
    To ensure that all rural communities are made aware of and are 
encouraged to participate in USDA programs, this budget proposes $32 
million to sustain and expand the Rural Partners Network (RPN) 
authority. RPN provides targeted training, technical assistance, and 
outreach to distressed communities in rural America through an all-of-
government approach to help rural and Tribal communities access Federal 
funding and resources. This support is allowing for more strategic 
community engagement, facilitating regional coordination among Federal 
agencies to share best practices, braid Federal resources, and foster 
collaboration with local and State partners. This work follows through 
a commitment the President made when he came to office--we must invest 
in America's heartland in a meaningful way. It is critical that we 
ensure that our rural and Tribal communities can benefit from Federal 
investments as the Biden-Harris Administration delivers unprecedented 
resources through the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law, and Inflation Reduction Act. We can only expand this innovative 
work of RPN into more rural communities and additional States if 
Congress builds on the progress made over the last year and provides 
additional funding for RPN.
                  supporting nutrition for the nation
    USDA's core nutrition programs are the most far-reaching, powerful 
tools available that ensure all Americans, regardless of race, 
ethnicity, or background, have access to healthy, affordable food. 
Across America, one in four individuals is served by one of USDA's 16 
nutrition assistance programs over the course of the year. The budget 
makes strategic investments to advance nutrition security through 
education and evidence-based interventions, and to support the purchase 
of nutritious and local foods.
    We know that the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, 
Infants, and Children (WIC) drives better health for infants and more 
nutritious diets for children, and it is a key tool for addressing 
disparities in maternal and child health outcomes. WIC serves about 
half of all babies in the United States. After many years of decreasing 
participation, WIC participation is now rising across all eligible 
categories--women, children and infants. Continuing the bipartisan 
commitment to full funding, the Budget requests $6.3 billion for WIC to 
serve an estimated 6.5 million moms, infants, and young children per 
month in 2024. It also proposes to continue the enhanced Cash Value 
Benefits through 2024 to provide participants with increased benefits 
to buy fresh fruits and vegetables which ensures that participating 
women and children have access to scientific-based recommended levels 
of fruits and vegetables.
    The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) stretches the 
food budget for many low- income people and research shows that 
participation in SNAP reduces food insecurity and allows families to 
have healthier diets. The budget request $122.1 billion for SNAP, a $32 
billion decrease from 2023 primarily due to the expiration of emergency 
allotment payments that were provided during fiscal years 2020 through 
2022 and the 1.3 million participant decrease projected in enrollment 
because of a recovering economy. As SNAP monthly benefits decline, USDA 
anticipates that more eligible Tribal members will choose to 
participate in the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations 
(FDPIR) over SNAP, as it provides food packages to Indian Tribal 
Organizations to improve nutrition and provide culturally appropriate 
sustenance. The budget requests $165 million in 2024 to fund FDPIR food 
and administrative costs, which supports participation at pre-pandemic 
levels.
    Child nutrition programs, such as the National School Lunch 
Program, School Breakfast Program, Summer Food Service Program, and 
Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, play a crucial role in ensuring that 
children receive nutritious meals and snacks that promote health and 
educational readiness. The meals children receive prepare them for 
learning, foster healthy eating habits, and safeguard their health with 
a goal of reducing the number of overweight and obese children. Thanks 
to the 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, a series of landmark 
expansions for Child Nutrition Programs are now permanent. This 
includes establishing a permanent Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer 
Program for Children (Summer EBT) and adding a rural non-congregate 
option in the Summer Food Service Program. Thanks to these changes by 
Congress we know that we will see a permanent and positive impact on 
how we meet the nutritional needs of children during the summer, 
greatly improving equitable access to safe, healthy, and nutritious 
food. The 2024 budget request expands on those important expansions of 
child nutrition with a legislative proposal that would advance a 
pathway to free school meals for an additional 9 million school 
children through increased take up of the Community Eligibility 
Provision among schools and States. This proposal is expected to cost 
$234 million in 2024 and $15 billion over 10 years. During the COVID-19 
pandemic, children had access to free meals resulting from temporary 
flexibilities provided in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, 
and now many States are seeking ways to continue offering free school 
meals for all students. Offering free meals to all children reduces 
administrative burden, increases equitable access, reduces the stigma 
associated with school meal participation, and allows schools to focus 
on providing the highest quality meals.
    The budget funds the child nutrition programs at a level that will 
allow for the anticipated increases in participation, food cost 
inflation, and implementation of new legislation. The budget projects 
serving 5 billion lunches and snacks and 2.6 billion breakfasts in 
schools, 1.9 billion meals in child and adult care programs, and 182 
million meals through the Summer Food Service Program. The increases 
will strengthen integrity controls, modernize food ordering and 
inventory management systems, and provide critical staffing to enhance 
FNS's ability to provide technical assistance and oversight of child 
nutrition programs.
        rebuilding usda through diversity, equity, and inclusion
    Building a better USDA means bringing people of all backgrounds and 
lived experiences to be a part of a healthy, safe, and inclusive 
workplace. This includes ensuring we are recruiting the best and the 
brightest across our great country, and investing in our employees 
through recognition, wellness programs, and support to our employees. 
Building a better America is about ensuring all have equal access to 
USDA opportunities, which demands that we design and implement our 
policies and programs with our diverse customers at the center. The 
2024 budget focuses on building a USDA that is a model employer and 
great place to work, proposes investments that remove barriers to 
accessing USDA programs, and addresses historic gaps with respect to 
who benefits from USDA programming.
    It's an honor and a privilege to have the dedicated and talented 
staff of over 100,000 employees supporting USDA. However, the historic 
lack of investment throughout the Department over the years has 
resulted in a decline in staffing that we still struggle to recover 
from and has meant that we have not had the necessary resources to 
modernize critical IT systems or make other improvements to the way we 
do business here in USDA in support of rural Americans. Rebuilding our 
workplace and workforce right will take time and focus over the course 
of multiple years, but it couldn't be more important. In addition to 
the programs that the public relies on and subcommittee and Congress 
generously fund, I implore you to also concentrate on the critical 
needs of organizational abilities and operations management that ensure 
our staff are properly supported and our programs are delivered 
efficiently, effectively, and with integrity.
    There is currently 13 percent of the USDA workforce that is 
eligible for retirement and in the next 4 years, another 13 percent 
will become eligible for retirement. We need to focus on the future of 
agriculture when rebuilding our workplace. Our workplace needs to 
remain competitive, and the future of agriculture needs to reflect the 
diversity across America and fight against historic inequities. USDA is 
fostering collaboration between State, federal, and Tribal partners, 
land-grant universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, Tribal 
colleges, historically black colleges and universities, and other 
strategic partners, to connect USDA programs and opportunities with the 
communities they are intended to serve. Within this budget request, 
over $370 million is dedicated to 1890 historically black land-grant 
colleges and universities, 1994 Tribal land grant colleges and 
universities, and Hispanic-serving institutions. These partnerships 
with minority serving institutions support capacity building 
initiatives that bolster education and pathways to employment for 
students and faculty and help develop a strong pipeline of talented 
individuals for USDA and USDA partner jobs. These investments in future 
agricultural leaders will help USDA attract the best and brightest to 
face the growing challenges of the agricultural economy.
                               conclusion
    This budget is not a wish list; rather, it is a to do list to 
fulfill the items that Congress and USDA have been talking about fixing 
for decades. Moreover, this budget seeks to build the foundation for 
innovation during this pivotal moment. It gives USDA the set of tools 
to add to existing capabilities and develop new ways to address the 
urgent challenges of our time-rebuild from the pandemic, respond to the 
nutrition insecurity crisis, address the impacts of climate change, 
invest in research and innovation, strengthen and build new markets and 
opportunities for farmers and producers, rebuild the rural economy that 
benefits all Americans, and ensure our services and programs are 
accessible to everyone. It is a plan for what we need to do to continue 
to get USDA back on track and to help the U.S. outcompete the rest of 
the world. USDA needs the support of this subcommittee and of Congress 
to make the much-needed investments called for in the President's 
fiscal year 2024 Budget. I look forward to working with this 
subcommittee and to answering any questions you may have about our 
budget proposals.

    Senator Heinrich. Thank you for that opening statement, 
Secretary. We will start with five-minute rounds, or seven-
minute rounds of questions, I guess. Are we doing five or 
seven? It keeps changing in front of me, sorry. We will just 
get into the questions. How about that?
    USDA programs are just playing an absolutely indispensable 
role in the recovery from the Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon Fire in 
New Mexico. The Emergency Watershed Protection Program, the 
Emergency Forest Restoration Program, the Emergency 
Conservation Programs are lifelines for families who are 
working to get their properties back in condition, timberland 
back in working condition, ranches, et cetera.
    At the end of last year we passed nearly $1 billion dollars 
in supplemental funding for these USDA emergency programs. And 
I was just hoping you could give me a little bit of a progress 
update on how you feel the implementation is going?
    Secretary Vilsack. I am pleased with the fact that Chief 
Cosby at NRCS has allocated $133 million from the conservation 
programs, in a direct effort to try to address the nine 
projects that are of significance and importance. And obviously 
the Forest Service has been quite diligent in making sure that 
resources are being provided to communities.
    So I think the effort is underway. There is still more work 
to be done, for sure. We are not going to forget about this, we 
know we have an obligation to folks. I would say that I was 
pleased with the opportunity that the Governor provided for us 
to have kind of a--the equivalent of a job fair in New Mexico, 
where we basically brought all of the various departments, for 
all of the various entities, together in a gymnasium, and 
basically gave people an opportunity to apply for various 
programs.
    So if there is something more that we need to do, 
obviously, Mr. Chairman, I am more than happy to hear from you, 
and from your staff, but we have certainly focused on this, and 
understand the importance of it.
    Senator Heinrich. I think it is important for people to 
realize that these are not one-time emergencies. Because you 
have the emergency, and in this case that fire lasted a really 
long time people were out of their homes. And then you have the 
floods that come afterwards.
    Every year we have, you know, about half of our 
precipitation in the late summer in what we call, the monsoon 
season, and then you are just right back in emergency 
situations once again. And so the coordination between all the 
departments that are really helping with this recovery is much 
appreciated, and we will continue that dialogue.

                        CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE

    Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is an issue of particular 
importance to both the Ranking Member and myself. We passed 
some new authorities last year with the Chronic Wasting Disease 
and Research Management Act. As you know, CWD is a fatal 
disease that affects deer, elk, and moose.
    Secretary, could you provide just a little bit of an update 
on the Department's implementation of this legislation?
    Secretary Vilsack. We are using the resources that you all 
have provided, and the direction you have provided to enter 
into cooperative agreements with states and tribes, in an 
effort to try to focus on both wild and domestic herds. 
Basically, we are splitting the resources between those two, I 
think it is important.
    We also are looking at the role of research trying to 
determine exactly that--how this is transmitted from wild to 
domestic, and domestic to wild, so that we get a better 
understanding and appreciation for what we can do to mitigate 
the consequences of this. And ultimately, potentially 
hopefully, at some point in time, eradicate it, but we are 
working on cooperative agreements right now.
    Senator Heinrich. Do you think the Herd Certification 
Program is working?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, we are in the process of seeking 
public input to make sure that as we implement this, that we do 
it in the right way, and that we do it consistent with what 
people believe the certification program should provide. I 
would say that I would be in a better position to respond to 
your question in a month or two, after we have had that public 
input, and we have given a sense of how to design this program.

                  PRESERVATION OF MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING

    Senator Heinrich. Well, we will circle back on that for 
sure. Rural housing I want to focus on your preservation 
strategy for multi-family rental housing for a moment. For the 
second year, the budget proposes decoupling two really 
important programs financial assistance for affordable housing 
rehabilitation, and construction and project-based rental 
assistance.
    These changes will help maintain and improve access to 
safe, affordable housing for low-income Americans. And I was 
really pleased that the fiscal year 2023 Senate Bill supported 
this crucial policy solution absent this fix. More than 500 
family in New Mexico alone, and 65,000 families across the 
Nation, could lose access to affordable housing over the next 
10 years.
    So Secretary, can you tell us how USDA will implement those 
changes if they are enacted?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, this is obviously a process which 
will require us to go through a rule-making process, Senator, 
but it is really critically important that we get this done. 
Because as I said earlier, we have got a circumstance where 
there are more mortgages getting paid off, as they get paid off 
we lose those rental units unless there is a mechanism for 
continuing them. And we have a voucher program, but the voucher 
program is only providing resources to cover a portion of the 
rental units that are lost.
    And the reality in rural America is those rental units are 
absolutely essential for small towns and communities. They are 
just simply, they are necessary. So unless we decouple, unless 
we figure out ways in which we can encourage reinvestment back 
in these facilities, and continue to provide housing that is 
affordable for folks, we are going to have a serious problem in 
communities, which is why we continue to ask for the 
decoupling, and ask for the assistance in making this happen.
    Senator Heinrich. Yeah. I want to ask you as well, about 
single-family housing recapture, and that proposal around the 
balloon payments. But I am over my time. So I am going to turn 
things over to the Ranking Member.
    And then we will hear from the Chair of the entire 
committee.
    Senator Hoeven. Chairman, our Ranking Member is here, which 
I appreciate very much. So I am going to defer to her for the 
first round, if that is okay.
    Senator Collins. Thank you very much. That is very gracious 
of you, Senator Hoeven.
    I am really pleased to see the leadership of this 
subcommittee, as I know Chair Murray is, because I know that 
you will work very well together.

                       SCHOOL MEALS PROPOSED RULE

    Mr. Secretary, welcome. I very much appreciated your call 
earlier this year to discuss with me, and to preview USDA's 
proposed rule that would significantly change the nutritional 
standards for foods that are served in the school lunch and 
breakfast programs.
    I think we can all agree on the need to have healthy, 
nutritious foods served at school lunches and breakfasts. I 
recently met with the Maine School Nutrition Association, and 
they expressed some concerns about the proposed rule. I have 
forwarded their letter to you, but I want to talk about them 
here today.
    First, let me point out that these are nutrition 
professionals, many of them are registered dietitians, and 
their concern is that students may simply refuse to eat foods 
that have been reformulated to meet the standards in the 
proposed rule. They point out that there are already sodium and 
sugar requirements, and that they are already serving low-
sodium and low-sugar products.
    So they say that with these additional requirements, to 
further lower the sugar and sodium in these foods, that the 
food begins to taste less and less like anything the students 
have ever eaten, and that it will likely end up filling our 
garbage cans.
    Erin Dow, the school nutrition director from Freeport, 
Durham, Maine, summed it up perfectly in our meeting when she 
said, ``An uneaten meal, is not nutritious.''
    My questions to you are this: First, has the Department 
consulted with the frontline school nutrition directors about 
this proposed rule? And second, how will USDA ensure that these 
additional requirements do not result in fewer students eating 
school meals?
    Secretary Vilsack. Those are very good questions, Senator, 
and I appreciate you asking them. First of all, we absolutely 
have reached out to those who are the professionals, those who 
were the heroes during the pandemic, who fed so many children 
and families during the pandemic, and we are certainly 
respectful of the role that they have played, and understand 
the importance of the role they play now.
    For that reason we have reached out to them, and we have 
received input from them, and one of the things we attempted to 
do with these rules was to provide a longer transition period. 
The reality is these requirements don't go into effect 
immediately, they are spaced in over a period of time, which I 
think is important to note, because it gives people an 
opportunity to make those adjustments, it gives the food 
industry an opportunity to make those adjustments.
    I would also point out that many of the reduced sugar 
products that we are talking about, are already in the 
marketplace, they are already available, and in fact they are 
being used in schools today, especially when the adult and 
child care program it is embracing, and with some degree of 
success.
    I would say that we are also providing grants, particularly 
for rural schools, to make it a little bit easier for them to 
respond. And we are understanding that there is a great deal of 
interest in this, and so we are announcing this week a 
transition or an expansion of, rather, an extension of the 
comment period, so we are going to provide additional time for 
people to comment.
    And I would also point out, I am pretty proud of this, that 
we actually made a $10 million award to the Full Plates and 
Full Potential Program in Maine.
    Senator Collins. A great program.
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes. The purpose of that is to provide 
help and assistance. So we are doing a lot in this space, and 
we understand, at the end of the day I think we all as you say, 
we have the same purpose which is to make sure our kids are fed 
well.

                      POLYFLOUORINATED SUBSTANCES

    Senator Collins. Thank you, in my little time remaining, I 
also want to point out that we have had very good discussions 
on Per- and Polyfluorinated Substances (PFAS). I know this is 
of great interest to the Chairman as well, of that class of 
forever chemicals that are being found in our soil, our water, 
our animal feed, our crops, and our livestock.
    In Maine, the presence of PFAS, and wastewater sludge 
spread decades ago as fertilizer is preventing some of our 
family farmers from being able to sell their products, causing 
them significant financial harm, as we have discussed.
    Well, Maine state agencies, agricultural service providers, 
and academic researchers, are already undertaking research 
relevant to the presence of PFAS, and the agricultural 
landscape. Far more research is needed. I noticed in the budget 
that this year your Department is requesting $20 million for 
PFAS-related activities? How do you propose to use these funds? 
And more broadly, what role do you see, for the Department, in 
supporting research relevant to the PFAS challenge?
    Secretary Vilsack. We needed to have a better 
understanding, Senator, of the full extent of this challenge 
that we face, and a better understanding of the impact of PFAS, 
when it is found in soil, when it is found in anything that 
impacts and affects our food supply. So first and foremost we 
need to have better research to know precisely the extent of 
what the challenge we are faced with.
    Secondly, we need resources to be able to begin raising 
awareness on the part of producers, now your producers in Maine 
and those in New Mexico are fully aware of this, but I am not 
sure that all of the producers around the country are aware of 
it. So Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), I think, 
has a responsibility to raise awareness, to fill the knowledge 
gaps, and to begin figuring out soil health practices that can 
make a difference, potentially, in remediation.
    We also need to take a look, creatively, at programs like 
Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and Conservation Reserve 
Enhancement Program (CREP), just to determine whether or not 
they can be a response to whatever we need to do to remediate 
the soil. We need more research in terms of its impact on 
animals and crops, and we also need to make sure that our food 
safety folks are fully embracing and understanding of the need 
to test, to make sure that as we are inspecting meat, poultry, 
and processed eggs, that we know the impact, if any, of PFAS.
    So there is a lot of work to do. $20 million is probably 
not enough, but it is a start, and it is certainly more than 
the $5 million we got last year.
    Senator Collins. Thank you. Thank you, very much.
    Senator Heinrich. Chair Murray.
    Senator Murray. Well, thank you very much, Chair Heinrich, 
and Ranking Member Hoeven, I do look forward to working with 
both of you, and Vice Chair Collins, and everyone on this 
subcommittee, as we return to regular order for the first time 
in years.
    And I will keep saying it, it is not going to be easy, but 
we have to live up to our responsibility to pass these funding 
bills in a timely, bipartisan way to keep our families strong, 
and our economy strong, and our country competitive on the 
world stage. And as this hearing should remind all of us that 
requires a good deal more than just defense spending, after 
all, at the most basic level we can't have strong communities 
if people can't put food on the table.

                  RESEARCH INVESTMENTS IN FOOD SUPPLY

    And that is as important as it is obvious. We have to make 
sure that our food supply is secure, and that means protecting 
our families from unsafe food. It means protecting them from 
shortages, so avoiding, and mitigating supply chain 
disruptions, addressing the climate crisis, like droughts, 
which can threaten crops that all of us rely on.
    And it also means addressing food insecurity, so the food 
families need to stay safe and healthy, is available, and 
accessible, and affordable. This is essential to keeping our 
nation strong, not to mention competitive.
    For one thing, and speaking as a grandmother and a former 
preschool teacher, our kids cannot grow and thrive in body and 
mind if they are not getting the nutrition they need. Which is 
why the school lunch programs are so important, and why 
fighting food insecurity, and getting family support, is a 
priority of mine, as we negotiate the Farm Bill as well, this 
year.
    And as my colleagues know, agriculture is also a huge part 
of our economy. In my state, every day, apples, and cherries, 
and wheat, and potatoes, and pulse crops, and so many other 
commodities, from Washington State, are shipped across the 
world for people to enjoy. But we need to make sure that our 
farmers, and our growers, are getting the support they need to 
compete across the world as well, including through the 
research happening at institutions like my alma mater, 
Washington State University, and across the country, to address 
our water shortages, and our improved yields, and reduce 
inputs, and a lot more.
    So I am really glad we have the opportunity now to assess 
what we need to do to support our communities through the 
important programs here at the Department of Agriculture. And 
look forward to working with this committee as we put this bill 
together.
    So Mr. Secretary, I have a few questions for you, starting 
with: The growers in Washington State and across the country 
face a lot of challenges, extreme heat, wildfires, invasive 
pests, plant diseases. And USDA's research has supported 
American farmers and ranchers in adapting and responding to 
these challenges so they can continue to produce a safe and 
abundant food supply.
    This research is often carried out in partnership with our 
universities, like Washington State University, where students 
and faculty work together on solutions to these challenges. Can 
you speak to the importance of strong research investments in 
our Nation's food supply?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, they are essential, Madam Chair. 
And I would say that that this budget that we have proposed is 
suggesting an increase in the Agriculture and Food Research 
Initiative (AFRI) Program, which is the program that provides 
that partnership between our land-grant universities, historic 
Black colleges, minority serving institutions, to be able to 
conduct that research.
    I would say, frankly, that as a Nation we have underfunded 
research in agriculture for far too long. When you compare it 
to some of the other areas of our economy agriculture research 
has been underfunded for a substantial amount of time. And I am 
hopeful that we get the increase that we are seeking, because 
it does bear fruit it does provide increased productivity, 
greater resilience, adaptation and mitigation to climate, new 
opportunities to use agricultural waste product to produce a 
whole array of bio-based products that can improve job growth 
and farm income. So it is essential, and we would certainly be 
willing to talk to you in more detail about precisely where 
those resources should be.
    Senator Murray. So bottom line is, research saves money in 
the future, and helps produce more food, and all the things we 
need for our economy?
    Secretary Vilsack. Every dollar of research generates 
twenty dollars, or more, of economic opportunity.

                    CUTS TO FEDERAL FOOD ASSISTANCE

    Senator Murray. Yes. Mr. Secretary, I am very concerned 
about the House GOP calling for steep cuts to critical programs 
like our Federal Food Assistance. My family relied on food 
stamps when I was growing up, and my dad lost his job because 
he got sick. And so I really understand how important this is 
for people, and I am focused on making sure that we support 
SNAP and the families who rely on it, in our Farm Bill this 
year.
    As appropriators, we also have a role to play in making 
sure we have full funding for nutrition programs, WIC, school 
meals, fresh fruit and vegetable program. Can you talk to us 
about why it is so important that we fully fund the nutrition 
programs?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, the research has shown that the 
SNAP Program has a positive impact on reducing poverty, and for 
children it also improves children's health if, in fact, the 
benefits are meaningful. I think it is important for people to 
know who is actually receiving SNAP. More than 80 percent of 
SNAP recipients are either people with disabilities, senior 
citizens who worked all their life, but are living on a fixed 
income, or working moms and dads with children.
    There is a lot of conversation about able-bodied adults 
without dependents, but you need to know who those folks are. 
There was a survey done in nine states, I think Washington 
might have been one of those nine states, taking a look at who 
those able-bodied folks were, and what they found was that they 
were mostly men, and mostly homeless, mainly homeless. And I 
suspect that many of them were probably homeless veterans.
    And so I think as we look at the circumstances and 
situations to try to assist, I think we should be spending more 
time focusing on state's efforts with employment and training.
    Your state, by the way, has one of the premier employment 
and training efforts in terms of trying to connect people. If 
you think about it, and Senator Hoeven, he knows this. States 
know who the recipients are because they administer the SNAP 
Program, and they also know where the jobs are, and they also 
operate workforce development.
    And the question is: Why we can't do a better job of 
spending $100 million on employment and training, to basically 
allow those things to connect so that the jobs that are 
available, are linked to the people that need and can actually 
do them?

                     CUTS TO CONSERVATION PROGRAMS

    Senator Murray. Thank you very much for that. And finally, 
in Washington State I have a lot of constituents working on 
regionally important water storage projects in the Yakima and 
Columbia basins. Those projects require ongoing technical 
assistance, and support from local staff at the National 
Resources Conservation Service. I often hear about how long it 
takes to work with NRCS, or to get assistance.
    Underfunded local staff are stretched really thin and it 
would be an enormous mistake, I believe, to make things worse 
by gutting these agencies working to conserve our vital 
watersheds. Can you speak to what the risks are to our folks 
who are working on these projects if we cut these budgets?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, the reality is that you will have 
84,000--even the most--if you take not the most draconian 
reduction that people are talking about, but the less draconian 
version, it is 84,000 farmers who won't get the technical 
assistance that they need in order to complete the planning, in 
order to get the conservation benefit that they seek for their 
operation.
    So it is a very real impact, and we have made a concerted 
effort to try to rebuild the workforce at NRCS, because when I 
came back to this job there were 6,500 fewer people working at 
USDA than before, and the morale was incredibly low. So we have 
had a process of trying to rebuild both the workforce and the 
morale.
    Senator Murray. Thank you very much. I absolutely agree.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Heinrich. Ranking Member Hoeven.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                  CONCENTRATION OF SLAUGHTER INDUSTRY

    Secretary, we have to do more to address the concentration 
and the slaughter industry, particularly as regards to the 
cattle industry, I know you share that belief and concern, and 
there is a variety of things that we are doing, obviously we 
have to continue to press on the practices of the large four 
slaughterhouses, the processors, also, I think you are making 
progress with alternatives, we are working hard on that, and I 
am seeing that in our state and across, the country.
    And I think that is very important and very beneficial, but 
another thing that we have worked on--excuse me--is a cattle 
contract library. And we allocated $2 million out of this 
committee, and the authorization moved forward with a pilot 
program. I think this is very valuable in terms of providing 
more information to producers in regard to Agricultural 
Marketing Agreement (AMA), and trying to promote more 
transparency and competition. I know you got your rule out, 
tell me where you are with it? How you think it is going? What 
we need to do?
    Secretary Vilsack. We put the rule out in January, and 
began the process of putting stuff online. It is interesting, 
our team believes, by virtue of what we knew before the rule 
was proposed, and what we are seeing being provided by the 
industry that adjustments have already been made to some 
contracts in a positive way for producers.
    Senator Hoeven. Good.
    Secretary Vilsack. So I think the transparency, the 
sunlight is an incredibly important tool. We are obviously 
going to continue to do that, and to provide as much 
information so people can make a comparative reaction, and a 
comparative study of the contract that they are being offered, 
versus what others have been.
    Senator Hoeven. That program is important. The work you are 
doing right now is really important, we will look to make it a 
permanent program in the Farm Bill, and so we are learning--you 
know, as you put it into play the experience that you gather 
here is going to be really important, as we set up a permanent 
authorization and funding for the program.
    So we will be looking to that and drawing on the input, the 
experience, and so forth that you pick up from the producers. 
And it is really important because of the challenge of getting 
the various associations to work together in cases like this 
it--you know, is very beneficial that we are getting that done, 
and that that experience you draw on is going to be very 
valuable to us, how to have a good--the most effective program 
going forward.

                       CATTLE IDENTIFICATION TAGS

    Cattle identification tags, you have got your rule out for 
public comment, I guess my concerns would be cost and any 
mandatory nature of that, and how that is going to be handled 
vis-`-vis our producers, it is like what, 30 bucks an animal, 
roughly. And so that, you know, there is a cost, so I think 
your original estimate is about $26 million, how are you going 
to handle that, so that we are not putting a burden on our 
producers out there?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, the benefit of this program is for 
producers themselves, because if we have an incident and the 
chances are that something will occur, the ability to be able 
to identify where that incident occurs, and to be able to 
contain it to a particular region, or a particular farm, is 
going to be beneficial to trade.
    Senator Hoeven. I agree on the benefit, I am just wondering 
how you are going to handle the cost, and the mandatory nature, 
you know, how our cowboys react to that stuff, so we want them 
to see it as the beneficial tool it is.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, that is why we have been working 
with the Cattlemen's Association, and other organizations, who 
are in favor of this mandatory effort. I don't know that we 
have, necessarily, had a conversation specifically. I haven't 
had a conversation specifically about cost, but I am happy to 
take that back to our team, and see what----
    Senator Hoeven. Yeah. I hope you are working with the 
associations on how you are going to handle that aspect of it. 
And I do recognize the benefit of the tool, as do they.

                        CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE

    Chronic Wasting Disease, the Chairman is an avid hunter, I 
actually do enjoy hunting myself, and so we worked together on 
the legislation for Chronic Wasting Disease, and he did a 
tremendous job leading that effort. But really, one of the most 
important aspects of it is, for the first time we actually have 
domestic producers and the outdoorsmen working together rather 
than jockeying against each other trying to get the funding, 
and trying to get the research done that they want.
    We finally brought them together in this initiative, and 
that is critical, and we will, you know, obviously it is 
authorized at $70 million, will work to increase funding, we 
are already doing that, what is going to be most effective here 
to advance the research in your opinion? And is there something 
else we should be doing?
    Secretary Vilsack. I think continuing to make sure that 
there isn't appropriate division of those resources between 
domestic and wild, that we don't seem to be favoring one or the 
other recognizing, as you just mentioned, the need for these 
folks to work together, and making sure that they see that this 
program is benefiting all sides in a fairly appropriate way, I 
think this is very important.
    And then secondly, I think making sure that we have the 
resources on the research side, to be able to really begin a 
process of understanding, how does this get transmitted, and 
what can we do from a domestic perspective to prevent 
transmission. And we have got that issue frankly, and a lot of 
other species as well.
    Senator Hoeven. That is the breakthrough, that we have got 
them working together, and then USDA working with the local--or 
with the State Department of Ag, and their outdoor resources 
people, I think can really help keep that cooperation going.
    Secretary Vilsack. Absolutely.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you.
    Senator Heinrich. Senator Manchin.
    Senator Manchin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Secretary, thank you, so much for all your service, and 
feeding America, especially the children. I appreciate it more 
than you know.

                          DEFINITION OF RURAL

    I am going to switch gears just a little bit based on rural 
America, and what we deal with. You and all of your staff and 
everything, you do an awful lot more than just feed us. There 
is an awful lot of economic activity that goes on, that 
sometimes people aren't aware of, and myself, has not been, 
until you and I spoke about what opportunities were out there.
    Here is the problem we have, sir. The Economic Research 
Service, I think was in your all, bailiwick, develops various 
codes and criteria to help define rural America. The way I look 
at it is about 66 million people living what I would consider 
rural America. And currently, there is no code accurately that 
captures the mountainous rural areas, which much difference; 
the mountainous rural, versus agriculture rural, two different 
things.
    That is something we have not been able to see and it is 
difficult for us to do anything as far as the building towers 
to Internet, and all this, and delivering those services, are 
so much more expensive. So the project was started in 2021, and 
as of today we have not seen the Phase I published report. If 
you could give us any update on that, if you have it? If not, 
get back to me on that.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I will have to get back to you on 
it, Senator. But I would say this is an ongoing problem in 
terms of the definition of ``rural''. There are multiple 
definitions which creates a lot of confusion and a lot of 
uncertainty.
    Senator Manchin. Oh, I know.
    Secretary Vilsack.  So I will be happy to work with you on 
that.
    Senator Manchin. As a former Governor in serving, and 
yourself, and I, we serve together. But as a former Governor 
you have a lot of rule, at least in Iowa, you know--the problem 
that happens, I have seen it since I have been here 12 years, 
is when money is disbursed, whether it is in education, whether 
it is in health care, whether it is in agriculture, whatever it 
is, the rural areas do not get their proportion of shares.
    So if there is 20 percent of the population that is 
classified ``living in a rural area'', in my state, I don't 
have one town, I don't have one city bigger than 50,000 people. 
So I am a state of towns; 1.8 million people in a state of 
towns, but it is as rural as it gets. And it is as wonderful, 
it is just wild and wonderful, it is as wonderful as it gets, 
but they get left out. When we look at the national money that 
goes to rural America, it is only about 7-, 8-, 9 percent of 
Federal funding.
    Because I guess showing the biggest bang for your buck, it 
is better if you have the 1,000,000 people, versus 50,000 
people, but the services are just as needed. That is the 
problem we are running into.
    Secretary Vilsack. They are, but there is also a 
contribution that rural America makes, a disproportionate 
contribution that speaks to our military.
    Senator Manchin. Oh.
    Secretary Vilsack. People often forget that 
disproportionate number of our military come from those small 
towns in West Virginia and Iowa.

                               RECONNECT

    Senator Manchin. And Appalachia, I mean Appalachia 
especially. Let me go into this one here. President Biden 
requested another 400 million of the ReConnect Program, in his 
fiscal year 2024 Budget that he just put out. That is in 
addition to the $348 million we had in the last budget, and 
that is on top of the $2 billion in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law (BIL).
    So have we put billions of dollars out there, and what we 
are concerned about is, it is mammoth for you all I know that, 
but coordinating that effort to be able to administer working 
with Federal Communications Commission (FCC), National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and 
Treasury. How is that going or where is the stumbling block?
    Secretary Vilsack. I am pleased to tell you that by this 
summer we will have all of the BIL money, the Infrastructure 
money obligated, and the reason for that we really have spent a 
lot of time trying to do this, so that it will complement the 
work that will come next by NTIA and the Commerce Department, 
and the FCC, because we want to basically use our resources to 
upgrade, as best we can, the unserved and underserved areas so 
that they have meaningful broadband.
    And then as the mapping gets completed, we will then know 
where the real serious gaps are which then will provide the 
resources under the infrastructure law for commerce, and so 
forth, to be able to invest through states. So we are 
coordinating. We are making sure they know where we are 
investing the money so that we are not overbuilding, and not 
duplicating.
    Senator Manchin. Well, let me just say, in closing, I 
sincerely--in my lifetime I have never seen anyone has as much 
knowledge as you, and as much experience in this job, coming 
from where you came from, and also the states you represented, 
to being in this position, and the amount of years you were 
before, and one and done was not enough for the public service 
you are giving, and I just thank you, because you can help us 
so much, every one of you all.
    I call him Tom, but I call him Governor, and I call him my 
friend, he knows more about how to help your areas as far as in 
getting other, than just the feeding of America, but basically 
economic development. There is so much that they can offer in 
that office, that we are not--we are just not accessing. So 
thank you. Thank you, my friend.
    Secretary Vilsack. I appreciate it.
    Senator Heinrich. Well said, Senator Manchin.
    Senator Hyde-Smith.

                          DISASTER ASSISTANCE

    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I 
certainly appreciate the opportunity to do this, and thank you 
for being here. But first of all, I want to tell you how much I 
appreciate your staff reaching out to us over the weekend with 
the Mississippi tornadoes. Within hours after the storm they 
were reaching out to the Mississippi delegation. And I 
certainly appreciate that.
    And seeing the devastation first-hand, you know, we have 
just gone into that mode of trying to help these people as much 
as we can. Most of this area is farming area, the Mississippi 
Delta, and other areas as well. But you know, I just was up 
there after the storm, and the day after that. And seeing the 
devastation, you know, as resilient as we are, before we dive 
into the details of the funding, I was just hoping that you 
could kind of offer some information for the rural communities 
that were affected.
    For instance USDA's recent press release following these 
tornadoes stated: Food Safety and Inspection Services (FSTS) 
helping affected residents reduce their risk of food-borne 
illnesses. Due to the power outages that we are looking at, the 
Risk Management Agency offers several risk protection tools to 
offset crop production and tree losses for certain crop 
insurance products.
    But the Farm Service Agency offers the Livestock Indemnity 
Program, and the Tree Assistance Program, and the Emergency 
Conservation Program, several things there, and NRCS can help 
address natural resources concern, by providing the cost 
assistance for work such as debris removal. But would you, 
please, elaborate a little bit on the areas of assistance 
offered, and how they can access this?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, first of all, I would encourage 
you to take a look at the Farmers.gov website, which has this 
document on it, which basically contains many of the programs 
that you just mentioned but more than the ones that you 
mentioned, and basically the kind of disaster they cover, and 
the kind of assistance that they can provide, and the 
information necessary. That would be the first order of 
business.
    The second order of business is making sure that state 
officials and your staff reach out to the State Rural 
Development Director for the State of Mississippi. I mean our 
heart goes out. As a former governor, I have toured many 
tornado damaged sites, and it is absolutely devastating to 
people. They lose their home in a matter of seconds, and 
unfortunately, in your state, loss of life as well.
    But the Rural Development folks can be there to begin the 
process of figuring out: How do we rebuild? How do we create 
the opportunities for housing for the community facilities that 
have been damaged or destroyed? What kind of resources could be 
available?
    And the Farm Service folks are there, obviously, to begin 
the process of assessing the level of damage, so that crop 
insurance and any risk management tools, as you well know from 
your experience as commissioner down there, agriculture; that 
we provide as quickly, a response to the loss of production as 
possible.
    So Farmers.gov, State Rural Development Director, and 
working with the local FSA Office, I think would be where I 
would start.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Well, I certainly appreciate that 
because so much equipment got destroyed. You know, we are in 
the middle of planting corn, and the equipment is just gone.
    Secretary Vilsack. There is also a Disaster SNAP Program 
that basically makes it a little bit easy for people who may 
have lost their SNAP Card, because the tornado destroyed their 
home.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Yeah. They don't even have vehicles.
    Secretary Vilsack. Right.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. You know, they have no way--no mode of 
transportation right now to even--to get somewhere, but we are 
going to recover, there is no doubt. We have some great folks 
there. But I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciated 
that.

                   HIGHLY PATHOGENIC AVIAN INFLUENZA

    One thing I want to mention, I only have a little time 
left. The 2022-2023 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), 
the outbreak is the worst health crisis emergency in U.S. 
history. As Ag Commissioner, this kept me awake at night, no 
doubt. But paired with critical shortages of veterinarians in 
rural, food, animal, and public practice, this outbreak has 
been devastating for the poultry, turkey, and egg industries, 
which we are a huge poultry state and egg state.
    But it has also directly affected millions of families who 
are struggling to keep up with the resulting rising cost of 
poultry and eggs. But I recognize and appreciate that the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, APHIS, is working 
tirelessly to control Avian Influenza. But it seems as though 
having more food animal veterinarians, and more vets in APHIS 
would be helpful for current and future mitigation efforts.
    But I also noticed that your budget includes $3 million for 
incentives to recruit and retain public health veterinarians 
for food, and safety, and inspection, services. So clearly USDA 
understands the great need for veterinarians working in areas 
besides small, animal practice, which is great, we all love, 
and we have to have but, you know, it is just so much more 
attractive and lucrative.
    But the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program, which 
your budget includes, helps alleviate veterinary shortages in 
rural, and Food Animal Practice Government agencies like APHIS 
and FSIS, by providing money towards the educational loans.
    So you know, this subcommittee allocates the funds to this 
program, and a major portion of those funds go right back to 
the Federal Government because of the 39 percent Federal 
withholding tax, which is just incredible on that program, at 
its tax, 39 percent.
    So only $6.1 million of the $10 million provided by 
Congress for this program, in fiscal 2023, will actually be put 
toward the educational loans of the veterinarians, and to 
address these critical veterinary shortages.
    Can you respond to that to help prevent animal health 
emergencies, and what actions we can take to address this--
shortages in both private Food Animal Practice, and in state, 
Federal Government, that 39 percent just blows me away.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I am happy to take a look at that, 
Senator. But I will tell you, the biggest problem we have is 
retaining folks that we actually do get. They actually end up 
starting at APHIS, they are excited about their job, they do an 
amazing job for a year or two, and then someone basically says 
to them: Hey, in the private sector you can make 10-, 20-, 
25,000, $50,000 more, why don't you come over to the private 
practice? And that, that is the challenge.
    Our compensation system has got to be looked at from--and 
when I say ``our'' I mean the Federal compensation system--so 
it is competitive. And we have to have more flexibility in 
terms of the ability to use retention resources to be able to 
retain these folks, because we can get them in the door we 
just, we are having a hard time keeping them.
    The loan repayment is one aspect of it, but there are many, 
many other aspects in terms of lack of competitive nature of 
our compensation system.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. I would really appreciate some help 
with trying to offset that system.
    I am sorry for going over my time, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Heinrich. Senator Merkley.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                          DROUGHT IN THE WEST

    And Mr. Secretary, good to see you; and I want to talk a 
little bit about drought in the west.
    And in the eastern part and southern part of my state we 
have had droughts that have gone on year-after-year, it is also 
associated with the lower snowpack we have in the Cascades. I 
was just up at Crater Lake where they showed that they have 
lost 240 inches of average snowpack over the last 90 years, 
complicating the lack of rainfall during the spring and summer.
    And the irrigation districts are responding by, one, 
changing their practices on the farm to get more crop with less 
water, but then also by piping their canals. And this piping 
has been essential because of the massive amount of water that 
is lost in open ditches, through evaporation and groundwater.
    And that effort has been explored in an article, The 
Washington Post, ``The Future of the American West is in 
Central Oregon'', which is about that vast effort to pipe to 
save our agriculture and I want to submit it for the record
    Senator Heinrich. Without objection.
    [The website link for the article follows:]

    https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-08-28/central-
oregon-is-the-future-of-the-american-west?embedded-checkout=true

    Senator Merkley. Thank you. So this effort has been 
recognized in the Western Water and Working Lands Framework, 
and that NRCS philosophy notes that water management is 
essential or we lose agriculture across a broad swath of the 
West. Are you familiar with that NRCS Framework, and do you 
support that?
    Secretary Vilsack. I am very familiar. The six challenges 
and thirteen strategies, and the $25 million that we have 
allocated to the Department of Interior WaterSMART Project?
    Senator Merkley. Thank you.
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes, I am.
    Senator Merkley. I knew you would know every nuance of it. 
But I asked that simply because there is a tool that was 
incredibly effective that I worked to revitalize, with Senator 
Cochran, the 566 Program which had basically gone out of 
existence. And that program was being used to help with the 
piping of the irrigation districts in the West.
    And over the last couple years the Administration has 
shifted that 566 money away from helping with piping in the 
West, and I am basically here to say: Can we recognize that 
this is an incredibly powerful tool to help address the goals 
in the Western Water and Working Lands Framework, and can we 
move some of that funding back into the direction of helping 
the Western Irrigation projects with their piping challenges?
    Secretary Vilsack. It seems as if that would be consistent 
with one or more of the strategies to modernize the water 
infrastructure and the complete watershed projects; and also to 
do a better job of water management. So it would seem to fit 
within the strategies that the framework has called for.
    Senator Merkley. It definitely fits. And I would appreciate 
any help that we can get. We have been able, through our 
community initiated projects, to direct a small amount of 
money. This is, if you will, the congressionally directed 
spending, which in Oregon we call ``community initiated''. And 
I can tell you the irrigation districts are all completing 
watershed plans to be eligible for this program.
    And well, I am doing all I can to help them survive a very 
difficult changing climate where water efficiency will help 
save them, but piping is essential, and for that piping 566, is 
essential so I ask for your help in shifting some of those 
resources.
    Secretary Vilsack. So I will take a look at it, Senator.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you very much.
    Senator Heinrich. Senator Moran.
    Senator Moran. Chairman, thank you.
    Mr. Secretary, thank you, for being here. Thank you for 
your service to farmers and ranchers across the country, and in 
Kansas, in particular. You and I are about to have a high-five 
moment.
    Secretary Vilsack. Yeah.

                   NATIONAL BIO AGRO-SCIENCE FACILITY

    Senator Moran. Thank you for working with me to pick a date 
for you to be in Kansas, and I want to take several moments, 
but want to give you a moment to highlight a development that 
began a long time ago as a result of the 9/11 Commission.
    The Secretary will be in Kansas to cut a ribbon on, the 
National Bio Agro-Science Facility (NBAF), designed to protect 
public health and our food safety, managed by USDA, 
Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and APHIS, and it will 
contain the BL-4 Biocontainment Laboratory.
    You were there, Mr. Secretary, in May of 2015, now 8 years 
ago, a long time coming, but a very important facility and 
asset for the Department of Agriculture, American farmers and 
ranchers, and in fact every American citizen, and around the 
globe.
    I would be glad to have you highlight why you think this--
if you do, why you think this is a benefit to the American 
people?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, Senator, it absolutely is. It 
modernizes our process and our ability to investigate and to 
research some of the major challenges and threats to American 
agriculture, whether it is African Swine Fever, or Foot-and-
Mouth Disease, or some of the other seven critical diseases 
that could cripple our livestock industry which, obviously, 
would impact and affect our entire economy and our food 
security.
    In addition, this facility will also be where the Vaccine 
Bank is housed, and as we develop vaccines to try to deal with 
some of these threats, obviously being able to stockpile 
appropriately and safely, those vaccines are incredibly 
important. There are also, a great deal of research is going to 
be done on the countermeasures, the biosecurity initiatives 
that are a part of protecting our livestock industry.
    So this is critically important. And the fact it has taken 
as long as it has, is because of the minute nature of the 
protections and security that is required as we move from Plum 
Island to Manhattan, Kansas.
    So I am looking forward to welcoming, and to cutting that 
ribbon. And I am sure that you will have a pair of scissors, 
and I am pretty sure Senator Roberts will have a pair of 
scissors.
    Senator Moran. I appreciate you being there, and I look 
forward to seeing you in Kansas on May the 24th. Thank you.
    Secretary Vilsack. Looking forward to it.

                   GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISM CORN

    Senator Moran. Mr. Secretary, I was in Mexico City, I met 
with President Obrador may be a week ago Sunday. Maybe in your 
answer to my question you can explain your smile. I raised my 
concerns about the efforts to ban genetically modified organism 
(GMO) corn, I was encouraged to hear what I thought was said, 
which was that the matter could be resolved in the consultation 
stage, rather than reach dispute settlement.
    That was then followed by the suggestion that the United 
States and Mexico ought to do an additional study about the 
safety of GMO. Does the USDA continue to believe that the 
science on this matter is conclusive, and will it continue to 
fight to ensure full and fair access to the Mexican market?
    Secretary Vilsack. Senator, and the reason I smiled is 
because I have had two such meetings with President Obrador, 
and I am fairly certain that what he told me on those occasions 
is exactly what he told you. And the reality is that we don't 
need another study, there are literally hundreds of studies 
about the safety of this technology, and that has been 
explained to the President. It has also been explained to the 
President that 66 percent of his feed needs for his livestock 
industry come from biotech corn that is grown and raised in the 
United States.
    The challenge is that he is very--as you probably found 
out--very proud of the white corn that is produced, the maize 
that is produced in Mexico. And I think he has put himself in a 
situation, a political situation that is very hard for him to 
move out of.
    At the same time, by virtue of banning the ability to have 
white corn from Nebraska, or other states come into Mexico we 
are--he is asking us to acknowledge a non-scientific basis for 
such a ban, and we can't do that. It is fundamental to our 
trade strategy and philosophy, and our approach to the rest of 
the world that we want a science-based system, and we believe 
in the safety of biotech products, we believe in the science 
behind it, and that has been explained to the President, 
politely, on a number of occasions.
    Senator Moran. Is there any question about what our trade 
agreement is between Canada, and Mexico, and the United States.
    Secretary Vilsack. Not in our view.
    Senator Moran. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I would conclude 
just by telling that--I would feel guilty if I didn't say this.
    Mr. Secretary, you and I have worked in your previous time 
at USDA on trying to export and increase trade around the 
world, I would encourage you and the administration that you 
work in, to look for opportunities to reach agreements with 
other nations, singular and then collectively, trade is hugely 
important, and while we face challenges in making sure that we 
do trade agreements right and they are enforced, farmers in 
Kansas, and across the country depend upon the ability to 
export what they do, around the globe.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, the good news is that we have had 
over $15 billion of additional opportunities in market access 
created in the last 2 years. So we will continue to do that.
    Senator Moran. Thank you.
    Senator Heinrich. Senator Fischer.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                         PRECISION AGRICULTURE

    Mr. Secretary, so nice to see you again. A couple of weeks 
ago we had the opportunity to talk about the importance of 
precision agriculture, and I would like to talk about an 
exciting opportunity from USDA AG Research Service.
    As you know, over the past couple of years Congress has 
appropriated $31.2 million to begin construction on a new USDA-
ARS National Center for Resilient and Regenerative Precision 
Agriculture, co-located at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
Those already-appropriated funds are going to allow 
construction of a research greenhouse to begin on that project. 
And I was glad to see in the fiscal year 2024 request for an 
additional 60 USDA-ARS employees to Lincoln.
    Can you discuss the need for those additional ARS 
employees, and the vital research that the National Center for 
Resilient and Regenerative Precision Agriculture will perform?
    Secretary Vilsack. This is a process of rebuilding the 
workforce at ARS, and providing a complement to the research it 
has done through the AFRI Program, which is the grant program 
to land-grant universities.
    We are very proud of the work that we do at ARS, but we 
just need more people, we need more bodies, and we need the 
ability to recruit bright young people to make sure that we 
have a constant stream of bright people. We have proposed this 
because we like working with the University of Nebraska. We 
think that they have a concept and a vision that is incredibly 
important to the future of agriculture as it relates to our 
response to climate.
    We are going to have to produce more with less, and the 
only way you can do that is by better understanding how to use 
the inputs that you have in the most effective way, how you can 
have seed technologies that are more beneficial and more 
efficient in how they use the inputs. And then be able to 
provide the information to farmers so that they can utilize 
that information in the best possible way to improve their 
productivity and their profitability.
    So this is an important enterprise, which is why we 
proposed additional investments, not only of people, but also 
money.
    Senator Fischer. And I hope that Congress is going to 
quickly provide Appropriations so we can see the construction 
of the facility as well.

                        IRA CONSERVATION FUNDING

    In the Inflation Reduction Act it provided an addition of 
$19.5 billion to several USDA conservation programs, text of 
the IRA departed from the resource concerns agreed to in the 
Bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill, and it restricted how these funds 
could be used to improving soil carbon, reducing nitrogen 
losses, or to reduce capture, avoid or sequester carbon 
dioxide, methane, or nitrous oxide emissions associated with 
agricultural production.
    How is the USDA interpreting that restriction placed on IRA 
conservation funds? For example, how will you look at a 
producer who wants to use Environmental Quality Incentives 
Programs (EQIP) cost-share funding to upgrade their irrigation 
pivot, for example, so they can optimize their water usage? 
Would that, or would they be at a disadvantage under the IRA 
funding?
    Secretary Vilsack. What I can tell you, Senator, and I will 
get a specific answer to that hypothetical. I can tell you that 
the NRCS is focused on utilizing the climate-smart practices 
that we have identified that we are currently funding under the 
EQIP Program and using the IRA resources to basically ensure 
that those practices are targeted or benefited. I mean, the 
reality is, I think it is--there are 45 of them, so there is 
quite a broad range and the goal here is to try to encourage 
more of that. But I will ask our team to get back to you on the 
specific hypothetical you have provided.
    Senator Fischer. Yeah. That would be great. I am new on 
this committee, and I am excited to be on this committee 
because I want to be able to make sure that we are funding 
programs that work, and the producers use, where they are able 
to have fewer inputs, and also be more profitable. And I have I 
think if we can make those determinations that really work on 
the ground, it is going to help not just rural America, it is 
going to help our conservation methods as well.
    Last question: The livestock is the biggest sector in 
Nebraska, we always talk about that. It is a huge economic 
engine. We have a Meat Animal Research Center in Clay Center. 
And I was glad to see the budget request included an addition 
of 15 employees at U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (MARC), as 
well as an increase in ARS funding for their Livestock 
Production Program. How would increased staff at MARC help 
carry out research related to critical livestock industry 
priorities, including increased environmental sustainability, 
improved production efficiencies, and really optimize the use 
of our natural resources?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I think we are going to learn 
quite a bit, not only for the work that is specifically done at 
that Center, but also as we institute our partnership for 
climate-smart commodities there is going to be a significant 
amount of measurement, monitoring, verification, and 
accumulation of data.
    Senator Fischer. Mm-hmm.
    Secretary Vilsack. That in turn can be provided to ARS 
facilities, into other facilities, in terms of being able to 
educate them about what we know works, and frankly we are going 
to find out stuff that doesn't work. And we want to make sure 
that we are not funding that, or we are not targeting resources 
to what doesn't work.
    So I think it is a combination of the research that they 
would normally do, but it is also learning from the experience 
in virtually every commodity including livestock, there are a 
number of livestock projects in that Climate-Smart. So I think 
you are going to learn a lot from that.
    Senator Fischer. Okay. Great. I know specifically of one 
Ph.D. student who is doing research at the University of 
Nebraska, who has been conducting it, she has for over 5 years, 
to look at livestock emissions. And I think that is going to 
change the perception out there greatly, by the public, and 
really look at the benefits of livestock to the environment.
    Secretary Vilsack. We need to reduce methane, and we can. 
There are strategies, and we also need to capture it and 
convert it.
    Senator Fischer. Yeah, thanks.
    Senator Heinrich. Senator Tester.
    Senator Tester. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank you 
and the Ranking Member for having this hearing.

                      FARM SERVICE AGENCY STAFFING

    I want to thank you for being here, Secretary Vilsack, I 
appreciate it. You know, I have had a number of Farm Bill 
listening sessions since this is a Farm Bill year, and these 
haven't been invitation, this has been opening the doors and 
let folks in to speak their mind. And we have heard things that 
you have heard, like the reference price needs to go up because 
of inflation. We have heard things like conservation programs, 
like EQIP, need more flexibility, because we don't have enough 
well drillers or dirt movers to get these jobs done within 
timeframes.
    We have heard things like the Crop Insurance Program, 
especially with the push of cover crops needs to be increased 
to cover a lot of those. We have heard a lot about food 
security because we both know that democracies don't work very 
well when you have a population that is hungry.
    One of the things that I have heard about that I didn't 
expect to hear about, but I have heard it at every one of them, 
is that it is really hard to hire people in our FSA offices. We 
have got 236 total FSA positions in Montana, roughly 40 of them 
are vacant on any given day. Part of the problem is competitive 
salaries. The starting salary in Montana is $33,700 if you 
don't have a degree, $37,700 if you do.
    I can tell you. And you know this, you know this, Mr. 
Secretary, you can probably make money doing damn near anything 
else but being a school teacher. Okay, that is probably the 
only thing you couldn't do. We do not have locality pay in 
Montana, and so a place like Bozeman, which is where our state 
office is, where the cost of a house is equivalent to a house 
in San Francisco, you are just not going to get people to work, 
you just aren't going to get people to work at those wages.
    So my question is, in your budget do you have adequate 
dollars so that we can recruit some people; because it truly is 
a crisis situation? I use our office in Chouteau County and 
they felt the turnover, but in some of these offices it has 
been devastating. And you know very well, we can do the best 
job putting a Farm Bill up, and you can do the best job 
implementing it, if you don't have people on the ground we are 
screwed.
    Secretary Vilsack. Senator, I couldn't agree with you more. 
And this isn't just your FSA office issue, it is an issue 
across FSA, it is not just an FSA issue, it is an issue across 
all of our mission areas. And it is, in part, a result of the 
overall Federal system that is in place, and we are trying to 
work with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to get a 
better understanding of how we might be able to reclassify 
people, and figure out ways in which we can provide more 
resources, and more incentives for people to work at USDA.
    Senator Tester. So I am willing to work with you at the 
OPM. You are right. It is a system-wide problem within Ag, 
within the Veterans Affairs (VA), a number of other agencies, 
if not every other agency. But let us say we get OPM to do that 
reclassification, will this budget support it?
    Secretary Vilsack. I believe it will. I mean, we are we are 
asking for more resources so that we can hire more people. So I 
think we have the capacity. The challenge isn't just simply 
getting people, Senator, it is also retaining them.
    Senator Tester. Yes. That is correct.
    Secretary Vilsack. That is actually, to a certain extent, 
that is an even greater problem, because as soon as they start 
working somebody--here is what happens in these FSA offices, 
the loan officers in particular, they get trained by us, get 
trained well.
    Senator Tester. Go to the bank.
    Secretary Vilsack. And then a bank comes in and says: Hey, 
you can we can make $5,000 more. And off they go. So we have 
the capacity I think in our budget to do some retention stuff, 
but we need, we need more permission.
    Senator Tester. Well, I think it is a problem, and I would 
have heard about it, at every group I went to. I mean these 
folks, they didn't get together and plan this, I didn't give 
them talking points. They came in, it came up organically. It 
is an important problem.
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes.

                             BRAZILIAN BEEF

    Senator Tester. I want to talk about something else that 
isn't nearly as pleasant as not being able to hire or keep 
employees, believe it or not. And that is Brazilian beef. So I 
have just got to tell you, I have had bills to ban it, I think 
it is a bipartisan concern. Earlier this year Brazil had 
another case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) it took 
them, it took them 35 days to report it. I would hope it 
doesn't take us 35 days to report if we have it here, although 
we don't, which is an issue that if we get it here it raises 
hell with our beef industry.
    My question is, does it take an act of Congress to ban 
Brazilian beef, or can you do it? And if you can, why not do 
it?
    Secretary Vilsack. This was an atypical case, Senator, and 
it is sort of like: Do you do you believe in the Golden Rule? 
Because if you do it to Brazil, Brazil can do it to us; we 
actually have had atypical BSE cases. And if you want the rest 
of the world to ban our beef, for an atypical case, which is 
not recognized as a bankable event by the World Health 
Organization (WHO), and the animal health organizations, that 
is the challenge, all right.
    We have communicated to Brazil our unhappiness about the 
tardiness and the lateness with which they have identified 
this. We are happy to help them with their testing to make sure 
that they get information to us quickly as possible. But I 
think for an atypical case I think you are going down a road 
that is pretty slippery, and I don't think we have the 
authority to do it.
    Senator Tester. And I am over time. So here is the issue. I 
don't think you would disagree with the fact, that we raise the 
best beef in the world, we raise the best Ag products in the 
world. And that is not brag. I believe that is absolute 
unequivocal fact. When we have a situation where we are having 
a generation of ranchers go broke because of an issue that you 
and I agree on, the amount of consolidation in the industry, 
and the processing industry, and one of those processors is 
JBS, which is a Brazilian company, I think we ought to do our 
level best not only to hold them accountable to make sure they 
are following the Packers and Stockyards Act, but hold them to 
extremely high standards, when it comes to bringing in 
Brazilian beef, because I think that is where most of it is 
coming through.
    Secretary Vilsack. It is certainly fair, that they should 
be held to a high standard in terms of the safety of the 
product.
    Senator Tester. Okay. Thank you.
    Senator Heinrich. Secretary, we are going to try to do a 
quick second round, if you are amenable to that?
    Secretary Vilsack. I didn't know I had a choice.
    Senator Heinrich. You seem to be doing fine so far, so we 
are not letting you off the hook just yet.

                    SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSING RECAPTURE

    I mentioned the single-family housing recapture proposal 
and, you know, the challenge with those balloon payments. Can 
you just talk a little bit about how important this initiative 
is, and how it would improve access to affordable housing in 
rural America?
    Secretary Vilsack. If you want to create distrust in 
government, continue this process. People, basically, they sign 
a loan document, they don't quite understand you are getting a 
loan, interest subsidy, and you know, interest rates going to 
be lower but, boy, you know, 20 years from now when you sell 
it, or when your heirs sell it, you are going to have a--you 
know, you are going to have a bill that you are going to have 
to pay, and it is going to be pretty substantial.
    Senator Heinrich. Yeah.
    Secretary Vilsack. It is an outrage--I mean, to me, it is 
an outrageous process because it comes as a tremendous 
surprise, especially when ``mom'' and ``dad'' are gone, and the 
kids are selling the house, and then they are set--good news is 
you sold the house, the bad news is, you owe the Government 
$27,000, and they go--that is not what we should be doing.
    Senator Heinrich. I don't know how we got here, but we need 
to fix it.
    Secretary Vilsack. I don't know either, I don't know, and 
there may have been a rationale behind it, but it undercuts 
trust in government and to me that is the principal reason for 
getting rid of it, and to do it retroactively so that we don't 
surprise any more folks.

                   PROCESSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR BISON

    Senator Heinrich. Thank you. Both the Ranking Member and I 
have a special interest in bison. We actually designated bison 
the ``National Mammal'' a few years ago.
    We have a lot of interest in bison production in New 
Mexico, particularly with some of our tribes, and Pueblo 
producers. What do you see as the USDA's role in aiding 
producers, and in particular like expanding access to 
processing opportunities for those producers?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, we have had two initiatives, one 
basically taking a look at existing processing facilities, and 
giving them resources to be able to expand their market 
capacity, and market reach, two bison operations have received 
those Meat and Poultry Inspection Readiness Grants.
    I think--if you are patient with us--within the next month 
or two you will see there will be a specific effort to provide 
additional resources for tribal processing, which obviously 
will be focused a great deal on bison. We have also, as part of 
our effort on food sovereignty, with tribes we have tried to 
integrate more bison purchasing, and more bison in some of our 
feeding programs.
    And also I am pleased to note that the Partnership for 
Climate-Smart Agriculture Commodities included several bison 
projects as well, so there is a great deal of effort, both in 
terms of creating market opportunities, expanding processing 
capacity, and being able to incorporate bison into any climate-
smart initiatives that we are developing.
    Senator Heinrich. And I appreciate your focus on it. I 
would mention, as you are looking at that production side, the 
concept of shared resources for mobile processing is something 
there is an awful lot of interest in and something to bear some 
focus.
    Secretary Vilsack. There is a loan guarantee program that 
we have that is basically providing resources for mobile 
slaughter and processing, it is a loan program, but it is a 
guaranteed program with lower interest rates. That is something 
that folks could look at as well.

                              POLLINATORS

    Senator Heinrich. Great. Thank you. We have had a lot of 
challenges with pollinators in recent years, and an enormous 
amount of our agricultural production is directly dependent on 
pollinators, what are we doing in this budget around ensuring 
the long-term success of a whole range of pollinators that 
agriculture depends on?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, we have a specific CRP aspect to 
pollinator, which isn't necessarily specific to this budget, 
but it is obviously specific to the Department. There are 
research initiatives that are also focused on pollinator 
health, Utah State. For example, has a fairly significant 
initiative when it comes to pollinators.
    I didn't know that there were like, you know, 4,000 
different kinds of bees in the United States, and 20,000 
internationally, but now I do know that, in part, because of 
their program. So we fund research, and we provide habitat, 
expanded investment in habitat.
    Senator Heinrich. Great. I am going to pass things off to 
the Ranking Member.
    Senator Hoeven. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.

                          DISASTER ASSISTANCE

    A number of things that Senator Tester mentioned, I think 
are really important. I won't go back into them, but the FSA 
staffing is very important obviously. We want to work with you 
to address that. He also emphasized the importance of crop 
insurance and safety net as I did in my opening comment. Do you 
agree that those have to be absolute priorities in the in the 
upcoming Farm Bill?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes.
    Senator Hoeven. Updating those?
    Secretary Vilsack. Yes.
    Senator Hoeven. Okay. The emergency--we put together the 
Wildfires Hurricanes Indemnity Program+ (WHIP+), and then 
utilized it, and then came back, and utilized it again. You 
brought it out and called it Emergency Relief Program (ERP). 
Phase 1 worked very well, we are very pleased with that. Phase 
II, as you know, we weren't quite as pleased with, in terms of 
how you formulated it. My request to you, going forward, is 
that you would work with us if we utilized that WHIP+ Program, 
or as you call it, ERP, and the Livestock Risk Protection 
(LRP), again, I think you did a lot of good, but we would like 
to coordinate with you on how it is implemented, if utilized 
going forward.
    Secretary Vilsack. Do you want me to respond to that, 
Senator?
    Senator Hoeven. Yes.
    Secretary Vilsack. There are three groups of people that we 
are dealing with when it comes to ERP. There is the group that 
has Crop insurance or Noninsured Corp Disaster Assistance 
Program (NAP) coverage, where they have information and data 
that was provided to us and we pre-populated the application, 
tried to reduce the time to get resources satisfied.
    Senator Hoeven. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
    Secretary Vilsack. That is Phase I. Phase II was focused on 
the people that did not have. That there are people that are 
greatest at risk, that don't have any of those protections. Try 
to get them into that system. If there is money left over from 
Phase II, our expectation is to take a look at the other group, 
which is the group that, because of their losses were pretty--
didn't trigger an indemnity under crop insurance, that they 
would then be in a position to be able to receive resources.
    And we are learning from this experience, and I would 
expect and anticipate that we need to look at that in terms of 
this year's ERP Program.
    Senator Hoeven. Yes.
    Secretary Vilsack. Having said that, Senator, there is not 
enough money in that program.
    Senator Hoeven. I know. And that was part of it, which is 
why I registered concerns but left it at that.
    Secretary Vilsack. Okay.
    Senator Hoeven. But no, that is what I hope you would say, 
and that is good. We will work with you going forward. Also I 
think again, as far as that countercyclical safety net that, 
you know, getting that right and crop insurance right, updating 
it like we are talking about, will help diminish the need for 
some of these other disaster assistance programs, so again, 
incredibly important.
    And one of the areas, also, I want to ask about, is the 
Pest Management policies, you know, some of the issues we have 
seen with glyphosate, chlorpyrifos, some of those products that 
our farmers and ranchers have been using for years, and years, 
and years now are being taken off the market. Not necessarily 
through your actions, but through court actions, that can be 
kind of state by state. It is creating a difficult patchwork 
for our producers out there.
    What can we do about that? And it is also creating a lot of 
uncertainty for them. I mean they are they are buying these 
products, and then they can't use them. I mean, it really is 
getting to be an issue that USDA needs to take the leadership 
role in terms of helping our farmers and ranchers from the 
standpoint of understanding what they do, and the certainty 
they need as they run their operations?
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I would say a couple things on 
that. I think, first of all, you are right. We need to be 
making sure that as other agencies of government make decisions 
that could impact and affect producers, that we have done a 
good enough job of educating them about the impact on 
producers. And I am fairly confident that our Pest Management 
folks are doing that at USDA. That they are providing the 
technical, and scientific, and detailed information about the 
impact and effect of what Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
may be considering.
    Then secondly, to the extent that we can work with the 
industry to make sure that as things are restricted in some 
way, that the labeling is what it needs to be, to be able to 
provide clear understanding of when, and under what 
circumstances certain things can, in fact, be used.
    And then third, if there is a way in which our NRCS 
capacities can be used in a way to mitigate the consequences of 
some of this, we ought to be, obviously, directing our 
resources to do so. And I think our research folks also have a 
responsibility to ask the question: Are there ways in which we 
can, if we can't use this, what is the alternative; and we need 
to provide that alternative to our producers through extension?

                 TRANSITIONING NEXT GENERATION FARMERS

    Senator Hoeven. Like-kind exchanges. The average age of a 
farmer nowadays is about 60 years old, which of course I think 
is remarkably young, but for most people 60 years old is, you 
know--we have got to get this next generation into farming. One 
of the tools they use is 1031 like-kind exchanges, and the 
administration has come out proposing limitations on 1031 like-
kind exchanges. But you know the capital barriers to getting 
into production agriculture. We have got to help this next 
generation get into farming; that is an important tool.
    Secretary Vilsack. Well, I would say that that is one of 
the reasons why we have asked for greater flexibility on our 
loan programs, so that we are in a position to help.
    Senator Hoeven. Agreed. Yeah, we need to do more with the 
beginning farmer, and the other loan programs as well. But you 
would agree, those are important tools that our--and that it is 
an important part of transitioning this next generation into 
agriculture.
    Secretary Vilsack. It is Senator, but the reality is that 
there are so many needs, I mean we have to take a look at: 
Where does the resource come from to do all the stuff that we 
want done, that we have all talked about here in this 
committee? And that we are talking about in our budget? I mean, 
it is a balance.
    Senator Hoeven. Yeah. No, I understand. We have to we have 
to figure out good commonsense ways to accomplish it.
    Again, thank you, for being here today; and for your work.
    Secretary Vilsack. You bet.
    Senator Heinrich. Senator Baldwin.
    Senator Baldwin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                  DAIRY BUSINESS INNOVATION INITIATIVE

    Secretary Vilsack, it is great to have you back before the 
committee today. Before I get to my questions, I would like to 
just thank you for prioritizing the Dairy Business Innovation 
Initiative in your budget. In the time since its inclusion in 
the 2018 Farm Bill, millions of have gone to Dairy Producers 
including those in Wisconsin, enabling businesses to expand 
their product lines, and increase their market share.
    These small dollar grants have been incredibly meaningful 
to my state's world-renowned dairy and cheese industry. So we 
appreciate that prioritization.
    Wisconsin dairy farmers have also led the way in 
implementing managed grazing to sustain herds. This practice, 
when done right, can go a long way in improving soil health, 
plant diversity, and water quality. For years, Wisconsin 
grazers and those interested in pursuing managed grazing have 
made it clear to me that the success of their operation is 
significantly improved when they are able to consult a grazing 
expert.
    Specifically a knowledgeable technician who can help 
address the unique needs of their operation, and can save 
farmers valuable time and get them on an expedited path to 
profitability, improved water quality, and climate resilience.

                  GRAZING LANDS CONERVATION INITIATIVE

    I was able to secure funding for the Grazing Lands 
Conservation Initiative in the fiscal years 2022 and 2023. And 
this funding was intended to begin meeting the needs for 
grazing technical assistance for the first time in over a 
decade.
    So Secretary Vilsack, could you share with me the Agency's 
plan to allocate these funds so that technical assistance can 
be made available? But additionally, I would note that funds 
were not included in the fiscal year 2024 Budget, and so I am 
curious to know how the USDA plans to sustain this operation?
    Secretary Vilsack. Senator, I may stand to be corrected in 
the answer I am about to give you. So bear with me if I am 
misstating something. NRCS has basically outlined a variety of 
factors that we want to, basically, invest our conservation 
resources in. And one of them has to do with grazing, and one 
of them has to do with rotational grazing and proper 
management, as part of their climate-smart practices.
    And so I think, from a standpoint of NRCS, we see this as 
kind of already included in the suite of 45 practices that we 
have identified, that we want to target our resources, we want 
to direct IRA resources towards, based on the requests from 
farmers that we get. There is a significant backlog. I suspect 
that there are some producers in Wisconsin that are waiting 
for, they have a plan they are waiting for the resources from 
NRCS. And we are really trying to focus on reducing that 
backlog, and then basically making sure that the EQIP, 
Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), all of those resources 
are effectively invested in climate-smart practices.

             CLIMATE-SMART COMMODITY PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE

    That is in addition to the fact that many Wisconsin 
producers will also be engaged and involved in the Climate-
Smart Commodity Partnership Initiative, and I know that there 
are management practices included in many of the projects that 
we sponsor, and will be sponsoring in Wisconsin. So you will 
also have opportunities within that partnership initiative to 
also see significant investment in those practices.
    Senator Baldwin. Okay. I will certainly want to follow up, 
and be able to track this with some granularity.
    I would like to next ask about Avian Influenza, which has 
contributed to major increases in egg prices this year; the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Line for the 
Emergency Preparedness and Response Initiatives, so a minor 
increase in your budget.
    How will this budget proposal ensure that needs are met to 
fully address the spread of Avian Influenza, including 
providing quarantine and inspection services to producers, and 
funding for state agencies and universities that are conducting 
Avian Influenza testing?
    Secretary Vilsack. This is a great question, and I 
appreciate you raising it. Because it basically allows me to 
indicate that there are a number of tools that we are bringing 
to the HPAI fight, and one of those tools is the Commodity 
Credit Corporation (CCC). So APHIS is receiving additional 
resources from the CCC Fund, which is essentially providing 
resources to allow us to help farmers deal with the detection, 
eradication, and restoration of their facilities.
    And so there is a complement there, as you just can't look 
at the four corners of the budget, you have to look at also the 
additional resources that we are providing.
    In addition, when we basically create resources for 
research there are a number of research projects that involve 
this that are underway at universities at are getting--they 
aren't specifically on a line item, but they are involved, 
potentially, in an AFRI effort.
    We are also meeting with the industry and, you know, I 
think there is more work to be done here in terms of 
encouraging, not just the development of biosecurity plans, but 
the implementation of those plans, our producers, our 
commercial operations have done a much, much, much better job 
than they did in 2014/2015, because we didn't see quite the 
spread from commercial operations that we did.
    But we need to continue to be very vigilant about that, we 
need to take a look at the design of these facilities in terms 
of the transmission, airflow which can potentially complicate 
things. We need to make sure that we continue our research on 
vaccines, with the understanding that we are not there yet, we 
are not even close to being there yet. We don't have a 
commercial operation willing to produce the vaccine, we haven't 
matched it identically to the issue that we have got right now, 
and there are trade complications as a result of the use of 
vaccine.
    So it is really complicated. Some people like to simplify 
it, but it is very, very complicated. So all of that is in the 
budget in various pieces, it may not be specifically identified 
as such, but it is all in the budget.
    Senator Baldwin. Thank you. I yield back.
    Senator Heinrich. I want to thank you, Secretary Vilsack; 
and you Mr. Rapp, for being here today.

                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    Questions for the record are due by next Wednesday, April 
5th, and we would appreciate responses back from USDA within 
the next 30 days.
            Questions Submitted by Senator Dianne Feinstein
              deferred maintenance for research facilities
    Question. Secretary Vilsack, as you may know, a March 2021 study 
found that there is at least $11.5 billion of deferred maintenance for 
university agricultural research facilities nationwide, and that 69 
percent of infrastructure at these facilities is more than 25 years 
old. In Fiscal Year 2023, Congress provided $2 million towards Research 
Facilities Act competitive grants. Absent a sustained Federal effort to 
upgrade aging or obsolete infrastructure, I am concerned that the 
United States' ability to conduct world-leading research will suffer.
    Secretary Vilsack, what actions is the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) currently taking to improve research infrastructure 
and support the next generation of agricultural researchers? How is 
USDA utilizing the $2 million provided by Congress for Research 
Facilities Act grants in Fiscal Year 2023? How should USDA's efforts be 
scaled to better meet the needs of research institutions across the 
country?
    Answer. USDA currently provides research facilities funding through 
multiple programs including the 1890 Facilities Grants Program, the 
Agriculture and Food Sciences Facilities and Equipment Program for 
Insular Areas and, most recently in fiscal year 2023, the Research 
Facilities Act Grant Program (RFAP). Through RFAP, USDA National 
Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) will provide funding to assist 
in the construction, alteration, acquisition, modernization, 
renovation, or remodeling of agricultural research facilities. RFAP 
prioritizes facilities that are located at or primarily benefit 
minority-serving institutions in accordance with the Joint Explanatory 
Statement, which accompanied the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. 
NIFA will host a virtual listening session on April 13, 2023, to 
receive input from stakeholders, customers, and partners that will 
facilitate the development of the Research Facilities Act Program 
Request for Applications (RFA). Once the publication date for the RFA 
is finalized, NIFA will host a technical assistance webinar to provide 
information and assist stakeholders in applying to RFAP.
    NIFA's current research infrastructure programs support both 
fundamental and applied research across diverse institutions serving 
different communities. This investment in research infrastructure 
allows for more institutions, including minority-serving institutions, 
to improve their agricultural research facilities with multiple 
benefits including greater output of cutting- edge research that 
addresses current and future priority issues, improved training of a 
more diverse and well-trained workforce, and enhanced competition with 
global competitors. Among the multiple beneficiaries of investments in 
research facilities are limited resource farmers and ranchers since it 
can help them access new technologies, methods, and knowledge that will 
improve productivity, efficiency, and profitability. Consumers also 
benefit because improved and advanced research facilities can lead to 
the development of new and better products, such as healthier, safer, 
and more sustainable food choices. Finally, investments in research 
facilities can improve opportunities for students to gain firsthand 
experience leading to a better trained workforce in food and 
agricultural sciences. USDA stands ready to scale such efforts to 
better meet the needs of research institutions across the country.
                              labor costs
    Question. Secretary Vilsack, labor costs account for 39 percent of 
the total cash expenses for specialty crop producers, three times more 
than other types of farms. In a report required by the 2018 Farm Bill 
on automation research efforts, USDA found that specialty crop 
automation and mechanization research at Agricultural Marketing 
Service, Agricultural Research Service, and National Institute of Food 
and Agriculture represented 2 percent, 1 percent, and 3 percent of 
specialty crop research funding, respectively, from 2008 through 2018.
    Secretary Vilsack, how can USDA better utilize existing programs to 
support automation and mechanization for specialty crops? Would USDA 
support a new standalone grant program to facilitate the development of 
labor-saving tools and support training and retraining of impacted 
workers?
    Answer. Despite tremendous progress and advances made by existing 
USDA programs to support automation and mechanization for specialty 
crops, there remains a huge unmet need for USDA to expand and 
accelerate its support for the research, development, and use of next 
generation automation, sensors, robotics, and AI-powered (artificial 
intelligence) analytics in the production, harvesting, and processing 
of specialty crops that will result in new labor- and cost- saving 
tools, high-paying technical jobs, and support the training and 
retraining of impacted workers.
    Based on the 2020 report to Congress, ``Developing Automation and 
Mechanization for Specialty Crops: A Review of U.S. Department of 
Agriculture Programs'' prepared by the Economic Research Service, USDA 
has six programs in the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the 
Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and the National Institute of Food 
and Agriculture (NIFA) that, among other objectives, support the 
development and use of automation or mechanization in the production 
and processing of U.S. specialty crops. The programs are: 1) AMS 
Specialty Crop Block Grant Program; 2) ARS Crop Production National 
Program and Product Quality and New Uses National Program; and 3) NIFA 
Specialty Crops Research Initiative (SCRI), Small Business Innovation 
Research (SBIR), and Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI). 
From 2008 to 2018, these programs funded $288 million ($28 million per 
year) toward 213 projects to develop and enhance the use of automation 
or mechanization in specialty crop production and processing. The 
projects included job aid/machinery automation, machine learning/data 
analysis, mechanical harvesting/processing, precision agriculture, 
remote sensing/drones, and sensors, and covered a variety of specialty 
crops (almonds, apples, avocados, beets, blueberries, broccoli, 
cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery, cherries, chestnuts, chickpeas, 
chili peppers, citrus, cranberries, currants, elderberry, table and 
wine grapes, hazelnuts, hops, lettuce, maple syrup, mushrooms, nursery 
crops, olives, onions, ornamentals, pecans, peaches, pears, peas, 
peonies, pistachios, potatoes, pumpkin seeds, raspberries, sod, 
strawberries, sweet corn, sweet potatoes, tea, tomatoes, and walnuts).
    As more data is collected and USDA becomes more informed, resources 
could be used to address climate-smart agriculture of the future, in 
respect to novel scalable implementation of workforce development and 
in leveraging of resilient food systems transitions for broadening 
agricultural workforce participation across all sectors of society and 
ages.
    There is a need for continued support regarding long-term data 
curation and sustainability of automation and mechanization projects, 
databases, and software. However, the focus of many new proposals 
center on novel ideas and tools, rather than continued maintenance and 
update of systems which is needed. USDA's support of open-source 
projects helps encourage collaboration, reduces costs and time 
associated with project initiation and database development, and may 
decrease barriers associated with farmer concerns regarding for-profit 
data collection and use.
    USDA stands ready to implement and support all existing and any new 
programs intended to support the development of labor-saving tools and 
support training and retraining of impacted workers.
                    crop loss from natural disasters
    Question. Since 2018, Congress has appropriated funds four times to 
support producers that experienced crop loss and damage due to natural 
disasters. These supplemental appropriations have included shifting 
requirements for USDA and producers, leading to the creation of several 
programs at USDA-the Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program in 
2017, the Wildfire and Hurricane Indemnity Program Plus in 2018 and 
2019, and the Emergency Relief Program in 2020 and 2021. Although, 
these programs provided much-needed assistance, the changing 
regulations confused producers and delayed payments. Beyond that, the 
impact of disasters can extend beyond the farm and into agricultural 
support industries-like processors-which may be devastated if there are 
no crops planted or harvested.
    Secretary Vilsack, would a permanently authorized disaster program 
modeled on the Emergency Relief Program (ERP) improve USDA's ability to 
quickly disseminate funds to disaster-affected producers following 
supplemental appropriations? How could assistance be extended to 
agribusinesses that also experience significant loss after natural 
disasters?
    Answer. USDA offers subsidized crop insurance, has permanent 
disaster programs, and is working to implement the current ad-hoc 
disaster program that Congress has authorized as a $3.74B disaster 
assistance funding in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (Div. 
N), which supplemented and extended provisions in the Emergency Relief 
Program/Emergency Livestock Relief Program from the Extending 
Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act (Public Law 
117-43) . A permanently authorized disaster program may improve USDA's 
ability to quickly disseminate funds to eligible producers, although 
the full costs and benefits of a permanently authorized disaster 
program are unknown at this time. There is time needed after 
legislation is passed to develop policy and software for program 
implementation; however, after initial program implementation, future 
years can be close to seamless and allow USDA to respond to disasters 
in real-time, when funded.
    Current and past ad-hoc disaster programs are tied to the loss of 
crops; with a 2-year linkage requirement to purchase crop insurance 
where crop insurance is available or Noninsured Crop Disaster 
Assistance Program (NAP) coverage for those commodities for which crop 
insurance is not available.
    Agribusinesses are not eligible for current and past ad-hoc 
disaster programs, nor are they part of the permanent disaster 
programs, as agribusinesses are not the owners or shareholders of the 
crops. However, there are commercial insurance products that 
agribusinesses could choose to option as part of their risk management 
strategies. If Congress were to consider inclusion of agribusinesses it 
would require legislative guidance to change or further clarify the 
definition of loss and/or eligible producer.
                  crop insurance for specialty growers
    Question. Secretary Vilsack, I appreciate USDA's efforts to expand 
access to crop insurance for specialty crop growers, but I remain 
concerned that many growers have inadequate insurance options and are 
forced to rely on policies that only cover catastrophic loss or leave 
significant acreage uncovered.
    Secretary Vilsack, how can USDA improve crop insurance options for 
specialty crop producers, especially those who have historically not 
purchased insurance policies or relied solely on coverage for 
catastrophic losses?
    Answer. Expanding crop insurance to specialty crops and smaller 
farmers is a priority for this Administration. The USDA Risk Management 
Agency (RMA) made tremendous progress on expanding options for 
specialty crop growers, and we know there is still more work to be 
done. We've doubled the eligibility for Whole Farm and tripled the 
eligibility for Micro Farm, which helps smaller farmers.
    We undertook an effort last winter to meet farmers and insurance 
professionals throughout the country to promote Whole Farm and Micro 
Farm. To date, we've had over 8,000 attendees. We've learned a great 
deal and so have the attendees. We hope to use this as a model to 
promote and educate about new products. RMA has a specialty crop 
liaison in every regional office and a national employee devoted to 
this effort. We would be glad to engage and discuss any specific ideas 
your office has on enhancing coverage.
    On the outreach and education front, since 2021, the RMA has 
invested more than $6.4 million in partnerships with 27 entities to 
expand outreach and education on crop insurance, which embodies the 
diversity of agriculture including Hispanic/Latino, Native Americans, 
African American, Beginning, Women, Veteran and Historically 
Underserved farmers, with additional emphasis on those producers who 
are growing and producing specialty crops, livestock, organic-certified 
or transitioning, sustainable/regenerative crops and/or small farms and 
ranches.
                       captive marine mammal care
    Question. Secretary Vilsack, the USDA last updated key elements of 
its standards for the handling and care of captive marine mammals in 
1984, nearly 40 years ago. Since that time, significant progress has 
been made in marine mammal biology and ecology research. You were also 
the Secretary of Agriculture in 2016 under President Obama, when a 
proposed rule was released that would have finally updated these 
standards. Unfortunately, that rule was never finalized, and it was 
withdrawn in 2021 because it was outdated.
    Secretary Vilsack, do you agree that the captive marine mammal 
standards of care are outdated? What efforts is USDA undertaking to 
examine the standards and space requirements of marine mammals?
    Answer. USDA takes the health and welfare of every animal covered 
under the Animal Welfare Act seriously, including marine mammal 
populations. The Animal Welfare Act sets basic standards for humane 
care and treatment that must be provided for certain animals used in 
certain activities. USDA's focus is specific to those marine mammals 
used for public exhibition or biomedical research. Research surrounding 
captive marine mammals continues to evolve, including since the 2016 
proposed rule was drafted. We will review the newly available research, 
as well as consider opportunities to engage with members of the marine 
mammal community, as we consider options for future rule making.

                                 ______
                                 

              Questions Submitted by Senator Tammy Baldwin
               regional conservation partnership program
    Question. The Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) has 
shown significant promise as a flexible and partner driven conservation 
program but has had a troubled implementation and rollout since the 
2018 Farm Bill. Given the U.S. Department of Agriculture's wide 
discretion in implementing this program, what steps has the agency 
taken to improve RCPP implementation? In particular, how is the agency: 
reducing paperwork burdens; ensuring efficient easement appraisal 
processes; streamlining easement and land management project 
implementation; and ensuring sufficient and consistent agency 
staffing--both at NRCS Headquarters and in State offices--to guarantee 
that Federal funds and partner resources are effectively delivered to 
America's farmers?
    Answer. The USDA National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) is 
evaluating the flexibilities to ensure appropriate use of RCPP funding, 
while listening to the challenges of our customers. We are leaning in 
on certified entities for easement transactions and internal training 
of our RCPP coordinators to ensure consistent interpretations of 
policies and procedures for success. We expect to make an initial 
public announcement in Spring of 2023 on the first set of flexibilities 
and are working towards additional improvements and efficiencies.
                   conservation technical assistance
    Question. The Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) has the 
ability to use Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) funding to hire 
grazing technicians across the country, both within NRCS and at third 
party organizations, via the Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative 
(GLCI). With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), more CTA 
funding is available to NRCS than ever before, making now an ideal time 
to ensure dedicated funding for GCLI. Yet the recent President's Budget 
Request notes USDA's intention to spend $0 through GLCI in FY24. Why is 
USDA opting to withhold funding that could support access to grazing 
technicians for producers across the country?
    Answer. NRCS continues to prioritize hiring and focus on 
recruitment and retention of qualified technical staff. We are 
increasing staffing numbers and working with Land Grant Universities 
and other institutions to produce USDA qualified applicants, including 
grazing technicians. We are also seeking opportunities to partner with 
other technical organizations and agencies to onboard staff.
                    conservation stewardship program
    Question. Secretary Vilsack noted during the March 29th Senate 
Appropriations subcommittee hearing on Agriculture, Rural Development, 
food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, that IRA spending 
within the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and the Environmental 
Stewardship Program (EQIP) will be used to contract with producers 
implementing sustainable grazing practices already available within 
each program. However, contracting with a producer to implement a 
practice does not guarantee that that practices will create an overall 
benefit for farm, and targeted technical assistance is often needed to 
ensure practices have both an environmental benefit and an agronomic 
benefit. When both are realized, producers are more likely to maintain 
and improve upon practices over the long term. Given the importance of 
technical assistance in ensuring the success of sustainable grazing 
practices on farms, why hasn't USDA committed to ensuring that 
increased GLCI funding accompanies IRA spending in CSP and EQIP, 
helping to provide increased grazing TA simultaneously with increased 
funding for practice implementation?
    Answer. The USDA National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) is 
committed to this work and continues to seek out qualified applicants 
to join the technical teams across the country in our field offices. 
Grazing lands are a key component of soil health and climate solutions. 
Using a systems approach to addressing climate smart resource concerns 
and the co-benefits of a grazing system are a primary focus of the 
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) implementation.
                     business and industry program
    Question. Last year, USDA proposed--and the Committees accepted--an 
interchange in budget authority that increased the lending authority of 
the Business and Industry Program. The program, again, faces a shortage 
of loan authority. Of the loans that have currently been obligated and 
the dollar value of those in the pipeline, there will be a deficit in 
the program in excess of $250 million. To avoid the denial of qualified 
loans, would the agency consider supporting another interchange of 
unobligated funds to enable lending in the Business and Industry 
Program?
    Answer. The Department is exploring options for continuing support 
of the Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan program above the level 
that Congress provided in order to meet demand. An interchange of 
unobligated funds is one of the options but in the interim the 
Department continues making any funding available from this program's 
recoveries.

               Questions Submitted by Senator Joe Manchin
                          usda staffing needs
    Question. Is the Department of Agriculture able to adequately meet 
its staffing needs and is the agency able to fill key positions with 
qualified employees?
    Answer. The Department is working diligently to maximize the 
effectiveness of the funding provided by Congress to meet our staffing 
needs across the country. At this time, yes, the Department believes 
that we are able to adequately meet our staffing needs. Our leadership 
team continues to look closely at staffing needs as they arise, whether 
within a headquarters unit or in a field office, to ensure that our 
staffing resources are ultimately aligned to address the needs of 
USDA's customers.
    Question. Related, what percentage of USDA employees are back in 
the office full time nationwide?
    Answer. Throughout the public health emergency, tens of thousands 
of USDA employees continued to work in-person to meet the Nation's 
needs for critical public services such as meat and poultry inspections 
and wildland firefighting. As the Department continues to analyze the 
data and evidence, we are focused on ensuring that our customers 
continue to get the support necessary from our workforce to meet their 
expectations and to meet their daily needs for support from USDA. When 
the Department concludes its analysis and finalizes its plans for 
maximizing the customer experience, we will share that information with 
you and the Committee.
           difficult terrain and access to urban area project
    Question. The USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) has been working 
on the ``Difficult Terrain and Access to Urban Area'' project. This 
project was started in 2021, and as of 2023 my office has not seen the 
Phase I published report, due to ``unanticipated delays''. Can you 
provide an update on the status and publication of this project? Will 
the ERS commit to visiting West Virginia to better understand our 
mountainous and difficult terrain areas?
    Answer. Yes, USDA is committed to visiting West Virginia to gain 
greater insights into the mountainous and difficult terrain areas. The 
ERS researchers are in the process of incorporating comments and 
conducting additional analysis of the data based on the comments on the 
peer review manuscript. In addition, ERS met with the Federal Office of 
Rural Health Policy in February to discuss the progress of this 
project. ERS plans on providing the office with the data needed for the 
next cycle of grant announcements. USDA is on track to publish the 
report by this summer.
                         broadband coordination
    Question. With tens of billions in Federal funding directed to 
broadband in the last 5 years, how is USDA coordinating with other 
broadband deployment programs--such as those administered by the FCC, 
NTIA, and Treasury?
    Answer. USDA meets regularly and on an ad hoc basis with the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the U.S. 
Treasury to ensure that Federal dollars are spent in the most efficient 
way possible. Additionally, USDA shares information with our Federal 
partners regarding the awards made under our programs to enable other 
agencies to take those awards into consideration to ensure projects do 
not overlap or overbuild existing services already made available.

            Questions Submitted by Senator Susan M. Collins
             remote work and upgrades to usda headquarters
    Question. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many Federal employees were 
given the opportunity to work from home. While most have returned to 
the office, it is my understanding that many USDA employees are now 
permanently working from home with no intention to return. What is your 
plan for the South Building and to return staffing in the building to 
pre- pandemic levels so that taxpayers aren't asked to fund 
refurbishment of empty workspace?
    The FY2024 budget proposes an increase of $84 M for Agriculture 
Buildings and Facilities, $46.8 M of which is specifically designated 
for modernization of the USDA South Building. The USDA South Building 
modification has been an ongoing endeavor since well before the 
pandemic. The Committee has requested a plan for how these funds will 
be used and prioritized, and we have yet to see one.
    Answer. The Department recently submitted its response to OMB-M-23-
15, the next step in reviewing USDA's Future of Work policies while 
maintaining laser focus on service delivery. USDA has been on a journey 
to modernize and transform our culture and workplace to become one of 
the ``Best Places to Work in the Federal Government.'' A core value of 
our Future of Work approach is the importance of making data-driven 
decisions and ensuring our employees have a voice in the policies that 
impact their lives. We are committed to continuing to refine 
performance measures and benchmarks, use data to ensure we have a 
warning system in place to alert us if performance starts to wane under 
the current policies, and have data that will give the Department a 
better chance to make any telework policy changes without causing any 
drastic short-term performance and morale losses.
    The South Building is a critical component of the Department's real 
property portfolio in the National Capital Region (NCR) and is home to 
the headquarters for many of the Department's program agencies and 
staff offices. The building, originally built in the 1930s, still 
includes many original systems which have been well maintained but the 
building has only been partially upgraded in recent years. A continued 
investment in the renovation of the South Building will enable the 
Department to address significant life and health safety challenges 
that exist throughout the facility due to the relative age of the 
structure and systems. These renovations will also create opportunities 
for the Department to make strategic decisions on the continued use of 
leased facilities throughout the NCR. Without continued investments in 
building modernization, the Department will likely need to maintain a 
significant portfolio of leased facilities in the NCR that cost over 
$10 million per year in rental payments.

                                 ______
                                 

               Questions Submitted by Senator Jerry Moran
                      international market access
    Question. As major exporters of beef, wheat, and oil seed, Kansas 
farmers know how crucial international market access is to their 
prosperity. The Department's budget request also recognizes foreign 
trade as essential for the vitality of the U.S. agricultural industry.
    However, I'm increasingly concerned that the Biden Administration 
is instead opting out of free trade agreements that facilitate 
agricultural exports in favor of loosely-defined frameworks that do not 
benefit our farmers.
    How does USDA reconcile the importance of agricultural trade with 
the administration's opposition to pursuing free trade agreements?
    Answer. USDA is working alongside the United States Trade 
Representative (USTR) within the parameters of the Biden Administration 
to advance trade policy. One challenge that USDA and USTR currently 
face is to build trust in this country on trade. USDA and USTR must, 
therefore, work to secure wins by creating new or expanded market 
access, enforcing existing agreements, and restoring trust in trade. 
There are a multitude of ways in which USDA is making a difference in 
terms of trade without necessarily focusing solely on free trade 
agreements. We must continue to expand trade missions, provide support 
to foreign market development programs that help drive exports, and 
always look for opportunities to break down barriers to trade.
    We will therefore continue to work with USTR, the Department of 
Commerce, and other U.S. government partners on the U.S.-Kenya 
Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP), the 21st Century 
Taiwan Trade Initiative, and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for 
Prosperity (IPEF). The IPEF, for instance, can serve to increase U.S. 
agricultural exports to an area of the world where both the middle 
class and the demand for high-quality, trusted, sustainably produced 
agricultural products are growing. The IPEF Trade Pillar seeks to 
emphasize agricultural sustainability and agricultural biotechnology, 
enhancing agricultural supply chain resilience, improving transparency 
on regulatory measures, and promoting science- based decision-making to 
protect human, animal, and plant life. In doing so, markets can be 
created or opened to the type of high-quality, high-value products our 
farmers, ranchers, and producers are already producing.
    USDA has also sponsored numerous Agribusiness Trade Missions 
(ATMs). In calendar year (CY) 2022, ATMs provided small and medium-
sized U.S. exporters opportunities in markets including the United Arab 
Emirates, United Kingdom, Philippines, Kenya, Tanzania, Spain, and 
Portugal. During these missions, participants engaged directly with 
potential buyers, resulting in a total of 125 U.S. agribusinesses 
participating in 1,310 business-to-business meetings reporting $42.2 
million in 12-month projected sales. Our work to expand ATMs provides 
U.S. exporters with additional opportunities to increase their market 
presence overseas and generate sales, while providing senior-level USDA 
officials with a platform to advance U.S. agricultural trade priorities 
directly with foreign counterparts. Regarding CY 2023, USDA has 
executed or is in the process of executing trade missions to Panama, 
the Netherlands, Japan, Chile, Malaysia, and Angola.
    The United States continues to implement agricultural trade 
policies in a manner consistent with its free trade agreement 
obligations and expects our trading partners to do the same while 
working to maintain open and predictable markets for American farmers 
and producers. Policy discussions with the European Union (EU) on 
several agricultural trade issues are ongoing to address market access 
issues such as overly restrictive maximum residue levels (MRL), 
unpredictable animal health certificate policies, lack of recognition 
of common food names, and deforestation-free supply chain regulations, 
to name a few.
    Additionally, USDA continues to work in close coordination with 
USTR on dispute settlement efforts regarding Canada's tariff-rate quota 
allocation measures for dairy products under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement (USMCA). The United States' priority remains ensuring that 
U.S. workers, processors, farmers, and exporters benefit from the 
market access Canada committed to through the USMCA. USDA and USTR also 
continue to engage with Mexican officials at all levels to convey our 
serious concerns about Mexico's treatment of agricultural 
biotechnology. It is critical that Mexico fully complies with its USMCA 
commitments and that it returns to a science- and risk-based regulatory 
approach for all biotech products. Mexico is a valued trading partner, 
and USDA is committed to working with it to resolve these biotech 
issues and avoid any disruption of trade in corn or other agricultural 
products.
    Specifically for beef, tariff reductions that came about under the 
U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement that went into effect in 2020 have helped 
the United States become Japan's top beef supplier for the first time 
in more than two decades. The revision of the beef safeguard, 
negotiated in 2022, will ensure that U.S. beef exports to Japan can 
continue to grow. For soybeans, the U.S. exported a record $33.3 
billion in product in 2022, and we will continue to fight any barriers 
that impede their export to global markets.
    USDA advocates for U.S. agriculture around the world through 
diverse mechanisms to secure tariff reductions, improve the environment 
for exporting U.S. agricultural products, and increase predictability 
and transparency in trade regulation. Under this administration, USDA 
engagement was critical to delivering roughly $15 billion in new or 
preserved market access through active policy intervention with foreign 
governments. By leveraging creative trade policy tools, and working in 
concert with USTR, USDA remains committed to making significant gains 
and expanding market access for farmers and ranchers throughout the 
United States.
                          reconnect deployment
    Question. Secretary Vilsack, the FY2024 budget requests another 
$400 million for the ReConnect broadband deployment program. With more 
than $175 billion in Federal funding directed to broadband in the last 
5 years, I am concerned about keeping this program focused on unserved 
areas in rural America and ensuring Federal broadband deployment 
resources are efficiently utilized.
    Does the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that USDA, NTIA, FCC, 
and Treasury signed in May 2022 ensure that ReConnect funds will not 
duplicate other Federal broadband deployment investments?
    Answer. USDA meets regularly and on an ad hoc basis with the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and the U.S. 
Treasury to ensure that Federal dollars are spent in the most efficient 
way possible. Under the Memorandum of Understanding that is in place, 
USDA shares information with our Federal partners regarding the awards 
made under our programs to enable other agencies to take those awards 
into consideration to ensure projects do not overlap or overbuild 
existing services already made available.
    Question. If not, what more needs to be done to ensure Federal 
funds are not being duplicated, while unserved areas still exist?
    Answer. The MOU signed in May 2022 is helping to ensure that 
duplication will not occur.
                   farm service agency loan officers
    Question. Secretary Vilsack, as you are aware, USDA Farm Service 
Agency staff performs a crucial role in facilitating the investments in 
our agricultural communities and the rural towns they support we 
advocate for. My understanding is that about 40 percent of the FSA loan 
officers are retirement eligible in the next 5 years and that it takes 
2 years to train a new loan officer.
    What steps is the department taking to recruit and retain loan 
officers?
    Answer. The USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) continues to be 
challenged in the recruitment and retention of employees. In Farm Loan 
Programs, for example, 42 percent of loan officers and supervisors are 
eligible for retirement between now and fiscal year 2027. In addition 
to attrition through retirements, challenges include hiring and 
retaining new staff due to Federal pay scales that are not competitive 
with the private sector, high workload demands, and business processes 
that are manual and paper based compared to other financial industry 
employers.
    FSA has taken several steps to address these challenges and to 
recruit and retain Loan Officers. Over the last couple of years, FSA 
has increased use of the Pathways Program to bring college students and 
recent graduates into the Agency, as well as increasing use of the 1890 
Scholars Program and other internship programs. FSA has modified the 
required experience for the Loan Officer positions to include not only 
FSA loan approval authority but also private sector agricultural loan 
experience, thus expanding the Agency's recruitment reach. FSA is also 
encouraging States to make more use of the Loan Analyst position; loan 
analysts complete the first year of the Farm Loan Officer Training 
program, building a workforce that is readily available to step into 
the Loan Officer role more quickly.
    FSA has also increased utilization of recruitment, relocation, and 
retention incentives for farm loan employees. In fiscal Year 2022, FSA 
issued over $620,000 in student loan repayments to 69 farm loan 
employees. In exchange for receiving loan repayments, employees signed 
a 3-year service agreement. FSA plans to utilize student loan 
repayments for these series again in fiscal Year 2023. In addition, 
since February 2022, FSA has approved 38 relocation and recruitment 
incentives in these series. FSA continues to explore all options to 
improve recruitment and retention.
    Question. For example, will you be seeking direct hiring authority 
from the Office of Personnel Management for these critical positions?
    Answer. The FSA is looking at leveraging various authorities that 
exist including OPM waivers for direct hire authority.
                       select agent registration
    Question. Can you please provide an update on the status of the 
select agent registration activities including a program schedule, it 
is my understanding that this is currently running slightly behind the 
initial planned schedule.
    Answer. Delays in facility construction, commissioning schedule, 
and receipt of commissioning documents have impacted our initial Select 
Agent Registration schedule, yet personnel at the National Bio and 
Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) have been proactive in the registration 
process and have been working with the Federal Select Agent Program 
(FSAP) on registration and approval for all activities with Select 
Agents necessary to transfer the mission from the Plum Island Animal 
Disease Center (PIADC) to NBAF.
    NBAF personnel are in constant contact with FSAP regarding document 
submission and are coordinating with FSAP on planning inspection dates, 
with the goal of having a first inspection in Fall 2023.
    NBAF and USDA leadership have developed a tiered science transition 
strategy, to begin laboratory work with non-infectious materials, 
progressing to low risk agents, and then eventual work with Select 
Agents after full FSAP approval is received. They will not work with 
any Select Agents until approved by the FSAP. The goal of completing 
full registration of the facility by Fall 2024, pending any unforeseen 
circumstances, remains the same.
    Question. Please provide a crosswalk of the funds in the budget 
request for NBAF and related science at both ARS and APHIS.
    Answer. The fiscal year 2024 President's budget requested an 
increase of $23.9 million over the fiscal Year 2023 enacted level. This 
proposed increase consists of $13 million in operations for contracts 
(facilities, security, supplies, and services), an additional $10.6 
million for capital improvements in the USDA Agricultural Research 
Service (ARS) Buildings and facilities account, and an increase of $300 
thousand to cover the anticipated increase in pay costs. There is no 
change in the proposed research and science budgets at ARS or the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).
    Question. Please explain USDA's plan to obtain sufficient BSL-2 
space needed to house animals prior to the beginning of a specific 
experiment. If additional funds were provided in FY24 to address these 
needs, please provide budget details for funds would be executed.
    Answer. While we recognize that BSL-2 space at NBAF is limited, 
there are no current plans for expanding animal holding capacity.
                 collaboration with university partners
    Question. If additional funds were available in FY24 to enhance 
collaboration with university partners, what would be most helpful in 
either equipment or curriculum development to make enduring progress on 
the important educating and training students for the future workforce?
    Answer. The partnership and workforce development funds provided 
have enabled considerable education and training initiatives for USDA 
ARS and APHIS to meet their specific mission needs. Additional 
investment in the NBAF Agrosecurity Partnerships for Innovative 
Research (ASPIRE) program would further strengthen the framework by 
which NBAF will enhance America's agricultural biosecurity by forming 
strategic partnerships with universities, industry, and other Federal 
agencies to support the NBAF Strategic Plan and National Biodefense 
Strategy.
    Through ASPIRE, USDA is partnering with the Research Corporation 
for Science Advancement (RCSA) to launch a Scialog, pairing ``science 
and dialogue'' around fundamental scientific challenges, on Mitigating 
Zoonotic Threats. The Scialog fellows include around 50 early career 
faculty and scientists from across the U.S. with varied disciplinary 
expertise who work together for over 3 years to innovate around current 
best ideas and build an innovation network that will extend over the 
next 30+ years of their careers. ARS and APHIS have several of their 
early career scientists within this cohort.
    Other key partnerships include the Research Alliance for Veterinary 
Science and Biodefense BSL-3 Network 'RAV3N' funded by USDA, which is a 
collaborative community of 18 U.S. academic and Federal institutions. 
The Network aims to establish strategic and coordinated approaches for 
collective large-animal biocontainment infrastructure and science 
capacity to improve bio-surveillance, diagnostics, and countermeasure 
developments against high- consequence pathogens of veterinary 
importance.
    Recognizing the competitiveness of the workplace for research, 
diagnostic, and operational staff for high containment facilities, USDA 
has developed programs to help supply the scientific and operational 
pipeline and provide awareness of career opportunities at NBAF. For 
example, ARS has trained more than 20 students from 5 different 
universities and trained an additional 18 post-docs. In fiscal Year 
2022, a new partnership was established with Indiana University of 
Pennsylvania to create a biosafety certificate program to increase the 
workforce pipeline for work in high containment facilities. APHIS is 
developing the next generation of subject matter experts and laboratory 
staff at NBAF through its NBAF Scientist Training Program (NSTP) and 
the NBAF Laboratorian Training Program (NLTP). The NSTP has supported 
26 students from 15 universities with 10 now transferred to permanent 
Federal positions at NBAF and already contributing to science 
transition planning. The NLTP has trained 39 undergraduate students 
between programs at Kansas State University and Texas Tech University 
and will continue to do so.
    Question. If additional funds were available in FY24, what 
activities and in what amount would be useful to the Department's 
future plan to house a Biologics Development Module at NBAF? Are there 
opportunities for university partners to contribute to the production 
of standardized biological reagents?
    Answer. The Biologics Development Module (BDM) has filled several 
key positions and is developing a prioritization of projects to begin 
as the facility comes online. USDA will hold a BDM Stakeholder meeting 
on June 21-22, 2023, in Manhattan, Kansas. A primary goal for this 
meeting is to identify key contacts among industry, academia, and other 
Federal agencies who will be instrumental in successfully establishing 
collaborations and partnerships with the BDM. In addition, USDA will 
introduce stakeholders to the BDM personnel and describe its 
capabilities and solicit feedback from stakeholders regarding past 
experience with public private partnerships and lessons learned, and 
the potential to partner with universities on the production of 
standardized biological reagents.

               Questions Submitted by Senator Deb Fischer
                       unobligated covid funding
    Question. The President has stated that the pandemic is over, and 
the National emergency is set to end in May. Since 2020, USDA has 
received billions of dollars through the CARES Act, the Consolidated 
Appropriations of '21, and the American Rescue Plan Act to administer 
as emergency assistance, to help farmers and ranchers, consumers and 
rural communities withstand the impacts of the pandemic.
    Can you provide to this subcommittee an accounting of the funds 
that remain unobligated and unspent under these authorities?
    Answer. USDA submits a monthly accounting of the funds that remain 
unobligated and unspent under funding received through the CARES Act, 
the Consolidated Appropriations of 2021, and the American Rescue Plan 
Act to administer as emergency assistance, to help farmers and 
ranchers, consumers, and rural communities withstand the impacts of the 
pandemic. The latest report was sent March 14, 2023.
                               reconnect
    Question. Can you provide the subcommittee with the latest outlays 
for ReConnect from the funding included in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law?
    Answer. USDA is working diligently to expedite all funding made 
available under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The agency has 
already awarded over $540 million in funds under our 3rd funding window 
and we are on-track to obligate the remaining ReConnect funding under 
our 4th window and expect to obligate approximately $1.9 billion in 
awards by leveraging both loan and grant funding. As of today, there 
have not been any outlays, but Rural Development expects that outlays 
will begin this fiscal year and continue in the next 7 years, in line 
with the normal outlay patterns for the program.
    Question. Would you be able to clarify your position about the 
program's goal, and whether you feel it should help unserved Americans 
without any broadband access in rural America?
    Answer. The ReConnect Program is focused on extending affordable, 
reliable high-speed broadband service in rural unserved and underserved 
communities. Priority is given to unserved communities, but the program 
does make funding available to eligible underserved communities as 
well.
                       water quality and quantity
    Question. The legislative text of IRA departed from the resource 
concerns agreed to in the bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill and restricted 
those funds use to address ``improving soil carbon, reducing nitrogen 
losses or to reduce, capture, avoid, or sequester carbon dioxide, 
methane, or nitrous oxide emissions, associated with agricultural 
production.'' Water quantity and water quality remain top local 
resource concerns in Nebraska. How will USDA interpret the restriction 
placed on IRA conservation funds?
    For example, how will USDA look at a producer wanting to use EQIP 
cost share funding to upgrade their irrigation pivot to optimize water 
use? Would they be at a disadvantage with IRA funding?
    Answer. Investments from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are 
investments to help farmers, ranchers, and forest owners implement new 
or additional conservation activities on their lands, with a focus on 
Climate-Smart mitigation activities that can increase storage of carbon 
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and may also help to address 
drought and other climate-related stressors. We realize that 
conservation practices build upon each other, and the solutions include 
co-benefits. Applicants who want to address resource concerns related 
to climate smart agriculture and forestry are able to apply for all 
conservation programs regardless of funding source. State Technical 
Committees provide the guidance to the State Conservationist for 
funding priorities. In addition, NRCS recently announced the Western 
Water and Working Land Framework, of which Nebraska is included in the 
17 States. In the Framework, NRCS identifies six major water and land 
resource management challenges, guidelines for identifying vulnerable 
agricultural landscapes and 13 strategies for NRCS leaders in western 
States to use now to collaborate with partners, water resource managers 
and producers. The goal is to help secure clean and available water 
supplies, healthy soils, resilient landscapes, and thriving 
agricultural communities, now and in the future.
    Question. The IRA also removed a Farm Bill requirement that 50 
percent of EQIP funds are used for livestock production. Without that 
requirement, does USDA anticipate a significant shift in the 
distribution of EQIP funds?
    Answer. Livestock production will continue to be a significant 
piece of NRCS Farm Bill Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) 
distribution based on locally driven priority resource concerns. While 
IRA does not require a minimum, we continue to use EQIP Farm Bill funds 
with the 50 percent requirement.
                         precision agriculture
    Question. As you know our Nation is at a critical juncture in 
advancing precision agriculture technology and related artificial 
intelligence. To ensure producers have access to safe digital tools to 
guide and enhance management and production options, Congress provided 
US Department of Agriculture (UDSA) Agriculture Research Service with 
the initial planning funding to co-locate and establish a national 
center for resilient and regenerative precision agriculture in Lincoln 
at the Nebraska Innovation Campus. This facility is envisioned to serve 
as the anchor of a national network comprised of USDA and land-grant 
universities and their Cooperative Extension arms to equip America's 
farmers and ranchers with 21st century precision technologies to meet 
present-day and future challenges.
    Can you provide the Committee with an update on steps USDA taken to 
help expedite planning surrounding the implementation of initial 
funding provided by Congress and support moving forward?
    Answer. The strategic plan for the new National Center for 
Resilient and Regenerative Precision Agriculture (NCRRPA) will more 
than double ARS personnel at the location, expand research capacity, 
catalyze collaborations with University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), and 
add new Agricultural Research Service (ARS) buildings to the existing 
ARS presence in Lincoln. The project is progressing. There will be two 
construction projects: one is a new headhouse and greenhouse (HH/GH) 
and one is a new lab/office building (LOB). ARS currently has $11.2 
million appropriated for planning and design and $20 million for 
construction. ARS is actively planning and designing both buildings and 
will build the HH/GH first with funds already appropriated. The 
Architect and Engineering firm submitted the Program of Requirement for 
ARS review in December 2022. In March 2023, the 35 percent design for 
the LOB was provided to ARS. USDA ARS will adapt the HH/GH space into a 
Plant Growth Facility that will be a hybrid HH/GH plus grow house. 
Integrating a climate-controlled grow house reduces overall operating 
costs to meet current and future research mission needs. The hybrid 
Plant Growth Facility will still occupy 25,140 square feet and follows 
the Nebraska Innovation Campus building guidelines.
    Question. What research and technology gaps has USDA identified 
that could be addressed by a National Center for Regenerative Precision 
Agriculture for the development of enhanced digital tools to meet 
president day and future challenges?
    Answer. A key priority for the National Center for Regenerative 
Precision Agriculture (NCRPA) will be to develop and enable precision 
agriculture for producers of all sizes, of all crop and livestock 
systems, and in all parts of the U.S. Since data drives precision 
agriculture, this will require Big Data and High-Performance Computing 
capacity as well as data capture, integration and standardization 
efficiencies. USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has worked to 
identify key data, infrastructure and technology gaps that are 
bottlenecks to providing all producers with meaningful and helpful 
precision agriculture tools and capacity.
    As part of this, ARS has allocated most of the funding appropriated 
in fiscal year 2023 for Measurement and Monitoring Innovation to 
strategically catalyze innovation in sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) 
technologies and data capture, automation, standardization and 
integration. In deploying these funds to a new project in Lincoln, ARS 
has directed the team there to establish collaborations with UNL around 
data integration and with North Dakota State University around sensor, 
electronics and computer engineering and design. In addition to these 
strategic new collaborations, the project will seek to link well 
aligned sensor, IoT and data integration research efforts at other ARS 
research locations (including Clay Center, Nebraska; Stillwater, 
Oklahoma; Mandan, North Dakota; Fort Collins, Colorado; Beltsville, 
Maryland; Mississippi State, Mississippi; Columbia, Missouri; and 
others) and university collaborators (including University of Nebraska-
Lincoln, North Dakota State University, Colorado State University, 
Oklahoma State University, University of Missouri, North Carolina State 
University, and others).
    Additionally, the fiscal Year 2024 President's Budget includes, as 
part of the ARS Climate Science request, the creation of a focused and 
coordinated climate change adaptation and mitigation modeling, data 
management and tool development project that serves as an ARS center of 
excellence to strengthen and support research across ARS and regional 
engagement of the Climate Hubs. If funded, this new Climate Science 
center of excellence will likely be located at NCRRPA and will increase 
the impact of ARS climate change mitigation and adaptation research 
efforts such as Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR), Breeding 
Insights, ARS Grand Challenges Synergies, and others. This new project 
will catalyze a data-driven and precision agriculture focus on climate 
change adaptation and mitigation. It will support and enhance other 
precision agriculture efforts already underway at ARS as well as the 
new precision livestock management effort at nearby Clay Center, 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln and other locations. Building on the 
current collaborations and common research framework of LTAR, the 
Climate Hubs, and others, these funds will increase focus specifically 
on climate smart practices, data, tools, and technologies that are 
relevant both regionally and nationally, and that can lead to 
greenhouse gas mitigation, producer participation in carbon and 
ecosystem markets, resilience to weather extremes, and adaptation to 
regional expected climatic conditions of the future. The effort will 
leverage ARS's Partnerships for Data Innovations, SciNet infrastructure 
for Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning processing 
and analytics, Life Cycle Analysis and strengthen data and modeling 
collaborations with other Agencies and Departments such as the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, and the Department of the Interior.
    Question. Outside of funding, are there any barriers that would 
hinder the construction and establishment of the proposed ARS co-
located facility?
    Answer. ARS notes that significant progress is being made and no 
other significant barriers have been identified at this time.
                            extreme drought
    Question. The extreme drought that persists across the western U.S. 
and shows signs of intensifying has wreaked havoc on farming 
communities, towns, and municipalities across the Western U.S. and some 
areas east of the Mississippi. One essential tool that USDA and U.S. 
agriculture producers have benefited from since 1999 is the U.S. 
Drought Monitor (USDM), produced weekly by the National Drought 
Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. Can 
USDA provide the Committee with the current USDA programs and other 
Federal and State agencies that use the USDM and early warning science-
based NDMC products to inform drought-related decisions?
    Answer. While USDA cannot speak to USDM usage by other Federal 
agencies, several States have official drought plans incorporating 
information provided by the NDMC, including the weekly USDM map and 
associated statistics. These plans can be found here: https://
drought.unl.edu/planning/DroughtPlans/StatePlans.aspx.
    Congress has also mandated its use as a trigger for the Livestock 
Forage Disaster Program in the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 
2008. Other USDA programs that use the USDM as a determinant of 
eligibility are:

  --The Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm Raised 
        Fish Program;

  --Fast Track USDA Disaster Designations;

  --Emergency Farm Loans; and

  --Emergency Haying and Grazing under the Conservation Reserve 
        Program.

    A summary of these and other programs providing relief from drought 
and other natural disasters is here: https://www.farmers.gov/sites/
default/files/2021-10/fsa-usdroughtmonitor- factsheet-21-101521.pdf.
                        pork processing capacity
    Question. I am glad the Department avoided a lapse in the NSIS 
time-limited trial and subsequent loss in pork processing capacity this 
spring. I appreciate the efforts you have taken to make gains in meat 
and poultry processing capacity. I'd urge you to establish the NSIS 
which allows plants to process hogs at the higher line speed 
permanently. These plants have been operating in this way for decades 
now, safely and efficiently. Do you agree we need a permanent solution 
to ensuring pork line speed? Can you share with us the timing and 
process for re- establishing this program permanently?
    Answer. FSIS has contracted with a team of worker safety experts to 
study the impact of increased line speeds on worker safety at poultry 
establishments. The agency was able to expand the contract to include 
swine establishments. In early March 2023, FSIS announced that it was 
extending the duration of the swine ``Time-Limited Trials'' (TLT's) 
until November 30, 2023. This extension will allow the contractors to 
finalize their report on the swine establishments data, enable the 
agency to assess the report's findings and conclusions, and to 
determine future actions, including a potential rulemaking on line 
speed.
    Question. Are there funding needs from the Department to ensure a 
permanent program?
    Answer. There are no additional funding needs at this time.

STATEMENT OF HON. DR. ROBERT CALIFF, M.D., COMMISSIONER

              OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR MARTIN HEINRICH

    Senator Heinrich. Good afternoon. This hearing of the 
Agricultural Appropriations Subcommittee is now called to 
order, and I'd like to begin by welcoming FDA Commissioner Dr. 
Robert Califf to this hearing. Thank you for being here today. 
Very much looking forward to discussing the fiscal year 2024 
Budget Request for the Food and Drug Administration.
    The responsibilities of the FDA are extensive and they 
impact every single American. Last year this committee provided 
historic funding for this agency but there is much more work 
that needs to be done and that begins with the budget request 
in front of us today.
    This request for FDA includes the discretionary increase of 
$372 million. This increase touches on a wide array of 
activities at the FDA, from enhancing food safety to advancing 
safe and effective medical products as well as continuing to 
address the ongoing Opioid crisis.
    We must ensure that the vast number of products FDA 
regulates are safe while also not slowing down important 
advancements in research and technology. These are not easy 
tasks, but this committee stands ready to work to support the 
FDA and the critical work that is done there.
    The decisions the FDA makes, whether approving a medical 
device or approving a new drug, must be guided by science and 
data, not by political pressure.
    Dr. Califf, with your long and distinguished career in 
science, I suspect you must feel the same way and that 
precisely is why a recent decision by a Federal judge in Texas 
is so disturbing to me.
    This judge has replaced his political agenda for the data-
driven process used by the FDA. He has undermined the FDA's 
safety and efficacy determination of Mifepristone and with it 
he has undermined the FDA's authority to determine the safety 
and efficacy of all medications, from insulin to cancer 
treatments.
    I know we're going to discuss this shortly and I'm 
interested to hear your thoughts, Dr. Califf, but first I look 
forward to hearing your testimony and having a robust 
discussion on this year's budget request, and I'll now turn the 
time over to Ranking Member Hoeven for any opening statements 
that he may have.
    Thank you, Member Hoeven.

                    STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN HOEVEN

    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Chairman Heinrich, appreciate 
it.
    I'm also pleased that our Ranking Member for the Full 
Appropriations Committee, Senator Collins, is here. Thanks for 
joining us, appreciate it very much, and, Dr. Califf, thanks 
for being here, appreciate it very much.
    Last year when you returned to reprise your role as 
Commissioner, we were at the beginning stages of the infant 
formula crisis. During both the budget hearing and subsequent 
food safety hearing, we had frank discussions on the need for 
sustained leadership in the agency, and I expressed to you at 
that time, you know, that we had seven commissioners in the 
past decade and that we need some stability in the FDA. I'm 
pleased that you're back and I know you're working hard to try 
to provide that stability. I think it's important and I 
appreciate your efforts.
    Obviously FDA plays a critical role in the safety and 
prosperity of our nation. Your agency actually has some aspect 
of authority over approximately 20 cents of every dollar spent 
in America. You knew that, right? Pretty remarkable.
    Americans expect the food that they eat and the drugs they 
take will be safe and effective. So your reach is vast. You 
have authority over more than a 160,000 foreign establishments 
and a 135,000 domestic establishments, ranging from food 
processing plants to facilities that manufacture life-saving 
medications.
    In addition, FDA's tasked with the regulatory 
responsibility not only for the facilities but the individual 
products. So obviously that role is incredibly important, one 
that we can't take for granted, one that FDA has to get right.
    In delivering these regulatory responsibilities, it's very 
important that you have transparency and certainty and 
particularly when we look at small businesses as well as ag 
producers, like we have in my state of North Dakota, you know, 
their overwhelming concern is that the Federal Government in 
terms of that regulatory burden is reasonable, that common 
sense is applied, transparent and predictable, and so all of 
these things are vitally important to encourage the type of 
innovation and so forth that we need to continue to advance our 
economy and do it safely and well.
    So again I think as we pursue these solutions and I know 
you're involved in this and rightly so, this reorganization 
effort, we've got to avoid a one size fits all and we've got to 
use common sense. We've got to appreciate and understand the 
incredible role that small business plays in our economy, truly 
the back bone of our economy, and make sure that as you do 
these things that we don't get overly bureaucratic burdensome 
and so forth but in fact find ways to do things as effectively 
as possible and in a way that provides certainty to people 
across this country in all different aspects of the things that 
you do which are so critically important to our nation.
    Thank you for being here today with us, appreciate it.
    Senator Heinrich. Dr. Califf.

                 SUMMARY STATEMENT OF DR. ROBERT CALIFF

    Dr. Califf. Thank you, Chair Heinrich, Ranking Member 
Hoeven, and Members of the Subcommittee. Thanks for the chance 
to be here today.
    I'd like to start by thanking the Subcommittee for your 
continued support of FDA, especially over the last few years, 
as the agency has worked tirelessly to turn the corner on 
COVID-19, ensure a safe and nutritious food supply, and prepare 
for the emerging challenges of an expanding and changing 
landscape of food, medical, and tobacco products.
    This has been possible due to the vital and never-ending 
work of our dedicated FDA staff across the country and the 
world. To continue supporting their work, the budget I present 
to you today requests a total of $7.2 billion, a 7.8 percent 
increase in funding for the FDA.
    This significant increase in funding will have an immediate 
impact on optimizing the health benefits of safe and nutritious 
food, reducing harm from tobacco products, and ensuring the 
availability of safe and effective medical products.
    This funding will also enable the agency to continue to 
leverage new and emerging technologies, improve the recruitment 
and support of a highly skilled workforce, and adapt to new 
production and business models in the industries that we 
regulate.
    I want all of you to know as well as the American people 
that I, along with the leadership at FDA, will continue to make 
the long- and short-term strategic organizational changes and 
investments to ensure this agency is best positioned for future 
public health and regulatory challenges and opportunities.
    Since rejoining the agency I have consistently heard from 
industry, Congress, and other stakeholders that the Human Foods 
Program needed more attention and support. I don't have to tell 
you that the infant formula shortage highlighted many of these 
issues.
    We've begun the exciting process of implementing a 
revitalized and forward-looking FDA Human Foods Program, 
including a new model for the Office of Regulatory Affairs. 
We've announced a search for a Deputy Commissioner of Human 
Foods who will report directly to the Commissioner and will 
have clear authority over the organization's strategy and 
resource allocation of the Human Foods Program.
    As we embark on these changes, I want to be clear, our food 
is already the safest it has ever been and no other country has 
safer food, but that doesn't mean we can't improve; and while 
most public discussion has been about preventing food 
contamination, America has a critical need to improve its 
nutritional status and better understand and reduce the 
chemicals that put our food supply at risk.
    In addition to our focus on food, tobacco product 
regulation and enforcement remains one of our greatest 
opportunities to save lives.
    Although tobacco use is declining and vaping has been 
modestly declining in youth, we will lose almost 500,000 
Americans this year and millions of teenagers are already 
addicted to nicotine with many new users each day.
    That's why our budget requests an additional $100 million 
in user fees and authority to include manufacturers and 
importers of all deemed products, including electronic nicotine 
delivery systems or vaping products, among the tobacco product 
classes for which FDA assesses tobacco user fees.
    No one anticipated we'd be inundated with almost 27 million 
applications for vaping products. It's time for this industry 
to pay its fair share as we grapple with the ongoing ravages of 
tobacco and nicotine addiction.
    The U.S. continues to lead the world in medical product 
innovation but additional resources are needed to focus on key 
areas presenting new challenges. The ongoing Opioid overdose 
crisis, supply chain issues leading to a host of critical 
product shortages, increasing needs for post-market evaluation, 
and opportunities for amazing progress in battling cancer and 
neurodegenerative diseases.
    Finally, we also need to ensure continuity of the agency's 
modernization of our IT infrastructure and data processes. This 
isn't just making sure our computers are the latest model or 
that the Wi-Fi works consistently, although that is important.
    We need the ability to create systems that allow us to keep 
up with the complexities of the industries and products we 
regulate with the immense consequences for the health of all 
Americans.
    Finally, we need to be prepared for the next pandemic 
threat. We've learned a lot over the course of the COVID 
pandemic and need to assure the public that we're ready for the 
next event.
    I'd like to close by thanking the Subcommittee again for 
your continued support of the agency. As the gold standard for 
protecting health, FDA is trusted by Americans and relied upon 
around the world for our work, ensuring the safety, efficacy, 
and security of our nation's medical products and food supply.
    Once again, thanks for inviting me to testify before you 
today and I look forward to answering your questions.
    [The statement follows:]
            Prepared Statement of Dr. Robert M. Califf, M.D.
    Chairman Heinrich, Ranking Member Hoeven, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today 
to discuss the President's Fiscal Year 2024 Budget request for the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency).
    I would like to start by thanking the Subcommittee for your 
continued support of FDA. The Agency greatly appreciates the funding 
increases provided by the Subcommittee in the FY 2023 omnibus, as well 
as the expanded and new regulatory authorities included in the 
legislation to address cosmetics and medical device cybersecurity. Your 
continued partnership is critical as we further our mission to protect 
and promote the public health. FDA's talented and dedicated workforce 
has worked around the clock for the past three-plus years to respond to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, confront related challenges, and ultimately 
strengthen our nation's response to future outbreaks. We appreciate 
your ongoing support on a variety of programs and initiatives, 
including the dedicated resources in several critical areas that 
support our personnel and efforts, including employee pay costs, 
infrastructure, and data-modernization to ensure continuity of our 
vital work.
    The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for a swift, unified 
governmental response with collaboration across Federal agencies, 
state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, industry, and the 
private sector. As we collectively work together as a nation to turn 
the corner on COVID, the Agency is using the lessons learned to 
continue our core mission while we pursue new ways to better prepare 
for future threats and confront new challenges posed from an ever-
expanding marketplace of food, tobacco products, and medical products.
    For example, in the foods area, the Agency has remained laser-
focused on a variety of critical efforts, including stabilizing the 
supply chain for critical products such as infant formula, mitigating 
the risk of potential exposure to certain chemicals, toxic elements, 
and allergens, and facilitating consumer education regarding healthy 
foods through the development of updated and more accessible food 
labeling. Furthermore, with a Human Foods Program that regulates 
approximately 80% of foods consumed by Americans, including those 
bought in grocery stores, restaurants, and cafeterias, we are actively 
working towards a new, transformative vision for the program that is 
forward-thinking, proactive, and adaptive to an ever-changing and 
evolving landscape. FDA is taking steps, in line with the 
recommendations of the external evaluation conducted by the Reagan-
Udall Foundation, to ensure that our customers, the American public, 
can remain as fully confident in the food they eat as they are in the 
medical products they rely on to support their health; our FY 2024 
Budget places us firmly on the steps towards this path.
    The funding requested in the President's FY 2024 Budget request 
builds upon funding provided in the FY 2023 omnibus for foods and other 
product areas, while also acknowledging additional future needs and 
challenges. Our FY 2024 program level request totals $7.2 billion, 
which represents an overall increase of approximately $521.4 million in 
annual funding above the FY 2023 Enacted level. Of this total, $3.3 
billion is for user fees, which is an increase of approximately $149.5 
million above the FY 2023 Enacted level. As part of the total program 
level, the Budget also requests $3.96 billion in budget authority, 
which is an increase of approximately $372 million above the FY 2023 
Enacted level. These increases are organized into five critical areas 
that advance the Agency's activities in support of protecting and 
promoting human and animal health: (1) enhancing food safety, 
nutrition, and cosmetics oversight; (2) advancing medical product 
safety; (3) investing in core operations; (4) modernizing 
infrastructure, buildings and facilities; and (5) tobacco user fees. 
The Budget also provides $670 million of mandatory funding to advance 
the goals of HHS's Pandemic Preparedness Plan.
       enhancing food safety, nutrition, and cosmetics oversight
    FDA's Budget request provides a historic investment in FDA's Foods 
Program with $1.7 billion for food safety, nutrition, and cosmetics, an 
increase of $210.6 million above FY 2023 levels, to support our 
continual efforts and commitment to strengthening FDA's food safety and 
nutrition capacity. This funding will help to ensure our human and 
animal food supply is safe, sanitary, wholesome, and accurately 
labeled, as well as ensure that FDA can start to implement new 
authorities given by Congress to provide oversight of the safety and 
proper labeling of cosmetic products. Additionally, this Budget will 
increase FDA's inspectional capabilities, which include the risk-based 
oversight of food facilities subject to FDA's food safety regulations 
and help ensure a reliable and safe food supply chain.
New Era of Smarter Food Safety
    As a nation, our food supply is the safest it has ever been--but 
that does not mean we can't improve upon it. Specifically, as part of 
the total $1.7 billion request for FDA's Foods Program, the FY 2024 
Budget includes an increase of $37 million for our New Era of Smarter 
Food Safety initiative. This approach aims to bend the curve of 
foodborne illness by strengthening data access and analysis 
capabilities, as well as bolstering capacity and food safety 
inspectional efforts.
Healthy and Safe Food for All
    Within these requested Foods Program investments, FDA is also 
seeking resources for our ongoing efforts to provide safe food to the 
American public, with a renewed emphasis on the availability of healthy 
food options. The infant formula shortage from the last year serves as 
a stark example of the need for continued attention to the critical 
issues of food safety and security, the importance of quality 
nutrition, and the need for a safe and accessible supply of food 
products. To meet this goal, FDA is requesting an increase of $64 
million to modernize oversight of infant formula, empower consumers to 
make healthier food choices, and reduce exposure to toxic elements in 
the food supply. We are further requesting an increase of $5 million in 
order to improve FDA's ability to assess and track certain elements of 
the food supply chain and industry capacity in order to help minimize 
supply chain disruptions and enable a more resilient food system.
White House Commitment to Nutrition and Food Labeling
    Finally, I would note that as a cardiologist, I've seen firsthand 
the result of poor nutrition and diet, often stemming from childhood, 
and the long-term impacts from diet-related chronic disease that can 
occur. One of the first steps to addressing this often-neglected issue 
is to ensure consumers have adequate and necessary information on the 
food they eat. To advance these efforts, our budget also requests an 
increase of $12 million to strengthen nutrition and labeling work in 
alignment with the White House's National Strategy on Hunger, 
Nutrition, and Health.
                    advancing medical product safety
    In addition to ensuring a safe and healthy food supply, FDA's FY 
2024 Budget request includes $4.6 billion for strengthening human and 
animal health efforts across FDA's medical product centers, an increase 
of $199.9 million above the FY 2023 Enacted level.
Device Shortages and Supply Chain
    For example, as part of FDA's total medical product safety 
investments, this budget requests an increase of $11.6 million, for a 
total of $21.6 million, to continue building capabilities for FDA's 
Resilient Supply Chain and Shortages Program for medical devices, and 
for recruiting data science, supply chain, and medical device experts 
to properly staff the program. These resources support our efforts to 
help prevent and mitigate shortages of critical medical devices, 
improve our ability to work proactively with medical device 
stakeholders to assess vulnerabilities and enhance resiliency, and 
ultimately safeguard the availability of life- saving technologies that 
are most often needed by vulnerable populations.
ALS (ACT for ALS)
    In addition to maintaining access to current devices and other 
existing medical products, FDA also continues its focus on promoting 
the innovation and scientific advancement of new medical products, 
including products to address critical and rare diseases. Our medical 
products request therefore includes an increase of $2.5 million for 
staffing to implement the ACT for ALS Act and to help facilitate access 
to therapies for neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS). Additionally, this funding will help to expand the 
related development of new scientific approaches and tools that are 
available for the development of effective new medical products to 
prevent, diagnose, mitigate, and treat rare neurodegenerative diseases.
Combating the Overdose Crisis
    Finally, in addition to the ongoing efforts at the Agency to 
promote medical product access and innovation, I also remain deeply 
involved in efforts to address an issue that has devastated countless 
families across our country, the overdose crisis. FDA's Budget request 
includes a proposed increase of $23 million, for a total of $102.5 
million, to support the continued development of overdose reversal 
treatments, as well as treatments for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). This 
funding will also support preventative methods and tools which involve 
establishing satellite labs at International Mail Facilities with 
permanent staffing of scientists and investigators, along with 
expanding FDA's use of analytical tools for screening entries of 
potentially illicit products before they can enter our country. In 
addition, this funding will help advance the development, evaluation, 
and market authorization of digital health medical devices for further 
monitoring and addressing OUD inclusive of the patient perspective. 
Addressing this crisis is largely dependent on collaboration across the 
country, and utilizing real-time data to take effective and evidence-
based approaches on this issue remains crucial to our next steps to 
turning the corner on this epidemic.
Cancer Moonshot
    Further, FDA's Budget provides $50 million for FDA to advance the 
President's Cancer Moonshot goals. These funds will enhance Agency-wide 
efforts to improve evidence generation for underrepresented subgroups 
in oncology clinical trials, as well as to support pragmatic, 
decentralized trials and the development of sources of evidence that 
incorporate patient- generated data and real-world evidence. 
Additionally, these resources will assist in the expansion of FDA's 
efforts to facilitate the approvals of innovative and new cancer 
treatments by international regulatory authorities at the time of FDA 
approval and will foster collaboration on cancer treatments with other 
countries with standards comparable to the U.S. standard of care.
                      investing in core operations
    As highlighted in earlier portions of this testimony, our nation 
relies on FDA to provide rigorous and transparent scientific review, a 
predictable and responsive regulatory structure, a strong inspectorate, 
and expert staff to provide support for these activities. To meet these 
needs, as part of our total program level, our FY 2024 Budget requests 
$131.1 million above FY 2023 levels to continue to strengthen and 
support FDA's core operations and pursue new areas of improvement and 
innovation. In order to support further efforts, the Agency needs a 
strong framework for our programs, and for us that begins with data. 
Core operations also include initiatives such as advancing lab safety, 
information technology, and support services to help ensure FDA's 
ability to carry out its programmatic responsibilities.
Data Modernization and Enhanced Technologies
    FDA's core operations request includes an increase of $10 million 
for Data and IT Modernization to build new tools and greater capacity 
to analyze real-time information. To meet the challenges of emerging 
threats and the need for real-time evaluation, FDA relies on the 
ability to rapidly and continuously access, analyze, and aggregate 
multiple sources of information. From the COVID-19 pandemic to import 
alerts and domestic recalls, continual modernization of FDA's IT 
infrastructure has become increasingly more vital in order to keep pace 
with the evolution of outbreaks and disease. With these resources, FDA 
will continue to further build our centralized enterprise data 
modernization capabilities and strengthen the Agency's common data 
infrastructure, data exchange, and IT analytic services, talent, and 
tools. Investments in these critical areas will enable FDA to directly 
meet the challenges of our modern data-driven world, and continue to 
operate as the gold standard for product regulation and oversight.
           modernizing infrastructure, buildings & facilities
    In addition to necessary investments in our core operations, 
including digital infrastructure, the continuity of the Agency's 
critical work also requires funding to complete projects that will 
improve the condition of FDA's owned buildings and physical site 
infrastructure. As part of our overarching FY 2024 Budget, FDA's 
request provides a total of $395.9 million for infrastructure, 
buildings, and facilities. This funding will help to ensure that FDA's 
offices and labs across the country are optimally functioning. This 
funding will also directly support the Agency's priorities across the 
country by providing secure, modern, reliable, and cost-effective 
office and laboratory space that empowers FDA's workforce to protect 
and promote the safety and health of American families. By investing 
resources in FDA's facilities, the Agency will be able to continue to 
provide the high-quality infrastructure and facilities needed for FDA 
employees to work to ensure FDA can achieve its strategic priorities 
across the country and the world.
                           tobacco regulation
    As one of these strategic priorities, tobacco product regulation 
represents one of FDA's greatest opportunities to save lives. The 
Tobacco Control Act gave FDA immediate authority to regulate 
cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless 
tobacco. FDA finalized the Deeming rule in 2016, which extended FDA's 
tobacco authorities to all tobacco products, including cigars, hookah 
(waterpipe) tobacco, pipe tobacco, nicotine gels, and electronic 
nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) such as e-cigarettes. In 2022, a new 
Federal law went into effect clarifying FDA's authority to regulate 
tobacco products containing nicotine from any source, including 
synthetic or non-tobacco nicotine (NTN). FDA regulates the manufacture, 
marketing, and distribution of tobacco products. Key areas of focus 
include policy and rulemaking, compliance and enforcement, premarket 
review, research support, and public education campaigns.
    In addition to the priorities mentioned earlier across foods, 
medical products, core operations, and infrastructure, the Budget also 
requests an additional $100 million in user fees and requests authority 
to include manufacturers and importers of all deemed products--
including ENDS--among the tobacco product classes for which FDA 
assesses tobacco user fees. These products represent an increasing 
share of FDA's tobacco regulatory activities. The additional funding 
will support hiring more staff, help FDA bolster compliance and 
enforcement efforts for all tobacco products, and expand public 
education campaigns and science and research programs, as we work to 
mitigate harms and to protect consumers from the dangers of tobacco 
use. To ensure that resources keep up with new tobacco products, the 
proposal would also index future collections to inflation. This 
proposal would ensure that FDA has the resources to address all 
regulated tobacco products, including ENDS, which currently have high 
rates of youth use, as well as future novel products.
                         pandemic preparedness
    Finally, as we advance towards regular operations across our 
product centers, FDA remains aware that there is work yet to be done in 
our response to COVID-19, and it is critical that we learn from both 
our successes and the challenges we experienced to best improve our 
operations moving forward. Lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic 
have reiterated the need to proactively plan for the next public health 
emergency by ensuring FDA has the resources and capacity in place to 
fully respond. FDA plays a unique and central role to the whole-of- 
government response to protect and promote the public health, and in 
turn, we are requesting funding to improve FDA's core capabilities to 
help ensure there is the appropriate level of regulatory capacity to 
respond rapidly and effectively to any future pandemic or high 
consequence biological threat.
    Separate from our aforementioned requests for discretionary budget 
authority, FDA's Budget includes a request for $670 million in new 
mandatory resources available over 5 years to advance activities to 
better prepare FDA for the next pandemic. These funds would support the 
Agency's biodefense efforts, domestic and globally, by bolstering FDA's 
cadre of medical product reviewers and strengthening foundational 
processes. It would also increase FDA's capacity to leverage a One 
Health approach to respond to emerging threats. And lastly, these 
resources would help strengthen underlying technology platforms to 
improve electronic information exchange among stakeholders and bolster 
central coordinating capacity within the Office of the Commissioner. 
With these resources, FDA will have the opportunity now to build on 
lessons learned from previous responses and provide transformational 
investments to help ensure that FDA can respond quickly and effectively 
in times of a public health crisis.
                               conclusion
    This last year has presented some defining moments for the Agency 
and ample opportunities to bring the Agency into a new chapter. This 
Budget will help FDA maintain and expand on our current efforts, pursue 
new innovative strategies and methods, and provide a renewed focus on, 
and investment in, a variety of endeavors in the interest of public 
health for both humans and animals. I would like to close by thanking 
the Subcommittee again for your continued support of the Agency. I look 
forward to answering your questions today, and FDA looks forward to our 
collaboration and work together.

    Senator Heinrich. Thank you for your testimony this 
morning, Doctor.
    As you know and I mentioned in my introduction earlier this 
month, U.S. District Judge in Texas ruled that FDA's approval 
of Mifepristone more than 20 years ago was improper and issued 
a nationwide injunction to halt it.
    This sets an incredibly dangerous precedent in terms of 
both women's reproductive rights but also the FDA's review of 
drugs.
    Doctor, I'd like to give you the opportunity to speak about 
what impact this ruling could have on other FDA-approved drugs.
    Dr. Califf. Well, as you know, Senator, that matter's 
currently pending before the Supreme Court. So, I have to be 
brief and concise, but I will say that we are concerned about 
the potential future impacts of this case as reflected in the 
extensive briefs that have been filed by the Department of 
Justice on our behalf.
    This includes a wide range of concerns ranging from the 
well-being of patients, including women who need access to this 
drug, the pharmaceutical industry, and our ability to implement 
our statutory authority. So, the considerations are extensive.
    Senator Heinrich. Switching gears just a little bit, Opioid 
and fentanyl use is having dire impacts in communities across 
the country, including my home state where two-thirds of drug 
overdose deaths involve an Opioid.
    With Naloxone approved by the FDA and now available over 
the counter, what else is the FDA doing to continue addressing 
the Opioid epidemic broadly?
    Dr. Califf. Really appreciate the chance to address this 
and we should all be concerned because the nature of the 
epidemic is changing significantly from just the prescription 
misuse to now cartels driving fentanyl being delivered by mail 
to American homes with unsuspecting parents finding teenagers 
dead, in addition to the other problems that we've seen.
    Having said that, we have a major report that's out with a 
whole host of things that we're doing, but just to name a few. 
We recently are requiring now a mail-back system to be employed 
by all the manufacturers of opioids so that when people finish 
their supplies rather than having them sit in the medicine 
cabinet, they can be mailed back to the pharmacy. We also just 
changed the labeling of long-acting opioids just last week, 
taking into account that we still don't have the data we need 
about long-term benefits. In fact, there's a hearing going--I 
mean, an advisory committee going on today to talk about that.
    We have a number of other things that we think are 
important in the future. One that I'll mention that's very 
important to us is we'd like to have the authority to require 
that any new opioid company attempting to bring an opioid to 
the market must show that the new one has superiority to the 
old ones in terms of safety.
    Right now, by law we don't have the authority to make that 
decision. It would really help us if we had that authority. 
This is a carve-out, an exception. It's not pertinent. A lot of 
times the second drug along in a class turns out to have 
advantages that were unanticipated, but this is a case where 
for opioids we really need help.
    I can go on much longer, but I know we have limited time.
    Senator Heinrich. Do you want to touch on--there's a $23 
million increase in the budget specific to this. Do you want to 
touch on your plans for that increased funding?
    Dr. Califf. Sure. A lot of it has to do with the data 
systems that we need and the testing that we need to do in 
proximity to where the opioids are coming into the market.
    If you ever want to have an interesting field trip, go to 
our International Mail Facility at JFK and see the Labrador 
retrievers. Senator Baldwin made that trip, but it's just an 
enormous amount of stuff coming in that Americans are getting 
over the Internet, I think not realizing that often they're 
getting really bad stuff.
    So, we've got to invest in the testing to intercept this 
right at the border, have the data systems and the artificial 
intelligence to screen just as we do when people come into our 
airports to sort the bad guys from the good guys, and then 
we're hoping that there's going to be development of non-
addictive pain medicines. It's a place where, in my view, the 
industry has let us down.
    I say that having been on the industry side in part of my 
career. It's a tough job, but we're not succeeding in seeing 
non-addictive pain medicines coming through the pipeline. So, 
we need to do everything we can to push the industry and work 
with the NIH to make this happen.
    Senator Heinrich. The accelerated drug approval process at 
FDA can often be a game-changer for patients with serious 
medical conditions. It's a process that's important to myself, 
many advocates actually, yet many of these drugs approved 
through that process are not then reimbursed by the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).
    Doctor, what is the FDA doing to coordinate with CMS on 
drugs that are approved specifically through the accelerated 
process?
    Dr. Califf. Well, you may remember when I came in this 
time, you know, I likened it to a relay race where we run the 
first lap and then we hand off the baton to the payers, the 
private payers and CMS. What we're doing is try to make sure 
the information is much more seamless, that we have the 
clinical trials that are relevant to what they need, but it's 
also abundantly critical CMS does not influence our decisions 
about safety and effectiveness and we don't have any authority 
to influence CMS's decisions about the reasonable and necessary 
criteria and what we want to do is to make sure people have the 
right information so that CMS can make the best decisions it 
can, that it understands what we were looking at when we made 
our decisions.
    I think this is an area in American medicine where there's 
a lot more work to be done and we can maybe later in the 
session we can talk about.
    Senator Heinrich. Okay. Ranking Member Hoeven.
    Senator Hoeven. Mr. Chairman, I'm going to defer to our 
Appropriations Ranking Member Senator Collins for the first 
round. I always appreciate when she joins us.
    Senator Collins. Thank you very much.
    Dr. Califf, I have a series of questions that go to the 
heart of the recent court decision in Texas on Mifepristone.
    First, are FDA's regulatory decisions based on sound 
science?
    Dr. Califf. Yes, the latest available science with the best 
methods that we can find by civil servants who have no 
financial conflicts.
    Senator Collins. Second, are political or economic 
considerations weighed in your drug approval process?
    Dr. Califf. No. Of course, we're all human beings. We're 
aware of the discussions that go on, but that decisionmaking 
process is protected. Political appointees, even the 
Commissioner, me, I'm a political appointee, I think of myself 
as a doctor, but I'm politically appointed, we don't influence 
those decisions or intercede, except in very rare 
circumstances.
    Senator Collins. Third, has this abortion drug been on the 
market for more than two decades?
    Dr. Califf. Yes, 23 years, I think.
    Senator Collins. And has it been used by millions of women 
during that period?
    Dr. Califf. Many millions.
    Senator Collins. Let me read you a quote that was included 
in a filing by some physicians who were challenging the process 
by which the FDA approved this drug. These doctors say, ``For 
nearly a quarter century the FDA and the manufacturer have 
brazenly flouted the law and applicable regulations, 
disregarded holes and red flags and their own safety data, 
intentionally evaded judicial review, and continually placed 
politics above women's health.''
    Could you comment on that statement?
    Dr. Califf. Well, as I've said, we use the latest science, 
the best data to make our decisions, and these sorts of 
influences you're describing are protected within the FDA by 
the system for all drugs, not just this one.
    Senator Collins. And I appreciate those answers. I consider 
the FDA to be the gold standard globally in approving drugs and 
I find this court ruling to be more reflective of the judge's 
personal views rather than a fair and impartial analysis of the 
facts of the case.
    I do want to pick up on the issue that the Chairman raised 
because just as I question the court's decision in this case, I 
also question CMS's decision to deny Medicare patients access 
to two Alzheimer's drugs that have been approved by the FDA.
    My view is CMS should stay in its lane, the FDA should stay 
in its lane, and we've talked about that. So I'm not going to 
ask you to comment today because I want to quickly get in one 
other issue, and it has to do with cell and gene therapy 
approvals.
    Almost 5 years ago the FDA issued a forward-looking 
statement on the future of cell and gene therapy approvals and 
new policies to advance their development. The FDA stated its 
intent to maximize use of expedited programs, including 
accelerated approval to review gene therapies for serious life-
threatening diseases, and this subcommittee's bill included 
language last year to further encourage FDA to bring urgency to 
the gene therapy.
    In 2021 you stated that you are a fan of accelerated 
approval for the right conditions and as we've also talked, I 
believe that you are sincere in your belief that there's great 
promise here.
    However, what I am frequently hearing is that the FDA's 
Center on Biologics has put clinical holds without explanation 
on some promising cell therapy developments.
    Do you agree that there is a problem there?
    Dr. Califf. I want to acknowledge that I think there are 
some issues there that need to be worked out. This was 
recognized in the User Fee Agreements that were just concluded 
and you all passed just last year which are now going into 
effect.
    We're going to be hiring 150 to 200 people in this area 
under the leadership of Dr. Marks, who I think you'd agree has 
done a remarkable job with vaccines and now this is going to be 
a big focus of attention.
    I would emphasize when it comes to clinical holds, it's not 
just it's something that's going wrong with a patient. Often it 
has to do with the integration of manufacturing and a lot of 
the companies are start-ups without robust manufacturing 
facilities. So, there's a lot of work to go on, but we agree 
that this is an area we've got to move along more quickly.
    I know like everyone else you all talk about FDA approvals. 
I always feel like I need to emphasize we also don't approve a 
lot of things if they aren't safe and effective. If the risks 
outweigh the benefits, it's our job to stop those, but I do 
acknowledge that there's an issue here that we're addressing.
    Senator Collins. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Heinrich. Senator Peters.
    Senator Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Dr. Califf, last month, as the Chair of the Senate Homeland 
Security and Government Affairs Committee, I released an 
investigative report that found that there were major blind 
spots in our ability to accurately assess vulnerabilities in 
our drug supply chain.
    From both a national and a homeland security standpoint, 
I'm particularly concerned about shortfalls in the FDA's 
ability to use data analytics to effectively assess our 
reliance on foreign sources, especially in countries with 
rising geopolitical risk, like China.
    The Defense Department, of course, relies on the same 
international market to provide drugs for our service members.
    So my question for you, sir, do you agree that the FDA does 
not have sufficient visibility to identify some of the risks 
that could lead to supply shortages and if that is the case 
what are some of your top challenges to assess this risk?
    Dr. Califf. Thanks for raising this issue. It's taking up a 
large amount of my time right now and just a couple of preface 
statements.
    We're seeing shortages in every commodity we regulate, 
including food, devices, drugs, and biologics. The only one 
we're not seeing it in is tobacco, oddly enough, the one I 
might prefer there was a shortage, it's not occurring. They 
seem to have figured it out.
    The second preface point that I would make is that I was on 
the National Academy of Medicine's Supply Chain Committee just 
before being nominated and spent a lot of time working on it 
then and the report that you put out is very consistent. I 
think there are five different reports now that make this 
point.
    If FDA is looking through a windshield, we got mud on our 
windshield because we can see some things but there's a lot 
that we can't see because we don't have requirements of the 
industry to give us the data that we need and we don't have 
funding for the data systems and analytics that we need, and, 
if you wish, I'm glad to go into any amount of detail.
    The one other point I want to make in general is that 
there's an element of this, that is clearly in FDA's lane, and 
there's an element which is more of an all of government; that 
is, when we see a problem, many of the levers that are really 
important to pull exist outside the FDA when it comes to things 
like tariffs or investments in manufacturing facilities in the 
U.S. with funding which are two of the areas I think we've got 
to look at.
    Senator Peters. Well, great. Well, I guess in further 
conversations we've had a follow-up report, two reports now, 
one we did prior to the pandemic and since then it's gotten 
worse, not better, and we've got a number of ideas how to 
address it but love to have your thoughts and meet with you at 
some point in the near future.
    Dr. Califf. I'd like to, and your point about insecure 
countries that we're dependent on is really critical right now.
    Senator Peters. Right, absolutely. Thank you.
    Sir, I'd also like to follow up with you on the FDA's work 
to restore confidence in our nation's infant formula supply.
    As you're well aware, in Michigan we witnessed the 
devastating harm that can come from bacterial contamination of 
infant formula that families rely on, and it's clear, 
absolutely clear that we have a lot more work to do. In the 
most recent Michigan case, once again contaminated formula was 
recalled only long after it was already distributed, sold, and 
consumed. This put vulnerable infants at risk and once again in 
response the FDA asked manufacturers to voluntarily notify the 
FDA of any time a product sample is found to be positive for 
Cronobacter or Salmonella, even if the affected lots have not 
yet been distributed.
    So my question is are you confident the industry will 
consistently volunteer accurate and verifiable information to 
the FDA or do you think we're going to need to be thinking of 
legislative change to require earlier industry reporting, if 
necessary?
    Dr. Califf. I am confident the majority of the industry 
will comply, but I would prefer it if the things that are 
really needed are written into law. It's a lesson I've learned 
this year.
    You know, it's like anything in America. Most people want 
to do the right thing and they do it but you have outliers. In 
the case of the infant formula situation, it's a concentrated 
industry. So one entity not doing the right thing can create a 
problem.
    I do want to point out the recent case you talk about, we 
changed the standards and this particular entity got caught in 
the middle of it, didn't meet what we expected them to do. I 
think the whole industry is moving to the standard of 
notification and better bracketing of products, but still I 
think having the authority is so much better.
    I've been on the industry side and when the industry is 
told you must do something, it actually does it because the 
penalties are very different than in a voluntary situation.
    Senator Peters. Right. Well, thank you. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Senator Heinrich. Thank you.
    Ranking Member Hoeven.
    Senator Hoeven. Dr. Califf, as you and I have discussed, I 
am concerned about FDA decisions to allow Mifepristone to be 
distributed by mail and without physician supervision.
    So my question to you is will you commit to following the 
decision of the courts with respect to the drug and how it's 
handled?
    Dr. Califf. I'll just say the FDA intends to comply with 
any court orders.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you.
    And I would like to follow up on the infant formula supply. 
Talk about supply--we're still getting reports in some cases of 
supply of certain types of brands. Where are we at with the 
supply of infant formula and what else are you doing to make 
sure it's available?
    Dr. Califf. You know, I've tried to stay understated on 
this because, you know, the day of the Abbott recall was the 
day I was confirmed and I discovered all these problems inside 
the FDA that needed to be fixed. We could have a long 
discussion about how much those problems actually affected 
infant formulas specifically I don't think as much as people 
think, but that doesn't change the fact that we needed to fix 
our own house internally.
    But, I am pleased to say today we're over 90 percent in 
stock which is higher than it was before the recall. So there's 
plenty of formula out there and March 28th we put out our 
Stability Report with a whole host of things that we've done, 
but I also want to say that while we're stable at this point 
and probably a little better off than we were before the 
recall, there are four or five key things that are beyond the 
FDA that need to be fixed.
    It's a concentrated industry. We don't have enough 
variation in the suppliers. Putting up a new infant formula 
plant takes years and, in fact, Abbott has decided to put up a 
new one. It's going to take a couple years for them to do it 
and they have the most capacity in the industry already, but 
you've got to get 30 ingredients right, the quality has to be 
there. So, this is not a trivial thing for start-ups to begin 
to do.
    So, there's a lot of work to do to diversify the industry 
to assure that if there's a bad lot event like the major flood 
that occurred in Michigan, you know, one in a hundred-year 
flood, that the whole thing doesn't become short again. So, I 
don't want to appear complacent. We still have work to do. It's 
very much there in our report.
    Senator Hoeven. So I think that answer is helpful. I think 
it reassures people that supply is out there and that you're 
working on it and I think in your leadership role that's the 
kind of thing that both in terms of the information and action 
that can help address this type of situation. So I appreciate 
that.
    Dr. Califf. If I may mention, I know you're particularly 
concerned about rural areas, I'll just say in everything that 
we're currently regulating, rural areas are in need of better 
support.
    Now, you know, FDA can measure these things but we can't 
necessarily fix it, but in infant formula I know that's still a 
bit of an issue as the supply's up overall but it tends to be 
centrally distributed to start with. So, we're very much 
working on that every day. I just wanted to make sure that was 
noted.
    Senator Hoeven. Right. Particularly when you're looking for 
certain size and certain brands, certain types, you know, 
obviously it's there in the urban center and the big store but 
that's exactly right and so I appreciate that.
    In regard to the traceability rule, this goes back to my 
opening comments, and I'm concerned about the size and scope of 
the traceability rule and, you know, the workability.
    So, I mean, do you have a comprehensive list of the 
products that you're going to cover under the rule? Who's going 
to have the burden of maintaining records, the entity, the 
business, or the industry, or FDA, or both, and then are you 
going to allow exceptions again for small business, family-
owned business kind of thing?
    Dr. Califf. Sure. As we've discussed before, we've got to 
be sensitive to the needs of small organizations and we already 
have exceptions for, for example, family farms and for retail 
establishments that are small. There are exceptions, but, you 
know, there's a phrase used in the industry ``educate before 
you regulate'' and what we want to do, if we look 10 years 
ahead, we hope the entire supply chain will be digitized, 
right, so that we can distribute the right stuff to the right 
place regardless of where it is in America, but for smaller 
companies to get there, they're going to need help and support.
    We recognize that and it'll be shown in our adaptive 
approach to regulation.
    Senator Hoeven. The exception is very important and that 
rule can get away from you. So I'm glad you're watching it 
closely.
    My last question is regarding the Medicare and Medicaid 
coverage of Alzheimer's drugs. I joined with 19 of my 
colleagues, including Senator Collins, in sending a letter to 
CMS expressing our dismay for the agency's coverage termination 
on Alzheimer's drug.
    AS Commissioner and a physician, are you concerned with CMS 
choosing not to cover some of those FDA-approved Alzheimer's 
drugs?
    Dr. Califf. Senator, you know I can't comment on CMS's 
decision.
    Senator Hoeven. Sure you can.
    Dr. Califf. All I can say is we evaluated and considered it 
safe and effective.
    I'll just point this is an amazing area of biology that is 
still a problem.
    Senator Hoeven. That's the good comment for a non-comment.
    Dr. Califf. Okay.
    Senator Hoeven. You determined them to be safe and 
effective.
    Dr. Califf. But that's different than reasonable and 
necessary which is the CMS standard. I just got--you know, we 
have family involvement with this disease. It affects my family 
greatly. So, I'm very much hoping the biology works out.
    There's a whole bunch of new clinical trials about to come 
in. I think this will--I'm actually very confident having 
talked with CMS we'll get this resolved in a positive way and 
let's see the data as it comes in.
    Senator Hoeven. I appreciate that.
    Senator Heinrich. Chair Murray.
    Senator Murray. Well, thank you very much, Chair Heinrich 
and Ranking Member Hoeven.
    You know, families back home are really counting on us to 
work in this committee and across the Appropriations in a 
timely bipartisan way so we can pass our funding bills that 
keep them safe and our country strong. So I'm really glad this 
committee is continuing full steam ahead with return to regular 
order and talking about making sure that FDA has the resources 
it needs to live up to its really critical mission because make 
no mistake protecting our families is not just about how strong 
our military is, it is about how safe our food or drugs or our 
medical devices are, not to mention how smooth our supply 
chains are to ensure that families get what they need.
    We've had some tough reminders of that over the years, 
whether it's the medical supply shortages during the pandemic 
or the agency's important work to quickly, safely review COVID 
treatments and vaccines, or, as we've talked about here, the 
inexcusable baby formula shortage.
    That is really why I pressed very hard to make sure our end 
of the year package last year included some really important 
reforms to FDA, but we have more work to do, including on this 
subcommittee, to make sure we provide the resources for all 
this, as well, because there is a direct line between FDA 
having the resources it needs and the safety of American 
families.
    Every time families back in Washington State go to the 
grocery store or gather around the dinner table or fill a 
prescription or rely on a medical device, they're really 
putting their trust in FDA and their experts to uphold the gold 
standard of safety and effectiveness, and let me just say once 
again, especially in light of recent events, the determination 
about whether drugs are safe and effective needs to be left to 
the experts at FDA, not politicians and certainly not judges.
    We got a stark reminder of this in the recent weeks when 
extreme, poorly reasoned, and dangerous rulings of judges 
undermined FDA's authority to review and approve drugs by 
declaring themselves to know better than FDA's experts about 
medication abortion.
    FDA has an enormous responsibility and some hard work ahead 
to make sure it is living up to that responsibility. The last 
thing our families need at this critical moment is for 
politicians to undermine its authority or shortchange its 
efforts.
    So I'm really glad today, Dr. Califf, to have you before 
this committee to talk about what the agency is doing and what 
it requires to tackle the challenges you have ahead, and I do 
want to start out with the Mifepristone issue.
    As you know, the Supreme Court is going to decide a case 
that really threatens access to medication abortion nationwide 
and seeks to undermine the FDA's authorities to approve and 
regulate medicine.
    Let me ask the question this way. Commissioner Califf, 
would you speak to the implications of this case on the drug 
approval process and the scientific rigor with which the agency 
approaches drug applications?
    Dr. Califf. As we discussed already today, our decisions 
are based on the latest science, the best data we can find, the 
weighing of risks and benefits by our professionals who are 
full-time civil servants without financial conflict, and there 
is concern in this case about the impact on a wide variety of 
things, including patients, women in need of access to a drug 
which is approved, the pharmaceutical industry itself because 
of the threat to the separation of this decision about what's 
approval and what's not sequestered away from political 
influence. So, these are all concerns that we have.
    Senator Murray. So I take from your answer that this, of 
course, could have an implication on Mifepristone but also on 
the process that all of the drugs and tools that are going 
through the FDA?
    Dr. Califf. This is well reflected in the extensive briefs 
that the Justice Department has filed on our behalf and are 
publicly available.
    Senator Murray. Thank you very much.
    Dr. Califf, at the end of last year, as you know, I 
negotiated and passed the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation 
Act of 2022 which Senator Collins, who just left, was a 
critical part of. It provided new authority to your agency to 
make sure that cosmetics are safe for the people who use them.
    The FDA finally, after many years, will know who is making 
and marketing what products and where and what ingredients are 
being used and when there is an adverse event, like severe 
rashes or hair falling out or worse. This is the first time and 
I'm very excited that you now have the authority to regulate 
this. I can't tell you how many people I've talked to didn't 
even know they weren't regulated before. So very important 
step. You will now have the power to take products off the 
shelves if they're not safe.
    Can you provide us with an update about how you're moving 
forward with this new authority and, importantly for this 
committee, what resources you will need to implement them?
    Dr. Califf. Sure. I'm still stunned by the average of 12 
cosmetics a day for women and six cosmetics a day for men, 
something I hadn't really considered before, but I am pleased 
to say that we're on track and I'm really excited that we've 
moved this under the auspices of Dr. Namandje' N. Bumpus, who's 
our Chief Scientist.
    If you all have not met her, I would urge you to meet with 
her. She was the Chair of a Department of Pharmacology at 
Hopkins and I tried to talk her out of coming to FDA because 
she had a good life as an endowed professor, but she's a great 
civil servant, a preeminent scientist in that role.
    We're moving along well with the registration issues that 
are part of this, developing the adverse event system. We've 
asked for $5 million for next year which is a very important 
part of the budget. Our estimate for the overall dealing with 
this $70 billion a year industry is about $40 million to get us 
where we need to be over time and we'll phase that in so that 
we can show progress.
    I know I've learned we need to show that in order to get 
people interested, but there are real safety issues that we're 
encountering. So, I'm glad we have that opportunity.
    Senator Murray. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Senator Heinrich. Senator Hyde-Smith.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, 
Dr. Califf, for being here today before the committee because I 
certainly look forward to your questions.
    I just find it extremely concerning that under your watch 
the FDA allowed the dangerous life-ending, because they do kill 
the baby, chemical abortion drugs to be ordered by consumers 
through mail or purchased in retail pharmacies without ever 
seeing a doctor in person, I think that's the concern of many, 
many people. In 2016, as you know, the risk evaluation and 
mitigation strategies were changed to eliminate the 
requirements that non-fatal adverse events would even have to 
be reported to FDA.
    So that's been 7 years that if the woman almost died, it 
was not reported. It was only reported if there were fatal 
cases. The FDA that claimed this drug to be safe in part based 
on the lack of reports of non-fatal adverse events. I agree 
with the fifth circuit's description of this deeply disturbing 
this of really-not-looking-at-it or the head-in-the-sand 
approach. Because of the lackluster approach to safety, women 
seeking to use these drugs do so without the chance to be 
screened by an ultrasound for complications. My main concern is 
an ectopic pregnancy that if the baby is not positioned which 
is deadly, or if she's further along that she's saying that she 
is, I'm truly grateful that the two Federal courts have ruled 
that the FDA's most recent action failed to meet its legal 
obligation.
    So that's what the lawsuit is about, not judging if the 
drug is safe or unsafe but that the FDA failed to meet its 
legal obligation to protect the safety of women and girls and 
that it also directly violated longstanding Federal criminal 
laws that expressly prohibited the mailing and interstate 
shipping of abortion drugs.
    So the FDA, it's more of a legal issue of the procedure 
that happened than a safety issue of determining what drug is 
safe. If the Supreme Court allows the lower court rulings to go 
into effect, will the FDA fully comply with the decision 
without delay and not attempt to flout the ruling under the 
guise of some kind of enforcement discretion? Would you apply 
immediately?
    Dr. Califf. First, let me just reply to one small thing 
that you said, not such a small thing, but I do want to offer a 
different viewpoint on the adverse event reporting.
    Adverse event reporting is required of all drugs, including 
this one. The reporting of adverse events is not being ignored 
in this case. It's required just like with all drugs. What was 
done was to take away a separate form that's different from all 
the rest of the drugs.
    But with regard to your question, we're confident the law's 
on our side. We've appealed the District Court's decision to 
the Supreme Court and have sought a stay pending that appeal, 
but FDA, as I've said already, does intend to comply with any 
court orders.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Okay. In making its decision to 
eliminate the in-person dispensing requirement, none of the 
studies the FDA cited, which were largely conducted by abortion 
activists, studied the drugs under the new no-test tele-
abortion regime.
    Despite this, the FDA concluded that it was safe, but even 
the FDA admitted that this decision would increase emergency 
room visits for pregnant women taking the drugs.
    How comfortable is the FDA in recommending practices that 
have not yet been fully tested for safety?
    Dr. Califf. Senator, since that's before the Supreme Court, 
I have to refer you to the briefs that have been filed by the 
Justice Department on our behalf. The answers to these 
questions are discussed in detail there.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Okay. And how many studies has FDA 
considered that studied the effects of abortion drugs on young 
girls as required by law?
    Dr. Califf. Again, I'd have to refer you to the briefs that 
have been filed by the Justice Department.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Okay. And the law also requires the FDA 
to respond to petitions within a 180 days, but the FDA waited 
roughly 14 years and nearly 3 years to respond to citizens' 
petitions challenging FDA approval and deregulation of chemical 
abortion drugs.
    Can you speak to that?
    Dr. Califf. I'll just say again this is discussed in the 
briefs that are filed by the Justice Department and it would 
take a long answer.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Okay. My time is up.
    Senator Heinrich. Senator Tester.
    Senator Tester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, 
for having this hearing.
    I want to thank you for being here, Dr. Califf. I think you 
guys have been the gold standard. I appreciate the fact that 
you're in the position that you're in and I want to thank you 
for your work.
    I'm not going to get into the activist judges. I'm not 
going to get into any of that stuff. The fact of the matter is, 
is that the FDA has done a great job and have done it for a 
long time and it continues under your watch.
    I come from Rural America. You touched on it a little bit 
with the Ranking Member, but when we spoke last year we talked 
about the importance of ensuring good health outcomes in Rural 
America.
    Given your background as a clinical researcher, we can talk 
about the clinical trials for new and innovative medical 
treatments and how they work for Rural America.
    So clinical trials are critical, you know that, for drug 
development. Montana's rural population face many challenges in 
assessing and accessing clinical trials for innovative 
pharmaceuticals.
    So the question is this. Can you explain how the FDA's 
budget allocation supports the expansion of clinical trials to 
rural areas, including efforts to increase diversity in 
clinical research participants and ensuring safety and efficacy 
of the drugs for all Americans, regardless of geographic 
location?
    Dr. Califf. Sure. Thanks for the question.
    I think it's critically important. I can't resist making 
one comment which is that we can't ask clinical trials to fix a 
structural issue with our health care system in general, but 
having said that, we got to do everything we can for the 
clinical trials.
    We have an office essentially charged with dealing with 
diversity across the board, including clinical trials. There's 
a cross-agency task force working on this. We have several 
guidance that have come out and, of course, our increasing 
encouragement of adoption of the use of telehealth in clinical 
trials is a big part of this.
    Here, I'd also emphasize that we've got to get broadband 
out to the rural communities. The money allocated for that as I 
understand it. So we can't use that technology unless someone 
is wired up in order to be able to use it, and I can't 
emphasize enough let's say you have a significant cancer 
driving three hours to get your experimental treatment, 
something a lot of people just can't do, and so we've got to 
set up these systems that can efficiently get the clinical 
trials done.
    Finally, I'd just say the real-world evidence which has 
been a big part of my career that is using data that's all part 
of the health care system and then doing the trials more 
virtually is a rapidly growing method that we're very much in 
favor of.
    So, all these things are in play, but I'm not going to 
argue we're there yet. We've got a ways to go in this regard.
    Senator Tester. So in that regard of broadband, I can tell 
you the gentleman to my right, Senator Manchin and myself 
worked on a bill called The Bipartisan Infrastructure Package. 
It'll get these folks wired up as soon as we get that money out 
the door and get the cable in the ground.
    Dr. Califf. I had a flat tire in West Virginia and I 
couldn't even use my cell phone. It was not a pleasant night.
    Senator Tester. That's Manchin's fault.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Tester. Let me get you his phone number.
    Dr. Califf. There was no way to call. I had to wait for a 
passerby to come by.
    Senator Tester. I want to talk a little bit not because I 
have an agenda on this, I'm just curious. You talked about 
approvals and you also talked about disapprovals.
    Can you give me a number of the drugs that you guys take a 
look at? Is it a fairly static number that you disapprove 
compared to what you approve?
    Dr. Califf. I would say it's really hard, Senator, because 
this all starts when a scientist has an idea and it's like one 
out of a thousand ideas get into human clinical trials because 
to get to human clinical trial, you got to have the money 
invested, an IRB has to be approved, the FDA has to approve it.
    Out of those that get into the first human clinical trial, 
about 90 percent don't make it to the market.
    Senator Tester. Okay.
    Dr. Califf. Now the big change that's happened is we meet 
with the companies all the time. It used to be there were a lot 
of applications submitted that had no hope. Now the only 
applications that go in are the ones that have gotten all the 
way to the end of the game. We get rid of all the others. Very 
efficient financially but also protects patients who are being 
enrolled in clinical trials for drugs that aren't going to 
work.
    Senator Tester. So you just talked about the lengths, so 
that gets into timeliness.
    As a doctor, how do you think the FDA's doing on 
timeliness, and this is being somewhat self-critical or pat 
yourself on the back?
    Dr. Califf. I think we're the fastest in the world at high 
quality. Now there's some countries that don't have much of a 
regulatory system at all. That's different. We're the fastest 
in the world, but we're also the most thorough and we're the 
only regulatory entity that does an independent analysis of the 
data.
    I'm pleased to say as of today we're meeting a hundred 
percent of our user fee agreement requirements. Remember 
industry comes in and the user fees negotiates with us and the 
primary thing that they measure is whether we're meeting our 
timeframes that are required and even in the midst of this 
recovering from the pandemic we're now meeting all of our 
requirements for timeliness.
    We just discussed earlier in the area of biologics with 
gene editing. That's an area that we're emphasizing where we've 
got to do some work.
    Senator Tester. Thank you, Dr. Califf. Keep up the good 
work.
    Senator Heinrich. Thank you, Senator Tester.
    Senator Manchin, did you want to share yourself on with the 
Doctor?
    Senator Manchin. As soon as we get that tower up, you'll be 
in good shape.
    You and I talked briefly and I want to go over some of the 
things we talked about. The FDA is holding an advisory 
committee meeting on opiates today in particular on the 
questionable clinical trial practice known as enriched 
enrollment. The agenda today has a majority of the speakers who 
attended the very questionable IMPACT Meetings that we spoke 
about and I previously expressed concerns and I think most of 
you all know about the IMPACT meetings. That was the 
questionable pay to play where they would pay to present 
themselves before the FDA advisory committees.
    The speakers today have not been disclosed, have not even, 
I don't think, disclosed their involvement with IMPACT if they 
had been partaking in those before. I find it imperative that 
this advisory committee has non-ideological presenters to avoid 
the appearance of industry influence on the agency's 
decisionmaking. As it stands, this very much appears there will 
be heavy influence on today's advisory committee.
    Let me tell you what I'm speaking about. We got more and 
more opiates coming on the market. My state is ground zero. All 
of you all have--every state has problems and you and I talked 
about this. So there shouldn't be--to put a new opiate on the 
market, some manufacturer coming to you, there has to be 
something that it's replacing, something that's not doing--and 
this is a better, more improved.
    We take nothing off. Everything stays on the market as you 
bring more on, and if you can explain that to me and what we 
can do to make sure we're passing legislation that allows you 
to remove when you find approving drug, if you can explain that 
to us, it'd be appreciated.
    Dr. Califf. Yes. So, first, we'll get back to you on the 
advisory committee meeting, but the issue that you raise, we 
discussed this earlier before you came in, but to be clear 
about it, the most important thing I think you can do is give 
us the statutory authority in the area of opioids to require 
that anything new that attempts to come on the market has to 
demonstrate clear superiority in terms of safety to the all 
drug.
    Now whatever else you want to attach to that, we talked a 
bit yesterday, it was pretty much the same conversation we had 
in 2016, as I recall. So it could really help us move more 
quickly and accomplish the common goals that we have.
    Senator Manchin. Are your staff, are they aware of the 
EFFECTIVE Act?
    Dr. Califf. Yes.
    Senator Manchin. Okay. Is there some ways that you think we 
could improve that to give you more authority?
    Dr. Califf. We'd like to work with you on that.
    Senator Manchin. Okay.
    Dr. Califf. And inviting your staff to come out to FDA and 
we'll come to you.
    Senator Manchin. We'll do that. I think she's working with 
your staff to make an appearance there and sit down and work 
with you all.
    Let me ask this. With today's meeting, what additional 
stakeholders have you invited? Did you make any adjustments so 
it'll be more of a----
    Dr. Califf. We only had that conversation last night. So 
there wasn't time to adjust the meeting, but there was an open 
session. The gentleman you brought up, Dr. Kolodney, was the 
second public speaker and I think, you know, as you pointed 
out, it wasn't two--he got five minutes but I know you'd like 
for him to get more time.
    Senator Manchin. Well, the person that I'm saying was 
basically important to the IMPACT before is the person who got 
all the time, you know, and he was definitely tied to the 
industry.
    If the pharmaceutical--I mean, you talk about the fox in 
the henhouse, that's our problem. It's just killing our state. 
It just has done irreparable damage.
    Let me ask you this. On the recommendation of external 
review of the FDA Regulations of Opiates Report that you 
ordered was to ensure the FDA be as transparent as possible 
regarding decisionmaking. Advisory committees present complex 
scientific reviews of safety and efficacy of medicines most 
patients and general public really don't have a background to 
fully understand the scientific studies discussed in these 
settings.
    Dr. Califf, you recently have been pushing to reduce voting 
in the FDA's advisory committees, even stating in a Med page 
Today interview that ``voting doesn't matter,'' but they're the 
ones that do have the expertise, the public does not, and how 
does ending voting for the advisory committee meetings improve 
the transparency and the public trust that you advocated for?
    Dr. Califf. To be clear about what I said and what I 
believe,----
    Senator Manchin. It wasn't taken out of content, was it, 
sir, because we never would do that.
    Dr. Califf. A little bit, but generally--so what I'd say, 
we're pushing to have advisory committees, not less.
    Senator Manchin. Yeah.
    Dr. Califf. The point I was making is that people focus on 
the vote, but its' the FDA that has to make the decision, not 
the advisory committee. What the FDA employees and leaders want 
out of the advisory committee is deep knowledge about the 
thinking from multiple points of view.
    What is it that is driving their thinking and because it is 
advisory, people tend to focus on like if it's an eight to five 
vote----
    Senator Manchin. Well, here is the thing. You know, you 
know the one I'm talking about. It's 11 to two.
    Dr. Califf. Yeah.
    Senator Manchin. Please don't put this drug on the market. 
They overrule and you all put it on the market. You weren't 
there. They put it on the market anyway. We begged them not to. 
Then they had the--finally the company pulled it off themselves 
but it was just horrific. I mean, I'm saying these are the 
people that have knowledge thinking it was dangerous to put it 
on the market.
    Dr. Califf. I hear you. What I want is much more public 
discussion about the issues, less focus on like a cage match of 
who's voting for what and rushing out the door.
    Senator Manchin. Just a number of states have been affected 
beyond anybody's imagination.
    Dr. Califf. Senator, as I told you yesterday, I helped 
start a not-for-profit in Dayton, Ohio, which is right there 
with West Virginia, as you know, in terms of death rates and 
other problems. I have a deep sense of what this is about and 
we're going to work on it as hard as we can. I'm not pretending 
we got everything right. So, I appreciate your concern.
    Senator Manchin. We need help on that. I was alarmed to see 
that the meeting that was going on today and how it was put 
together and the presenters and who had the time to do that. It 
just didn't seem like it was very balanced.
    Dr. Califf. I hear you.
    Senator Manchin. Thank you, sir.
    Senator Heinrich. I want to thank Commissioner Califf for 
being here today.

                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    Questions for the record are due by next Wednesday, April 
26th and we'd certainly appreciate responses back from FDA 
within 30 days.
             Questions Submitted by Senator Martin Heinrich
    Question. Last December, the Reagan-dall Foundation released its 
evaluation of the FDA's human foods program and highlighted serious 
organizational challenges within the agency.
    Since that report was issued, several senior staff within FDA 
announced their departure from the agency. How will FDA continue to 
move forward and address the challenges identified within the 
Foundation report with such a significant change in senior leadership?
    Answer. Following the release of Reagan-Udall Foundation's 
Operational Evaluation of FDA's Human Foods Program, Commissioner 
Califf announced a proposal for a unified Human Foods Program (HFP) and 
a new model for the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA). Since the 
announcement, the Agency has made significant progress to implement the 
vision, including initiating a competitive national search for a new 
Deputy Commissioner for Human Foods who will report directly to the 
Commissioner and provide leadership and expertise for FDA's entire 
nutrition and food safety programs. The Commissioner has identified 
competent and capable FDA senior leaders to fill the leadership roles 
in ORA, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), and 
the Office of Food Policy and Response (OFPR) during the transition, 
while the Agency is also working to address the challenges identified 
in the Reagan-Udall report through an Agency-wide approach. FDA has 
created an internal Implementation and Change Management Group--
comprising current and future leaders from all components of the Human 
Foods Program and from other Centers--to develop a detailed plan to 
ensure the successful execution of a unified Human Foods Program and to 
restructure ORA into an enterprise-wide organization supporting the 
priorities of the Human Foods Program and the Centers, while focusing 
on the core functions of inspections, import operations, sampling, 
laboratory analysis, and investigations.
    Question. Where is the agency on hiring a Deputy Commissioner for 
Human Foods?
    Answer. The Agency's search for a Deputy Commissioner for Human 
Foods commenced in late February through a vacancy announcement under 
our Title 21 hiring authority (granted to us by the 21st Century Cures 
Act). FDA is currently in the process of interviewing several qualified 
candidates and hopes to make a selection for this important position as 
soon as possible. This is a critical role and the Agency is moving as 
quickly as possible, although we need to follow the necessary legal 
processes. The Agency looks forward to keeping you apprised of our 
progress.
    Question. Your budget requests an additional $11.6 million to 
continue building capabilities for FDA's Resilient Supply Chain and 
Shortages Program for medical devices. With supplemental funding ending 
in 2025, how does the FDA plan to manage this program for the long 
term?
    Answer. FDA appreciates the funds Congress has provided thus far--
the $10 million total provided across FY 2022 and FY 2023 were the 
first funds provided to FDA's base for medical device supply chain 
efforts, and we have been able to transition some staff and 
capabilities funded by the COVID-19 supplementals to start building a 
permanent, serviceable program. The Agency is still in a building 
stage, however--having essentially started building from scratch during 
the pandemic, FDA has had to develop infrastructure where it did not 
exist, recruit expertise it did not have, and start building 
capabilities and a program where none had existed.
    What FDA has today remains a largely reactive program. It is making 
a huge difference for the domestic supply chain, but major 
vulnerabilities continue to put the nation's supply chain and the
    U.S. healthcare system as a whole, at risk. Medical device 
shortages most often impact vulnerable and underserved populations, 
such as children, rural communities, and veterans. The Agency is also 
aware that China accounts for approximately 45% of finished medical 
devices imported into the U.S., and that the U.S. remains heavily 
dependent on China for raw materials and components that are used to 
make medical devices. Patient safety and national security depend on 
having preventative capabilities. FDA seeks to get out of ``response 
mode'' by focusing on what is needed for a serviceable, sustainable 
program where the Agency can intervene and help prevent shortages from 
happening in the first place.
    The request for an additional $11.6 million is the difference 
between a such a reactive program and transitioning to a proactive 
program that is preventive--so regardless of the situation, whether it 
is a massive pandemic or a spot shortage in one part of the country, 
FDA is not left scrambling and playing catch up. Without these 
additional funds in FY 2024, FDA will need to start scaling back the 
existing program capabilities as COVID supplemental funding runs out.
    Question. How does FDA view shortages in medical devices from a 
national security perspective?
    Answer. Medical product supply chains are critical to U.S. national 
security, and preventing shortages and interruptions depend, in part, 
on FDA having the resources and the authorities to establish a 
proactive supply chain program to prevent these problems from happening 
before they occur, particularly in the face of global threats and 
cybersecurity attacks. Simply stated, health security is national 
security.
    The nation's continued dependence on China for critical devices and 
the raw materials and components used to manufacture them is one of the 
largest threats to health security and infrastructure. This was evident 
during the early phases of the pandemic, China held products hostage 
and did not allow the U.S. to get them out of that country. There also 
continue to be cybersecurity threats that could force manufacturers to 
go offline.
    In order to build a strong healthcare structure that is resilient 
to these national security challenges, FDA needs the resources to have 
visibility into the supply chain and get information as early as 
possible. The Agency also needs critical authorities, including the 
removal of the temporal limitation of ``during, or in advance of'' a 
public health emergency for notifications of manufacturing disruptions 
to the FDA. Additionally, FDA needs the authority to require 
manufacturers to maintain and share Risk Management Plans.
    Having a proactive system and information to help better understand 
vulnerabilities and risks, and to work with manufacturers to prevent 
potential supply chain shortages before harm comes to patients and 
healthcare providers strengthens national security.
    Question. The infant formula crisis the country experienced 
highlighted the importance of moving away from a few large 
manufacturers to allowing smaller facilities more capacity. How is FDA 
working with smaller infant formula companies to expand their capacity?
    Answer. Recognizing the importance of a resilient and diversified 
supply chain, FDA has taken numerous steps to help all producers, 
regardless of size, have the ability to access and support the U.S. 
market for infant formula. In May 2022, to help address the infant 
formula shortage, FDA issued the ``Guidance for Industry: Infant 
Formula Enforcement Discretion Policy''\1\ to describe considerations 
for firms and formulas entering the market temporarily under FDA's 
exercise of enforcement discretion. During the initial period of 
enforcement discretion, when supply chain concerns were at their peak, 
FDA developed webpages about the new formulas that were entering the 
market under FDA's exercise of enforcement discretion, with information 
about how to safely switch to those formulas, if needed. Subsequently, 
in September 2022, FDA issued the ``Guidance for Industry: Infant 
Formula Transition Plan for Exercise of Enforcement Discretion''\2\ to 
outline a path for interested firms marketing products in the U.S. 
under the exercise of enforcement discretion to bring those products 
into compliance with all U.S. requirements to facilitate longer-term 
availability of those products in the market.

    Additionally, FDA hosted multiple webinars in autumn 2022 to 
support infant formula firms interested in marketing their products in 
the U.S., including those marketing as part of the transition plan and 
new market entrants more generally. Topics of the webinars included: 
the Infant Formula Transition Plan guidance, FDA's requirements and 
recommendations for new infant formula submissions, protein efficiency 
ratio (PER) studies, and growth monitoring studies (GMS). Following 
these webinars, in February 2023, FDA issued ``Draft Guidance for 
Industry: Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) Rat Bioassay Studies to 
Demonstrate that a New Infant Formula Supports the Quality Factor of 
Sufficient Biological Quality of Protein,'' \3\ with more information 
relating to a key component of a new infant formula submission. Most 
recently, FDA has announced two additional webinars to be held on 
Wednesday, May 24, 2023, and Wednesday, June 7, 2023, to provide 
stakeholders with information on regulatory requirements and 
considerations for infant formula ingredients and packaging.

    More broadly, on March 28, 2023, FDA published the Immediate 
National Strategy to Increase the Resiliency of the U.S. Infant Formula 
Market.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    *ERR14*\3\  The strategy describes immediate actions FDA took to 
address the shortage and details the Agency's plans for improving the 
resiliency of the infant formula market, while noting multiple issues 
that are beyond the purview of FDA. The immediate strategy represents a 
first step toward issuing, with input from the National Academy of 
Science, Engineering and Medicine, a long-term national strategy in 
2024 to improve preparedness against infant formula shortages by 
outlining methods to improve information-sharing, recommending measures 
for protecting the integrity of the infant formula supply chain, and 
preventing contamination. The longer-term strategy will explore new 
approaches to help facilitate entry of new infant formula manufacturers 
to increase supply and mitigate future shortages and assess whether 
additional regulatory authorities are needed to gain insight into the 
supply chain and risks for shortages.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    *ERR14*Question. Can you update the Committee on FDA's efforts 
ensure such a crisis never happens again?
    Answer. FDA has taken a great number of measures to reduce the 
potential of a similar incident occurring in the future. However, it 
should be noted that it is not possible to completely prevent all 
outbreaks, and the infant formula industry remains concentrated in the 
U.S. Further, the industry ultimately has the primary responsibility to 
produce safe, nutritious, and high-quality infant formula.
    Since February 2022, the Agency has had ongoing and extensive 
engagement with the infant formula industry to identify and implement 
opportunities to strengthen preventive control practices and engage on 
the development and refinement of the FDA's Strategy to Help Prevent 
Cronobacter sakazakii Illnesses Associated with Consumption of Powdered 
Infant Formula (released November 15, 2022). FDA food safety experts 
have engaged with industry, state, international, and other partners 
to: explore environmental factors that may contribute to contamination 
in facilities; review issues related to specific foodborne hazards to 
identify potential mitigation measures or knowledge gaps; review 
regulations to identify provisions that may be strengthened; identify 
prevention measures that can be taken to reduce future incidences of 
foodborne illness; and identify knowledge gaps to expand our 
understanding of food safety issues and limit recurrences of underlying 
root causes responsible for contamination.
    Already, the Agency is seeing actions advanced through the 
prevention strategy that will help to prevent recurrence of 
contamination. FDA food safety experts have advanced a charge through 
the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods 
(NACMCF) to gain scientific insight on possible industry and public 
health interventions to address Cronobacter infections associated with 
powdered infant formula. In addition, the Agency has engaged with the 
National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) to 
examine and report on challenges in the supply, market competition, and 
regulation of infant formula in the U.S.
    Furthermore, on March 28, 2023, FDA published an immediate national 
strategy\5\ to increase the resiliency of the U.S. infant formula 
supply chain, protect against future contamination and other potential 
causes of shortages, and ensure parents and caregivers have access to 
infant formula and the information they need. The strategy describes 
immediate actions FDA took to address the shortage and details the 
Agency's plans for improving the resiliency of the infant formula 
market, while noting multiple issues that are beyond the purview of 
FDA. It also traces the events that led up to and followed the 
voluntary recall of infant formula by Abbott Nutrition in February 
2022, the temporary pause in production at the Abbott Nutrition 
facility in Sturgis, Michigan, as well as numerous other factors that 
contributed to and exacerbated the shortage. The immediate strategy 
represents a first step toward issuing, with input from NASEM, a long- 
term national strategy in 2024 to improve preparedness and explore new 
approaches to help facilitate entry of new manufacturers to increase 
supply and mitigate future potential shortages.

resiliency-us-infant-formula-market
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To specifically ensure the issues encountered at Abbott Nutrition's 
Sturgis, MI, facility will not be repeated, FDA negotiated a consent 
decree with Abbott Nutrition, which was entered by the U.S. District 
Court for the Western District of Michigan on May 16, 2022. This 
consent decree requires Abbott to take steps necessary to safely 
produce infant formula in close coordination with FDA and under our 
oversight of its manufacturing and food safety processes. More broadly, 
FDA is committed to conducting surveillance food safety inspections of 
all infant formula manufacturers at least annually and to use remote 
regulatory assessments, as needed. Work is also underway to 
significantly expand and improve infant formula training for 
investigators and other appropriate staff to ensure every infant 
formula inspection is robust, thorough, and focused on the most 
critical aspects of the infant formula manufacturing process.
    FDA is also working to monitor the infant formula supply and supply 
chain to assess general market health and current and future demand, 
and identify potential signs of production and supply chain challenges 
by analyzing industry production data, in-stock rates, sales data, and 
information on key supply chain characteristics. Much of the work on 
infant formula will be coordinated through the creation of a new Office 
of Critical Foods responsible for oversight, coordination, and other 
activities related to critical foods, which is defined to include 
infant formula and medical foods. FDA will continue to build on these 
efforts throughout FY 2023 as a result of $7.5 million in additional 
funding provided by Congress for infant formula-related activities. 
This is enabling the Agency to hire 16 new full-time equivalents (FTE) 
in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. FDA's FY 2024 
request contains an additional $21 million to further expand its work 
in this area.
    However, the infant formula industry needs to take its 
responsibility to produce safe food more seriously. FDA has reviewed 
conditions during recent inspections of powdered infant formula 
manufacturers and has identified numerous areas for improvement across 
the infant formula industry. The Agency outlined these areas for 
improvement in a March 8, 2023, letter, which was a call to action for 
all members of the infant formula industry to help protect our most 
vulnerable population by, among other things, evaluating established 
systems of production and in-process controls and ensuring that 
appropriate controls are implemented at any point, step, or stage in 
the production process where control is necessary to prevent 
adulteration of infant formula. In addition, the infant formula 
industry is now required to establish and implement risk redundancy 
plans to minimize the impact of any future disruptions in production. 
Industry must ensure they are producing formula consistent with high 
U.S. food safety standards and maintaining their facilities so recalls 
and shutdowns are minimized.
    Question. The recent White House National Strategy on Hunger, 
Nutrition, and Health highlighted the need to empower consumers to make 
healthier food choices. The budget is requesting an additional $12 
million to strengthen the FDA's work on nutrition and labeling. Can you 
detail how this additional funding will be used?
    Answer. The additional requested funding of $12 million, which 
includes 19 FTE, will be used to enhance and strengthen the nutrition 
and labeling work performed by FDA. This includes the development of a 
standardized, science-based, front-of-package labeling scheme that 
would help consumers, particularly those with lower nutrition literacy, 
quickly and easily identify foods that can help them build a healthy 
dietary pattern. Front-of-package labeling would complement the 
Nutrition Facts label by displaying simplified, at-a-glance nutrition 
information and giving consumers additional context to help them 
quickly make more informed food selections.
    FDA will also continue to examine the use of the nutrient content 
claim, ``healthy,'' in food labeling to ensure that it aligns with 
current nutrition science and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. FDA 
will continue its rulemaking effort to update the nutrition criteria 
for when the ``healthy'' nutrient content claim can be put on a 
product, which will help to provide consumers with information to make 
more informed dietary choices. FDA will also continue its work to 
develop a symbol companies can use on food packages to depict the 
nutrient content claim, ``healthy.'' In addition, FDA will work to 
finalize a guidance on using Dietary Guidance Statements on food 
labeling in order to help consumers understand how a particular food 
can contribute to a healthy eating pattern. Additional funding will 
also go towards advances in e- commerce, such as gathering additional 
public input to inform a possible guidance for the food industry on 
nutrition, ingredient, and allergen information that should be 
available for groceries sold online.
    FDA will also assess progress in reducing sodium in processed 
packaged and prepared foods and begin the process to develop revised, 
voluntary sodium reduction targets as part of the Agency's broad and 
continued approach to facilitating the reduction of sodium intake, as 
outlined in the White House National Strategy. In October 2021, the 
Agency issued voluntary, short-term (2.5 year) sodium reduction 
targets. The request will support FDA in finalizing a regulation that 
will provide companies with additional flexibility in the use of safe 
and suitable salt substitutes in standardized foods, for which salt is 
an optional or required ingredient, giving industry additional tools to 
produce foods lower in sodium content.
    Question. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) of 2013 
established a uniform, interoperable framework for tracing 
pharmaceutical products throughout the supply chain. On the DSCSA's 
final implementation deadline of November 27, 2023, supply chain 
trading partners will be required to provide and receive serialized 
transaction data along with serialized product upon a change of 
ownership. The supply chain is at a critical point and it appears that 
industry may not be fully ready which could lead to supply chain 
challenges.
    The pandemic brought to light many issues in the drug supply chain. 
To this day we still struggle with shortages of drugs including 
Adderall and Albuterol, among others. If the DSCSA is not properly 
implemented, it could cause more shortages. Is the FDA concerned about 
drug shortages if product is not able to move through the supply chain?
    Answer. The DSCSA program is critical to improve the detection and 
removal of potentially dangerous drugs from the supply chain and help 
protect patients from receiving a drug that may be counterfeit, stolen, 
contaminated, or otherwise harmful. The Agency has heard from trading 
partners and other stakeholders about implementation challenges, 
particularly related to data and data exchange issues, and concerns 
that not everyone in the supply chain will have their systems and 
processes in place to meet the November 2023 requirements. FDA 
considers all stakeholder concerns and examines all available 
regulatory options to minimize the chance of supply chain disruptions.
    Question. If manufacturers aren't ready, how will that affect 
pharmacies and patients?
    Answer. FDA has heard that while there has been industry progress 
towards enhanced drug distribution security requirements, stakeholders 
are concerned about the current status of readiness of trading partners 
in the supply chain and implementation challenges. Stakeholders 
indicated that some of these challenges may lead to supply chain 
issues, potentially affecting the distribution and availability of 
certain prescription drugs. The Agency is actively continuing 
stakeholder outreach and engagement on these issues. In addition, FDA 
will be conducting a small dispenser assessment that will examine 
necessary software and hardware accessibility, and the cost to obtain, 
install, maintain, and integrate them into business practices. The 
assessment will help FDA identify and consider compliance challenges 
faced by small dispensers (i.e. small pharmacies).

              Questions Submitted by Senator Tammy Baldwin
    Question. How is the agency considering the widespread concern from 
consumers, farmers and producers over FDA not enforcing dairy standards 
of identity?
    Answer. FDA establishes food standards of identity to promote 
honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers, and this remains 
an Agency priority. The Agency recognizes that there has been 
significant development and commercial activity in the area of plant-
based alternatives to traditional food products, including plant-based 
beverages labeled with names that include the terms of dairy standards 
of identity, such as ``milk.'' In February 2023, FDA issued a draft 
guidance\6\ entitled ``Labeling of Plant-Based Milk Alternatives and 
Voluntary Nutrient Statements.'' This draft guidance explains that, 
while plant-based milk alternatives are not permitted to be offered for 
sale as ``milk,'' the use of the term ``milk'' as part of the name of 
plant- based milk alternatives does not mean that such products are 
represented as ``milk'' as defined in FDA regulations. The draft 
guidance also provides recommendations for labeling plant-based 
beverages with additional nutrition information to help consumers 
compare these products to milk and make informed dietary choices. 
Empowering consumers with nutrition information they can use to 
identify healthier choices more easily is a priority under FDA's 
Nutrition Initiatives. FDA is interested in hearing from stakeholders 
and encourages all interested persons to submit comments to the draft 
guidance docket by July 31, 2023.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question. How will these concerns be implemented into the final 
Guidance for Industry: Labeling of Plant-Based Milk Alternatives and 
Voluntary Nutrient Statements?
    Answer. On May 1, 2023, FDA reopened the public comment period for 
90 more days to allow additional time for interested persons to develop 
and submit comments to the draft guidance. The deadline for comments is 
July 31, 2023. The Agency welcomes comments on any aspect of the draft 
guidance. This topic is of great interest to a variety of stakeholders 
with differing perspectives and FDA anticipates receiving useful 
information from comments. All comments, data, and research timely 
submitted to the docket will be reviewed and considered before 
beginning work on a final guidance.
    Question. How does the FDA plan to evaluate animal feed additives 
with environmental claims, such as those intended to target enteric 
methane emissions, in a safe and timely manner?
    Answer. FDA understands Congress's and stakeholders' interest in a 
robust and timely pathway for environmentally beneficial products to 
enter the market for use in animal food.
    The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act sets the regulatory 
paradigm to which products used in animal food are subject. Articles 
(other than food) intended to affect the structure or function of the 
body of an animal are drugs under the Act. Some products with 
environmental claims, such as those non-nutritive substances that 
affect an animal's function to reduce methane emissions, meet the 
definition of a drug.
    FDA remains engaged with Congress and stakeholders to consider 
potential solutions. The Agency is also considering alternative 
approaches for the regulation of these products in the absence of 
legislation. In the interim, FDA is working with sponsors to identify 
alternative pathways to market, where appropriate, on a case-by-case 
basis.
    Question. The FDA is now 19 months past a court ordered deadline to 
finish its review of e- cigarette applications, and 8 months past a 
deadline set by Congress to review applications of synthetic nicotine 
products. Unauthorized vaping products remain on the market. Why have 
these products been allowed to stay on the market, and what is the 
current backlog of applications?
    Answer. FDA continues to make significant progress on reviewing 
applications despite their sheer volume and the rapidly evolving 
tobacco product landscape. To date, FDA has received premarket tobacco 
product applications for 26 million products, the vast majority of 
which are for e- cigarettes, and has successfully completed its review 
of 99 percent of them. This includes one million applications for non-
tobacco nicotine products, including synthetic nicotine--for which FDA 
has successfully completed review of 99.5% of applications. FDA has 
been working diligently to ensure we are processing applications as 
quickly as possible while also ensuring the decisions are 
scientifically accurate, legally defensible, and aligned with the 
authorities granted by Congress.
    FDA has been clear that all new tobacco products on the market 
without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed 
unlawfully and are subject to enforcement by FDA. We will continue to 
closely monitor the marketplace and take compliance and enforcement 
actions on a case-by-case basis according to our enforcement priorities 
and the individual circumstances. Compliance and enforcement actions 
include: warning letters, civil money penalties, seizures, and 
injunctions, among others. Importantly, FDA does not have independent 
litigation authority. Therefore, we work with the U.S. Department of 
Justice (DOJ) to inform our enforcement actions. The DOJ must evaluate 
the legal risks of pursuing particular actions and decide whether to 
litigate cases on our behalf.
    Question. On April 26, 2022, the Director of the Center of Drug 
Evaluation and Research testified under oath at a Senate HELP Committee 
hearing that ``The Center for Drugs currently does not have a contract 
with McKinsey and across FDA. [W]e anticipate that further contracts 
will not be issued pending the outcome of the investigations.'' This 
followed a 2022 congressional investigation that found that at least 22 
McKinsey consultants worked for both FDA and opioid manufacturers on 
related topics, including at the same time. Can you confirm that over 
the last year, McKinsey has not been hired by the FDA and will not be 
hired in the future?
    Answer. FDA does not have any active contracts with McKinsey. Due 
to rules governing competition, it would be inappropriate to comment on 
future plans absent an explicit prohibition or debarment of McKinsey. 
The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), particularly Part 6, 
prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open competition 
in the acquisition process.

               Questions Submitted by Senator Joe Manchin
    Question. The enriched enrollment or EERW process has made it 
significantly easier for the FDA to approve opioids and allow for broad 
marketing to the public. The process removes patients with pre-existing 
opioid sensitives from clinical trials, instead of sticking with 
traditional double-blind studies. This has skewed results and seriously 
underestimates risks associated with the proposed drug involved in the 
clinical trial.
    The External Report of FDA Regulations of Opioid Analgesics notes 
that ``there are several limitations of EERW design that warrant 
additional consideration for opioid[s]''.

  --Will the FDA commit to following the recommendations of the report 
        and hold another Advisory Committee meeting focused on FDA's 
        use of enriched enrollment for opioid approvals?
    Answer. The Agency understands your concern with enriched 
enrollment randomized withdrawal (EERW) trials. As you know, the Agency 
recently held an Advisory Committee meeting with the Drug Safety and 
Risk Management Advisory Committee to review EERW trial design.\14\

    The Agency is reviewing the discussion from the Advisory Committee 
and if there is further need to obtain independent expert advice on 
scientific, technical, and policy matters related to EERW design FDA 
will at that time consider the need for an additional Advisory 
Committee meeting regarding EERW design.
    Question. The Fiscal Year 2022 Consolidated Appropriations report 
included language directing the FDA to ``conduct a study to review EERW 
study designs used in the approval of new prescription opioids for 
chronic pain.'' This study is intended to specifically look at the use 
of EERWs use to approve new opioids. Will the FDA commit to completing 
this study?
    Answer. As noted in Question 1, the Agency is conducting an ongoing 
review of the use of EERW trial design. An element of the review was 
the Advisory Committee held on April 19th, 2023.\15\

    Question. I introduced the FDA Accountability for Public Safety Act 
to ensure Advisory Committees are properly used. Specifically, if a 
Committee votes against approval and you decide to go against this 
vote, you must submit a report to Congress that includes the medical 
and scientific evidence to justify its approval. How will the FDA 
ensure Advisory Committee discussions are clear and transparent?
    Answer. FDA's advisory committee meetings are conducted in 
accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires that 
timely notice of advisory committee meetings be published in the 
Federal Register, that the meetings generally be open to the public, 
and that records of all meetings be maintained and available to the 
public, subject to limited exceptions. To that end, and to be as 
transparent as possible, FDA maintains a public website for each of its 
advisory committees that includes agendas, presentation materials, 
minutes, and transcripts of all meetings of the committee. FDA's 
advisory committee meetings can also be viewed live via webcast and 
when meetings are held on FDA's campus or at other locations, members 
of the public and press are able to attend in person. Advisory 
committees make non-binding recommendations to the FDA, which generally 
follows the recommendations, but is not legally bound to do so. The 
available science and data guide the Agency's decisionmaking.
    Question. Between November 2021 and November 2022, the CDC reported 
that over 78,000 people died of an opioid related overdose. While we 
know opioids can be prescribed with legitimate prescriptions to treat 
pain, we also know that even with prescriptions, opioids can kill. 
These pills kill via respiratory depression, essentially, they make you 
go to sleep and forget to breathe. However, we do know of several non-
opioid treatments to treat pain that don't result in respiratory 
depression. What is the FDA doing to speed up approval of non-opioid 
treatments for pain?
    Answer. Addressing the overdose crisis continues to be one of FDA's 
top public health priorities, and the Agency agrees that there is still 
much work to do as deaths from drug overdoses remain at historically 
high levels. One of FDA's four Overdose Prevention Priorities under our 
Overdose Prevention Framework \16\ is supporting primary prevention by 
eliminating unnecessary initial prescription drug exposure and 
inappropriate prolonged prescribing. A key activity under this priority 
is the development of novel, non-opioid pain therapies, which the 
Agency believes will ultimately help prevent new cases of overdose and 
reduce deaths. FDA is committed to doing its part to help spur this 
development. To support such developments, the Agency recently 
published draft guidances titled ``Development of Non-Opioid Analgesics 
for Acute Pain''\17\ (February 2022) and ``Development of Local 
Anesthetic Drug Products With Prolonged Duration of Effect'' (March 
2023). These guidances are intended to assist sponsors in the 
development of alternatives to opioids for the management of pain. 
Additionally, FDA is developing a guidance for industry on the 
development of non-addictive medical products for the management of 
chronic pain, as stated on the 2023 CDER guidance agenda.

               Questions Submitted by Senator John Hoeven
    Question. In fiscal year (FY) 2023, Congress provided $5 million in 
new funding to implement an FDA-wide New Alternative Methods (NAMs) 
Program with the goal of advancing the development, qualification, and 
implementation of NAMs for product testing. It is important that the 
funds are used to provide regulatory clarity to sponsors and the 
community as to what constitutes a ``regulatory-grade'' NAM. Please 
provide an update on the implementation plan for the NAMs program.
    Answer. FDA appreciates that Congress provided $5 million in new 
funding in FY 2023 to implement an FDA-wide New Alternative Methods 
(NAMs) Program. With dedicated resources for alternative methods, FDA 
is beginning to implement a program to evaluate the suitability and 
validity of these methods to best inform the Agency's regulatory 
decisionmaking process. Centrally coordinated and managed by FDA's 
Office of the Chief Scientist, this core program focuses on 
establishing cohesive and comprehensive strategies to advance the 
development, qualification, and implementation of NAMs for regulatory 
use. The program broadens and complements longstanding work led by FDA 
Centers and Offices, including specific programmatic objectives such as 
expanding capacity to qualify alternative methods and filling 
information gaps with applied research to support new policy and 
guidance development.
    The FY 2024 President's Budget builds on the FY 2023 Budget by 
requesting an additional $1.5 million in funding within the Office of 
the Chief Scientist to further support the NAMs Program by providing 
strategic coordination, implementation, and oversight, as well as to 
develop a qualification process to assess NAMs for regulatory use.
    As follow up to a presentation for the Science Board to FDA at its 
June 2022 meeting,\7\ the Agency is working to establish a Science 
Board subcommittee that will be charged with continued discussion on 
the topic of NAMs and will look to consider the board's recommendations 
as part of the overarching efforts for continued progress. The Agency 
is also assessing its current activities to identify capabilities, 
critical gaps, and potential actions that could be taken to continue 
and enhance ongoing efforts to advance development and adoption of 
alternative methods.

    Question. It is my understanding that Canada just updated their 
Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) policy and continue to base their policy on 
whether foods support or do not support growth of the pathogen. Will 
FDA also incorporate a risk-based approach that is reflective of the 
current scientific evidence?
    Answer. FDA is developing three guidance documents on the following 
topics:

  --The Agency's enforcement policy for Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) in 
        foods.

  --Classifying food as ready to eat (RTE) or not ready to eat (NRTE).

  --Control of Listeria monocytogenes in RTE foods.

    In the development of these documents, FDA is considering updated 
scientific information, including current thinking regarding the 
enforcement policy for foods based on whether foods support the growth 
of Lm. All three documents are a priority for FDA, and the CPG and 
guidance on classifying food as RTE or NRTE are on FDA's 2023 ``Foods 
Program Guidance Documents Under Development.''8 The Agency's goal is 
to issue Listeria policies that are grounded in the best available 
science, protective of public health, and practical for industry to 
implement.

    Question. The Reagan-Udall Foundation evaluation on the tobacco 
program raised significant questions about the lack of a cohesive plan 
at the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), finding, ``the lack of 
clarity about CTP's direction, its priorities and its near-term and 
longer-term goals and objectives, hinders CTP's ability to effectively 
carry out its mission establish efficient programs to accomplish its 
goals and objectives, and set appropriate metrics to assess outcomes.''
    For fiscal year (FY) 2024, the President's budget requests a $100 
million increase for tobacco user-fees. How would this additional 
funding be employed, and does the agency have a plan to address the 
issues raised in the Reagan-Udall Foundation's Evaluation Report?
    Answer. FDA welcomed the opportunity for the independent external 
review by the Reagan-Udall Foundation and is committed to addressing 
all the recommendations outlined in its evaluation report as 
expeditiously as possible. In February 2023, FDA announced the Center 
for Tobacco Products' (CTP's) plans for addressing the 
recommendations.\9\ FDA also developed a new webpage\10\ describing 
CTP's activities to address the recommendations, by topic area, that 
will be updated routinely to reflect progress.

    A key recommendation of the report was that CTP create and 
implement a new strategic plan that identifies the Center's strategic 
objectives and plots an operational roadmap of the steps CTP will take 
over the next 5 years to achieve those objectives. Development of the 
strategic plan commenced in February 2023, and will build upon prior 
strategic plans the Center has created and implemented since its 
inception. For the new strategic plan, CTP will engage with both 
internal and external stakeholders during development. We anticipate 
release of the plan no later than December 2023.
    The Reagan-Udall Foundation report also specifically recommended 
that ``additional resources should be sought, particularly to provide 
some parity among the tobacco sectors assessed under user fees for the 
Center's work.'' Currently, FDA is only authorized to assess user fees 
on tobacco products that fall within six product classes.\11\ The 
authorized collection amount is fixed and is not indexed to 
inflation.\12\ FDA believes that an additional $100 million in user 
fees, indexed to inflation, represents an appropriate increase in 
resources to ensure comprehensive regulation of the changing tobacco 
product marketplace. An additional $100 million will enable FDA to 
expand much-needed activities for the newly regulated products, with 
three-quarters of the additional resources being dedicated to 
compliance and enforcement and product review; the remaining resources 
would be allocated to scientific research, regulation and guidance 
development, and public education.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ Per section 919 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 
these six classes are: cigars, pipe tobacco, cigarettes, snuff, chewing 
tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco. FDA does not currently have 
authority to assess and collect user fees for ENDS products.
    \12\ Section 919 authorizes the total amount of user fees FDA must 
assess and collect each year. For the first 10 years of the FDA tobacco 
program, the total amount of user fee collections increased each year. 
Beginning in FY2019, the authorized amount is fixed at $712 million.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question. The issue of access to compounded hormones remains a 
concern for millions of patients who rely on access to compounded 
therapies. In response to a question for the record I posed last year, 
the agency cited the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and 
Medicine's (NASEM) report stating, ``FDA intends to consider the 
information in the NASEM report.'' The FDA did not mention any other 
scientific studies on this topic in its response.
    Will FDA review all relevant stakeholder comments and consider 
additional peer-reviewed scientific studies as part of the agency's 
review of the NASEM report and its recommendations?
    Answer. When developing Agency policies, FDA intends to consider 
all relevant information, including the NASEM report and stakeholder 
comments and submissions, while taking into account patient access 
concerns. Moreover, before implementing a new policy, the Agency 
generally provides an opportunity for public comment, whether the 
policy is announced through a draft guidance, Federal Register Notice, 
or proposed rulemaking.
    As background, compounded ``bioidentical hormone replacement 
therapy'' (cBHRT) products are not FDA-approved, which means these 
products have not undergone an FDA assessment of safety, effectiveness, 
or quality prior to marketing.
    To help inform the public and the FDA's policies regarding cBHRT, 
the Agency entered into an agreement with the National Academies of 
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) to convene an ad hoc 
committee to conduct a study on the clinical utility of cBHRT drug 
products. The committee also reviewed which populations may benefit 
from the use of these preparations and considered whether the available 
evidence supports their use to treat patients. The committee issued its 
report, ``The Clinical Utility of Compounded Bioidentical Hormone 
Therapy,'' on July 1, 2020.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/clinical-utility-
of-treating-patients-with-compounded-bioidentical- hormone-replacement-
therapy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Reports published by NASEM aim to provide independent, objective 
expert advice. With regard to cBHRT, NASEM held six open session 
meetings for the Committee on Clinical Utility of Treating Patients 
with Compounded Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy. According to 
NASEM, these meetings provided an opportunity for the committee to 
gather data and contextual information from relevant BHRT compounders 
and BHRT medical professionals.
    The NASEM report discusses some of the uncertainties of the 
potential benefits and safety risks associated with the use of these 
compounded products. FDA believes the results of NASEM's research 
provide important information that will increase public understanding 
regarding cBHRT products.

            Questions Submitted by Senator Susan M. Collins
    Question. Clinical Holds. I wanted to follow up on the issue of 
clinical holds, which I raised during the hearing. Clinical holds can 
be an important and appropriate tool for the Agency to utilize when a 
potential concern with an application has surfaced, but they are not a 
substitute for timely, constructive, and clear communication to 
sponsors. Further, when clinical holds are imposed for an ongoing 
development program, there should be urgency brought to resolving it.
    The anecdotal evidence suggests that the review process for cell 
and gene therapy is becoming more protracted, and I am concerned that 
the lack of face-to-face meetings may be negatively affecting the FDA's 
ability to keep pace and retain its scientific and regulatory stature 
as the gold standard.
    How many clinical holds have been issued in the past year? What 
percentage of cell and gene therapy applications have been subject to a 
clinical hold? Please include whether the Agency either sought or 
granted live meetings to discuss and potentially resolve the Agency's 
questions that led to the clinical hold.
    Answer. Of the 262 cell and gene therapy Investigational New Drug 
applications (INDs) received in calendar year 2022, 54 (20.6%) were 
placed on clinical hold in the initial 30 days after receiving the 
application. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) 
and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) began accepting 
requests for in-person, face-to-face industry meetings on February 13, 
2023, for certain meeting types. As such, no in-person, face- to-face 
meetings were held for INDs put on clinical hold within CY 2022. 
However, throughout that time, FDA has continued to hold ``live'' 
meetings (e.g., via teleconference) when appropriate.
    It is important to note that the likelihood an IND application will 
be allowed to proceed is related to the quality and completeness of 
each IND section (Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC), 
Pharmacology and Toxicology (P/T), and Clinical), whether all the 
identified safety risks are adequately addressed, and whether the 
sponsor provides timely responses to Agency information requests. There 
may be additional challenges encountered by the review team during the 
review of an original IND, which may include:

  --Grossly inadequate or missing sections of the IND for CMC, P/T or 
        Clinical review.

  --Inadequate donor eligibility information.

  --Inclusion of a device (e.g., delivery device, companion 
        diagnostic), human factors study, or combination product 
        classification that requires a consultative review(s) from 
        another Center. Based on our experience, oftentimes such 
        inclusions are inadequately or poorly addressed in submissions.

  --Requirement for clinical subspecialty review from another Center.

  --Cross reference of a Master File or IND in another product Office 
        within the Center or another Center, requiring a consultative 
        review.

    FDA remains committed to working with all sponsors to resolve 
issues and help speed development of new products, while maintaining 
high, scientifically based safety and efficacy standards.
    Question. Written Responses. I remain interested in the Agency's 
progress towards restoring face-to-face (FTF) meetings with sponsors 
and relying less on Written Response Only (WRO) communications. While I 
am pleased that FDA announced on January 30, 2023, that is was 
restoring some FTF meetings, the Agency has not expanded the FTF option 
for all types of meetings. The opportunity for critical discussion and 
meaningful scientific exchange are diminished under a WRO. FDA needs to 
preserve WRO as a tool for routine exchanges and clarifying responses 
to sponsors, but should otherwise be working to restore live options 
for most types of meetings and requests.
    What is the current timeline for full restoration of FTF 
interactions across each meeting type?
    Answer. The Agency understands the desire to conduct face-to-face 
(FTF) meetings. There are three formats for formal meetings with FDA, 
namely FTF (can be either in-person or virtual), Teleconference, and 
Written Response Only (WRO). As noted, WROs are one of these meeting 
formats and are an important and efficient tool under the appropriate 
circumstances. For each meeting request, the Agency carefully considers 
the specific questions posed by the drug developer, as well as the 
context (e.g., stage of development, product complexity, clinical 
indication and unmet need). When the Agency expects that our responses 
will be straightforward (e.g., referral to content of a specific 
guidance document) or will reiterate points made in previous 
discussions with the sponsor, then FDA has commonly provided written 
responses. When the questions are complex, for example with a product 
that raises new scientific questions, or an innovative trial design, 
the Agency has been more likely to offer a FTF meeting via 
videoconference or in-person.
    While WROs have been and will continue to be an important tool, FDA 
has continued to hold ``live'' meetings (e.g., discussion via 
teleconference or virtual face-to-face) with sponsors and applicants 
over the past 3 years for any meeting type when appropriate. The 
announcement on January 30 provided new information about the 
reintroduction of in-person FTF meetings, which were precluded during 
the pandemic. The reintroduced in-person FTF meetings (which will 
include a hybrid component to allow broader participation) will 
continue to expand until all meeting types are included.

                                 ______
                                 

            Questions Submitted by Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith
    Question. Over a million patients a day use medical gases under the 
supervision of healthcare professionals across the country. We 
congratulate the FDA for releasing a notice of proposed rulemaking for 
medical gases on May 23, 2022. However, the FY 2017 Consolidated 
Appropriations Act required a final rule to be issued by July 15, 
2017--nearly 6 years ago. The public comment period ended on August 23, 
2022 and FDA received a total of 4 public comments on the proposed 
rule. I was dismayed to see in the Fall 2022 Unified Agenda that FDA 
had put the rulemaking on the backburner, listing it as a long-term 
action with a projected publication date of October 2024. That means 
FDA is projecting it needs 29 months to respond to four public comments 
to finalize the medical gas rulemaking.
    It is deeply frustrating that the subcommittee is being told--six 
years after a statutory deadline--that it will be another year before 
FDA issues a final rule on medical gases. The FY 2023 Joint Explanatory 
Statement requires the FDA to produce quarterly reports on progress 
until the final rule is published. We would rather have the final rule 
rather than make you produce more reports. Can you commit to this 
Committee that you will accelerate the final rule and publish it in 
2023?
    Answer. FDA is working in earnest to finalize and publish the 
medical gas final rule by the projected publication date, but we cannot 
guarantee publication on a given timeline because certain aspects of 
the rulemaking and clearance process are outside of FDA's control. This 
rulemaking is large and complex because it is intended to address a 
wide range of topics and is anticipated to include changes to existing 
regulations as well as the addition of entirely new regulations. 
Developing this rule has also required coordination across numerous 
Agency components, given the range of subjects involved, including 
labeling, current good manufacturing practice, certification, and 
safety reporting. In making changes based on the comments we received 
to the proposed rule, we must also ensure that any revisions do not 
create issues for other regulatory areas. We would be happy to provide 
updates, as appropriate.

                                 ______
                                 

               Questions Submitted by Senator Deb Fischer
    Question. Feed additives can include enzymes, vitamins, and 
minerals that help livestock to increase feed efficiencies and reduce 
environmental impact. However, slow approvals prevent advancements in 
these additives and their benefits. Can you discuss how additional 
resources in the past few years have helped the Center for Veterinary 
Medicine speed up the review process?
    Answer. FDA received an additional $5 million in FY 2020 and an 
additional $1 million in FY 2022 for animal food ingredient reviews, 
which allowed the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) to successfully 
hire more staff and improve timeliness for pre-market review of 
multifaceted and innovative new animal food ingredients. The animal 
food ingredient industry is rapidly evolving and submissions of 
innovative new animal food ingredients have become more complex and 
contain more scientific data for CVM to analyze. Since receiving these 
increased resources, FDA has increased its on-time rate from 44% of 
reviews to 73% of reviews this past year, all while moving over twice 
as many reviews through the system. Additionally, CVM's Office of 
Surveillance and Compliance underwent a reorganization in 2022 to more 
fully align its resources and work, which included establishing the 
Division of Animal Food Ingredients (DAFI). All 36 FTEs in DAFI are 
focused on work related to the pre-market review of new animal food 
ingredients, which includes reviewing new submissions, developing 
policy, evaluating science, and administering functions associated with 
the pre-market animal food ingredient processes.
    Question. I also understand the Center for Veterinary Medicine is 
working to update their policy manual to better address innovative new 
products in the feed industry. How is that going and are there other 
items that the Center for Veterinary Medicine is doing to improve the 
animal food ingredient review process?
    Answer. CVM is reviewing its Policy and Procedures Manual (PPM) 
Guide 1240.3605, Regulating Animal Foods with Drug Claims, in part to 
keep pace with innovative uses of substances in food for animals. In 
October 2022, the Center held a public listening session to gain 
stakeholder input on potential changes resulting from this review. 
Substances that benefit animal production, the environment, human food 
safety, or the animal's microbiome, and positively impact animal 
agriculture are a part of the discussions as to the best way to 
regulate them to ensure safety, effectiveness, and provide innovative 
products to animal producers.
    At this point in FDA's evaluation, the Agency believes it will 
issue an updated Guidance for Industry. However, it should be noted 
that evaluating claims about the effects of food ingredients will 
increase the workload for the ingredient review staff and new claims 
will also present the need for new expertise for their evaluation. To 
prepare for the anticipated additional workload, CVM continues to 
update and streamline operating processes and procedures. CVM is also 
engaging and training the animal food industry on effective ways to 
submit data to expedite the review process.
    Question. In the FY24 Budget Request, you noted that FDA will 
develop a standardized system to help consumers quickly and easily 
identify foods that are part of a healthy eating pattern. FDA will also 
make sure ``healthy'' labeling aligns with current nutrition science 
and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans with a proposal to update the 
nutrition standards for when ``healthy'' claims can be put on products, 
and will also develop a symbol to be used to depict and easily 
communicate a food as ``healthy.'' Can you discuss what coordination 
has been done with USDA in regards to the healthy label? Specifically, 
how would meat products under USDA labeling jurisdiction be treated by 
FDA's proposed rule?
    Answer. The proposed rule developed by FDA was shared with USDA, 
which reviewed it and engaged with FDA throughout the clearance 
process. FDA carefully considered USDA's input before publishing the 
proposed rule. The proposed rule only applies to foods subject to FDA's 
labeling regulations. This includes the meat products that are 
regulated by FDA, specifically game meat and seafood. Meat and poultry 
products under USDA jurisdiction are subject to the regulations set 
forth by USDA. However, the definitions for nutrient content claims for 
FDA and USDA are typically identical or very similar due to our inter-
departmental collaborative efforts.
    Question. What assurances has the agency provided to food 
manufacturers to avoid potential lawsuits for being out of compliance 
with the updated ``healthy'' definition during the proposed compliance 
period after a new definition is updated?
    Answer. Even after any new requirements for the definition of the 
nutrient content claim ``healthy'' are in effect, manufacturers may 
begin to comply with the new requirements or they may continue to use 
the old definition of ``healthy'' until the compliance date arrives. 
FDA notes that manufacturers would not be required to comply with 
requirements of the final rule until the compliance date. The Agency 
has proposed an effective date 60 days after the date of publication of 
the final rule in the Federal Register, with a proposed compliance date 
3 years after the effective date. This timeframe would provide industry 
time to revise labeling to come into compliance with the new 
requirements.

   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND 
          RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2024

                              ----------                              

                                       U.S. Senate,
           Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations,

                       NONDEPARTMENTAL WITNESSES

    [The following testimonies were received by the 
Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
Administration, and Related Agencies for inclusion in the 
record. The submitted materials relate to the fiscal year 2024 
budget request for programs within the subcommittee's 
jurisdiction.]
         Prepared Statement of the Alliance for a Stronger FDA
    The Alliance for a Stronger FDA thanks the subcommittee for its 
continuing support of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The 
resources you have provided FDA serve the American people, assure a 
safe food supply and help deliver safe and effective medical products.
    We support the Administration's request for $3.914 billion in BA 
funding for FDA in fiscal Year 24. As you evaluate the merits of this 
request, we ask that you keep these three thoughts in mind:
    FDA has a uniquely difficult mission while providing a core 
function of government:

  --Few (if any) Federal agencies have a broader range of 
        responsibilities than the FDA.

  --No Federal agency's mission and responsibilities are more affected 
        by changes in science, technology, innovation, commerce, and 
        social trends than the FDA.

    FDA needs more resources each year because of its expanding mission 
and growing responsibilities:

  --Increased complexity and progress in science, technology, and 
        innovation;

  --Continued growth of FDA-regulated industries, including 
        globalization;

  --FDA's responsibilities regularly increase, including with unfunded 
        mandates; and

  --Likelihood of unexpected public health and scientific needs/
        challenges every year

    FDA's mission and responsibilities are incredibly consequential and 
visible:

  --Every day, thousands of tasks are completed successfully and 
        uneventfully by the FDA.

  --FDA's dedicated employees (largely unseen) devote millions of hours 
        each year to successfully maintaining FDA's high standards for 
        safe food and safe and effective medical products.

  --Problems should be addressed; often that requires additional 
        resources and authorities.
                               background
    The Alliance for a Stronger FDA includes 150 stakeholder 
organizations that advocate for FDA resources commensurate with its 
growing responsibilities. Our members are consumer and patient groups, 
research advocates, health professional societies, trade groups, 
companies, and individuals.
    We believe that the primary beneficiary of FDA's activities is the 
American public. Accordingly, it is critical that the public remains 
the largest source of FDA funding.
    Our request for fiscal Year 24 funding focuses exclusively on 
appropriations that come from monies paid by taxpayers (BA) and 
intentionally does not include user fees and mandated funding (e.g., 
Cures monies transferred from the National Institutes of Health). 
However, we urge Congress to fully fund those programs, as well.
    FDA's jurisdiction includes responsibility for more than 80 percent 
of the food supply and all drugs, medical devices, biologics, vaccines, 
veterinary food/medicine, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. 
Altogether, the agency oversees products that represent 20 percent of 
all consumer spending ($2.8 trillion) and touch the American public 
multiple times each day.
    Because the FDA's mission continues to grow and its vital 
activities have become more sophisticated and complex, the Alliance 
supports the Administration's budget authority (BA) request of $3.914 
billion for FY24. This provides for an increase of $366 million in BA 
salary and expenses (S&E) and an increase of $6 million in BA buildings 
and facilities (B&F).
    The Alliance encourages FDA to increase transparency and 
accountability in its use of funding.
           fda needs funding to meet 21st century challenges
    We support strengthening the scientific capabilities of FDA 
throughout the five Centers, ORA, NCTR, and the Office of the 
Commissioner. This includes personnel capable of conducting FDA's 
ongoing responsibilities while looking for innovative ways to meet 
future demands. To support science-based decision-making and keep up 
with innovation in both food and medical products, the FDA needs more 
scientific and technical staff, and better analytical tools.
    The growing complexity of science, interwoven with new advances in 
technology, is a challenge across the agency. In food safety, this 
means the use of artificial intelligence, whole genome sequencing, and 
enhanced electronic recordkeeping that will contribute to a safer food 
supply. In medical products, this means new tools to evaluate medical 
products that incorporate cell and gene therapy, digital health, 
artificial intelligence, and real-world evidence. Addressing 
cybersecurity concerns is a priority.
                     areas of need and opportunity
    The Administration's request, which the Alliance supports, has four 
components, to which we have added the Alliance's comments.
             enhancing food safety, nutrition and cosmetics
  --$128.2 million in investments in food safety and nutrition 
        modernization, including food labeling and animal food safety 
        oversight. While the agency is in the process of defining its 
        future vision for the Human Foods Program, there is significant 
        need for additional resources to strengthen its foundational 
        food safety and nutrition capacity.

    Alliance comment: The fiscal Year 24 FDA budget request places a 
strong emphasis on strengthening food and nutrition programs. The 
request is based on needs-based assessments made last summer and 
represents steps that can and should be supported in fiscal Year 24.
    Priorities should include: more robust and rapid implementation of 
the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA); a strong start on initiatives 
in the agency's New Era of Smarter Food Safety; finalization of 
guidances; a focus on produce safety, import safety, and training/
education; enhanced funding of systems for surveillance of foodborne 
illnesses and outbreak response; and strengthening the scientific 
capabilities of CFSAN/CVM/NCTR.
    FDA's BA appropriation should include increased support and 
predictability for the agency's extremely valuable cooperative 
relationships with State and local regulatory programs (including 
public health laboratories).

  --$5 million toward modernizing oversight of cosmetics. The budget 
        includes new funding for the development of regulations, 
        compliance policies, product registration and listing 
        platforms, adverse event reporting and other activities.

    Alliance comment: This past December, Congress passed The 
Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022, a major overhaul of 
the regulation of cosmetics, amending a law that was passed in 1938. 
There is no money in the fiscal Year 23 (current year) appropriation to 
pay for implementation. The President's request for $5 million in 
fiscal Year 24 is a good start. Congress should recognize that more 
money will be needed.
        advancing access to safe and effective medical products
  --$23 million in additional funds to advance the goal of ending the 
        opioid crisis. Funding will support broader development of 
        treatments for substance use disorders and enhance regulatory 
        oversight, expand compliance, enforcement, and laboratory 
        support.

  --$11.6 million increase toward improving the medical device supply 
        chain and shortage programs. The agency will continue to build 
        its capabilities to ensure patients have access to medical 
        devices at all times.

  --$2.5 million to implement ACT for ALS to foster development of 
        treatments for ALS and other rare neurodegenerative diseases. 
        To help the FDA implement the ACT for ALS Act.

    Alliance comment: These proposed investments are responses to 
important problems, and we support the Administration's request for 
each. The medical device supply chain is especially pressing. The 
request for ACT for ALS responds to newly enacted legislation and 
reflects the particular difficulties in evaluating treatments for 
neurodegenerative diseases.
    We expect that FDA will be continuing a number of similar medical 
products initiatives funded in prior fiscal years, including programs 
targeted at advanced manufacturing, outsourcing, real-world evidence, 
compounding, generics, and rare diseases.
                       reigniting cancer moonshot
  --$50 million to advance the President's Cancer Moonshot goals. This 
        funding will advance the President's Cancer Moonshot.

    Alliance comment: Our nation's investment in prevention, diagnosis, 
treatment, and cure of cancer has produced remarkable advances. FDA 
plays an essential role as the intermediary between research and 
clinical practice. With more funding, FDA will be able to do more to 
improve the outlook for cancer patients and their families.
 strengthening public health and mission support capacity (agency-wide 
                                impact)
  --$10 million in further investments in enterprise data and IT 
        modernization. The budget will expand data exchange 
        capabilities and underlying technology platforms to better meet 
        the challenges of the FDA's programs and mission-critical 
        responsibilities.

  --$16 million for regulatory and mission support functions within the 
        Office of the Commissioner. These resources will enable the FDA 
        to provide the appropriate crosscutting strategic direction, 
        policy coordination, and business services to ensure that the 
        FDA's programs operate effectively, efficiently, and are well 
        coordinated.

  --$9.4 million for FDA buildings, facilities, and infrastructure 
        improvements. The budget includes additional funding to help 
        ensure that the FDA's offices and laboratories across the 
        country are secure, modern, reliable, and cost-effective.

  --$105.3 million for cost-of-living salary increases for fiscal Year 
        23 and fiscal Year 24.

    Alliance comment: Science-based decision making requires 
infrastructure, integrated databases, and program coordination. 
Investments in these areas have not kept pace with the agency's needs. 
We earlier commented on the challenges of recruiting and maintaining a 
scientific workforce. Paying for the salary increases outright, rather 
than subtracting them from existing programs, is an important budgeting 
advance.
                               conclusion
    We urge Congress to recognize the multiple opportunities for FDA to 
be a more effective protector of public health, as well as a fair and 
efficient regulator. Additional investment in FDA will result in 
substantial added value to the American public.
    The Alliance again thanks the subcommittee for its support of the 
agency and looks forward to working with Members of Congress and staff 
on fiscal Year 24 appropriations for FDA.

Drug Program at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
    My name is Dr. Matthew Rizzo, I am a physician, a researcher, a 
neurologist, and a professor. I am also a husband, son, father, and 
friend. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to submit this testimony 
on an issue of great professional interest and great personal 
importance to me and so many other Americans.
    I currently serve as the Frances & Edgar Reynolds Chair & Professor 
of the Department of Neurological Sciences, Director of Neurosciences 
Services, and Co-Director of the Center for Integrative and 
Translational Neuroscience at the University of Nebraska Medical 
Center, as well as Director of the National Institutes of Health/
National Institute of General Medical Sciences Great Plains IDeA-
Clinical and Translational Research network. I received my medical 
training at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and completed 
my residency in Neurology and fellowship in Behavioral Neurology and 
Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Iowa. Prior to joining the 
University of Nebraska Medical Center, I served as a Professor of 
Neurology at the University of Iowa College of Medicine; Vice Chair of 
Transitional and Clinical Research, Department of Neurology at the 
University of Iowa College of Medicine, and as the Director of the 
Aging Brain and Mind Initiative at the University of Iowa. They do 
research and provide care for patients with memory disorders, 
particularly focusing on addressing behavioral consequences of aging 
and neurological disorders.
    I am also honored to serve as the Chair of the American Brain 
Coalition (ABC). The ABC is a nonprofit organization comprised of 
nearly 150 of the Nation's leading professional neurological, 
psychological, and psychiatric associations and patient organizations. 
Together, the ABC seeks to advance the understanding the brain and 
reduce the burden of brain disorders for the millions of Americans who 
suffer from diseases affecting the brain and central nervous system 
(CNS).
    We are grateful that Congress first funded the Neurology Drug 
Program in fiscal Year 2023. This initial funding will allow FDA to 
gain the expertise to develop policies and guidance that keep pace with 
emerging brain science. We look forward to the resulting advances from 
the Neurology Drug Program that encompass all areas of brain health 
including neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, brain 
injuries and more.
    Brain diseases, including neurological, psychiatric, and CNS 
disorders, impose staggering personal and financial costs on Americans. 
Nearly one in five U.S. adults live with a mental illness. 
Neuropsychiatric disorders are also the leading cause of disability in 
the Nation, making up 18.7 percent of years lost to disability and 
premature death.\1\ Neurological conditions are troublingly prevalent 
as well--twenty million Americans suffer from a neurological condition, 
with 16 percent of households including an individual with a brain 
impairment.\2\ Brain and CNS diseases also harm older Americans, with 
more than one in nine people over age 65 having Alzheimer's 
dementia.\3\

    The enormous personal costs of brain and CNS conditions also 
translate to financial hardship for patients and their families and 
burden the U.S. economy. Brain disorders and diseases cost the U.S. 
more than $1.5 trillion per year,\4\ a significant portion of which is 
borne by the Medicare program. Seven of the twenty-one chronic 
conditions tracked by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are 
related to the brain, representing an average annual cost of $23,325 
per Medicare beneficiary--higher than the average cost for all other 
chronic conditions.\5\

    The high prevalence of these diseases means that nearly every 
family in the U.S. has either personally experienced a brain disease or 
watched a loved one struggle with the effects of diseases like 
substance use disorder, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's 
disease, and hundreds of other diseases that impact the brain.
    Despite the prevalence and impact of these diseases, few effective 
treatments are available for many brain diseases and disorders. While 
product development is difficult for any condition, treatment 
development for brain disease is uniquely challenging. In particular:

  --Clinical trials for brain and CNS conditions fail more often and 
        are frequently more costly than clinical trials for other 
        conditions.\6\

    These delays compound the fact that not enough treatments exist--
every extra expense and every delay means more time that our families, 
friends, and neighbors suffer from the frequently debilitating effects 
of these diseases.
    The lack of safe and effective treatments for brain disease is 
particularly frustrating given the incredible neuroscience discoveries 
made in the past decade. In addition to private investment, robust 
public investment in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the 
BRAIN Initiative, we are building the knowledge base that will allow us 
to finally deliver treatments to patients that need them.
    Ambitious engineers hope to extract human consciousness and put it 
in artificial processors able to hold the experience and unique 
processing capacity that form our individuality. The sheer number of 
brain cells (about 200 million, half of them neurons) and connections 
(up to 10,000 per neuron), and ignorance of relevant systems science 
and minimal requirements to generate any kind of consciousness, put 
this dream out of reach so far.\9\ Others hope to understand the 
restorative capacity of the brain and the potential to regenerate, 
replace and integrate elements as they die, or to delay the demise of 
neurons so that they last as long as our bodies last. These approaches 
include attempts to delay mental decline before it becomes clinically 
significant through increased mental and physical activity and caloric 
restriction.

    For example, ongoing work aims to discern and delay different 
phases of Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with declines in 
vasculature, lipid metabolism, and neurotransmitters. Phases of decline 
preceding cell death in AD and related disorders are biochemical, 
cellular, and clinical, and may antedate diagnosis by decades. The 
biochemical phase begins decades before the cellular phase, which in 
turn begins years before clinical diagnosis. AD builds up slowly, long 
before it becomes clinically apparent and does not simply ``happen'' 
all at once, later in life. Understanding these early phases of a 
disease that devaStates so many older Americans is critical. Early 
diagnosis could allow early intervention to halt disease progression in 
its tracks, before it is too late to matter.
    To respond to the unique challenges in the discovery and 
development of treatments for brain disease, and allow more 
neuroscience discoveries to directly benefit patients, it is vital that 
the Federal Government prepare the brain-specific regulatory tools and 
guidelines needed for fast, well-structured, transparent, and 
predictable product review. To support this aim, ABC and the brain 
community are advocating for Congress to increase funding for the 
Neurology Drug Program at the FDA. This program would allow FDA to 
develop policies and guidance that keep pace with emerging brain 
science. By appropriating the necessary resources dedicated to meet the 
challenges I have outlined, FDA will be positioned to issue guidance 
and eventually bring safe and effective brain-targeting treatments to 
market.
    A problem like brain disease requires a focused, urgent response 
that takes seriously the incredible burden borne by patients who often 
face poor prognoses and have access to too few treatments. Every day 
that a safe and effective treatment for a brain disease or disorder is 
delayed unnecessarily is another day that millions of patients suffer 
from potentially debilitating diseases. ABC urges the subcommittee to 
provide $3 million in fiscal Year 2024 to for the Neurology Drug 
Program to provide better guidance to researchers and product 
developers for detection and treatment of neurological disorders.
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide this testimony. The ABC 
looks forward to continuing this dialogue and identifying creative 
solutions to bring more treatments and cures to patients with 
neurological and psychiatric disease.

                                 ______
                                 
   Prepared Statement of American Commodity Distribution Association
    On behalf of the American Commodity Distribution Association 
(ACDA), I respectfully submit this statement regarding the FY 2024 
budget request of the Food and Nutrition Service for inclusion in the 
Subcommittee's official record. ACDA members appreciate the 
Subcommittee's support for these vital programs.
    ACDA members involved in school food programs and household 
programs continue to do all that they can to provide USDA Foods in a 
variety of settings. We have dealt with supply chain challenges, 
different demands across different programs, and concerns about the 
potential for increased needs particularly in household programs in the 
coming year.
    We continue to thank our partners at the Agricultural Marketing 
Service and the Food and Nutrition Service who have responded using the 
authorities available to them. We also continue to maintain the 
specific concerns we have regarding donated food support for both 
schools and food banks. While efforts are being made to return to 
``normal'', it is a transition. Food prices have not returned to 
``normal'', and are a significant problem. We continue to ask that you 
fully fund administrative expense funding for TEFAP at $100 million; 
provide the requested $390,000,000 for the Commodity Supplemental Food 
Program (CSFP) to maintain the current caseload and to allow for 
requested expansion; and to increase funding for the school food 
equipment grant program.
    ACDA is a non-profit professional trade association, dedicated 
since 1974 to the growth and improvement of USDA's Commodity Food 
Distribution Program. ACDA members include state agencies that 
distribute USDA-purchased foods; agricultural organizations; industry; 
associate members; recipient agencies, such as schools and soup 
kitchens; and allied organizations, such as anti-hunger groups. ACDA 
members this past year distributed more than 3 billion pounds of 
domestically produced commodities this past year to programs including 
the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, the Emergency Food 
Assistance Program, the Summer Food Service Program, the Commodity 
Supplemental Food Program, and the Child and Adult Care Food Program.
                       usda foods face challenges
    ACDA supports the budget request of $468,752,000 for the purchase 
of TEFAP commodities and supports the Secretary's ability to procure 
additional foods as needed using the authority of the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (CCC). The $517,000,000 in FY 2022 bonus commodities was 
very helpful in meeting the needs faced by food banks, and we urge the 
Subcommittee to monitor available food supplies to recognize that both 
bonuses and supplemental funding may be needed to meet needs. We are 
anticipating a higher demand on food banks with the loss of higher SNAP 
benefits.
    As we have done previously, we highlight section 4205 of the 
Agricultural Act of 2014 which established a multiagency task force to 
evaluate and monitor the commodity programs to ensure that they meet 
the mission of the Department. There has not been such a report in the 
past year, so we urge the Subcommittee to direct the prompt provision 
of such a report, and to include both food vendors and recipient 
agencies to secure their views.
    We also ask the Subcommittee to solicit a study on the impact of 
fees on USDA Foods utilization in the National School Lunch Program. We 
also urge the Subcommittee call for a study on the challenges faced by 
rural and remote schools face including the absence of distributors, 
the complexity of deliveries, and their smaller scale.
                   nutrition standards going forward
    In February FNS published its proposed rule establishing school 
meal nutrition standards for SY 2024-2025 and beyond. The public 
comment period is open through April 10, and ACDA has urged the 
Secretary to extend the comment period given the significance of this 
proposed rule. ACDA will submit comments reflecting our members' views, 
and will continue to work on this issue.
    As we said last year, ACDA supports responsible meal standards that 
provide quality meals to students. Any such rule should meet standards 
of affordability, availability, acceptability, and administrative 
achievability. The ability to offer a quality school meal program is 
directly linked to the ability to pay the costs associated with the 
program's operation. Any more stringent nutrition standard needs to be 
both realistic and phased in over time. The Department should keep in 
mind the challenges that manufacturers face in developing new products, 
the costs associated with a schedule of revising products to meet 
standards, and the challenges that school food authorities face in 
providing nutritious meals that are desired by students. It is 
important that the dialogue encouraged by comments on the rule proceed 
so that meaningful and measured action can be achieved.
         fully fund tefap administrative funds at $100 million
    ACDA strongly supports the President's proposal to fully fund TEFAP 
Administrative Funds at $100 million. ACDA has consistently urged full 
funding and appreciates the level of support provided by the 
Subcommittee in the past. Food banks are making every effort to control 
costs, but operating expenses are increasing further demonstrating the 
justification for full funding.
    As we have told the Subcommittee in the past, food banks, Community 
Action Agencies, and other TEFAP operators continue to find that they 
have had little choice but to convert food dollars to administrative 
expense funds to maintain their operations. Using food dollars, 
particularly when programs face higher food costs, for operating 
expenses reduces the ability of these operators to provide food 
assistance to more individuals and families who continue to face 
difficult times.
                      school food equipment grants
    ACDA supports increasing School Food Equipment Grants to $35 
million, an increase of $5 million over the budget request, and opposes 
the proposal to decrease School Breakfast Equipment Grants by 
$3,000,000. The ability to provide quality meals is directly linked to 
school food equipment. Many more school food authorities need this type 
of assistance, meriting expanding these programs and not reducing them.
    ACDA continues to support emphasizing the importance of fruits and 
vegetables in all forms--fresh, canned, dried, and frozen--as noted in 
the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. However, we remain 
concerned about mandating not just what children are offered in school 
meals but what they must take, whether they intend to eat it or not. 
Increasing flexibility to program sponsors in planning menus that meet 
high nutrition standards but still are within cost targets is of 
critical importance and will help reduce waste resulting from this 
mandate.
                              buy american
    ACDA appreciates the efforts of America's farmers and ranchers to 
provide wholesome product for various feeding programs, in addition to 
the important role they make in supporting American consumers. 
Producers continue to see product coming into the United States that 
disrupt domestic sales and result in the need for Bonus Buys. Buy 
American provisions are included in the proposed school meals standard 
rule. ACDA continues to stand by the recommendations we made last year. 
First, ACDA urges FNS to work to reduce the administrative burden of 
repetitive exemption forms. State agencies need better guidance to 
permit longer-term exemptions when supply issues are well known. 
Second, help clarify what products should/should not be sold to School 
Food Authorities (SFAs) while supporting domestic suppliers that 
provide our most essential needs. Third, exemptions of commodity 
reprocessed products sold in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) 
and School Breakfast Program (SBP) would benefit both processors and 
Recipient Agencies by reducing audit paperwork while supporting 
domestic farmers and industry stakeholders. Fourth, FNS should provide 
guidance and best practices to vendors/distributors, particularly 
national and multi-state operations, as to how to identify the point of 
origin on products being offered for sale. Fifth, several SFAs have 
limited options when it comes to vendors who are willing to supply 
their programs. FNS should consider some type of incentive program for 
vendors to provide supplies to limited-service areas which could 
provide additional competition that would help both with price and 
product availability.
    ACDA thanks the Subcommittee for its support over the years and 
looks forward to continuing to work with you as the FY 2024 
Appropriation moves ahead.

         Prepared Statement of American Farm Bureau Federation
    Chairman Heinrich, Ranking Member Hoeven and members of the 
Committee:
    On behalf of the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), the 
Nation's largest general farm organization, I commend the committee's 
steadfast support of agriculture, our Nation's food supply, and the 
well-being of rural America. The funding priorities for our 
organization are outlined below.
    AFBF supports increasing spending levels above FY23 enacted levels 
for the following programs:
    Agricultural Research: USDA's Agricultural Research Service, 
National Institute of Food and Agriculture, including the Agriculture 
and Food Research Initiative, Economic Research Service, and National 
Agricultural Statistics Service which provide research, data, and 
statistical analysis critical for addressing challenges faced by the 
agriculture community.
    Crop Protection: Office of Pesticide Management Policy, which 
promotes the development of new pest management approaches and is 
critical for crop protection. USDA's Minor Crop Pest Management Program 
(IR-4) ensures safe and effective agrichemicals and biopesticides are 
available for small, specialty crop markets.
    Farm Programs: AFBF urges the committee to protect programs that 
ensure U.S. farmers and ranchers are able to continue to produce food, 
fiber and fuel as they battle high input prices, labor challenges, and 
natural disasters. AFBF supports increased funding for risk management 
tools, which include Federal crop insurance and commodity programs, as 
well as Federal conservation programs, which preserve environmental 
benefits. AFBF supports prioritizing working lands conservation 
programs over retirement land programs. Additionally, increased funding 
for the Farm Service Agency (FSA) loan guarantee programs will ensure 
availability to farmers eligible under current authorities and the FSA 
Agricultural Mediation Program.

    In addition, adequate funding should be provided for personnel and 
technology upgrades to effectively serve farmers and ranchers utilizing 
these programs.
    Food Safety: Increase funding for food protection at the Food and 
Drug Administration and Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) 
directed to increase education and training of inspectors and other 
relevant staff.
    International Programs: The Market Access Program and the Foreign 
Market Development Program to increase demand for U.S. agriculture and 
food products in foreign markets. The McGovern-Dole International Food 
for Education and Child Nutrition Program, which effectively delivers 
both food aid and educational assistance. Public Law 480 programs, 
which provide foreign food aid by purchasing U.S. commodities.
    AFBF supports funding the following programs at the authorized 
spending level:

                                 ______
                                 
        Prepared Statement of American Society for Microbiology
    The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) appreciates the 
opportunity to submit outside witness testimony for the Fiscal Year 
2024 Agriculture appropriations bill in support of increased funding 
for the Research, Education, and Economics research area.
    ASM respectfully requests that Congress provide $4 billion for 
research, education, and outreach at the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
in Fiscal Year 2024. Specifically, we recommend

  --$700 million for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative 
        (AFRI),

  --$1.9 billion for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS)

  --$112 million for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF),

  --$100 million for the Advanced Agriculture Research and Development 
        Authority (AgARDA), and

  --an increase of $85 million for antimicrobial resistance priorities 
        at USDA.

  --$2.2 billion for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
        (APHIS)

    ASM is one of the oldest and largest life science societies with 
30,000 members in the U.S. and around the world. Our mission is to 
promote and advance the microbial sciences, including programs and 
initiatives funded by Federal Government departments and agencies, by 
virtue of the integral role microorganisms play in human health and 
society. Microbial science is a cross-cutting endeavor, and our 
members' federally funded research is fundamental to advances in human 
health, agriculture, energy, and the environment.
        a strong investment in microbial research pays dividends
    We thank Congress for its bipartisan support of agriculture 
research and for its commitment to foundational microbiology research 
at USDA. For every dollar invested in agriculture research, there is a 
return on investment of $17. At one point in time, agriculture research 
represented 4.3 percent of the overall non-defense research allocations 
and appropriations for the Federal Government. Today, it is nearly half 
that amount, which is concerning, considering Agricultural research is 
the underpinning of all Titles within the Farm Bill.
    ASM appreciates USDA's commitment to environmentally sound and 
economically viable agricultural practices. As noted in the National 
Academies report Science Breakthroughs to Advance Food and Agricultural 
Research by 2030, further understanding of animal, soil, and plant 
microbiomes will provide opportunities to improve crop production, 
transform feed efficiency, and increase resilience to stress and 
disease. To support these innovative technologies and practices, USDA 
must increase investments in the microbial sciences.
    Thanks to past investments in microbiology research through AFRI, 
scientists are:

  --Developing a voluntary framework for antimicrobial stewardship in 
        animals. This addresses a critical need, as widespread use of 
        antibiotics in animals and humans has led to increased 
        resistance and could render these medicines ineffective.

  --Learning more about how soil and root microbiome can be altered to 
        improve plant productivity and soil health. This knowledge will 
        help ensure crop viability over the longer term.

  --Studying the connection of the soil microbiome to human gut health 
        and related outcomes. This promising area of research will 
        become increasingly important as climate change alters crop 
        production and food availability.

  --Learning more about the role that the bovine gut microbiome plays 
        in how cattle process feed. By deepening our understanding of 
        this complex ecosystem, scientists hope that better strategies 
        for sustainable beef production can be developed.
usda-funded research is needed to address climate change, antimicrobial 
                     resistance, and food security
    The challenges facing our Nation's producers and consumers are 
growing. World food demand is expected to double in the next 25 years, 
increasing the stress on the U.S. food and agricultural enterprise. In 
addition, we continue to face a rapidly changing climate and 
antimicrobial resistance (AMR), while recovering from the ongoing 
pandemic and preparing for the next one. AMR is one of the most 
daunting public health challenges facing the U.S. and the world. ASM 
and its members are tackling AMR from a variety of angles-from health 
care and clinical laboratory settings to agricultural and environmental 
microbial research perspectives, in the U.S. and around the world. A 
problem as complex as AMR requires multi-faceted approaches consistent 
with the One Health model, recognizing that the health of people, 
animals, and the environment are interdependent. Likewise, policy 
solutions must be comprehensive and address AMR from multiple angles 
and, when possible, with integrated strategies.
    To combat AMR, we recommend an increase of at least $85 million for 
antimicrobial resistance priorities at USDA, including a $25 million 
increase in funding for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) and the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN). This 
funding allows the agency to continue to promote agricultural 
stewardship, including gathering and evaluating valuable information on 
antibiotic use practices and identifying and characterizing injudicious 
use on farms and other agricultural settings through the National 
Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) and other initiatives.
    Tackling AMR will require increased investment in basic and applied 
research into why microbes become resistant, how they persist in 
ecological niches, and to develop novel countermeasures, including 
continued support for Invasive Pest Emergencies and the National Animal 
and Disease Preparedness and Response programs. This work also will 
entail public-private partnerships through entities such as the 
Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health and ideally its USDA 
equivalent, AGARDA. Other policy approaches that are critical to 
success include those that bolster AMR surveillance and laboratory 
capacity, support programs dedicated to infection prevention and 
control in healthcare and non-healthcare settings, policies to promote 
access to AMR tools in low and middle resource countries that improve 
diagnostics, microbiome modulators and antibiotic stewardship, and 
broader application and integration of pathogen genomic sequencing 
technologies.
    Expanded funding for agricultural research including the National 
Bio and Agro-Defense Facility through ARS will enable USDA 
investigators and scientists to better protect the Nation's 
agriculture, farmers and citizens against the threat and potential 
impact of serious animal diseases and to understand the factors driving 
the emergence of resistant pathogens, which are expected to become even 
more common due to climate change. If we are to seize the current, 
unparalleled scientific opportunities that exist in microbial research, 
Congress must also support the deployment and use of technology and 
practices to enhance microbial research data collection and utilization 
to make our food and agricultural systems more efficient, resilient, 
and sustainable.
    As in human health, applications of the microbiome in animal health 
are expanding rapidly, with exciting prospects for application in 
domestic pets, farm animals, and conservation. Food production depends 
on healthy microbiomes, and microbiome innovation can support the 
agricultural sector as it works to meet the needs of a growing 
population. To date, many studies have identified associations between 
the microbiome, productivity, and management practices in various food 
animal species; however, the specific organisms and metabolic pathways 
involved remain to be determined. A coordinated effort to do so in the 
main food producing animals could propel the industry to the next level 
and support the pressing concerns of feeding the planet and combating 
antimicrobial resistance.
    Our nation's ability to meet the 21st century challenges of human 
nutrition and food security, conservation of our Nation's resources, 
and antimicrobial resistance will only be possible if Congress 
continues its commitment to robust and sustained funding increases for 
microbial, food, and agricultural research through AFRI, AgARDA, and 
other USDA-funded research, education, and extension programs. ASM 
recognizes the challenges facing our Nation and the difficult decisions 
that must be made to ensure our Nation's fiscal health, and we believe 
that funding cutting edge agricultural research will help our Nation's 
farmers and ranchers succeed in the 21st century. Targeted acceleration 
of innovative research through funding AgARDA, combined with meaningful 
increases for USDA-funded research and FDA budget authority in fiscal 
Year 2024 are essential for supporting microbial research to benefit 
animal, human, and environmental health.

          Prepared Statement of American Society for Nutrition
    The American Society for Nutrition (ASN) respectfully requests that 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)/National Institute of Food 
and Agriculture/Agriculture and Food Research Initiative receive $550 
million, and that the USDA/Agricultural Research Service receive $1.95 
billion in fiscal year 2024. ASN has more than 8,000 members working 
throughout academia, clinical practice, government, and industry, who 
conduct research to advance our knowledge and application of nutrition.
                agriculture and food research initiative
    The USDA has been the lead nutrition agency and the most important 
Federal agency to influence U.S. policies on dietary intake and food 
patterns for years. Agricultural research is essential to address the 
ever-increasing demand for a healthy, affordable, nutritious and 
sustainable food supply. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative 
(AFRI) competitive grants program is charged with funding fundamental 
and applied research, extension, and education in support of our 
Nation's interconnected food and agricultural systems, which includes 
human nutrition. AFRI has funded cutting-edge, nutrition research on 
key issues of timely importance on a competitive, peer-reviewed basis 
since its establishment in the 2008 Farm Bill.
    ASN requests that AFRI be funded at $550 million in fiscal Year 
2024, the same amount requested in the President's budget proposal. 
$550 million would allow AFRI to support more competitive grants that 
ensure a safe, sustainable, nutritious, affordable, adequate food 
supply and bring AFRI closer to its fully authorized funding level of 
$700 million/year. This funding level for AFRI is needed to invest in 
crucial areas aimed at addressing our Nation's most urgent and pressing 
food, agriculture, and public health challenges. AFRI-funded research 
supports nutrition and wellness, equity across the food system, food 
safety and traceability, supply chain resiliency, and a diverse 
research workforce. Growing inflation and food insecurity have been 
felt throughout the food and agriculture sector. However, AFRI is 
uniquely suited to address many of these challenges through 
transdisciplinary research, which allows researchers across disciplines 
to examine issues in a systematic way rather than in silos. For 
example, a total of $20 million is included in the AFRI budget proposal 
to support the Cancer Moonshot efforts with funding for the Precision 
Nutrition program at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). However, 
despite incremental increases in AFRI funding, roughly 70 percent of 
AFRI proposals that are deemed worthy by expert review panels are not 
funded, simply because of insufficient funding. Agricultural and food 
research funding at the USDA has unfortunately remained fairly flat 
over the last fifty years.
    Funding AFRI at $550 million in fiscal Year 2024 is critical to 
provide a safe and nutritious food supply for the world's population, 
to preserve the competitive position of U.S. agriculture in the global 
marketplace, and to provide jobs and revenue crucial to support the 
U.S. economy. Robust investment in USDA-supported research is also 
needed to attract, retain, and develop the next generation of 
scientists from diverse backgrounds to advance innovations benefiting 
all Americans. In order to achieve those benefits, AFRI must be able to 
support agricultural research and coordinate opportunities to build off 
of these discoveries.
                     agricultural research service
    The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) ensures high-quality, safe 
food and other agricultural products; assesses the nutritional needs of 
Americans; sustains a competitive agricultural economy; enhances the 
natural resource base and the environment; and provides economic 
opportunities for rural citizens, communities, and society as a whole. 
ARS supports intramural and extramural research across four national 
program areas including Nutrition, Food Safety and Quality. The ARS 
Nutrition, Food Safety, and Quality National Program maintains a 
healthy and safe food supply while improving the economic viability and 
competitiveness of American agriculture. ASN requests that ARS receive 
$1.95 billion in fiscal Year 2024 to ensure that ARS can respond to 
food safety and nutrition security concerns, new plant and animal pests 
and diseases, and weather-related and environmental stresses.
    ARS's human nutrition research program includes six Human Nutrition 
Research Centers (HNRCs) across the Nation that link producer and 
consumer interests and form the core for building knowledge about food 
and nutrition. HNRCs conduct unparalleled human nutrition research on 
the role of food and dietary components in human health from conception 
to advanced old age, and they provide authoritative, peer-reviewed, 
science-based evidence that forms the basis of our Federal nutrition 
policy and programs. HNRCs play an important role not only in 
generating knowledge, but also in translating it for stakeholders. 
Funding for ARS supports all of the USDA/HNRCs and ensures that these 
research facilities have adequate funding to continue their unique 
mission of improving the health of Americans through cutting-edge food, 
nutrition and agricultural research. The President's budget request 
seeks $1.979 billion for ARS and includes $41 to improve ARS buildings 
and facilities.
    Nutrition monitoring conducted by the USDA/ARS in partnership with 
the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is a unique and 
critically important surveillance function in which dietary intake, 
nutritional status, and health status are evaluated in a rigorous and 
standardized manner. ARS is responsible for food and nutrient databases 
and the ``What We Eat in America'' dietary survey, while HHS tracks 
nutritional status and health parameters. Nutrition monitoring findings 
are essential for multiple government agencies, as well as the public 
and private sector to track what Americans are eating, inform nutrition 
and dietary guidance policy, evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency 
of nutrition assistance programs, and study nutrition-related disease 
outcomes. Because of past funding deficiencies, some food composition 
database entries do not reflect the realities of the current food 
supply, which may negatively impact programs and policies based on this 
information. It is imperative that ARS continue to receive increased 
support to update food and nutrient databases and to continue critical 
surveillance of the Nation's nutritional status and the many benefits 
it provides.
    Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony regarding fiscal 
Year 2024 appropriations for the U.S. Department of Agriculture/
National Institute of Food and Agriculture/AFRI competitive grants 
program and Agricultural Research Service. Please contact John E. 
Courtney, Ph.D., Executive Officer, at jcourtney@nutrition.org or 240-

                                 ______
                                 
   Prepared Statement of the American Society for the Prevention of 
                       Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)
    On behalf of The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals (ASPCA), the first humane organization in North America, and 
our over 2 million supporters nationwide, thank you for the opportunity 
to submit written testimony to the subcommittee. We ask that you please 
consider the following provisions to benefit animal welfare as you 
draft the FY2024 Agriculture Appropriations bill.
        require aphis to properly enforce the animal welfare act
    The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) 
continues to fail to enforce the Animal Welfare Act, despite having 
adequate resources to do so. Rather than request additional funds for 
the program to address problematic licensees and stop systemic animal 
cruelty, the agency has proposed a decrease of $1.865 million and 32 
FTEs for the program in FY2024. We are grateful that the enacted 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (Public Law 117-328) included 
bill language preventing the use of funds for the non-recording of 
observed violations of the AWA on inspection reports, finally ending 
the agency's misguided ``Teachable Moments'' program, which allowed 
non-compliant facilities to avoid having their violations recorded. The 
House Agriculture Appropriations Report, which was incorporated into 
the Joint Explanatory Statement by reference, also included a strong 
directive to the agency to reform its licensing, inspection, and 
enforcement scheme. However, despite this language, the agency 
continues to fail to respond to violations of the law with appropriate 
action, even in the worst cases. In early March 2023, Reuters published 
a story revealing that high-ranking APHIS officials went to great 
lengths to cover up ongoing AWA violations and animal suffering at the 
beagle breeding and testing facility operated by Envigo in Cumberland, 
Virginia-thwarting efforts by inspectors to intervene and alleviate the 
suffering of thousands of dogs. The article includes details about 
agency officials directing inspectors to delete content from their 
reports, denying support for inspections to build a case against this 
non-compliant licensee, and removing the team leader supervising the 
investigation without explanation. This disturbing series of events 
expose an agency that is more concerned about protecting licensed 
businesses from repercussions than protecting animals. The ASPCA 
requests that the subcommittee include the following bill language: 
``Sec. X: None of the funds made available by this act or any other act 
may be used to: (a) issue or renew the license of any licensed dealer 
or exhibitor where agency personnel have previously recorded or 
observed any violation of the Animal Welfare Act or its regulations, 
other than administrative or record-keeping violations on inspection 
reports; (b) conduct announced inspections (other than pre-license 
inspections) or any announced ``courtesy'' or ``compliance'' visit; (c) 
conduct any inspection of any dealer or exhibitor's facility without 
the use of a body camera for all agency personnel present at the 
inspection. The Secretary shall ensure that each inspection report and 
all supporting records, including photographs and video recordings, 
reflecting any violation of the law or regulations, other than 
administrative or record keeping violations, are shared immediately, 
and no later 24 hours after inspection, with State and local law 
enforcement authorities of appropriate jurisdiction; (d) conduct more 
than one pre-license inspection.'' Additionally, we request an increase 
of $4,000,000 above the President's FY24 request for the Animal Welfare 
program to ensure the proper enforcement of Federal standards, as well 
as to cover the initial costs of body cameras for inspectors and the 
necessary software to enable APHIS to share photographs and videos with 
State and local law enforcement as necessary to assist with animal 
cruelty investigations.
 continue the current ban on federal funding for horse slaughterhouse 
                              inspections
    The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 continues the 
longstanding provision barring Federal funding for Food Safety and 
Inspection Service (FSIS) inspections at domestic horse 
slaughterhouses. Americans do not consume horse meat, we do not raise 
horses for food, and national polling from 2021 \1\ indicates that 83 
percent of American voters oppose the slaughter of horses for human 
consumption. Cruelties associated with all stages of horse slaughter 
are well-documented. Horses are at risk of suffering for prolonged 
periods during transport to slaughter. Before this funding restriction 
was in place, horses slaughtered in FSIS regulated plants endured 
repeated blows, sometimes remaining conscious during dismemberment, 
because the equipment used to slaughter horses is not designed for 
their physiology.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition to these intrinsic welfare concerns, consumption of 
meat from American horses is a public safety gamble. A 2010 Food and 
Chemical Toxicology Journal article detailed the ubiquitous use of 
phenylbutazone in racehorses subsequently sent to auction and then to 
slaughter only days after medication.\2\ Phenylbutazone is one of the 
anti-inflammatory drugs most frequently administered to horses in the 
United States regardless of discipline, and its use is prohibited for 
animals raised for human consumption. Taxpayer dollars should not be 
used to prop up an industry that disregards animal welfare and human 
health. President Biden's FY24 Budget Proposal includes this 
longstanding provision blocking Federal funding for horse 
slaughterhouse inspections. The ASPCA requests that the subcommittee 
continue the prohibition on Federal funding for domestic horse 
slaughter by including the following bill language: ``None of the funds 
made available by this or any other act in this or any fiscal year 
hereafter may be used to pay the salaries or expenses of personnel- (1) 
to inspect horses under section 3 of the Federal Meat Inspection Act 
(21 U.S.C. 603); (2) to inspect horses under section 903 of the Federal 
Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 1901 note; 
Public Law 104-127); or (3) to implement or enforce section 352.19 of 
title 9, Code of Federal Regulations (or a successor regulation).''

    direct usda to report on costs and risks of animal depopulation
    Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) operate using a 
``just in time'' model, meaning that CAFOs run according to a strict 
timeline of animal rearing tied to specific slaughter dates at 
predetermined slaughter facilities. Once one herd or flock is 
transported off-site for slaughter, there is just enough time to prep 
for the arrival of the next batch of animals. When an emergency occurs 
and access to slaughter is reduced or eliminated, CAFOs are ill-
equipped to adjust and care for ``excess'' animals who can quickly 
accumulate on farms. Without the space or resources to care for those 
animals, they resort to ``intentional depopulation,'' which requires 
killing entire flocks or herds of animals through various methods, 
rather than through the regular slaughter process or humane euthanasia. 
Some of the methods used to kill ``excess'' animals, like ventilation 
shutdown, are particularly inhumane. To kill chickens and pigs using 
ventilation shutdown, workers are forced to shut off barns' ventilation 
systems--and often raise the heat--with animals sealed inside, where 
they slowly die from overheating and suffocation. At this time, there 
are no reporting requirements on the methods used to depopulate farm 
animals. The ASPCA requests that the subcommittee include the following 
bill language requesting a report on the current and future costs to 
taxpayers and risks to national security, animals, rural communities, 
and consumers associated with the mass depopulation of livestock and 
poultry in CAFOs: ``Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment 
of this act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall submit to the Committee 
on Appropriations in both Houses of Congress a report detailing the 
future costs to taxpayers and the risks to national security, animals, 
rural communities, and consumers associated with the depopulation of 
livestock and poultry in concentrated animal feeding operations, as 
defined by 40 CFR 122.23.'' Additionally, we request the following 
report language: ``The Committee understands that, in response to the 
COVID pandemic, poultry and livestock producers that operate 
concentrated animal feeding operations engaged in large scale 
depopulation practices that included inhumane methods such as 
ventilation shutdowns and water-based foam, and received USDA COVID-19 
relief funds, resources, and other forms of support to accomplish this 
depopulation. The Committee must fully understand the impact these 
depopulation practices have on animals, consumers, taxpayers, and the 
communities where these concentrated animal feeding operations exist.''
     direct the gao to submit a report evaluating the 28-hour rule
    The regular feeding, watering, and rest required for animals under 
49 USC Sec. 80502 by animal carriers is not being effectively enforced 
or may be waived by USDA inspectors; lack of enforcement or wavier of 
the 28-hour rule causes undue stress on the animals being transported 
and is counter to the intent of underlying statute. To acquire more 
information about how the USDA is enforcing the 28-hour rule, the ASPCA 
requests the following bill language: ``(a) Not later than 365 days 
after the date of enactment of this act, the Government Accountability 
Office (GAO) shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House 
of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and 
Forestry of the Senate a report evaluating the 28-hour rule, as defined 
in 49 USC Sec. 80502, prohibiting the confinement of animals in a 
vehicle or vessel for more than 28 consecutive hours without unloading 
the animals for feeding, water, and rest. (b) The report shall 
include--(1) An examination of the enforcement and waivers of the 28-
hour rule; and (2) An evaluation of- (a) The monitoring systems in 
place for enforcement; (b) The number of waivers issued on a yearly 
basis; (c) An evaluation of the roles of the Department of Agriculture, 
Department of Transportation, and the Department of Justice in 
enforcing the statute; (d) An evaluation of the funding of the agencies 
authorized to enforce the statute; (e)Any concerns or problems with the 
implementation of the statute; and (f) Any positive or negative impact 
on the welfare of animals in transport related to the enforcement, or 
lack thereof, and waiver process. (c) Reporting--Not later than 60 days 
after the release of the GAO report, the Secretary of Agriculture, the 
Secretary of Transportation and the Attorney General shall brief the 
committees on a plan to address issues raised by the report issued 
under this section.'' Additionally, we request the following report 
language: ``The Committee is concerned that the regular feeding, 
watering, and rest required under 49 USC Sec. 80502 by animal carriers 
is not being effectively enforced or may be waived by USDA inspectors; 
lack of enforcement or wavier of the 28-hour rule causes undue stress 
on the animals being transported and is counter to the intent of 
underlying statute. The Committee recognizes that millions of animals 
that are regulated by this statute are transported every year, but the 
lack of coordination by government agencies may be leading to the lack 
of enforcement. The Committee is concerned that lack of enforcement and 
waiving is due to inadequate monitoring systems and enforcement 
authority for the three agencies involved in enforcement: the USDA, 
DOJ, and DOT. The Committee directs the Secretary of Agriculture, 
Secretary of Transportation, and the Attorney General to provide a 
briefing to the Committee on a plan to address issues raised within 60 
days of the release of the GAO report.''
    require fsis to strengthen enforcement of the humane methods of 
                             slaughter act
    The Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA) is effectively the only 
Federal law protecting farm animals from cruelty. It is vitally 
important for animal welfare and food safety that FSIS enforce this law 
and ensure that slaughterhouses follow related humane slaughter and 
handling regulations. We urge the subcommittee to include the following 
bill language to ensure HMSA enforcement is strengthened: ``No fewer 
than 165 full-time equivalent positions shall be employed during fiscal 
year 2024 for purposes dedicated solely to inspections and enforcement 
related to the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. This number is in 
addition to the Humane Handling Enforcement Coordinator and District 
Veterinary Medical Specialist positions.'' Additionally, we request the 
following report language: ``The Food Safety and Inspection Service 
(FSIS) shall ensure that all inspection personnel conducting humane 
handling verification procedures receive robust initial training and 
periodic refresher training on the FSIS humane handling and slaughter 
regulations and directives. This includes handling of non-ambulatory 
disabled animals, as well as proper use of the Humane Activities 
Tracking System to ensure humane handling of animals as they arrive and 
are offloaded and handled in ante-mortem holding pens, suspect pens, 
chutes, stunning areas, and on the processing line. The Committee 
directs the agency to continue preparation and online publication of 
the Humane Handling Quarterly Reports, to include: (1) the number of 
humane handling verification procedures performed, (2) the number of 
administrative enforcement actions taken, (3) time spent on Humane 
Handling Activities Tracking System activities, and (4) comparisons of 
these measurements by plant size and FSIS district. The Committee 
recognizes that the humane handling of birds at slaughter according to 
Good Commercial Practices reduces the occurrence of adulterated poultry 
products in the marketplace and can improve the treatment of birds at 
slaughter. The Committee awaits the Department's briefing requested in 
the fiscal year 2022 and 2023 reports on documented instances where 
establishments lost control of their processes for handling birds, and 
consequently were not operating in accordance with GCPs. Further, the 
Committee directs the USDA to track the number of inspector hours spent 
on GCP verification activities intended to reduce instances of 
adulteration using its existing Humane Activities Tracking System or 
other appropriate method.''
      allocate funding for the value-added producer grant program
    The USDA's Value-Added Producer Grant (VAPG) program helps farmers 
participate in value-added farming activities to generate new products, 
create and expand marketing opportunities and increase farmer income, 
including those produced using more humane farming methods, such as 
welfare-certified or pasture-raised products. The VAPG program is one 
of the only Federal grant programs available to farmers raising animals 
outside of the conventional confinement model and is a critical 
resource for building a more humane food system. The enacted 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 included $13 million in 
discretionary funding for this program; the ASPCA requests the 
subcommittee to meet or exceed this funding level in the FY2024 bill.
allocate funding for horse soring enforcement & urge usda to issue new 
                           proposed hpa rule
    APHIS is also charged with protecting horses through its 
enforcement of the Horse Protection Act (HPA). We appreciate that 
Congress provided $4.096 million in fiscal year 2023 for USDA to 
strengthen enforcement of the HPA. The ASPCA requests no less than the 
fiscal year 2023 enacted level of $4.096 million in the bill to support 
needed enforcement of the HPA. Additionally, we request the following 
report language: ``The Committee provides $4,096,000 for enforcement of 
the Horse Protection Act of 1970, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1831), and 
reminds the Secretary that Congress granted the agency primary 
responsibility to enforce this law. The Committee urges the Secretary 
to issue the new proposed HPA rule expeditiously, consistent with the 
agency's announced intentions in December 2021, and to finalize and 
publish the new final rule by December 31, 2023. The Committee further 
urges the Secretary to ensure that the new rule includes at a minimum 
all the key elements of the final rule, ``Horse Protection; Licensing 
of Designated Qualified Persons and Other Amendments'' [Docket No. 
APHIS-2011-0009], that was finalized and displayed in advance public 
notice in the Federal Register on January 19, 2017.''
  provide funding for usda to implement the pet and women safety act 
                             grant program
    We appreciate that Congress provided $3 million in fiscal year 2023 
to continue implementing Section 12502 of the 2018 Farm Bill (Public 
Law 115-334), which incorporated the language of the Pet and Women 
Safety (PAWS) Act to authorize a grant program to provide emergency and 
transitional shelter options for domestic violence survivors with 
companion animals. Research shows that abusers often threaten or 
inflict violence on pets to intimidate or exert control over their 
partners and prevent them from leaving. This program will ensure that 
more domestic violence service providers are able to accommodate pets 
or arrange for pet shelter. The ASPCA urges the subcommittee to include 
$3,000,000 in the FY2024 Agriculture Appropriations Bill to continue 
implementing the PAWS grant program as authorized in Section 12502 of 
Public Law 115-334. The ASPCA also requests the subcommittee to include 
the following Report Language: ``The Committee directs the Secretary of 
Agriculture to continue coordinating with the Departments of Justice, 
Housing and Urban Development, and Health and Human Services to 
efficiently implement the grant program for providing emergency and 
transitional shelter options for domestic violence survivors with 
companion animals.''

             Prepared Statement of Animal Health Institute
    On behalf of the Animal Health Institute (AHI), I write today to 
request that you include funding for priorities important to human and 
animal health in the Fiscal Year 2024 Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Food and Drug Administrations and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill. 
Funding of these programs protects animal health and human health by 
providing safe and effective products to prevent and treat disease in 
animals.
    AHI is appreciative to Congress for providing $21.48 million for 
the Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) in last year's spending bill. 
We request Congress maintain this funding level for the Center to 
continue to review and approve veterinary biologics in a timely manner, 
help compensate for the coming wave of retirements by experienced CVB 
staffers and continue to bring current vaccines and new and innovative 
technologies to market.
    We request the user fees established by the Animal Drug User Fee 
Act (ADUFA) of $33.500 million be included in the fiscal Year 2024 
appropriations bill. ADUFA provides a system of performance standards 
and user fees to improve the new animal drug review process at the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Veterinary Medicine 
(CVM). Predictability of the review process has improved as FDA CVM has 
met the agreed-upon performance standards. To maintain this success, we 
request that the fees be integrated into this year's appropriation 
bill. The appropriation is entirely budget neutral as the money will be 
provided by the animal health companies.
    The FDA CVM issued final guidance #256, Compounding Animal Drugs 
from Bulk Drug Substances, in 2022, to provide regulatory certainty 
about animal drug compounding from bulk drug substances. The guidance 
alone will not end current abusive practices that threaten animal 
health unless vigorously enforced. We request Congress provide $2 
million to support the CVM in fully and properly enforcing guidance 
#256 to protect animal health.
    Another area of importance within animal and public health is the 
control of ectoparasites in pets, livestock, and the environment. In 
order to ensure timely approval of new preventative medications for 
controlling fleas, ticks, and other ectoparasites in animals, AHI 
requests the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) pesticide 
registration activities be appropriated $166 million for the fiscal 
Year 2024. This will help ensure that much needed improvements to the 
EPA registration process are possible and the agency can decrease the 
time currently required for review and approval of new products.
    AHI respectfully requests $33 million for the USDA-APHIS Wildlife 
Services National Rabies Management Program (NRMP). The program is 
critical to decreasing the spread of rabies and is protective of human 
and animal health.
    Thank you for your consideration. Please do not hesitate to contact 
me if you have any questions or need additional information.

Sincerely,

             Prepared Statement of Animal Welfare Institute
    The Animal Welfare Institute, a nonprofit national animal welfare 
advocacy organization, thanks the subcommittee for its ongoing and 
robust efforts to ensure strong enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act 
and to provide resources to assist domestic violence survivors and 
their pets. We respectfully ask the subcommittee to maintain these 
efforts in FY24 as its leadership and oversight continue to be urgently 
needed.
    Meaningful animal welfare laws are essential both for humane and 
human reasons. These laws-and the steps Congress takes to improve their 
enforcement-decrease the sale of sick pets by commercial breeders, 
improve the integrity of animal-based research, reduce risks of disease 
transmission and dangerous encounters involving animals and the public, 
protect pet owners from the theft of their companion animals by 
unscrupulous dealers, assure food safety for consumers, and improve 
slaughterhouse conditions for both workers and animals. Most 
importantly, they are intended to assure humane treatment of animals 
used in commercial activities throughout the country.
            aphis/animal care/animal welfare act enforcement
    Bill Language Request: ``The Secretary shall ensure that 
appropriate enforcement action in the form of penalties or case 
referral to the Office of General Counsel or the Department of Justice, 
or both, is taken when a regulated facility violates the Animal Welfare 
Act (7 U.SC. Sec. Sec. 2131-2159), as documented on an inspection 
report, with due consideration to the appropriateness of the penalty 
with respect to the size of the business of the person involved, the 
gravity of the violation, the person's good faith, and the history of 
previous violations, as provided in 7 U.S.C. Sec. 2149(b).
        ``The Secretary shall ensure that any interference with or 
failure to allow access for an inspection under the Animal Welfare Act, 
7 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2131-2159, is documented on an inspection report.
        ``The Secretary shall ensure that all dealers selling dogs, 
cats, and other covered animals online have the necessary license 
pursuant to Animal Welfare Act, 7 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2131-2159, as 
required under 78 Fed. Reg. 57227.
        ``The Secretary of Agriculture shall enter into a memorandum of 
understanding with the U.S. Attorney General to encourage greater 
collaboration on Animal Welfare Act enforcement and ensure that the 
Department of Justice has access to evidence needed to initiate 
cases.''
    Report Language Request: ``Case Referrals for Animal Welfare Act 
(AWA) Violations.--The Committee is concerned that USDA is not fully 
utilizing its enforcement capabilities, particularly for chronic 
violators of the AWA. There has been an overall decline in AWA 
enforcement since 2010, when USDA initiated 874 cases and 74 stipulated 
penalties. By 2021, enforcement had dropped to 262 initiated cases, of 
which 18 resulted in settlements and 17 in administrative orders. The 
Committee directs USDA to use its full enforcement capabilities under 
the AWA, including referring cases to the Office of General Counsel, 
the Department of Justice, or both, when appropriate according to the 
factors the agency must consider under 7 U.S.C. Sec. 2149(b).''
    Justification: The AWA is the chief Federal law for the protection 
of animals. We are concerned about USDA's oversight of regulated 
industries in recent years. While we acknowledge some improvements in 
2021 compared to the previous 4 years, overall there has been a decline 
in AWA enforcement, with far fewer cases initiated, warnings issued, 
and official complaints filed in recent years. In fiscal Year 2021, 
APHIS opened 118 new enforcement cases, which was an improvement 
compared to 2020, but still a decline of more than 50 percent compared 
to the 252 cases opened in fiscal Year 2014. Lower-level actions like 
official warnings were also issued sparingly; in fiscal Year 2016, the 
agency issued almost 200 warnings, but in fiscal Year 2021, it issued 
only 58. It should be noted that this is improved from fiscal Year 
2019, when it issued only two, and in fiscal Year 2020, when it did not 
issue a single one.
    Problems are present throughout the system. In 2018, inspectors 
were issued guidance that allows ailing animals to be diagnosed over 
the phone without a physical veterinary examination or testing, which 
denies animals necessary care and puts the public at risk. These 
guidelines no longer require that euthanasia be carried out according 
to the American Veterinary Medical Association's Guidelines for 
Euthanasia of Animals, which can lead to horrific cases such as a 
Kansas breeder who fatally shot 24 dogs, resulting in a suspension of 
their state license but no penalty from USDA. We are also aware of 
licensees who have repeatedly denied access to their facilities for 
inspections (even before the pandemic) or interfered with USDA's 
collection of information, and have not been cited. There also continue 
to be cases where significant violations have been documented, but USDA 
has opted not to take any enforcement action. One look no further than 
the Envigo case in Virginia, where years of documented noncompliances 
went unaddressed until DOJ took the extraordinary step of seeking 
injunctive relief. At the same time as 4,000 dogs were being removed 
from horrendous conditions to be placed in loving homes, USDA was 
renewing the license of Envigo's parent company. While the scale is 
enormous, this is by no means an isolated case.
    In 2013, USDA issued a rule intended to close loopholes that 
allowed dog breeders to sell puppies online without a USDA license, but 
enforcement with respect to online dealers has been lackluster. As a 
result, many online operations continue to sell puppies sight unseen to 
consumers without the necessary USDA licensing and oversight.
    We are grateful to the Committee and Congress for directing Animal 
Care to document every observed AWA violation on official inspection 
reports and that, as a result, Animal Care finally put an end to its 
``Teachable Moments'' program.
    aphis/animal care/protecting animals with shelter (paws) funding
    Requested Funding: We request that Congress again provide the full 
authorized appropriation of $3 million to continue implementing the 
PAWS grant program as authorized by Section 12502 of Public Law 115-
334. (It should be noted that the program is set up as a pass-through, 
with funds going initially to USDA but the grants being administered by 
DOJ.)
    Requested Report Language: ``The Committee directs the Secretary of 
Agriculture to continue coordinating with the Departments of Justice, 
Housing and Urban Development, and Health and Human Services to 
efficiently implement the grant program for providing emergency and 
transitional shelter options for domestic violence survivors with 
companion animals.''
    Justification: We appreciate that Congress provided $3 million in 
fiscal Year 2023 to continue implementing Section 12502 of the 2018 
Farm Bill (Public Law 115-334), which authorized a new grant program to 
provide emergency and transitional housing options for domestic 
violence survivors with companion animals. Research shows that abusers 
often threaten or inflict violence on pets as a way to intimidate or 
exert control over their partners and prevent them from leaving. In 
fact, nearly half of domestic violence survivors report staying with 
their abuser for fear of what would happen to their pets if they leave. 
This program is successfully ensuring that more survivors feel they can 
leave because safekeeping for their pets is available. The programs 
that have been funded so far represent diversity in geographic areas 
and populations served, as well as in their solutions to the problem of 
how best to assist domestic violence survivors who have companion 
animals. The common thread through them all is the level of excitement 
at being able to reach this highly underserved population of survivors 
and to increase community awareness about this long-standing oversight, 
which would not have been possible with these grants. But there has 
been more demand for grants than the program has been able to meet: For 
FY20 through FY22, 23 grants were awarded, but 81 applications had been 
received. Continued funding is essential.
      usda/office of inspector general/animal fighting enforcement
    Requested Report Language: ``The Committee is concerned about 
illegal animal fighting activity that subjects animals to cruel 
conditions and has the potential to spread illnesses such as virulent 
Newcastle disease and avian flu. The OIG is encouraged to increase its 
enforcement efforts in the States and territories and to pursue animal 
fighting cases even if related concerns, such as money laundering and 
illegal weapons, have not yet been determined to be at issue before an 
investigation is opened. OIG is also encouraged to work with USPS and 
DoJ to examine the prevalence of the illegal shipment of game-fowl used 
in cockfighting. The Committee also encourages the OIG to audit and 
investigate USDA enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act and the Horse 
Protection Act to help improve compliance with these important laws. 
This should include finalizing the reopening of the audit of the Animal 
Care Program Oversight of Dog Breeders to allow completion of in-person 
visits. Additionally, the Committee is concerned about the lack of 
meaningful enforcement of the AWA and HPA and requests that these 
audits should also examine what barriers exist to full enforcement of 
both Acts, and what if any steps can be taken within APHIS' Animal Care 
and Investigative and Enforcement Services programs to ensure that the 
regulated community is held accountable for violations of these Acts.''
         aphis/animal care/emergency preparedness and response
    Requested Funding: We request $1.45 million for Animal Care under 
APHIS' Emergency Preparedness and Response line item.
    Background: APHIS Emergency Preparedness and Response funds enable 
the Animal Care program to support a cooperative agreement on hazard 
preparedness and response for zoos and aquariums, facilitate networking 
efforts for state emergency agriculture officials, update Best 
Practices Documents for animal emergency management, conduct outreach, 
and implement the final rule issued in December 2021 following a 
directive in the fiscal Year 2021 omnibus (86 Fed Reg 68533), which 
requires emergency contingency plans for all facilities regulated under 
the Animal Welfare Act.
  food and drug administration/reducing animal testing and advancing 
                           nonanimal methods
    Requested Funding: We request no less than the fiscal year 2023 
level of $5 million.
    Requested Report Language: ``The Committee directs FDA to 
efficiently and expeditiously utilize existing funds to reduce animal 
testing and advance alternative methods in a measurable and impactful 
way. The agency is further directed to provide a report to the 
Committee within 90 days of enactment that provides details on the 
status of forming the New Alternative Methods Program in the 
Commissioner's office, including but not limited to a description of 
program goals and staffing levels by position classification; FDA's 
priority areas for reducing animal use and advancing alternatives, 
including goals, timelines, and funding associated with each of these 
identified priorities; metrics the agency will sue to measure impact, 
and how the agency will communicate information regarding acceptance of 
alternative methods to the regulated community. The agency should not 
use funding to carry out new animal testing, including to compare the 
use of animals to alternative methods, but instead use existing animal 
data.''
             aphis/animal care/marine mammals in captivity
    Requested Report Language: ``Last year, the Committee directed USDA 
to prioritize and reissue a proposed rulemaking to update regulations 
for the handling and care of marine mammals in captivity. This has not 
happened yet. The Committee continues to be concerned that USDA's 
handling, care, treatment, and transportation standards for marine 
mammals in captivity are seriously outdated. Marine mammal science has 
progressed significantly in the almost 40 years since the most 
important of these regulations were last updated, and the current 
standards do not adequately protect the welfare of captive marine 
mammals. An effort to modernize these standards that began in 2002 
ended in 2021 when a proposed rule published in 2016 was withdrawn, 
recognizing it was now outdated. The Committee reminds APHIS that it 
expects it to prioritize developing and finalizing a humane and 
science-based rule to modernize its marine mammal regulations and 
directs the agency to report back within 6 months on its progress in 
achieving that goal.''
    Justification: It was 1984 when the USDA last updated key elements 
of the handling and care standards for marine mammals. In those nearly 
40 years, significant progress has been made in marine mammal biology 
and ecology research, the results of which should inform Federal care 
regulations, such as increasing minimum space requirements, 
establishing species-specific ambient temperature ranges, and 
mitigating the effects of noise. An effort to modernize these standards 
that began in 2002 ended in 2021 when a proposed rule (81 FR 5629) 
published in 2016 was withdrawn ``due to the age of the analyses on 
which it relies.'' Updating the minimum space requirements is 
especially critical to improve the welfare of captive marine mammals. 
Research within the past 20 years indicates that marine mammals in the 
wild move far more widely than was previously understood, including 
diving to astounding depths. For example, a 2015 study by researchers 
at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and University of Washington 
Seattle found that belugas routinely dive to 2,000 feet, yet the 
current minimum required depth for this species in captivity is only 7 
feet (half the average body length of the species).

             Prepared Statement of Animal Welfare Institute
    The Animal Welfare Institute appreciates the opportunity to submit 
testimony on FY2024 spending priorities for the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's Wildlife 
Services program. AWI is grateful to Congress for the actions it has 
taken over the past several years to encourage Wildlife Services to 
invest in developing and transitioning to nonlethal methods of 
responding to human-wildlife conflict. While the agency has taken small 
steps towards implementing nonlethal methods, leadership from the 
Committee is still needed to ensure this remains a priority for the 
agency because it continues to use inhumane methods, such as M-44 
sodium cyanide devices, that pose a risk to millions of animals, the 
environment, and the public.
                            chemical poisons
    Report language request: ``No Federal funds shall be expended or 
committed for the manufacture, import, purchase, sale, distribution, 
preparation, placement, deployment, training in the use of, or 
authorization for use by third parties, of M-44 sodium cyanide ejector 
devices ('M-44s'), including any of the device's components or parts. 
This prohibition extends to use of Wildlife Services staff time and 
resources in connection with the use of M-44s, including where such 
actions are undertaken in connection with a cooperative agreement, 
except for activities directly related to the removal of M-44s that 
have been placed on federal, Tribal, State, and private land. Nor shall 
Federal funds be expended or committed for the manufacture, import, 
purchase, sale, distribution, preparation, placement, deployment, 
training in the use of, or authorization for use by third parties of 
sodium fluoroacetate ('Compound 1080'), including for livestock 
protection collars.
    ``Exposure to sodium cyanide and Compound 1080 can cause severe, 
unjustifiable suffering and often results in painful, protracted deaths 
for wildlife and family pets, including many non-target animals and 
even people. Use of M-44s and Compound 1080 for wildlife 'control' 
purposes is unsafe for people and animals alike and is an ineffective 
approach to sustainably reducing and preventing human-wildlife conflict 
and livestock losses. The Committee urges Wildlife Services to 
reallocate resources to the provision of technical assistance and 
education to promote, incentivize, implement, and sustain the use of 
nonlethal methods of predator control and coexistence, which can be 
less costly, more effective, and less dangerous to non-target species 
relative to M-44s and Compound 1080.
    ``Just as Federal funds may not be allocated to the use of M-44s or 
Compound 1080, Federal funds may not be used to develop, introduce, or 
reintroduce other chemical poisons, including but not limited to 
alternative delivery mechanisms for sodium cyanide, Compound 1080, and 
other pesticides, for purposes of lethal predator control. This 
prohibition extends to the use of Federal funds to initiate or continue 
research, development, testing, registration, manufacture, preparation, 
or investigation of any chemical poisons or pesticides that may be used 
for lethal predator control.''
    Justification: Lethal animal control devices such as M-44s or 
Compound 1080 cause severe, unnecessary pain and suffering and often 
result in painful deaths of wild animals and family pets. In 2022, 
Wildlife Services killed over 6,000 animals with M-44s, 152 of whom 
were killed unintentionally. These devices have killed family pets and 
have caused severe, irreparable harm to people who have been exposed. 
Sodium cyanide, used in M-44s, and Compound 1080 (sodium 
fluoroacetate), used in livestock collars, are two of the world's 
deadliest poisons and present threats to public health, the 
environment, and national security. With an assortment of safer and 
more effective nonlethal options available, Wildlife Services should no 
longer employ M-44s or Compound 1080 as a means of predator control.
                     nonlethal methods development
    Report language request: ``The Committee is aware that Wildlife 
Services, according to the program's informational materials, has 
worked with landowners to deploy nonlethal predator management 
strategies such as fladry, electric fencing, and livestock guardian 
dogs. However, these efforts have been insufficient, and millions of 
animals continue to be inhumanely killed each year, including thousands 
of nontarget animals. Wildlife Services must implement and prioritize 
nonlethal strategies through the following: (1) promoting and 
implementing nonlethal livestock-predator conflict deterrence and 
mitigation techniques, including but not limited to use of barriers and 
fencing, fladry and turbo-fladry, visual and auditory deterrents, 
livestock protection animals, appropriate husbandry practices, night 
corralling, shed lambing, attractant and carcass removal, livestock 
herding, and human presence; (2) providing training in selection, 
implementation, monitoring, and adaptation of nonlethal techniques for 
agricultural producers, landowners, Federal and State agency personnel, 
and others; and (3) collaborating with the National Wildlife Research 
Center to advance and improve nonlethal predator coexistence methods, 
conduct research on monitoring methods for efficacy of nonlethal 
control methods implemented to reduce predation, and establish clear 
documentation protocols for nonlethal approaches implemented in advance 
of lethal control measures where applicable.
    ``The Committee directs Wildlife Services to fund nonlethal 
predator control activities from a percentage of the United States 
Department of Agriculture's total budget. No less than $5,000,000 of 
existing funds must be allocated towards nonlethal strategies. In FY23, 
the Committee allocated funding specific to nonlethal measures. 
Wildlife Services is directed to provide a report detailing how these 
additional funds were dispersed-including regional distribution, wild 
and domestic species affected, number and size of livestock/
agricultural operations affected, nonlethal tools and methods 
implemented and supported, and efficacy evaluation methods and 
outcomes- within 45 days of the enactment of this act. Wildlife 
Services is also directed to document all work on nonlethal strategies 
development and submit a report demonstrating progress in this area 
within 180 days of the enactment of this act.''
    Justification: It is estimated that USDA's Wildlife Services has 
killed over 34 million animals over the last decade. In 2022, 383,731 
native animals were killed by the agency-more than 2,600 of whom were 
killed unintentionally. The death toll included more than 56,000 
coyotes, 26,000 beavers, 2,400 foxes, and hundreds of gray wolves, 
black bears, mountain lions, and badgers, among many other species. 
These animals were killed using a variety of inhumane methods, such as 
M-44 devices, snares, body-gripping traps, leghold traps, and firearms. 
Lethal predator control methods, often employed to benefit the 
agriculture industry, are proven to be ineffective and inhumane and to 
pose safety risks to both humans and pets, and are more costly than 
nonlethal methods. Predator species are a critical part of healthy 
ecosystems. Employing nonlethal predator control methods will establish 
sustainable coexistence and benefit both the agricultural community and 
the environment.
                                trapping
    Report language request: ``The Committee directs the Secretary to 
allocate $300,000 to institute a 3-year pilot program to replace the 
use of body-gripping traps by agency personnel with non-lethal methods 
and equipment, with the following exceptions:

  --When the body-gripping trap is used to (i) control documented 
        invasive species to achieve resource management objectives 
        where alternative methods have failed; or (ii) protect a 
        species that is (I) listed as an endangered species or 
        threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 
        U.S.C. 1531 et seq.); or (II) treated by the Forest Service as 
        a sensitive species.

  --Exception only applies when: (i) such use of a body-gripping trap 
        is in accordance with applicable State and Federal law; (ii) 
        prior to use of a body-gripping trap, all available and viable 
        nonlethal methods for such control or protection, respectively, 
        are attempted; and (iii) such attempts are documented in 
        writing, and such documentation is maintained at the 
        headquarters of the department that employs the individual 
        engaging in such attempt.''

    Justification: Body-gripping traps, such as snares, Conibear traps, 
and steel-jaw leghold traps, are inhumane and inherently nonselective. 
The nontarget animals caught in these traps include threatened and 
endangered species, as well as family pets. These traps do not belong 
on public lands where families go to enjoy spending time outdoors, and 
where anyone who trips a trap can become a victim.
    Based on funding levels for other predator control programs, 
$300,000 over 3 years would be a reasonable amount to fund a pilot 
program for replacing agency use of body-gripping traps with nonlethal 
methods. The Fish and Wildlife Service's Endangered Species 
Conservation-Wolf Livestock Loss Compensation and Prevention fund tends 
to give $50,000-$100,000 to each recipient. The FWS Fish and Wildlife 
Coordination and Assistance fund was appropriated $150,000 in FY16 (the 
most recent year with data) to award grants to conservation and/or 
environmental projects. Wildlife Services gave Colorado State 
University a $50,028 grant to study nonlethal management of coyote 
predation. This paints a picture of $50,000-150,000 per year for a 
small predator management program, and a 3-year program is advisable to 
obtain meaningful results.
    Thank you for your consideration of our recommendations for how the 
Committee can ensure Wildlife Services prioritizes a transition to 
safer, effective nonlethal methods.

                                 ______
                                 
           Prepared Statement of the Animal Welfare Institute
    Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony on Fiscal Year 
2024 funding priorities for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Below 
are some of the Animal Welfare Institute's top priorities that fall 
under the Food Safety and Inspection Service, Farm Service Agency, and 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service pertaining to the humane 
treatment of farmed animals and equines.
  food safety and inspection service--humane methods of slaughter act 
                              enforcement
    Effective enforcement of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act can 
prevent abuses like those documented in undercover investigations and 
reduce the chance of associated food safety risks and costly recalls of 
meat and egg products. The number of FTEs required under annual 
appropriations for enforcement of the HMSA has remained at 148 since 
FY12, despite the fact that actual staffing levels have consistently 
been above this number for the past decade. To more accurately reflect 
previous staffing levels that have proven to increase the number of 
humane handling verification procedures performed and align with the 
agency's staffing commitments, 165 FTEs should be appropriated. We also 
request that the agency continue publishing the Humane Handling 
Quarterly Reports--as previously directed by the FY21, FY22 and FY23 
agriculture appropriations reports--to allow for timely and efficient 
access to information pertinent to monitoring HMSA enforcement. AWI 
greatly appreciates the Committee's attention to this matter given that 
Humane Handling Quarterly Reports provide critical information that 
promotes transparency and public trust in FSIS's oversight of the 
treatment of animals slaughtered at USDA inspected facilities.
    Bill language request: No fewer than 165 full-time equivalent 
positions shall be employed during fiscal year 2024 for purposes 
dedicated solely to inspections and enforcement related to the Humane 
Methods of Slaughter Act. This number is in addition to the Humane 
Handling Enforcement Coordinator and District Veterinary Medical 
Specialist positions.
    Report language request: FSIS shall ensure that all inspection 
personnel conducting humane handling verification procedures receive 
robust initial training and periodic refresher training on the FSIS 
humane handling and slaughter regulations and directives. This includes 
handling of non-ambulatory disabled animals, as well as proper use of 
the Humane Activities Tracking System to ensure humane handling of 
animals as they arrive and are offloaded and handled in ante-mortem 
holding pens, suspect pens, chutes, stunning areas, and on the 
processing line. The Committee directs the agency to continue 
preparation and online publication of the Humane Handling Quarterly 
Reports, to include: (1) the number of humane handling verification 
procedures performed, (2) the number of administrative enforcement 
actions taken, (3) time spent on Humane Handling Activities Tracking 
System activities, and (4) comparisons of these measurements by plant 
size and FSIS district.
 food safety and inspection service--poultry slaughter good commercial 
                               practices
    USDA has documented a variety of serious humane handling problems 
at poultry slaughter plants, including birds drowning in scalding 
tanks, disposal of live birds under piles of dead birds, birds dying 
due to suffocation and/or prolonged exposure to extreme weather, and 
mechanical problems resulting in injury and death. In 2005, USDA issued 
a notice to slaughter establishments that acknowledged the link between 
inhumane treatment of birds and adulterated poultry products, and 
referenced industry ``Good Commercial Practices'' for bird handling. 
Subsequently, USDA inspectors began conducting verification of these 
requirements for live bird handling in every federally inspected plant. 
However, inspector oversight appears to vary widely at poultry 
slaughter establishments. According to USDA enforcement records, 
between 2018 and 2020, nearly one-half (42 percent) of federally 
inspected poultry plants were not issued any enforcement records 
documenting GCP compliance. In order to determine why the reporting of 
GCP compliance varies so dramatically among inspection personnel, USDA 
should begin tracking the time inspectors spend on GCP-related 
activities. Information gained from this monitoring will also assist 
USDA and Congress in determining the level of inspector oversight 
needed to prevent repeated incidents of bird mistreatment that has the 
potential to result in poultry product adulteration.
    Report language request: The Committee recognizes that the humane 
handling of birds at slaughter according to Good Commercial Practices 
(GCPs) reduces the occurrence of adulterated poultry products in the 
marketplace and can improve the treatment of birds at slaughter. The 
Committee awaits the Department's briefing requested in the fiscal year 
2022 and 2023 reports on documented instances where establishments lost 
control of their processes for handling birds, and consequently were 
not operating in accordance with GCPs. Further, the Committee directs 
the USDA to track the number of inspector hours spent on GCP 
verification activities intended to reduce instances of adulteration 
using its existing Humane Activities Tracking System or other 
appropriate method.
            farm service agency--livestock indemnity program
    The Livestock Indemnity Program compensates producers for farmed 
animal injuries and deaths caused by adverse weather and natural 
disasters. The number of farmed animals that die from adverse weather 
events is immense--as is the amount of Federal funds disbursed under 
LIP. According to data from the USDA Economic Research Service, 
USAspending.gov, and public records obtained via FOIA, LIP payments 
have totaled over $500 million since 2008. However, producers are not 
required to demonstrate that they provide animals with basic 
protections from extreme weather or that they have disaster plans in 
place before receiving taxpayer dollars under LIP. Disaster 
preparedness plans are widely supported by agriculture industry groups 
and are recommended by both the American Veterinary Medical Association 
and the USDA. To save taxpayer dollars and mitigate losses, USDA should 
require that producers have disaster preparedness plans for the 
issuance of payments under LIP.
    Bill language request: Livestock Indemnity Payments for Adverse 
Weather. For expenses involved in making indemnity payments to eligible 
livestock owners or contract growers, such sums as may be necessary: 
Provided, That the Secretary shall ensure that no funds are used for 
issuing payments under the program, unless the applicant offers 1) a 
disaster preparedness plan that is specific to the species of animal(s) 
and region of the country, and 2) a description of how the plan was 
executed to prevent livestock injuries or deaths.
    Report language request: Disaster Preparedness.--The Committee 
recognizes that millions of farmed animals die each year due to the 
effects of adverse weather, and extreme weather events are occurring at 
increased frequency, putting additional livestock at risk of injury and 
death. The committee also is cognizant that veterinary and agricultural 
trade associations recognize the importance of disaster planning in 
preventing the extent of livestock deaths. Therefore, the Committee 
directs USDA to require written disaster preparedness plans for the 
issuance of payments under the Livestock Indemnity Program.
    food safety and inspection service and animal and plant health 
      inspection service--enforcement of the twenty-eight hour law
    The Twenty-Eight Hour Law is the only Federal law aimed at 
providing basic protections for farmed animals transported across the 
United States; unfortunately, oversight of compliance is virtually 
nonexistent even though available evidence and investigations have 
revealed numerous instances where animals were transported in excess of 
28 hours without food, water, or rest. Given that the statute is not 
actively enforced by any of the agencies responsible for doing so, 
report language should direct USDA and DOT to develop a mechanism 
(e.g., through guidance, policies, or regulations) to monitor 
compliance (e.g., by integrating checks into routine roadside 
inspections that are already being conducted by DOT, during humane 
handling verifications conducted by FSIS at federally inspected 
livestock slaughter establishments, and/or during live animal export 
inspections conducted by APHIS). Transport can be very stressful for 
animals, as they are subjected to increased handling, exposure to 
temperature extremes, and long journeys involving overcrowding and food 
and water deprivation. At a bare minimum, ensuring that the Twenty-
Eight Hour Law is being followed would vastly improve conditions. 
Moreover, better protecting the health and welfare of these animals 
helps to prevent the spread of disease and reduce incidences of injury, 
infection, and mortality due to the stresses associated with transport.
    Report language request: Enforcement of the Twenty-Eight Hour Law.-
Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this act, the 
Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of 
Transportation, shall develop a mechanism for conducting investigations 
or inspections, including but not limited to inspection of any vehicle 
or vessel transporting animals or any written or electronic records 
associated with such transport of animals, to determine whether any 
rail carrier, express carrier, or common carrier, a receiver, trustee, 
or lessee of one of those carriers, or an owner or master of a vessel 
transporting animals has violated or is violating the Twenty-Eight Hour 
Law (Section 80502 of title 49, United States Code).
     food safety and inspection service--horse slaughter facility 
                              inspections
    Horse slaughter does not occur in the United States due to the 
inclusion of annual appropriations language blocking the use of Federal 
funds to inspect horse slaughter facilities, thereby preventing these 
facilities from legally operating on U.S. soil. Before horse slaughter 
facilities closed in the United States, USDA itself documented horrific 
incidents of cruelty. Horses--which serve as companion, working, and 
performance animals--have a strong fight-or-flight reflex and 
instinctively thrash their long necks when panicked. Rendering horses 
unconscious prior to slaughter can be extremely difficult as stunning 
them often requires repeated blows to the head. In addition to well-
documented animal abuse within the predatory horse slaughter industry, 
the consumption of horse meat presents a significant food safety 
concern. Horses are not raised for human consumption in the United 
States and are regularly administered a wide range of drugs that are 
expressly prohibited by the Food and Drug Administration for use in 
food animals.
    Bill language request: Hereafter, none of the funds made available 
by this act or any other act may be used to pay the salaries or 
expenses of personnel- 1) to inspect horses under section 3 of the 
Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C 603); (2) to inspect horses under 
section 903 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 
1996 (7 U.S.C. 1901 note; Public Law 104-127); or (3) to implement or 
enforce section 352.19 of title 9, Code of Federal Regulations (or a 
successor regulation).
    Report language request: Nearly every year since 2005, Congress has 
prohibited equines from being slaughtered for human consumption in the 
United States by restricting the USDA's use of funds for slaughter 
inspections. Despite Congressional intent to shutter the horse 
slaughter industry through this prohibition, thousands of equines 
continue to be exported to foreign abattoirs annually. The Committee is 
deeply concerned with the welfare of American horses caught in the 
slaughter pipeline and the economic impacts that this practice has on 
the American equine community. Therefore, the Committee directs the 
USDA to cease all activities that allow, facilitate, or otherwise 
support the horse slaughter industry, including the transport or export 
of American equines for human consumption.
   animal and plant health inspection service--horse protection act 
                              enforcement
    We appreciate Congress providing $$4.096 million in FY23 for USDA 
to improve enforcement of the Horse Protection Act and combat the 
abusive practices associated with soring. A 2010 Office of Inspector 
report outlined serious conflicts of interest with the industry self-
monitoring system by Horse Industry Organizations on which USDA still 
relies. In 2021, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and 
Medicine issued a report that echoed OIG's findings and called for an 
end to the industry self-policing system. But although USDA announced 
final regulations in 2017 to eliminate industry self-policing and 
institute other reforms to end soring, these widely supported 
regulations were frozen by the last administration. We appreciate 
Congress's past inclusion of language directing USDA to finalize a long 
overdue rulemaking that would substantially improve HPA enforcement.
    Report language request: The Committee provides $4,096,000 for 
enforcement of the Horse Protection Act of 1970, as amended (15 U.S.C. 
1831), and reminds the Secretary that Congress granted the agency 
primary responsibility to enforce this law, including the training of 
all inspectors. The Committee urges the Secretary to issue the new 
proposed HPA rule expeditiously, consistent with the agency's announced 
intentions in December 2021, and to finalize and publish the new final 
rule by December 31, 2023. The Committee further urges the Secretary to 
ensure that the new rule includes at a minimum all the key elements of 
the final rule, ``Horse Protection; Licensing of Designated Qualified 
Persons and Other Amendments'' [Docket No. APHIS-2011-0009], that was 
finalized and displayed in advance public notice in the Federal 
Register on January 19, 2017.

             Prepared Statement of Animal Welfare Institute
    The Animal Welfare Institute, a national nonprofit animal welfare 
advocacy organization, respectfully asks the Committee to allocate 
$500,000 for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural 
Statistics Service to expand the scope of its annual mink survey to 
collect and publish additional data about mink farms, and to collect 
data about other types of fur farms. This will increase transparency 
regarding the total number of animals bred and killed for fur in the 
U.S., and whether public safety measures are enforced to curb disease 
transmission.
                  mink farms pose a public health risk
    Mink on fur farms incubate and transmit diseases such as COVID-19 
and avian influenza, creating circumstances that threaten to worsen the 
current pandemic and usher in the next one. Mink pose a high risk to 
humans because their upper respiratory tract is exceptionally well 
suited to be a conduit to ours, making them effective ``mixing 
vessels'' to create novel pandemic viruses.\1\ Furthermore, fur farms 
house mink in crowded environments that create an ideal setting for 
pathogens to circulate among and across species.\2\ Wire cages are 
packed together and may be stacked on top of each other so that urine 
and excrement falls on the animals below. Given the conditions of 
confinement, these animals are highly stressed and thus 
immunocompromised, making them more susceptible to infection. The 
absence of legal requirements for veterinary care only compounds the 
problem.

    Mink are highly susceptible to COVID-19, which has infected tens of 
thousands of mink in the U.S.\3\ and millions more internationally. 
Even more alarmingly, they are capable of passing a mutated form of the 
virus back to humans. Mink to human transmission of the virus has been 
reported in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Poland, and the U.S. Four 
people in Michigan were infected with a unique COVID-19 strain traced 
back to mink.\4\ Spillback from mink farms to humans could introduce 
new variants, undermining the effectiveness of vaccines and 
jeopardizing efforts to contain the pandemic.\5\ Like humans, mink can 
become infected with COVID-19 without showing symptoms, thus 
potentially serving as an undetected reservoir of the disease. Escapees 
from these farms can also transmit the virus to wild populations, 
potentially fostering reservoirs of the virus off the farms. In 
December 2020, a wild mink captured near a mink farm in Utah tested 
positive for a variant of COVID-19 indistinguishable from the virus 
found in nearby infected farmed mink--demonstrating the broader dangers 
posed.\6\

    In addition, a deadly avian influenza virus (H5N1) infected mink on 
a fur farm in Spain in October 2022. Before this outbreak, the virus 
spread primarily through contact with infected birds, not between 
mammals. However, in Spain it spread from mink to mink and gained at 
least one mutation that favors mammal-to-mammal spread.\7\ H5N1, which 
has spread swiftly among birds around the world since 2020, could 
infect other mink farms and mutate to become transmissible between 
humans.\8\ Scientists are sounding the alarm on this H5N1 outbreak in 
Spain, calling it a ``clear mechanism for an H5 pandemic to start'' and 
``a warning bell.''

                        annual mink farm survey
    It is vital that the USDA heed the recommendations of the World 
Health Organization,\9\ the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations,\10\ and other global health and food safety 
organizations that recommend monitoring fur farms more closely. 
Implementing these recommendations will require the agency to collect 
more data than it currently does.

    There is no way to know the total number of animals bred and killed 
on fur farms in the U.S. each year, and there are no Federal 
regulations governing the operation of fur farms. There is little 
transparency regarding what, if, or how public safety measures are 
implemented on these farms to curb disease transmission. A small amount 
of data on mink farms is compiled by the USDA in an annual market 
report as part of its reporting on agricultural commodities.\11\ 
However, no data are collected on fox, lynx, bobcat, or other animals 
farmed for fur.

    Not only does the lack of meaningful Federal or state oversight 
mean that animals can be bred, housed, and killed in inhumane ways, but 
it also means that it is impossible to easily monitor the potential 
infectious diseases incubated or spread at these farms.
    Thus, AWI recommends an additional $500,000 for the National 
Agricultural Statistics Service to expand the scope of its annual mink 
survey to collect and publish additional data about mink farms, and to 
collect data about other types of fur farms.
    Accompanying this funding, AWI urges the inclusion of a directive 
outlining the information to be gathered and published in this survey, 
including at minimum: the full contact information for all fur farm 
owners and operators; the address for each place of business where a 
fur farm conducted business; the legal descriptions of any lands upon 
which the fur farm conducted business; all trade names under which the 
fur farm conducted business; the number of individuals who worked on 
each farm; the number and sex of individual animals raised for fur; the 
source of each individual animal raised for fur; a detailed description 
of how the animals were transported, including the route taken, if 
applicable; the number of individual animals purchased, transferred, or 
sold and the name of each person or entity to whom or from whom such 
animals were purchased, transferred, or sold; a description of the 
size, number, and type of the fur farm's pens, cages, or other such 
enclosures; a description of the barrier(s) used to contain the animals 
raised for fur on the farm, as well as the barriers used to prevent 
other animals from gaining access to the farm; a description of the 
procedures the fur farm uses to dispose of manure, carcasses and any 
parts thereof; a description of the practices and procedures used by 
the fur farm to ensure the health and safety of farm workers, the 
public, and animals on and around the farm; the number of animals 
raised for fur that died or were killed, the cause of death, and, if 
killed by humans, the reason each was killed and the method used; a 
description of the measures the fur farm adhered to in compliance with 
the current American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines relevant 
to fur farm operations, including euthanasia and depopulation; and a 
description of the measures the fur farm adhered to in compliance with 
the latest guidelines and recommendations developed by the USDA, the 
CDC, and any other Federal agencies, in order to prevent the 
transmission of COVID-19 or other diseases to other captive furbearing 
animals or to wildlife, fur farm workers, and the public.
    To help curb the current pandemic-and to prevent the next one-we 
must gain a better understanding of fur farms in the U.S. Thank you for 
your consideration of our recommendations for how the Committee can 
direct the USDA to provide this information to Congress and to the 
public.

   Prepared Statement of the Campaign for Contract Agriculture Reform
    I am submitting this testimony on behalf of the Campaign for 
Contract Agriculture Reform (CCAR) regarding our fiscal year 2024 
funding requests for USDA programs.
    The Campaign for Contract Agriculture Reform (CCAR) is a national 
alliance of organizations working to provide a voice for farmers and 
ranchers involved in contract agriculture, as well as the communities 
in which they live. The member organizations of CCAR include Farm Aid,

Packers and Stockyards Act Oversight and Enforcement
Packers and Stockyards Program--$35 million

    We commend the Subcommittee for its strong support for Packers and 
Stockyards Act oversight and enforcement in the Fiscal Year 2023 
Omnibus Appropriations bill, and in the preliminary Agriculture 
Appropriations bill and report that informed the final bill.
    The Packers and Stockyard Act is a strong statute that provides 
broad protections for farmers against unfair, deceptive, 
discriminatory, and unduly preferential or prejudicial practices of 
livestock and poultry companies. Unfortunately, the lack of clear 
regulations to define the terms of the statute and provide clarity 
about USDA interpretation of those protections has hindered 
enforcement, to the detriment of poultry growers and livestock farmers 
and ranchers.
    When the Packers and Stockyards Act (PSA) was passed in 1921, it 
came at a time of great concern by Americans about the concentration 
and related market power of meatpackers and other agricultural 
processors. Congress passed the PSA because it realized that while 
existing antitrust laws (Sherman Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, and 
the Clayton Antitrust Act) address mergers, acquisition, and business 
practices that unlawfully harm competition in the marketplace, those 
statutes do not address harms to individual farmers and ranchers caused 
by unlawful practices of powerful meatpackers and poultry companies. 
Indeed, the primary focus of Congress in passing the PSA and its 
amendments was to ensure that USDA could address meatpacker and poultry 
company actions that harm farmers and ranchers individually. In fact, 
the primary farmer and rancher protection provisions of the Packers and 
Stockyards Act [Section 202(a) and (b)] focus on meatpacker and poultry 
company harms to farmers and ranchers, without establishing any 
requirement for farmers or USDA to prove that those practices have also 
harmed competition in the marketplace broadly.
    While market consolidation and the power of meatpackers in 1921 was 
a major impetus for Congress to pass the Packers and Stockyards Act, 
it's important to note that meat and poultry markets are even more 
consolidated now than they were in 1921. In addition, more recent 
vertical integration structures through poultry and hog contracting 
practices, and certain cattle contracting practices, have allowed those 
firms to shift economic risks onto the backs of the farmers and 
ranchers with whom they contract. The current market conditions for 
livestock and poultry make PSA enforcement, and the regulatory updates 
to support that enforcement, more important now than ever.
    Therefore, CCAR is supporting the request in the President's budget 
for $35 million for the Packers and Stockyards program within the 
Agricultural Marketing Service. We would also strongly oppose any 
efforts by Congress to place limitations on USDA's authority to 
finalize Packers and Stockyards Act regulatory updates.
    In addition, CCAR requests the inclusion of the following report 
language to address these issues:

                The Committee recognizes that consolidation in 
                agribusiness can be detrimental to farmers, consumers, 
                workers, and the environment. The Committee considers 
                enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act a top 
                priority and directs the Department to continue 
                enforcing the Act to the fullest extent of the law. 
                Further, the Committee urges the USDA Agricultural 
                Marketing Service (AMS) and other agencies and mission 
                areas to fully incorporate fair and competitive markets 
                priorities across relevant programs and operations.

    Thank you for the opportunity to provide this testimony about the 
Fiscal Year 2024 Agriculture Appropriations process.

Prepared Statement of the Campaign for Family Farms and the Environment
     u.s. department of agriculture, agricultural marketing service
    The Campaign for Family Farms and the Environment (CFFE) is a 
coalition of State and national organizations, including Dakota Rural 
Action, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, Land Stewardship 
Project, Missouri Rural Crisis Center, Food & Water Watch and Institute 
for Agriculture and Trade Policy. Our organizations work together to 
change policies that promote consolidation in animal agriculture at the 
expense of independent family farms, rural and urban economies, workers 
and public health.
             competitive markets for livestock and poultry
    It has been clear for decades that lack of enforcement of the 
Packers and Stockyards Act (PSA), along with unchecked mergers of meat 
and poultry companies, has allowed large buyers to exercise extreme 
market power at the expense of livestock producers and contract 
growers. This has led to devastating changes in the structure of 
livestock and poultry markets around the country, and removed any 
chance for economic viability for many independent producers.
    CFFE members have lived through this transition, particularly in 
hog markets, which in the 1980s offered small independent producers in 
the Midwest flexibility and the potential for profitability by 
including livestock in their farming operations. But by the mid-1990's, 
Midwestern farmers saw the rise of buyer power by the largest packers 
shift the market away from cash sales and limit or eliminate market 
access for smaller sellers. Producers who lived through the upheaval of 
the hog market collapse in the late 1990's describe how the buying 
stations they depended on to purchase hogs disappeared, leaving them to 
deal directly with very large packers who openly stated that they would 
pay producers with smaller herds less per head. This drove out 
independent producers, to be replaced with large, industrialized 
operations raising contracted hogs, to devastating effect for rural 
communities. Now, there is essentially no cash market for hogs. As a 
recent USDA proposed rule points out, today, ``in effect, the only 
production/marketing choice for a hog producer is to enter a 
contract.'' \1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While structural changes in cattle markets have not yet driven 
independent producers completely out of the market as happened in the 
hog sector, the same trends are developing on a longer timeline. The 
USDA notes that for cattle ``there are commonly only one or two buyers 
in some local geographic markets, and few sellers have the option of 
selling fed cattle to more than three or four packers.'' \2\ And that 
``since 2005, negotiated cash trades have declined from 65 percent to 
about 27 percent today.'' \3\ This transition replaced cash trades with 
contracts and alternative marketing arrangements that not only 
eliminate producers' access to cash markets, but also eliminate 
opportunities for price discovery and create another avenue for packers 
to advantage some producers over others.

    There are many reforms needed to address the stranglehold that a 
handful of multinational corporations have on each step of the 
livestock and protein supply chain. CFFE appreciates the committee's 
recognition of these issues in the FY23 funding bill with the inclusion 
of report language and funding for enforcement of the PSA. We urge you 
to continue to include following report language in fiscal Year 2024:

                The Committee recognizes that consolidation in 
                agribusiness can be detrimental to farmers, consumers, 
                workers, and the environment. The Committee considers 
                enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act a top 
                priority and directs the Department to continue 
                enforcing the act to the fullest extent of the law. 
                Further, the Committee urges the USDA Agricultural 
                Marketing Service (AMS) and other agencies and mission 
                areas to fully incorporate fair and competitive markets 
                priorities across relevant programs and operations.
             enforcement of the packers and stockyards act
    Livestock and poultry markets are based on asymmetric information, 
limited or nonexistent price discovery, extreme buyer power at the 
regional level, and widespread retaliation and deception in many forms. 
To address these systemic problems, producers need a comprehensive set 
of regulations, along with a strategy for robust enforcement by the 
USDA. CFFE supports the regulatory updates and clarifications to the 
PSA currently being promulgated by the Agricultural Marketing Service's 
Packers and Stockyards Division.
    In addition to providing a long overdue update to improve 
enforcement of the PSA, these rules will serve as an important 
complement to the USDA's plans to invest significant resources into new 
and expanded meat and poultry processing infrastructure. If the USDA 
does not also prioritize robust enforcement of antitrust laws to level 
the playing field in these markets, these investments will not create 
processing capacity that is economically viable in the long-term.
    We oppose any efforts to interfere with the USDA's rulemaking 
authority and the ongoing Packers and Stockyards Act rulemakings in the 
appropriations process or other legislation. Additionally, we request 
that the Committee provide AMS with additional funding for Packers and 
Stockyards Act enforcement at the $35 million level.
                        cattle contracts library
    We encourage the Committee to renew the Cattle Contracts Library 
pilot program that was first appropriated in FY23. This pilot program 
has just begun to provide information to producers and others, and 
needs more time to provide desperately needed transparency about what 
types of contracts are being offered by large meatpackers to cattle 
producers.

   Prepared Statement of Central Arizona Water Conservation District
    On behalf of the Central Arizona Water Conservation District

Department of Agriculture's Environmental Quality Incentives Program 
Financial Assistance (EQIP FA) for the Colorado River Basin Salinity

Colorado River water into central and southern Arizona. The largest 
supplier of renewable water in Arizona, CAP delivers up to 1.5 million 
acre-feet of Arizona's 2.8-million-acre-foot Colorado River entitlement 
each year to municipal and industrial users, agricultural irrigation 
districts, and Indian communities.
    Our goal at CAWCD is to provide an affordable, reliable and 
sustainable supply of Colorado River water to a service area that 
includes more than 80 percent of Arizona's population.
    These renewable water supplies are critical to Arizona's economy 
and to the economies of Native American communities throughout the 
state. Nearly 90 percent of economic activity in the State of Arizona 
occurs within CAP's service area. The canal provides an economic 
benefit of $100 billion annually, accounting for one-third of the 
entire Arizona gross state product. CAP also helps the State of Arizona 
meet its water management and regulatory objectives of reducing 
groundwater use and ensuring availability of groundwater as a 
supplemental water supply during future droughts. Achieving and 
maintaining these water management objectives is critical to the long-
term sustainability of a State as arid as Arizona.
                 negative impacts of concentrated salts
    Natural and man-induced salt loading to the Colorado River creates 
environmental and economic damages. EPA has identified that more than 
60 percent of the salt load of the Colorado River comes from natural 
sources. With the significant Federal ownership in the Basin, most of 
this comes from federally administered lands. Human activity, 
principally irrigation, adds to the salt load of the Colorado River. 
Further, natural and human activities concentrate the dissolved salts 
in the River.
    The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has estimated 
quantifiable damages at about $354 million per year. Modeling by 
Reclamation indicates that damages will rise to approximately $671 
million per year by 2040 without continuation of the Program. These 
damages include:

  --A reduction in the ability to reclaim and reuse water for 
        beneficial uses, including drinking water and irrigation water 
        supplies, due to high salinities in the water delivered to 
        water treatment and reclamation facilities;

  --A reduction in the yield of salt sensitive crops and increased 
        water use to meet the leaching requirements in the agricultural 
        sector;

  --Increased use of imported water and cost of desalination and brine 
        disposal for recycling water in the municipal sector;

  --An increase in the use of water and the cost of water treatment, 
        and an increase in sewer fees in the industrial sector;

  --An increase in the cost of cooling operations and the cost of water 
        softening, and a decrease in equipment service life in the 
        commercial sector;
  --A reduction in the useful life of galvanized water pipe systems, 
        water heaters, faucets, garbage disposals, clothes washers, and 
        dishwashers, and increased use of bottled water and water 
        softeners in the household sector;

  --A decrease in the life of treatment facilities and pipelines in the 
        utility sector, and

  --Difficulty in meeting wastewater discharge requirements to comply 
        with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit 
        terms and conditions, and an increase in desalination and brine 
        disposal costs due to accumulation of salts in groundwater 
        basins.

    The threat of salinity continues to be a concern between the United 
States and Mexico. Since the agreement of Minute 242 in 1973 to the 
1944 Water Treaty, the United States has taken several actions to 
improve the quality of water delivered to Mexico, including operating 
and maintaining the Main Outlet Drain Extension (MODE). More recently, 
on November 20, 2012, a 5-year agreement, known as Minute 319, was 
signed between the U.S. and Mexico to guide future management of the 
Colorado River. Among the key issues addressed in Minute 319 included 
an agreement to maintain current salinity management and existing 
salinity standards. The United States, Mexico, and key water users, 
including CAWCD, worked since 2015 to develop a successor agreement, 
Minute 323, which was finalized on September 27, 2017. Minute 323 
continues collaboration and cooperation among the United States and 
Mexico with respect to salinity control in the Colorado River system. 
The CAWCD and other key water providers are committed to meeting these 
goals.
    Adequate funding for salinity control will prevent the water 
quality of the Colorado River from further degradation and avoid 
significant increases in economic damages to municipal, industrial and 
irrigation users.
                               conclusion
    Implementation of salinity control practices through EQIP has 
proven to be a very cost-effective method of controlling the salinity 
in the Colorado River. CAWCD urges the subcommittee to include $12.2 
million from the USDA's Environmental Quality Incentive Program 
Financial Assistance for the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control 
Program in the Fiscal Year 2024 Appropriation bill. Additionally, there 
is needed sufficient Technical Assistance dollars to adequately 
implement the program. The funding level will prevent the further 
degradation of water quality of the Colorado River, and significantly 
increased damages from the higher salt concentrations to municipal, 
industrial and irrigation users.

    Prepared Statement of the Center for Invasive Species Prevention
    The Center for Invasive Species Prevention (CISP) and the Vermont 
Woodlands Association (VWA) urge continued support by the subcommittee 
on Agriculture and related agencies for a Federal program that is key 
to protecting America's urban and rural forests from pest-caused 
mortality: the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). 
APHIS is responsible for preventing introduction and spread of pests 
that harm agriculture, including forests. While most port inspections 
are carried out by the Department of Homeland Security Bureau of 
Customs and Border Protection, APHIS sets the policy guidance. APHIS 
also inspects imports of living plants.

    We thank you for recent incremental funding increases for these 
programs. We welcome the additional increases proposed by the 
Administration. Unfortunately, more substantial investments are needed.
    Introduced pests threaten many forest products and services 
benefitting all Americans. These include wood products; wildlife 
habitat; carbon sequestration; clean water and air; storm water 
management; lower energy costs; improved health; aesthetic enjoyment; 
and jobs. Already, the 15 most damaging non-native pests threaten at 
least 41 percent of forest biomass in the ``lower 48'' States. These 15 
species have caused an additional annual conversion of live biomass to 
dead wood at a rate similar in magnitude to that attributed to fire 
(5.53 TgC per year for pests v. 5.4 to 14.2 TgC per year for fire).\1\

    These pests also impose significant costs that are borne 
principally by municipal governments and homeowners. As more pests have 
been accidentally introduced, these costs have risen. By 2050,\2\ 1.4 
million street trees in urban areas and communities will probably be 
killed by introduced insect pests. High costs will be seen in Milwaukee 
and Madison Wisconsin; the Chicago area; Cleveland; and Baltimore, 
Towson, and Salisbury, Maryland. Removing and replacing these trees is 
projected to cost cities $30 million per year. Additional trees in 
parks, on homeowners' properties, and in urban woodlands--will also die 
and require removal and replacement.

    Tree-killing pests are linked to the international supply chain. 
Many pests-especially the highly damaging wood-borers-arrive in 
inadequately treated crates and pallets made of wood.
    Imports from Asia transport the most damaging pests, e.g., Asian 
longhorned beetle, emerald ash borer, redbay ambrosia beetle, and the 
invasive shot hole borers. U.S. imports from Asia involve an estimated 
20 million shipping containers annually. At least 33,000 of these 
containers, perhaps twice that number,\3\ probably carry a tree-killing 
pest. If an Asian wood-boring insect that attacks maples or oaks were 
introduced, it could kill 6.1 million trees and cost American cities 
$4.9 billion over 30 years.\4\ The risk would be highest if this pest 
were introduced to the South--a growing likelihood given rising direct 
shipments from Asia following the expansion of the Panama Canal in 
2016.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Since 2006, all countries shipping goods to North America must 
treat their wood packaging according to specified protocols in the 
International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) #15. However, 
as of 2020, 0.22 percent [1/5th of 1 percent] of the shipping 
containers entering the U.S. were infested by a tree-killing insect.\5\ 
This equates to tens of thousands of containers harboring tree-killing 
insects.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ Haack et al. op cit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Worse, trade partners' compliance with the rules has deteriorated; 
the ``approach rate'' of pest-infested wood packaging fell in 2005-
2006, but has since gone back up. The most troubling of offenders is 
China. China has been required to treat its wood packaging since 
December 1998. Nevertheless, in the 2010-2020 period, 0.73 percent [or 
3/4 of 1 percent] of its wood packaging contained a tree-killing pest. 
This is three times the global average for the period. China supplied 
40.7 percent of U.S. imports in 2022,\6\ (5,655,000 containers), so it 
alone might be sending to our shores 30,000 containers infested with 
tree-killing insects. These pests threaten all our forests and the 
ecosystem services they provide.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

share to more than a decade low.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We suggest that the subcommittee ask APHIS what steps it will take 
to end China's noncompliance. (The Department of Homeland Security's 
Bureau of Customs and Border Protection has twice strengthened its 
enforcement of wood packaging rules. In 2017 it began penalizing 
importers of non-compliant wood packaging under Title 19 of the United 
States Code. In 2021, it incorporated the wood packaging requirements 
into its voluntary C-TPAC program.)
    ISPM#15 per se is falling short at the global level. The presence 
of the mark indicating that a crate or pallet complies with ISPM#15 is 
not reliable. Therefore we suggest further that the subcommittee ask 
APHIS what steps it is taking at the global level to improve the 
efficacy of ISPM#15--or to replace it if necessary to ensure that pests 
are not being introduced.
    Other pests-especially plant diseases and sap sucking insects-come 
on imported plants. The U.S. imported about 5 billion plants in 
2021.\7\ Recent introductions probably via this pathway include several 
pathogens-e.g. rapid ?ohi?a death in Hawai`i, beech leaf disease 
(established from Ohio to Maine), and boxwood blight. Insects have also 
been introduced on imported plants recently; one example is the elm 
zigzag sawfly (present in North Carolina, Virginia, and New York).

    In 2009,\8\ approximately 12 percent of plant shipments were 
infested by a pest. This pest approach rate is more than 50 times 
higher than the 0.22 percent approach rate for wood packaging. APHIS 
has adopted several changes to its phytosanitary system for imported 
plants in the decade since 2009. The few analyses published have not 
considered pathogens. We suggest that the subcommittee ask APHIS to 
facilitate an independent analysis of the efficacy of the agency's 
current phytosanitary programs to prevent introductions of pests on 
important plants, with an emphasis on introductions of plant pathogens.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Once introduced, invasive pests do not stay in the cities where 
they first arrived. Instead, they proliferate and spread--often 
facilitated by movement of firewood, plants, and outdoor household 
goods such as patio furniture.
    APHIS is responsible for preventing spread of the sudden oak death 
pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, through trade in nursery plants. In 
recent years California has had few detections in nurseries and little 
expansion in forests--probably because the drought suppressed the 
fungus. This year's very wet winter will probably lead to a new disease 
outbreaks. In cooler, wetter conditions in Oregon and Washington, 
detections in nurseries and in the forest or plantings continue.
    In 2022, P. ramorum was detected at 18 establishment, 12 of which 
were first-time detections. We believe reduced funding in support for 
the California nursery regulatory program are unwise given the increase 
in outbreaks likely to result from the wet 2022-2023 winter. Oregon and 
Washington continue to detect infestations in additional retailers 
brought in by plants bought from other nurseries. Washington responded 
to several ``trace forward'' incidents, one involving more than 160 
residential sites. APHIS' program is not succeeding in eradicating P. 
ramorum from nurseries. We suggest that the subcommittee ask APHIS what 
steps it is taking to improve the efficacy of the SOD program.
    In the East, P. ramorum was found in three of 65 streams sampled in 
10 primarily southeastern States. Most troubling is the first-time 
detection in South Carolina. P. ramorum has now been detected from 
eight streams in four States, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, and 
now South Carolina. The pathogen has been present in some of these 
streams for more than 10 years. Is it established?
    Oregon faces particularly high risks because three of the four 
known genetic strains of Phytopthora ramorum are established in the 
State's forests. This proliferation is likely to promote more 
aggressive infections, so exacerbating the disease. How did these three 
strains enter the U.S.?
    Beech trees so important to wildlife conservation in the Northeast 
are under attack by two pathogens and at risk to an insect. Most 
alarming is the rapid spread of beech leaf disease from Ohio to Maine. 
A leaf-feeding weevil is spreading south in eastern Canada. We suggest 
that the subcommittee ask APHIS what steps it is taking to prevent its 
introduction to the U.S.
    'Ohi'a trees make up 80 percent of the biomass of forests across 
the Hawaiian archipelago. They are under attack by two introduced 
diseases first detected in 2010. How is APHIS helping to protect these 
forests-so important to biodiversity and other ecosystem services, 
including water supplies?
                          aphis funding levels
    To respond effectively to these pests and to the others that will 
be introduced in coming years, the key APHIS programs identified above 
must have adequate funds--even in this time of budgetary constraints. 
For this reason, we thank the Congress for increasing funding for 
APHIS' Tree and Wood Pests program to $64 million in fiscal year 2023 
and ask that you raise it to $65 million in FY2024.
    The Tree and Wood Pests account supports eradication and control 
efforts targeting principally the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) and 
spongy (formerly gypsy) moth. Eradicating the ALB normally receives 
about two-thirds of the funds. The programs in Massachusetts, New York, 
Ohio, and South Carolina must continue until eradication succeeds.
    Oregon detected the emerald ash borer (EAB) near Portland in 2022. 
More than 9,000 ash trees along Portland's streets and thousands more 
in parks will probably die. In wetlands of the Willamette Valley, ash 
constitutes almost 100 percent of the forest trees. Washington and 
California also face risks. Indeed, the Hudgins study identified 
Seattle and Takoma as likely to lose thousands of ash trees. The 
numerous ash in riparian forests, windbreaks, and towns of North Dakota 
are also at risk since EAB is established in South Dakota, Minnesota, 
and Manitoba. We suggest that the Committee ask APHIS what it has 
learned from the EAB program's failure and how it will apply that 
lesson to other programs.
    We have described failures of the Specialty Crops program to 
prevent spread of the sudden oak death pathogen through the interstate 
trade in nursery plants. We support the Administration's request for 
$222 million for this program. However, we ask that the Committee 
ensure that APHIS allots adequate funding under this budget line to 
management of sudden oak death, and such new invaders as rapid 'ohi'a 
death in Hawai`i, and beech leaf disease and elm zig-zag sawfly in the 
East.
    We support the Administration's request for the Pest Detection 
program. This program is key to the prompt detection of newly 
introduced pests that is critical to successful pest eradication or 
containment. However, we ask for a small increase for the ``Methods 
Development'' program, which enables APHIS to improve development of 
essential detection and eradication tools.
    We note that the current $1 million emergency fund is far below the 
level needed to respond when a new pest is discovered. Funding 
constraints have hampered APHIS' response to past pest incursions.

  Prepared Statement of the Colorado River Board of California (Board)
    This testimony is provided by the Colorado River Board of 
California (Board) and is in support of Fiscal-Year 2024 funding for 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) associated with those 
activities that assist in the implementation of Title II of the 
Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-320), 
as amended. This long-standing and cost-effective salinity control 
program in the Colorado River Basin is being carried out pursuant to 
the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act and the Clean Water Act 
(Public Law 92-500). Congress authorized the Colorado River Basin 
Salinity Control Program (Program) in 1974 to offset increased damages 
caused by continued development and use of the waters of the Colorado 
River. The USDA portion of the Program, as authorized by Congress and 
funded and administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service 
(NRCS) under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), is an 
essential part of the overall effort. A funding level of at least $12.2 
million in EQIP Financial Assistance (FA) is required annually to 
prevent further degradation of the quality of the Colorado River and 
increased downstream environmental and economic damages.
    The Board is the state agency charged with protecting California's 
interests and rights in the water and power resources of the Colorado 
River system. In this capacity, California participates along with the 
other six Colorado River Basin States in the Colorado River Basin 
Salinity Control Forum (Forum), the interstate organization responsible 
for coordinating the Basin States' salinity control efforts. In close 
cooperation with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and 
pursuant to requirements of the Clean Water Act, the Forum is charged 
with reviewing the Colorado River's water quality standards every 3 
years. The Forum adopts a Plan of Implementation consistent with these 
water quality standards. The level of appropriation being supported in 
this testimony is consistent with the Forum's 2020 Plan of 
Implementation. The Forum's 2020 Plan of Implementation can be found on 
this website: https://coloradoriversalinity.org/docs/
2020%20REVIEW%20Final percent20w percent20appendices.pdf. If adequate 
funds are not appropriated, significant damages associated with 
increasing salinity concentrations of Colorado River water would become 
more widespread in the United States and Mexico.
    The Program benefits both the Upper Basin water users through more 
efficient water management and Lower Basin water users through reduced 
salinity concentration of Colorado River water. The salinity of 
Colorado River waters increases from about 50 mg/L at its headwaters to 
more than 700 mg/L in the Lower Basin. There are very significant 
economic damages caused downstream by high salt levels in the water. 
There are also local benefits in the Upper Colorado River Basin from 
the Program in the form of soil and environmental benefits, improved 
agricultural production, improved water efficiencies, reduced 
fertilizer use and labor costs, and water distribution and 
infrastructure improvements. Local producers submit cost-effective 
applications under EQIP in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming and offer to 
cost-share in the acquisition of new irrigation equipment. The mix of 
funding under EQIP, cost-share from the Basin States and efforts and 
cost-share brought forward by local producers has created a most 
remarkable and successful partnership.
    At the urging of the States and directives from Congress, NRCS 
recognized that the Program is different than small watershed 
enhancement efforts common to EQIP. In the case of Colorado River 
salinity control efforts, the watershed being managed stretches more 
than 1,400 miles from the Colorado River's headwaters in the Rocky 
Mountains to the Colorado River's terminus in the Gulf of California in 
Mexico. Each year, NRCS State Conservationists in Colorado, Utah and 
Wyoming prepare a 3-year funding plan for the salinity control efforts 
under EQIP. The Board supports this funding plan which recognizes the 
need for $12.2 million in EQIP Financial Assistance (FA) allocations in 
fiscal Year 2024. Additionally, there is still a need for sufficient 
Technical Assistance (TA) dollars to adequately implement the Program.
    It has been over forty-nine years since the passage of the Colorado 
River Basin Salinity Control Act and much has been learned about the 
impact of salts in the Colorado River system. Currently, the salinity 
concentration of Colorado River water causes about $354 million in 
quantifiable damages in the United States annually. Economic and 
hydrologic modeling by Reclamation indicates that the quantifiable 
damages could rise to nearly $671 million by the year 2040 without the 
continuation of the Program. For example, damages can be incurred 
related to the following activities:

  --A reduction in the ability and increased costs to re-claim and 
        reuse water due to high salinities in the water delivered to 
        water treatment and reclamation facilities;
  --A reduction in the yield of salt sensitive crops and increased 
        water use to meet the leaching requirements in the agricultural 
        sector;

  --Increases in the volumes of imported water required;

  --Increased costs of desalination and brine disposal for recycling 
        water in the municipal and industrial sectors;

  --A reduction in the useful life of galvanized water pipe systems, 
        water heaters, faucets, garbage disposals, clothes washers, and 
        dishwashers, and increased use of bottled water and water 
        softeners in the household sector;

  --An increase in the cost of cooling operations and the cost of water 
        softening, and a decrease in equipment service life in the 
        commercial sectors;

  --An increase in the use of water and the cost of water treatment, 
        and an increase in sewer fees in the industrial sectors;

  --A decrease in the life of treatment facilities and pipelines in the 
        utility sectors;

  --Difficulty in meeting wastewater discharge requirements to comply 
        with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit 
        terms and conditions; and

  --An increase in desalination and brine disposal costs due to 
        accumulation of salts in groundwater basins.

    The Colorado River is, and will continue to be, a major and vital 
water resource to the nearly 20 million residents and 860,000 acres of 
irrigated agriculture within southern California, including municipal, 
industrial, and agricultural water users in Imperial, Los Angeles, 
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Ventura Counties. The 
protection and improvement of Colorado River water quality through the 
continuation and expansion of an effective salinity control program 
avoids additional economic and environmental damages to Mexico, 
California and the other States that rely on Colorado River water 
resources.
    Thank you for your consideration of this testimony.

Director, Colorado River Board of California.]
                                 ______
                                 
Prepared Statement of the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program
    Congress authorized the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control 
Program (Program) through the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act 
(Act) in 1974 to offset increased damages caused by continued 
development and use of the waters of the Colorado River. Congress has 
directed the Secretary of Agriculture to participate in the 
implementation of the Program. The USDA portion of the Program, as 
authorized by Congress and funded and administered by the Natural 
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) under the Environmental Quality 
Incentives Program (EQIP), is an essential part of the overall effort. 
A funding level of $12.2 Million in EQIP Financial Assistance (FA) in 
2024 is consistent with the Program's Plan of Implementation and is 
required to prevent further degradation of the quality of the Colorado 
River and commensurate increases in economic damages to water users.
    The Program is currently funded under NRCS's EQIP and under the 
Bureau of Reclamation's Basinwide Program. Recognizing that 
agricultural improvements are some of the most cost-effective 
strategies, Congress passed several Acts to authorize and fund the 
United States Departments of Agriculture and Interior to establish a 
voluntary, cooperative program with irrigators to improve water 
management and reduce watershed erosion:

  --1984 amendment of the Salinity Control Act

  --1996 Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act

  --2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (FSRIA)

  --2008 Food, Conservation and Energy Act (FCEA)

  --2018 Agricultural Improvement Act

    The Program, as set forth in the act, is to reduce salinity levels 
for the benefit of Lower Basin water users hundreds of miles downstream 
from the sources of salinity in the Upper Basin. EQIP is used to 
improve upstream irrigation efficiencies, which in turn reduces 
leaching of salts to the Colorado River. The Upper Colorado River Basin 
also benefits from the Program as it provides soil and environmental 
benefits, improved agricultural production, improved water 
efficiencies, lower fertilizer and labor costs, and water distribution 
and infrastructure improvements. EQIP also fosters good collaboration 
between farmers and ranchers, States, and the Federal Government in 
complying with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency mandated water 
quality standards. Local producers submit cost-effective applications 
under EQIP in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming and offer to cost share in the 
acquisition of new irrigation equipment. The mix of funding under EQIP, 
cost share from the Basin States and efforts brought forward by local 
agricultural producers has created a successful partnership.
    This Program is different from small watershed enhancement efforts 
common to EQIP. The watershed to be considered stretches more than 
1,400 miles from the Colorado River's headwaters in the Rocky Mountains 
to the Colorado River's terminus in the Gulf of California in Mexico. 
Each year the NRCS State Conservationists for Colorado, Utah and 
Wyoming prepare a 3-year funding plan for the salinity efforts under 
EQIP.
    The State of New Mexico supports this funding plan which recognizes 
the need for $12.2 M in EQIP FA allocations in fiscal Year 2024. 
Additionally, there is a need for sufficient EQIP Technical Assistance 
(TA) dollars to adequately implement the program. State and local cost 
sharing is triggered by the Federal appropriation. New Mexico 
appreciates the efforts of NRCS leadership and the support of this 
subcommittee in implementing the Program.
    Damages to water users in the United States and Mexico, caused by 
the concentration of salt in the Colorado River, include:

  --reduced ability to reclaim and reuse water for beneficial uses,

  --reduced yield of salt sensitive crops,

  --increased use of imported water and cost of desalination,

  --reduced useful life of galvanized water pipe systems and 
        appliances,

  --increased use of bottled water and water softeners,

  --increased cost of cooling operations and water softening,

  --increased cost of water treatment,

  --increased sewer fees,

  --decreased lifespan of treatment facilities and pipelines,

  --difficulty meeting wastewater discharge requirements to comply with 
        National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit 
        requirements,

    The State of New Mexico is a member of the Colorado River Basin 
Salinity Control Forum (Forum) which is composed of gubernatorial 
appointees from Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, 
Utah, and Wyoming. Every third year, the Forum adopts a Plan of 
Implementation consistent with efforts to facilitate compliance with 
the Clean Water Act. The level of appropriation requested in this 
testimony is in keeping with the adopted Plan of Implementation. If 
adequate funds are not appropriated, significant damages from higher 
salinity concentrations in the water will be more widespread in the 
United States and Mexico.
    NRCS personnel have developed a productive working relationship 
with farmers within the Colorado River Basin. Additionally, technical 
assistance is required for planning, design and implementation of 
future projects. Continued funding for the monitoring and evaluation of 
existing projects is essential to maintaining the salinity reduction 
already achieved.
    New Mexico stands in support of continuation of EQIP with adequate 
funding levels dedicated to the Program.

                                 ______
                                 
 Prepared Statement of the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Forum
    Waters from the Colorado River are used by approximately 40 million 
people for municipal and industrial purposes and used to irrigate 
approximately 5.5 million acres in the United States. Natural and 
human-induced salt loading to the Colorado River creates environmental 
and economic damages. In 2020 the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) 
estimated the quantifiable damages to Lower Basin water users due to 
elevated salinity levels at about $354 million per year (unquantifiable 
damages add to this amount). Congress authorized the Colorado River 
Basin Salinity Control Program (Program) through the Colorado River 
Basin Salinity Control Act (Act) (Public Law 93-320) in 1974 to offset 
increased damages caused by continued development and use of the waters 
of the Colorado River. Modeling by Reclamation indicates that the 
quantifiable damages will rise to approximately $671 million annually 
by the year 2040 without continuation of the Program. Congress has 
directed the Secretary of Agriculture to participate in the 
implementation of the Program. The USDA portion of the Program, as 
authorized by Congress and funded and administered by the Natural 
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) under the Environmental Quality 
Incentives Program (EQIP), is an essential part of the overall effort. 
A funding level of $12.2 M in EQIP Financial Assistance (FA) in 2024 is 
consistent with the Program's Plan of Implementation and is required to 
prevent further degradation of the quality of the Colorado River and 
commensurate increases in downstream economic damages to water users.
    In enacting the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act in 1974, 
Congress directed that the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control 
Program should be implemented in a cost-effective way. The Program is 
currently funded under EQIP through NRCS and under Reclamation's 
Basinwide Program. Recognizing that agricultural on-farm improvements 
are some of the most cost-effective strategies, Congress authorized the 
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a 
voluntary, cooperative program with irrigators to improve on-farm water 
management and reduce watershed erosion through amendment of the act in 
1984 (Public Law 98-569). With the enactment of the Federal Agriculture 
Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (FAIRA) (Public Law 104-127), 
Congress directed that the Program should continue to be implemented as 
part of the then newly created EQIP. Since the enactment of the Farm 
Security and Rural Investment Act (FSRIA) in 2002, and more recent EQIP 
funding levels, there have been, for the first time in a number of 
years, opportunities to adequately fund the Program within EQIP. In 
2008, Congress passed the Food, Conservation and Energy Act (FCEA) 
(Public Law 110-234). The FCEA amended the act to address the cost 
sharing requirement and established the Basin States Program (BSP). The 
BSP provides the mechanism for expenditure of 30 percent of the total 
amount spent each year by the combined EQIP and BSP effort. With the 
passage of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-
334), the authority for USDA to implement salinity control activities 
in the Colorado River Basin was continued.
    The Program, as set forth in the act, is to benefit Lower Basin 
water users hundreds of miles downstream from the sources of salinity 
in the Upper Basin. The salinity of Colorado River waters increases 
from about 50 mg/L at its headwaters to more than 700 mg/L in the Lower 
Basin. There are very significant economic damages caused downstream by 
high salt levels in the water. EQIP is used to improve upstream 
irrigation efficiencies, which in turn reduce leaching of salts to the 
Colorado River. There are also local benefits in the Upper Colorado 
River Basin from the Program in the form of soil and environmental 
benefits, improved agricultural production, improved water 
efficiencies, lower fertilizer and labor costs, and water distribution 
and infrastructure improvements. Also important is the collaboration 
that EQIP fosters between farmers and ranchers, States, and the Federal 
Government in complying with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
mandated water quality standards and the attainment of multi-benefit 
economic and sustainability goals. Local producers submit cost-
effective applications under EQIP in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming and 
offer to cost share in the acquisition of new irrigation equipment. The 
mix of funding under EQIP, cost share from the Basin States and efforts 
and cost share brought forward by local agricultural producers has 
created a most remarkable and successful partnership.
    After longstanding urgings from the States and directives from 
Congress, NRCS recognized that this Program is different from small 
watershed enhancement efforts common to EQIP. In the case of the 
Colorado River salinity control effort, the watershed to be considered 
stretches more than 1,400 miles from the Colorado River's headwaters in 
the Rocky Mountains to the Colorado River's terminus in the Gulf of 
California in Mexico. Each year the NRCS State Conservationists for 
Colorado, Utah and Wyoming prepare a 3-year funding plan for the 
salinity efforts under EQIP. The Colorado River Basin Salinity Control 
Forum (Forum) supports this funding plan which recognizes the need for 
$12.2 M in EQIP FA allocations in fiscal Year 2024. Additionally, there 
is a need for sufficient EQIP Technical Assistance (TA) dollars to 
adequately implement the program. State and local cost sharing is 
triggered by the Federal appropriation. The Forum appreciates the 
efforts of NRCS leadership and the support of this subcommittee in 
implementing the Program.
    Damages to water users in the United States and Mexico, caused by 
the concentration of salt in the Colorado River, by water usage sector, 
include the following:

  --a reduction in the ability to reclaim and reuse water for 
        beneficial uses, including drinking water and irrigation water 
        supplies, due to high salinities in the water delivered to 
        water treatment and reclamation facilities,

  --a reduction in the yield of salt sensitive crops, increased water 
        use to meet leaching requirements and additional actions 
        necessary to comply with the Clean Water Act within the 
        agricultural sector,

  --increased use of imported water and cost of desalination and brine 
        disposal for recycling water in the municipal sector,
  --a reduction in the useful life of galvanized water pipe systems, 
        water heaters, faucets, garbage disposals, clothes washers and 
        dishwashers, and increased use of bottled water and water 
        softeners in the household sector,

  --an increase in the cost of cooling operations and the cost of water 
        softening, and a decrease in equipment service life in the 
        commercial sector,

  --an increase in the use of water and the cost of water treatment, 
        and a corresponding increase in sewer fees in the industrial 
        sector,

  --a decrease in the lifespan of treatment facilities and pipelines in 
        the utility sector, and

  --difficulty in meeting wastewater discharge requirements to comply 
        with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit 
        terms and conditions, and an increase in desalination and brine 
        disposal costs necessary to minimize accumulation of salts in 
        groundwater basins.

    The Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Forum (Forum) is composed 
of gubernatorial appointees from Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, 
New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. The Forum is charged with reviewing the 
Colorado River's water quality standards for salinity every 3 years to 
facilitate compliance with Section 303(c) of the Clean Water Act 
(Public Law 92-500). In so doing, it adopts a Plan of Implementation 
consistent with these standards. The level of appropriation requested 
in this testimony is in keeping with the adopted Plan of 
Implementation. If adequate funds are not appropriated, significant 
damages from higher salinity concentrations in the water will be more 
widespread in the United States and Mexico.
    Over the years, NRCS personnel have developed a productive working 
relationship with farmers within the Colorado River Basin. Maintaining 
salinity control achieved by implementation of past practices requires 
continuing education and technical assistance from NRCS personnel. 
Additionally, technical assistance is required for planning, design and 
implementation of future projects. Lastly, the continued funding for 
the monitoring and evaluation of existing projects is essential to 
maintaining the salinity reduction already achieved.
    In summary, implementation of salinity control practices through 
EQIP has proven to be a very cost-effective method of controlling the 
salinity of the Colorado River and is an essential component to the 
overall Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program. Continuation of 
EQIP with adequate funding levels dedicated to the Program will prevent 
the water quality of the Colorado River from further degradation and 
significant increases in economic damages to municipal, industrial and 
irrigation users. A modest investment in source control pays huge 
dividends in improved water quality for nearly 40 million Americans.

         Prepared Statement of Entomological Society of America
    The Entomological Society of America (ESA) respectfully submits 
this statement for the official record in support of funding for 
agricultural research at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). ESA 
joins the research community and requests discretionary appropriations 
of at least $2.080 billion in fiscal year 2024 for USDA's National 
Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), including at least $500 
million for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI). The 
Society also supports a topline funding level of at least $1.95 billion 
for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) including robust funding 
for the ARS Crop Protection budget as well as funding to preserve 
valuable pest management research, invasive species programs, and 
pollinator health in fiscal Year 2022. Additionally, ESA supports at 
least $1.188 billion for Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) to carry out its mission of safeguarding domestic agriculture 
from foreign and invasive threats.
    ESA requests at least $2.080 billion in fiscal Year 2024 for USDA's 
NIFA. NIFA grants support research that aims to solve national 
challenges in agriculture, food, the environment, and communities. One 
example of important NIFA grants are those that support integrated pest 
management (IPM). IPM is the most sustainable long-term solution to 
pest problems, which are a constant threat to the agriculture in the 
United States. U.S. farmers lose approximately 10-35 percent of their 
crops to pests every year, and they spent $9 billion on pesticides 
(including insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides) in 2019 alone. IPM 
integrates multiple pest management tactics to protect crops. This 
integration of multiple strategies and technologies helps to minimize 
overuse of any one strategy, specifically pesticides, which reduces the 
risk of resistance development, secondary pest outbreaks, and other 
unintended consequences.
    NIFA supports several programs that fund IPM research, and IPM is 
most directly supported by the Federal Crop Protection and Pest 
Management grant program, which was established when several budget 
lines were consolidated in 2014. Funding for IPM took dramatic cuts in 
the amount of more than $63 million during that consolidation and has 
remained static for many years. Continued investment in IPM 
Infrastructure is vital for protecting U.S. agricultural production to 
safeguard U.S. agricultural industry and food supply.
    ESA requests at least $500 million for AFRI in fiscal Year 2024. As 
NIFA's premier competitive research program, AFRI funds a wide range of 
agricultural research, education, and extension projects at 
universities and research institutions nationwide. To maximize its 
resources, AFRI supports projects that address key societal challenges 
and build foundational knowledge in high-priority areas of the food and 
agricultural sciences. For example, with AFRI funding, scientists based 
at Iowa State University tested how small strips of prairie grasses 
could be integrated into corn and soybean fields in the Midwest to 
advance ecosystem services with minimal impacts on crop production.\1\ 
They found that the integration of prairie grass reduced nutrient 
runoff and soil erosion while increasing the abundance and diversity of 
bees, without significant loss in agricultural productivity. This work 
has been foundational across multiple disciplines, and the technique 
was included as a conservation practice supported by the Farm Bill in 
2018.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.8819440
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Another critical function of the AFRI program is to fund timely 
research on human nutrition. For example, AFRI supported a study at 
Virginia Polytechnic Institute focused on determining the protein 
content and structure of black soldier fly larvae as a potential 
alternative protein source.\2\ Continued funding of work like this can 
help clarify the potential role insects can play in food security for 
direct human consumption or for livestock feed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ESA supports at least $1.95 billion for ARS and maintaining strong 
funding levels for the Crop Protection and Crop Production accounts. As 
USDA's intramural research agency, ARS funds research with a direct 
impact on our Nation's agriculture enterprise, including in the areas 
of crop and livestock production and protection, human nutrition, food 
safety, and environmental stewardship. For example, the Brazilian 
peppertree is a highly invasive plant that obstructs restoration 
efforts in Everglades National Park.\3\ Recently, ARS scientists 
collaborated with the University of Florida and Florida Department of 
Food and Consumer Services to test the potential of Brazilian 
peppertree thrips, natural predators, as a cost-effective and 
environmentally friendly method to control these invasive trees and 
found that these insects are a viable solution.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ESA supports APHIS's mission to safeguard the Nation's agricultural 
enterprise and native ecosystems and requests support for APHIS in 
fiscal Year 2024 of at least $1.188 billion in discretionary funding, 
in line with the fiscal Year 2024 President's Budget Request. APHIS 
plays a critical role in protecting domestic soils from foreign threats 
in the form of invasive species. Invasive insect pests are some of the 
most costly and troublesome challenges faced by farmers, homeowners, 
and others, and APHIS is tasked with preventing their entry into the 
country, an increasingly challenging task considering increasing rates 
of trade, human movement, and climate change. Only a tiny fraction of 
cargo coming in through ports and planes are screened. While data-
driven methods for prioritizing shipment inspections based on 
statistical risk are improving the odds of intercepting invasive pests 
in international cargo, the capacity for international cooperation on 
pre-border, border, and post-border inspection and response must be 
expanded and improved. Furthermore, remote sensing could play a 
significant role in increasing early detection and rapid response 
(EDRR) to invasive pests, but it is virtually absent in insect pest 
management. APHIS would benefit from a program dedicated to EDRR for 
emerging threats. This would include an additional $25 million on top 
of the $75 million authorized in the 2018 Farm Bill for a program 
focused on responding to emerging invasive threats via EDRR at a high 
level, rather than a threat-specific line item, giving APHIS the 
flexibility and discretion to respond as new threats emerge.
    In addition to responding to new threats, ESA supports APHIS's 
continued research on known and destructive invasive pests including 
the khapra beetle, which poses a threat to global food security and 
which is not easily controlled with conventional techniques.\5\\6\ 
APHIS researchers identified a new attractant for use in traps for the 
monitoring and surveillance of the beetle, which led to the filing of a 
patent and an important public-private partnership to improve trapping 
and monitoring of the khapra beetle.\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ESA also supports increased funding for research on pollinator 
populations. Insects that play a role in pollination are vital to our 
Nation's agriculture industry. Honeybees alone pollinate more than 100 
crops in the U.S. and are essential to produce an estimated one-third 
of all the food we eat or export. To ensure a healthy pollinator 
population, more research is needed to examine the diverse factors that 
endanger their health. ESA appreciates the establishment of the 
Honeybee and Pollinator Research Coordinator position in the 2018 Farm 
Bill. To this end, ESA supports USDA's coordination of multi-agency 
activities through the Office of the Chief Scientist to further 
investigate pollinator health and develop implementation plans to 
prevent pollinator population decline.
    ESA, headquartered in Annapolis, MD, is the largest organization in 
the world serving the professional and scientific needs of 
entomologists and individuals in related disciplines. Founded in 1889, 
ESA is a non-partisan professional organization with over 7,000 members 
affiliated with educational institutions, health agencies, private 
industry, and government. Members are researchers, teachers, extension 
service personnel, administrators, marketing representatives, research

     Prepared Statement of Environmental and Energy Study Institute
    Thank you for the opportunity to submit written testimony for the 
record in support of programs under the subcommittee's jurisdiction 
that support climate change mitigation and adaptation. Specifically, 
our testimony highlights the need for at least $26 million for the 
Rural Energy Savings Program (RESP) in Fiscal Year 2024.
    The Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) is a non-profit 
organization founded in 1984 on a bipartisan basis by members of 
Congress to help educate and inform policymakers, their staff, 
stakeholders, and the American public about the benefits of a low-
emissions economy that prioritizes energy efficiency, renewable energy, 
and new clean energy technologies.\1\ In 1988, EESI declared that 
addressing climate change is a moral imperative, and that has since 
guided our work. More recently, we have also developed a program to 
provide technical assistance to rural utilities interested in on-bill 
financing programs for energy efficiency, renewable energy and storage, 
and beneficial electrification for their customers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ About Us, https://www.eesi.org/about.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    RESP, administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
Rural Utilities Service (RUS), was first authorized in the 2014 Farm 
Bill.\2\ RESP provides zero-interest loans to electric cooperatives, 
state financing entities, green banks, and others to establish or 
expand residential and small business energy efficiency improvement 
programs. These programs offer rural households and small businesses 
no- or low-cost financing for cost-effective energy efficiency, 
renewable energy, and electrification improvements. These improvements 
are made at no upfront cost and repaid over time via a utility bill 
line-item.\3\ On average, these improvements cost between $5,000 to 
$15,000-an investment otherwise out of reach for many Americans, 
particularly in rural areas where families pay on average 40 percent 
more of their income for energy compared to their urban counterparts.

services/electric-programs/rural-energy-savings-program.
    \3\ On-Bill Financing Project, https://www.eesi.org/obf/main.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    RESP loans are leveraged, so each dollar of Federal appropriations 
facilitates zero-interest loans worth much more. But higher interest 
rates mean the credit subsidy mechanism used by RUS results in less 
leverage than before. An increase in appropriations in FY2024 is 
necessary to keep RESP at a constant level of lending authority, which 
also sends a message of certainty and confidence to prospective 
borrowers.
    The demand for RESP loans remains strong. RUS has awarded almost 
$290 million in RESP loans.\4\ USDA plays a key role in efforts to help 
drive economic growth and create jobs in rural communities, and robust 
funding for RESP in FY2024 is critical to ensure low-income families 
can enjoy the benefits of energy efficiency and clean energy 
improvements.

    \4\ Rural Investments in Program Areas, https://www.rd.usda.gov/
rural-data-gateway/rural-investments/program-areas.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The benefits of RESP are wide-ranging. For many families and small 
businesses that ultimately receive the funds, they immediately realize 
lower energy bills from insulation, air sealing, and new heating and 
cooling equipment. Some RESP-funded programs also finance distributed 
renewable energy generation, energy storage, electric vehicle supply 
equipment, irrigation improvements, and more-provided that improvements 
can be shown to be cost-effective to the end user.
    These investments all have the added benefits of resource 
conservation and, by lowering consumption and replacing fossil fuel 
with renewable sources to generate electricity, greenhouse gas 
emissions reductions. RESP also helps finance the last stretch of 
broadband infrastructure from the main line, which increases the number 
of households able to benefit from smart thermostats and other grid-
enabled devices. Many RESP-funded programs are designed so financing 
for cost-effective improvements is accessible to all end-users 
regardless of income or credit, which helps provide a more equitable 
distribution of benefits.
    Moreover, when implementing RESP programs, electric cooperatives 
and other eligible entities support local jobs implementing these 
improvements. The energy efficiency sector by itself accounted for 
about 2.2 million jobs in 2021, according to the U.S. Energy and 
Employment Report.\5\ Clean energy businesses contribute to local 
economic development and provide workers with new training 
opportunities, which are often too few in rural communities that 
disproportionately suffer from persistent poverty and high energy 
burdens.

            Prepared Statement of Food Industry Association
    FMI--The Food Industry Association works with and on behalf of the 
entire food industry to advance a safer, healthier, and more efficient 
consumer food supply chain. FMI brings together a wide range of members 
across the value chain--from retailers who sell to consumers, to 
producers who supply the food, as well as the wide variety of companies 
providing critical services--to amplify the collective work of the 
industry. The reach and impact of our industry is extensive, ultimately 
touching the lives of over 100 million households in the United States 
and representing an $800 billion industry with nearly 6 million 
employees.
    In one of the final rulemaking actions to implement a relatively 
narrow provision of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) passed by 
Congress, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an incredibly 
complex final rule--the Food Traceability Rule--in November 2022, more 
than 10 years after FSMA passage (signed into Public Law on January 4, 
2011). The legislation contained a much simpler and streamlined 
provision targeting a small number of ``high-risk'' foods. However, the 
rulemaking is 596 pages in length and the justification for determining 
which foods are designated as ``high-risk'' is over 100 pages in 
length- certainly challenging for any small business to confront and 
attempt to comply with. While the list of foods FDA determined should 
be included in this high-risk category, and thus subject to a 2-year 
recordkeeping requirement, is not yet defined at the food product 
level, the food and ingredient categories determined by an algorithm 
include foods like cream cheese that should never be on a high-risk 
list.
    This action by FDA followed the publication of a proposed rule in 
2021 seeking comments from stakeholders. FMI, along with other industry 
stakeholders, submitted substantial comments outlining concerns with 
the scope and magnitude of the proposed rule, along with the 
unrealistic product level tracking provisions and lengthy record 
keeping requirements being proposed. FMI also asked FDA to publish a 
supplemental rule (as was done with most other FDA rules to implement 
provisions of the Food Safety Modernization Act), yet FDA moved forward 
with the final rule.
    Ultimately, FDA made very few modifications or changes from the 
proposed rule to address the concerns raised by FMI and other industry 
stakeholders. While the traceability rule was intended to focus on only 
``high risk'' foods as authorized by a very narrow provision of the 
FSMA law, FDA has morphed this provision into an expansive ``food 
traceability list'' that now includes more than two dozen categories of 
foods and food ingredients. Thus, the list of food products subject to 
this new traceability requirement will number in the tens of thousands, 
and even FDA hasn't been able to establish a comprehensive list of 
products they expect to be traced.
    The original intent of the legislative provision was to target 
truly ``high risk'' food products that have experienced challenging 
food safety concerns and product recalls. The result of this final rule 
is to burden the entire food supply chain with an unworkable product 
tracing requirement, where no current technology is in practice to 
accomplish this. Furthermore, the rule will produce massive amounts of 
records that our industry members will have to maintain for 2 years, 
and that FDA likely cannot even effectively utilize in a timely manner.
    This rule is entirely reactive rather than focusing on proactive, 
preventative food safety measures, which is the focus of the food 
industry and should be FDA's focus. This rule will bring significant 
costs to the entire U.S. food supply and delivery system and does not 
include a single ingredient contained in the infant formula recall that 
demanded so many FDA and industry resources and caused so many consumer 
challenges this past year.
    As a result of these issues and concerns surrounding the final Food 
Traceability rule, FMI is requesting the subcommittee's consideration 
of bill and report language in the fiscal Year `24 Agriculture 
Appropriations bill to require FDA to take additional actions and steps 
before implementing or enforcing compliance with the final, 596-page 
rule. The proposed language below is needed to require FDA to identify 
what technology can feasibly be used by industry to meet the 
requirements of the rule, and to develop the complete list of the 
thousands of products they intend to be traced. Until FDA can take 
these steps, the Agency should not be allowed to implement or enforce 
the Food Traceability rule.
    The requested bill language and report language are outlined below.

    Proposed Bill Language:

                No funds appropriated by this act may be used to 
                implement, administer, or enforce the requirements of 
                the Final Rule ``Requirements for Additional 
                Traceability Records for Certain Foods'' (21 CFR Part 1 
                Subpart S) until the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
                provides a comprehensive, electronically downloadable 
                list of each food product subject to the rule; and 
                submits a report to this Committee identifying the low-
                cost technology available to maintain lot code 
                information for foods subject to the rule.

    Proposed Report Language:

                The Committee directs the Food and Drug Administration, 
                before implementing or enforcing the compliance 
                requirements of the Final Rule ``Requirements for 
                Additional Traceability Records for Certain Foods'' (21 
                CFR Part 1 Subpart S) to: develop a comprehensive, 
                electronically downloadable list of each food product 
                subject to the rule; submit a report to this Committee 
                identifying the low-cost technology solutions currently 
                available to maintain lot code information for foods 
                subject to the rule; and publish a protocol detailing 
                consistent investigation practices the Agency will use 
                to respond to food borne illness and outbreak 
                investigations.

    On behalf of FMI, we appreciate your consideration of this 
important request for our industry members. Please let us know what 
additional information we can provide that would be helpful and any 
questions we can answer. We look forward to working with you and your 
colleagues on this and other important priorities for the U.S. food and 
agriculture industry.

Thank you,

                      Prepared Statement of Haleon
    Haleon appreciates the opportunity to submit written testimony to 
the Senate Committee on Appropriations subcommittee on Agriculture, 
Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies. 
Haleon is a world-leading consumer health company with a clear purpose 
to deliver better everyday health with humanity. Haleon is committed to 
developing over-the-counter solutions to assist those who seek to 
decrease or end their tobacco use. We respectfully request the 
subcommittee to support innovation in new tobacco cessation products 
through the inclusion of the report language provided below.
    Smoking and other forms of tobacco use continue to be major risks 
to public health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of 
preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States, 
accounting for more than 480,000 deaths every year, or about 1 in 5 
deaths. In 2020, nearly 13 of every 100 U.S. adults aged 18 years or 
older (12.5 percent) currently smoked cigarettes. This means an 
estimated 30.8 million adults in the United States currently smoke 
cigarettes. More than 16 million Americans live with a smoking-related 
disease. Although cigarette smoking has declined significantly since 
1964, disparities in tobacco use remain across race, ethnicity, 
educational level, and socioeconomic status. In addition, the most 
recent Annual National Youth Tobacco Survey raises significant concerns 
that 14.1 percent (2.14 million) of high school students and 3.3 
percent (380,000) of middle school students reported current e-
cigarette use.
    Given the inherent health risks from smoking and vaping, there is a 
need to promote and improve cessation among adults and adolescents. 
Fortunately, there are proven tools and methods for decreasing tobacco 
use, including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and counseling. 
Studies have shown that combining these two strategies is the best way 
to quit. Haleon is supportive of all efforts to reduce and prevent 
tobacco consumption and decrease dependence on nicotine.
    Haleon maintains a steadfast commitment to provide safe and 
effective over-the-counter (OTC) solutions for consumers looking to 
live a healthier life. Millions of Americans rely on safe and effective 
NRT products, which can come in forms like lozenges, patches, gum, and 
inhalers. We are working to expand access to these products, including 
through State quitlines; many of which can provide NRT products for 
free.
    Haleon recognizes the public health imperative for innovation in 
bringing new tobacco cessation products to market; however, we have 
concerns that the Food and Drug Administration's approach to OTC NRT 
products is hindering, rather than facilitating, their development and 
approval. We continue to develop--and are seeking to bring to the U.S. 
market--other options.
    We respectfully request the subcommittee to include the following 
report language for the Food and Drug Administration regarding NRT 
products in the FY2024 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
Administration, and Related Agencies spending bill:
    Ensuring Innovation to combat youth smoking trends.-The Committee 
appreciates the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s efforts to combat 
youth smoking. The Committee, however, is alarmed by the findings from 
the most recent Annual National Youth Tobacco Survey, which indicate 
that 14.1 percent (2.14 million) of high school students and 3.3 
percent (380,000) of middle school students reported current e-
cigarette use. The same study also found that nearly 85 percent of 
current users preferred flavored e-cigarettes, with fruit flavors being 
the most popular, followed by candy, desserts, or other sweets. Given 
these concerning findings, coupled with the ongoing morbidity and 
mortality burden caused by tobacco use, the Committee directs the FDA, 
no later than March 2024, to report to the Committee on agency efforts 
undertaken within the last five calendar years to facilitate the 
development of new consumer-oriented smoking cessation products to help 
reduce tobacco and e-cigarette use. Further, the FDA is directed to 
convene the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee, the 
Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee, and the Tobacco Products 
Scientific Advisory Committee to discuss ways to expand over-the-
counter and prescription options for tobacco cessation.
    Haleon believes additional safe and effective over-the-counter NRT 
offerings are critical to help millions of Americans quit the harmful 
and costly impact of tobacco and nicotine use. We urge Congress and the 
FDA to make progress in the Nation's battle against the leading cause 
of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States. We 
thank you for the opportunity to submit written testimony for the 
record.

 Prepared Statement of the Humane Society Legislative Fund and Humane 
                                Society
      fda/reducing animal testing and advancing nonanimal methods
    We request no less than the fiscal Year 2023 level of $5 million 
for the New Alternative Methods Program and report language: ``The 
Committee directs FDA to efficiently and expeditiously utilize existing 
funds to reduce animal testing and advance alternative nonanimal 
methods in a measurable and impactful way. The agency is further 
directed to provide a report to the Committee within 90 days of 
enactment that provides details on the status of forming the New 
Alternative Methods Program in the Commissioner's office, including but 
not limited to a description of program goals and staffing levels by 
position classification; FDA's priority areas for reducing animal use 
and advancing nonanimal alternatives, including goals, timelines and 
funding associated with each of these identified priorities; the 
metrics the agency will use to measure impact; and how the agency will 
communicate information regarding acceptance of nonanimal alternative 
methods to the regulated community. The agency should not use funding 
to carry out new animal testing, including to evaluate the predictive 
capacity of the nonanimal alternative methods, but instead use human 
data or existing animal data. The Committee is also aware that the 
regulated community lacks certainty as to when nonanimal methods will 
be accepted in lieu of animal testing for safety and efficacy testing, 
which serves as a barrier to implementation of such alternative methods 
in the industry. To combat this, the Committee directs FDA to clarify 
the acceptance of new approach methodologies (NAMs) in its regulations 
and related guidance documents where appropriate, communicate up-to-
date information about NAMs acceptance on the agency's website, remove 
outdated guidance, and proactively communicate with stakeholders on 
NAMs acceptance for regulatory use. Along with these updates, the 
Committee directs FDA to prioritize and incentivize the development, 
use and regulatory acceptance of NAMs.''
    We seek to ensure FDA's judicious and impactful use of funding to 
reduce animal testing and advance alternative methods, and request 
details related to these efforts. Non-animal approaches include cell 
cultures, computer modeling, and other methods that are often faster, 
cheaper and more predictive of human health than animal tests. In FY23 
Congress directed FDA to report on its progress regarding reliability, 
reproducibility and development related to new alternative methods and 
the evaluation of the methods with which FDA is involved. FDA 
regulations and guidance documents acknowledge that FDA has the 
authority and flexibility to accept NAMs for safety and efficacy 
testing but in some areas emphasize animal testing that suggests it is 
mandatory for all new drug applications. This lack of clarity and 
internal consistency serves as a barrier to the adoption and use of 
NAMs. The FDA should clarify the acceptance of NAMs in the appropriate 
regulations and related guidance documents, communicate up-to-date 
information about NAMs acceptance on the agency's website, remove 
outdated guidance, and proactively communicate with stakeholders on 
NAMs acceptance for regulatory use.
                          fsis/horse slaughter
    We request bill language permanently barring USDA from expenditure 
of funds for horse slaughter inspections: ``None of the funds made 
available by this or any other act in this or any fiscal year 
hereafter, may be used to pay the salaries or expenses of any person or 
personnel- (1) to inspect horses under section 3 of the Federal Meat 
Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 603); (2) to inspect horses under section 903 
of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 
1901 note; Public Law 104-127); or (3) to implement or enforce section 
352.19 of title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, or any other regulation 
concerning the inspection of slaughter horses.''
    This provision is vital to prevent renewed horse slaughter activity 
in this country and wasting tax dollars on a practice that 83 percent 
of the American public opposes as inherently cruel and posing serious 
public health risks.
  office of the secretary/cage-free and crate-free housing conversion
    We request report language: ``The cage-free egg and gestation 
crate-free pork market continues to expand due to demand by consumers 
and food corporations as well as state laws requiring in-state farmers 
to convert to cage-free or gestation crate-free facilities. Producers 
may increase their long-term income when they are able to convert to 
cage-free and crate-free facilities to better meet these demands. The 
Committee directs the Secretary to continue helping egg and pork 
farmers address the economic opportunities associated with cage-free 
and gestation crate-free housing. In order to meet the needs of this 
effort, the Secretary is encouraged to submit a reprogramming of 
funding to the Committee.''
    Due to an increase in consumer awareness surrounding animal welfare 
and food safety concerns in our agricultural systems, more than 200 
companies are demanding a 100 percent cage-free egg supply including 
McDonald's, Walmart, Kroger, Denny's, and IHOP. Eleven States have 
passed laws banning cages for egg laying hens, and eight of those 
States require that eggs sold within their state borders are cage-free. 
There is also surging demand from major pork buyers like Kroger, 
Target, Burger King, Costco, and dozens of others for pork produced 
without the use of gestation crates that keep sows in space so tight 
they cannot turn around. Ten States have laws banning or restricting 
the use of gestation crates. Some producers, however, have been 
hesitant to make the switch to cage-free and crate-free systems because 
of the initial costs to convert to these systems. USDA data shows that 
more than 100 million hens are cage-free (36 percent of the U.S. egg 
flock), and according to the National Pork Producers Council, 38 
percent of sows are raised in groups at least part of their pregnancy. 
Federal support on the upfront conversion costs would help producers 
make the shift, bolstering animal welfare and helping the egg and pork 
industries take advantage of the expanding cage-free and crate-free 
market. In addition to humane concerns, this is a food safety issue 
because studies have shown that cage egg operations are significantly 
more likely to harbor Salmonella than cage-free facilities. Meanwhile, 
leading food safety groups have identified serious concerns about pork 
from facilities that confine breeding sows in gestation crates.
               aphis/animal welfare act (awa) enforcement
    We request bill language: ``The Secretary shall ensure that 
appropriate enforcement action in the form of penalties or case 
referral to the Office of General Counsel or the Department of Justice 
or both is taken when a regulated facility violates the Animal Welfare 
Act (7 U.S.C. 2131-2159) as documented on an inspection report, with 
due consideration to the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to 
the size of the business of the person involved, the gravity of the 
violation, the person's good faith, and the history of previous 
violations, as provided in 7 U.S.C. Section 2149(b). The Secretary 
shall ensure that any interference with or failure to allow access for 
an inspection under the Animal Welfare Act, 7 U.S.C. Sections 2131-
2159, is documented on an inspection report. The Secretary shall ensure 
that all dealers selling dogs, cats, and other covered animals online 
have the necessary license pursuant to Animal Welfare Act, 7 U.S.C. 
Sections 2131-2159, as required under 78 Fed. Reg. 57227. The Secretary 
of Agriculture shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with the 
U.S. Attorney General to encourage greater collaboration on Animal 
Welfare Act enforcement and ensure that the Department of Justice has 
access to evidence needed to initiate cases.''
    Report language: ``Case Referrals for Animal Welfare Act (AWA) 
Violations.-The Committee is concerned that USDA is not fully utilizing 
its enforcement capabilities, particularly for chronic violators of the 
AWA. There has been an overall decline in AWA enforcement since 2010 
when USDA initiated 874 cases and 74 stipulated penalties. By 2021, 
enforcement dropped to 262 initiated cases of which 18 resulted in 
settlements and 17 with administrative orders. The Committee directs 
USDA to use its full enforcement capabilities under the AWA including 
referring cases to the Office of General Counsel, the Department of 
Justice or both, when appropriate according to the factors the agency 
must consider under 7 U.S.C. Section 2149(b).''
    USDA is responsible for ensuring compliance with AWA standards at 
16,853 sites currently, including commercial breeding facilities, 
laboratories, zoos, circuses, and airlines. We are concerned with the 
agency's inadequate enforcement in recent years. In fiscal Year 2022, 
USDA initiated 262 cases against AWA licensees, resulting in 204 
warnings, 18 settlements, and 17 administrative orders. Seven licenses 
were suspended or revoked. While this was more than the previous 5 
years, overall there has been a decline in AWA enforcement since 2010, 
when USDA initiated 874 cases, with 74 stipulated penalties. APHIS 
should improve enforcement activity, especially by initiating more 
significant penalties, and work more with local law enforcement and the 
Department of Justice.
              aphis/horse protection act (hpa) enforcement
    We request no less than $4,096,000 (FY 2023 level) in the bill and 
report language: ``The Committee provides $4,096,000 for enforcement of 
the Horse Protection Act of 1970, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1831), and 
reminds the Secretary that Congress granted the agency primary 
responsibility to enforce this law, including the training of all 
inspectors. The Committee urges the Secretary to issue the new proposed 
HPA rule expeditiously, consistent with the agency's announced 
intentions in December 2021, and to finalize and publish the new final 
rule by December 31, 2023. The Committee further urges the Secretary to 
ensure that the new rule includes at a minimum all the key elements of 
the final rule, ``Horse Protection; Licensing of Designated Qualified 
Persons and Other Amendments'' [Docket No. APHIS-2011-0009], that was 
finalized and displayed in advance public notice in the Federal 
Register on January 19, 2017.''
      aphis/protecting animals with shelter (paws) implementation
    We request $3,000,000 in the bill for PAWS grants and report 
language: ``The Committee directs the Secretary of Agriculture to 
continue coordinating with the Departments of Justice, Housing and 
Urban Development, and Health and Human Services to efficiently 
implement the grant program for providing emergency and transitional 
shelter options for domestic violence survivors with companion 
animals.''
        fsis/humane methods of slaughter act (hmsa) enforcement
    We request language to strengthen HMSA enforcement. Bill: ``No 
fewer than 165 full-time equivalent positions shall be employed during 
fiscal year 2024 for purposes dedicated solely to inspections and 
enforcement related to the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. This number 
is in addition to the Humane Handling Enforcement Coordinator and 
District Veterinary Medical Specialist positions.'' Report: ``FSIS 
shall ensure that all inspection personnel conducting humane handling 
verification procedures receive robust initial training and periodic 
refresher training on the FSIS humane handling and slaughter 
regulations and directives. This includes handling of non-ambulatory 
disabled animals, as well as proper use of the Humane Activities 
Tracking System to ensure humane handling of animals as they arrive and 
are offloaded and handled in ante-mortem holding pens, suspect pens, 
chutes, stunning areas, and on the processing line. The Committee 
directs the agency to continue preparation and online publication of 
the Humane Handling Quarterly Reports, to include: (1) the number of 
humane handling verification procedures performed, (2) the number of 
administrative enforcement actions taken, (3) time spent on Humane 
Handling Activities Tracking System activities, and (4) comparisons of 
these measurements by plant size and FSIS district. The Committee 
recognizes that the humane handling of birds at slaughter according to 
Good Commercial Practices (GCPs) reduces the occurrence of adulterated 
poultry products in the marketplace and can improve the treatment of 
birds at slaughter. The Committee awaits the Department's briefing 
requested in the fiscal year 2022 and 2023 reports on documented 
instances where establishments lost control of their processes for 
handling birds, and consequently were not operating in accordance with 
GCPs. Further, the Committee directs the USDA to track the number of 
inspector hours spent on GCP verification activities intended to reduce 
instances of adulteration using its existing Humane Activities Tracking 
System or other appropriate method.''
                    oig/animal fighting enforcement
    We request report language: ``The Committee is concerned about 
illegal animal fighting activity that subjects animals to cruel 
conditions and has the potential to spread illnesses such as virulent 
Newcastle disease and avian flu. The OIG is encouraged to increase its 
efforts to pursue animal fighting cases even if related concerns, such 
as money laundering and illegal weapons, have not yet been determined 
to be at issue before an investigation is opened. OIG is also 
encouraged to work with USPS and DOJ to examine the prevalence of the 
illegal shipment of game-fowl used in cockfighting. The Committee also 
encourages the OIG to audit and investigate USDA enforcement of the 
Animal Welfare Act and the Horse Protection Act to help improve 
compliance with these important laws. This should include finalizing 
the reopening of the audit on the Animal Care Program Oversight of Dog 
Breeders to allow completion of in-person visits. Additionally, the 
Committee is concerned about the lack of meaningful enforcement of the 
AWA and HPA and requests that these audits should also examine what 
barriers exist to full enforcement of both Acts, and what if any steps 
can be taken within APHIS' Animal Care and Investigative and 
Enforcement Services programs to ensure that the regulated community is 
held accountable for violations of these Acts.''
             nifa/national veterinary medical services act
    We request $10,500,000 for the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment 
Program (Public Law 108-161).
         aphis/emergency preparedness and response/animal care
    We request $1,450,000 for Animal Care to assist in addressing 
animal issues in disasters.
    We appreciate the Committee's prior support of animal welfare 
issues, and hope you are able to accommodate these requests to better 
address the critical issues that impact millions of animals.

Affairs, Humane Society Legislative Fund.]
                                 ______
                                 
       Prepared Statement of Humane Society of the United States
    On behalf of the undersigned horse industry, veterinary, and animal 
welfare organizations, we submit the following testimony seeking 
funding of not less than $4,096,000 and language for the USDA/APHIS 
Horse Protection Program, for fiscal Year 2024. We appreciate that 
Congress provided $4,096,000 in fiscal Year 2023 for USDA to strengthen 
enforcement of the Horse Protection Act. An FY24 appropriation of no 
less than that amount is urgently needed as we seek to fulfill the 
intent of the Horse Protection Act--to eliminate the cruel practice of 
soring--by allowing the USDA to further strengthen its enforcement 
capabilities for this law.
    We urge you to include the following report language: ``The 
Committee provides $4,096,000 for enforcement of the Horse Protection 
Act of 1970, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1831), and reminds the Secretary 
that Congress granted the agency primary responsibility to enforce this 
law, including the training of all inspectors. The Committee urges the 
Secretary to issue the new proposed HPA rule expeditiously, consistent 
with the agency's announced intentions in December 2021, and to 
finalize and publish the new final rule by December 31, 2023. The 
Committee further urges the Secretary to ensure that the new rule 
includes at a minimum all the key elements of the final rule, ``Horse 
Protection; Licensing of Designated Qualified Persons and Other 
Amendments'' [Docket No. APHIS-2011-0009], that was finalized and 
displayed in advance public notice in the Federal Register on January 
19, 2017.''
    In January 2017, the USDA announced final regulations to eliminate 
industry self-policing and institute other reforms needed to end 
soring. These rules (Docket No. APHIS-2011-0009) received over 100,000 
public comments in support, including bipartisan letters signed by 182 
Representatives and 42 Senators. Unfortunately, the regulations were 
withdrawn soon after.
    In January 2021, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, 
and Medicine (NASEM) issued a report that criticized the industry self-
policing system, urging that only veterinarians be allowed to inspect 
the horses and making recommendations consistent with the 2017 
regulations. The report called for greater use of technologies such as 
thermography, prohibited substance testing, and blood testing, as well 
as urging that only veterinarians be allowed to inspect the horses. 
These recommendations depend on adequate agency resources. With current 
funding, Animal Care was only able to attend approximately 18 percent 
of the 229 HPA events held in fiscal Year 2022.
    In December 2021, the USDA announced plans to propose a new and 
improved HPA rule to take into account the NASEM findings. We were 
pleased that the agency stated its intention to issue the new rule 
expeditiously and identified this as a top regulatory priority.
    More than 50 years ago, Congress passed the Horse Protection Act in 
1970 to end soring, the intentional infliction of pain on the hooves 
and legs of a horse to produce an exaggerated gait in the ``Big Lick'' 
segment of the Tennessee Walking Horse show industry. Caustic 
chemicals--such as mustard oil, diesel fuel, and kerosene--are painted 
on the horse's lower front legs. Then the legs are wrapped for days in 
plastic wrap and bandages to ``cook'' the chemicals deep into the 
flesh, making the horse's legs extremely painful and sensitive. When 
ridden, the horse is fitted with chains that slide up and down the sore 
legs, forcing the animal to produce an exaggerated, high-stepping gait 
in the show ring. Additional tactics include inserting foreign objects 
such as hard acrylic between a heavy stacked shoe and the horse's hoof; 
pressure shoeing--cutting a horse's hoof down to the sensitive live 
tissue to cause extreme pain every time the horse bears weight on the 
hoof; and applying painful chemicals such as salicylic acid to slough 
off scarred tissue or numbing agents, in an attempt to obscure evidence 
of soring.
    The Horse Protection Act authorizes the USDA to inspect horses, 
including the three specific breeds known to be involved in soring--
Tennessee Walking, Racking, and Spotted Saddle Horses--in transport to 
and at shows, exhibits, auctions and sales--for signs of soring, and to 
pursue penalties against violators. Unfortunately, since its inception, 
enforcement has been plagued by underfunding. As a result, the USDA has 
never been able to adequately enforce the act, allowing this extreme 
and deliberate cruelty to persist on a widespread basis.
    To eliminate soring and meet the goals of the act, USDA officials 
must be present at more shows. Years ago, the Agency set up the 
industry-run system of certified HIO inspection programs, which are 
charged with inspecting horses for signs of soring at the majority of 
shows. These groups license examiners known as Designated Qualified 
Persons (DQPs) to conduct inspections. Several of these organizations 
hire industry insiders who have an obvious stake in preserving the 
status quo. Statistics clearly show that when USDA inspectors are in 
attendance to oversee shows affiliated with these organizations, the 
numbers of noted violations are many times higher than at shows where 
industry inspectors alone are conducting the inspections. By all 
measures, the overall DQP program as a whole has been a failure--the 
only remedy is to abolish the conflicted industry-run inspection 
programs charged with self-regulation and have USDA oversee a 
legitimate inspection program.
    USDA appeared to have attempted to step up its enforcement efforts 
some years ago, and had begun to work with the Department of Justice in 
prosecuting criminal cases as provided for under the act. In 2011, a 
Federal prosecutor sought the first-ever criminal indictments under the 
act and as a result, a well-known, winning trainer in the Spotted 
Saddle Horse industry served a prison sentence of over 1 year. A former 
Walking Horse Trainers' Association Trainer of the Year and winner of 
the Tennessee Walking Horse World Grand Championship, Jackie McConnell, 
was indicted in 2012 on 52 counts (18 of them felony) of violating the 
act and pleaded guilty to felony conspiracy to violate the act. He was 
sentenced to 3 years of probation and a $75,000 fine in Federal court. 
In 2013, another Tennessee trainer, Larry Wheelon, and three of his 
employees were indicted on 19 counts of aggravated animal cruelty 
charges under state law in a case flowing from a USDA Office of 
Inspector General investigation. While Wheelon's case was dismissed on 
a technicality, evidence of soring in his barn was plentiful and 
horrifying.
    These were significant actions that should have had a deterrent 
effect, but there are many other violators who go undetected and many 
cases that go unprosecuted due to a lack of resources USDA needs to 
carry out its responsibilities under this act as Congress and the 
public expect. In years past, Agency inspections were limited to 
physical observation and palpation by the inspector. Protocols for the 
use of new technologies, such as chemical analysis of prohibited 
foreign substances used by violators on the legs of horses (either to 
sore them, or to mask underlying soring and evade detection by 
inspectors) have been implemented, which can help inspectors identify 
violations more effectively. The results of USDA's testing for 
prohibited foreign substances are staggering: 46 of the 66 random 
samples (70 percent) taken by the USDA (in 2019, the last year for 
which the agency has made this data available) at the industry's 
pinnacle event--the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration--
tested positive for illegal foreign substances including soring, 
masking, and numbing agents.
    Effective though this inspection protocol may be, due to budget 
constraints, USDA has been unable to put enough of this testing into 
use in the field, allowing industry players to continually evade 
detection. In 2019, USDA collected and tested only 268 samples at only 
8 of the largest Big Lick shows; in 2018, 260 samples at only 20 shows; 
and in 2017, 316 samples at only 14 shows. With increased funding, the 
USDA could purchase more equipment and dispatch more inspectors to use 
it, greatly increasing the agency's ability to enforce the HPA.
    Currently, when USDA inspectors arrive at shows affiliated with 
some industry organizations, many exhibitors leave to avoid being 
caught with sored horses. While USDA could stop these trailers, Agency 
officials have stated that inspectors are wary of going outside of 
their designated inspection area, for fear of harassment and physical 
violence from exhibitors. Armed security is frequently utilized in the 
designated area to allow such inspections, at additional expense to 
this program. That exhibitors feel they can intimidate government 
officials without penalty is a testament to the inherent shortcomings 
of the current system.
    Lack of a consistent presence by USDA officials at events featuring 
Tennessee Walking, Racking, and Spotted Saddle Horses has fostered a 
cavalier attitude among industry insiders, who have not stopped their 
abuse, but have only become more clandestine in their soring methods. 
The continued use of soring to gain an advantage in the show ring has 
tainted this segment of the horse industry, and creates an unfair 
advantage for those who are willing to break the law in pursuit of 
victory. Besides the indefensible suffering of the animals themselves, 
the continued acceptance of sored horses in the show ring prevents 
those with sound horses from competing fairly for prizes, breeding fees 
and other financial incentives, while those horse owners whose horses 
are sored may unwittingly suffer property damage and be duped into 
believing that their now abused, damaged horses are naturally superior.
    The egregious cruelty of soring is not only a concern for horse 
industry and animal protection organizations, but also for 
veterinarians. In 2008, the American Association of Equine 
Practitioners (AAEP) condemned soring, calling it ``one of the most 
significant welfare issues faced by the equine industry.'' It called 
for the abolition of the DQP Program, saying ``the acknowledged 
conflicts of interest which involve many of them cannot be reasonably 
resolved, and these individuals should be excluded from the regulatory 
process.'' The AAEP further stated, ``The failure of the HPA to 
eliminate the practice of soring can be traced to the woefully 
inadequate annual budget... allocated to the USDA to enforce these 
rules and regulations.''
    The USDA Office of Inspector General conducted a comprehensive 
audit of the Horse Protection Program, and issued its report in 
September 2010 documenting serious conflicts of interest and other 
significant problems with the industry self-monitoring system of HIOs 
on which the APHIS inspection program still relies. The report 
recommended the abolition of DQP inspections and an increase in funding 
for APHIS enforcement of the Horse Protection Act. The Agency concurred 
with the findings and recommendations in the report, pledging to 
abolish industry self-policing and agreeing with Recommendation 2: 
``Seeking the necessary funding from Congress to adequately oversee the 
Horse Protection Program,'' indicating that it would develop a 
budgeting and staffing plan to phase in the resources needed to 
adequately oversee the Horse Protection Program. Unfortunately, in 
recent years, it has been reported that USDA officials have stated 
their view that Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) have primary 
responsibility to enforce the HPA, not the Agency.
    It is unacceptable that more than half a century after passage of 
the Horse Protection Act, the USDA still lacks the resources needed to 
end this extreme form of abuse. It is time for Congress to give our 
public servants charged with enforcing this act the support and 
resources they need to fulfill their duty to protect these horses as 
effectively and safely as possible.
    We appreciate the opportunity to share our views, and your 
consideration of our request.

               Prepared Statement of Jazz Pharmaceuticals
    On behalf of Jazz Pharmaceuticals (Jazz), we respectfully submit 
this statement regarding the fiscal Year 2024 budget request for the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for inclusion in the Committee's 
official record. Jazz appreciates the Committee's support for FDA's 
ongoing regulatory oversight of cannabis and cannabis-derived 
substances, including encouraging high caliber research, review of 
product applications, and robust inspections and enforcement. We 
appreciate the Committee's support in the 2023 appropriations cycle and 
ask for a continuation of that support so FDA's work may continue.
         about our cannabis pharmaceutical development program
    Jazz, through GW Pharmaceuticals, is the first and only company to 
have brought a cannabis-derived pharmaceutical grade therapy through 
the drug review and approval process of the FDA. FDA approved 
Epidiolex(r) (cannabidiol) oral solution (Epidiolex) in 2018 for the 
treatment of seizures associated with two rare diseases, Lennox-Gastaut 
Syndrome (LGS) and Dravet Syndrome (Dravet); in 2020, FDA also approved 
Epidiolex for the treatment of seizures associated with tuberous 
sclerosis complex (TSC). In addition to continuing explore the 
therapeutic potential of Epidiolex for other serious medical 
conditions, we have other cannabis-based products in development, in 
both the United States and worldwide.
                background on cannabis and fda activity
    Cannabis is a complex plant containing more than eighty 
biologically active chemical compounds called ``cannabinoids.'' The 
most commonly known cannabinoids are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
(delta-9 THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).
    The 2018 Farm Bill \1\ established that ``hemp'' (i.e., cannabis 
plants and plant material with less than 0.3 percent delta-9 THC) and 
hemp derivatives were no longer controlled substances. In the 2018 Farm 
Bill, Congress also specifically preserved FDA's authority and affirmed 
the agency's role in protecting consumers and patients from dangerous 
products and unproven therapies.

    CBD is the active ingredient in Epidiolex, an FDA-approved 
prescription drug; therefore, it is illegal under the Federal Food, 
Drug & Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to add CBD to food or to market it as a 
dietary supplement.\2\ Yet, despite its illegality, CBD is widely 
available in consumables and personal care products. The global CBD 
market size was valued at $5.18 billion in 2021; U.S. sales of CBD 
products could climb as high as $11 billion by 2027.\3\

    These unlawful, CBD-containing products are often marketed with 
claims of medical benefits, without FDA approval, or any scientific 
evidence.\4\ FDA has also identified numerous gaps in understanding how 
CBD affects human health, and what is known points to real risks to 
consuming CBD for any reason, and especially without a physician's 
oversight. CBD can cause liver injury, interact with other drugs, 
potentially causing serious side effects, and is associated with 
reproductive toxicity and damage to fertility. CBD is also associated 
with changes in alertness and mood, and gastrointestinal distress. 
Additional questions also remain regarding CBD consumption, such as if 
it is consumed daily, for sustained periods of time, and CBD's impacts 
upon children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and fetal 
development.\5\

are Not Appropriate for Cannabidiol, Will Work with Congress on a New 
Way Forward (accessed March 9, 2023) (hereinafter ``Dr. Woodcock 
Statement'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Based upon these concerns, FDA concluded in January 2023 ``it is 
not apparent how CBD products could meet safety standards for dietary 
supplements or food additives.'' \6\ The agency has limited tools under 
the FDCA ``for managing many of the risks associated with CBD 
products.'' As a consequence, the agency announced it would not 
initiate rulemaking to permit CBD in dietary supplements and foods. FDA 
offered to work with Congress ``to develop a cross-agency strategy for 
the regulation of these CBD-containing products to protect the public's 
health and safety.'' This new regulatory pathway Congress might 
establish could include risk management tools for the agency to manage 
CBD risks to consumer health, including ``clear labels, prevention of 
contaminants, CBD content limits, and measures, such as minimum 
purchase age, to mitigate the risk of ingestion by children.'' \7\ In 
the interim, FDA committed to continuing ``to take action against CBD 
and other cannabis-derived products to protect the public.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While Congress and FDA continue to work together to develop an 
appropriate framework for CBD, we believe the following continuing 
concerns with cannabis-derived products merit inclusion of 
appropriations language:

  --Cannabis-Derived Products Can Pose Significant Health Consequences. 
        Cannabis-derived products are not approved by FDA and are often 
        promoted to vulnerable populations without a prescription or 
        healthcare professional oversight of dosing, side effects, and 
        drug interactions. This poses potential dangers to patient and 
        consumer health because some cannabis derivatives are known to 
        interact with a variety of commonly used prescription drugs, 
        cause liver complications, and have other adverse health 
        effects.\8\ State-legal cannabis products are frequently 
        contaminated with harmful substances, including mold, 
        pesticides, heavy metals, and bacteria.\9\

  --Dietary Supplements And Foods Containing Cannabis Derivatives Must 
        Be Differentiated From FDA-Approved Drugs To Preserve Research 
        And Innovation. FDA-approved drugs are studied for efficacy and 
        safety in the intended patient population and are manufactured 
        to exacting standards, all of which ensure American patients 
        have access to the safest and most advanced drugs in the world. 
        Dietary supplements and foods containing cannabis-derived 
        compounds need to be differentiated from FDA-approved drug 
        products. If there is no distinction made between approved 
        drugs and unapproved dietary supplements and foods, there is, 
        similarly, no incentive to undertake costly clinical research 
        to develop robust data on the therapeutic benefits of cannabis.

CBD, When Pregnant or Breastfeeding (accessed March 9, 2023); FDA 
summarized the clinical and pre-clinical data (and the absence of such 
data) on CBD safety in responses to three Citizen Petitions and two New 
Dietary Ingredient Notifications for CBD in full spectrum hemp 
extracts. See FDA Issues Response to Three Citizen Petitions Related to

Are your CBD and THC-rich consumables contaminated by heavy metals, 
pesticides, and reproductive toxins? N. Seltenrich (Dec. 14, 2022). 
State cannabis authorities have issued numerous recalls and advisories 
regarding cannabis products contaminated with yeast, mold, pesticides, 
heavy metals, and bacteria, including in Vermont, Nevada, Oregon, 
Colorado, Oklahoma, and Arizona.

  --Many Cannabis-Derived Products Are Marketed Deceptively And 
        Misleading Claims May Harm Deceived Patients. Since January 1, 
        2020, FDA has sent over 60 warning letters to marketers of hemp 
        cannabinoid products that were making unproven and false 
        medical claims, including treatment claims for COVID-19, 
        Parkinson's, epilepsy, bi-polar disorder, and autism. The 
        agency stated these marketing tactics put patients at risk 
        because the products were not demonstrated to be safe or 
        effective.\10\ While FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 
        have taken enforcement action against hemp manufacturers 
        marketing CBD with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims, they 
        have not taken similar action against medical cannabis 
        businesses operating in State programs despite those companies 
        utilizing the same unlawful marketing strategies. Numerous 
        studies have documented how cannabis manufacturers make health 
        and disease treatment claims about their products that are not 
        substantiated by science-based research or rigorous 
        testing.\11\ Widespread false and misleading marketing spurred 
        the American Medical Association (AMA) to urge FDA and FTC to 
        do more to ``protect consumers and combat marketing of 
        unapproved medical claims for cannabis'' when there is 
        ``currently little available evidence to demonstrate safe and 
        effective use of these products for these purposes, and in some 
        cases these claims are completely fabricated and with no 
        supporting evidence at all.'' \12\ Further, as one study 
        concluded, ``Regulatory action against unsupported therapeutic 
        claims by the medical cannabis industry has thus far been 
        anemic'' with at least one company that received a warning 
        letter continuing to make unproven and false claims.\13\ As the 
        AMA stated, permitting medical claims ``outside of those 
        validated through robust clinical trials has serious impacts 
        for all patients who may use cannabis and cannabis-based 
        products.'' These deceptions may keep some patients from 
        accessing appropriate, recognized therapies to treat serious or 
        fatal diseases.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        proposed report language
    The Committee is concerned about the proliferation of products 
marketed in violation of the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (the 
``FDCA''), including products containing derivatives of the cannabis 
plant. The Committee is aware that non-FDCA-compliant products pose 
potential health and safety risks to consumers through misleading, 
unsubstantiated, and false claims that cannabis and cannabis 
derivatives can treat serious and life-threatening diseases and 
conditions, including COVID-19 and cancer. Such products may also be 
contaminated with harmful substances.
    The Committee recognizes that FDA intends to work with Congress on 
creating a regulatory framework that could permit one compound in 
cannabis, cannabidiol (``CBD''), in consumer products. FDA indicated 
that such a framework could safeguard consumers by providing risk 
management tools to the agency to manage CBD risks, including labeling 
requirements, prevention of contaminants, content limits, and other 
public health protections, such as minimum purchase age, to mitigate 
the risk of ingestion by children.
    The Committee recognizes FDA's use of its existing authorities to 
undertake cannabis-related efforts, including research, requests for 
data, consumer education, issuance of guidance and policy around 
cannabis-based drug product development, and some enforcement against 
wrongdoers.\15\ The Committee expects FDA to continue and to increase 
these efforts given the proliferation of non-FDCA-compliant, cannabis-
containing products and the risks they pose to public health. The 
Committee also expects FDA to take enforcement action against the 
manufacturers of any cannabis products marketed with unlawful 
therapeutic claims to preserve the integrity of the drug development 
and approval processes, which ensures that products, including 
cannabis-containing products, that are marketed as drugs have undergone 
a rigorous scientific evaluation to assure that they are safe, pure, 
potent, and effective for the diseases and conditions they claim to 
treat. It is also imperative that FDA continue to exercise its existing 
authorities to preserve incentives to invest in robust clinical study 
of cannabis so its therapeutic value can be better understood.

    Prepared Statement of the National Association of State Energy 
                           Officials (NASEO)
    Chairman Heinrich and Ranking Member Hoeven, I am David Terry, 
President of the National Association of State Energy Officials 
(NASEO), and I am testifying in support of FY24 funding for the energy 
title of the Farm Bill. The mandatory levels of the energy title of the 
Farm Bill should be supported (2018 Farm Bill, Public Law 115-334). 
Specifically, we support funding of at least $50 million mandatory and 
$250 million in additional discretionary spending for the Rural Energy 
for America (REAP) program. Fifteen percent of the additional 
discretionary funds should be allocated to underutilized renewable 
energy technologies through a reserve fund. The REAP program was 
created in the 2002 Farm Bill and it has been a huge success. Over 
15,000 energy efficiency and renewable energy projects have been 
implemented in every State since 2003. Since the 2014 Farm Bill, REAP 
has leveraged $7 billion in private investments with the $338 million 
in appropriations. We also support $15 million in mandatory funding and 
$30 million in discretionary funding; a total of $45 million for the 
Rural Energy for America Loans program. ``On-bill'' energy efficiency 
financing programs for rural electric cooperatives is an important 
activity through USDA. Under the Rural Energy Savings Program (RESP), 
$26 million should be provided for FY'24. The models in South Carolina, 
Arkansas, and Washington are very exciting. This program should be 
dramatically expanded. We also recommend that beneficial 
electrification initiatives should be funded with both the REAP and 
RESP programs. These recommendations are in addition to funding under 
the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure, Investment, and 
Jobs Act.
    REAP has specifically benefitted farmers, ranchers and rural small 
businesses that are often underserved by other Federal energy efforts. 
NASEO's State Energy Office members work directly with eligible 
entities, as well as state agricultural agencies and rural interests to 
promote this successful program. REAP focuses on facilitating private-
sector led rural economic development.
    NASEO represents the energy offices in the 56 States, territories 
and the District of Columbia. The REAP program, and the other critical 
programs in the energy title of the last multi-year Farm Bill (and 
RESP), helps the private sector create jobs, supports increased 
agricultural productivity and operational efficiency, reduces energy 
costs for farmers, ranchers and rural small businesses, generates home-
grown energy, promotes use of alternative fuels produced by America's 
farmers, and further reduces our dependence on imported petroleum. The 
cost is very low and the payback is very high.
    As noted above, NASEO also supports additional energy title 
programs. There are several of note that should be supported at 
mandatory funding levels and RESP. These include the Biomass Crop 
Assistance Program, Biorefinery Assistance, Renewable Chemical and 
Biobased Product Manufacturing Assistance Program, and the Biobased 
Markets Program (otherwise referred to as ``Biopreferred''), the 
Biomass Research & Development Initiative, the Bioenergy Program for 
Advanced Biofuels, the Biodiesel Fuel Education Program, and the Carbon 
Utilization and Biogas Education Program.
    The RESP zero-interest loans to rural electric cooperatives, state 
financing entities and others help on residential and small business 
energy efficiency measures. RUS has awarded almost $290 million in RESP 
loans.
    In FY'24, we urge your support for the REAP program and the Rural 
Energy for America Loans program, and additional energy title programs 
as noted above. We also support expansion and support for ``on-bill'' 
financing programs (RESP) through USDA. For all these programs, we 
recommend streamlining the applications in order to reduce paperwork 
burdens for low-cost grants and loans. The REAP program's small grant 
cap should be raised to $75,000.

                                 ______
                                 
    Prepared Statement of the National Association of Wheat Growers
    The National Association of Wheat Growers (NAWG) appreciates the 
opportunity to provide testimony about our priorities for the fiscal 
year 2024 Agriculture Appropriations bill. Before outlining our fiscal 
Year 2024 requests, we wanted to say ``thank you'' for continuing to 
fully fund the U.S. Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative (USWBSI) in fiscal 
Year 2023. For fiscal Year 2024, NAWG supports funding the following 
U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service programs:
    As our leaders in Congress consider an fiscal Year 2024 Agriculture 
Appropriations bill, one of NAWG's main priorities will be to ensure 
that no provisions are included that would cut Farm Bill programs, 
particularly mandatory programs like crop insurance, farm programs, 
conservation programs, or trade promotion programs. As the 
Appropriations Committee works to lay out goals for Fiscal Year 2024, 
we respectfully urge you to protect crop insurance from harmful cuts. 
Even in good years, farmers need access to a strong and secure Federal 
crop insurance program, a program that farmers have described time and 
again as a critical linchpin of the farm safety net. Given the ongoing 
drought throughout winter wheat country and severely wet spring in 
spring wheat country, mandatory programs like crop insurance, farm 
programs, conservation programs, and trade promotion programs mustn't 
be cut or harmed. The 2018 Farm Bill passed through Congress with 
strong bipartisan, bicameral support and sent a clear message that 
these critical programs should not be harmed.
    NAWG also strongly urges Congress to provide at least $255 million 
for the Agricultural Trade Promotion and Facilitation Program with at 
least $200 million for the Market Access Program (MAP) and $34.5 
million for the Foreign Market Development (FMD) program in fiscal Year 
2024. We are asking that your subcommittee use discretionary funds to 
provide $7 million--less than 3 percent of the program investment--for 
USDA administrative and operational costs to help reverse the 
diminished real dollar value of MAP and FMD from being funded at the 
same level for over 15 years. MAP/FMD funding is critical to help U.S. 
farmers, ranchers, and food exporters keep pace and help us make up for 
a lost time after two and half years of trade conflict and retaliatory 
tariffs.
    Wheat is a vital crop and source of economic activity. In the 
United States, wheat ranks third in planted acreage, production, and 
gross farm receipts, according to the USDA's Economic Research Service 
(ERS). According to the USDA, in the 2022/2023 crop year, total U.S. 
farmers produced a total of 1.6 billion bushels of wheat from a 
harvested area on 35.5 million acres. In any given year, wheat farmers 
must deal with a number of disease and pest challenges that can only be 
addressed through public and private research efforts. Federal funding 
for agriculture research has remained stagnant, threatening the future 
viability and competitiveness of U.S. food systems by being out 
invested by competitors such as China.
    NAWG joins the National Wheat Improvement Committees (NWIC) and 
National Barley Improvement Committees in urging the Committee to 
maintain full funding for the UWSBSI. Fusarium Head Blight (Scab) is a 
plant disease attacking all wheat-producing regions of the U.S. that 
impacts not just growers but also millers and bakers because of its 
impact on the quality of wheat. The 2018 Farm Bill increased 
authorization for the USWBSI from $9.5 million to $15 million to 
enhance food safety and supply by reducing the impact of Fusarium Head 
Blight (Scab) on wheat and barley. While the President's budget zeroed 
out funding for the USWBSI, we appreciate Congress's role in the 
appropriations process and for fully funding the initiative for the 
past several years. Continued full funding is vital in supporting the 
agricultural economy and food system.
    Also, NAWG supports the NWIC's request to start funding a Wheat 
Resiliency Initiative (WRI) at $1.6 million to address new and emerging 
challenges to wheat production. The key challenges are wheat stem 
sawfly, Hessian fly, bacterial leaf streak, and the rust diseases. 
Changing weather patterns combined with the migration of pest and 
disease problems to regions previously unfamiliar with these yield 
robbers are resulting in substantial economic losses at the farm gate. 
For example, losses caused by wheat stem sawfly are now estimated to 
exceed $350 million annually for spring and winter wheat growers in 
Montana, Colorado, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, and Kansas. The 
Wheat Resiliency Initiative, over time, will require $6.5 million in 
new funding--equally split between intramural and extramural funding--
to meet its stated objectives and goals. Fully funded, the initiative 
will support multi-disciplinary research and involve scientists in 18 
States. However, providing an initial $1.6 million will help this 
initiative begin researching wheat stem sawfly and Hessian fly 
resistance.
    Together, these various pests and pathogens affect every growing 
region and market class of wheat grown across the U.S. Wheat is grown, 
milled, and delivered as a dietary staple in every State. If funded, 
through this initiative, the community of U.S. wheat researchers will 
build a new genetic base in all wheat market classes for resiliency to 
these challenges posed by wheat rusts, stem sawfly, hessian fly, and 
bacterial leaf streak. The strength of local agricultural economies of 
every State will be supported through building resiliency in the face 
of these challenges to wheat production.
    In addition to securing new resources for the WRI, NAWG encourages 
the subcommittee to provide an additional $750,000 for strip rust 
screening nurseries. Currently, the wheat stripe rust initiative 
receives nearly $200,000 annually to support public wheat research into 
stripe rust at facilities in Manhattan, KS; Raliegh, NC; Aberdeen, ID; 
and Pullman, WA. These additional resources would be used to support 
additional stripe rust screening nurseries in all wheat-producing 
regions.
    NAWG urges the Committee to continue to fully fund the Small Grains 
Genomic Initiative (SGGI) at $3.44 million. While the President's 
budget cut funding for the SGGI, the program provides critical 
resources to four research areas: Next Generation Genotyping, Next 
Generation Phenomics, ARS Uniform Small Grains Nurseries, and Doubled 
Haploid Research and Production. It is important to retain full funding 
for the SGGI in fiscal Year 2024.
    Lastly, NAWG supports retaining language that provides $1 million 
to support research focused on utilizing crop genetics research at 
public-private consortiums. NAWG applauds the funding of the National 
Predictive Modeling Tool Initiative (NPMTI) in fiscal Year 2022 at $5 
million, and we urge the committee to maintain or increase funding for 
the NPMTI as additional resources permit. NAWG continues to support 
maintaining at least the current level of funding for the NIFA Hatch 
Act, Smith-Lever Formula Grants, and the Agriculture and Food Research 
Initiative.
    Wheat research at the Federal level is driven by funding to the ARS 
division of USDA, land grant universities via Hatch Act and Smith-Lever 
Act funds, and Agriculture and Food Research Initiative competitive 
grants. State governments support wheat research through funding of 
public universities and agriculture experiment stations. Wheat growers 
in many States directly support wheat research through checkoffs or 
assessments on their crop each year. This collaborative partnership has 
made the United States one of the premier countries for wheat research, 
with all segments sharing in its cost. The investment has resulted in 
wheat varieties with the end-use quality that meets or exceeds the 
demands of our customers, both domestic and international.
    Agribusiness investment in wheat breeding and wheat improvement in 
the United States is minimal compared to other commodities. Private 
investment in wheat research has increased in recent years, but 
increased Federal investments must be made to provide solutions for 
problems affecting wheat productivity in the U.S. Wheat growers and the 
wheat industry depend on the USDA-ARS' public research efforts land 
grant universities to provide these solutions.
    The National Association of Wheat Growers works with our 20 wheat 
state associations and industry partners to benefit wheat farmers. 
These requests will directly help find new markets to export our wheat, 
provide critical investments in research, and facilitate innovative 
wheat research to improve quality and protect against disease and pest 
challenges. We greatly appreciate your consideration of these requests.

  Prepared Statement of National Coalition for Food and Agricultural 
                            Research (NCFAR)
    The undersigned organizations and institutions would first like to 
thank you for your collective efforts to complete the fiscal year 2023 
appropriations. As Congress moves forward to develop a 2024 spending 
package, we encourage you to support increased investments to advance 
food and agricultural research at the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) through the Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area.
    Recent data from the U.S. Economic Research Service indicates that 
for every $1 in public investment, U.S. food and agriculture R&D has 
returned $20 to the American economy. However, the report further notes 
that ``U.S. public agricultural R&D spending peaked in 2002, and by 
2019 spending had declined to roughly where it was in 1970.''
    The food and agriculture enterprise faces unprecedented challenges 
from extreme weather exacerbated by climate change, supply chain 
disruptions and rising food costs resulting from natural and 
geopolitical events, and adverse health outcomes related to nutrition 
insecurity and inequality. Fortunately, the key to addressing many of 
these challenges lies in strong Federal investments in the broad suite 
of research, education, and extension programs within USDA. We urge you 
to make the following investments in the final 2024 spending agreement.
    Provide $2.080 billion for the National Institute of Food and 
Agriculture Research (NIFA) as recommended in the House Agriculture 
Appropriations bill.
    As USDA's extramural funding arm, NIFA programs integrate research, 
education, and Extension to ensure that groundbreaking scientific 
discoveries are brought out of the laboratory and into the hands of 
those who can put them to work.
    Provide increased support for all the capacity programs, which are 
fundamental to the extramural research, education, and Cooperative 
Extension system.
    NIFA's capacity programs provide an innovation network supporting 
our Nation's Experiment Stations, research farms, and Cooperative 
Extension activities to keep the United States as the global leader of 
agricultural research.

  --Request $300 million in FY2024 for the Hatch Act account which 
        supports 1862 land-grant university federal-state partnerships 
        that employ science experts across each State at Experiment 
        Stations respond to critical issues that affect production, 
        profitability, invasive plant/animal species, biosecurity, land 
        and water use, climate resilience, economic analysis, and farm 
        safety. The multistate component of Hatch ensures coordination 
        on key projects that advance agricultural production and 
        processing, profitability, and sustainability.

  --Requests $108 million in FY2024 for the Evans-Allen account to 
        provide capacity funding for food and agricultural research at 
        the 1890 Historically Black land-grant universities and 
        Tuskegee University. The Evans-Allen Program enables research 
        for small farmer challenges, food security and nutrition, rural 
        prosperity and economic sustainability, natural resources and 
        the environment and workforce development. Most Black students 
        majoring in agriculture graduate from 1890s universities.

  --Request $17.5 million for the Tribal College Research program for 
        research funding that helps to protect reservation forests, 
        woodlands, grasslands, and crops, and monitoring of the quality 
        of soil, water, and other environmental factors.

  --Requests $46 million to support the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative 
        Forestry research which investigates carbon sequestration, 
        development of biobased products, prevention of forest fires, 
        identification of biobased-energy sources, and training of 
        forest and natural resource scientists.

  --Requests $420 million in Smith-Lever3(b) and 3(c) funds to support 
        the Cooperative Extension System (CES), a unique network of on-
        farm researchers, specialists, agents, and educators who 
        deliver vital, practical information to agricultural producers, 
        small business owners, communities, youth, and families.

  --Requests $88 million for the Extension Services of 1890s land-grant 
        universities. This program supports adoption of new farm 
        production and management approaches through informal education 
        via on-site demonstrations.

  --Requests $17.5 million in Fy2024 for Tribal Colleges Extension, 
        which supports community-based learning on topics such as 
        farmer education, youth development, diet and nutrition, and 
        rural entrepreneurship.

    Provide $500 million in funding for the Agriculture and Food 
Research Initiative (AFRI) as recommended in the House Agriculture 
Appropriations bill.
    AFRI is USDA's premier competitive research program, supporting 
fundamental and applied research to address key problems of local, 
regional, national, and global importance in conventional, organic, and 
urban agricultural systems. This funding level for the program is 
needed to invest in crucial areas aimed at addressing our Nation's most 
urgent and pressing food, agriculture, and public health challenges. 
AFRI-funded research supports COVID-19 recovery, climate change 
adaptation and mitigation, equity across the food system, food safety 
and traceability, supply chain resiliency, bioenergy, nutrition and 
wellness, agricultural technology, rural economic prosperity, and a 
diverse research workforce. At its current funding level, AFRI can 
support fewer than a third of the projects recommended for funding. 
AFRI research programs support the development of new technologies and 
a workforce that will advance our National security, agricultural 
productivity, and the health of Americans.
    Provide $500 million in funding for the Research Facilities Act 
(RFA) as recommended in the House Appropriations Minibus bill.
    Agricultural and food research solves global issues including 
preventing the next pandemic, addressing energy sustainability, 
limiting forest fires, and feeding global populations. Yet, the U.S. is 
at a hazardous crossroads and is rapidly losing ground as the global 
leader in agricultural science. 70 percent of the research facilities 
at U.S. public colleges of agriculture are at the end of their useful 
life. RFA funding will allow land-grant universities and non-land-grant 
colleges of agriculture to construct and modernize their research 
infrastructure to meet the needs of 21st century agricultural 
challenges.
    A 2021 report determined 70 percent of research facilities at U.S. 
public colleges of agriculture are at the end of their useful life with 
$11.5 billion in deferred maintenance. RFA allows for construction of 
modern facilities at colleges of agriculture that support agricultural 
research, that will increase pest and disease preparedness and use of 
advanced technologies, nation-wide.
    Provide $1.95 billion for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) 
as recommended in the Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill.
    As USDA's principal in-house research agency, ARS advances 
scientific knowledge through its four national program areas: 
nutrition, food safety and quality; animal production and protection; 
natural resources and sustainable agricultural systems; and crop 
production and protection. As one of the only funding sources available 
for long-term agricultural research, the ARS labs and research sites 
foster synergistic research collaborations across scientific 
disciplines and geographic locations. This funding would also help to 
address ARS infrastructure improvements critical to carrying out its 
research responsibilities.
    Provide at least $50 million in funding for the Agriculture 
Advanced Research and Development Authority (AgARDA) as recommended in 
the House Agriculture Appropriations bill.
    The power of an advanced research program lies in its unique 
selection process to identify innovative ideas and technologies, 
allowing significant achievements to occur more rapidly than in a 
conventional research setting. By fully funding AgARDA, Congress can 
respond to our most pressing challenges: threats from plant and animal 
pests and diseases, rising costs and limited availability of inputs, 
inefficiencies in planting, harvesting and processing, and 
vulnerabilities to increasingly extreme weather.
    Our food and agricultural system is vast, complex, and 
interconnected. Shocks from natural disasters, geopolitical 
instability, and labor and supply chain disruptions have shown us that 
now, more than ever, we need a radically different approach to 
achieving solutions. AgARDA can reach across the boundaries of 
traditional scientific disciplines and draw from industries of the 
future--nanotechnology, quantum computing, and machine learning--to 
sustainably increase the quantity and quality of our food supply.
    The U.S. food and agricultural enterprise is at a crossroad: 
continue to underinvest in research and innovation or support a robust, 
diverse public agricultural research portfolio that will transform our 
agricultural system and maintain U.S. global leadership. AgARDA can be 
a key component of that future, but we can't wait, the time to invest 
is now.
    Provide $98 million for the Economic Research Service (ERS) as 
recommended in the FY2024 President's Budget U.S. agriculture benefits 
greatly from ERS and NASS data and modeling. This information not only 
helps the industry and academia but also guides sound policymaking.
    Some of these datasets need to be developed from scratch and may 
lead to a better understanding of adaptation strategies to climatic 
change or improve our knowledge of mitigation strategies (e.g., the 
value of cover crops and why it is not widely adopted). These datasets 
can also help us better understand how to deal with disasters and 
reduce the cost of natural disasters. Data that can help understand the 
importance of capacity building in rural America. Finally, the datasets 
can also better inform us of the energy transition effect on 
underserved communities and the impact of climatic disasters on these 
communities.
    Provide $241 million for the National Agricultural Statistics 
Service (NASS) as recommended in the FY2024 President's Budget The 
investments in USDA research, education, and extension programs made 
today will be responsible for developing the scientific outcomes and 
workforce urgently needed to meet identified and as-yet unknown 
challenges in the future. We urge you to do all you can to support a 
robust, diverse research, education, and extension portfolio within 
USDA.
    We thank you for your continued support and look forward to working 
with you on this important effort.

    Sincerely,

    President, NCFAR
                                 ______
                                 
  Prepared Statement of National Commodity Supplemental Food Program 
                          Association (NCSFPA)
    Mister Chairman and subcommittee members, thank you for this 
opportunity to present information regarding the USDA/FNS Commodity 
Supplemental Food Program (CSFP). The National Commodity Supplemental 
Food Program Association (NCSFPA) requests that the Senate Agriculture 
Appropriations subcommittee fund CSFP for fiscal Year 2024 at 
$390,000,000 subject to cost revisions to be submitted by the U. S. 
Department of Agriculture. NCSFPA would also like to thank the 
subcommittee for providing sufficient funding to support CSFP service 
in all 50 States, and sustained caseload as we continue to support the 
program to statewide levels in all 50 States.
    CSFP is a unique program which brings together Federal and State 
agencies, along with public and private entities. CSFP currently 
provides services through over 150 non-profit community and faith-based 
organizations at 1,800 sites located in 50 States, the District of 
Columbia, Puerto Rico, and eight Indian Tribal Organizations (Red Lake, 
Minnesota, Oglala Sioux, South Dakota, the Seminole Nation in Oklahoma, 
the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe in North Dakota, the Shingle Springs Band 
of Miwok Indians in California, Wichita and Affiliated Tribes), and 
most recently, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, and Winnebago 
Tribe of Nebraska. Each month up to 760,547 low-income seniors are 
authorized to receive a nutritionally balanced food box. The program 
has moved to serve exclusively elderly participants, as required by the 
Agricultural Act of 2014. Our Association thanks the subcommittee for 
funding that enables us to continue serving our vulnerable population.
    The CSFP Local Agencies are committed grassroots operators with 
dedicated volunteers fulfilling a mission to provide quality nutrition 
assistance economically, efficiently, and responsibly. In cooperation 
with USDA, NCSFPA seeks to meet the current and emerging needs of CSFP 
participants. NCSFPA wishes to commend the Food Distribution Division 
of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) of the Department of 
Agriculture for their continued support of CSFP through the pandemic 
through efforts to address product shortages through substitute 
products and distribution flexibilities which we would like to 
continue, until production limitations subsided. At this time, CSFP 
agencies have been advised to return to distributing complete monthly 
boxes that will include all pre-pandemic items. Additional CSFP funding 
will continue to sustain national inventories and address the increased 
food costs.
    As the Food and Nutrition Service notes in its Budget Explanatory 
Notes:

                "According to the Census Bureau, the elderly population 
                in the United States has been growing over the past 
                several years and will continue to grow by an 
                additional 27 percent by 2050. SNAP data shows that, of 
                the proportion of the elderly population who are 
                eligible, only about 41 percent currently receive SNAP 
                benefits; meaning that many low-income, elderly persons 
                rely on other sources of food assistance through food 
                banks and food pantries, and programs such as CSFP.''

                ``CSFP requests a total appropriation of $390 million 
                in 2024 to continue to serve the full caseload of 
                764,000. This increase is due to current and projected 
                prices for commodities as well as the assumption that, 
                as the pandemic wanes, participation will return to 
                higher levels. Currently, the program is experiencing 
                lower-than-normal participation levels during the 
                pandemic, which is a reversal of the increased 
                participation trend seen in 2019 and early 2020. 
                However, by 2024, FNS expects that participation will 
                return to the robust levels seen pre-pandemic. CSFP is 
                currently able to support caseload due to an infusion 
                of resources from supplemental spending bills in 2021. 
                Those additional resources will be depleted during 
                2023.''

    Equally encouraging are the comments from the Presidential 
Proclamation honoring May 2022 as Older Americans Month:

                "Older adults have always been a vital source of 
                strength and resilience in America. During the 
                pandemic, many seniors came out of retirement to serve 
                their communities in health care and education roles, 
                filling job vacancies in critical shortage areas. 
                Moving forward, we must ensure that older Americans 
                have the appropriate resources to maintain their 
                independence and stay connected to their communities.'' 
                The President went on to say ``My Administration is 
                committed to keeping older Americans safe and healthy 
                as they age. The American Rescue Plan allocated $1.4 
                billion to providing older adults with services for 
                nutrition, health promotion, disease prevention, 
                caregiver support, and long-term care.''

    As a senior-based program, CSFP has a long-standing presence in 
providing healthy food to some of our most vulnerable citizens. 
Commitment to supporting CSFP in fiscal Year 2024 will build on that 
foundation at a time when our senior population continues to grow, and 
new distributions remain needed to reach unserved populations in States 
across the US.
    CSFP continues to be a testimony to the power of community 
partnerships with faith-based organizations, farmers, private industry, 
and government agencies. The CSFP offers a unique combination of 
advantages unparalleled by any other food assistance program:

  --The CSFP specifically targets one of our Nation's most 
        nutritionally vulnerable populations: low-income seniors.

  --The CSFP provides a monthly selection of food packages tailored to 
        specific nutritional needs.

  --The CSFP involves the entire community. Tens of thousands of 
        volunteers and private companies donate money, equipment, and 
        most importantly time and effort to deliver food to needy and 
        homebound seniors. These volunteers not only bring food but 
        companionship and other assistance to seniors who might have 
        limited support systems.

  --The COVID-19 pandemic provided some powerful examples of the 
        protective benefits of CSFP. While stores continued to see 
        limitations for some food items, CSFP participants still had 
        access to nutritious foods, provided through safe and socially 
        distant practices implemented during the pandemic. No-contact 
        distributions, including home deliveries, electronic intake 
        practices, and drive-up food pick-ups streamlined efforts to 
        protect staff, volunteers, and participants.

  --With the aging of the Baby Boomers and the coming 'Silver Tsunami', 
        CSFP is uniquely positioned to meet the nutritional needs of 
        our Nation's growing population of vulnerable seniors. 
        Replenishing national food inventories and increasing caseload 
        are vital as we work to keep up with this growing population.

    NCSFPA senior participants across the country value their CSFP 
benefits for both the balanced meals that CSFP provides each month and 
the interaction between seniors and program staff. CSFP is a program 
that promotes healthy lifestyles and reduces any discomfort associated 
with participation in food support programs. The program allows seniors 
to live more stable, self- sufficient lives, whether homebound, living 
with limited income, or lacking access to other food and support 
options. It allows participant income to be put toward other costs of 
living, such as rent/mortgage, utilities, medical care.
    America is aging and CSFP is an integral part of senior nutrition 
programming that is a cost effective and nutritionally sound way to 
ensure that today's seniors remain productive, healthy, and independent 
to maintain a good quality of life. It is of note that many seniors are 
now continuing to work at least part-time beyond retirement age to 
ensure that they can afford basic necessities. As such, CSFP is an 
important tool for them to remain healthy so that they may continue to 
be an active part of the work force.
    The Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee has consistently 
supported CSFP, acknowledging it as a cost-effective way of providing 
nutritious supplemental foods. We urge the subcommittee to provide 
$390,000,000 subject to cost revisions submitted by the U. S. 
Department of Agriculture for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program 
in order to allow us to provide needed services to a minimum of 760,547 
vulnerable seniors each month.
    Again, thank you for your continuing support. We look forward to 
working with you on behalf of CSFP participants.

  Prepared Statement of the National Environmental Health Association 
                                 (NEHA)
    The National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) represents 
almost 7,000 environmental health professionals throughout the U.S. and 
around the world. NEHA is the profession's strongest advocate for 
excellence in the practice of environmental health. Our mission is the 
advancement of the environmental health professional and we serve to 
provide quality training, continuing education, and credentialing to 
our members and environmental health professionals.
    As the committee reviews the fiscal year 2024 (FY 2024) budget, we 
would like to emphasize the following:

 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Program Name                 FY 2023          FY 2024 Request
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      the u.s. food safety system
    The U.S. has one of the safest, if not the safest, retail and 
manufactured food systems in the world. The rate of foodborne disease 
in our Nation, however, remains too high. The U.S. food industry is 
worth approximately $1.5 trillion, accounting for one-fifth of the U.S. 
economy. FDA oversees 78 percent of the U.S. human food supply.
    The programs highlighted above support efforts of the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) to provide resources to State, local, Tribal, and 
territorial (SLTT) food safety programs that protect this nation's food 
safety system through inspection, education, and enforcement.
    Foodborne illness outbreaks can originate from any stage in the 
food production line. Restaurants are the most reported location of 
food preparation associated with outbreaks, accounting for 64 percent 
of the outbreaks for which a single location of preparation was 
reported; most of such outbreaks (48 percent) occur in sit-down 
establishments.
    NEHA would like to highlight three points regarding this nation's 
food safety system:
    Food Safety Is Performed by State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial 
Agencies.
    The numerous Federal agencies regulating foods (primarily FDA) rely 
on their SLTT counterparts to implement their food safety programs. 
There are 70 State agencies alone that apply the FDA Food Code-mainly 
through their departments of agriculture, health, or environment-to 
protect the public from adverse food incidents. There are over 3,500 
local health departments with food safety authorities, several Tribal 
jurisdictions with delegated authority from their States and the 
Federal Government, and U.S. territories that have food safety 
responsibilities.
    SLTT programs implement the requirements of FDA food safety 
programs. The vast majority of food safety inspections, both retail and 
manufacturing, are performed by SLTT inspectors. The majority of 
enforcement actions occur by SLTT agencies, under SLTT authorities.
    FDA's Retail Flexible Funding Model (RFFM) provides the resources 
that SLTT food agencies need to meet the requirements of the Retail 
Food Standards and the Food Code, and has been very beneficial to the 
jurisdictions that have accepted the funding.
    Food safety will only succeed if SLTT agencies are well-funded 
through programs like the RFFM and provided with resources necessary to 
implement and administer food safety measures.
    The FDA Uniform Food Safety System promotes public health.
    National uniform adherence with FDA retail food regulation best 
practices-such as the FDA Food Code and Voluntary National Retail Food 
Regulatory Program Standards (Retail Program Standards)-decrease the 
occurrence of foodborne illness outbreaks. The FDA Federal and State 
Initiative and Integrated Food Safety System promote a uniform food 
safety system.
    The Retail Program Standards provide a clear set of evidence-based 
guidelines for self-assessment and continuous improvement of regulatory 
agency programs and processes. SLTT enrollment with the Retail Program 
Standards aids in the reduction of foodborne illness incidence by 
providing standardized training, program evaluation, and technical 
support for SLTT jurisdictions.
    Adoption of the FDA Food Code prevents foodborne illness. The FDA 
Food Code advances known practices for preventing foodborne illness. 
The code promotes the best advice from FDA to address the safety and 
protection of food offered at retail food and food service industries. 
FDA's purpose in maintaining an updated Food Code is to assist SLTT 
jurisdictions by providing them with a scientifically sound, technical, 
and legal basis for regulating the retail segment of the food industry.
    The Retail Food Safety Association Collaborative, a cooperative 
agreement funded by FDA, promotes the adoption of the Food Code.
    There are more than 3,500 SLTT government agencies that have the 
primary responsibility of regulating retail food and food service 
industries in the U.S., all of which follow some version of the Food 
Code. These agencies regulate food service operations in restaurants, 
retail food stores, food vendors, schools, hospitals, assisted-living 
facilities, nursing homes, and childcare centers.
    Conformance with the Food Code and Retail Program Standards 
encourages STLL jurisdictions to follow a standardized set of 
guidelines for food safety that are known to lower the incidence of 
foodborne outbreaks.
    A strong, qualified environmental health workforce is necessary to 
meet the public health mandate around food and human food needs.
    Trained and credentialed personnel within SLTT food safety programs 
prevent adverse foodborne health outcomes through ensuring human food 
remains healthy and nutritious. This workforce is vital in FDA meeting 
its human food objectives.
    Credentialed personnel within SLTT food safety programs improve the 
health and quality of life of people living in their communities. Their 
services prevent adverse health outcomes. FDA needs to improve its 
ability to recruit, hire and retain personnel with the skills necessary 
to meet its objectives, both at the Federal and STLL levels.
    According to the Reagan-Udall report on human foods, FDA should 
move to a stronger, more cooperative relationship with States and other 
local authorities. Approximately half of the human food inspections are 
done by States through contracts and cooperative agreements, accounting 
for over 13,190 human food inspections in FY22. Funding for a strong, 
qualified SLTT workforce through FDA's Federal and State Initiative, 
the Integrated Food Safety System, and the Retail Flexible Funding 
Model is imperative in meeting FDA's goal of meeting public health 
mandate around food safety.
    Food safety is a critical public health issue that affects 
individuals and communities across the U.S. and around the world.
    We look forward to working with Congress and FDA in funding a 
system that improves the Nation's food safety system.

                                 ______
                                 
              Prepared Statement of National Farmers Union
    I write on behalf of National Farmers Union's (NFU) more than 
220,000 family farmer, rancher, and rural members. Farmers and ranchers 
have faced many challenges over the past year, including high input 
costs and lingering supply chain disruptions caused by trade disputes, 
the COVID-19 pandemic, and Russia's war on Ukraine. Natural disasters 
and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change continue to 
make the business of farming more difficult. Additionally, underlying 
market concentration across food and agricultural supply chains 
continues to squeeze family farmers and ranchers.
    These challenges result in significant stress for farmers and their 
communities.
    As you draft and advance appropriations legislation, I urge you to 
provide funding for programs that alleviate the challenges facing rural 
and agricultural communities and that improve the resiliency of our 
food system.
                fair, competitive, and resilient markets
    Most sectors in American agriculture are dominated by a small 
handful of multinational corporations. Multiple waves of unfettered 
mergers and acquisitions over several decades have resulted in 
agriculture and food supply chains that are uncompetitive and that 
underpay farmers while overcharging consumers. This extreme 
concentration leaves food and agriculture supply chains less resilient 
and more vulnerable to shocks.
    Concentration in the livestock and poultry industries has been on 
the rise for decades. Just four companies controlled 85 percent of beef 
slaughter and processing in 2019, and concentration is high in pork and 
poultry as well. Concentrated market structures increase opportunities 
for anticompetitive behavior. Thus, it is essential that the Packers 
and Stockyards Act (P&S Act) is enforced. The P&S Act is a law meant to 
protect farmers from discriminatory and monopolistic practices in the 
livestock, meat, and poultry industries.
    NFU appreciates the committee's recognition of these issues in the 
FY23 funding bill by including our requested report language and by 
securing funding for enforcement of the Packers & Stockyards Act. NFU 
requests the continued inclusion of the following report language to 
address these issues:
    The Committee recognizes that consolidation in agribusiness can be 
detrimental to farmers, consumers, workers, and the environment. The 
Committee considers enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act a top 
priority and directs the Department to continue enforcing the act to 
the fullest extent of the law. Further, the Committee urges the USDA 
Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and other agencies and mission 
areas to fully incorporate fair and competitive markets priorities 
across relevant programs and operations.
    We also request that the Committee provide USDA AMS with additional 
funding for Packers and Stockyards Act enforcement at the $35 million 
level in FY24.
    Additionally, NFU supports the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service 
(AMS), Packers and Stockyards Division, being permitted to complete the 
P&S Act rulemakings the agency is currently promulgating. NFU opposes 
any efforts to interfere with USDA's rulemaking authority and the 
ongoing P&S Act rulemakings.
    Furthermore, NFU supports strong funding for USDA's Food Safety and 
Inspection Service (FSIS) to help ensure the safety of the Nation's 
commercial supply of meat, poultry, and eggs, and to support building 
fairer and more competitive markets for producers. NFU supports FSIS 
continuing to fund the reduction in overtime and holiday inspection 
fees for small and very small establishments. NFU also strongly 
supports USDA FSIS's comprehensive review and ongoing rulemaking 
regarding the ``Product of USA'' voluntary labeling claim.
                    climate change and conservation
    America's family farmers and ranchers have been and will continue 
to help address climate change. But they need the support of voluntary, 
incentive-based conservation programs to implement effective practices 
on their land. On-the-ground capacity at the Natural Resources 
Conservation Service (NRCS) continues to be a limitation for farmers 
seeking to implement conservation practices. Funding for Conservation 
Technical Assistance (CTA) is needed for NRCS to hire more staff and 
partner with organizations to do conservation planning on farms and 
assist with conservation program implementation.
    We ask that you provide no less than $1.2 billion in funding for 
Conservation Operations, including CTA, in FY24. The request for this 
funding should be in addition to any Congressionally Directed Spending 
used for Conservation Operations and CTA.
    Improved pasture and grazing management can play a substantial role 
in carbon sequestration and improving soil health. NFU appreciates the 
committee's provision of $14 million for the Grazing Lands Conservation 
Initiative (GLCI) in FY22 and FY23.
    We ask the committee to build on these investments by providing at 
least $30 million in FY24 for GLCI, administered by NRCS. The 
initiative should provide competitive grants or cooperative agreements 
for locally led efforts to provide technical assistance to help 
maintain and improve the management, productivity, and health of our 
Nation's grazing lands.
            farm and ranch stress assistance network (frsan)
    Farming can be a stressful and isolating occupation. There are 
multiple causes of stress among farmers and their families, including 
volatility in the farm economy, the financial risk involved in 
agriculture, weather unpredictability, and a changing climate. FRSAN 
funds regional service provider networks that connect individuals and 
their families engaged in farming, ranching, and other agriculture-
related occupations to stress assistance programs. These regional 
networks help State and local governments, nonprofits, and other 
institutions share best practices, fill service gaps, and avoid 
duplicating efforts. FRSAN has also helped existing service providers 
reach more individuals and families in need.
    We urge the committee to increase funding for FRSAN, administered 
by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), from $10 
million in FY23 to $12 million in FY24 to address the urgent need to 
address farm stress and save lives.
           rural cooperative development grant (rcdg) program
    The objective of the RCDG program, administered by USDA's Rural 
Business-Cooperative Service, is to improve the economic condition of 
rural areas by assisting individuals or entities in the startup, 
expansion, or operational improvement of rural cooperatives through 
Cooperative Development Centers. The RCDG program has received stagnant 
funding at $5.8 million since FY12. Congress should increase the 
funding available for Cooperative Development Centers to ensure 
technical assistance is available in more communities to help spur 
economic growth and job creation.
    NFU requests at least $15 million for grants through RCDG for 
Cooperative Development Centers for FY24.
                   broadband and high-speed internet
    Rural Americans are 10 times more likely than urban residents to 
lack access to quality broadband. Robust Federal investment in 
broadband internet connectivity is essential for advancing telehealth 
and distance learning in rural areas, and to ensure family farms and 
ranches can thrive. NFU supports the ReConnect Loan and Grant Program, 
which helps fund the construction, improvement, or acquisition of 
facilities and equipment needed to provide broadband service in 
eligible rural areas.
    NFU urges the committee to provide full funding in FY24 to continue 
the ReConnect Loan and Grant Program, administered by USDA's Rural 
Development (RD) Rural Utilities Service (RUS).
        food safety education, outreach and technical assistance
    The Food Safety Outreach Program (FSOP) provides outreach, 
education, and technical assistance to small- and mid-sized, beginning, 
and socially disadvantaged farmers and processors to help them comply 
with Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) regulations. FSMA regulations 
are complex, and it is essential that producers have access to 
assistance to help them understand how to comply with the law.
    To help ensure a safe food supply for American families, and to 
help small- and mid-sized, beginning, and socially disadvantaged 
farmers comply with food safety regulations, we urge you to provide $10 
million for FSOP, administered by the National Institute of Food and 
Agriculture (NIFA), in FY24.
    We also request robust funding for Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) FSMA implementation that will allow FDA to continue their current 
outreach, education, and technical assistance efforts. We request the 
following report language:
    The agreement directs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to 
provide outreach, training, and technical assistance to farmers for 
compliance with the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and directs 
FDA to provide funding at no less than the fiscal year 2023 level. The 
agreement also directs the FDA to continue working with small farms to 
clarify requirements for compliance with FSMA and directs FDA to 
provide funding at no less than the fiscal year 2023 level.
                               conclusion
    Thank you for your attention to these matters. If you have any 
questions or would like to further discuss NFU's requests, please 
contact Aaron Shier, NFU Government Relations Director, at 
ashier@nfudc.org.

    Prepared Statement of National Center for Appropriate Technology
Appropriations Bill: Agriculture
Specific Agency: Rural Business--Cooperative Service
Appropriations Account: Rural Cooperative Development Grants
Program: Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas
Amount requested for fiscal Year 2024: Appropriations: $3.5 million
Amount Provided in fiscal Year 2023: $3.5 million
                                summary
    ATTRA (Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas) provides 
trusted, practical, research-based information to tens of thousands of 
farmers, ranchers, extension agents, conservation professionals, on-
farm energy specialists, and urban agriculture practitioners. ATTRA is 
a long-standing Farm Bill program with a current authorization for 
appropriations of $5 million annually. ATTRA is a one-stop shop for 
sustainable agriculture information for farmers and ranchers, managed 
by the National Center for Appropriate Technology under a Cooperative 
Agreement with USDA Rural Development's Rural Business--Cooperative 
Service.
    The program offers free technical assistance on sustainable 
agriculture production and farm energy issues via a toll-free hotline 
that is answered in English and Spanish for nine hours per day and 
through our websites www.ncat.attra.org and www.ncat.attra.org/espanol. 
Assistance is also available through email, texting, social media, and 
online chat. NCAT's agricultural specialists include 30+ highly 
qualified experts from diverse agricultural disciplines including 
horticulture, agronomy, animal science, economics, soil science, 
business planning, and marketing. Most staff also have experience in 
farming, ranching, Extension, and education. The In addition to 
answering specific producer questions, the ATTRA staff also produce 
workshops, webinars, and multi-media materials and meet with producers 
at conferences and during farm visits and field days.
    In addition to technical assistance and educational materials, 
ATTRA also helps train military veterans with its Armed to Farm program 
and is accelerating the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices 
through NCAT's Soil for Water program, which combines peer-to-peer 
learning networks with rangeland monitoring, workshops, and direct 
producer technical support.
    We appreciate the current year appropriation of $3.5 million and 
for fiscal Year 2024, we again request $3.5 million, level funding with 
fiscal Year 23, as we continue to expand ATTRA services for technical 
assistance to respond to the myriad farming needs of our clients, 
including improving soil health and water retention, increasing farm 
resilience, expanding market opportunities, adopting on-farm renewable 
energy programs including agrisolar, and expand training for beginning, 
socially disadvantaged, limited resource, and veteran farmers.
    NCAT has also signed on in support of other appropriations requests 
when those requests are linked closely to ATTRA's mission and where 
ATTRA can provide resources and expertise to support other programs, 
including support for farm sustainability, climate resilience, soil and 
water conservation and quality, value-added marketing, on-farm 
renewable energy production, and farming opportunities for beginning 
socially disadvantaged, limited resource, and veteran farmers. These 
linkages are highlighted at the end of this testimony.
                    attra highlights and initiatives
    Educational Materials and Outreach: ATTRA offers over 1,200 
educational resources in print publications, webinars, databases, 
podcasts, videos, blogs, and tutorials directly related to sustainable 
agriculture, soil health, regenerative land management, climate 
solutions, business planning, and marketing. In its 2022 program year, 
ATTRA's digital resources were accessed over 2.5 million times. Fifty 
new podcast episodes were provided, along with 169 new videos and 
webinars. For example, ATTRA specialists presented a webinar to over 
250 NRCS staff on tools and equipment for small and urban farms, and to 
115 participants from various USDA agencies as part of the Southwest 
Drought Network on soil health and water resources.
    Technical Assistance: ATTRA provides one-on-one assistance, small-
group assistance, and peer-to- peer learning networks through 
workshops, conference presentations, farmer listening sessions, farm 
tours, and social media. In its 2022 program year, ATTRA provided TA to 
nearly 30,000 clients, including over 2,000 cases that required in-
depth research. Topics included grazing management, soil health 
training, cover crops, land access, bio-solarization, financing for 
producer cooperatives, and crop insurance education, among many others.
    Training: ATTRA has a strong reputation for providing practical 
training for farmers and ranchers, with a particular emphasis on 
beginning, socially disadvantaged, historically underserved, and 
military veteran farmers. More than 200 trainings are offered, 
virtually and in-person, each year.
    Armed to Farm is a sustainable agriculture training program for 
military veterans. During the 2022 project year, more than 1,000 
veterans have been trained, in-person and virtually, in week-long 
sessions through farm visits, hands-on activities, and classroom 
sessions on business planning, marketing, recordkeeping, access to USDA 
programs, and various production topics. In-person trainings in 2022 
took place in MD, GA, NM, and CA. To date 80 percent of participants 
are farming or in the process of starting a farm; 94 percent say that 
the training improved their ability to farm; and 35 percent added new 
enterprises to their farm since attending the training. NCAT hosts a 
website, newsletter, listserv, and an Armed to Farm Facebook page to 
connect veterans to resources and to facilitate peer-to-peer learning.
    Soil for Water is accelerating the adoption of regenerative 
agricultural practices that catch and hold more water in soils. Peer-
to-peer learning networks are combined with, workshops, and support for 
producers who are trying new ways to improve health of their land and 
soils. ATTRA resources have been leveraged to expand these networks 
with support from NRCS, SARE, and private foundations. Soil for Water 
is a free, voluntary network available to all commercial agriculture 
producers in the U.S. Soil for Water has launched a new website, online 
forum, and the Regenerator's Atlas of America to strengthen peer-to-
peer learning and networking opportunities.
    The AgriSolar Clearinghouse is connecting businesses, land 
managers, and researchers with trusted resources to support the growth 
of co-located solar and sustainable agriculture. The AgriSolar 
Clearinghouse boasts more than 400 peer-reviewed articles and practical 
resources for farmers, land managers, and solar developers to maximize 
land and farm revenue. The hub includes a peer-to-peer forum, a bi-
monthly newsletter, and one-on-one technical assistance from the NCAT 
energy and agriculture teams. ATTRA resources supporting farm energy 
solutions have been leveraged through the U.S. Department of Energy to 
develop the AgriSolar Clearinghouse.
    To learn more about ATTRA's activities, please see our 2021-
2022Report to RBCS as well as the ATTRA website.
                         attra regional offices
    Work carried out under ATTRA is accomplished among NCAT's 10 field 
offices, located in Butte, Montana (headquarters), Arkansas, 
California, Colorado, Idaho, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Hampshire, 
Pennsylvania, and Texas. Six of those offices provide support across an 
entire region of the U.S.: Montana covers the northern plains, Arkansas 
covers the southeast, California covers the west, Texas covers the 
southwest, New Hampshire covers the northeast, and Mississippi covers 
the Gulf States region
     attra and ncat contributions to other programs in the annual 
                          appropriations bill
    In addition to running a first-class education, training, and 
technical assistance program via a cooperative agreement with USDA with 
funds provided by this subcommittee, we also have a closely linked 
interest and make contributions to and help promote many other USDA 
programs and thus also have an interest in their annual funding level. 
We support of robust appropriations for the following:

  --NIFA's Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE)--$60 
        million

  --RBCS' Rural Energy for American Program (REAP)--$30 million

  --RBCS's Value-Added Producer Grants (VAPG)--$15 million

  --NRCS' Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative (GLCI)--$30 million 
        from within the NRCS CTA account

  --Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network (FRSAN)--$10 million

    NCAT is proud to be a long-term partner with USDA in support of 
sustainable agriculture, value-added production and marketing, local 
food systems, and training and technical assistance for beginning, 
socially disadvantaged, limited resource, and veteran farmers. We 
appreciate the subcommittee's ongoing support for ATTRA as the Nation's 
premier source of information on sustainable agriculture and for the 
range of other programs that help farmers thrive by producing healthy, 
fresh food to the American people while conserving natural resources 
and supporting rural communities.

    Prepared Statement of National Institute of Food and Agriculture
    Founded in 1912, FASEB is a nonprofit which provides a forum for 
educational meetings, develops publications, and disseminates results 
of biological research. Now the Nation's largest biomedical coalition, 
it represents 27 scientific societies and more than 115,000 researchers 
worldwide. Our mission is to advance health and well-being by promoting 
research and education in biological and biomedical sciences through 
collaborative advocacy and service to our member societies and their 
members.
    FASEB's fiscal Year 2024 Recommendation for the Agriculture and 
Food Research Initiative is $700 million to fulfill its mission as the 
leading competitive grants program for agricultural sciences.
    Federal investments in fundamental research have led to remarkable 
progress in the biological and biomedical sciences-an increasingly 
multidisciplinary team-based effort. These collaborative research 
efforts have enabled investigators to respond to pressing scientific 
challenges. Basic research was the groundwork for the speed-months 
instead of years-that led to the development of COVID-19 vaccines and 
also supports pre-clinical research involving the use of animal studies 
to achieve medical progress.
    A major contributing factor to the success of team science is the 
mobilization of core facilities and shared research resources (SRRs), 
including the scientific technology and expertise infrastructure within 
research organizations. SRRs and cores work across different scientific 
disciplines and deliver unbiased research data in support of scientific 
rigor and transparency. They are essential training grounds for the 
next generation of skills-based scientists from diverse backgrounds.
    Despite Congress' bipartisan support for investing in science, 
Federal funding for research has not kept pace with scientific 
opportunity, posing a threat to our Nation's competitiveness. We face a 
real threat of losing our edge in industries such as biotechnology if 
we do not continue to prioritize increasing investments in science, 
shared resource facilities, including core facilities, and building a 
diverse workforce.\1\ The U.S. spends less on research and development 
(R&D) than many countries. If the U.S. is to be prepared to respond to 
future threats, our scientific leadership must progress. According to 
Science Is Us, more than 67 million workers in the U.S. are 
professionals in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) 
fields. STEM economic activity accounted for 40.5 percent of U.S. gross 
domestic product in 2021.\2\

    Our agricultural system faces unprecedented challenges, including 
global food and fuel demand, water availability, and training a diverse 
agricultural workforce. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National 
Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is the lead Federal agency 
providing extramural funding for food and agricultural sciences. NIFA 
funds an interdisciplinary research portfolio that brings pioneering 
science to address complex problems through the Agriculture and Food 
Research Initiative (AFRI), our Nation's leading competitive grants 
program for agriculture that supports education, research, extension, 
and integrated projects. AFRI funds agricultural and food sciences 
research at colleges, universities, and other institutions nationwide. 
Established by the Farm Bill in 2008, AFRI funding, while not keeping 
pace with the cost of doing research, has resulted in numerous 
advances, including new wheat cultivars and novel ways to combat 
invasive species.\3 4\

    AFRI funds agricultural and food sciences research at colleges, 
universities, and other institutions nationwide. Established by the 
Farm Bill in 2008, AFRI funding, while not keeping pace with the cost 
of doing research, has resulted in numerous advancements, including new 
wheat cultivars and novel ways to combat invasive species.
    Despite AFRI's progress-and the need for scientifically informed 
solutions-the program is appropriated at about 65 percent of its 
authorization, leaving hundreds of innovative proposals unfunded. 
According to the latest AFRI 2020 annual report, of the total 2,783 
competitive grant applications for fiscal Year 2020, awards totaling 
$377,748,316 were made to 715 high-ranked applications across AFRI with 
a success rate of 24 percent. There were an additional 895 proposals 
that were highly ranked (Outstanding, High Priority, or Medium 
Priority) which were unsupported due to a lack of Federal funding.
    AFRI should be funded at its full $700 million authorization, which 
is $245 million above fiscal Year 2023 enacted (53 percent increase), 
to fulfill its mission as the leading competitive grants program for 
agricultural sciences.

    Prepared Statement of National Institute of Food and Agriculture
    Thank you for your continued support of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's (USDA) extramural research, Cooperative Extension, and 
education programs funded through the National Institute of Food and 
Agriculture (NIFA). The APLU Board on Agriculture Assembly (BAA) 
requests bold Federal investment in our Nation's colleges of 
agriculture and forestry by advancing funding increases for core 
accounts that underpin the strength of our Nation's public research, 
Extension, and education system serving U.S. food and agriculture.
    The return on investment of U.S. agriculture research and 
Cooperative Extension is $20 for every public $1 invested. Yet Federal 
support for NIFA agricultural research, education, and Extension has 
been flat in real dollars, resulting in destabilization of the very 
system the U.S. relies on to cultivate agricultural leaders, reinforce 
domestic preparedness against pests and diseases, and ensure the U.S. 
leadership in global food security and technology. We request 
investment that rebuilds U.S. preeminence across public university 
research, Cooperative Extension System, education programs, and 
research facilities.
                                research
    We respectfully request robust funding for the following programs 
that provide capacity and competitive funds to support faculty, 
students, and technicians solving climate, production, nutrition, and 
agricultural resilience challenges:

  --Hatch Act-$300 million: Agricultural Experiment Stations located in 
        every State provide research capacity for critical issues and 
        innovations that affect agricultural production, profitability, 
        and sustainability, such as climate resilience strategies, 
        conservation, economic analysis, food safety, invasive species, 
        biosecurity, and precision agriculture. Geographically relevant 
        research occurs across national, regional, State, and local 
        contexts.

  --Evans-Allen-$108 million: Agricultural research at 1890s colleges 
        of agriculture takes place due to Evans-Allen capacity funds 
        that enable research for small farmer challenges, food security 
        and nutrition, and workforce development. Most Black students 
        majoring in agriculture graduate from 1890s institutions.

  --1994 Institution Research Program-$17.5 million: The Tribal College 
        Research Program supports research that protect reservation 
        forests, woodlands, grasslands, and crops, as well monitor soil 
        and water quality.

  --McIntire-Stennis-$46 million: Forestry research capacity addresses 
        development of biobased products, prevention of forest fires, 
        identification of new energy sources, expansion of outdoor 
        recreational activity, and mitigation techniques for invasive 
        species. It is a direct source of funds for resource science 
        graduates.

  --Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI)-$500 million: The 
        flagship competitive grants program for Federal priorities that 
        improves rural economies, increases food production, stimulates 
        the bioeconomy, mitigates the impacts of climate variability, 
        addresses water availability issues, ensures food safety, 
        enhances human nutrition, and trains the next generation of 
        agricultural professionals.
                         cooperative extension
    We respectfully request increased investments for the following 
programs that support the Cooperative Extension System (CES):

  --Smith-Lever Section 3(b) and (c)-$425 million: Capacity for 1862 
        Extension that supports a network of land-grant-university-
        connected state, Tribal, and local educators who deliver vital, 
        timely, practical information to agricultural producers, small 
        business owners, communities, youth, and families.

  --Extension services at 1890 institutions-$88 million: Capacity that 
        assists 1890s in working with diverse communities with 
        research-based, non-formal education about market development, 
        acquisition of capital and technology, eState planning, and 
        profitability. Stakeholders include small to medium size 
        farmers or other underserved populations.

  --Extension services at 1994 institutions-$17.5 million: Enables 1994 
        institutions to deliver science-based, culturally relevant 
        extension education programs to address biobased energy, 
        production, and food safety needs, improving quality of life on 
        reservations.

  --Smith Lever 3(d) Programs-$95 million: Includes the following 
        important programs-Expanded Food and Nutrition Education 
        Program (EFNEP); Farm Safety and Youth Farm Safety Education; 
        New Technologies for Agricultural Extension; Children, Youth, 
        and Families at Risk; and Federally Recognized Tribes Extension 
        Programs.
                               education
    The agricultural sector will face severe workforce shortages in the 
near future. Robust funding in the following NIFA education programs 
for food, agriculture, and natural resources are critical to address 
the Nation's diverse talent needs:

  --Women and Minorities in STEM (WAMS)-$10 million: Increases student 
        success for rural women and minorities in agricultural 
        research, education, and Extension.

  --1994 Institutions Equity Payment-$17.5 million: Focuses on Tribal 
        college undergraduate and graduate studies in the food and 
        agricultural sciences by supporting curricula design, faculty 
        development, experiential learning, equipment, and student 
        retention.
                             infrastructure
    Our country is facing unprecedented challenges, from extreme 
droughts and floods to invasive species and new plant and animal 
diseases. What's more, a 2022 Economic Research Service (ERS) report, 
found that U.S. public agricultural R&D spending in 2019 was 1/3 of 
that in 2002 (constant dollars) and the U.S. is falling behind 
international trade partners including China and the European Union.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    However, our agricultural research infrastructure dates to the 
1950s and 1960s and cannot meaningfully address 21st century 
challenges. A 2021 report estimated that nearly 70 percent of these 
buildings are at the end of their useful lives, and the cost of 
upgrading deferred maintenance is $11.5 billion.\2\ With outdated and 
dilapidated facilities, scientists cannot be expected to keep pace with 
international competitors.

    To address this urgent need we request $500 million for 
agricultural research facilities at public colleges of agriculture, as 
authorized through the Research Facilities Act (RFA) in Section 7503 of 
the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (P.L 115-334). RFA will 
support competitive grants to land-grant universities and non-land-
grant colleges of agriculture for facility construction, alteration, 
acquisition, modernization, renovation, or remodeling.
         global agriculture research and extension partnerships
    Support critical international grants that foster international 
collaborations:

  --International Capacity and Competitive Grants-$15 million: 
        Partnerships to Build Capacity in International Agricultural 
        Research, Extension, and Teaching program strengthens 
        international collaboration and the exchange of research 
        results that promote teaching and Extension. Competitive Grants 
        for International Agricultural Science and Education program 
        strengthens U.S. economic competitiveness and promotes 
        international market development.

    The challenges our agricultural sector faces are significant and 
have broad, nationwide impacts. Our Cooperative Extension specialists 
are being asked to do more with less and our research facilities are 
falling down-not only hindering innovation, but our ability to recruit 
the best and brightest to the agricultural sciences, repercussions that 
will ripple throughout the ag sector for years to come. However, with 
bold investments across NIFA's extramural programs, there is an 
opportunity to transform the face of modern agriculture and ensure the 
United States remains a leader in agricultural innovation. We hope you 
will support us in these efforts.

       Prepared Statement of National Multiple Sclerosis Society
    Chairman Heinrich, Ranking Member Hoeven and Members of the 
Committee, thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony on 
behalf of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (Society) regarding 
fiscal year 2023 (FY23) appropriations for the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). The Society urges the Committee to fund the FDA's 
budget authority at the Administration's request of $372 million 
increase in BA (taxpayer) funding, including $3 million to fund the 
Neurology Drug Program.
    MS is an unpredictable disease of the central nervous system. 
Currently, there is no cure. Symptoms vary from person to person and 
may include disabling fatigue, mobility challenges, cognitive changes, 
and vision issues. An estimated 1 million people live with MS in the 
United States. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to minimize 
disability. Significant progress is being made to achieve a world free 
of MS. The Society, founded in 1946, is the global leader of a growing 
movement dedicated to creating a world free of MS. To fulfill this 
mission, we fund cutting-edge research, drive change through advocacy, 
facilitate professional education, collaborate with MS organizations 
around the world, and provide services designed to help people affected 
by MS move their lives forward.
    The Society sees itself as a partner to Federal agencies under the 
Committee's jurisdiction and partner with many of the programs that 
provide services across the country, particularly the FDA. While we 
advocate for the government's involvement in accelerating the 
discovery, development, and delivery of new treatments, we do it as an 
organization whose research investment exceeds $1 billion to date.
                          the role of the fda
    The FDA is the Nation's pre-eminent public health agency, 
responsible for oversight of more than $2.6 trillion in medical 
products, food, and other consumer goods. It oversees the entirety of 
new drugs and therapies, vaccines, medical devices, and personal care 
products and 70 percent of our Nation's food supply. Altogether, the 
products and industries regulated by FDA account for about 20 percent 
of all consumer spending in the United States, approximately $2.4 
trillion per year.
    No Federal agency's mission and responsibilities are more affected 
by changes in science, technology, innovation, and social trends than 
the FDA. People with MS not only rely on the FDA to approve safe and 
effective therapies to help manage their disease, but also to ensure a 
safe food supply, regulate tobacco (smoking may increase the risk of 
developing in MS and can worsen MS symptoms), help expedite the 
approval generic medications are approved to help address prescription 
drug affordability. Further, MS healthcare providers rely on the 
accurate, science-based information from the agency to utilize in 
conversations with people with MS, their families, and care partners 
around health care and treatment decisions.
    FDA's core mission should receive robust and sustained funding to 
meet the challenges of advances in science and technology that make 
regulatory decisions more complex and require greater sophistication 
and expertise to complete. The agency should have additional resources, 
more scientific and technical staff, and better analytical tools that 
support scientific-based decision-making and keep up with innovation in 
both food and medical products and we believe the Administration's 
request allows for FDA to invest in these key areas.
                       the neurology drug program
    The FDA has been instrumental in approving and regulating MS 
disease modifying therapies (DMTs), as well as other treatments that 
aid with symptom management. In 1992, there were no FDA approved 
therapies for MS. Today, we have more than 20 disease-modifying 
therapies approved by the FDA: however, . more work remains to help 
people with MS access needed DMTs, novel therapies, medications to aid 
in symptom management and ultimately to find a cure for MS. MS presents 
and progresses differently in every individual, and there are multiple 
variables that go into decision-making for the use of DMTs. DMTs are 
generally not interchangeable and do not work in every person with MS.
    The Society is grateful that Congress provided funding for the 
establishment of a Neurology Drug Program in FY23. We have long been 
concerned that the Agency does not have the personnel and expertise 
needed to develop policy and guidance that keep pace with emerging 
research in brain disease and neuroscience, as well as ensure that the 
Agency has a comprehensive approach to patient engagement as a core 
component of the regulatory process.
    Stakeholders report uncertainty and inconsistency in which types of 
data will be acceptable to individual review divisions regarding 
patient experience-informed endpoints. We believe that the initial 
investment in the Neurology Drug Program will allow FDA to gain the 
expertise to develop policies and guidance that keep pace with emerging 
brain science. We look forward to working with FDA personnel to ensure 
this investment results in advances that encompass all areas of brain 
health including neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, 
brain injuries and more.
    We believe that people with MS and patients in all disease States 
would be best served if the agency had consistent processes for 
engagement with all stakeholders and that these processes should be a 
core part of the agency's mission. The Society urges the subcommittee 
to ensure that these efforts are appropriately funded and prioritized 
within the agency's base funding, as this is an area of regulatory 
science that requires training and specific staffing throughout the 
agency and within review divisions.
                               conclusion
    In conclusion, we hope that the Committee continues to invest in 
the Agency and fund the FDA's budget authority at the Administration's 
request of $372 billion for FY24.

          Prepared Statement of the National Organic Coalition
    I am submitting this testimony on behalf of the National Organic 
Coalition (NOC) to detail our fiscal year 2024 funding requests for 
USDA programs of importance to the organic sector.
               usda/agricultural marketing service (ams)
National Organic Program
Request: $26.4 million

    Organic agriculture is one of the fastest growing sectors of 
agriculture, fueled by strong consumer demand. The organic sector now 
exceeds $66 billion in annual sales with over 27,000 certified organic 
family farmers and other businesses represented.
    The National Organic Program (NOP) is the agency charged with 
regulating and enforcing the USDA organic label. NOP was funded at $18 
million for FY 2021, $20 million for FY2022, and $22 million for 
FY2023. We are requesting $26.4 million for the NOP for FY 2024 in 
recognition of the need for enhanced oversight, enforcement, and 
rulemaking for the rapidly growing sector.
    In addition, we are requesting the following report language to 
encourage NOP to increase enforcement efforts regarding the soil health 
requirements of existing organic standards:

                USDA organic standards require organic farmers to use 
                farming practices that improve soil health, such as 
                crop rotations, cover cropping, and pasture-based 
                livestock practices. By improving soil health, these 
                farming practices also increase the carbon 
                sequestration potential of the soil and improve the 
                farm's resilience to extreme weather events and 
                patterns. To maximize the climate benefits of organic 
                agriculture, the Committee urges the National Organic 
                Program to continue to increase enforcement efforts to 
                ensure full compliance with the soil health and pasture 
                requirements of USDA organic standards.

                         usda (ams, nass, ers)
Organic Data Initiative
Request: $1 million for organic data collection and analysis

    Authorized by Section 7407 of the 2002 Farm Bill, the Organic 
Production and Marketing Data Initiative states that the ``Secretary 
shall ensure that segregated data on the production and marketing of 
organic agricultural products is included in the ongoing baseline of 
data collection regarding agricultural production and marketing.'' In 
addition to mandatory funding, Section 10103 of the 2018 Farm Bill 
authorizes $5 million annually in discretionary funding.
    As the organic industry matures and grows at a rapid rate, the lack 
of data for the production, pricing, and marketing of organic products 
has impeded further development of the industry and limited the 
functioning of USDA organic programs. Organic data collection and 
analysis at USDA has made significant strides in recent years but 
remains in its infancy.
    We request $1 million for FY 2024 for organic data collection at 
AMS, NASS, and ERS.
         usda/national institute of food and agriculture (nifa)
Organic Transitions Program
Request: $10 million

    The Organic Transitions Program, authorized by Section 406 of the 
Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Reform Act (AREERA) for 
Integrated Research Programs, is a research grant program to help 
farmers address challenges of organic production and marketing. As the 
organic industry grows, the demand for research on organic agriculture 
is experiencing significant growth as well. This research has broad 
applications to all sectors of agriculture, even beyond the organic 
sector.
    Many organic research needs go unmet because of lack of adequate 
funding. As demand for organic products continues to grow at a fast 
rate, domestic production of organic food has not kept pace, requiring 
a greater percentage of organic product to be imported to meet the 
consumer demand. Funding for organic research has not kept pace with 
the growth in the industry either.
    The Organic Transition Program was funded at $7 million for FY 
2021, and $7.5 million for FY 2022 and FY 2023. We are seeking $10 
million for FY 2024, with report language to specify that the increase 
in funding should be used for fund research regarding climate change 
and organic agriculture.

Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI)
Request: Report language on public cultivar development

    In recent decades, public resources for the development of improved 
plant varieties and cultivars have dwindled, while resources have 
shifted toward genomics and biotechnology, with a focus on a limited 
set of major crops and regions.
    In Section 7406 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, 
the National Research Initiative was merged with the Initiative for 
Future Agriculture and Food Systems to become the Agriculture and Food 
Research Initiative (AFRI). Congress included language within AFRI to 
make ``conventional'' plant and animal breeding a priority for AFRI 
grants, consistent with concerns expressed by the Appropriations 
Committee in past appropriations cycles.
    In the last several years, USDA has made regionally adapted 
cultivar development using conventional breeding techniques a higher 
priority within the plant breeding funding area.
    In response to direction from the Senate Agriculture Appropriations 
Subcommittee report language, a ``Conventional Plant Breeding for 
Cultivar Development'' program area was created within the Plant Health 
and Production and Plant Products (PHPPP) priority area with the 
Foundational and Applied Science RFA of AFRI. While this development 
represents progress, there are several areas where further improvement 
is needed: 1) the amount of funding overall remains extremely low 
relative to the need; 2) the AFRI practice of awarding three-to-five-
year grants conflicts with the longer-term breeding cycles required for 
public cultivar development projects 3) the ``Conventional Plant 
Breeding for Cultivar Development'' RFA does not specify that the 
cultivars developed with these grants should remain publicly available 
for farmers and for plant breeders for future breeding efforts; and 4) 
the maximum grant in this new program area priority is $500,000, 
whereas the grant limit within the other PHPPP program area priorities 
range from $650,000 for standard grants up to $800,000 for 
partnerships.
    Therefore, we request the following AFRI report language to address 
these concerns:

                Section 7406 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act 
                of 2008 specifies priority areas within the Agriculture 
                and Food Research Initiative [AFRI], including an 
                emphasis on conventional (classical) plant and animal 
                breeding. The Committee strongly concurs with the 
                intent of this section and appreciates the agency's 
                progress in creating a distinct Conventional Plant 
                Breeding for Cultivar Development program area priority 
                within the AFRI program for development of locally and 
                regionally adapted cultivars, as the Committee 
                previously directed. While noting this progress, the 
                Committee expects the agency to significantly increase 
                funding for this AFRI priority area, to increase the 
                timeframe for grants made in this area to be more in 
                keeping with classical plant breeding timeframes, to 
                increase grant funding limits to be parallel with the 
                other AFRI Plant Health and Production and Plant Health 
                program areas, and to require that cultivars developed 
                using these grants be publicly available for farmers 
                and for plant breeders for future breeding efforts. In 
                addition, the agency should take steps to improve its 
                tracking of public cultivar development projects within 
                AFRI. The Committee further directs the agency to 
                report its progress in meeting these requirements.

Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE)
Request: $60 million

    The SARE program has successfully funded on-farm research on 
environmentally sound and profitable practices and systems, including 
organic production. The reliable information developed and distributed 
through SARE grants is very helpful to organic farmers. SARE was funded 
at $40 million in FY2021, $45 million in FY2022, and $50 million in 
FY2023. The President's FY2024 Budget requests $60 million for SARE. We 
are also requesting $60 million for SARE for FY 2024.
          usda/national agricultural statistics service (nass)
Tenure, Ownership, and Transition of Agricultural Land (TOTAL) Survey
Request: $15 million

    Land access is a major challenge facing beginning, socially 
disadvantaged, and young farmers, including organic farmers. Sec. 12607 
of the 2018 Farm Bill tasked the National Agricultural Statistics 
Service with completing an updated TOTAL Survey to provide data on 
farmland ownership, tenure, transition, and entry of beginning and 
socially disadvantaged farmers. NOC is requesting $15 million for the 
TOTAL survey for FY2024.
                usda/agricultural research service (ars)
Organic Research within the Agricultural Research Service (ARS)
Request: $35 million

    Organic farmers across the country lack research on basic agronomic 
challenges. ARS organic funding has declined from over $15 million in 
FY2007 to just $12 million in FY2020. This is less than 1 percent of 
the ARS research budget. If ARS were to invest 6 percent of its total 
research budget on organic, commensurate with organic's market share, 
that would equate to over $120 million. To start addressing this 
inequity, we are requesting FY2024 report language to require not less 
than $35 million for ARS organic research.
    Thank you for your consideration of these requests.

      Prepared Statement of the National Treasury Employees Union
                       food & drug administration
    NTEU is grateful to have this opportunity to submit this statement 
of our views on Fiscal Year 2024 appropriations for the Food & Drug 
Administration (FDA) where our union represents the bargaining unit 
employees.
    The Administration has requested a 10 percent increase ($372 
million above the FY23 enacted level) for the Food & Drug 
Administration (FDA). The total FDA budget request is for $7.2 billion 
of which $3.93 billion would come from funds appropriated by Congress, 
$2.5 billion from medical products user fees, and $700 million from 
tobacco user fees. NTEU strongly endorses the Administration's request 
and urges Congress to fully fund the requested amounts.
    The FDA workload is constantly growing and must grow as private 
sector growth continues in medical, pharmaceutical, veterinary and food 
production marketing. To hold back FDA would mean to hold back the 
innovations of the private sector in these critical and necessary 
products. That would not be in the interests of the health and safety 
of the American public.
    FDA is a staff-intensive organization, with more than 80 percent of 
its budget devoted to personnel costs. FDA employees are among the most 
highly skilled and dedicated employees that will be found anywhere in 
the public or private sector. The agency needs to be able to recruit 
and retain skilled scientists, inspectors, chemists and other 
professionals. FDA certainly does not match the superior pay offered by 
the private sector, where these skills are very much in demand, but it 
does have a workforce committed to public service and public health.
    However, FDA has a turnover rate two times the government wide 
average and 70 percent of the staff are retirement eligible. According 
to a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, the crafts 
with the greatest pay and benefits differential from the private sector 
are scientists, physicians and regulatory attorneys. More broadly, 
there are hiring and retention problems with the professional and 
technical staff as well as those who work in medical product review. 
And of constantly growing importance is FDA's foreign inspection 
program. As we have told the Members of this Committee before, FDA has 
a hiring and retention crisis. Failure to overcome this crisis will 
mean a failure in the mission of FDA.
    NTEU applaudes the steps FDA has been taking to address this 
crisis. In listening to the employees at FDA, we find that the most 
effective initiatives are improved student loan repayment benefits, an 
expanded child care subsidy and telework. These initiatives can help 
retain skilled professionals while attracting new employees to service 
at FDA. Assuming robust implementation, these initiatiives will achieve 
great strides in addressing the staffing crisis. We believe that the 
President's budget submission includes the resources needed to fully 
implement these initiatives and that the funding allocated in the 
request should be directed there. In addition, each of these 
initiatives also create cost savings that help to mitigate their costs, 
particularly in decreasing new employee training.
    Telework and remote work provide the greatest opportunity for 
recruiting and retaining the best employees. While not all positions at 
FDA lend themselves to telework--chemists need to be in their 
laboratories and inpectors have always worked remotely as they move 
from facility to facility for their inspections--there are at FDA those 
who analyze text rather than substances or perform administrative or 
grants management tasks that are well suited for telework. In the 
coming years, FDA should re-evalute the amount of space it leases at 
taxpayer expense and significantly reduce its footprint, savings tens 
of millions of dollars. Further savings are likely to be achieved when 
full time remote workers re-locate away from the FDA offices which are 
often in urban areas with high Federal locality pay to rural and small 
town areas where the employee accepts a lower locality pay while at the 
same time bringing jobs and their paycheck to rural and small town 
America.
    However, there are three issues where FDA needs attention:
    Among the least desirable tasks of FDA Consumer Safety Officers 
(CSO) is carrying out overseas inspections. It has been very difficult 
to fully staff these positions even though it is essential that 
overseas pharmetcuticial, medical and food producers be held to the 
same high standards that domestic firms are held to. To hold importers 
to a more leinient standard than American producers not only harms the 
heath and food safety of American consumers, it is also unfair to 
American businesses.
    Let me be clear. These inspection trips are not a vacation. They 
are typically three week trips overseas visiting multiple facilities in 
remote industrial zones in countries like China. All Grade 12 or above 
CSOs are required to be available for these inspections. It is hard 
work, where inspectors spend this time away from their families in a 
foreign country where both the facility and the government may be less 
than welcoming and not committed to the transparency the inspector 
seeks. Employees also have concerns about their personal safety. FDA 
needs additional funding to make these jobs more desirable. NTEU 
supports new funding for bonuses for inspectors and reduction of trips 
from three weeks to two weeks. Congress should also fund positions at 
FDA to serve as translators for the inspectors. Currently the 
translators are provided by the facility or maybe even the Chinese 
government. While this has been a much criticized arrangement, to date, 
Congress has not provided the needed funding for FDA to hire its own 
translators.
    Recruiting and retaining the best and most highly skilled employees 
is not just a matter of compensation and worklife issues and FDA 
management needs to better recruit from parts of our society that have 
not been well included in the FDA staff. In our call for improved 
diversity, equity and inclusion at FDA, this year, I would like to 
particularly highlight the missed potential of many high skilled 
military veterans. The Department of Health & Human Services, which FDA 
is part, has one of the lowest percentage of military veterans on staff 
of any Federal agency. HHS is at 8 percent while 30 percent of Federal 
civilian employees overall are veterans. NTEU believes that while FDA 
suffers significant staffing shortages, there are significant numbers 
of qualified veterans who would make superior employees at FDA. More 
robust affirmative steps should be taken to notify veterans of 
employment opportunities at FDA, recruit them and retain them.
    Lastly, FDA is currently undergoing a reorganization of its food 
safety function. It would be useful for management to meaningfully 
consult with the union as it implements this re-organization.
    Thank you for your consideration. NTEU appreciates the opportunity 
to present this statement.

Year 2024 appropriations for agencies within the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture.
                        national organic program

Account: Agricultural Marketing Service
OFA fiscal Year 2024 request: $26.4 million

    The integrity of the organic label is organic farmers' top 
priority. If the National Organic Program is not able to enforce the 
organic standards, consumers will lose trust in the integrity of the 
label, putting the economic viability of organic farmers at risk. The 
NOP has oversight of the standards that define the USDA certified 
organic label as well as the accredited certifying agencies that 
inspect organic farms and food companies. The NOP must be able to grow 
to provide proper oversight of certifiers and enforcement in an 
industry that is rapidly expanding to create complex new supply chains 
that present numerous opportunities for fraud. Enforcement priorities 
for OFA include compliance with the Pasture Rule, finishing the 
Strengthening Organic Enforcement rulemaking, clarifying standards and 
certification interpretation of hydroponic and container operations, 
and reducing opportunities for fraud in the organic supply chain.
    Despite the explosive growth of the organic industry into a global 
industry and repeated instances of failures by USDA to keep up with 
oversight and enforcement, the NOP was level funded at $9 million from 
fiscal years 2014 to 2017. The NOP was funded at $16 million in 2020, 
$18 million in 2021, $20 million in 2022, and $22 million for FY23. We 
request $26.4 million for the NOP for fiscal Year 2024, and report 
language continuing to urge NOP to increase enforcement of soil health 
requirements critical to organic's role in addressing climate change, 
including use of cover crops, crop rotation and enforcement of pasture 
standards.
                        organic data initiative
Account: Agriculture Marketing Service, National Agricultural 
Statistics Service, and Economic Research Service
OFA fiscal Year 2023 request: $1 million (authorized level)

    As the organic industry has grown, we have struggled to represent 
that growth to policy makers and regulators, in part because USDA has 
been slow to develop systems to track the growth of organic. Increasing 
USDA's capacity to conduct the Certified Organic Production Survey and 
other organic data collection will not only help us show the public and 
policy makers that organic is a growth industry for U.S. farmers, 
having accurate data on the amount of organic acreage around the world 
will also help the National Organic Program and organic certifiers to 
better enforce organic standards. Accurate information about the amount 
of organic production that is happening can help provide a way to 
identify potential fraud in the supply chain.
    As the organic industry grows, the lack of good organic data has 
been an impediment. We request $1 million for the Organic Data 
Initiative for AMS, NASS, and ERS to expand organic data collection and 
analysis efforts.
                      organic transitions program
Account: National Institute of Food and Agriculture
OFA fiscal Year 2024 request: $10 million

    Many of the challenges facing the organic sector can be addressed 
with increased research. Organic research often investigates practices 
and challenges that are also relevant to farmers who are not certified 
organic or who farm conventionally. An increased focus on soil health, 
alternatives to chemical pest management and cover crops across all 
sectors of agriculture show that this kind of research can serve an 
audience that is wider than certified organic. The Organic Transitions 
Program focuses on these types of topics and addresses the historic 
backlog of research needs in this sector.
    The growth in demand for organic products means that there is 
potential for more organic farms and operations in the U.S., but 
obstacles such as research to address and promote organic farming 
solutions to production problems has lagged historically. Many of the 
debates about specific materials that can or cannot be used in organic 
production boil down to a lack of research on organic materials or 
practices that can be used as an alternative to the conventional 
approach of using a synthetic material. The backlog of research needs 
for organic farmers can begin to be addressed if the Organic 
Transitions Program continues to grow.
    OFA is requesting $10 million for fiscal Year 2024, with a focus on 
using the increase to fund climate change research related to organic 
agriculture.
         sustainable agriculture research and education program
Account: National Institute of Food and Agriculture
OFA fiscal Year 2023 Request: $60 million

    Another critical research program for organic farmers is the SARE 
program. SARE has been a leader in addressing key sustainability 
challenges facing agriculture for over 30 years and remains USDA's only 
farmer-driven research program. It has helped create more innovative 
organic and conservation farm practices that are adopted by farmers on 
the ground than any other competitive agricultural research program. 
Yet despite SARE's long-standing record of helping farmers and ranchers 
develop and adopt innovative practices and systems, the program has yet 
to reach its full authorized amount of $60 million. Without increased 
investments, farmers will not be able to meet future productivity 
challenges and remain competitive, and they will lack the easily 
accessible and regionally appropriate research that they need to 
develop sustainable and climate resilient farming systems. In light of 
this, we support full funding for SARE at its authorized level of $60 
million for fiscal Year 2024.
 organic research within the agricultural research service (ars)--$35 
                                million
    Organic farmers across the country lack research on basic agronomic 
challenges. ARS organic funding has declined from over $15 million in 
FY07 to just $12 million in FY20. This is less than 1 percent of the 
ARS research budget, versus organic's market share of 6 percent. If ARS 
were to invest 6 percent of its total research budget on organic, it 
would equate to over $120 million. To start addressing this inequity, 
we are requesting $35 million for ARS organic research in FY24.
              usda response to pfas contamination of farms
    OFA urges the Committee to instruct USDA to assist state 
agriculture departments in a robust response to the emerging issue of 
per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination of farms and 
livestock. The widespread use of PFAS chemicals in a variety of 
industries makes it likely that the PFAS-contamination of farmland and 
livestock being discovered in some States is likely to be repeated 
around the country. The USDA could assist States in responding to this 
emerging crisis for farms in several ways:

  1) creating an indemnity or disaster response program for farms 
        (other than dairy farms) with PFAS contamination;

  2) conducting and disseminating research on the fate and transport of 
        PFAS in soils to various types of crops and foods;

  3) conducting and disseminating research on methods for remediating 
        PFAS contaminated farm soils or livestock;

  4) providing grants, equipment and technical assistance to States to 
        increase capacity for testing farm soils and water supplies.
 funding for regionally adapted, public cultivar development programs--
                          afri report language
    Farmers need access to seeds and animal breeds adapted to their 
farming systems, soils and climates. USDA recently responded to the 
request by the Senate Appropriations Committee for a separate AFRI 
funding stream for regionally adapted cultivars, by establishing an 
AFRI ``cultivar development'' program priority area. The FY2024 
appropriations bill should call for increased funding for this AFRI 
priority area.
    Thank you for the opportunity to present this testimony on fiscal 
Year 24 funding levels for programs that serve organic farmers.

Research into organic agriculture topics at ARS facilities
Request: $35 million and report language

    Organic farming is a bright spot in the agriculture economy, yet 
organic producers across the country remain disadvantaged by the lack 
of research on basic agronomic and economic challenges. Funding from 
the USDA ARS for organic farming research is not commensurate with the 
continued rapid growth of the organic market. In fact, according to ARS 
data, current organic farming research funding within the agency 
represents less than one percent, or about $15 million, of the total 
ARS research budget. Meanwhile, the organic sector's market share is 
six percent, which should reflect over $120 million in ARS research 
funding. This funding gap must be closed to provide equity and address 
barriers to wider adoption of organic production practices. Investments 
in organic agriculture research will advance the substantial 
contributions of the organic sector's efforts to address pressing 
environmental, climate, and human health concerns. The ARS research 
facility located in Salinas, California conducts the sole organic 
focused research project in the country, and continues to produce high 
quality, action-oriented research products but continues to face budget 
constraints and is at risk.
    The ARS recently released its Organic Research Priorities and 
roadmap for organic research to the Appropriations Committees. These 
priorities highlight the need for continued and expanded investments 
into researching organic crop and livestock production necessary to 
provide organic farmers cutting edge, usable research and technologies. 
Putting this plan into action is critical to meet the needs of organic 
and transitioning to organic and transitioning to organic producers.
    ARS works at the forefront to find solutions to agricultural 
problems. The long-term research carried out at the agency is and will 
continue to be critical in preparing farmers and ranchers, organic and 
non-organic, to adapt to and mitigate the climate crisis. ARS National 
Programs and LTAR sites support long-term basic and applied research 
vital to the understanding of phenomena such as soil carbon 
sequestration, nutrient cycling, plant-soil-microbe interactions, and 
climate resilience in different farming systems. We believe that 
increasing funding for organic research, building on the just-released 
ARS strategic plan for organic research, will help the agency address 
the historical lack of investment in organic agriculture research and 
help organic and non-organic producers alike overcome challenges to 
realize their potential to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of the 
climate crisis.
    In conjunction with that agency plan, we believe that appropriators 
should act to ensure organic agriculture receives its share of the ARS 
research budget to reverse the chronic underinvestment in organic 
research at the agency. A $20 million increase in Fiscal Year 2024 
would put the ARS research budget on a path toward an equitable 
distribution of research funding for organic agriculture over the 
course of the next several fiscal years. ARS looks to the 
Appropriations Committee for their direction, and providing clear 
support for expanding organic agriculture research is necessary for ARS 
to act.
    Therefore, we request the following ARS report language:

                The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) currently 
                invests $15 million, or less than one percent of their 
                budget, into organic farming research. Meanwhile, the 
                organic sector's market share is six percent and 
                growing. Organic's fair share of the total budget 
                should reflect over $120 million in ARS research 
                funding; this $35 million request in FY24 is a down 
                payment toward meeting the need. This funding gap must 
                be closed to provide equity and address barriers to 
                wider adoption of organic production practices. 
                Investments in organic agriculture research will 
                advance the substantial contributions of the organic 
                sector's efforts to address pressing environmental, 
                climate, and human health concerns.

Organic Transitions Program
Request: $10 million

    This is a key competitive grants program that supports organic 
agriculture research at universities around the country, including many 
research programs that benefit farmers and consumers across the United 
States. The overall goal of the Organic Transition Research Program 
(ORG) is to support the development and implementation of research, 
extension and higher education programs to improve the competitiveness 
of organic livestock and crop producers, as well as those who are 
adopting organic practices and transitioning to organic certification. 
Investing in organic systems research is an effective way to invest in 
developing tools to support both climate mitigation and adaptation 
through land management. Practices and systems addressed by ORG include 
those associated with organic crops, organic animal production, and 
organic systems integrating plant and animal production. ORG 
consistently receives more funding requests than can be accommodated as 
consumer demand for organic products outpaces domestic production. For 
example, in 2020 there were 34 applications and only 12 awards 
distributed. Without continued funding of ORG as an organic-specific 
research grant program, this gap will only increase.
    The program should be funded at $10 million in FY2024, to ensure 
that U.S. farmers and ranchers have the information and technology 
necessary to meet the high demand for organic products in the 
marketplace.

Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program
Request: $60 million

    The Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) program 
has a clear and consistent focus on sustainability and farmer-driven 
research. For over 30 years, SARE has been at the forefront of research 
and extension activities for farming systems based on profitable and 
environmentally sound practices developed with farmer and business 
input. Despite SARE's popularity and demonstrated administrative 
efficiency, after more than 30 years of proven on-the-ground results, 
the program has yet to reach its full authorized amount of $60 million. 
As a result, USDA can only fund roughly 10 percent out of all eligible 
research and education pre-proposals submitted to the program each 
year. We urge Congress to provide full funding at $60 million for SARE 
in fiscal Year 2024.
 usda--economic research service, agricultural marketing service, and 
                national agricultural statistics service
Organic Data Initiative
Request: $1 million

    The Organic Data Initiative (ODI) collects and disseminates data 
regarding organic agriculture through the Agricultural Marketing 
Service (AMS), Economic Research Service (ERS), and National 
Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). This program has been 
successful in providing valuable information to Congress, government 
agencies, and the organic sector. Funding specifically designated to 
the Organic Data Initiative is used for economic analysis, organic risk 
assessments, survey and statistical analysis, and market data 
collection and analysis. We urge strong funding for this small but 
valuable program, this increase in funds would allow for stronger 
intra-agency cooperation and be used to modernize systems and provide 
high-value, accurate organic price reporting and organic data 
collection.
    Organic farms, both certified and non-certified, throughout the 
United States, representing an over $52 billion industry, will benefit 
from an increase in organic farming data tools and functions.
    Thank you for the consideration of these requests, and I look 
forward to discussing them with you.

       Prepared Statement of the Organic Trade Association (OTA)
    On behalf of the Organic Trade Association (OTA) and membership, I 
respectfully request appropriate and adequate funding levels and 
oversight for programs whose mandate is to support the growth of the 
organic industry. OTA is the membership-based business association for 
organic agriculture and products in North America. OTA is the leading 
voice for organic in the United States, representing over 10,000 
organic farms and businesses across all 50 States through direct 
membership and our farmer's advisory council. Our members include 
growers, shippers, processors, certifiers, farmers' associations, 
distributors, importers, exporters, brands, consultants, retailers, and 
others. OTA believes increasing appropriations for U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) programs and initiatives which regulate current 
operations or benefit new farmers entering organic is important as the 
industry continues to experience growth on a year-to-year basis.
    Despite the many challenges facing the food and agriculture sector, 
U.S. organic soared to new highs in 2022, growing to $66 billion in 
annual sales. As one of the fastest-growing food and farming sectors in 
the U.S. and global marketplace, organic is an increasingly essential 
part of American agriculture. Organic provides economic opportunities 
for farmers, creating jobs, and lifting rural economies, while also 
utilizing sustainable farming practices which benefit the environment. 
Organic provides a safe, healthy choice to consumers, who are 
increasingly seeking out the trusted USDA Organic seal on the food and 
products they purchase for their families.
    Therefore, in order to continue this growth, we request the 
Committee consider the following appropriations requests for USDA 
programs most impactful on organic production in the United States:

  --USDA (AMS) National Organic Program (NOP)--$26.4 million;

  --USDA (FSA) Organic Certification Cost-Share Program (OCCSP)--$5 
        million;

  --USDA (NIFA) Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative 
        (OREI)--$10 million;

  --USDA (AMS) Organic Data Initiative--$1 million; and,

  --USDA (NIFA) Organic Transition Research Program--$10 million.
                     national organic program (nop)
    The National Organic Program (NOP) is the regulatory program within 
the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service responsible for developing and 
enforcing national standards for certified organic agricultural 
products. These standards assure consumers that products with the USDA 
organic seal meet consistent, uniform standards. The NOP is vital to 
meeting growing consumer demand for organic products. Recognizing the 
continued growth of the industry, we ask for $26.4 million, the full 
amount of the last authorization plus an additional 10 percent to 
accommodate growth. Moreover, this would give NOP the resources it 
needs to enforce the organic regulations globally, to continue to 
develop international equivalency agreements to expand the market for 
American organic products worldwide, and to develop new organic 
standards for emerging sectors. Increased funding will allow NOP to 
update existing standards to address developing new developments in 
best practices, scientific evidence, and consumer demands. Therefore, 
OTA requests $26.4M for continued operations of the NOP.
    Additionally, non-foods represent 10 percent of the organic 
marketplace. OTA requests the subcommittee consider the inclusion of 
report language addressing the ability of NOP to enforce standards 
``The committee requests that the National Organic Program apply its 
authority to the maximum extent possible and exercise oversight and 
enforcement of organic claims made on agricultural products which are 
non-food, including but not limited to textiles (processed fiber 
products), dietary supplements, pet food, personal care products 
(including cosmetics), household items (e.g. cleaners, detergents), and 
flowers, and assist any other agencies that might have some authority 
over these final products with a definition of organic production and 
handling and rules for the use of organic label claims. Additionally, 
the Committee requests the National Organic Program to take steps to 
ensure any certifying agents acting on the behalf of the USDA are 
applying the organic standards for non-foods in a uniform and 
consistent manner.''
            organic certification cost-share program (occsp)
    The Organic Certification Cost Share program is important to 
attracting new, young farmers to organic. Farms can receive up to $750 
each year (75 percent of the certification fee) through the Farm Bill 
to help defray the annual costs of organic certification. However, 
despite the commitment of Congress to assist organic farmers, the last 
2 years USDA announced reimbursement rates for certification costs 
would be cut to 50 percent of the certified organic operation's 
eligible expenses, up to a maximum of $500 per scope due to funding 
shortfalls. We urge the inclusion of this additional funding to ensure 
that organic farms and businesses can continue to count on this long-
standing program to help offset their certification requirements as the 
producers continue to experience increasing costs. In order to 
accommodate the growing need and actions of the USDA in previous fiscal 
years, OTA requests $5M for the program.
      organic agriculture research and extension initiative (orei)
    OREI is the flagship research program for organic agriculture 
within USDA. Research is necessary to measure and optimize the outcomes 
of organic agriculture systems and develop new ecological technology--
which benefits both organic and conventional producers, as conventional 
producers often adopt ecological agricultural practices developed from 
this research. Organic makes up six percent of U.S. food sales and 
should be equally represented in Federal research funding. OREI 
receives mandatory funds through the Commodity Credit Corporation, but 
OTA requests an additional $10 million of discretionary funding to 
ensure the benefits of organic research reach farmers in the field 
through increased extension and outreach activities.
                organic [tc1][pm2]data initiative (odi)
    The organic industry has grown at a tremendous rate over the past 
several years, and accurate data for the production, pricing and 
marketing of organic products is essential to maintaining stable 
markets, identifying fraud, creating risk management tools, tracking 
production trends, and increasing exports. ODI collects and 
disseminates data regarding organic agriculture through the 
Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the National Agricultural 
Statistics Service (NASS) and the Economic Research Service (ERS). This 
program has been successful in providing valuable information to 
Congress, government agencies, and the organic industry at a low cost. 
The necessity of this data is evidenced by the difficulty in obtaining 
the data to properly roll out the Organic Dairy Marketing Assistance 
Program, which would deliver needed relief to organic dairy farmers as 
a result from rising costs due to the war in Ukraine and supply chain 
issues. OTA asks for $1 million in discretionary funding for the 
agencies tasked with data collection and analysis to continue 
collecting organic pricing information and conducting surveys and 
expand collections to levels comparable to conventional agriculture. 
Increased data collection will empower Congress and USDA to better 
modify existing programs so organic farmers can fully participate.
               organic transition research program (org)
    The overall goal of the Organic Transition Research Program (ORG) 
is to support the development and implementation of research, 
extension, and higher education programs to improve the competitiveness 
of organic livestock and crop producers, as well as those who are 
adopting organic practices and transitioning to organic certification. 
Practices and systems addressed include those associated with organic 
crops, organic animal production, and organic systems integrating plant 
and animal production. ORG consistently receives more funding requests 
than can be accommodated as consumer demand for organic products 
outpaces domestic production. Without continued funding of ORG as an 
organic-specific research grant program, this gap will only increase. 
OTA requests Committee fund the program at $10 million, to facilitate 
growth of this important research.
    In conclusion, organic food and farming are built on a commitment 
to shape our collective future for the better. The organic industry is 
creating jobs, stimulating our rural economy, creating domestic 
capacity, and delivering quality products in high demand to consumers. 
OTA requests the subcommittee continue to work towards providing the 
necessary support to achieve even greater success.
    I thank the members of this subcommittee for their consideration 
and look forward to working with you to advance the organic industry.

    Sincerely,

       Prepared Statement of the Oregon Water Resources Congress
    The Oregon Water Resources Congress (OWRC) strongly supports 
increased funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) 
Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) programs for fiscal Year 
2024. A minimum of $4 billion is needed to support watershed protection 
and irrigation modernization efforts across the Nation, split between 
the PL-566 programs, the Regional Conservation Partnership Program 
(RCPP), and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Within 
the PL-566 programs, a minimum of $1 billion is needed to support 
ongoing irrigation modernization efforts under the Watershed Protection 
and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO) Program and $500 million is 
needed for coordinated Federal agency watershed planning and assistance 
with dam rehabilitation under the Small Watershed Rehabilitation 
Program (SWRP).
    OWRC was established in 1912 as a trade association to support the 
protection and use of water rights and promote the wise stewardship of 
water resources in Oregon. Our members are local governmental entities, 
including irrigation districts, water control districts, drainage 
districts, water improvement districts, and other agricultural water 
suppliers that deliver water to one-third of all irrigated land in 
Oregon. These water stewards operate complex water management systems, 
including water supply reservoirs, canals, pipelines, fish screens, and 
hydropower facilities.
                    pl-566 program needs & benefits
    Our members in Oregon face many challenges related to irrigation 
water supply reliability, including recurring drought, aging 
infrastructure, climate change, and issues related to the Endangered 
Species Act (ESA) and the Clean Water Act (CWA). While there are common 
concerns and interests throughout irrigated agriculture, each basin is 
unique, and necessitates local communities' work collaboratively to 
identify needs and develop tailored solutions. NRCS's programs support 
multi-benefit projects that help improve water quality, restore 
habitat, and more efficiently deliver water to users, without placing 
the entire burden on the backs of the agricultural economy that 
produces food and fiber for our Nation.
    These programs also leverage scarce State and local resources and 
incentivize phased-in strategic approaches to meet the myriad of 
watershed needs, allowing for irrigation districts and other partners 
to plan and implement projects incrementally. NRCS-funded irrigation 
modernization projects go through a robust public outreach and scoping 
process which leads to the development of a Draft Watershed Plan and 
Environmental Assessment. Once the watershed plan is completed and 
approved by NRCS, the project is eligible for implementation funding 
through the PL-566 WFPO program. While the 2021 Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law provided $500 million for WFPO, this amount is still 
woefully insufficient in comparison to the multitude of funding needs 
in Oregon and across the Nation. Given the high interest in planning or 
implementing projects using NRCS PL-566 funding, we anticipate a 
sustained demand for additional funding to support projects like the 
examples below.
                  examples of wfpo projects in oregon
    The irrigation modernization projects below are in various stages 
of developing and implementing Watershed Plans through the WFPO 
program. More projects like these could be developed and implemented in 
Oregon and throughout the Nation with additional Federal support.
    Arnold Irrigation District, Deschutes County--The District recently 
received approval for its NRCS Watershed Plan and is moving forward 
with its first phase of project implementation in Fall of 2023. The 
overall project will convert 11.9 miles of open canals into pipe and 
install two SCADA systems to improve operational efficiency over the 
course of 6 years. Additionally, 88 turnouts will be upgraded to 
pressurized delivery systems. The project will save 32.5 cfs of water, 
conserve 80.8K kWh/year in energy, improve water quality, and improve 
52 miles of the Deschutes River. The District is seeking funding for 
the subsequent phases of its Watershed Plan.
    Hermiston Irrigation District, Umatilla County--The District is 
proposing to modernize aging infrastructure to conserve water, improve 
operational efficiencies, improve water quality, enhance fish and 
wildlife habitat in the Umatilla River, reduce public safety risks, and 
increase recreation opportunities. By converting open-ditch irrigation 
canals into underground, closed-pipe systems or lining the District's 
remaining open canals, the proposed Hermiston Irrigation District 
Modernization Project could reduce conveyance and operational losses 
over the entire irrigation season and improve the District's ability to 
efficiently provide water to its patrons.
    Klamath Drainage District, Klamath County--The District is process 
of developing a Watershed Plan to modernize district irrigation 
infrastructure and improve watershed protection. Proposed projects 
include install fish screens at the district's diversions on the 
Klamath River, extend and re-engineer sections of canals to increase 
flows to the Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge (LKNWR), and 
improve the district's use and control over water throughout the 
district. The proposed project would enable the district to improve 
water management within the district's conveyance system and benefit 
fish populations by preventing fish from getting trapped in the 
district's canals. By reducing water use inefficiencies, the proposed 
project would improve water quality. The project would also allow the 
district to supply additional water to the LKNWR, which would increase 
critically needed habitat for wildlife.
    North Unit Irrigation District, Jefferson County--The District is 
moving forward with implementing initial projects from its Watershed 
Plan, which will install 27.5 miles of gravity-pressurized, buried 
pipe; upgrade 153 turnouts; and construct four 1,000 cubic-yard 
retention ponds, each approximately 0.5 acres in size. The project will 
improve water conservation on District-operated laterals; improve water 
delivery reliability and drought resilience to NUID irrigators; reduce 
NUID's operation and maintenance costs; reduce operational spills into 
natural waterbodies; and improve streamflow, water quality, and habitat 
in the Deschutes River. Following project completion, 4,567 acre-feet 
of the water saved annually by the project would augment water supplies 
for NUID's existing patrons, helping to fulfill existing water rights, 
and alleviate water supply shortages across the District. The remaining 
1,522 acre-feet of water saved annually would be allocated for instream 
purposes and released into the upper Deschutes River during the non-
irrigation season.
    Tumalo Irrigation District, Deschutes County--The District was 
among the first in the Nation to receive funding for an Irrigation 
Modernization Project through WFPO and has been implementing identified 
projects in phases over the past 5 years. The project includes 
modernizing up to 1.9 miles of the District's canals and 66.9 miles of 
laterals to improve water conservation, water delivery reliability, and 
public safety. The project will occur in phases over 11 years. By 
converting open irrigation ditches into a closed piped system, the 
project will reduce water loss from canals by up to 48 cubic feet per 
second (cfs). Water saved from the project will be protected in the 
Deschutes River and Tumalo Creek, benefiting fish and wildlife habitat. 
The project also will deliver water to irrigators in a safer, more 
efficient manner and reduce energy consumption from pumping. The 
District is reaching the final phases of funding eligibility based on 
current program caps but still has several project phases to implement.
    Owyhee Irrigation District, Malheur County--In recent years, the 
District has faced droughts that limit water supply to irrigators and 
the design and age of the District's conveyance system no longer meets 
its obligations. To address these concerns, funds will be used to 
implement ag-water management and conservation practices and 
rehabilitate the conveyance system to improve water delivery 
reliability and water conservation throughout the District. Modernizing 
the conveyance infrastructure will enable opportunities to benefit the 
local agricultural community by improving drought resilience and 
reducing inefficiencies associated with the current system.
              small watershed rehabilitation program needs
    OWRC also strongly supports funding for projects under the Small 
Watershed Rehabilitation Program. Two of our members, Sutherlin Water 
Control District (SWCD) and Middle Fork Irrigation District (MFID) have 
dams that were built under the original PL-566. SWCD and MFID have 
received funds to begin the long and expensive process of updating 
their 50-year-old dams to today's standards for safety, however; both 
districts will need continued funding from the Watershed Rehabilitation 
Program and other NRCS funding programs to fully update their 
infrastructure.
    SWCD operates two dams built under PL-566, Plat I and Cooper Creek, 
located in the Umpqua River watershed in Douglas County. While they 
were built to seismic standards 55 years ago, they do not meet today's 
standards for earthquakes. SWCD's dams serve as multi-purpose storage 
for the community: providing flood control, irrigation water for 
farmland, municipal water for the city of Sutherlin, and recreation. To 
date, SWCD has been authorized to receive funding for planning, design, 
and construction of one of their dams and planning and design for the 
other. However, SWCD will still need considerable funding dollars to 
complete necessary work on both dams. Current estimates for Cooper 
Creek are 2.4 million for construction and a minimum of $7 million for 
Plat I, primarily for dredging, sediment removal.
    MFID is responsible for the management and maintenance of Clear 
Branch Dam, a PL-566 dam within the Hood River watershed, which 
provides a clean, dependable water supply and distribution system for 
the irrigation of pears, apples, cherries, and other high value crops. 
Rehabilitation of the dam is needed to protect the public from 
flooding, for access to a clean and dependable water supply, and to 
maintain agricultural productivity. In the past year, MFID has 
continued the dam rehabilitation planning process with its Federal 
partners (NRCS as the lead Federal agency and USDA Forest Service as a 
cooperating agency), which has included analysis of elements to include 
in an updated watershed workplan and EIS document. Planned 
rehabilitation project elements that support dam stability include 
seismic upgrade, seepage mitigation, fish passage and water quality 
improvements that support ESA listed species while maintaining the 
project purpose and the need to support irrigated agriculture with a 
clean and dependable water supply. Considering the high costs to fix 
just three of the PL-566 dams in Oregon, and the immense price tag of 
modernizing infrastructure to increase water conservation, preserve 
wildlife habitat, and increase water reliability for farmers and 
ranchers, a minimum of $500 million is needed to fund this important 
program in fiscal Year 2024.
                      rcpp & eqip benefits & needs
    OWRC strongly supports robust funding for RCPP and EQIP, which are 
critical tools for districts and other agricultural water suppliers in 
developing and implementing water and energy conservation projects in 
Oregon. RCPP currently has over 2,000 partners engaged in locally led 
conservation efforts that help implement collaborative basin-level 
solutions and reduce detrimental legal action, resulting in better 
outcomes for all. Since 2014, RCPP has invested over $1 billion in over 
375 projects across all fifty States and Puerto Rico. That $1 billion 
investment has leveraged an additional $2 billion from State and local 
partners for a total of $3 billion invested in RCPP related water 
conservation projects. Federal support of water conservation activities 
funded through NRCS programs, including the RCPP, is essential to the 
conservation of our natural resources and critical to protecting our 
food, energy, and water supply. Irrigation districts in Oregon are the 
model of successful RCPP projects that ``innovate, leverage additional 
contributions, offer impactful solutions and engage more 
participants.''
    Ongoing RCPP Projects in Oregon--East Fork Irrigation District, 
Hood River County--This project brings together a diverse set of 
partners in the Hood River watershed to focus on a top-priority water 
conservation and fish habitat project. The project will construct Phase 
1 of a pipeline project, assist agricultural producers with 
approximately 400 acres of on-farm water conservation practices, 
educate producers and farm workers on the latest irrigation water 
management techniques, and restore one mile of spawning and rearing 
habitat for threatened fish species. NRCS programs that will support 
these efforts include EQIP, CSP, and PL566. Together, these projects 
will increase irrigation water reliability for high value food crops, 
improve resilience to drought, and restore instream habitat for ESA-
listed species.
    Additional funding for PL-566, RCPP, and EQIP programs will ensure 
NRCS can continue to provide critical technical and financial 
assistance to project partners and build upon momentum from successful 
projects to accelerate innovative solutions to some of our most vexing 
water management challenges. Increasing the budget for NRCS programs is 
a strategic investment that will pay both environmental and economic 
dividends for current and future generations in Oregon and nationally.
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on fiscal Year 
2024 Budget for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Natural 
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) programs.

Sincerely,

April Snell, Executive Director

                                 ______
                                 
    Prepared Statement of the Personalized Medicine Coalition (PMC)
    Chairman Heinrich, Ranking Member Hoeven and distinguished members 
of the subcommittee, the Personalized Medicine Coalition (PMC) 
appreciates the opportunity to submit testimony on the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA)'s fiscal year 2024 appropriations. PMC is a 
nonprofit education and advocacy organization comprised of more than 
220 member institutions across the health care spectrum who are working 
together to advance personalized medicine in ways that benefit patients 
and health systems. We appreciate that the subcommittee provided an 
increased budget for FDA in fiscal Year 2023 to allow the agency to 
continue carrying out its public health mission. However, the agency's 
responsibilities increase in complexity each year. For this reason, the 
agency requires a budget that grows each year. Thus, as the 
subcommittee begins work on the fiscal Year 2024 Agriculture, Rural 
Development, FDA, & Related Agencies Appropriations bill, we 
respectfully ask that you continue to invest in FDA by appropriating 
$3.914 billion to FDA's budget authority as requested by the 
Administration. Such an increase will position FDA to provide access to 
safe and effective medical products, including advances in technologies 
that are the foundation for the future personalized medicine.
    Personalized medicine, also called precision or individualized 
medicine, is an evolving field in which physicians use diagnostic tests 
to determine which medical treatments will work best for each patient 
or use medical interventions to alter molecular mechanisms that impact 
health. By combining data from diagnostic tests with an individual's 
medical history, circumstances, and values, health care providers can 
develop targeted treatment and prevention plans with their patients. 
Personalized medicine promises to help us detect the onset of disease, 
pre-empt its progression, and improve the quality, accessibility, and 
affordability of health care.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Budget authority provides FDA with the broadest and most flexible 
means of meeting all its responsibilities.\2\ Previous increases in 
budget authority enabled the agency to implement multiple programs 
facilitating the development of personalized medicine products, which 
require greater sophistication and expertise to review. Additional 
increases in fiscal Year 2024 budget authority would allow FDA to 
expand these initiatives and launch new ones with a highly skilled and 
technically empowered workforce equipped with modernized analytical 
tools that support science-based decision-making. By increasing Federal 
investment in FDA activities fostering the development of innovative 
medical products, real-world evidence (RWE), and digital health, 
Congress can help usher in a new era of personalized medicine at a 
pivotal moment, promising a brighter future for health systems and 
patients with unmet medical needs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                the role of fda in personalized medicine
    Thanks in part to a responsive regulatory agency, personalized 
medicine is progressing steadily. As of 2022, more than 300 
personalized treatments are available for patients. That number has 
continued to grow, with personalized medicines accounting for more than 
a quarter of all new drugs approved by FDA for each of the past 8 
years, including 34 percent of the new drugs approved by FDA last 
year.\3\ These new approvals are helping to transform care for 
molecularly selected subsets of patients with cancer, where 53 percent 
of newly approved personalized medicines are indicated, as well as 
rare, common, and infectious diseases, which account for the rest. In 
2022, FDA also approved five gene and cell-based therapies and new 
diagnostic indications for 12 testing platforms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ https://www.personalizedmedicinecoalition.org/Userfiles/PMC-
Corporate/file/report.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    FDA is the gateway for many personalized medicine breakthroughs 
entering the market. FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health 
(CDRH), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and Center for 
Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) each have responsibilities for 
evaluating the safety and efficacy of breakthrough medical products. As 
personalized approaches to treatment and prevention have grown, new 
types of drugs, tools, and technologies leveraging complex and 
sophisticated data, like RWE, have challenged existing regulatory 
frameworks and processes.
     facilitating the development of personalized medicine products
    FDA is taking a number of steps to modernize its regulatory 
processes, such as streamlining its technical and data infrastructure 
to shorten review times, improving clinical trials to address unmet 
medical needs, integrating RWE into medical product reviews, and 
building partnerships to foster digital health and artificial 
intelligence (AI) technologies. In future years, robust funding from 
Congress will help FDA continue to build upon this work and bring 
personalized medicine products to patients as efficiently as possible.
                     expediting product development
    As a byproduct of scientific breakthroughs, the amount and variety 
of data that FDA generates, needs and uses is rapidly increasing. Even 
though FDA has taken action across the agency in recent years to make 
more rapid decisions and improve communications with medical product 
developers, the agency's technical infrastructure remains fragmented. 
In 2021, FDA announced a new Office of Digital Transformation to 
advance the agency's information technology transformation, which began 
in 2019. The $10 million included in the Administration's proposed 
budget for fiscal Year 2024 would allow further investments in 
enterprise data and IT modernization to streamline data practices 
across centers and help translate FDA's wealth of information into 
knowledge supporting progress in personalized medicine.
    The agency must also bolster its workforce to build in 
flexibilities across each of its centers and to keep pace with the 
growing pipeline of cell and gene therapies. Cell and gene therapy 
holds considerable potential for the treatment of hereditary genetic 
disorders, including rare, neurodegenerative, and infectious diseases. 
The number of cell and gene therapy submissions FDA receives is rising 
sharply. More than 200 new gene therapy Investigational New Drug 
applications are coming to FDA's CBER annually, up sharply from just 
over 100 in fiscal Year 2017.\4\ CBER provides extensive scientific and 
regulatory advice to product manufacturers throughout the medical 
product lifecycle. The center also develops policy and guidance on 
novel clinical, scientific, and manufacturing challenges for these 
products. An increase in FDA's budget authority would allow the agency 
to continue working with stakeholders to facilitate end-to-end 
solutions addressing key issues limiting the development and 
application of gene therapies, like manufacturing challenges, that make 
these therapies cost-prohibitive and in some cases not commercially 
viable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      modernizing clinical trials
    More rare diseases and cancers are being defined by biological 
markers, creating smaller groups of patients who are more likely to 
respond to targeted treatments and are candidates for participation in 
trials. Trials that rely on identification of patients by biological 
markers, such as enriched trials, trials with master protocols, and in 
silico trials using computer modeling, present opportunities to 
streamline clinical research, especially in cases where a scarcity of 
patients makes a randomized control infeasible and where important 
personalized medicines may be delayed or discarded because FDA cannot 
afford to run the trials needed to validate them.
    For many rare diseases, treatments are now within reach. Incentives 
and regulatory pathways, however, must be maintained for all rare 
diseases to make development financially viable. FDA's Orphan Products 
Grant Program supports the development of products to treat orphan or 
rare diseases including programs to support clinical trials, natural 
history studies, and new authority to fund grants addressing regulatory 
science challenges.\5\ Advances in the understanding of rare diseases 
and novel technology platforms have transformed many disease pipelines. 
By providing $30 million for the Orphan Products Grant Program, this 
subcommittee can respond to the documented economic burden rare 
diseases present to families and the country.\6\

    To help expand the development of new scientific approaches and 
tools available for advancing effective medical products that can 
prevent, diagnose, mitigate, and treat rare neurodegenerative diseases, 
Congress passed the act for ALS Act. This bill authorized $2.5 million 
in funding for staffing to support implementation.\7\ To allow FDA to 
facilitate access to therapies for neurodegenerative diseases such as 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) while continuing to focus on 
innovation and scientific advancement of new medical products to 
address other critical and rare diseases, the subcommittee should 
provide the agency with the full authorized funding level.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Administration's fiscal Year 2024 budget proposal also calls 
for $50 million for FDA to advance the President's Cancer Moonshot 
goals. These funds would enhance agency-wide efforts to improve 
evidence generation for underrepresented subgroups in oncology clinical 
trials. They would also support pragmatic, decentralized trials and the 
development of sources of evidence that incorporate patient-generated 
data and RWE.\8\ If appropriated, these resources will assist in the 
expansion of FDA's efforts to facilitate the approvals of innovative 
new cancer treatments by international regulatory authorities at the 
time of FDA approval, thus fostering collaboration on cancer treatments 
with other countries with standards comparable to those prevailing in 
the U.S.

             advancing the use of real-world evidence (rwe)
    Traditional post-market studies require years to design and 
complete and cost millions of dollars. The use of data collected 
outside of a clinical trial plays a vital role in answering key 
questions about therapeutics, diagnostics, and other healthcare 
interventions. The proliferation and widespread adoption of electronic 
health records, as well as other emerging digital health solutions, 
have made real-world data (RWD) an attractive source of data for 
clinical and translational research. FDA has a long history of using 
RWD and RWE to monitor and evaluate the post-market safety of approved 
medical products. Advances in the availability and analysis of RWD have 
increased the potential for generating robust RWE to support FDA 
regulatory decisions.\9\ FDA continues to work to expand the use of 
fit-for-purpose RWD to generate RWE in regulatory decision-making 
regarding medical product effectiveness. RWE has even supported some 
approvals of applications meeting evidentiary standards. FDA has also 
published a series of foundational draft guidances regarding the use of 
RWD, including assessing whether RWD, such as registries, are fit for 
use. These foundational guidances will be followed by further guidance 
on clinical trial and other study designs using RWD. For this type of 
information to be useful in achieving the goal of generating and using 
RWE and RWD for personalized medicine, the data must be of high 
quality. Increased budget authority for FDA would create a more 
reliable source of funding for FDA's activities that strengthen 
programs focused on improving the quality of RWE and RWD.

 fostering digital health technologies and artificial intelligence (ai)
    CDRH launched the Digital Health Center of Excellence (DHCoE) to 
help both FDA staff and external stakeholders advance the development 
and FDA review of digital health technologies.\10\ The DHCoE is focused 
in multiple areas including AI and machine learning (ML). AI/ML 
technologies have the potential to transform health care by deriving 
new and important insights from the vast amount of data generated 
during the delivery of health care every day.\11\ Digital health and AI 
are becoming increasingly important for personalized medicine as 
patients assume a larger role in managing their own health care and are 
more informed by their ability to access data about their unique 
biology. Additional appropriated resources would enable FDA to continue 
developing training programs to clarify regulatory pathways for 
internal FDA and external digital health stakeholders through the 
DHCoE. They would also strengthen the agency's partnerships focused on 
AI/ML and wearable technology, software, and patient-generated health 
data. Activities in these areas will help patients achieve their goals 
of getting high quality digital health technologies to patients.

    PMC appreciates the opportunity to highlight FDA's importance to 
the continued success of personalized medicine. A budget authority 
appropriation for FDA in fiscal Year 2024 of $3.914 billion will help 
the agency chart an efficient path for advancing innovative medical 
product development and bring us closer to a future in which every 
patient benefits from a personalized approach to health care.

President, Public Policy, Personalized Medicine Coalition.]
                                 ______
                                 
         Prepared Statement of Pet and Women Safety Act (PAWS)
    The Pet and Women Safety Act (PAWS) Coalition, a group of 
organizations working together in support of domestic violence 
survivors and their pets, strongly supports continued appropriations 
for the Emergency and Transitional Pet Shelter and Housing Assistance 
Grant Program. Together, we call on Congress to fund the program at the 
fully authorized amount of $3,000,000.
    PAWS Act legislation was included in the 2018 Farm Bill (Section 
12502), establishing this important grant program to support domestic 
violence shelters as they help survivors and their pets safely seek 
shelter when leaving an abuser. These grants provide emergency and 
transitional shelter and housing assistance or short-term shelter and 
housing assistance. Grants awarded may also be used for programs that 
enable a survivor to locate and secure safe housing with their pet, 
safe boarding for their pet, or related services such as transportation 
and other assistance. In 2023, funding will provide training and 
technical assistance to existing grantees from fiscal Year 2020-2022. 
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Victims of Crime (OVC) 
is now in its third year of administering this program, and demand for 
this funding is high.
    The $3.3 million appropriated for 2023 follows the success of the 
fiscal Year 2020, fiscal Year 2021, and fiscal Year 2022 Emergency 
Transitional Pet Shelter Housing and Assistance Grant Programs, which 
awarded approximately $2 million to six organizations in six States 
across the Nation in 2020, a total of $2.42 million to five 
organizations in 2021, and a total of $2.7 million to 12 organizations 
in 2022. Grants have enabled shelters to expand housing and supportive 
service resources for domestic violence survivors, provide assistance 
including rent, pet deposits, and pet supplies to those seeking 
transitional housing with their pet, and more. Each year, the PAWS Act 
Coalition has worked to raise awareness among the domestic violence 
shelter community of the availability of this important funding.
    PAWS Act Coalition members are also contributing funds and 
volunteer hours to the cause of making more domestic violence shelters 
pet-friendly. For example, in 2022 alone, Purina and RedRover awarded 
nine additional Purple Leash Project grants to domestic violence 
shelters across the country in need. These grants provide funding and 
resources to transform domestic violence emergency shelters into safe 
spaces for survivors and their pets. Shelters can use the grant money 
to complete renovations and upgrades to their survivor services 
offerings that will allow people and pets to escape abuse and heal 
together. The success of this program demonstrates that smaller-size 
grants can still have a big impact. Purple Leash Project grants 
typically range between $20,000 and $50,000 each. Since founding the 
Purple Leash Project, Purina and RedRover have provided 34 grants 
totaling more than $700,000 in funding to domestic violence shelters 
across the United States. Since 2012, RedRover has awarded 185 Safe 
Housing grants to domestic violence shelters in 46 States to help them 
become pet-friendly, and the majority of these grants are less than 
$20,000. Purina and RedRover are working towards the goal of helping 25 
percent of U.S. domestic violence shelters to become pet-friendly by 
the end of 2025. While these public-private partnerships are hugely 
important, fully funding the PAWS Act grant program will help to 
address the widespread need for funding to support similar programs 
across the country.
    The PAWS Act Coalition is grateful to have had the opportunity to 
meet with the DOJ OVC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to 
discuss the grant program and offer constructive feedback. 
Specifically, the Coalition encouraged the USDA and the DOJ to consider 
providing a greater number of grants at lesser dollar amounts in 2021, 
with the intention of filling a gap in funding resources and helping 
more shelters become pet-friendly, especially those that are smaller 
and more rural. In response, the fiscal Year 2022 and fiscal Year 2023 
Grant Programs include small awards designed for shelters and other 
transitional housing services for DV survivors and their pets that may 
only be seeking funding for smaller purchases such as kennels, crates, 
pet supplies, beds and other items that may be necessary to housing 
survivors and pets together.
    Funding the Emergency and Transitional Pet Shelter and Housing 
Assistance Grant Program at $3 million is essential to saving the lives 
of people and pets. According to the Centers for Disease Control, about 
1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men have experienced physical violence by an 
intimate partner within their lifetime and over 61 million women and 53 
million men have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate 
partner in their lifetime.\1\ More than 10 million U.S. adults 
experience domestic violence annually. On a typical day, there are more 
than 19,000 phone calls placed to domestic violence hotlines 
nationwide.\2\

    There remains a critical need for shelter options that accommodate 
pets. According to a recent nationwide survey of 2,500 domestic 
violence survivors commissioned by the Urban Resource Institute (URI) 
and the National Domestic Violence Hotline, 50 percent of respondents 
reported that they would not consider shelter for themselves if they 
could not take their pets with them. Ninety-seven percent of 
respondents said that keeping their pets with them is an important 
factor in deciding whether or not to seek shelter. Ninety-one percent 
of respondents indicated that their pets' emotional support and 
physical protection are significant in their ability to survive and 
heal. Further, 48 percent reported the threat of harm to pets was a 
worry and 37 percent reported their abuser had threatened to harm or 
kill a pet.\3\

    A growing body of science has demonstrated a link between domestic 
violence and animal cruelty\4\. An outlet of emotional support for 
survivors, the family pet often becomes a target for physical abuse.\5\ 
In studies that have explored the role of companion animals in an 
abusive relationship, companion animals are used by abusers to control, 
hurt, and intimidate their partners.\6\

    Research demonstrates the link between pets and improvements in 
mental health, particularly for those who have experienced trauma. 
Companion animals often serve as a much needed and effective outlet for 
overcoming abuse, and have also been shown to improve mental health 
conditions such as depression, stress and anxiety, all of which can 
manifest from intimate partner violence.\7\ The pervasiveness of 
domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic and the incidence of 
violence towards pets in the United States shows the urgency of 
providing safe shelter for survivors and their pets.

    The need for additional pet-friendly options for domestic violence 
survivors remains an under-addressed, critical issue facing our 
country. The continuation of the Emergency and Transitional Pet Shelter 
Housing and Assistance Grant Program funding is an important step to 
meet this need. Please support Federal funding in fiscal Year 2024 for 
the PAWS Act grant program to the fully authorized amount of $3 million 
so that no survivor of domestic violence will have to choose between 
their own safety or the safety of their pets.
    The PAWS Act Coalition is counting on your strong support for the 
Emergency and Transitional Pet Shelter Housing and Assistance Grant 
Program. Together, we can protect survivors of domestic violence by 
protecting the animals they rely on for comfort and healing.

                 Prepared Statement of Research!America
    On behalf of Research!America, thank you for this opportunity to 
submit testimony on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations for Fiscal Year 
2024 (FY24). Research!America is a non-profit, non-partisan advocacy 
alliance. Our more than 300 organizational members work to elevate the 
priority assigned to speeding the pace of medical and public health 
progress.
    The FDA plays a critical role in ensuring public health and safety 
through oversight of drugs, biologics, medical devices, food, and 
cosmetics. In the interest of the continued protection and advancement 
of our Nation's health, we request that the Committee allocate $3.963 
billion for the FDA in FY24, an increase of $420 million over FY23.
                    the food and drug administration
    The FDA is the oldest consumer protection agency in the U.S. and 
has overseen an extensive catalog of consumer products for over a 
century. An estimated $2.7 trillion in food, medical, and tobacco 
products are currently regulated under the purview of the FDA, 
constituting nearly 20 percent of every dollar spent by U.S. consumers. 
The FDA oversees more than $360 billion in imports and $245 billion in 
exports annually, and monitors more than 270,000 facilities producing 
drugs, food, biologics, and devices. Furthermore, the FDA regulates 
nearly 80 percent of the U.S. food supply.
    Robust funding for the FDA is critical to ensuring the agency can 
perform its critical responsibilities with rigor and efficiency. In 
FY21, over $3 billion of the FDA's $6.1 billion budget was spent in 
programs evaluating the safety and effectiveness of human drugs, 
biologics, medical devices, and radiological technology. An additional 
$1.1 billion was spent in programs that regulate foods. Considering the 
expansive scope of FDA oversight, it is not a reach to say that every 
household in the U.S. contains food, medical, and/or cosmetic products 
that were evaluated for safety and efficacy by the agency.
    The need for increased funding reflects both the growing demands on 
the agency and the growing complexity of those demands. We are in a 
period of unimagined medical progress, epitomized by gene therapy, 
immunology, the expanding use of digital technologies, and artificial 
intelligence applications. FDA clearly needs additional funding to 
fulfill its key role in assuring these developments translate into safe 
and effective advances benefiting the American people, while assuring 
ongoing rigor and effectiveness across its other responsibilities.
    Given the pivotal role the FDA plays in our public health system 
and economy, and the increasing scope and complexity of its oversight 
responsibilities, we believe it is vastly in the Nation's best 
interests to increase its budget by at least $420 million in FY24. 
Thank you for considering our testimony, and for your efforts, and 
those of your respective staff members, on behalf of us all.

    Prepared Statement of the Sustainable Agriculture Research and 
                               Education
    Thank you for the opportunity to present our fiscal year 2024 
funding requests. We appreciate your work on the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2023, which addressed many of our priorities for 
FY23. On behalf of our member organizations from around the country, we 
submit the following requests for the Department of Agriculture. These 
requests are listed in the order they typically appear in the 
appropriations bill.
               national institute of food and agriculture
         sustainable agriculture research and education program
    For over 30 years, the Sustainable Agriculture Research and 
Education (SARE) program has been a leader in addressing key 
sustainability and profitability challenges facing agriculture. As 
USDA's only farmer-driven research program, SARE has helped create more 
innovative farm practices that are actually adopted by farmers on the 
ground than any other competitive research program. SARE is also 
expanding outreach to historically underserved farmers and ranchers by 
providing funds to support education and training. Investing in 
agriculture research is a win for taxpayers too: every dollar invested 
in public research generates $20 in economic activity.
    Since the program launched, SARE has awarded over $377 million to 
over 8,300 initiatives focused on farmer-driven research and education 
efforts in every State across the country. Despite SARE's long-standing 
record of helping farmers and ranchers develop and adopt innovative 
practices and systems, the program has not reached its full authorized 
amount of $60 million. As a result, USDA can only fund a fraction of 
eligible proposals submitted each year. To meet future challenges, 
farmers need research that is accessible and relevant to their farms. 
We therefore urge Congress to provide full funding for SARE at its 
authorized level of $60 million, mirroring the President's Budget 
Request for FY24. This funding will allow SARE to continue supporting 
research at land grant universities, accessible and practical 
information for farmers, resources tailored to underserved farmers, 
farm-based resilience to climate change, and thriving rural 
communities.
                  organic transitions initiative (org)
    The Organic Transitions Research, Education, and Extension program 
(ORG) helps farmers fill knowledge gaps and overcome barriers in 
successfully transitioning to organic farming. For nearly 20 years, ORG 
has invested $44 million in over 90 projects to develop and implement 
research and education programs to improve the competitiveness of 
organic and transitioning-to-organic livestock and crop producers. By 
providing critical funding to colleges and universities conducting 
organic farming research, ORG also helps farmers better understand the 
economic and environmental benefits of organic farming.
    Since the 1990s, the organic market has grown into a multi-billion-
dollar industry. Despite this growth, total USDA investment in organic 
research remains below 2 percent of its annual research budget, far 
short of the 6 percent market share of organic products in the US. 
Given the growth of the organic sector and the continued demand for 
support to organic farmers, investment in the ORG program must increase 
to keep pace with this need. We therefore urge Congress to provide $10 
million in discretionary funding in FY24 for the Organic Transitions 
Program.
 agricultural marketing service and rural business--cooperative service
                    local agriculture market program
    The Local Agriculture Market Program (LAMP) serves as an umbrella 
program for the Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program 
(FMLFPP) and the Value-Added Producers Grant Program (VAPG). Through 
these programs, USDA has invested in the physical infrastructure, 
training, and relationship development necessary to expand local and 
regional supply chains. These investments provided significant return 
when the pandemic and other recent supply chain disruptions upended our 
food system. LAMP helped ensure that infrastructure and relationships 
were in place to enable local and regional food distribution networks 
to fill critical supply chain gaps and provide for the most vulnerable 
in our communities.
    VAPG offers grants to farmers and ranchers who are developing farm 
and food businesses to manage risk and boost income, create jobs, and 
support regional supply chains in rural America. A recent Economic 
Research Service report shows that businesses that received VAPGs were 
89 percent less likely to fail 2 years after the grant compared to 
similar businesses that did not receive support through the program.
    FMLFPP is a competitive grants program that funds direct-to-
consumer marketing and local businesses that act as intermediaries 
between producers and consumers by aggregating, storing, processing, 
and distributing local or regional food. Since 2006, FMLFPP and its 
predecessor program have invested over $250 million in strengthening 
local and regional food systems in every State in the country. Despite 
a long and successful track record and interest in local and regional 
markets and value-added products, funding for both of these programs is 
only a fraction of what is needed to meet demand. Therefore, we support 
the President's Budget Request of $16 million in discretionary funding 
for VAPG and $7.5 million in discretionary funding for FMLFPP for FY24.
             natural resources conservation service (nrcs)
 conservation technical assistance and the grazing lands conservation 
                               initiative
    Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA), a subset of Conservation 
Operations, is the backbone of USDA's conservation programs. Through 
CTA, NRCS field staff work with farmers to develop and implement 
conservation plans to steward resources, assess conservation practices 
on farms, fulfill conservation compliance requirements, and collect and 
disseminate data on the Nation's natural resources. This funding is 
critical to help producers develop site-specific plans to conserve 
water, prepare for extreme weather, and address natural resource 
concerns on their land. CTA funding can also support NRCS efforts to 
provide technical assistance to farmers and ranchers interested in 
improving their grazing operations.
    Grazing-based farm and ranch operations improve profitability for 
producers across the Nation. Grass-based agriculture is an important 
strategy for introducing new farmers and ranchers into livestock 
management because they can be low upfront-capital operations that 
nonetheless generate good income. Well managed grazing of livestock can 
help new and established farmers and ranchers alike thrive and stay in 
their rural communities. Effectively managed grasslands also protect 
water quality, improve soil health, and provide a good habitat for 
pollinators and wildlife.
    Whether it is one-to-one technical assistance focused on grazing or 
the development of conservation plans for an individual farm, on-the-
ground capacity at NRCS continues to be a limiting factor for 
conservation implementation, and an increased investment in CTA 
(including GLCI) will give NRCS the ability to truly build local 
capacity, leading to improved conservation and resource management. To 
ensure that CTA has the resources needed to help producers implement 
the conservation practices that are essential to mitigating climate 
change, we urge Congress to provide $1.1 billion for CTA, with $30 
million of that specifically dedicated to GLCI.
         office of urban agriculture and innovative production
    The 2018 Farm Bill authorized the creation of the Office of Urban 
Agriculture and Innovative Production (the Office), whose mission is to 
encourage and promote urban, indoor, and other innovative agricultural 
practices. While the name implies a restriction to urban areas, urban 
agriculture broadly covers a variety of growing techniques that lend 
themselves to urban environments but have been adopted in both suburban 
and rural areas. The Office promotes a wide variety of practices 
including community gardens, outdoor vertical production, greenhouses, 
indoor farms, and hydroponic facilities.
    The Office received funding for the first time in FY20 to implement 
its authorities. Since FY20, funding has been utilized to pilot an 
advisory committee for the Office and USDA, a competitive grants 
program, a Community Compost and Food Waste Reduction cooperative 
agreement program, and 17 urban and suburban Farm Service Agency (FSA) 
County Committees. Both the competitive grants and food waste reduction 
cooperative agreements have garnered interest far beyond available 
funding. In fiscal year 2021 alone, the Office awarded $6.6 million in 
grants and cooperative agreements, $4.75 million for 10 Planning 
Projects and 11 Implementation Projects, and $1.92 million in 24 
compost cooperative agreements.
    Due to overwhelming interest, especially from farmers of color 
frequently operating in urban areas, we urge Congress to fully fund the 
Office of Urban Agriculture at the authorized level of $25 million in 
FY24 so that it has sufficient resources to meet the demand of a 
growing farming sector and expand beyond initial pilot States.
office of partnerships and public engagement and national institute of 
                          food and agriculture
          farming opportunities training and outreach program
    The 2018 Farm Bill created the Farming Opportunities Training and 
Outreach (FOTO) program to strengthen USDA's efforts to train and 
assist beginning, veteran, Tribal and other underserved farmers. FOTO 
combines two of USDA's flagship training and technical assistance 
programs: the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program (BFRDP) 
and the Outreach and Assistance to Socially Disadvantaged and Veteran 
Farmers and Ranchers Program (aka ``Section 2501'').
    Since 1990, the 2501 Program has been the only program investing 
millions of dollars to reverse disadvantages and disparities that have 
faced our Nation's military veterans and minority farmers by providing 
tools they need to thrive in today's agricultural economy. For over a 
decade, BFRDP has been the only Federal program exclusively dedicated 
to training new farmers and ranchers and has invested over $176 million 
in grants to ensure they have the skills to start successful farms. 
Both programs have funded academic institutions, extension services, 
and community organizations to support and train farmers and ranchers. 
Ensuring the success of minority farmers, veteran farmers, and new and 
beginning farmers through technical assistance and other resources is 
critical to the continued success of a new generation of American 
agriculture. Therefore, we urge Congress to provide $10 million in 
discretionary funding in FY24 for the Farming Opportunities Training 
and Outreach Program, split equally between BFRDP and 2501.
                           general provisions
              packers and stockyards act rulemaking riders
    The Packers and Stockyards Act (PSA) was passed a century ago to 
combat anticompetitive practices in the livestock and poultry 
industries as corporate meatpackers and processors consolidated and 
amassed power over producers. From authority given in the 2008 Farm 
Bill, USDA published a set of proposed regulations to strengthen PSA 
enforcement and received over 61,000 comments largely in support of the 
rules. However, livestock and poultry companies lobbied Congress to use 
the annual appropriations process to block USDA from finalizing the 
rules, known as ``GIPSA'' rules. As a result, the annual agriculture 
appropriations bill for FY2012-2015 included ``GIPSA riders'' to block 
USDA from implementing the rules and, in some cases, to require USDA to 
rescind rules that had been finalized.
    Since June 2022, USDA has released two rules to strengthen PSA: the 
Transparency in Poultry Growing Contracts and Tournaments rule, and the 
Inclusive Competition and Market Integrity rule--while a third rule is 
still anticipated. It is critical that USDA is allowed to implement 
these pro-competition rules to protect producers and consumers alike 
from unfair and anticompetitive practices in agricultural markets These 
reforms cannot happen if appropriations riders block them. As such, we 
urge appropriators to not include any general provision blocking the 
USDA from finalizing the PSA fair competition rules.

             Prepared Statement of Spark Climate Solutions
    In this testimony, Spark Climate Solutions, a nonprofit 
organization, urges the Senate to invest in research and development to 
increase livestock productivity and significantly reduce livestock 
enteric methane emissions. We must also modernize regulatory processes 
to evaluate, and where appropriate, approve, new solutions that will 
keep American producers globally competitive while working towards 
climate goals. Near-term action is needed to achieve this goal by 
funding research and development of new solutions, producer education, 
regulatory innovation, and targeted incentives.
    In 2023 the USDA's Agriculture Food & Research Institute is funding 
$5,000,000 in competitive grants for livestock enteric methane 
emissions research. We recommend increasing USDA-AFRI's funding in 2024 
to expand this program. We also recommend that Hatch funding, NIFA 
Animal Health and Disease, USDA Equipment Grants, USDA-ARS and other 
competitive and capacity funding be appropriated towards achieving this 
goal.
    Agriculture emits 36 percent of United States methane emissions, 
more than that leaked from U.S. fossil fuel infrastructure.\1\ While a 
significant amount of these emissions come from manure, 70 percent of 
agriculture methane comes from cattle as methane exhaled from cattle 
from a process called ``enteric fermentation.'' \2\ Remediating 
livestock enteric methane emissions represents an opportunity to reduce 
the US greenhouse gas footprint by 3 percent. Because the enteric 
methane comes from the calories in the feed being used inefficiently, 
this could simultaneously potentially improve cattle productivity by up 
to 6 percent. Currently available solutions can address, at most, about 
10 percent of US enteric emissions, and not all of those solutions are 
yet approved to be used by American producers, while they have been 
approved for major livestock competitors in Brazil, Australia, Europe 
and other agricultural export nations.\3\ And we need to find new 
solutions for the remaining majority of emissions. As methane is an 
unproductive byproduct of ruminant digestion, research and development 
should prioritize enhanced productivity that simultaneously reduces 
emissions. Yet over the last 5 years, the US Federal Government has 
spent less than estimated $5,000,000 per year on research and 
development in this area, very low in light of the high potential 
climate and productivity impact, compared to other agricultural 
research areas.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Lowering enteric methane emissions would help bolster U.S. 
agricultural leadership and export competitiveness. To that end, we 
recommend investing in building regulatory pathways that are ready to 
make informed decisions about new solutions coming on the market and 
authorizing and appropriating $82,000,000 per year to a US Department 
of Agriculture enteric emissions research and innovation program which 
would advance solutions that could easily drop into existing farm 
practices and convert avoided methane into increased milk and meat 
production. We set out the justification for this amount below, which 
can be addressed by a combination of authorizations and appropriations.
                        challenge & opportunity
    Cattle and other ruminants digest their food via anaerobic (oxygen-
free) fermentation. This allows them to digest roughage such as grasses 
and other forage and transform it into meat and milk. But it also 
generates methane. Cattle release on average 6 percent of the calories 
they eat as methane, a substantial loss in their potential meat and 
milk productivity. This methane is in addition to the methane emitted 
by their manure.
    An invisible and odorless gas, methane is a powerful greenhouse gas 
that is responsible for 0.5C of the 1C of modern global warming 
(based on the 2010-2019 average).\5\ One-third of U.S. anthropogenic 
methane emissions come from cattle and other ruminants. Solutions may 
be able to be developed that both disrupt enteric methane production 
while also increasing cattle productivity. That would help reduce 
global temperatures and provide benefits for both producers and 
consumers. Currently, there are a few tested and marketable solutions 
that use chemicals to disrupt methane-creating microbes in the cattle's 
first stomach (the rumen). These are important solutions that need to 
be evaluated for regulatory approval. However, additional research and 
development must also be done, to help address the majority of 
emissions that don't yet have available solutions, particularly from 
cattle grazing in pastures. Additional work is also needed to continue 
developing solutions that consistently lead to a productivity benefit. 
Focused scientific research could deepen our understanding of cattle 
metabolism, and advance new solutions for reducing enteric methane 
further.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/figures/summary-for-
policymakers/figure-spm-2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Progress on this front also requires improved research tools to 
measure how much methane cattle breathe out burp and relate these 
methane emissions to their productivity and intake of feed and forage. 
Access to such research tools enables researchers and innovators to 
develop and evaluate new solutions. We know that methane emissions 
rates vary widely between cattle on the same farm of the same breed, as 
well as across breeds. Currently these tools are expensive and not 
widely available, for example the primary tool available measures 
thirty cattle per day, costs $100,000, and can be found at only a 
handful of research institutions. That presents a practical problem of 
access not only for producers but also for non-specialist scientific 
innovators. Making those tools more accessible, for example via fee-
for-service centers at leading US Land Grant institutes, would make 
them more affordable for producers and researchers. That would help 
unlock the creativity of US innovators, and provide evidence that their 
solutions really work for producers, and are having positive climate 
impact.
    Even when new solutions are found and proven, innovators still face 
a 10-year FDA approval process. This is uncompetitive and restrictive 
compared to other countries. Since much faster approval is possible in 
Australia, Brazil, and Europe, innovators have an incentive to launch 
their products and build their businesses there rather than in the USA. 
And as climate-aware export markets develop, slow FDA approval will 
cost US producers market share and market opportunity. We therefore 
recommend that the FDA be given authority and direction to evaluate new 
methane-reducing products for safety on an accelerated timeline, while 
maintaining critical human and animal safety standards. This would help 
the US position itself as a global leader in a potential multi-billion 
dollar market while upholding its climate commitments.
    To achieve these goals, we propose the following steps:
        fund basic & applied livestock enteric methane research
    Developing science-based, effective livestock enteric methane 
solution depends on a detailed understanding of cattle microbiology as 
well as practical understanding of what makes solutions easy to adopt. 
Increasing funding for basic and applied research could accelerate 
development of new methods, and rapidly build a portfolio of scalable 
potential solutions. We recommend that within USDA-NIFA, that AFRI, 
Hatch, Animal Health and Disease, and other competitive and capacity 
funding be appropriated to:
  --Basic research in livestock methane microbiology, to create a 
        knowledge base that will support development of new win-win 
        solutions.

  --Applied livestock methane solutions research, simultaneously 
        prioritizing productivity and methane reduction solutions, that 
        could be administered in a long-duration (e.g. once per year) 
        product formulation compatible with grazing cattle. Such 
        technology already exists for cattle nutrition and disease 
        prevention\6\.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ https://www.natual-techna.com/en/bolus-bovine-ovine-goat

  --Surveys and other social science research to understand barriers 
        and opportunities for implementation, with the goal of finding 
        simple, inexpensive ways American producers and ranchers can 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        implement new solutions.

    Funds Needed: $50,000,000 per year

    Congress should also include report language urging USDA to 
increase funding for enteric methane within the Division of Animal 
Systems, for example:
    Enteric Methane Innovation.-The Committee recognizes the 
innovations that increased public research on enteric methane could 
make possible. The Committee encourages AFRI to make the advancement of 
enteric fermentation solutions, such as cattle feed additives, methane-
inhibiting vaccines, and breeding for low-methane cattle, a distinct 
research priority.
 create public fee-for-service testing facilities for livestock methane
    Access to methane test facilities, from the laboratory to the dairy 
barn, is a bottleneck. It limits how many innovative ideas for 
solutions can be tested. Only a small number of institutions worldwide 
have the tools needed to test methane, and outside access to those 
tools is limited. We recommend funding be appropriated for innovation-
enabling research infrastructure to USDA-ARS and USDA-NIFA, through 
USDA Equipment Grants and USDA-AFRI. This funding would:

  --Establish a nationwide network of fee-for-access livestock methane 
        research facilities, equipped with research measurement 
        equipment and technical staff. US Land Grant universities 
        already possess the necessary research cattle management 
        expertise. Joint investment with them and partial support from 
        research users would quickly resolve access issues and help 
        make the US an international leader in livestock methane 
        research.

  --Develop a USDA-ARS national center for pre-livestock testing and 
        screening of potential products, which would serve as a user 
        facility, accessible to scientists in many fields. Specialized 
        cattle researchers shouldn't be the only ones who can test new 
        ideas for reducing livestock enteric methane. Accessible 
        facilities could unlock innovation from the leading U.S. 
        biology researchers.

    US Department of Energy national labs have successful user 
facilities which could serve as a model. For example, the National 
Renewable Energy Lab leads standard-setting and validation for high-
efficiency solar energy technology. New Zealand's AgResearch is another 
model. It has a grant-accessible anti-methane rapid testing facility 
and it recently developed a breed of sheep with 10 percent reduced 
methane emissions and higher productivity.
    Funds Needed: $15,000,000 per year
   fund development of low-cost cattle methane measurement technology
    What can be measured can guide innovation and management, and what 
we measure easily and consistently, we improve. Producers measure milk 
production on every cow every day and we've seen this lead to a 300 
percent productivity increase since 1950. But producers and most 
researchers do not measure livestock methane production. Livestock 
methane measurement equipment currently costs about $100,000 for a 
system that measures 30-40 cattle a day. We recommend that within USDA-
NIFA, that AFRI, Hatch, Animal Health and Disease, and other 
competitive and capacity funding be appropriated to:
  --Develop lower-cost measurement systems, so every research barn can 
        afford to measure livestock methane. US Land Grant universities 
        have over 10,000 research cattle. Equipped with measurement 
        systems, they could all provide livestock methane research 
        data.

  --Develop farm-integrable measurement systems that make methane 
        emissions visible to US producers, enabling them to experiment 
        and innovate. Methane is a loss for livestock production. If 
        producers can see it, they'll work to decrease methane and 
        improve their bottom line.

    A $15 million annual budget for technological development might 
lead to rapid improvements in measuring equipment systems. A portion of 
this could fund interdisciplinary projects that bring engineers from 
across industry and livestock experts together. Another portion could 
be framed as a grand challenge to achieve cost and performance targets 
connected to a government procurement market-shaping program.
    Funds Needed: $15,000,000 per year
    direct the fda to create a new regulatory category and team for 
                  climate-positive livestock products
    Current anti-methane feed additives are regulated as drugs, 
requiring a ten-year approval process. As European export markets 
increasingly regulate emissions, this may lead to a lack of 
competitiveness for US products. To address this, Congress should 
create a special FDA category with a dedicated team for climate-
positive livestock products, with appropriate funding to resource the 
team and infrastructure necessary to achieve the goals of robustly 
evaluating new anti-methane solutions for safety and efficacy, and 
making new solutions available to US farmers if safe and effective.

             Prepared Statement of Spark Climate Solutions
    In this testimony, which I am submitting on behalf of Spark Climate 
Solutions, a non-profit organization, I urge the Senate to invest in 
research, development and best management practice adoption to 
modernize soil management and fertilizer usage, leading to improved 
crop productivity, further climate resilience, and increased resilience 
to global fertilizer shortages.
    Building and maintaining soil organic matter is widely viewed as 
beneficial for multiple reasons, including provisioning of nutrients 
for crop productivity, improving soil aeration and water holding 
capacity, maintaining habitat for beneficial soil microorganisms, 
sequestering carbon, and retaining nitrogen and phosphorus. Proper soil 
management that retains nutrients not only improves crop productivity, 
but also reduces harmful soil erosion and nutrient runoff and reduces 
emissions of the potent greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (N2O). Here we 
present recommendations to address the multiple goals of improving soil 
quality for crop production, sequestering carbon, retaining nitrogen, 
and reducing N2O emissions.
    Spark would recommend the following guidelines for investments in 
advancing these objectives regarding carbon gains and avoiding nitrogen 
losses, including nitrous oxide (N2O), whether applied to spending 
authorization of activities indicated in the IRA and other existing 
programs, or new authorizations under the 2023 Farm Bill:
    1. Both carbon sequestration and nitrogen retention (resulting in 
lower nitrogen losses and lower N2O emissions) should be promoted with 
incentives for farmers to adopt best management practices (BMPs). 
Increased funding for programs such as USDA's Environmental Quality 
Incentives Program (EQIP) and Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) 
would promote adoption of BMPs including:

  --Developing and updating nutrient management plans

  --Planting cover crops for the non-growing season

  --Spring rather than fall application of fertilizers

  --Split application of smaller doses of fertilizers during the 
        growing season

  --Conservation tillage practices that are appropriate for each 
        region's crops, soils, and climate

  --Using enhanced efficiency fertilizers and inhibitors of urease and 
        nitrification

  --Experimenting with multi-cropping

  --Experimenting with re-integrating livestock and crop production 
        systems

    2. Incentive programs should focus on adoption of these BMPs rather 
than verification of the specific effects at the farm scale. BMP 
adoption is relatively easy to verify with a combination of satellite 
imagery, drone overflights, brief on-site visits, and farmer self-
reporting. While verifying the benefits of these BMPs for carbon 
sequestration, reduced nitrate runoff, and reduced N2O emissions may 
not be feasible or affordable at the individual farm scale, in the 
aggregate, widespread BMP adoption will yield these benefits at larger 
scales. Unless and until monitoring, reporting, and validation (MRV) of 
soil carbon credits at the farm scale can meet more rigorous standards, 
incentives and outreach to encourage BMP adoption will be a more 
effective policy approach to increasing soil carbon sequestration and 
reducing nitrogen losses and N2O emissions. Additional research should 
be funded to quantify average environmental benefits of BMPs by soil 
type, climate, and crop. The Long-Term Agricultural Research (LTAR) 
network within USDA-ARS would be well suited to conduct this research. 
It should be authorized and its annual funding increased to $42m. This 
research will enable BMP impacts on environmental outcomes to be 
evaluated at the regional scale.
    3. USDA should be tasked and funded to harmonize and coordinate MRV 
requirements for the rapidly emerging markets for carbon credits in 
agricultural soils. These markets already have considerable momentum 
but lack rigor and consistency-guidance that USDA could help provide. 
Regional Climate Hubs should be authorized and the budget increased to 
$30M annually to develop and share resources related to MRV 
requirements and tools.
    4. Funding should be increased for social science studies to better 
understand why farmers choose to accept or decline incentive programs 
to adopt BMPs or to participate in soil carbon credit programs. Farmer 
decision making is not confined only to the influences of agronomic 
advice and economic benefits, but is also influenced by numerous social 
factors, such as education, tradition, trusted sources of information 
from family or crop advisors, risk aversion, etc. These factors are 
poorly understood due to insufficient funding of social science 
research in agronomy. It's urgent to close this research gap. The 
Economic Research Service (ERS) currently hosts most of USDA's economic 
research, but we believe that basic social science research should be 
added to the remit of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture 
(NIFA), with funding of $10M per year for basic socio-economic research 
on farmer decision making regarding adoption of BMPs. Funding for R&D, 
including agronomic, economic, or social science research, should 
emphasize farmer participation and follow emerging principles of 
stakeholder engagement in convergent science. Farmers have knowledge 
and experience that can help inform the design, implementation, and 
analysis of research. Their participation in all stages of research 
also improves the probability they will buy into the resulting 
recommendations.
    5. Additional R&D funding is needed for medium-to-long-term efforts 
toward decoupling food production from intensive use of nitrogen 
amendments. This will require significant advanced research and 
transformative innovation of our food production system, which is the 
objective of the Agriculture Advanced Research and Development 
Authority (AgARDA; a ``DARPA-style'' approach to transformative 
technological innovation). The current suite of BMPs promoting the 
``4Rs'' of nutrient stewardship (the right form, right time, right 
amount, and right place of fertilizers applications) are helpful and 
worthy of continued support. But their incremental improvements in 
nitrogen use efficiency have been insufficient to reduce total nitrogen 
pollution as agricultural productivity increases in response to growing 
food demand. Therefore, longer-term, innovative and transformative 
solutions should be promoted through funding appropriation to AGARDA at 
the currently authorized level of $50M/yr, with increases in both 
authorization and appropriations to at least $200M/yr, to pursue 
innovations in the topics listed below, among many other important 
agricultural innovation priorities. In addition, USDA should establish 
new centers of excellence for research on each of these topics:

  --Developing decentralized green ammonia production (using renewable 
        energy to produce the hydrogen used for ammonia synthesis). 
        This would provide farmers with reliable, year-round access to 
        fertilizers so that applications could be more closely matched 
        and optimized with crop growth.

  --Expanding direct feeding of livestock with synthetic nitrogen, 
        including urea, nitrate, and synthetic amino acids, so that 
        less cropland and less fertilizer are needed to nourish 
        livestock (e.g., less soybean and alfalfa and lower nitrogen 
        concentrations in grains like corn)

  --New efforts in crop breeding to enable crops to grow further into 
        cold seasons (thus remaining sinks for soil nitrogen for a 
        longer period), internal recycling of nitrogen within crop 
        plants, nitrogen concentrations of grain that are optimized for 
        specific markets, production of natural nitrification 
        inhibitors, and perennialization of grain crops.

               Prepared Statement of Squaxin Island Tribe
    On behalf of the Tribal Leadership and citizens of the Squaxin 
Island Tribe, I am honored to submit written testimony on our annual 
budget priorities for the fiscal Year 2024 Appropriations for the 
Department of Agriculture funding for Tribal Programs in Rural 
Development and the Food and Nutrition Service. The Squaxin Island 
Tribe requests that all Tribal program funding throughout the Federal 
Government be exempt from future sequestrations, rescissions, and 
disproportionate cuts.

TRIBAL SPECIAL REQUEST

1. Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) 
Demonstration Project--Increase funding to expand the number of Tribes 
participating--Squaxin Island Tribe requests to participate--Food 
Nutrition Service

NATIONAL AND REGIONAL REQUESTS

1. Permanent authority for the 638 FDPIR Demonstration Project
2. Support efforts to Fulfill U.S. Trust Responsibility to Indian 
Tribes in the Stewardship of Federal Lands and Waters
3. $2.0 Million--Rural Development Technical Assistance Program
4. Support the requests of the National Congress of American Indians 
(NCAI) and the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians (ATNI)
                    squaxin island tribe background
    We are native people of South Puget Sound and descendants of the 
maritime people who lived and prospered along these shores for untold 
centuries. We are known as the People of the Water because of our 
strong cultural connection to the natural beauty and bounty of Puget 
Sound going back hundreds of years. The Squaxin Island Indian 
Reservation is in southeastern Mason County, Washington and the Tribe 
is a signatory to the 1854 Medicine Creek Treaty. Our treaty-designated 
reservation, Squaxin Island, is approximately 2.2 square miles of 
uninhabited forested land, surrounded by the bays and inlets of 
southern Puget Sound. Because the Island lacks fresh water, the Tribe 
has built its community on roughly 26 acres at Kamilche, Washington 
purchased and placed into trust. The Tribe also owns 6 acres across 
Pickering Passage from Squaxin Island and a plot of 36 acres on 
Harstine Island, across Peale Passage. The total land area including 
off-reservation trust lands is 1,715.46 acres. In addition, the Tribe 
manages roughly 500 acres of Puget Sound tidelands.
    Our Tribal governance combines our sovereign powers as well as U.S. 
Congressional acts related to treaties, statutes, and public law. 
Squaxin Island Tribe, like all Tribal Nations, continue to work through 
the impacts of the pandemic. Prior to COVID-19, the Tribal government 
and our economic enterprises constituted the largest employer in Mason 
County with over 1,250 employees. The Tribe has a current enrollment of 
1,040 and an on-reservation population of 426 living in 141 homes. 
Squaxin has an estimated service area population of 2,747; a growth 
rate of about 10 percent, and an unemployment rate of about 30 percent 
(according to the BIA Labor Force Report). We continue to need the 
assistance of Congressional relief funds to mitigate the ongoing 
challenges to recovery. We are grateful for the support we have 
received so far.
          squaxin island tribe specific request/justification:
                     the farm bill reauthorization
    The 2018 Farm Bill was a major bipartisan achievement that included 
an impressive Tribal agenda. It has been a catalyst for Tribal rural 
communities to advance food sovereignty and security, economic and 
workforce development initiatives, public health priorities, and rural 
broadband internet deployment just to name a few. The Squaxin Island 
Tribe is a self-determining, self-governing sovereign nation and for 
more than 35 years, we have administered programs, functions, services 
and activities that were previously assumed to be performed for our 
benefit by the Federal Government. We enjoy our autonomy but are 
limited by Self-Governance authority only in the Department of the 
Interior, Department of Health and Human Services and Department of 
Transportation. While the 2018 Farm Bill provided Tribes with 
unprecedented opportunities, the next version should build on the 
progress made to date and advance a Federal agricultural policy that 
incorporates our priorities and expands Self-Governance authority.
food distribution program on indian reservations (fdpir) demonstration 
project--increase funding to expand the number of tribes participating 
           and allow additional tribal goods on products list
    The Squaxin Island Tribe has been successfully operating programs, 
services, functions and activities previously performed by both the 
Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of 
Health and Human Services' Indian Health Service under 638 contracts 
and Self-Governance compacts for more than thirty-five years. We will 
be exploring options in the Department of Transportation under Self-
Governance soon.
    The USDA Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative has been operating 
since 2021. The ``Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations 
(FDPIR)'' demonstration project, is an initiative that allows Tribes to 
promote Traditional foods, agriculture markets and indigenous healthy 
foods tailored to American Indian and Alaska Native dietary needs. 
Tribes also market Tribal foods, support seed saving centers along with 
other traditional food practices. We are excited to see the FDPIR 
demonstration project in USDA and are anxious to explore how to expand 
the FDPIR products and get more seafood on the products list. Squaxin 
Island has many other seafood products, such as clams, oysters, salmon 
and geoducks, and we would like to have an opportunity to offer these 
additional products to the FDPIR products list.

                We ask this subcommittee to continue to invest in this 
                initiative and increase the funding that will allow 
                additional Tribes to participate in the 639 FDPIR 
                demonstration project and allow for other Tribal 
                practices to be showcased and support self-
                determination and self-government.

NATIONAL AND REGIONAL REQUESTS:

        1. Permanent authority for the 638 FDPIR Demonstration 
        Project--For nearly 35 years Tribes have operated programs 
        under the Self-Governance authority in the Indian Self-
        Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), that were 
        previously performed by Federal personnel. Tribes have improved 
        program administration, management and operations efficiently 
        and effectively for better delivery of services to our Tribal 
        citizens and within our communities. We ask that the Committee 
        continues to provide funding for the expansion of the 
        demonstration. With documented success, permanent authority 
        should be imminent in the 2023 Farm Bill Reauthorization.

        2. Support efforts to Fulfill U.S. Trust Responsibility to 
        Indian Tribes in the Stewardship of Federal Lands and Waters--
        The Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior issued a Joint 
        Secretarial Order 3403 to ensure that their departments and 
        component bureaus and offices are fulfilling the Trust 
        Responsibility in the stewardship of Federal lands and waters. 
        Even though there have been more than 20 new co-stewardship 
        agreements with Tribes to further stewardship goals, in the 
        past, Tribes have been made many promises and as we move into 
        another chapter of American Indian and Alaska Native history 
        with the United States, we ask that such fulfillment of the 
        U.S. Trust Responsibility be codified to protect the progress 
        made under this Joint Secretarial Order.

        3. Include $2 Million for USDA Rural Development Tribal 
        Technical Assistance Program--The 2018 Farm Bill mandated the 
        establishment of a Tribal Technical Assistance Program within 
        USDA-Rural Development (RD) designed to address the unique 
        challenges Indian Country faces when seeking infrastructure, 
        cooperative development, housing, and other development 
        opportunities funded by USDA-RD. Funding for this newly 
        established area is especially critical due to the unique 
        circumstances surrounding lending and infrastructure deployment 
        in Tribal communities, which often leads to either 
        misinformation provided to Tribal nations or misinterpretation 
        of Tribal applications. Appropriating $2 million to this 
        program will help to eliminate these unnecessary barriers to 
        development in Indian Country.

        4. Support the fiscal Year 2024 Budgets Requests of the 
        National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) and the Affiliated 
        Tribes of Northwest Indians (ATNI)
    Thank you for this opportunity to present written testimony and 
considering these requests.

                                 ______
                                 
            Prepared Statement of the Transfarmation Project
    Thank you for the opportunity to present The Transfarmation 
Project's fiscal Year 2024 funding requests. The Transfarmation Project 
works with farmers, local technical consultants, and research 
universities across the country to model agricultural systems that 
demonstrate the feasibility of transitioning contract poultry and 
livestock operations to more lucrative and resilient farming methods 
that center farmer autonomy and more sustainable production practices. 
We match enrolled farmers with local technical consultants and industry 
experts to design individualized farm transition plans, document those 
transitions, and create public-facing resources and economic models to 
serve as guides for other farmers to easily replicate. The 
Transfarmation Project aims to facilitate alternative business 
opportunities to farmers who would like to feed our Nation outside of 
the industrialized model. These alternatives offer farmers autonomy to 
make decisions for their business needs and promote competition by 
supporting local food systems.
    On behalf of the farmers, technical consultants, and supporters we 
serve, we submit the following requests for the Department of 
Agriculture:
                           general provisions
    Create a Climate-Smart Transition Initiative. USDA's conservation 
programs provide significant cost-share dollars for farmers 
implementing practices that protect water, soil, and wildlife; preserve 
ecosystems; and help farmers impacted by natural disasters. Federal 
programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, should be 
leveraged to more actively support climate-smart farm transitions that 
restore value to stranded farm assets and support beginning and 
socially disadvantaged farmers, in a larger effort to increase the 
resiliency of our entire agricultural system.
    Utilizing existing funding authorized under the Inflation Reduction 
Act (Section 21001(a)(1) of Public Law 117-169) to create a Federal 
climate-smart transition initiative would create a more just, 
equitable, and sustainable food system by transitioning high-emission 
animal confinement operations, such as contract poultry and hog farmers 
and dairy farmers, to growing lower-emission crops in a more resilient 
manner. These transitions level the playing field between foreign 
competition, and create a more secure domestic food system, by 
increasing year-round specialty crop production. This initiative will 
give farmers the freedom to respond to market changes, be competitive 
in emerging markets, create new jobs in rural communities, and leverage 
funding for the dual purpose of protecting environmental resources and 
increasing farm values.

                Proposed Bill Language. Climate-Smart Transition 
                Initiative.-Of the funds authorized under Section 
                21001(a)(1) of Public Law 117-169, the Secretary shall 
                provide grants and cooperative agreements that will 
                facilitate the adoption of more resilient and climate-
                smart agricultural practices by livestock and poultry 
                producers through infrastructure improvements related 
                to (1) providing animals with access to the outdoors or 
                pasture, and (2) converting to specialty and organic 
                crop production.

                Proposed Accompany Report language: Section 21001(a)(1) 
                of Public Law 117-169 appropriates $1.75 billion for 
                Fiscal Year 2024 to support conservation activities 
                under the environmental quality incentives program that 
                directly improve soil carbon, reduce nitrogen losses, 
                or reduce, capture, avoid, or sequester carbon dioxide, 
                methane, or nitrous oxide emissions, associated with 
                agricultural production. The committee directs the USDA 
                to include in these efforts, support for farmers who 
                wish to transition from high-emission animal production 
                systems to lower-emission farming methods that utilize 
                specialty crops and organic production methods. 
                Further, the committee directs the USDA to monitor 
                these climate-smart transition efforts, including but 
                not limited to: the costs associated with transitions 
                including any necessary upgrades, debt-relief, the 
                viability and the profitability of plant-focused 
                farming using existing infrastructure from animal 
                agriculture operations. The Committee directs the 
                Secretary to report back to this Committee with his 
                findings no later than 180 days after the enactment of 
                this legislation.

Additional Background:

    The uncertainty faced by our Nation's farmers due to the unbalanced 
influence of large agribusiness companies is an overlooked social and 
economic danger in the United States. The widely utilized contractor 
model that is especially prevalent in animal agriculture, combined with 
extreme weather events and the increasing unpredictability of market 
forces, have resulted in the bankruptcy and foreclosure of thousands of 
small American farmers, or the abandonment of farming altogether.
    To evaluate the economic viability of converting contract poultry 
and livestock facilities to specialty crop production, we worked with 
Virginia Tech to create proposed infrastructure conversion 
recommendations and with an agricultural economics firm to study the 
potential return on investment of these recommendations. We analyzed 
four crops to assess their potential to service the debt of these 
recommended infrastructure conversion. This data will help farmers 
interested in exiting the contract poultry or swine industry to select 
transition crops.
    The four crops we analyzed were cucumbers, tomatoes, microgreens, 
and strawberries. For each analysis, we created a projected enterprise 
budget that assumed an infrastructure conversion cost of $87,520 to 
$148,730 (depending on the crop analyzed); used a labor rate of $17.58 
per hour; and included a sensitivity analysis for factors such as price 
received, yield, and labor rate, as well as packaging, natural gas use, 
soil, and other relevant variable costs. The conversion costs in these 
analyses were based on the recommendations we received from Virginia 
Tech and independent greenhouse consultants for converting a 16,000-
square-foot space.
    The table below summarizes crop-specific gross returns, operating 
income, debt obligations, and debt-service coverage ratios for both 10-
year and 20-year financing. A debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) is a 
measurement of an operation's available cash flow to pay current debt 
obligations, calculated as net income divided by debt obligations 
(principal and interest payments). A DSCR of less than 1.0 poses 
potential solvency problems, while a ratio of at least 2.0 is generally 
considered very strong.

    As you can see from the table above, each crop analyzed has the 
potential to service the debt necessary to convert contract poultry and 
livestock operations, and provide substantial income to farmers. As 
this is a new use of these facilities and a new market for farmers who 
choose to enter this field, support from the Federal Government in the 
forms of grants and cooperative agreements would dramatically reduce 
the barriers to entry for farmers wanting to diversify their farming 
operations. In addition to reducing their environmental footprint, 
these transitioned operations will support the growth of rural jobs by 
diversifying their local economy.
    In the face of many complex challenges, such as food security, 
increased droughts, inflation, collapsing supply chains and global 
pandemics, investments are needed in American farmers, who stand at the 
very core of rural America, in a way that allows them to restore 
profitability and ensure their legacy of farming lives on for future 
generations. As small business owners who are integral to local 
economies and rural communities, farmers are stewards who remain driven 
by financial and production-oriented concerns. The costly and time-
consuming work of repurposing farmers' unused, stranded assets into 
active, resilient, and diversified farming operations has the potential 
to revitalize rural economies but only if producers have the ability to 
shift their production to readily respond to market conditions and 
capitalize on growing trends. Without action by policymakers, the 
current trends of dwindling farmers will further intensify and increase 
rural flight.

     Prepared Statement of the Western Governors' Association (WGA)
    Chair Heinrich, Ranking Member Hoeven, and Members of the 
subcommittee, the Western Governors' Association (WGA) appreciates the 
opportunity to provide written testimony on the appropriations and 
activities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). WGA is an 
independent organization representing the Governors of the 22 
westernmost States and territories. The Association is an instrument of 
the Governors for bipartisan policy development, information sharing 
and collective action on issues of critical importance to the western 
United States.
    USDA programs have a significant effect on the American West and 
the economic viability of its rural communities. Western Governors 
recognize the importance of a close and productive working relationship 
between States and the Federal Government and understand that more 
effective cooperation depends on Federal recognition of States as co-
sovereigns and partners. The promotion of greater partnership between 
States and the Federal Government is central to the mission of WGA and 
is reflected in the Governors' Policy Resolution 2021-01, Strengthening 
the State-Federal Relationship. WGA also commends your attention to 
other Western Governors' resolutions that articulate policy positions 
relevant to the subcommittee's work. These include Policy Resolutions 
2020-06, Western Agriculture; 2021-03, National Forest and Rangeland 
Management; 2022-11; Biosecurity and Invasive Species Management; 2021-
08, Water Resource Management in the West; 2021-04, Species 
Conservation and the Endangered Species Act; 2020-07, Rural 
Development; and 2020-08, Broadband Connectivity
    Agriculture in western States faces a variety of challenges, 
including extreme variations in soil, climate, terrain, commodity and 
specialty crops, production practices, and water availability. Amid 
these difficult conditions, the western agricultural sector provides a 
vast array of high-demand, high-quality food products for American and 
foreign markets. Western agricultural lands also serve as primary 
sources of crucial ecosystem services, including open space, wildlife 
habitat, and water supplies, and support a diverse suite of rural 
economic opportunities in the recreation, food, fiber, energy, and bio-
based product industries.
    USDA conservation programs promote responsible land management in 
western States and are of crucial importance to the agricultural 
sector, including livestock producers dependent on using Federal 
allotments through permits and fees to sustain their operations. 
Western Governors support targeted, voluntary, and collaborative 
conservation to address locally identified natural resource issues 
affecting farms, rangelands, and forests on private and public lands. 
These issues include soil health, air and water quality, drought and 
wildfire resilience, wildlife habitat conservation, and invasive 
species. WGA supports the role of conservation title programs under the 
Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) in promoting 
voluntary solutions to the challenges of threatened and endangered 
species, water quality impairments, and groundwater recharge. Western 
Governors encourage the subcommittee to support appropriate funding 
levels for programs addressing these critical concerns.
    The work of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is 
especially important to western States, and WGA encourages the 
subcommittee to provide adequate funding for conservation programs 
administered by the agency. NRCS empowers private landowners to work 
with States and the Federal Government on large-scale management 
priorities across landscapes with different land ownerships. NRCS 
programs provide multiple benefits to western communities:

  --Stimulating economic activity and creating jobs in local 
        communities;

  --Conserving habitat for the greater sage-grouse, lesser prairie 
        chicken, and other species;

  --Mitigating wildland fire potential in western States;

  --Improving water quality;

  --Reducing the threat of invasive species on western lands; and

  --Responding to imminent hazards caused by floods, wildfire, 
        windstorms, and other natural disasters through the Emergency 
        Watershed Protection Program.

    Western Governors also support adequate funding of NRCS' Snow 
Survey and Water Supply Forecasting (SSWSF) program. Sufficient funding 
is required to ensure the long-term viability of the program's 
continued and uninterrupted collection of snowpack and water data, the 
full operation and maintenance of all snow survey sites, the hiring of 
needed program staff, and technological and software upgrades. The 
SSWSF program provides integral information for water supply management 
decisions in agricultural production, hydroelectric power generation, 
reservoir operations, industry, recreation and economic development, 
and international treaties. The program's predictive capabilities are 
critically useful throughout the arid West, where snowpack accounts for 
the vast majority of the region's annual water supply.
    Western Governors support adequate funding for the National 
Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). Western Governors recognize 
the valuable role NIFA plays in research on biosecurity and invasive 
species and support further research to understand the potential spread 
of invasive species and to develop geographically appropriate control 
measures.
    The West's network of land grant universities and colleges, 
including Cooperative Extension Service programs and Agricultural 
Experiment Stations, provides national leadership in research to 
develop more resilient seeds and crops, manage soil health, advance 
technology deployment in the bio-based economy, and conduct on-farm 
research experiments that help farmers and ranchers be more effective 
and efficient. Western Governors support efforts to expand research 
funding to address drought, a changing climate, and extreme weather 
risks facing western producers. WGA also encourages the effective use 
of Extension to deliver practical tools, technologies, and information 
to farmers, ranchers and forest landowners and to respond to the 
changing needs of rural communities.
    Healthy, vibrant, and prosperous rural communities are critical to 
western States. Rural communities, however, face a variety of 
challenges with respect to economic development, infrastructure, and 
quality of life. Western Governors support USDA's Rural Development 
programs, which address those challenges, and request an increased 
emphasis on rural capacity-building efforts. Building local capacity 
through training, technical assistance, and consistent support for 
institutions that serve rural communities is fundamental to economic 
and community development and maximizes the effect of State and Federal 
resources. It will be especially important to maximize the benefits of 
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Pub. L. 117-58) for rural 
communities. At the same time, Western Governors urge USDA to evaluate 
rural development programs, identify barriers for rural applicants, and 
revise onerous requirements in a manner that recognizes the limited 
resources and capacity of rural applicants.
    Western Governors support rural development programs aimed at 
fostering small businesses, entrepreneurs, and cooperative business 
models, and appreciate the increase in funding for the Rural Business-
Cooperative Service in fiscal Year 2023. Western agricultural 
cooperatives perform many important functions for their members and 
rural communities. These include provision of seed, feed, and 
fertilizer to growers; product storage, processing, and transportation; 
trade and market promotion; supply chain solutions; and education and 
technical assistance. Cooperative business models can also help meet 
rural community needs for childcare, homecare, main street businesses, 
and more. Western Governors recognize the need for substantial 
technical assistance and education in developing new cooperative 
businesses and support funding to promote these efforts, including USDA 
Rural Cooperative Development Grants and Value-Added Producer Grants, 
and programs administered by USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service and 
NIFA.
    Western Governors also remain committed to creating new 
opportunities for rural job seekers and for young people to pursue 
careers in their rural communities. WGA supports solutions that 
leverage public universities, community colleges, and the business 
community to provide the appropriate training and skills for the jobs 
that are available in rural communities.
    Western Governors support funding for the Market Access and Foreign 
Market Development Programs to promote opportunities for western 
producers to increase export revenues and encourage trade agreements 
that maximize benefits for the West's farmers, ranchers, and forest 
landowners. WGA also supports adequate funding for the Specialty Crop 
Block Grant Program, which provides critical research, education, and 
promotion tools to fruit and vegetable producers.
    Western Governors support the continued efforts of the Rural 
Utilities Service to provide financial assistance for drinking water 
and wastewater facilities, renewable energy projects on agricultural 
lands, and broadband connectivity in rural and remote areas, 
particularly in communities that have minimal or no such 
infrastructure. Western Governors support dedicated funding to develop 
innovative solutions for communities and Tribes that cannot be served 
by traditional drinking water and wastewater systems. Governors also 
remain concerned by the Nationwide shortage of certified water system 
operators. Ongoing and coordinated efforts to develop these skilled 
workers are necessary to ensure that existing water access in rural 
communities can be maintained.
    Expanding broadband access to rural America empowers citizens to 
compete in a global market and access electronic information and 
telecommunications technologies to support and promote telehealth and 
distance learning. Western Governors note the significance of programs 
such as the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program and the 
ReConnect Program, which support broadband deployment to underserved or 
wholly unserved rural communities, and appreciate the subcommittee's 
continued commitment to the ReConnect Program and rural broadband. 
Consistent funding for these programs is critical to closing the 
digital divide. In addition, Western Governors are pleased that the 
minimum speed for ReConnect eligibility remains at 100/20 Mbps, as 25/3 
Mbps does not correspond with the requisite download and upload speeds 
necessary to support modern internet needs.
    Given the numerous Federal agency programs, policies, and 
regulations directly affecting the collective States, agency 
coordination with States and the integration of state data into Federal 
programs for policymaking is paramount to their success. Western 
Governors support full and consistent Federal funding for agencies to 
carry out the requirements of the Foundations for Evidence-Based 
Policymaking Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-435) and encourage the 
subcommittee to direct Federal agencies to improve their internal 
processes and coordinate with States on Federal data policies and 
procedures, as required in the act.
    Western Governors recognize that nutrition assistance programs can 
help meet the needs of children and the most vulnerable, while creating 
economic opportunity across the agriculture supply chain from the store 
where food is purchased all the way back to the farm. Nutrition 
assistance programs should continue to provide flexibility for States 
to respond to unique economic conditions, serve all eligible 
participants without drastically reducing benefits, and pursue 
transparency and accountability in program administration.
    Western States and Federal agencies deal with a complex web of 
interrelated agriculture, conservation, and economic development 
priorities. It is an enormous challenge to judiciously balance 
competing needs in this environment, and Western Governors appreciate 
the difficulty of the decisions the subcommittee must make. The 
foregoing recommendations are offered in a spirit of cooperation and 
respect, and WGA is prepared to assist you in discharging these 
critical and challenging responsibilities.

               Prepared Statement of the Wildlife Society
    The Wildlife Society (TWS; wildlife.org) inspires, empowers, and 
enables wildlife professionals to sustain wildlife populations and 
their habitat through science-based management and conservation. 
Founded in 1937, TWS and our network of affiliated chapters and 
sections represents more than 15,000 professional wildlife biologists, 
managers, and educators dedicated to excellence in wildlife 
stewardship. As leaders in wildlife science, management, and 
conservation, TWS promotes the use of science in all aspects of policy 
and decision-making and is also committed to the identification and 
removal of barriers to recruitment, effective mentoring, and retention 
of a diverse workforce.
    The Wildlife Society appreciates the opportunity to submit 
testimony concerning the Fiscal Year 2024 budgets for the Animal and 
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), National Institute of Food and 
Agriculture (NIFA), and the Natural Resources Conservation Service 
(NRCS). We respectfully request the following programmatic funding in 
fiscal Year 2024. Thank you in advance for considering the views of The 
Wildlife Society.

               animal and plant health inspection service
    APHIS Wildlife Services resolves human-wildlife conflicts and 
protects wildlife, agriculture, and human health and safety from 
wildlife damage and wildlife-borne diseases. The Wildlife Damage 
Management program provides frontline assistance to cooperators to 
protect natural and human-made resources. We appreciate the increase 
for this program in fiscal Year 2023 and encourage Congress to provide 
another small increase in funding in fiscal Year 2024 to $123 million 
as requested by the Administration. Maintaining inflation-adjusted 
funding levels will allow Wildlife Services to carry out programs 
identified by Congress as key focus areas, including the National 
Rabies Management Program, which distributes oral rabies vaccines to 
wildlife within targeted areas with the goal of disease elimination, 
and the feral swine management program, which works with cooperators to 
protect natural and human-made resources against this highly 
destructive non-native species.
    Methods Development, also within Wildlife Services, funds the 
vitally important National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC), which 
provides tools that the Damage Management program, as well as federal, 
State, and local partners need to deter human-wildlife conflict in the 
field setting. TWS thanks Congress for increased funding in fiscal Year 
2023 and requests another small increase in fiscal Year 2024 to allow 
the NWRC to continue to deliver new research critical to state wildlife 
agencies, Federal agencies, and municipalities, including novel 
deterrents to prevent predator conflict with livestock, the development 
of new humane toxicants against feral swine, and research into the 
efficacy of fertility control applications in free-roaming horses.
               national institute of food and agriculture
    The Renewable Resources Extension Act (RREA) provides resources to 
state extension programs that share with landowners and managers the 
latest management tools applicable to forest and rangeland resources, 
including wildlife management. RREA funds private landowner outreach 
and effectively leverages cooperative partnerships at an average ratio 
of four to one. These extension programs improve management practices 
on over 43 million acres. Authorized at $30 million, RREA has seen flat 
funding at only $4 million annually for over a decade. TWS requests an 
increase in RREA funding to at least $10 million in fiscal Year 2024.
    The McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Program also has a long 
history of effectively leveraging outside dollars that benefit private 
land management practices. This program requires a 1:1 non-federal 
match for research projects related to producing, using, and protecting 
natural resources based on identified private landowner needs. The 
funds are targeted at public and land grant university research, which 
in turn fosters the next generation of natural resources professionals. 
Private landowners own approximately 300 million acres (over 35 
percent) of the Nation's forests and woodlands. Funding of $43 million 
in fiscal Year 2024 will allow NIFA to make continued investments in 
conservation and management techniques on the Nation's private lands.
    The USDA's budget request includes $370 million for Minority-
Serving Institution programs, which support capacity-building 
initiatives, education, and pathways to employment at minority-serving 
institutions. TWS strongly support policies, programs, and practices 
that advance efforts to recruit, mentor, and retain professionals from 
a broad spectrum of identities, including individuals from historically 
underrepresented backgrounds.
    The Hispanic Serving Institutions Education Partnerships Grants 
Program expands and strengthens academic programs in the agricultural 
sciences, natural resources, forestry, and other disciplines tied to 
the food and agriculture production and delivery systems at Hispanic-
serving colleges and universities. TWS supports the administration's 
request for a $4 million increase for this program and encourages 
funding at $20 million in fiscal Year 2024.
    The Alaska Native Serving and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions 
Education Grants are aimed at recruiting, supporting and educating 
minority scientists and professionals, and advancing the educational 
capacity of Native-serving institutions. TWS appreciates the recent 
increases in funding for this program and encourages funding at $6 
million in fiscal Year 2024.
    The 1890 Institutions Centers of Excellence are designed to supply 
the country with a globally diverse workforce and support critical 
global development needs, thereby addressing trans-boundary research 
and education challenges including climate change, biodiversity 
conservation and development. We encourage Congress to provide a small 
increase for this important program in fiscal Year 2024, bringing 
funding to $11 million.
    We also encourage Congress to support other USDA Minority-Serving 
Institution programs administered by NIFA, such as the National 
Scholars Program, which is intended to increase the number of minority 
students enrolling in agriculture, food, natural resource sciences, and 
other related programs in pursuit of a bachelor's degree at Land Grant 
Universities, and the Tribal Scholars Program, which seeks to increase 
the number of American Indian and Alaska Native students studying 
agriculture, food, natural resources, and related disciplines.
                 natural resources conservation service
    The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is the primary 
Federal agency working with private land and farm owners to help them 
conserve, maintain, and improve natural resources on their lands, 
including soil, water, air, plants, fish, and wildlife. In fiscal Year 
2024, TWS requests that Congress provide full funding to the 
conservation programs authorized by the 2018 Farm Bill, which work with 
landowners to provide measurable benefits for fish and wildlife.
    TWS also urges Congress to provide critical discretionary funding 
for Private Lands Conservation Operations administered by NRCS, 
including Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA). The CTA program 
provides landowners with site-specific solutions needed to implement 
conservation programs, while also providing for public accountability 
to ensure funds are spent as intended. As Congress turns its attention 
to constructing and modifying private lands programs in the 2023 Farm 
Bill, demand for technical assistance will continue to grow. TWS 
requests Congress fund this vital program at the Administration-
requested $904 million in fiscal Year 2024.
    Thank you for considering the views of wildlife professionals. 
Please reach out to Caroline Murphy, AWB(r), TWS government relations 
manager (cmurphy@wildlife.org), with any questions regarding these 
recommendations.

    Prepared Statement of National Center for Appropriate Technology
    Request: An increase of $2.5 million fiscal Year 2024 appropriation 
for biochar research by the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) 
for new research at the Sidney, Montana Northern Plains Agricultural 
Research Laboratory, the Prosser, Washington ARS site, and the ARS 
National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment at Ames, Iowa 
to be undertaken in conjunction with ongoing ARS biochar research at 
other sites. This request is for ongoing appropriations for permanent 
positions to conduct long-term research.
    Background: The proposed research would test a common set of 
biochar types across multiple sites to advance understanding of the 
impact of diverse types of biochar in varying soils and circumstances 
on soil health, productivity, and carbon sequestration. This multisite 
research will inform farmers and ranchers on which types of biochar 
have positive impacts in their soils and circumstances.
    Findings would be used to develop and refine decision-support tools 
for use by producers and provide the basis for expanding applied 
research on integration of biochar in local production systems. The 
research would also provide the knowledge to design and certify 
different types and treatments of biochar for use in different soils 
and circumstances.
    Rationale: Research suggests that appropriately designed biochar 
can increase soil health, plant available water, soil fertility and 
plant growth and yields, thereby enhancing agricultural productivity 
and resilience as well as food security. Research results are 
inconsistent, however, because different types of biochar are being 
tested in varying soils and circumstances.
    Biochar is highly effective in addressing the challenge of building 
and maintaining soil carbon/organic matter. Planting cover crops can 
add carbon to soil and no-till farming can in some instances slow 
breakdown of crop residue. But under either practice, organic matter is 
largely decomposed in a few years and released back to the atmosphere 
as CO2.
    The unique promise of biochar is that it provides ``recalcitrant'' 
soil carbon that lasts for hundreds to thousands of years. In addition, 
appropriately designed biochar can slow the breakdown of other soil 
carbon. Thus, biochar integrated with other soil building practices may 
add more to soil carbon and organic matter than the sum of each alone.
    But to realize biochar's full potential, we need coordinated 
research to determine which types of biochar are beneficial in varying 
soils and circumstances. This request meets that need and reflects the 
recommendations of leading biochar researchers and the 2022 Convening 
on Biochar Research and Commercialization which included agency and 
industry stakeholders. The cross-site research that would be supported 
by this research is far more efficient way to close critical knowledge 
gaps on biochar than funding uncoordinated individual research 
projects.
    The Biochar Policy Project has discussed this proposal with, and 
received favorable responses from, the relevant ARS National Program 
Leaders and with staff at the three proposed locations.

    [This statement was submitted by Chuck Hassebrook, Director of the 
Biochar Policy Project of the National Center for Appropriate 
Technology.]
