STATEMENT OF HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY


               opening statement of senator brian schatz


    Senator Schatz. Good morning. This hearing will come to 
order. Good morning and welcome to everyone, especially the new 
Ranking Member, Senator Hyde-Smith. I am excited to work with 
you. I know you appreciate the importance of infrastructure and 
housing in your home State, and we have already talked about 
some of these priorities.
    I have had the pleasure of working with Senator Collins for 
the last 2 years, and we have been able to find common ground 
on everything from aviation safety to youth homelessness and 
affordable housing.
    Every member on this committee knows the importance of 
stable bridges, efficient airports, and safe cars, and so I 
look forward to continuing the bipartisan and cooperative 
nature of this subcommittee with you, Senator Hyde-Smith, 
Secretary Buttigieg, thank you for appearing today to testify 
on the President's fiscal year 2024 request for the Department 
of Transportation.
    We very much look forward to discussing your sustained 
focus on safety, equity, and climate at the Department. We are 
in the second year of implementing the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act that brought historic investments to 
our transportation systems.
    On a bipartisan basis, we made the right decision to fix 
our aging infrastructure and begin taking steps to adapt to 
climate change. But we face a reversal of that commitment--we 
do face a reversal of that commitment if we entertain the House 
majority proposal to return to 2022 funding levels.
    We would face an automatic cut of $16 billion simply 
because of the increase to HUD rental assistance and lowering 
offsetting receipts from FHA and Ginnie Mae, excuse me. This 
would decrease FAA's air traffic controller workforce and 
safety inspectors, and lead to major flight cancellations and 
delays, and it would hurt all sectors of transportation, would 
face cuts to essential air service, Amtrak, subway service in 
big cities, and bus service in rural areas.
    The impact on safety would be even worse. There would be 
fewer inspections of new Boeing aircraft, fewer inspections of 
bridges like the one that collapsed in Pittsburgh last year, 
and fewer inspections of the rail lines like the one in East 
Palestine.
    These issues are outlined in a letter from you, Mr. 
Secretary, to Chairwoman DeLauro, which I am submitting for the 
record, and I encourage my colleagues to review. Now is not the 
time to slash critical investments if we want to sustain the 
progress we have made in investing in our infrastructure.
    Instead, we need to build on that success. The President's 
budget request does exactly that with strong investments in 
FAA, rail research, and highway safety. Specifically, it 
includes a hiring surge for air traffic controllers after the 
COVID crisis, shutting down the training academy for 2 years.
    A number of recent near misses have highlighted the need 
for more training and technology, and new ways of thinking 
throughout the aviation industry. The COVID relief funding for 
airlines and airports allow the aviation sector to recover 
quickly, and it is incumbent on us to have the qualified staff 
to meet the growing demand. Airlines also need to be held 
accountable.
    The Secretary is engaged with the airlines on how to 
improve the customer experience, and I think more needs to be 
done. While the budget request was written before the East 
Palestine incident, we need to work together to improve 
standards and deploy technologies to prevent future incidents.
    I support the recommendations to revisit the cost share for 
rural transit and the benefits this also provide to tribal 
transportation. I think we need to do more to improve access to 
competitive programs for tribes where cost share is really a 
barrier to accessing Federal funds. I also need to mention road 
safety.
    The National Safety Council estimates that more than 46,000 
people were killed in motor vehicle crashes in 2022. That is 
nearly 10,000 more, 10,000 more than 10 years ago. In Hawaii, 
roadway deaths were up 24 percent in a 1 year period. Just 
yesterday, six construction workers were killed on the 
Baltimore Beltway when a driver crashed into a work zone.
    Too many tragedies like this occur every day and we know 
they can be prevented. NHTSA needs to rapidly implement the 
rules Congress directed, some of which are more than a decade 
overdue. I want to just say that again. NHTSA needs to rapidly 
implement the rules that Congress directed, some of which are 
more than a decade overdue. I look forward to your explanation 
of the delays and a plan moving forward.
    With all that said, Secretary Buttigieg, I look forward to 
hearing your testimony shortly. Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, I 
want to reiterate how glad I am to see you as Ranking Member of 
this subcommittee, and I turn to you for your opening 
statement.


                 statement of senator cindy hyde-smith


    Senator Hyde-Smith. And let me begin by thanking Chairwoman 
and the Vice Chairman of the Appropriations committee for 
joining us today.
    And Vice Chairman Collins, I am certainly committed to 
upholding your thoughtful and your effective leadership on this 
subcommittee for the past several years, and I appreciate your 
work there because you have truly been a strong advocate for 
your constituents and such success on bipartisan working 
relationships. But I would also like to thank the Chairman 
Schatz for that kind welcome.
    Mississippi and Hawaii may be in different time zones and 
face different transportation infrastructure challenges, but I 
am confident that we will find common ground to work together 
in this subcommittee and address the obstacles facing not only 
our constituents but all Americans.
    And as we work to craft responsible funding legislation for 
fiscal year 2024, I look forward to continuing the 
collaborative spirit that you and Vice Chairman Collins have 
established. I also welcome our witness, Secretary Buttigieg, 
and I certainly enjoyed our visit yesterday when you came to my 
office and look forward to your testimony and I look forward to 
working with you.
    The Department's budget request comes in the wake of, as we 
have discussed, several serious and troubling incidents across 
our transportation sectors, including multiple near misses at 
airports, the closing of our nation's airspace for the first 
time since 9/11 from an infected fall of the notice to air 
mission systems, otherwise known as Notice to Air Missions 
(NOTAMS), and numerous derailments, most notably those in East 
Palestine, Ohio.
    We must continue to ensure that we have the safest, most 
reliable transportation network in the entire world. And the 
appropriations process is the best way to provide oversight and 
evaluate the funding needs. We also must ensure that our rural 
communities have adequate support from the Federal Government.
    Rural communities face very unique challenges. What works 
in larger urban areas often does not work in smaller rural 
areas like those across Mississippi. As such, we must formulate 
a funding bill that strikes a healthy balance that we can meet 
the needs of all Americans. The Administration's fiscal year 
2024 request in DOT is $108.5 billion, which is 1 percent 
increase over the fiscal year 2023 enacted levels.
    I am disappointed to see that even with the proposed 
increase funding, this request zeroes out programs that are 
priorities for this subcommittee. Specifically, this budget 
request zeroes out the RAISE Grant Program that the Bridge 
Formula Program and the Airport Improvement Program 
supplemental funding--each of these programs have been very 
crucial for rural communities, especially in states like 
Mississippi.
    Some past projects that I would like to highlight right now 
is a RAISE Grant award to Yazoo City, Mississippi. Everybody 
has trouble pronouncing Yazoo City, which will be used to make 
much needed infrastructure updates and to revitalize their main 
street.
    In an airport improvement program investment at Key Field 
in Meridian, Mississippi, to rehabilitate the runway and 
install a runway guidance system that will improve safety and 
allow the airport to operate more efficiently.
    However, pleased to see that the budget request continues 
to fully fund the Essential Air Service Program, which ensures 
connectivity to our nation's rural communities, as well as 
investments to modernize and increase safety at the FAA. 
Smaller airports, like the ones located in Greenville, Tupelo, 
and Hattiesburg, Mississippi, benefit from the Essential Air 
Service (EAS) program to ensure safe travel for customers 
needing access to smaller markets.
    New businesses will rarely locate in areas without 
dependable commercial air service. So, these smaller airports 
are very vital for the economic development in these areas. 
Additionally, the budget request includes robust funding for 
the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements 
grant programs to develop a safer rail network.
    So, I believe that the funding decisions need to be met 
with fiscal responsible decisionmaking that ensures taxpayers 
are prioritized also. With that in mind, Secretary Buttigieg, I 
look forward to hearing from you and working together for the 
American people. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you very much. Are there any members 
wishing to make an opening statement? If not, Secretary 
Buttigieg, please proceed with your testimony.


                summary statement of hon. pete buttigieg


    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you very much, Chair Schatz, 
Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, Vice Chair of the committee Collins 
and all of the members of the subcommittee here for the 
opportunity to discuss the President's fiscal year 2024 budget 
request for the Department of Transportation, totaling $145 
billion.
    The budget will propel our Department's work across our 
three major categories of effort, running our operations well 
in the agency, building good things well across the country, 
and protecting the safety and well-being of everyone who 
interacts with America's transportation systems.
    In each of these areas, of course, Congress plays a 
fundamental role. And I want to thank members on both sides of 
the aisle who have been true partners as we have worked to 
build a stronger, safer transportation system.
    I join you today at a moment of historic challenge as well 
as opportunity in our transportation systems, as they cope with 
profoundly disruptive forces that include continued shockwaves 
from the coronavirus pandemic, increasing threats from climate 
change, and the effects of decades of disinvestment, which are 
thankfully coming to an end as we implement the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).
    A further source of instability has to do with the conduct 
of many players in transportation related industries. Over the 
years, a drastic tendency away from competition and toward 
concentration has developed, while at the same time, many of 
the biggest firms were slashing staff and costs, often boosting 
their profitability, but too often at the public's expense.
    And the result is a transportation system today that is 
still too vulnerable, and when any part of it strains or 
breaks, the costs are borne by the American people. But we are 
also in a moment of tremendous opportunity and progress.
    We are making infrastructure investments across the 
country, using the funds that Congress entrusted to us. And we 
are seeing some new and welcomed bipartisan support in this 
chamber for much needed safety regulations on freight 
railroads, including a number of policies we had been calling 
for and which we strongly support.
    I would like to highlight a few vital areas where we have 
made progress in the last year and the further strides we can 
make through the President's fiscal year 2024 budget. On 
aviation, we are getting airlines to honor the tickets that 
they sell while advancing safety measures across industry and 
within the FAA.
    But there is still far more to do as recent events make 
clear. The 2024 budget invests $24.8 billion to make needed 
investments to add air traffic controllers, improve the safety 
and capacity of America's airports, and accelerate the 
modernization of critical systems and infrastructure, such as 
the notice to air missions system.
    On rail, we have made nearly $18 billion available to 
improve rail service and safety and published our proposed rule 
requiring a minimum of two train crew members. Derailments may 
be down compared to prior decades, but we are still seeing far 
too many.
    For every community like East Palestine that has been 
impacted, and every community wondering if they're next, the 
status quo is clearly not acceptable. The President's budget 
includes $273 million to support Federal Railroad 
Administration safety personnel, expand inspection 
capabilities, and increase stakeholder engagement to address 
risks.
    Meanwhile, we put 3,700 bridges and almost 70,000 miles of 
road on the path to improvement, which means a safer ride and 
lower maintenance costs for millions of families and truck 
drivers. And we awarded grants for the first ever Safe Streets 
and Roads for All program.
    We still see far too many fatal crashes on our roads, and I 
want to join the Chair in pausing to acknowledge the tragic 
crash on I-695 in Maryland yesterday when a driver entered a 
work zone, struck and killed multiple workers. We cannot and 
must not accept that roadway fatalities are an inevitable part 
of life in America.
    Our budget includes $3.1 million for the Highway Safety 
Improvement Program, new funding for safer walking and biking 
infrastructure, advanced safety research initiatives, and 
Strengthening Mobility and Revolutionizing Transportation 
(SMART) grants like the ones we awarded just this week that 
pilot innovative solutions to protect drivers, pedestrians, 
bicyclists, and construction workers.
    With regard to transit, we have advanced projects from bus 
rapid transit in Charleston to light rail in Seattle. The 
budget includes $4.45 billion for Capital Investment Grants to 
move forward with major projects that improve American 
transportation for generations, like the Hudson River tunnels 
and the FrontRunner double track project in Salt Lake City. And 
the budget also includes policy proposals that would allow 
transit agencies the flexibility they need to adapt to post-
pandemic shifts in ridership.
    For supply chains, we have made critical investments in 
ports from Columbus, Mississippi, to Los Angeles so that goods 
move more quickly. And we have taken measures that have helped 
the course of Pacific shipping rates go down by 80 percent.
    This budget provides $230 million for the Port 
Infrastructure Development Program to build on this important 
work. There is a great deal of progress underway and a great 
deal yet to be done.
    Together, we are stewards of a transportation system 
finally seeing renewal in its physical foundations but showing 
real points of vulnerability that endanger communities and 
workers, especially in the places where Federal oversight and 
regulation have been undermined.
    Congress was able to pass a bipartisan infrastructure law, 
of proportions that eluded our predecessors for decades. Now we 
need that same bipartisan strength to sustain these ongoing 
infrastructure investments, to make progress on safety 
regulations, and to protect Americans counting on that 
infrastructure.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to appear, and I am 
looking forward to your questions.
    [The statement follows:]

               Prepared Statement of Hon. Peter Buttigieg

    Chair Schatz, Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, and Members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss 
President Biden's Fiscal Year 2024 Budget request for the 
Department of Transportation, totaling $145 billion.
    The budget will propel our Department's work across our 
three major categories of effort: running our operations well 
in the agency; building good things well across the country; 
and protecting the safety and wellbeing of everyone who 
interacts with America's transportation systems--from 
pedestrians to airline passengers to rail workers.
    In each of these areas, Congress of course plays a 
fundamental role. I want to thank Members on both sides of the 
aisle who have been true partners as we work to build a 
stronger, safer transportation system.
    I join you today at moment of historic challenge and 
opportunity in our transportation system, as it copes with 
profoundly disruptive forces that include continued shockwaves 
from the coronavirus pandemic, increasing threats from climate 
change, and the effects of decades of disinvestment which are 
thankfully coming to an end now that we are implementing the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
    I believe that a further source of instability across our 
transportation systems has to do with the conduct of many 
players in transportation-related industries. Over the years, a 
drastic tendency away from competition and towards 
concentration has been visible in these industries. And at the 
same time, many of the biggest firms in transportation have 
slashed staff and costs, often boosting their profitability but 
too often at the expense of operational effectiveness and 
public benefit.
    As these patterns collide, we have seen effects ranging 
from exhaustion of rail workers that labor organizations have 
warned could undermine safety, to strained supply chains 
requiring concentrated public sector attention and 
intervention.
    The result is a transportation system today that is still 
too vulnerable, and when any part of it strains or breaks, the 
costs are borne by the American people--from the frustrations 
of millions of airline passengers to the terror felt by the 
residents of East Palestine, Ohio after the derailment there.
    But we are also in a moment of tremendous opportunity and 
progress. We are making infrastructure investments across the 
country using the tools and funds that Congress provided to 
us--and we are seeing some new and welcome bipartisan support 
for much-needed safety regulations, including a number of 
policies we have called for, and which we strongly support.
    I'd like to highlight a few critical areas where we have 
made progress in the last year, and the further strides we can 
make through the President's Fiscal Year 2024 budget.
    On aviation, we are getting airlines to honor the tickets 
they sell and compensate passengers fairly when there are 
issues, while advancing safety measures across industry and 
within the FAA. But there is still far more to do, as recent 
events make clear. The 2024 budget invests $24.8 billion to 
make needed investments to add air traffic controllers, improve 
the safety and capacity of America's airports, and accelerate 
the modernization of critical systems and infrastructure such 
as the Notice to Air Mission System.
    On rail, we have made nearly $18 billion available to 
improve rail service and safety, advanced more than 70 critical 
rail projects across the country, and published our proposed 
rule requiring a minimum of two train crewmembers. Derailments 
may be down compared to prior decades, but we're still seeing 
far too many. And incidents in rail yards and with at-grade 
crossings are on the rise. For every community like East 
Palestine that has been impacted, and every community wondering 
if they're next, the status quo is clearly not acceptable. 
That's why the President's budget includes $273 million to 
support Federal Railroad Administration safety personnel, 
expand inspection capabilities, and increase stakeholder 
engagement to address risks.
    Meanwhile, we have put 3,700 bridges on the path to 
improvement, so trucks and commuters can get where they need to 
be without delay; we are helping States improve almost 70,000 
miles of roads, which means a safer ride and lower maintenance 
costs for millions of families; we awarded grants for the 
first-ever Safe Streets and Roads For All program, and partners 
are stepping up in response to our National Roadway Safety 
Strategy. But we still see far too many fatal crashes on our 
roads. Our budget includes $3.1 billion for the Highway Safety 
Improvement Program, new funding for safer walking and biking 
infrastructure, and advanced safety research initiatives.
    On transit, we have advanced projects from bus rapid 
transit in Charleston, to light rail in Seattle. This budget 
includes $4.45 billion for Capital Investment Grants, to move 
forward with major projects that will improve American 
transportation for generations, like the Hudson River Tunnels 
between New York and New Jersey, and the Front Runner Double 
Track project in Salt Lake City. The budget also includes 
policy proposals that would allow transit agencies the 
flexibility to use formula funding for operating expenses to 
adapt to post-pandemic shifts in ridership.
    On supply chains, we have made critical investments in 
ports from Columbus, Mississippi to Los Angeles so that goods 
move more quickly--and we have taken measures that helped cut 
the number of ships waiting at America's largest ports from 
over 100 down to the single digits, and helped bring Pacific 
shipping prices down 80%. This budget provides $230 million for 
the Port Infrastructure Development Program to build upon this 
important work.
    There is a great deal of progress underway, and a great 
deal yet to be done.
    Together we are stewards of a transportation system that is 
finally seeing renewal in its physical foundations but shows 
real points of vulnerability that endanger communities and 
workers--especially in the places where Federal oversight and 
regulation have been undermined.
    Congress in recent years has shown itself capable of 
delivering a bipartisan infrastructure law that evaded our 
predecessors for decades. Now we need that same bipartisan 
strength to sustain those ongoing infrastructure investments--
and to make progress on safety regulations that protect 
Americans driving, flying, walking, riding--and counting--on 
that infrastructure.
    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.

                        RAIL EMERGENCY RESPONSE

    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Let me start with 
the FRA. What is FRA doing to review the performance of wayside 
detection technologies, railroad standards for an emergency 
notification, and emergency response procedures?
    Secretary Buttigieg. These wayside detection devices are 
installed alongside tracks and they can provide advance warning 
when there are issues that couldn't be detected by other means.
    Not all derailments are caused by an issue in the rail. 
Sometimes it is an issue on board. This is something that 
historically has not been the subject of Federal regulation, 
although we did put out a safety advisory in the wake of the 
East Palestine case from FRA regarding this.
    But we have seen them deployed by a number of railroads and 
are interested in working with Congress, as well as examining 
our existing authorities to create more regularity and 
standardization about the use of these tools because we think 
they can play an important role in preventing crashes and 
derailments.
    Senator Schatz. No, I think that is perfect. I think we are 
going to have to get our lawyers together to figure out whether 
you have all the authorities you need. And if so, then we will 
push you to utilize those authorities to get some sort of 
standardization.
    But if you need statutory authority, I don't think this is 
particularly controversial that each railroad should not have 
their own boutique version of this. This is a safety question 
and there should be standards across the industry. I just want 
to talk to you about airport resiliency.

                           AIRPORT RESILIENCY

    The short version of this is that lots of runways are going 
to be facing coastal inundation. And so, this is not a climate 
policy question, right. That is not the jurisdiction of this 
committee. But to the extent that the sea level is rising, that 
has impacts across the country in our airports. Do you have the 
authority you need to help airports to respond to that?
    And are you doing enough to encourage airports to 
recognize, whatever your politics are about energy policy or 
this or that or the Inflation Reduction Act, the very pragmatic 
question in front of us is how do we prevent sea level rise 
from damaging our airports?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, we are certainly doing all we 
can with the authorities that we have. The FAA supports airport 
sponsors that include resiliency in their master planning 
effort. And those master plans are eligible for funding through 
the Airport Improvement Program (AIP).
    And we are certainly encouraging those airports, those 
project sponsors, to work with their local district offices to 
develop scope of analyses dealing with resiliency that may not 
have been contemplated specifically in the past.
    The 2023 enacted appropriation gave FAA the authority to 
use supplemental funds specifically to address resiliency and 
would welcome opportunities to work with Congress to continue 
that kind of support, because I believe the need for attention 
to resiliency affecting all of our infrastructure, certainly 
affecting airports, is only going to grow each passing year.
    Senator Schatz. Yes, I just want to point out, the model 
here is the DOD, right. The DOD doesn't get to have an opinion 
necessarily about climate action or whatever, but they have 
bases and installations and they don't have the luxury of 
pretending that there aren't some issues, especially with our 
Navy bases.

                  TRIBAL ACCESS TO COMPETITIVE GRANTS

    Moving on to some tribal issues, a real barrier for tribes 
to access Federal competitive grants is the cost share 
requirement. Would you support expanding the cost share waiver 
proposed in the budget more broadly to FTA competitive programs 
for tribes?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Yes, we have this in the tribal 
transit formula and competitive programs, but not other FTA 
programs. And when I am meeting with tribal leaders and we are 
traveling in Indian Country, we hear this refrain again and 
again and again.
    Sometimes 20 percent of those projects would not always 
look like a large figure from a Washington perspective, but to 
those tribes, it could be the difference between a project 
happening and not happening, so we would love to work on that.

                         IMPAIRED DRIVING RULE

    Senator Schatz. The IIJA requires NHTSA to finalize a rule 
on impaired driving. Are we on time? Can you give me an update, 
please?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Yes. So, the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration (NHTSA) will soon be posting an annual 
report that is going to share more detailed information on the 
rulemaking status, and I am going to defer to that report on 
anticipated timelines.
    But what I can tell you is that NHTSA is working very hard 
to develop the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, including 
on areas like the impaired driving detection technology, which 
is novel and different from the kinds of things that they have 
prescribed in the past, but that we recognize the urgency, 
importance, and interest of, given its potential to prevent 
crashes and fatalities.

                              BUY AMERICA

    Senator Schatz. Final question. The President in his State 
of the Union said, ``And when we do projects, we are going to 
buy American.'' Buy American has been the law of the land since 
1933, but for far too long, past Administrations have found a 
way to get around it. Not anymore.
    You are about to give out billions in Federal funds through 
grants to many agencies. Do we have your commitment to comply 
with buy America, which is statutory, but also with what the 
President is saying about actually complying and not just 
having every agency waive the statute?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Yes. Not only has, as you noted, this 
law has been on the books for a long time, but the President is 
exceptionally, I would argue historically focused on making 
sure that we buy America. And that is something you will see 
throughout the Administration.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you. Senator Hyde-Smith.

                            AVIATION SAFETY

    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you know, 
Mr. Secretary, there have been significant increases in near-
misses and runway incursions occurring all over the country. 
And whether it is Texas, California, Massachusetts, or most 
recently here in Washington, D.C., these incursions are not 
subsiding and they are very alarming.
    According to data we received from the FAA, in calendar 
year 2022, there were 1,696 runway incursion incidents. And 
since the beginning of this year, we have already had 266 
runway incursions incidents.
    Even with the significant investment Congress provided the 
FAA in fiscal year 2023, we are still seeing very concerning 
unacceptable numbers. And you yourself just recently expressed 
your concerns about the FAA's lack of accountability for these 
runway incursions at last week's safety summit.
    But knowing that most of us here in the Senate, we fly on a 
weekly basis and we certainly encounter our own flight mishaps, 
from cancellations due to mechanical problems or crew staffing 
problems. It just seems that it is just another reason to be 
concerned about the safety of the traveling public.
    Given this committee has been providing funds to address 
runway incursions specifically for several years, why are 
existing safety measures that have been previously used to 
mitigate these incursions no longer--are no longer effective?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, I do want to emphasize the 
effectiveness of our safety systems in terms of maintaining an 
aviation system that is exceptionally safe, while recognizing 
that we can't just rest on that without continually working to 
raise the bar.
    What I mean by that is that while it is an extraordinary 
fact that in a typical year, the number of passengers losing 
their lives in commercial aviation crashes is zero, we need to 
be just as animated and just as energized about these near 
misses.
    Now, the runway incursion numbers that we pay the most 
attention to are the severe ones. They are called category A or 
B, and there is a definite increase in those types of 
incidents. In past years, they have occurred at a rate of 
roughly once per month. Right now, they are, this year, 
occurring at a rate that is roughly double that. And of course, 
the only number we want to see, again, is zero.
    This is why the FAA convened the safety summit last week, 
took a number of steps and is continuing to take steps, 
including this week what is called a SAFO or a safety alert 
going throughout the system to encourage a higher degree of 
vigilance, while we are also looking at engineering solutions 
that might make a difference.
    We think that the uptick is partly related to the 
exceptionally fast surge in demand and the swift return to the 
skies, faster than even the most optimistic scenarios that we 
heard a couple of years ago. We need to make sure, of course, 
that as that system comes back to that high level of demand, 
there is no negative safety impact to that.
    We don't take for granted for a second the safety record of 
U.S. aviation and will continue to be focused on maintaining 
that. And that is reflected in the budget with our requested 
funds for system modernization, also for increased staffing in 
air traffic control so that there is less pressure on the 
existing workforce. And we know that that demand is only going 
to grow.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. And so, you think that with the request 
that you have in now, you think that that would help mitigate a 
lot of this?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Yes, I think that will keep us on 
track for continuing to make the improvements that need to be 
made. The FAA is rightly concerned with maintaining gains from 
the past, yet not thinking that that is enough, or as I have 
heard it put in memorably, viewing safety never as a 
destination, that you get there and then you are satisfied, but 
as a continual journey. These funds will help us to take 
another fiscal year's worth of step on that journey.

                   SAFE DRIVER APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM

    Senator Hyde-Smith. Okay. And one thing that I want to ask 
you about, because it is really important. There is such a 
driver shortage in the trucking industry. And last month, the 
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration provided my staff 
with the participation data for the Safe Driver Apprenticeship 
Pilot Program, which I was really excited about because 
hopefully we can meet the needs of this.
    Boy, we have learned a lot after COVID with the supply 
chains, but this three-year pilot program was included in the 
infrastructure law and is based on the Drive Safe Act, and that 
I co-sponsored last Congress.
    Outside of this pilot, current law prevents 18- to 20-year-
old from operating a commercial motor vehicle in interstate 
commerce. This means that a 20-year-old driver in Mississippi 
is allowed to drive more than 350 miles from Gulfport, 
Mississippi, to South Haven at the very Northern end of the 
State but cannot drive the extra mile from South Haven to 
Memphis, Tennessee, which is right there.
    And obviously a great need right there. This makes little 
practical and economic sense to me. But although the pilot 
program is intended to accommodate up to 1,000 carriers and 
3,000 enrolled apprentices at any given time, the initial 
participation data is just alarmingly and underwhelming.
    At the time of the presentation from the FMCSA, only 21 
carriers had been approved for participation and four 
apprentices were in the program. One, two, three, four. We 
could take up to 3,000.
    So, some in the trucking industry have indicated that 
burdensome program requirements, which were not included in the 
Drive Safe Act nor the infrastructure bill, are a major 
deterrent to carrier participation.
    For example, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration (FMCSA) requires participants to install inward 
facing cameras on themselves in the vehicles, which invites 
legitimate concerns about privacy. And if the participation 
rate remains this low for it, it is unlikely that the pilot 
will provide enough credible data to inform future policymaking 
on this issue.
    So, what are DOT and the FMCSA doing to improve 
participation in the program and to ensure that requirements 
hindering enrollment are removed? Because this is huge to 
Mississippi. We need drivers.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, the FMCSA is hard at work 
launching this pilot. We were able to take applications 
beginning last summer. And as you noted, I think it is up to 22 
motor carriers are approved.
    We got another 22 that have been approved by FMCSA and are 
just working through the process. So far, we agree, we would 
like to see a higher level of participation.
    So, some steps on that have included making information 
available to 1,500 carriers who meet the safety requirements. 
FMCSA did that some weeks ago. There is also a paid media 
campaign that took place in February that we are hoping will 
build interest. And we will continue using social media and 
outreach to the high school graduating class of 2023 about this 
program.
    Any requirement that is in the program is for the purpose 
of safety. And safety will always be our first priority. But we 
are very interested in getting the level of participation that 
will get us good data to see if we can continue in this 
direction without compromising safety.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you. Because that that is a real 
concern when I saw those numbers, that that is a really concern 
there. Okay, I will save my questions for another round and 
give somebody else an opportunity now.
    Senator Schatz. Senator Coons.

                   AMTRAK FUNDING AND INFRASTRUCTURE

    Senator Coons. Thank you, Chairman Schatz, Ranking Member 
Hyde-Smith, Vice-Chair Collins. Welcome, Secretary Buttigieg. 
Look forward to talking with you this morning. Let's start, if 
we can, with rail.
    Rail is a real concern for my community. We have one of the 
busiest passenger rail stations in America named for our 
President, but we also have very busy freight rail lines that 
run up and down the backbone of the East Coast.
    I appreciate your continued work to implement the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is benefiting the State of 
every Senator. But we have to continue to provide robust 
funding for DOT programs in order for us to actually achieve 
the vision of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. On Amtrak, 
America's passenger rail system, you are requesting a 20 
percent increase over our fiscal year 2023 enacted levels.
    In no area of transportation do I think your phrase in your 
opening statement, decades of disinvestment, is it more real 
than in our rail infrastructure, something that has been 
tragically highlighted in recent weeks.
    I will lead the letter endorsing Amtrak's $3.65 billion 
request to ensure robust funding of the Northeast Corridor and 
our national network. And as I have previously raised, Amtrak's 
funding needs were not addressed by the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Act.
    There was a significant and helpful down payment, but the 
framing assumed steady annual appropriations. This is something 
I rely on for my transportation to and from work, so it is 
particularly personal to me. I know for 36 years, our President 
also commuted by rail, as do millions of others across our 
country.
    How can we continue to support Amtrak and ensure the 
Northeast Corridor is a reliable, safe means of transportation?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, Amtrak is a vitally important 
economic asset to the entire country, certainly with regard to 
the Northeast Corridor. And as you mentioned, our President 
famously is enthusiastic and focused on this, as is the 
Administration. Amtrak will be growing its workforce and will 
have to in order to be able to make good on the opportunities 
that are coming by way of the investments and implementing the 
$22 billion in advance appropriations provided by the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, while, as you noted, 
requiring more resources for many of the things that I think 
passengers, customers, and communities expect.
    I know that they had, last time we checked in February, 
nearly 20,000 workers. They have set a goal to hire almost 
4,800 more in 2023.
    So whether it is the physical infrastructure side, where we 
as a Department are most likely and most often partnering with 
them, whether it is the workforce growth that they need to 
undertake, or a third area I would point to, that is important 
in terms of the reliability of the system, less on the 
Northeast Corridor, but overall, which is ensuring that the 
legal requirement of the freight railroads to make way for 
passengers is met.
    I think all of these will continue to need sustained 
attention, and we welcome opportunities to work with Congress 
to make sure that the funding and the authorities align.
    Senator Coons. Thank you. Delaware has long been a site of 
significant Amtrak operations, both the Wilmington shops and 
the Bear shops for repair and maintenance. We have the National 
Operation Center, and DOT recently gave a railroading 101 
program grant to our State Department of Labor, which--I am 
sorry, the U.S. Department of Labor gave our State Department 
of Transportation a grant to try and help grow future 
railroading workforce.
    As the ranking member noted in trucking, we have a real 
challenge, but we also do in railroading, in order to take 
advantage of construction, maintenance, and operations 
opportunities. Let me also ask you about heavy trucks and 
hydrogen. Senator Cornyn and I are co-sponsors, along with six 
of our colleagues, bipartisan co-sponsors of the Hydrogen for 
Trucks Act.

                       SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION

    It would accelerate the deployment of clean hydrogen to 
decarbonize heavy duty transport. Fuel cell trucks have all the 
benefits of diesel-powered trucks, but without the emissions. 
But in the early stages of deployment of promising fuel cell 
technologies, there is going to be a need to lower cost 
barriers and to provide both gathering critical data so that 
what is manufactured and deployed is demonstrably safe and 
better understood, and to provide some incentives for early 
adopters.
    How is the Department thinking about supporting operators 
interested in adding hydrogen fuel cell trucks to their fleets? 
And do you think the kind of incentive program that is laid out 
in my bipartisan bill with Senator Cornyn would be helpful to 
accelerating adoption of these vehicles?
    Secretary Buttigieg. We welcome the work that you and your 
bipartisan colleagues are doing because it is another piece of 
the puzzle of having more sustainable transportation for the 
future. It is one thing for light duty vehicles, cars we all 
own that we have existing on the street available technology 
that is zero emissions.
    The story is more complex for buses and I would add--for 
trucks rather, but I would add buses to that. And in addition 
to some of the tools we do have to work with, like the charging 
and fuel infrastructure discretionary grant program we just put 
out, and the FTA's work on the bus side, I would certainly be 
interested in continuing to partner with you on expanding the 
availability and the support for hydrogen, because we know, as 
you look at the harder to decarbonize elements of our 
transportation systems, surface for sure with the trucks and 
buses, but also as we look ahead to the long term future of 
aviation and shipping, there is no question that hydrogen will 
be an important thing to consider.
    Senator Coons. Well, we have a number of critical companies 
doing cutting edge research and development and deployment in 
hydrogen for transportation ad otherwise in Delaware, and some 
great opportunities.
    I recently had a chance to ride in a heavy-duty truck on I-
95 from Newark to Wilmington and was really struck at how far 
along this technology is. Let me close by thanking you for the 
$270 million investment in Federal Railroad Administration 
(FRA) safety initiatives that is in the budget.
    After the tragic derailment in East Palestine, we want to 
work together with you and with the bipartisan group of my 
colleagues who are proposing improvements in rail safety, and I 
want to make sure that we stay engaged in this as a Congress. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Schatz. Vice-Chair Collins.
    Senator Collins. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Before 
I go to my questions, I want to welcome the new ranking member 
of the subcommittee, Senator Hyde-Smith. She will be an 
absolutely terrific partner for you.
    And I can assure you, Senator that Chairman Schatz will 
also be a great partner. I have been either the chair or 
ranking member of the subcommittee for many, many years, and it 
is great to know that it is in such good hands, and those 
compliments do not count against my time.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Schatz. Noted.
    Senator Collins. Thank you.
    Senator Schatz. Compliments never count against you.
    [Laughter.]

                 INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAMS FUNDING

    Senator Collins. Mr. Secretary, welcome. The Administration 
is proposing once again to zero out important programs like the 
Bridge Formula Program. In fiscal year 2023, Congress provided 
more than $1 billion in funding for the Bridge Formula Program, 
which benefits many rural states, including my State of Maine.
    As you know, this is a program that was created by this 
very subcommittee, and it has been very effective in improving 
and replacing our nation's deteriorating bridges. In addition, 
as the ranking member has pointed out, the budget includes no 
funding for the popular and effective RAISE Grant Program.
    This program, too, has been essential to roadway bridge 
replacement and port projects across the country, including in 
my State of Maine. The budget request instead is shifting these 
important programs to be funded solely by the bipartisan 
infrastructure funding rather than complementing annual 
appropriations.
    I was one of the ten negotiators of the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Act, and I can unequivocally state that the 
funding from that historic law was intended to be supplemental. 
It was not intended to supplant the regular appropriations.
    So, proposing to eliminate the annual appropriations not 
only conflicts with clear Congressional intent, but also 
dilutes the impact and limits to reach of the program. And I 
must say, the Administration has been very quick to laud the 
bipartisan infrastructure program to take credit for its role 
in shaping it, but now it submitted a budget that dilutes its 
impact. Can you explain to me why you are allowing for 
supplanting the funding rather than following congressional 
intent?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, let me first associate myself 
with your remarks about the RAISE program, which is both 
popular and highly effective. And in my travels in particular, 
as I visit communities where we have been able to fund projects 
through that program, you can see the effect that it has.
    Likewise, we continue to enthusiastically pursue the 
deployment of the funds that are available to us in the Bridge 
Program and others that were contemplated both in the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and could be subject to 
future opportunities for appropriation as well.
    Of course, it is challenging in any budget to make sure 
that the top line conforms with the President's and the 
public's and the Congress's expectations about fiscal 
responsibility. We sought to strike that balance in the right 
way, ensuring that there are additional funds for projects, 
including in discretionary programs that we know are very 
sought after across the country.
    But you have my commitment that our Department will 
continue, whether it was RAISE, the Bridge program, or others, 
to make the absolute most of the funding that we have by way of 
that advance appropriation, and continue the dialog about how 
to make sure that needs are met, balanced, of course, with the 
fiscal responsibility concerns that you all must balance in 
your appropriating role.

                NATIONAL SECURITY MULTI-MISSION VESSELS

    Senator Collins. Let me bring up another issue. I met this 
week with the State Maritime Academy Presidents to talk about 
the state-of-the-art training vessels that we have been 
appropriating. They are technically called the national 
security multi-mission vessels. And this subcommittee worked 
really hard to replace them in order of age.
    We did one per year and we have now funded all five, with 
the first being scheduled to be delivered later this year. And 
yet, the President's budget does not include funding to 
continue the support for the shoreside infrastructure 
improvements at our nation's State maritime academies that are 
necessary for berthing these newly constructed vessels.
    And I don't understand that because we are not going to get 
the benefits to the cadets, nor to the Merchant Marine, nor to 
our military, nor to our nation in general, if the 
Administration doesn't help fund the infrastructure required to 
accommodate and operate these ships. Why did the Administration 
slash this account? And I use the word slash advisedly.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, we are excited about what these 
NSMVs and these are going to mean for the future of the 
Merchant Marine, for the cadets, and for the country. We are 
very much looking forward to construction and delivery 
proceeding.
    The President's budget for 2024 includes $19.2 million to 
cover some unanticipated steel cost increases for one of the 
vessels that continues funding for the program and also 
flexibility for management of the fleet following the 
construction and delivery of the vessels and through their life 
cycle.
    But there is, I think, going to have to be a continued 
conversation about the responsibilities on the vessel itself 
and then the shoreside resources. We provided notification last 
month of our intent to obligate fiscal year 2022 funds for some 
improvements that will be needed on the shoreside.
    But I think we do need to continue that dialog with the 
Maritime Academy so that there is a clear, predictable, and 
responsible balance between what is provided by the United 
States Maritime Administration (MARAD) and what is provided at 
the academy level to make sure that there is appropriate 
shoreside support.
    Senator Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have many more 
questions, but I would ask to submit them for the record.
    Senator Schatz. That is fine. And we are going to try to do 
a second round if the time permits. Senator Van Hollen.

                        RECONNECTING COMMUNITIES

    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you 
for mentioning the terrible crash we had in Baltimore County at 
I-695 yesterday. Mr. Secretary, thank you for acknowledging 
that as well. Six people were killed in a construction worker 
zone. I am pleased, Mr. Secretary, that the National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating that crash 
and we all look forward to improving road safety to avoid these 
terrible tragedies.
    On a much happier note, I want to thank you and the 
President for your work implementing the infrastructure 
modernization bill. It was good to have you and the President 
in Baltimore for the announcement of the $4 billion investment 
to upgrade a 150-year-old tunnel and replace it with the new 
Frederick Douglass Tunnel.
    That is going to cut down on Amtrak train times between 
Baltimore and D.C. by a huge amount and make it much more 
efficient and safe for travelers. I was also very pleased that 
the Department of Transportation awarded Baltimore City $2 
million in a planning grant under the Reconnecting Communities 
Program.
    You and I, Mr. Secretary, have spoken about this project 
many times. There was a gross injustice committed in the 1960s. 
A highway was begun through West Baltimore, displacing over a 
thousand homes, cutting right through an African American 
community.
    And then the highway was stopped, never completed, but the 
scar remained. So, this is a very important project. And as you 
know, the Reconnecting Communities Program was included in the 
infrastructure bill, specifically with the Highway to Nowhere, 
West Baltimore in mind.
    That is why we worked to establish the program 
legislatively and then inserted it into the infrastructure 
bill. So first, I want to thank you and the Department. This is 
obviously the first step in making sure that we reconnect that 
community. Finally, I wanted to mention the red line in 
Baltimore.
    This was a major transit project in Baltimore City that had 
been supported by the Maryland delegation for years. Our 
immediately past Governor pulled the plug on that, even though 
we had lined up the billion dollar funding to move forward with 
the project.
    Our new Governor, Wes Moore, is very interested in moving 
forward, as is Mayor Scott. Senator Cardin and I included 
language in the infrastructure bill just highlighting the 
importance of this project and making clear that full 
consideration should be given to previous projects that were 
pretty much ready to go in the event they are resubmitted. So, 
I just want to put that again on your radar screen.

                         TRANSIT WORKER SAFETY

    My question relates to the Transit Worker Pedestrian 
Protection Act. This is something I worked on, had legislation. 
We also included it in the infrastructure bill. And the purpose 
is to establish a safety committee made up of union 
representatives and management representatives in transit 
agencies in order to make sure that we deal with transit worker 
safety and protection, and pedestrian protection.
    This is a serious problem. Last week we had a hearing in 
the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs committee where we had 
testimony from the President of Baltimore's ATU Local 1300. The 
night before the hearing in the Banking committee, he had been 
in a hospital in Baltimore visiting with a fellow transit 
worker who had been stabbed twice on the job. So, it just 
highlighted the urgency of implementing this program.
    In Baltimore, things are moving ahead. As of last week, the 
information we had was one-third of ATU's bargaining units 
reported that management had not established the Joint Safety 
Committee. As of this morning, apparently, we have made some 
progress. There is still, however, dozens left, Mr. Secretary.
    And according to ATU, they are being told in many cases by 
local transit agencies that it is ATU's job to do this when 
clearly it is FTA's responsibility to make sure that this 
provision of law is implemented.
    And the law also says that those transit agencies should 
not be getting any grant funding for other programs until this 
is done. So, I just ask for your commitment today to make sure 
that we swiftly and fully implement that provision.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thanks. You have that commitment. We 
have communicated to the agencies that they need to certify 
that they have one of these committees stood up. If they don't, 
that puts their access to Federal funding at risk. We need to 
be doing everything we can to protect transit workers.
    And let's make clear that it is completely unacceptable to 
have any kind of assault, violence, threats, or intimidation 
directed against these frontline workers. I have heard these 
same themes in meeting with workers and their representatives. 
This has the attention of the FTA Administrator, has my 
attention as well.
    And we will continue our focus on making sure that transit 
agencies are doing everything they can, and that we are doing 
everything we can.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you, 
Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Schatz. Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary. 
How are your babies?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you for asking. They are doing 
all right.
    Senator Kennedy. As we were talking about earlier, my 
father used to tell me, you will never know love until you have 
a child.
    Secretary Buttigieg. It is a different kind of love.
    Senator Kennedy. It is a different kind of love.
    Secretary Buttigieg. It is a wonderful thing.

                           RULEMAKING PROCESS

    Senator Kennedy. I want to ask you a philosophical 
question, Mr. Secretary. How do you and your team go about 
deciding whether to promulgate a new rule? Let me give you an 
example. Study after study has shown that the number of 
teenagers you have in a car is directly proportional to their 
chance of having a wreck.
    And we have known this for years. I am not recommending 
this rule because frankly I don't know how I would vote on it 
if it came to us. But suppose one of your team members came to 
you and said, look, if we promulgate a rule that you can't 
have--if you have a teenage driver, you can't have more--any 
other teenagers in the car with that teenage driver, how would 
you go about analyzing that?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, in this type of case, it would 
likely reflect the traditional division of labor that we have 
had between the Federal Government and the states, in that the 
Federal Government tends to regulate the design of a vehicle, 
the design of the roads, and safety issues related to that 
physical infrastructure in the physical vehicle. While State 
DMVs and State laws tend to regulate the conduct of a driver.
    So, the very thing you are mentioning, for example, I 
think, is why in some states there is a gradual approach where 
when you have your learner's permit, you can be behind the 
wheel. But there are restrictions on who could be in the 
vehicle with you for exactly that reason.
    I know you are asking this philosophically, not in terms of 
the particular policy that you are using as an illustration, 
but to zoom out more generally, we would look as my answer up 
to now, might indicate, at our authorities and our 
responsibilities. We'd look at the data and where it leads us.
    We look at what we think is likely to happen if we were to 
promulgate a rule like that. And then of course, we would get a 
lot of feedback. We would make sure that we have an 
understanding of what the different stakeholders think is 
important, information we might not be privy to.
    Now, having said all of that, the truth is it is rarely the 
case that we imagine a rule and go out into a universe as a 
blank slate and find out what might happen around it. Usually 
there has been dialog, debate, and data building up for years 
that makes a potential rule rise higher on the list of a 
Department that can only take so many regulatory steps at a 
time.
    And of course, it is also working to revise and 
occasionally withdraw older rules that are still on the books. 
But hopefully that gives you some sense of the approach that we 
would take, and that we do take, when we are thinking about our 
rulemaking authorities.

               LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS CENTER OF EXCELLENCE

    Senator Kennedy. Okay. I want to get in one other question 
while I have time. In the fiscal year 2021 in our 
appropriations bill, we created, we meaning Congress, a 
national center of excellence for liquefied natural gas safety.
    And the statute, I will just quote it to you. It is short. 
``In determining,'' this is what the statute says, ``in 
determining the location of the center, the Secretary shall'' 
not may but shall ``locate the center in the State with the 
largest Liquefied natural gas (LNG) production capacity as 
determined by the total capacity and billion cubic feet per day 
of LNG production authorized by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act as of the 
date of enactment of this Act.''
    That is Louisiana. Louisiana has a production capacity of 
21.2 billion cubic feet a day. Your Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration doesn't seem to want to locate 
the center in our State, my State. Can you tell me why, if you 
know.
    Secretary Buttigieg. I will have to consult with the 
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to 
understand the latest on that center of excellence. But I can 
certainly tell you that we, of course, ensure any choice we 
make is conforming with statute. And so, I want to make sure 
that whatever is underway is consistent with the law as 
written.
    Senator Kennedy. If you would look at it. I know you have a 
lot of things on your plate, but the law is pretty clear. And 
personal preference is not supposed to enter into this, and I 
think my State is clearly number one in production capacity. 
And I have noticed a determined reluctance by some of your 
agency folks to make this decision and put it in my State. Now, 
I would much rather just tell them have them be upfront and 
tell me why.
    Secretary Buttigieg. I will make sure to find out.
    [The information follows:]

    PHMSA is making immense progress in establishing a Liquefied 
Natural Gas (LNG) Center of Excellence in accordance with the 
legislation, and PHMSA agrees with your interpretation of the 
calculation as outlined in the statute.
    On April 28, 2023, PHMSA personnel met with your staff to provide 
an update on the agency's activities related to establishing and 
determining a location for the Center. The agency continues to evaluate 
suitable sites in Louisiana, including existing Federal buildings, 
universities, and private facilities. PHMSA is also reaching out to 
other Federal agencies with a stake in LNG facility operations and 
safety, including the Department of Energy, Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, and U.S. Coast Guard, to query their interests in 
collaborating with DOT regarding the Center's establishment, and/or 
maintaining a continued presence throughout the life of the Center.
    Additionally, PHMSA will host an ``LNG Center of Excellence 
Webinar'' on May 17, 2023, to share information with stakeholders on 
the purpose of the Center, activities completed to date, and provide 
instruction on how to submit comments to inform decisions on the 
Center's establishment and future direction.

    Senator Kennedy. Thank you.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thanks, Senator.
    Senator Schatz. Chair Murray.
    Senator Murray. Well, thank you very much, Chair Schatz and 
Ranking Member Hyde-Smith. I look forward to working with you 
and Vice Chair Collins and all the members of this subcommittee 
as we return to regular order and work to find common ground to 
build a strong, competitive economy for families across our 
country.
    Today's hearing is really an important opportunity to 
assess what resources that is going to require, and it does 
come amid some very stark reminders that keeping our country 
strong means keeping our infrastructure strong. We all know 
about the recent train derailment and spill in East Palestine, 
Ohio.
    There was also one last week in the Swinomish Tribal 
Reservation in my home State of Washington, and we have seen 
some disturbingly close calls in air travel lately. So, as we 
are writing the funding bills for this year ahead, we 
absolutely have to remember that keeping our families safe and 
our nation competitive is, of course, about defense spending, 
but it is also important to remind ourselves that safety and 
our families' safety is dependent on non-defense spending as 
well.
    And when it comes to protecting our families, we have to 
make sure that our people and our goods get safely and 
efficiently from point A to point B, and when it comes to 
keeping our economy competitive, we can't compete with China 
without well-run ports who ship American goods out to the 
world.
    And I am proud to say my home State of Washington has some 
of the best. We know we can't compete without strong public 
transportation networks that connect our communities and are 
accessible to everybody, and strengthen our local economies, 
and get people to work and school and more.
    And of course, we can't compete when it comes to clean 
energy and reducing emissions without investing in green 
transportation. So, this bipartisan infrastructure law that we 
passed laid a really good, strong foundation for an 
infrastructure decade.
    And now we have to build on that to make sure that we can 
compete the projects--complete the projects in our communities 
that are so badly needed, like the I-5 bridge project in 
Southwest Washington you are well aware of or expanding Sound 
Transit's light rail system. So, I look forward to hearing more 
from Secretary Buttigieg about why projects like this are 
important and what we need to keep that momentum going.

                       HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY

    But I wanted to ask you today about the recent derailments 
in Ohio and in my State, and how they really demonstrate some 
significant vulnerabilities in our nation's rail system. We 
have been here before with crude oil incidents, and I worked 
with the Administration then through this subcommittee 
actually, to require comprehensive oil spill response plans and 
funding to improve safety practices and training for our short 
line and regional railroads.
    Secretary, there are just a few examples of steps we took 
to increase safety around crude oil. Could you expand those 
efforts now for other hazardous materials?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Thank you for your attention to this 
issue and for the question. The short answer is yes. Often what 
happens is that America learns from an experience of disaster, 
and I know that your work and others on this committee was part 
of responding to some horrific crashes, derailments, and 
incidents that took place in the early 2000s that led to things 
like the creation of the category of the high hazard flammable 
unit train.
    And while that was, I think, a successful response to that 
type of tragedy, questions arose in the wake of East Palestine 
from people who asked a very reasonable question, looking at 
that horrific smoke column and fireball coming out of the vinyl 
chloride controlled burn, that if this train did not meet the 
legal or technical definition of a high hazard flammable train, 
what would?
    And so I think this is compelling us to revise and review 
both the high-hazard flammable unit train (HHFUT) definitions 
in particular, and then more broadly, the authorities and the 
definitions that we are working with, some of which are in 
statute, and we welcome the legislation on a bipartisan basis 
that is emerging in this chamber to do some things that we 
think are important from stiffer fines for safety violations, 
to specific concrete technical measures that could make a 
difference. We are also acting with the authorities that we do 
have.
    Recent safety advisories on valve caps for tank cars are 
just one example. And are calling on industry not to wait for 
us to require of them to do the right thing on their end. And 
with regard to your question here, I would point to the 
importance of early notification for communities when hazardous 
material is passing through them.
    That is still not as rigorous as we believe it ought to be. 
But legislation would raise the bar on that, but I don't think 
that industry should wait for legislation, we certainly won't, 
to view that as the right thing to do.

                              RAIL SAFETY

    Senator Murray. Yes. Well, I know this budget was prepared 
before those derailments, but can you talk a little bit how you 
are using existing resources to increase rail safety and maybe 
what is in this budget that will help you with that?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Yes, well, the budget was proposed 
before the East Palestine tragedy or crash took place. It 
already reflects a number of steps that we have been wanting to 
take or expand, including growing FRA's capacity with regard to 
railroad safety. And I would divide that into a couple of 
relevant categories. One has to do with enforcement and 
compliance, but in another, research.
    So, for example, the wayside detection devices that could 
have played a role here are something that have been developed 
partly through collaboration with the FRA, and obviously we 
need to continue looking at how that technology could help to 
prevent future derailments and crashes.
    So, it is certainly reflected here in the budget, 
increasing the agency's railroad safety personnel, expanding 
inspection and audit capabilities, enhancing data analysis that 
will help us identify root causes, and better interpret the 
NTSB data that comes as they do their independent work, and 
increasing the stakeholder outreach and partnerships.
    And just to give you one example of what is in the budget, 
there is $17 million for the automated track inspection program 
and $4.5 million to support efforts to expand the confidential 
close call reporting system, which we think is important.
    And of course, we will continue evaluating what else could 
make a difference as we look to the future.
    Senator Murray. Well, thank you very much. And I will 
submit my remaining questions for the record, but really 
appreciate your being here. And again, look forward to working 
with you as we put this bill together.
    Senator Schatz. Thanks very much, Chair Murray. Senator 
Capito.
    Senator Capito. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member. 
And thank you for having the initial hearing. And it is good to 
see you again, Mr. Secretary. If this had been last year, you 
and I went round and round over the Federal Highways memorandum 
of guidance in terms of where dollars should be spent.
    And we had a disagreement, but I am glad to see you saw the 
light and pulled the memo down because it was causing a lot of 
angst in terms of our State DOTs being able to move forward. 
So, I also want to thank you. Shailen Bhatt has been very 
conversing with us and many other members here in the Senate, 
and I am glad to see we have a permanent person in there, now a 
confirmed person.

                       GRANTS MANAGEMENT PROCESS

    So, he is doing a good job. But I am hearing that some of 
the project grant agreements across--are taking increasingly 
longer to complete. These types of delays can obviously cause 
project costs, delay much, and you know the time's ticking on 
the infrastructure bill. I am also told that the grant debriefs 
for people that don't get granted, that are offered by the 
Department are becoming less and less helpful.
    So historically, these have been able to equip our 
applicants to be able to reapply in the following years to have 
a much more successful and impactful application. So, I would 
hope that, I am concerned about just the delays and then these 
debriefs.
    I want to bring them to your attention because they are 
being brought to my attention and ask that you would identify 
additional ways that we can move these projects quicker, and 
also that we can help with the debriefs to make sure they are 
as substantive as they can be.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thanks. The goal of compressing 
the timeline between an award announcement and a grant 
agreement is one that I enthusiastically share. There are a 
number of steps, of course, that have to happen and it is 
taxpayer money, but we have got to find ways to streamline that 
process without losing any of the fidelity to the reasons why 
it is there.
    And that is something that we take very seriously, because 
we want to get not just the projects identified, but, of 
course, to get them built. Now, some steps that we have already 
taken to try to ease that include steps to reduce the number of 
independent processes and consolidate them, and to work with 
project sponsors as they are getting through NEPA, for example.
    We will often have a project that has not yet finalized its 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process, but already 
identified for funding. We need to make sure--or sometimes they 
don't even have the engineering, the final design work done.
    And that can be necessary to sign a grant agreement. So, we 
are going to do everything we can on our end. But we also want 
to work with project sponsors to help them do what they have to 
on their end, recognizing that even if it is a requirement that 
they must meet, we are not going to sit back and just say, you 
are on your own, good luck meeting those requirements. We 
really want to partner with them to get that done.
    Likewise, with the debriefs that is something that I 
consider very important for unsuccessful project applicants who 
often turn into successful applicants later on. Would love 
offline to get more information about some of the specific 
feedback you are getting, so that we can examine that and make 
sure the process is useful.
    Senator Capito. Right. Okay. So, it seems that it is-- 
while the desire may be to shorten, it seems as though the 
desire is not quite being met because it is becoming 
increasingly long.

                          ONE FEDERAL DECISION

    So, let's talk about One Federal Decision that is in the 
IIJA. We are looking at this hopefully in a permitting and 
energy and other projects. Again, concerns as to whether you 
are adhering to one Federal decision, whether it is working the 
way it is supposed to, because this is supposed to be--
shortening the timelines is supposed to be more efficient.
    It is not skirting any environmental regulations at all. 
And I don't know, I have frustrations on it and I don't want to 
recommend it in a permitting bill. If we can't, you are sort of 
the test case here and coming up a bit short. So, could you 
speak to one Federal decision?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, we are certainly working to 
implement one Federal decision.
    Senator Capito. But that has been years, right? That has 
been years, even before you got there.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, I know that there was the rule 
version. Now, there is the legislatively mandated version. We 
were able to act within days to get that first provision out 
around the categorical exclusions.
    We are tracking toward those averages that are called for 
by those provisions in the law, and also trying to make sure 
there is more transparency and clarity with our permitting 
processes, including the Federal Permitting Dashboard and the 
interagency organizations that have been set up to try to make 
sure that there is clear information and as smooth a process as 
can be.
    Again, I think part of what is at play here is that it is 
not only the things that we are doing as an agency, and there 
are many, but also how we can make sure the project sponsors 
are able to do what has to happen on their end, especially when 
you are working with newer or smaller communities that may be 
new to receiving Federal funds, but that should be no barrier 
to them succeeding and delivering these projects. And that is 
important to us.
    Senator Capito. Yes, it is pretty discouraging when you 
talk to a Federal agency who can't get-- and I am not saying 
this is DOT, these are different agencies, but they are 
projects that are infrastructure development, roads, water 
projects, and the two agencies aren't even talking.
    You know, where you have to get permits from both of them, 
say, Fish and Wildlife, Corps of Engineers, EPA. That is the 
whole point of one Federal decision, is to pull those in and 
have somebody.
    But I still think there is too much disconnect between 
these Federal agencies. And I am not even talking about how 
they interplay with the State ones or even the private 
developers, because that is an issue as well.
    The least we could do is have our Federal agencies 
interacting and talking with one another to speed the projects. 
So, thank you for working on that. Thank you. Thank you, Madam 
Chair.
    Senator Schatz. Senator Reed.

                              WIND ENERGY

    Senator Reed. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, 
Mr. Secretary, for joining us today. As you probably know, 
Rhode Island is the leader in offshore wind energy in the 
country, and there are several programs that DOT has port 
infrastructure grant programs, the small shipyard program, 
RAISE grants.
    Are you, or how are you structuring or restructuring these 
programs to help accelerate wind energy throughout the country?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, wind energy represents a use 
case that really is newer than some of these programs 
themselves, at least at the kind of scale that is being 
supported by facilities and proposed facilities in Rhode Island 
and elsewhere.
    Certainly, wind related projects have been competing well 
in the Port Infrastructure Development Program, and we have 
seen how RAISE and other potentially other sources of funding 
can be relevant here as well. What we know is that there is 
rising demand and enormous opportunity.
    And part of what I think will be important for us going 
forward is to make sure that our processes reflect not just the 
traditional metrics that we use on a transportation basis, but 
the bigger macroeconomic picture of knowing that if we have the 
right kind of port facilities, we are supporting a 
manufacturing base that is onshore here in the U.S. that can 
create some of this equipment.
    And we recognize the opportunity and the obligation to 
support that economic strength with the particular projects 
that are coming along for consideration.

                        TRANSIT ELECTRIFICATION

    Senator Reed. Well, we are, as you know, because of our 
leadership, doing exactly that, trying to develop manufacturing 
and assembly in our ports and these systems of DOT would be 
helpful. Also, we are trying to electrify our transit system. 
We have a statewide system. I think we might be unique in the 
country.
    And likely will be the first will have a totally electric 
transit system. But supply chain problems, other issues are 
cropping up. How can you help us get to that electrified system 
or hydrogen or hybrid or other non-petroleum products?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, we are aware of this interest 
from the Rhode Island Department and from Massachusetts Bay 
Transportation Authority (MBTA), and that could make for better 
commutes and certainly make for cleaner air as well. I want to 
take care to note that many of the key early decisions are 
local and we respect that.
    But we will certainly say that if there is that local 
commitment coming together in a path forward and if the project 
sponsors are interested in pursuing Federal funding through our 
Capital Investment Grants Program under the FTA, I would 
certainly be happy to take a look and to provide technical 
assistance as they develop that.
    Senator Reed. Thank you. Just a final point. Quonset State 
Airport is very critical both to commercial travel and our 
National Guard. We have a C-130J squadron there. It is 
absolutely not only critical to the State but to the nation, 
and we have been trying to expand that. We have run into some 
problems.
    So, I would ask your commitment to take a look at the 
project at Quonset and see if the Department of Transportation 
could provide any type of assistance to help us get over recent 
complications.
    Secretary Buttigieg. We will make sure to do that.
    Senator Reed. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Senator Schatz. Senator Hyde-Smith.

                            CONTRACT TOWERS

    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do have a 
couple of more questions. Mr. Secretary, I am a strong 
proponent of the FAA contract tower program, and it just helps 
enhance aviation safety at seven small airports in Mississippi 
and around the country.
    However, I have heard concerns that some contract towers 
lack the same type of equipment as the FAA staffed towers, 
which is so much has been focused on our conversations of 
aviation safety and near misses.
    It seems to me that the controllers at contract tower 
airports should have access to the same radar displays and 
other equipment to increase their situational awareness, 
especially as operations continue to rise.
    Can you please tell me what steps the FAA is taking to 
ensure contract towers are properly equipped?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, first, let me make clear that 
the FAA is committed to the contract tower program. We know the 
difference that it can make at a lot of facilities and 
communities. And I should note that the funding request in the 
President's budget ensures that these Federal contract towers 
will have the staffing that is necessary to meet their safety 
mission.
    And for FAA owned facilities, that also goes to equipment 
needs. Now, there are a number of towers in the program that 
have expressed interest in additional or different forms of 
equipment.
    There is currently not a non-Federal system for these 
towers, but we are actively exploring ways to best meet their 
needs, recognizing that there is a different set up and a 
distinct mission that these Federal contract towers meet, but 
wanting to make sure they have everything that is required in 
order for them to meet that mission.

                              RAIL SAFETY

    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you for that. And I want to talk 
a little bit about detectors with the train derailments in the 
East Palestine, Ohio. There has been a renewed focus on rail 
safety, obviously, but specifically on the wayside and hot box 
detectors on train routes. And as you know, trains use these 
detectors to notify the railroad when there is a problem so it 
can be addressed.
    It is my understanding the tracks in East Palestine 
actually had these detectors. But while mandating this 
technology may seem like a good idea now, this technology has 
existed for decades, and I am just concerned that mandating 
just this technology would lock the railroads into using 
outdated technology.
    So new technologies are already being tested, such as 
onboard detectors that would monitor each train car from a 
centralized location. But can you tell me how the 
Administration's budget request is keeping pace with the 
railroads in terms of safety, innovation, and technology using 
this specific?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, the budget request supports FRA 
building the team that is needed for everything from inspectors 
to research and development.
    And I should note, of course, that our work also supports, 
with the funding that has come from Congress, supports the 
physical infrastructure improvements that have benefited rail 
safety through things like our Consolidated Rail Infrastructure 
and Safety Improvements (CRISI) program, and our Railroad 
Crossing Elimination Program.
    But specifically with regard to the wayside detection 
technologies, there are two categories of them, and one is 
those that can detect a developing fault in a rolling stock. 
That is where you have these so-called hot box detectors that, 
for example, can note a difference in temperature in a bearing 
or an axle that could be an indication of a fault. And then 
others that are effectively sounding an alarm, identifying a 
condition that requires immediate attention and actions.
    I don't want to get ahead of the NTSB's findings, which 
will, when the final report comes out, which may take a year or 
more, probably have a higher level of detail. But I will say, 
broadly speaking, our view is that we need more and not less 
rigorous standards for railroad safety.
    And that may include technologies, including wayside 
detection devices. It can also include approaches like the 
added requirements that attach to a high hazard flammable unit 
train, and just better enforcement capability so that we can 
make sure railroads are accountable for their compliance.
    Right now, a multibillion-dollar railroad might face just a 
six figure fine, even if found responsible for an egregious 
violation that resulted in loss of life. And we just don't 
believe that's enough to get their attention. And it is one of 
the measures in the proposed bipartisan legislation here in the 
Senate that we embrace, which is that it would add teeth to 
those enforcement powers.
    So whether it is specifically with regard to wayside 
detection systems or more broadly in terms of the research, the 
enforcement, and the infrastructure improvements that are being 
made, I believe this budget will help us prepare for that, but 
also recognize that this is going to be a journey that has to 
be refreshed and renewed every single year as we learn more 
from conditions on the ground.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you very much.
    Senator Schatz. Senator Moran.
    Senator Moran. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and the Ranking 
Member. Thank you, I am pleased to have the opportunity to work 
with the two of you and others on this subcommittee in my debut 
appearance at T-HUD.
    Mr. Secretary, welcome. Thank you for the series of 
telephone conversations we have had in the last few weeks, and 
I appreciate your presence in front of the committee today. I 
would follow up on what the ranking member had to say about the 
Drive Safe Act.
    It was a piece of legislation that I introduced with a 
number of my colleagues. She indicated the lack of use of that 
program to date. I was glad to hear you indicate you are 
pursuing changes, improvements, alterations in the program to 
make sure that we actually get a lot of young drivers into this 
profession.

                              HAIR TESTING

    And so, I would just reiterate my support. Thank you for 
yours. And if we can be of help in trying to accomplish the 
goals that we mutually share, please put me to work. I am 
surprised, or disappointed that I am once again talking about 
hair follicle testing, which has been a topic of conversation 
since the FAST Act of 2015 was passed.
    Alternative drug testing for truck drivers, the 2015 Fast 
Act required HHS to issue scientific and technical guidelines, 
HHS, for hair testing as a method of truck driving testing 
program with 1 year of its enactment.
    Mr. Secretary, I wonder if you had any update on 
conversations between FMCSA and HHS, anything that is 
progressing or moving this opportunity along?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Let me get an update for you on that, 
Senator. As you note, there is a dependency between our 
authorities in FMCSA, and a finding that would have to come 
from HHS. And we stand ready to work on that as that finding 
comes through, but I will make sure to determine the latest 
state of play there and update you accordingly.
    [The information follows:]

    The Department of Transportation continues to monitor HHS' work in 
implementing Section 5402(b) of the FAST Act concerning hair testing as 
a method of detecting the use of a controlled substance. HHS issued 
proposed Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Using 
Hair (HMG) in 2020 (85 FR 56108 (September 10, 2020)). The Fall 2022 
issue of the Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions 
(https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/
eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202210&RIN=0930-AA33) indicated a Final Rule 
would be used in December 2022. However, the final rule has not been 
issued to date.
    FMCSA leadership met with HHS leadership responsible for issuing 
HMG in February and March of 2023. While HHS' timeline has yet to be 
publicly shared, HHS advised that efforts are currently underway to 
progress further toward finalizing hair testing guidelines for Federal 
Workplace Drug Testing Programs. We defer to HHS to provide an updated 
schedule for issuing the final HMG.

                             CRISI PROGRAM

    Senator Moran. Thank you. Thank you for letting me bring 
that to your attention. Secretary, the short line freight 
industry is critical to communities across Kansas and across 
the country.
    A lot of economic needs. Rail is important to me in Kansas 
for a number of reasons, but one of them is how we help 
agriculture commodities from where it has grown to where it is 
exported or consumed or further refined.
    The CRISI program has been invaluable in helping address an 
estimated $12 billion in investments that is needed to ensure 
that the industry can modernize and meet the needs of the 
country. Any opportunity that you would like to take now to 
discuss your commitment to the CRISI program?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, we begin by saying we are 
committed to the CRISI program. We recognize its importance in 
both the economic and the safety responsibilities that we have 
when it comes to rail infrastructure.
    And I would note that among the $1.4 billion requested for 
FRA's discretionary programs reflected in the President's 
budget, there is a $510 million identified for CRISI Grants, 
which when you add that to the $1 billion in advance 
appropriations that came through IIJA would represent a total 
of over $1.5 billion for the coming fiscal year.
    And as you note, that program can support the safety, the 
reliability, the efficiency of these railroads that are so 
important in every part of the country. We have seen the 
impact, the results, and the enthusiasm in local communities 
for what those represent.
    Passenger rail can even benefit from that when it improves 
rail that is used by Amtrak and hosted and owned by the freight 
railroads. And you will see us continuing to move full steam 
ahead on the use and the deployment of these funds.
    Senator Moran. Thank you. And that has been one of the--I 
hadn't thought of it until you said it, and I highlight it that 
it is one of the ways that we have been able to improve Amtrak 
service through our State, is through CRISI Grants.

                         ADVANCED AIR MOBILITY

    My final question, Chairman, is the continued development 
of advanced air mobility I think is hugely important. The AAM 
Coordination and Leadership Act, which is another--one of the 
pieces of legislation that I have introduced, it became law. I 
introduced it with Senator Sinema.
    It establishes a working group led by DOT to advance this 
emerging technology. It was signed into law last year. Is the 
Department fully engaged to ensure that the success of this 
working group will occur, with its particular focus on mobility 
for passenger carrying aircraft that we intended in that 
legislation?
    And I would ask that in addition to that question, I would 
also ask for your commitment that you and the Department would 
provide me with updates throughout the process of this 
committee doing its work.
    Secretary Buttigieg. We will make sure to do that. And we 
recognize the enormous promise of advanced air mobility and 
that it creates a number of novel questions and challenges that 
are different in kind than what the FAA and the Administration 
are used to managing.
    So the committee, the process that you referenced, and the 
agenda of the FAA more broadly to prepare the airspace for this 
is high on our minds and we will continue pursuing it in ways 
that meet our safety mission while also being compatible with 
the competitive and prompt development of these new 
technologies so that America is a leader, as we are accustomed 
to being, in aviation writ large.
    Senator Moran. A prompt, Mr. Secretary, is my goal in 
raising this topic. We face a competitive world and we want the 
United States to be the leader in this emerging technology.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Agreed. Thank you.
    Senator Moran. Thank you.
    Senator Schatz. Senator Boozman.

                         TRUCK PARKING CAPACITY

    Senator Boozman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for 
being here today and testifying. I know you have got a lot 
going on. I have really just got a couple questions that I 
think are important. Nearly 87 percent of Arkansas communities 
depend exclusively on trucks to move their goods.
    Since the vast majority of my constituents rely on, and 
this is true of so many other areas throughout the country, 
efficient trucking operations, I am really interested in the 
Department of Transportation's long-term plan to build our 
truck parking capacity.
    We have heard repeatedly from representatives of the 
trucking industry that the nationwide shortage of truck parking 
capacity is a key driver of supply chain inefficiency. In fact, 
for every 11 drivers, there is only one truck parking space.
    So, Mr. Secretary, would the establishment of a competitive 
grant program for truck parking projects better equip DOT and 
the states to address the long-standing challenge? And if so, 
or if not, how can we help you accomplish, you know, something 
that really is a major problem now and is probably only going 
to get worse in the future?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, I completely agree with the 
importance of this issue. When you talk with truck drivers, it 
is one of the first things that they will raise. And it is not 
just a matter of convenience, it is really a matter of safety.
    It means that as a driver is on their route, they see that 
they are getting close to the limit of their hours of service. 
They are faced with a choice to either stop short and lose 
income, if there is even a space near them, or to park in a 
place that could be unsafe.

    Senator Boozman. And I don't mean to interrupt, but I am 
told that literally drivers will drive around for an hour, hour 
and a half, you know, trying to find a spot before their hours 
run out so that they will stay, you know, stay within the right 
the timeframe.
    Secretary Buttigieg. That is right, or face being compelled 
to park on those ramps, which is not safe for them or for other 
drivers. So, in terms of a dedicated program, we would welcome 
a dialog on that. I do want to make sure in the meantime, you 
are aware that we are using the funding we do have for these 
purposes.
    We were able, through our Infrastructure for Rebuilding 
America (INFRA) discretionary programs, I believe INFRA but I 
will double check--to fund both Florida and Tennessee working 
on projects to do just this, to add truck parking spaces. And I 
would add there is some interesting technologies developing 
that can help drivers know in real time where some of those 
spaces might be available to avoid just that scenario that you 
are describing of circling around, which benefits no one.
    So, we will continue to consider this a valid use in any 
discretionary program where it is permitted under statute. 
Secondly, we have taken steps to urge State DOTs to recognize 
that this is often an eligible use of their Federal-aid Highway 
Formula Funds. We would love to see more of those funds going 
to that purpose.
    But third, if there is an opportunity to investigate 
dedicated programming, I certainly recognize that that would 
meet a need.
    Senator Boozman. Well, we would really like to work with 
you, and I think I can speak for the committee in the sense 
that this is, you know, such an important area, you know, to go 
forward and help you with the projects that you have got going 
now, but also try and figure out a future way to perhaps, you 
know, help alleviate this.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Likewise.

                         AIR TRAFFIC INVESTMENT

    Senator Boozman. The other thing is the Appropriations 
committee has been diligent over the past several years in 
funding the FAA air traffic organization at or near the 
requested levels in the President's budget.
    With that said, I have heard a lot of aviation stakeholders 
mention the funding is simply not enough to meet the air 
traffic goals. And I note that your budget request includes a 
$1.4 billion increase for FAA, with most of that directed 
towards air traffic. Can you explain where the increased 
funding will be directed if Congress funds the air traffic 
request and the need for that?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Certainly. We see more pressure than 
ever on the national aviation system. Some of that comes from--
by way of economic good news, which is the increased demand and 
interest in flight. But we have to make sure the systems are 
keeping pace. And even if it weren't for that surge, there are 
ongoing needs that we need to make sure that the FAA can meet.
    So, part of what you are seeing in the increase is an $800 
million increase for the operation sides. That includes air 
traffic control hiring and training. You know, we had 1,500 
controllers hired in fiscal year 2023 and we will need the 
funding to continue training them and then project another 
1,800 for fiscal year 2024.
    And even allowing for attrition, that represents an 
expansion in workforce, which I think is very much needed right 
now. There is also funding for the sustainment of the national 
airspace system.
    That is for software maintenance programs and 
telecommunication systems, and trying to reduce the risk of 
system outages. And then a number of other proposals that are 
really about getting ready for the future or addressing 
requirements of the Aircraft Certification Reform Act.
    Now, there is also a $600 million increase in the 
facilities and equipment side. And I want to point in 
particular to $115 million for modernization, which would allow 
us to move forward faster on things like the NOTAMS 
modernization that started in 2019. And phase 1 is set to be 
done in 2025.
    Obviously, we are very interested in how to accelerate 
that, as well as the telecommunications infrastructure, which 
is running on technology that telecom operators tell us they 
will not support indefinitely, and so we really need to make 
that change from time-division multiplexing (TDM) to Internet 
protocol technology.
    Just to give you a flavor of some of the steps. Last thing 
I would point to is research and development, which is an 
important area always for FAA. And of course, this sits 
alongside the airport improvement program funds on FAA's books, 
which allow us to benefit airports of all sizes across the 
country.
    Senator Boozman. Right. Well, thank you, Mr. Secretary. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Schatz. Senator Manchin.
    Senator Manchin. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I 
appreciate it very much. First of all, I want to say I think, 
Mr. Secretary, Senator Hyde-Smith mentioned this about rural 
areas and the funding, and the RAISE, INFRA, rural, and Mega 
grant programs. So, the only thing I want to say that we have 
been trying to, and I am trying to get this, and all of us come 
from rural states.
    20 percent of the population of America lives in rural 
America, it is about 66 million people. And I guarantee you, we 
get less than single digits when all the funding comes from 
Federal. I don't think it is directed or intentionally. It just 
happens because there is so much scale of economies in larger 
areas.
    But we are trying to make sure--so in a situation such as 
this, the $5.2 billion, $1 billion of that should have been 
designated for rural areas to get as per appropriate share. And 
I think if you look, it didn't happen that way.
    Various large cities got most of it. But I want to bring 
that to your attention because we are trying to pass an overall 
piece of sweeping legislation that says the 20 percent. So, 
anything you can do to maybe bring your staff up to speed on 
looking at that when we disburse moneys out into rural areas 
would be very, very helpful.

                           ALTERNATIVE FUELS

    On the funding for alternative fuel, refueling stations, 
what we are concerned about there, there is more than just EV 
charging stations that we are concerned about. I am concerned 
about the horsepower that it takes to run the big trucks, that 
runs the things that we need, and that is going to be hydrogen 
as we transition.
    And I hope that you are looking at that as aggressively as 
you are the EVs, that that we are moving very rapidly in, and 
that is going to be needed for us to meet the demands because 
EVs will not carry the trucks and the heavy loads that we need, 
and also on our trains and things of that sort. And I don't 
know if you all have looked at it differently than that.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Sure. Yes, we share your interest in 
hydrogen. One thing I would note is that while the National 
Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program with the states 
is focused on EV infrastructure, the $2.5 billion Charging and 
Fueling Infrastructure Program includes hydrogen as an eligible 
use.
    Senator Manchin. I think you are going to have to push that 
yourself a little bit, sir, take the lead on that because if 
not, it might lag behind because of the overanxious desire to 
get EVs out the door quicker than----
    Secretary Buttigieg. We certainly recognize for trucks. 
Also, I would note for buses, there is a lot of interest.
    Senator Manchin. Yes, you know, this technology goes back 
to the 90s. We had a hydrogen fueling station in West Virginia 
back in the 90s, but then it didn't get the support it needed 
so it went nowhere. We never matured that industry. We are 
determined to get it done this time.

                              RAIL SAFETY

    If I could go to the rail situation, we had a disaster in 
2015, but up until that we have had the electronic control 
pneumatic brakes. And I think you and I talked about it 
briefly. That was started back 9 years, started in 2006. They 
have gone through all the testing and everything, and by 2015, 
we thought we had it. Then we had the wreck in West Virginia 
and now then it was kind of put on the sidelines for the 2016, 
2020 period. So, the only thing I would say, the technology 
exists.
    It has been successfully field tested. And we think that it 
would have been very helpful in preventing some of these 
horrific train accidents. So, the only think I would like for 
you all, and hopefully you would commit to have the Federal 
Railroad Administration to revisit the electronically 
controlled pneumatic brakes (ECP) brakeS system.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thank you for that, and we are 
interested in the ECP brake opportunities. As you know, the 
FAST Act constrains us to some extent in our ability to apply 
it, but I have directed our team to look at everything we can 
do within those constraints, and also would welcome partnering 
with Congress to loosen those constraints.
    I will note now that positive train control (PTC) is fully 
deployed, there would need to be some steps to make sure that 
we get the right compatibility between PTC and ECP. But I 
certainly continue to view this as a potentially--very 
important.

                          AIR PILOT WORKFORCE

    Senator Manchin. If you keep us up to speed basically on 
the technology and what changes have been made and if they are 
adaptable, would be very helpful, and then hopefully we can 
speed that. Pilot shortage, okay. Especially we are affected 
more in rural areas than most because when there is a pilot 
shortage, we are the first routes that get cut because of 
economics.
    As a pilot myself, and I am way above the 67 age, we are 
still able to fly. We can still make pretty good decisions, 
keep our lives, if you will and those of entrusted in--I don't 
know, I would hope that you all would consider the 65 to 67 age 
increasement. It would be very helpful for us to meet the 
challenges we have all over America, especially in rural 
America.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, as you know, that is set 
statutorily and it conforms to the International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) level of 65. And so, any variance from that 
could create international issues, but always looking primarily 
to the data and would want to see any kind of data that could 
inform any measure related to the future pilot workforce.
    We can't and won't do anything that could compromise safety 
but are interested in anything and everything that we could do 
that meets that test, including encouraging and helping more 
people get started.
    Senator Manchin. We have a bill with Senator Graham that we 
think may help you a little bit, so we are going to try to 
pursue that one and hopefully you will take a good look at it 
and see what you think.

                            PIPELINE SAFETY

    Finally, hold on--we have one here on hydrogen. What has 
been included in the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration spending plan to address--and my concerns about 
the safety and blending of hydrogen into existing older 
pipelines. Also, you know, the jurisdictional situation that we 
have with transmission and pipelines.
    We have been contemplating putting it under one roof. And I 
know how staff is maybe territorial on this, but we are 
thinking with FERC, where we have had all our pipelines and 
transmission, we are looking at that for a new permitting bill. 
Really want your input on that, how we can do that, and 
basically synchronize this better.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, we will.
    Senator Manchin. Safety on pipelines first, if you can, and 
get that.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Sure. Yes, we have got the----
    Senator Manchin. I am so sorry, Senator. Thank you.
    Secretary Buttigieg [continuing].-- $228.2 million assigned 
for pipeline safety. That includes operations, R&D on things 
like leak detection and grants to states. We know how important 
those can be. On the structural matter, we would defer to 
Congress, but happy to work with you on that.
    Senator Manchin. Okay. But on the pipelines, the type of--I 
am told we have a lot of pipelines existing right now, also 
that they can carry amounts, up to 20 percent of hydrogen right 
now, the same pipelines. Some of the pipelines can be basically 
retrofitted or what we call sleeved, if you will, a new 
pipeline inside that, as we transition into more hydrogen.
    We are going to need help from you all right now and 
support, if we can use the existing right of ways that don't 
have to go through all the environmental considerations, that 
basically that pipeline is already there, why can't we 
repurpose it for the same purpose that we have now as we 
transition to other fuels?
    So hopefully you all will be looking at that for us. Thank 
you, Secretary, I appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You 
have been so kind.

                                 ARPA-I

    Senator Schatz. No problem, Senator Manchin. I just have 
two final questions. We provided some seed money to begin the 
planning process for Advanced Research Projects Agency-
Infrastructure (ARPA-I). And the President's budget is 
requesting $19 million for the next phase. What are your short-
term accomplishments and your long-term goals for the program?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, thank you. We are very excited 
about ARPA-I. It is patterned after the successful ARPA-E and 
DARPA and ARPA models. They provide advanced research that just 
isn't being met by other bodies, and we think could help lead 
to transformative benefits in transportation areas of interest, 
including safety.
    With the $3.2 million that Congress provided for this 
fiscal year, we have begun the development process to stand 
this up, including a staffing plan and preparing to provide an 
outline of research activities to Congress in the coming weeks, 
followed by a strategic vision that we will seek to get to 
Congress by October.
    And ARPA-I has begun conducting outreach, workshops, and 
other launch activities. With the $19 million requested in the 
fiscal year 2024 budget, we would be able to advance this work, 
fully, build out ARPA-I and begin pursuing projects that could 
make a difference on things like breakthrough intersection 
safety systems, which could reduce fatalities at intersections 
that right now claim 10,000 lives per year in the United 
States.
    So, while this is not the biggest dollar amount you will 
see in the budget, I think it is one of the areas where we may 
see the most bang for our taxpayer buck in the same way that 
the original DARPA famously generated trillion-dollar ideas 
like the Internet itself based on the research funding that was 
provided to them.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you. Senator Feinstein can't join us 
today, but she has a time sensitive question regarding 
environmental protections for the Brightline West Rail Project. 
Can you follow up with her office directly?
    Secretary Buttigieg. We will make sure to do that, 
Chairman.

                       UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS

    Senator Schatz. Thank you very much. Senator Hoeven.
    Senator Hoeven. Mr. Secretary, one of the things that we 
work very hard on in North Dakota is developing the unmanned 
aviation systems in the Grand Forks region. And we have a test 
site there, the Northern Plains test site.
    We work with the Grand Forks Air Force Base. We have a 
technology partner, Grand Sky Technology Park. And so, we have 
developed an incredible partnership and could do a lot more to 
fly unmanned aircraft in the NAS safely and well.
    We have been working with Bill Nolen, the Acting 
Administrator right now. He has been helpful and we appreciate 
it. What can you do to help us continue to advance that 
industry?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, first of all, North Dakota 
really has a lot to be proud of with regard to the research and 
the work that has gone on here. I have spoken with your 
Governor about it, too, and we view it as a major national area 
of interest in aviation.
    These uncrewed aircraft systems, or UAS are, we think, 
going to transform a number of aviation uses, and some of those 
maybe sooner than people think, especially with regard to use 
cases like deliveries to remote or rural areas for urgently 
needed pharmaceutical supplies, something we are supporting a 
little bit of research on through our SMART grants.
    I would direct your attention to the budget request, which 
will total $138.9 million for fiscal year 2024 across different 
activities related to UAS that would advance drone integration 
into the NAS by supporting the development of the policies, the 
procedures, and the standards that we are going to need, 
recognizing that this is just different, related but different 
from traditional crewed aircraft.
    That is going to include partnerships with other agencies 
and with industry on safety. It is going to require clear 
standards on rules on things like beyond visual line of sight 
operations, forecasting, and processing of the different 
authorizations that are going to be needed.
    So, we are enthusiastic about the potential of this 
technology. We also recognize that it is going to create a lot 
of challenges and we will diligently put these requested 
dollars to use advancing that.
    Senator Hoeven. And you committed to helping us develop UAS 
in our test site and for the country?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Welcome to continue to work with you 
on that.

                              SUPPLY CHAIN

    Senator Hoeven. All right. The other issue I want to bring 
up to you is supply chain issues. Obviously, inflation is an 
incredible problem right now. We need to do everything we can 
to get it under control.
    Too much spending here in D.C. is a big part of the 
problem. But the supply chain issues are a huge issue. And that 
involves everything from farmers getting containers, you know, 
loading those containers at the ports, getting adequate truck 
drivers. I just recently saw that the AGC, Associated General 
Contractors said that they are not able to get enough skilled 
tradesmen.
    And, as you know, across the board, we are seeing a real 
challenge with these supply chain issues. Obviously, in some 
cases it is too much regulation. In some cases, they are not 
able to get the people. Just the whole gamut. So, we have got 
to get people back into the workforce. We have got to train 
them expeditiously.
    We have got to make sure that small business doesn't have a 
regulatory burden that holds them back from doing what they 
need to do to knock down these supply chain barriers and get 
this terrible inflation down, which is, as you know, very 
difficult for the American people. What are you doing to make 
sure that we solve these supply chain issues?
    Secretary Buttigieg. Well, I agree this continues to be a 
major concern, and it is driven by a number of factors. 
Certainly, the extremely low unemployment rate right now is a 
factor. And the fact that the economic demand and the growth in 
our economy came roaring back at a pace that even the most 
optimistic scenarios just a couple of years ago didn't 
anticipate, has put strain on the system.
    Let me mention a near-term effort and then a longer-term 
view. The near-term effort that I would invite your attention 
to, is a program called Freight Logistics Optimization Works 
(FLOW). This is by no means the biggest dollar amount you are 
going to see in the budget. It is about $5.3 million requested 
to support eight positions.
    But this emerges from a partnership that we formed with 
industry retailers like Target, Walmart, and Home Depot, 
logistics companies like FedEx, UPS, and DHL. Shippers like 
Maersk and MSC. And ports like Long Beach, Newark, and Georgia 
to make sure that better information and data sharing took 
place.
    And to your point about small business, you know, the very 
biggest firms sometimes have their own supply chains and are 
not feeling the pinch in the same way that, for example, my in-
law's family business does when they can't get the hardware 
that they need on time and can't exactly send a ship to go get 
it.
    We will be able to do more work with this so-called FLOW 
Program that I think will make a big difference. And I would 
also just echo your point that this is connected to the fight 
against inflation.
    Certainly encouraged to see that the cost of ocean shipping 
in the Pacific is down 80 percent because we know that when it 
was at those sky-high rates, that is one of the things that led 
to inflation at its peak that we observed a few months ago. 
There is a long way to go in making sure that we address those 
issues.
    Senator Hoeven. We need to see more help for small business 
to really get through these supply chain issues.
    Secretary Buttigieg. Agreed. And if I could just point to 
one other thing. We are also mindful of this in our 
grantmaking, in the infrastructure work that we are doing, that 
we have got to shore up the infrastructure that those supply 
chains move across, because that is a public responsibility, 
even while we are working to support the private sector, doing 
what it does best.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. Thank 
you for your testimony today. Thank you for your partnership 
with this committee. We have got a lot of work to do to pass an 
appropriations bill, but I am confident that we will get there.

                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    The hearing record will remain open until Friday, April 
7th, to allow members to submit additional questions for the 
record.
              Questions Submitted by Senator Brian Schatz
              
                     aviation consumer protections
                     
    Question. Secretary Buttigieg has been very proactive on aviation 
consumer protection issues, particularly with the unruly behavior from 
passengers during the COVID-19 pandemic and getting airlines to improve 
consumer protections without regulations. The Office of Aviation 
Consumer Protections still receives over 100,000 complaints a year, 
which is 500 percent higher than in 2019. The FY 2023 THUD bill 
provided $1 million for eight new staff in the Office of Aviation 
Consumer Protections. The FY 2024 budget request includes an additional 
$4.6 million for eight additional positions, upgrades to the aviation 
consumer complaint system, and a new rulemaking tracking system to help 
keep Congress and the public aware of the Administration's regulatory 
work.
    In the 2023 Omnibus, this subcommittee provided new positions for 
the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection to help with the increase in 
complaints. What additional resources and authorities are needed to 
improve the flying experience for passengers?
    Answer. As you noted, the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection 
(OACP) is continuing to receive a high volume of air travel service 
complaints--102,561 complaints in 2020 (a 569 percent increase from 
15,332 complaints received in 2019), 49,958 complaints in 2021 (a 226 
percent increase compared to 2019), and 1177,656 complaints in 2022 (a 
406 percent increase compared to 2019). Airlines receive significantly 
more complaints and inquiries directly from consumers. By any measure, 
consumer dissatisfaction with the airlines is very high.
    OACP's mission is to assist and protect aviation consumers by 
processing and analyzing consumer complaints, educating consumers about 
their rights, enforcing aviation consumer protection and civil right 
requirements, and drafting aviation consumer protection and civil 
rights regulations. Currently, OACP consists of a team of 17 attorneys 
(including the Assistant General Counsel), 15 transportation industry 
analysts (TIAs), 3 support staff and paralegal, and 1 consumer affairs 
analyst.
    The DOT is taking action to expand OACP's capacity so it can be 
more responsive to the needs of air travelers and ensure accountability 
for airlines and ticket agents. At a time when aviation consumer 
complaints are at a record high, the need to provide enhanced response 
to the public has never been greater. The DOT recently extended terms 
for 2 part-time reemployed annuitants to handle air travel service 
complaints. The DOT is also continuing to allow overtime for staff 
processing complaints and has reassigned more than 15 DOT employees 
from other offices to assist with complaint handling, enforcement, and 
rulemaking. In addition, DOT expects to hire 8 new staff in OACP in FY 
2023 and has requested another 8 new staff positions in FY 2024 to 
enable it to protect airline consumers against civil rights violations 
and unfair and deceptive practices.

              Questions Submitted by Senator Patty Murray
              
    Question. It's critical funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law is providing opportunities for small and disadvantaged businesses 
in our communities. It's my understanding the Department set a target 
of awarding 20% of Federal contracts to small and disadvantaged 
businesses, which is a great start.
    How is the Department working with the Minority Business 
Development Agency and Small Business Administration to help reach this 
goal?
    Answer. The Secretary signed three memoranda of understanding 
(MOUs) last September with the U.S. Small Business Administration and 
the Minority Business Development Agency to support Departmental 
capacity building and technical assistance efforts to help small and 
disadvantaged businesses (SDB) increase their competitiveness and 
footprint in the Federal marketplace.
    Accordingly, we have taken the following actions:

  --Developed a series of regional events in collaboration with both 
        SBA and MBDA. The ``Advancing Equitable Infrastructure 
        Opportunities Symposiums'' provide an opportunity for small and 
        disadvantaged businesses to learn about upcoming BIL-related 
        projects, funding, available technical assistance, and access 
        to capital programs. These sessions also include a business 
        matchmaking component to connect small and disadvantaged 
        businesses with State DOT procurement officials, prime 
        contractors, and technical assistance providers.

  --Access to Capital

    --Hired a private equity subject matter expert from SBA's Small 
            Business Investment Company (SBIC) program to spearhead 
            OSDBU's Access to Capital Initiative (ACI). This is a 
            targeted effort to bridge the awareness and relationship 
            gaps that persist between SDBs and providers of private 
            capital through moderated Access to Capital panel 
            discussions, SDB introductions to private capital 
            providers, and the development of a Virtual Connector 
            platform that facilitates introductions and meetings of 
            SDBs and private capital providers

    --The Virtual Connector will be an online tool that will screen and 
            optimize matches of SDBs and private capital providers and 
            provide a means for them to coordinate meetings, then track 
            the progression of these burgeoning relationships.

  --Surety Bond Guarantee Program

    --SBA has engaged in data sharing with DOT by providing listings of 
            regional companies which have entered into a relationship 
            with the SBA Office of Surety Guarantees, which in turn 
            have been shared with DOT Small Business Transportation 
            Resource Centers (SBTRC) to assist small business owners in 
            gaining access to skilled SBTRC technical assistance.

    --OSDBU's Bonding Education Program was recently added to SBA's 
            Surety Bond Guarantee (SBG) webpage to help increase 
            program marketing and promotion.

    --SBG staff will join OSDBU Regional Symposiums to provide 
            technical assistance to construction firms.

    In addition, DOT worked to improve tools and policies, as follows:

  --Procurement forecast enhancement and streamline

    --OSDBU expanded the DOT's procurement forecast to include new data 
            fields to assist SDB search for DOT direct contract 
            opportunities.

    --Also, included Federal Aviation Administration forecasted 
            opportunities in the DOT's forecast along SDB to search for 
            DOT-wide opportunities in one location.

  --FAA inclusion of WOSB, SDB and HubZone set asides in Acquisition 
        Management System (AMS).

    --FAA amended its AMS to include set asides for women-owned, small 
            disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms. These policy changes 
            helped the FAA to significantly increase HubZone contract 
            awards in FY 2022.

                                 ______
                                 

            Questions Submitted by Senator Dianne Feinstein
            
    Question. As you know, the FRA is reviewing the proposed $9 billion 
Brightline West high-speed rail project to connect Las Vegas with East 
Los Angeles. The line will go through California's Mojave Desert 
between two national parks, home to various protected and endangered 
species. I recently sent letters to you and Administrator Bose to 
include three wildlife overpasses as required mitigation in the pending 
permit. If left out of the permit, there is no enforceable requirement 
to build the overpasses, and this project will jeopardize protected 
wildlife.
    Will the Department ensure that the NEPA documentation requires 
environmental protections, specifically the three wildlife overpasses?
    Answer. Brightline West's current design includes mitigation 
developed in consultation with the United States Fish and Wildlife 
Service (USFWS) for impacts to Federally endangered species, which was 
included in FRA's September 2020 re-evaluation, and will remain in 
FRA's forthcoming second project re-evaluation.
    In addition to Federally listed endangered species, FRA, through 
the re- evaluation, considered potential impacts to all wildlife, 
including the desert bighorn sheep, mountain lions and other California 
desert species. The Project, as currently designed, will include 
measures to minimize or mitigate impacts to wildlife, such as mirroring 
existing conditions of culverts and bridges to reduce potential effects 
to wildlife movement, including the desert bighorn sheep.
    Brightline West will design bridges, culverts, and fencing in 
coordination with the USFWS, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and 
Caltrans to ensure they meet applicable standards, and are compatible 
with the State's efforts, to the extent feasible.
    The FRA is aware of an agreement between Brightline West, Caltrans, 
and California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) dated January 11, 
2023, to implement wildlife overpasses across I-15. The agreement 
States CDFW prioritized remediation of wildlife barriers where the 
Brightline System will be constructed and identified three priority 
locations. The executed agreement includes Caltrans setting aside funds 
to cover 75 percent of the initial preliminary cost estimate, as well 
as owning and maintaining the three wildlife overcrossings after 
construction. Brightline West will provide design services at no cost 
to Caltrans or CDFW. These dedicated overcrossings will provide a 
sustainable and safe path for wildlife, over the existing I-15 and 
future high-speed rail system to be built within the median. The DOT 
and FRA were pleased to learn about the agreement between the State of 
California agencies and Brightline West.
    Question. Why would FRA not require the overpasses when the science 
clearly shows they are necessary and all the stakeholders say they 
agree?
    Answer. The FRA as part of the NEPA process has independently 
reviewed information provided by Federal and State resource agencies, 
along with information provided by Oregon State University and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). The FRA has coordinated with the 
USFWS to develop mitigation measures associated with Federally 
endangered species including the Desert Tortoise and the Mojave Ground 
Squirrel. These USFWS mitigation measures are included in the NEPA 
documentation. The FRA reviewed potential impacts from the Brightline 
West Project to other Mojave Desert species through the NEPA process, 
which included the desert bighorn sheep, compared to the existing 
conditions to determine if any mitigations are required. I-15 was 
constructed in 1957. Through the NEPA review, FRA understands the 
effect I-15 has had on species that require large ranges, and DOT also 
understands the impacts the interstate system had on not only the human 
environment but the natural environment. The current conditions show 
overcrossings are a rare occurrence and the construction of a rail 
system within the highway median would not result in significant 
impacts from the current state. The DOT supports the agreement put in 
place by Brightline West, Caltrans, and CDFW for three wildlife 
overcrossings, which shares the burden of improving the existing 
conditions for the desert bighorn sheep populations which have been 
segmented by our interstate highway system and potentially the 
Brightline West Project.
    Question. I appreciate the Administration recognizing California's 
unique authority under the Clean Air Act, which grants my state, and 
the 16 other States that have adopted California standards, the 
authority to set ambitious emission standards. However, federally 
regulated sources of air pollution such as seagoing vessels, freight 
locomotives, on-road and off- road heavy-duty vehicles and aviation 
will soon make up a larger share of air pollution than sources subject 
to state regulation.
    Will you continue to work with the EPA and California to set the 
strongest possible standards from all transportation sources?
    Answer. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA), the transportation sector is the leading source of greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions in the country. As such, the Biden Administration 
is pursuing an all-of-government approach to using its authorities to 
reduce GHG emissions-and other air pollutants-across the entire 
economy. The DOT is doing its part to address transportation GHG 
emissions within its authorities and will continue to do so in 
coordination with other Federal agencies, States, and other communities 
and stakeholders, including by collaborating closely with EPA on fuel 
economy standards. The DOT has rulemaking authority and administers 
funding programs that can be used to help reduce emissions from several 
sources. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law created new programs and 
expanded eligibilities and increased funding for some existing 
programs, many of which can address GHG emissions across a variety of 
modes of transportation within DOT's purview.
    In September of 2022, DOT, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, and EPA signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding on decarbonizing the transportation sector, 
demonstrating the Biden Administration's commitment to a holistic and 
collaborative approach to addressing transportation GHG emissions. In 
January of 2023, the agencies released the U.S. National Blueprint for 
Transportation Decarbonization, which outlines strategies for reducing 
GHG emissions from all sources of transportation through collaboration 
among various levels of government and other stakeholders.
    Question. California has aggressive plans to take advantage of the 
historic bipartisan infrastructure bill to transform our mass transit, 
port, and airport systems. This includes Los Angeles' ``28 by 28'' 
plans for the 2028 Summer Olympics, BART's expansion to Silicon Valley, 
California High Speed Rail, improvements to Los Angeles and San 
Francisco airports, and electrification and emissions reduction 
projects at our Nation's largest ports. Some of these projects have 
experienced enormous cost increases resulting from rising material 
prices and lingering supply chain issues.
    How does the Department of Transportation plan to address price 
increases affecting design, funding, and construction plans for DoT 
funded projects?
    Answer. The DOT understands that communities across the Nation have 
unmet transportation infrastructure needs that are critical to 
improving the safety, quality of life, and economic competitiveness of 
our communities. That is why DOT has sought and received a historic 
increase in the amount of discretionary funding available to States and 
localities to construct critical transportation projects across the 
Nation. The DOT has worked with State and local project sponsors to 
provide a large share of Federal funding to support infrastructure 
projects within these communities. In some cases, and as legally 
permissible, DOT has also provided 100 percent of Federal funding to 
eligible applicants that do not have the resources needed for certain 
projects or are impacted by rising costs of construction materials.
    The DOT understands that cost increases can be disruptive to the 
overall planning, design, and construction of infrastructure projects. 
That is why DOT has historically required project sponsors to include 
contingency funding in their financial plans when applying for 
discretionary grant funding to account for unforeseen cost increases 
due to a variety of factors, including inflationary cost increases. 
This practice has proven effective in ensuring that project sponsors 
are able to withstand price increases and complete needed projects. 
Finally, DOT has a strong record of working collaboratively with 
communities to find mutually agreeable solutions and amend grant 
agreements when allowable by law or regulation to address unforeseen 
cost increases or other disruptions to projects awarded transportation 
infrastructure grants.
    In October 2022, the White House hosted the Accelerating 
Infrastructure Summit. At the Summit, the Administration and outside 
organizations announced new efforts and an Action Plan to accelerate 
the rebuilding of our Nation's infrastructure and maximize this once-
in-a-generation opportunity to build a better America.
    As part of the efforts, DOT has launched the USDOT Project Delivery 
Center of Excellence at U.S. DOT's Volpe National Transportation 
Systems Center (https://www.volpe.dot.gov/project-delivery) to support 
and educate transportation infrastructure project managers in States, 
Tribes, local, regional, and territorial governments on project design, 
planning, and construction. It will serve as a central resource for the 
most innovative and effective practices and bring project managers 
together to learn from one another.
    Question. California is home to 40 million people, and we have led 
the Nation in constructing large transit systems that move millions of 
people each year. This includes construction currently underway on the 
Nation's first truly high-speed rail project connecting San Francisco 
and Los Angeles, as well as projects in the Sacramento Capitol 
Corridor.
    Will you commit to awarding California projects their fair share of 
funding from the Federal-State Partnership Intercity Passenger Rail 
Program, based on our population and the State's contribution in tax 
dollars?
    Answer. The Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail 
(FSP) Program provides a generational Federal funding opportunity to 
improve American passenger rail assets to expand or establish new 
intercity passenger rail service across the United States. Funding 
under the FSP-National Program is awarded on a competitive basis. 
Applications submitted under the FY 2022-23 FSP-National Notice of 
Funding Opportunity (NOFO) are currently undergoing review. Once 
applications are submitted, FRA evaluates projects based on their 
technical merit and project benefits as outlined in the NOFO. 
Additionally, FRA will take into account a project's ability to meet 
the Administration's goals of enhancing safety, addressing equitable 
economic growth and job creation, equity and barriers to opportunity, 
addressing climate change and sustainability, and transforming our 
Nation's infrastructure. These steps are taken to ensure the Nation's 
tax dollars are awarded to the most impactful projects across the 
Nation. FRA looks forward to reviewing and evaluating all eligible 
projects, including those located in California.
    Question. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure has 
been known to increase incidence of some kinds of cancer, reproductive 
and developmental harms, and immune harms. Congress required the 
Department of Defense to stop using PFAS-based firefighting foams by 
October 2024, and the Federal Aviation Administration requires U.S. 
civilian airports to meet the military's standards.
    How do you plan to help airports transition away from using toxic 
PFAS- based firefighting foams at civilian airports?
    Answer. The DOT shares your concerns and developed a transition 
plan for airports to use in their transition to the new fluorine-free 
foam (F3). The FAA has met with the Department of Defense, the 
Environmental Protection Agency, and our industry stakeholders, 
including aircraft firefighters, to develop the plan. On May 8, 2023, 
the FAA published the Aircraft Firefighting Foam Transition Plan, 
meeting the congressional mandate to develop this plan. The Plan is 
available on the FAA website at https://www.faa.gov/airports/
airport_safety/aircraft_rescue_fire_fighting/f3_transi tion. We will 
continue to prioritize this transition in order to maintain the safest 
air transportation system in the world while also addressing 
environmental concerns.

               Questions Submitted by Senator Joe Manchin
               
    Question. On February 27th, the Wall Street Journal reported that 
every former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator 
spanning the Clinton Administration through the Trump Administration 
wrote to you expressing public safety concerns over automakers like 
Ford and Tesla taking AM radios out of their electric vehicle models. 
AM radio is the backbone of the National Public Warning System. Because 
of its reach and resiliency in the worst conditions, FEMA has invested 
heavily in infrastructure to ensure these stations remain on air, even 
in the event of an EMP attack or other disaster. In fact, AM radio 
listening spikes during disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes. While 
some automakers claim they are taking AM radios out of their electric 
vehicle models because of interference to the AM signal generated by 
electric motors, others like General Motors and Toyota have shown the 
issue is easily resolvable and worked around.
    Mr. Secretary, have you had any engagement with automakers related 
to these public safety concerns?
    Answer. The DOT recognizes the important role that AM radio has 
played and continues to play in providing people the information they 
need for safety, including information about weather emergencies. The 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is delegated 
authority under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act to 
protect the public against unreasonable risk of crashes due to the 
design, construction, or performance of a motor vehicle, and against 
unreasonable risk of death or injury in a crash. We understand there is 
legislation in Congress that would give NHTSA authority to require 
automakers to equip motor vehicles with AM radios as standard 
equipment. We look forward to closely reviewing the legislation and 
working with Congress on this issue.
    To better understand the issue, we have initiated dialogue with the 
auto industry and with related industries on this important topic and 
we are happy to keep you posted on those activities.
    Question. Mr. Secretary, as you know, PFAS are a large family of 
fluorinated chemicals, exposure to which is associated with increased 
risk of cancer, harm to fetal development, and other serious health 
problems. In the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress 
required the Department of Defense to stop using PFAS-based 
firefighting foams entirely by October 1, 2024. Because the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) requires U.S. civilian airports to meet 
the military's standards, funding will be needed to safely flush and 
clean fire suppression systems and tanks holding old firefighting foam 
stocks to facilitate this transition to PFAS-free foams.
    How can the FAA use Airport Improvement Grants to help transition 
civilian airports to firefighting foams without toxic PFAS chemicals?
    Answer. Airport Improvement Program grants can pay for costs that 
are eligible by statute and justified, such as replacing Aircraft 
Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) vehicles that are incompatible with 
PFAS-free firefighting foam. The FAA is collaborating with our industry 
and government partners to better understand how to successfully 
eliminate reliance upon chemicals containing PFAS. In addition, the FAA 
has met with the Department of Defense, the Environmental Protection 
Agency and our industry stakeholders, including aircraft firefighters, 
to develop a transition plan to the new fluorine-free foam (F3). On May 
8, 2023, the FAA published the Aircraft Firefighting Foam Transition 
Plan, meeting the congressional mandate to develop this plan. The Plan 
is available on the FAA website at https://www.faa.gov/airports/
airport_safety/aircraft_rescue_fire_fighting/f3_transi tion.
    Question. Corridor H was first designated by President Johnson as 
part of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) in 1965 to 
connect I-81 in Virginia to I-79 in West Virginia, and over 55 years 
later, we're still working on it. There's a reason we still care. 
Connecting the population base of the DC metro area to the interior of 
West Virginia would be a game changer, and we've already seen huge 
economic benefits along the sections that have already been completed. 
When I was Governor, I was proud of open up more than half of Corridor 
H. And I have been proud to secure Federal funding through 
Appropriations over the past 3 years, and to include my Finish the ADHS 
Act in the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Around 
90% of Corridor H has been funded or completed. That leaves just 15 
miles left in West Virginia. That's it. And the longer we wait to do 
this, the more expensive it's going to be. It's long past time we 
finish the job.
    Mr. Secretary, I appreciate our past conversations and your 
attention to finishing Corridor H. Will you commit to working with us 
to finish this once and for all?
    Answer. Yes, I commit to working with you, State stakeholders, and 
the Appalachian Regional Commission to complete the corridor in 
accordance with the law as expeditiously as possible.
    Question. During my time in the Senate, I've fought to keep ticket 
agents in West Virginia, save the New River Train, and expand rail 
service that keeps my state connected to the rest of the Nation. We 
have two Amtrak lines that stop in West Virginia, the Capitol Limited, 
which runs through our Eastern Panhandle, and the Cardinal, which runs 
from New York City to Chicago and traverses much of the southern 
portion of the State--from the Summit Bechtel National Scout Reserve, 
the State Capitol in Charleston, to Marshall University in Huntington. 
The Cardinal line is also notable as the only train with an Amtrak stop 
inside of a National Park--the New River Gorge National Park and 
Preserve--in the entire United States. Unfortunately, it is also one of 
two lines in the entire country that only runs 3 days per week. We've 
all talked about making sure to restore service across the Nation after 
the pandemic. Any form of transportation needs reliable service or 
people will stop using it, and it makes no sense to me that West 
Virginia shouldn't have the same consistent service as the rest of the 
country. That's why I'm proud to say that I am working with the Federal 
Railroad Administration (FRA) to evaluate ways to restore daily service 
on the Cardinal.
    Can I count on you and your team to work with my staff and 
stakeholders in West Virginia to look at ways to restore 7 day a week 
service on this critical transportation route to my state?
    Answer. Section 22214 of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law directs 
FRA to conduct a study to evaluate the restoration of daily passenger 
service along discontinued Amtrak long-distance routes, as well as 
``any Amtrak long-distance routes that, as of the date of the enactment 
of this act, occur on a non-daily basis.'' As of the enactment of the 
act, two Amtrak long-distance routes provided (and continue to provide) 
service three days per week: the Cardinal, which operates between New 
York and Chicago via West Virginia, and the Sunset Limited, which 
operates between New Orleans and Los Angeles. As part of the study, FRA 
is evaluating restoring daily service to both the Cardinal and Sunset 
Limited, including potential costs associated with daily service. FRA 
is engaging with State DOTs, Amtrak, Class I Railroads, metropolitan 
planning organizations, regional passenger rail authorities, local 
officials, federally recognized Tribes, and the broader stakeholder 
community as we evaluate how to better connect people with long-
distance rail services. Materials from the study's regional working 
group meetings are available on the study website at https://
fralongdistancerailstudy.org/. Representatives from the West Virginia 
DOT, West Virginia Regional Intergovernmental Council, and KYOVA 
Interstate Planning Commission (West Virginia, Kentucky & Ohio) have 
participated in working group sessions to date. The FRA looks forward 
to further engagement with stakeholders across the country--including 
those from West Virginia--as the study progresses.

            Questions Submitted by Senator Chris Van Hollen
            
    Question. Washington Union Station is the second busiest train 
station in the country. The station anchors the southern end of the 
Northeast Corridor, is the centerpiece of potential regional run-
through commuter rail service between Maryland and Virginia, and serves 
as a gateway for domestic and international travelers visiting the 
Nation's capital. Despite the vital role the station plays, much of 
Union Station's rail infrastructure and passenger facilities have been 
left largely untouched or decreased in size since the building was 
originally constructed in 1907. With station ridership expected to 
double between 2000 and 2040, the station is quickly being pushed 
beyond capacity. Due to the absence of much-needed improvements and 
renovations, the station's safety, security, and accessibility 
deficiencies threaten future operations. As you know, the Union Station 
Redevelopment Corporation and Amtrak have developed a plan for the 
Washington Union Station Expansion Project (SEP) to address these 
challenges and expand Union Station to serve the region and nation's 
next century. Whereas nearly all other multimodal transportation 
facilities are owned by State or municipal transportation entities, 
Union Station is federally-owned by DOT--making this a truly unique 
asset. The Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure that Union 
Station is maintained and expanded to meet the needs of the public. 
Congress stands ready to assist the Administration as necessary to 
implement this project, but DOT must play a vital role during this 
formative period.
    Do you agree that completion of the SEP is of significant 
importance to both regional and national interests and that DOT--as the 
owner of Washington Union Station--needs to play a more active role in 
ensuring this project moves forward without additional delays?
    Answer. The SEP is of critical interest to DOT and FRA. Therefore, 
DOT and FRA continue to play an active role in moving this project 
forward:

  --Recently, the FRA identified the Union Station Redevelopment 
        Corporation (USRC) as the Project Sponsor. As such, USRC will 
        oversee the planning, design, and construction of the SEP. 
        Prior to coming to Washington, USRC's new CEO led the execution 
        and delivery of the Moynihan Train Hall expansion to Penn 
        Station, a project of similar scale and complexity.

  --The FRA released the Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact 
        Statement (EIS) for the SEP on May 12, 2023, and plans to issue 
        the Final EIS/Record of Decision in January 2024, per the 
        schedule published on the Federal Permitting Dashboard.

  --The SEP is listed on FRA's Northeast Corridor Project Inventory as 
        a project in pre-construction and was eligible to apply for 
        funding through the Federal State Partnership for Intercity 
        Passenger Rail--Northeast Corridor Program for pre- 
        construction activities.
    Question. As the owner of Washington Union Station, what steps can 
DOT take now, in advance of the EIS completion to position this 
essential project for execution?
    Answer. The FY 2024 President's Budget proposes to set aside $15 
million from the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail 
program for a directed grant to the Union Station Redevelopment 
Corporation to advance critical state of good repair and rehabilitation 
projects at the station. Currently FRA is funding and overseeing 
several near-term foundational projects that set the stage for the SEP. 
These include the Track 22 Rehabilitation Project, the Washington Union 
Station Subbasement Structural Replacement Program and Subbasement 
Utility Relocation Project, and the Concourse Modernization Project.
    The FRA is also involved in several activities that are essential 
to project execution:

  --The Office of the Secretary (OST) and FRA are on the Advisory Group 
        for the District of Columbia (District) commissioned study on 
        the delivery and governance of the SEP. The District will 
        complete the Study by the end of 2023 and it will recommend a 
        project delivery approach including the governance structure, 
        and the financial, legal, and legislative roadmap to implement 
        the SEP.

  --The FRA is working with Amtrak to coordinate with and obtain 
        agreement from the other rail operators regarding the SEP 
        terminal infrastructure construction phasing and track outages.

  --The FRA is consulting with the U.S. General Services Administration 
        to understand requirements/best practices for disposal of 
        Federal property and acquisition of property for Federal 
        development, including air rights.

  --The FRA, USRC, and Amtrak will submit the SEP to the National 
        Capital Planning Commission for Preliminary Review approval and 
        to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts for Concept Review approval 
        prior to the end of calendar year 2023.
    Question. Would you support the Department's development of an 
action plan to clarify and establish what organizational entity will 
oversee the planning, design, and construction of the SEP?
    Answer. The DOT agrees that a governance and execution action plan 
will be vital in ensuring the successful execution and completion of 
the SEP. The FRA recently identified the USRC as the Project Sponsor. 
Additionally, FRA is an active participant in the District of Columbia 
commissioned delivery and governance study.

            Questions Submitted by Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith
            
                         essential air service
                         
    Question. There are 4 Essential Air Service (EAS) communities in 
Mississippi. We want to ensure funding for the EAS program. 
Additionally, it is important that airlines exist to serve EAS 
communities, especially in light of the pilot shortage. At least one 
new entrant is SkyWest Charter who hopes to serve many EAS communities, 
but their application for commuter authority appears to be held up.
    Will DOT please act quickly to approve the SkyWest Charter 
application so communities in Mississippi and other States across the 
US may continue EAS service?
    Answer. The DOT has been hearing from many communities awaiting a 
decision on SkyWest Charter's application and appreciates how important 
this is for the communities. The DOT is actively reviewing SkyWest 
Charter's application and providing full and fair consideration to the 
pleadings filed in the public docket. As this matter is contested, DOT 
is unable to comment on the merits of the application. Regarding the 
EAS communities in Mississippi, DOT continues to hold in SkyWest 
Airlines at Hattiesburg/Laurel and Meridian, on 30-day periods, and 
will hold in SkyWest Airlines until a replacement carrier is located. 
For Greenville and Tupelo, which currently have Alternate EAS grants, 
Corporate Flight Management, Inc. d/b/a Contour Airlines is their 
selected air carrier.
    Outside of EAS, DOT has invested heavily in improving Mississippi's 
airports. Since 2019, the FAA has provided airports in MS over $148 
million in Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funding for eligible 
capital development and $71 million in COVID relief funds. In addition, 
airports around the state have received over $57.4 million in funding 
provided through programs established under the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law (BIL), which includes the BIL Airport Infrastructure 
Grant program; and the Airport Terminal Program (ATP) and FAA Contract 
Tower (FCT) competitive discretionary grant programs. The DOT has also 
awarded Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASDP) grants 
to Mississippi communities, including a $750,000 grant to the Golden 
Triangle Airport and a $750,000 grant to the Natchez-Adams County 
Airport to improve air service; both communities are actively working 
to recruit an air carrier.

                  airport improvement program funding
                  
    Question. Will FAA change its position on allowing AIP funds to be 
used for the maintenance, enhancement, and extension of secondary 
runways?
    Answer. AIP funds are eligible to maintain, enhance, and extend 
existing secondary runways when there is a demonstrated capacity need 
at the airport. Some airports have lost either the frequency of 
operations or service, or both, that originally justified secondary 
runways. When aircraft operations have declined over a sustained period 
of time, it is difficult to justify AIP funding to maintain existing 
secondary runways (or at least to their full existing dimensions) given 
other priority infrastructure needs around the airport system. In 
addition, the Federal Government has made a significant investment in 
developing all-weather runway infrastructure, and well-established 
regional systems of airports that can provide support during irregular 
operations. However, the FAA does consider exceptions unrelated to 
capacity based on unique operational circumstances of the airport and 
its users. Examples include the need to efficiently separate faster jet 
aircraft from slower propeller aircraft, efficiency and operational 
resiliency for certain demanding air medical transport and aircraft 
firefighting (e.g., wildfire) operations, inclusion in a noise 
abatement preferential runway use program, and significant facility 
investment (hangars or maintenance, repair, and oversight facilities 
(MROs) that are located to use the secondary runway.

                      chinese manufactured drones
                      
    Question. I understand that the FAA still uses drones made by 
Chinese companies in its work, and may permit third party contractors 
to fly DJI drones to inspect the FAA's national infrastructure. Will 
the Department commit to reviewing this matter and ensuring that 
Federal taxpayer dollars are not used to fund the operation of 
technology that places our security at risk?
    Answer. The FAA utilizes the GSA Blue Unmanned Aircraft Systems 
(UAS) approved system list as a default for appropriate UAS systems to 
acquire for operational purposes. The existing policy was implemented 
following the issuance of Executive Order 13981, Protecting the United 
States from Certain Unmanned Aircraft Systems. The intent to curtail 
the acquisition of ``covered systems'' of foreign-manufactured drones 
was implemented in a policy that the FAA will not acquire any ``covered 
systems,'' either directly or through a contractor, for the operations 
of the FAA.
    However, understanding that foreign-manufactured drones make up the 
majority of the entire UAS marketplace, it is crucial to ensure that 
the highest fidelity research possible is performed to adequately 
address the safety of the National Airspace System (NAS). Therefore, to 
meet the FAA's statutory and regulatory requirements regarding the 
safety of the NAS, the FAA needs to conduct research, utilizing 
foreign-manufactured drones and domestically-manufactured drones, to 
compile the data necessary to inform UAS data-driven policy decisions, 
safety assessments, procedures, rulemaking, and standards to enable the 
agency to integrate emerging entrants safely and securely. The FAA does 
individualized cybersecurity planning to implement the safeguards 
necessary to properly protect the integrity of FAA and U.S. Government 
systems from foreign-manufactured drones.
    Question. Do you agree that DOT should ensure Federal grant funding 
is not being used on drones manufactured by companies that pose a 
threat to national security?
    Answer. Yes. In the context of research and development, the FAA 
conducts a significant body of research through its FAA Center of 
Excellence (COE) for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) (also known as 
ASSURE) using grant funding to inform UAS data-driven policy decisions, 
safety assessments, procedures, rulemaking, and standards to enable the 
agency to integrate emerging entrants safely and securely. This 
research evaluates safety risks and requires consideration and 
evaluation of the characteristics of drones most commonly flying in the 
U.S. today. Foreign-manufactured drones make up the majority of the 
marketplace, so it is crucial to ensure that the highest fidelity 
research possible is performed to adequately address the safety of the 
NAS.
    The use of Federal grant money should be scrutinized and only 
approved for narrowly focused research efforts that expand the FAA's 
knowledge and understanding of the safety and security risks posed by 
foreign manufactured drones. Every day, manufacturers are modifying and 
evolving their technologies with different modalities, protocols, and 
capabilities that can only be understood through tailored research 
efforts that look at these systems and assess their impact to public 
safety, the airport environment, and to the National airspace.
    Question. What process does the Department have in place to vet 
incoming Federal grant applications for connections to Chinese military 
companies?
    Answer. The FAA Center of Excellence (COE) for Unmanned Aircraft 
Systems (UAS) is required to certify that they have reviewed the latest 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) industry alert on drone use if it 
is determined drones will be utilized in research grants. They must 
further assess and certify the risks within their proposals, which are 
then reviewed by the FAA.
    FAA's Airport Improvement Program and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
grant programs can only accept grant applications from recognized 
airport sponsors, pursuant to Federal law. The grant recipients, in 
turn, are required to comply with Federal procurement regulations, 
including Build America, Buy America Act requirements (Pub. L. 117-58, 
div. G, title IX, subtitle A), and other requirements under Sec. 889 of 
the National Defense Authorization Act of 2019 (Pub. L. 115- 232) on 
restrictions related to Chinese manufacturers.

                               gps backup
                               
    Question. Federal policy requires DOT to identify and respond to 
GPS interference incidents, improve resilience to GPS interference, and 
ensure transportation safety. Unfortunately, very little progress has 
been made in this space over the last few years. In fact, we are still 
awaiting the Administration's guidance on EO 13905, which is 
specifically calls on DOT, and others, to strengthen our Nation's PNT 
resiliency.
    When should Congress expect to see the release of the 
Administration's guidance on Executive Order 13905?
    Answer. The National Space-Based PNT Executive Committee (EXCOM) 
Departments and Agencies are working to implement EO 13905, including 
activities related to GPS and Complementary PNT systems, but are not 
currently working on issuing guidance with respect to EO 13905. EO 
13905 and SPD-7 form a policy ecosystem that encompasses all forms of 
PNT technology. The National Security Council (NSC) has also provided 
oversight of Executive Branch activities regarding execution of EO 
13905 responsibilities, including implementation activities the Sector 
Risk Management Agencies (SRMAs) are working on with individual 
critical infrastructure sectors designed to promote the responsible use 
of PNT by owners and operators of PNT.
    Section 4 of Executive Order (EO) 13905 identifies several 
implementation activities designed to promote the responsible use of 
PNT by owners and operators of PNT; DOT has been conducting a number of 
related initiatives in support of Strengthening National Resilience 
Through Responsible Use of PNT Services for the Transportation Systems 
Sector (TSS). These initiatives are enumerated below:

    1) PNT Profile Adaptation (EO 13905, Section 4(a) and Vulnerability 
Assessment and Testing (EO 13905, Section 4(c))

    DOT has been conducting PNT vulnerability assessments and testing 
focused on aviation, maritime, rail, as well as connected and automated 
vehicle applications that apply the NIST PNT Profile (NISTIR 8323) five 
core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover. These 
functions provide a high-level, strategic view of the life cycle of an 
organization's management of PNT cybersecurity risk.

    2) Federal Radionavigation Plan (FRP) (EO 13905, Section 4(b))

    DOT, DHS, and the Department of Defense (DOD) incorporated 
references to EO 13905, and specifically to the NIST PNT profile, into 
updated Sections 3.2.10, 3.2.11, and 6.5 of the 2021 Federal 
Radionavigation Plan signed by the Secretaries of Homeland Security, 
Transportation, and Defense released on July 1, 2022.

    3) PNT Contractual Language (EO 13905, Section 4(d))

    DOT participates in the DHS-led working group to develop and 
evaluate PNT resilience contract language through table-top exercises 
with contract and acquisition professionals. The projected timeline is 
as follows:

  --August/September 2023: Complete working draft of PNT Contract 
        Language Guidelines. Interagency review will be coordinated by 
        the National Coordination Office (NCO) for Space-Based 
        Positioning, Navigation, and Timing.

  --September 30, 2023: Final DHS/Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
        Security Agency (CISA)-approved PNT model contract language 
        ready for Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Council 
        submission and concurrent Guidelines/Best Practices release on 
        the DHS/CISA website. FAR Council Case standard timeline is 
        approximately 16 months from submission.

    4) DOT Maritime Pilot Program (EO 13905, Section 4(g))

    DOT focused its pilot program on GPS jamming and spoofing in the 
maritime environment through a partnership between OST-R and MARAD. 
MARAD maintains over 40 U.S. Government-owned ships as part of the 
Ready Reserve Force (RRF) fleet that supports national security 
operations around the globe. This Pilot Program identified specific 
shipboard systems aboard MARAD's RRF vessels that use or form PNT data, 
identified a Complementary PNT data source suitable for the maritime 
operating environment to diversify acquisition of PNT service data from 
a non-GPS source, detected the disruption and manipulation of PNT 
services in actual and simulated marine environments; and provided 
MARAD with a framework to manage the associated risks to the shipboard 
systems, networks, and assets dependent on PNT services. These findings 
led to recommendations for candidate technologies that could help 
mitigate the effects of GPS signal disruption sources and will inform 
future PNT acquisition decisions for RRF vessels.

    5) DOT Implementation Activities in Support of the National 
Research and Development Plan for PNT Resilience (EO 13905, Section 
4(h))

    The R&D Plan for PNT Resilience issued by the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy (OSTP) in August 2021 prioritizes 14 objectives which 
are focused on achieving greater PNT service resilience. DOT selected 
to participate in 13 of the 14 research objectives.

                    gao report re: gps interference
                    
    Question. All transportation modes use and rely on accurate and 
reliable GPS information for PNT purposes. This information is critical 
to public safety and the efficient management of U.S. transportation 
systems. However, it is also a represents a severe vulnerability to 
U.S. travelers and our Nation's macroeconomic wellbeing. Until the 
recent NOTAM disruption, GPS was perhaps the most significant ``single 
point of failure'' concern in our transportation ecosystem.
    According to a December 2022 GAO report about GPS disruptions and 
resiliency, ``DOT identified 196 potential GPS interference incidents 
from January 2020 through May 2022. However, GAO found that DOT's 
process does not include all available user reports, and DOT's data 
contain inaccurate information.''
    Is the Department partnering with the private sector to identify 
PNT resiliency solutions that eliminate this single-point-of-failure 
while minimizing taxpayer exposure?
    Answer. The DOT is developing guidance to document standard 
processes to record GPS interference incidents across all 
transportation modes and to ensure quality assurance oversight. The DOT 
also has entered into an Interagency Agreement with the DOD Defense 
Innovation Unit to accelerate the implementation of an automated GPS 
interference detection capability leveraging the use of commercial data 
from GPS receivers across space, aviation, maritime, and surface 
domains. This capability will provide the U.S. Government and the 
public with a common operating picture of GPS interference events.
    In addition, DOT is developing a detailed Complementary PNT (CPNT) 
Action Plan to drive adoption of resilient PNT solutions based on 
commercial PNT technologies across the Nation's transportation system 
and within other critical infrastructure sectors. The plan involves 
engaging PNT technology vendors and critical infrastructure owners and 
operators, supporting the development of CPNT specifications and 
standards, conducting CPNT testing and evaluation, and creating a 
Federal PNT Services Clearinghouse. Taken together with the efforts of 
other Federal partners, these initiatives will continue to strengthen 
the resilience of the Nation's PNT-dependent systems by encouraging and 
promoting the responsible use of PNT by owners and operators of 
critical infrastructure, resulting in safer and more secure critical 
infrastructure.

                           cybersecurity--pnt
                           
    Question. There are areas that I do want to commend the Department 
for its action to ensure cybersecurity and all-hazards resilience, 
including Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), are part of the 
standard Notices of Funding Opportunities language that the Department 
issues for the discretionary programs. I am, however, concerned that 
recipients, such as the State DOTs, are not fully aware of the certain 
eligibilities like PNT.
    What efforts are being undertaken by the Department to ensure it is 
fully communicated to applicants given the critical importance of PNT?
    Answer. The DOT has taken an aggressive and considered approach to 
informing potential applicants, both new entrants and repeat grantees, 
of the many opportunities afforded them by the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law (BIL) and other grants, including cybersecurity and 
all-hazards resilience. The DOT launched and continues to improve the 
DOT Navigator, a resource to help communities understand the best ways 
to apply for grants, and to plan for and deliver transformative 
infrastructure projects and services. The DOT Navigator (https://
www.transportation.gov/grants/dot-navigator/about-dot-navigator) 
provides general information to develop grant applications and 
understand frequently required documents, contacts to DOT regional and 
field offices, and a searchable menu of technical assistance resources 
available to help new and repeat grantees to realize their communities' 
visions for moving goods and people safely, efficiently, sustainable, 
and equitably. The DOT routinely delivers new toolkits and holds 
webinars on these grant opportunities, and sponsors outreach to 
specific communities, such as the Rural Opportunities to Use 
Transportation for Economic Success (ROUTES) initiative.
    Examples of the success of this technical assistance concerning PNT 
and cybersecurity include the February 2023 selection of two grantees 
in the BIL University Transportation Center (UTC) Program:

  --Center for Assured and Resilient Navigation in Advanced 
        Transportation Systems at the Illinois Institute of Technology, 
        and

  --Center for Automated Vehicle Research with Multimodal Assured 
        Navigation at The Ohio State University.

    In the Strengthening Mobility and Revolutionizing Transportation 
(SMART) Grants program, March 2023 selections included:

  --Regional Planning Commission of Greater Birmingham, to convert 
        existing public transportation systems in Central Alabama into 
        an integrated mobility system leveraging cyberinfrastructure, 
        route optimization and planning, service integration, trip 
        dispatching, and more.

  --North Carolina Department of Transportation, to provide hands free, 
        eyes free alerts to motorists through existing smartphone 
        applications and navigation systems in North Carolina.
        
                       roadway safety technology
                       
    Question. Approximately 43,000 people died in motor vehicle traffic 
crashes in 2021. This represents the highest number of fatalities since 
2005 and the largest annual percentage increase ever recorded. This is 
both tragic and unacceptable. Many roadway deaths are avoidable thanks 
to advancements in roadway safety technologies, such as Cellular 
Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V-2-X), among other technologies that enables 
vehicles to communicate with other vehicles, with the infrastructure 
they are driving on, and with nearby. In fact, NHTSA estimates safety 
applications enabled by V2X could eliminate or mitigate the severity of 
more than 80 percent of vehicle crashes.
    There is significant desire in both the public and private sector 
to deploy C-V2X. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently 
received waiver requests from more than 10 State DOTs, three major 
automakers, and nearly 20 technology companies and equipment 
manufacturers interested in deploying C-V2X. Now is the time to deploy 
C-V2X throughout our transportation system.
    What is the Department doing to promote rapid and widespread 
deployment of C-V2X and will you commit to provide the leadership 
necessary to ensure the Nation will realize the overwhelming safety 
benefits of C-V2X?
    Answer. The DOT is strongly committed to advancing deployment of C-
V2X capabilities to reduce roadway crashes and fatalities.
    The DOT is working on a number of paths to promote rapid and 
widespread deployment of C-V2X:

  --The DOT has held two Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) 
        stakeholder community Summits (stakeholder engagement sessions) 
        to identify ongoing needs so that DOT can help overcome gaps 
        and challenges to allow stakeholders to move forward 
        successfully with their deployments. The DOT has been:

    --Partnering with National Telecommunications and Information 
            Administration (NTIA) on test-based analyses that support 
            Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ability to grant 
            the pending waivers.

    --Developing technical guidance and assistance to support V2X field 
            deployments.

    --Working with industry on V2X standards and implementation 
            processes.

  --During the first V2X Communications Summit in August 2022, the 
        stakeholder community requested that DOT partner with FCC and 
        NTIA to resolve issues remaining with the FCC decision that 
        would allow the FCC to grant waivers to permit deployment of C-
        V2X technology; and that DOT coordinate the development of a 
        nationally scalable and interoperable Deployment Plan.

    --On April 24, 2023, the FCC granted a joint waiver request that 
            allows automakers like Ford, Jaguar Land Rover, and Audi, 
            State departments of transportation in Utah and Virginia, 
            and private companies to deploy cellular Vehicle to 
            Everything (C-V2X) technology in the 5.9 GHz band.

    --Since August 2022, the DOT team has collected needs statements 
            and ideas for how to create a Deployment Plan that can be 
            executed by and with State and local deployers and 
            automotive manufacturers (including after-market 
            installations as well as fully equipped vehicles).

    --Working with the stakeholder trade associations-AASHTO, ITE, ITS 
            America, ATSSA, Auto Innovators, and 5GAA-the DOT team held 
            ``mini dialogues'' with association members as well as 
            individual State and local departments of transportation, 
            to gather input on vision, mission, goals, and strategies 
            for the Plan.

    --On April 28, 2023, DOT held the second Summit on Enhancing 
            Interoperable Connectivity for Safe Transportation to 
            collaboratively work on developing the Deployment Plan.
            
        gao report on aviation safety bi-laterals and validation
        
    Question. For many years, the Committee focused on FAA efforts to 
improve the aviation safety bi-lateral agreements and maintain fairness 
for U.S. companies in the international marketplace. The GAO has an 
ongoing review of the resources and activities related to FAA's 
efforts, which may inform decisions into this Committee's oversight of 
these activities moving forward, particularly given the implications 
for U.S. manufacturers.
    When this GAO report is complete, will you commit to a discussion 
with this committee on its findings?
    Answer. FAA leadership in the global aviation community is 
essential not only for the benefit of U.S. travelers flying abroad, but 
also for the U.S. and international aerospace industry. The FAA values 
GAO's work and respects the findings of its review. The FAA would be 
happy to discuss the findings in the GAO report with the Committee.

                           aircraft emissions
                           
    Question. In 2016, under the leadership of the United States, the 
International Civil Aviation Organization completed its first ever Fuel 
Efficiency Standards with the goal to limit aircraft CO2 emissions. The 
standards were agreed to by more than 190 countries. The U.S. is in the 
process of implementing these standards through an FAA rule-making 
initiated in June 2022. Once adopted, all U.S. aircraft will have to be 
certified to these new standards in order to be delivered to their 
customers after 2027. The European Union adopted its implementation 
rule in 2019, and completed its first certification of an aircraft in 
2020. U.S. manufacturers of large and small aircraft are anxious to 
have a final FAA rule released as soon as possible in order to begin 
certifying aircraft to the standard. However, that rule will need to be 
completed before our domestic manufacturers will be able to apply for 
those certifications
    Can you please tell the Committee when you expect the rule to be 
finalized?
    Answer. On January 11, 2021, EPA published a final rule adopting 
the ICAO standard into U.S. regulations as a new part in title 40 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) (40 CFR Part 1030). On June 15, 
2022, in accordance with requirements under the Clean Air Act for the 
FAA to enforce the standard at the time of aircraft certification, the 
FAA proposed new certification regulations for certain airplanes to 
ensure compliance with EPA standards. The applicability of the proposed 
regulations and the regulatory emissions limits in the United States 
are the same as those adopted by ICAO as its airplane CO2 emissions 
standard. The comment period for FAA's proposal closed on August 15, 
2022, and the FAA received sixty-two comments on the rule. The FAA is 
currently working on a final rule, which the FAA anticipates will 
publish in September 2023.

            Questions Submitted by Senator Susan M. Collins
            
                       faa family seating policy
                       
    Question. The Department is proposing legislation that would 
require airlines to seat children with an accompanying adult. Like 
many, I believe young children should be able to sit next to a parent 
or guardian when flying, without having to pay an additional fee. I 
want to make sure all customers have the same experience regardless of 
the airline they choose to fly. However, there seems to be a much 
higher burden placed on airlines that do not assign seats versus those 
that do.
    I commend the Department's efforts to get several carriers to agree 
to the Department's new family seating commitment, which is reflected 
in DOT's new dashboard, as well as the legislation you are asking 
Congress to adopt. Unfortunately, it appears the reason why some 
carriers were willing to change their policies is because DOT only 
wants carriers that assign seats to agree to provide adjacent seating 
for families only when such seats are available at the time of booking. 
This is unlike DOT's expectation of carriers that do not assign seats, 
or have an open seating model, in which case DOT is requiring adjacent 
seating at the time of boarding. There is a big difference to require 
adjacent seating when seats are available at the time consumers 
purchase their tickets versus during the boarding process.
    I want to learn more about the data the Department used to justify 
its proposal. Is it from the number of complaints, or were there other 
data points used?
    Answer. In July 2022, DOT issued a notice urging airlines to do 
everything that they can to ensure the ability of a young child to be 
seated next to an accompanying adult family member or other 
accompanying adult, without charging fees for adjacent seating. The 
DOT's review of airline seating policies revealed that airlines' 
seating policies and practices do not ensure that a child is able to be 
seated next to an accompanying adult family member. The DOT also 
reviewed family seating complaints that it received against airlines. 
While the number of complaints DOT receives from air travelers about 
family seating is low compared to other categories of complaints 
against airlines, the impact of a single incident can be significant 
for the affected family.
    The following are only some examples of complaints involving family 
seating issues which DOT received prior to sending the proposed 
legislation. The examples involve a variety of major U.S. airlines.
  --A family with a 3-year-old did not pay more for advance seating. 
        Each member of the family, including the 3-year-old, received a 
        middle seat assignment before flight. The family arrived at the 
        airport early for assistance with seating the 3-year old with 
        an adult only to receive no help from the staff or flight 
        attendants. Parents had to ``bargain'' with passengers on board 
        for volunteers to move. The airline's response did not dispute 
        the occurrence.

    On the same airline, another complaint said that a 2-year old was 
given a middle seat next to strangers and it was only through the 
goodwill of a passenger willing to accept a middle seat that the child 
sat with a parent. The complaint asserts that airline employees did not 
assist and only ``chided'' them for not paying to get seats together. 
The airline's response did not dispute the occurrence.

  --A nine-year-old did not sit next to his parent because when they 
        boarded the aircraft other passengers who boarded earlier were 
        saving seats and no passenger would move. The airline's 
        response did not dispute the occurrence and stated that it does 
        not have a specific policy that prevents customers from saving 
        seats and it cannot guarantee customers will be able to find 
        seats together on the aircraft. Another complaint about the 
        airline asserted that the airline asked the parent to pay a 
        premium boarding fee to guarantee that 10- year-old twins could 
        sit with their parents because its family boarding was only for 
        kids 6 and under. In its response, the airline said that it 
        offers upgraded boarding as a voluntary purchase for a prime 
        boarding position, but still doesn't guarantee a specific seat 
        onboard.

  --A customer called the airline in advance of flight to ask if the 
        airline can seat a 2-year old with a parent. The carrier said 
        the party would have to wait until they get to the airport, but 
        it was possible that the 2-year-old would sit with two random 
        strangers. In its response, the airline apologized that the 
        consumer was unaware of the restrictions on basic economy fares 
        which do not have advanced seat assignments. After the 
        passenger complained to DOT, the airline said it gave a one-
        time exception to the policy.

    Whether an airline assigns seats or an airline has an open seating 
model, DOT believes a parent who purchases airline tickets for a family 
should receive a guarantee from the airline that it will seat the 
parent and child together without fees or a last-minute scramble at the 
gate or on the aircraft.
    For airlines that assign seats, under DOT's proposed legislation, 
these airlines would be required to ensure each young child is seated 
adjacent to an accompanying adult to the extent adjacent seats are or 
become available after the family is ticketed. The DOT included this 
exception in the proposed legislation to avoid airlines taking away a 
seat that is already assigned to another passenger.
    Because airlines that practice open seating do not assign seats, 
the proposed legislation does not include similar language for the open 
seating model. The DOT's proposal leaves it to the discretion of 
airlines that practice open seating to decide what policies and 
procedures work best to ensure children aged 13 and under receive seats 
next to an accompanying adult without the family needing to pay more 
for their trip for this purpose.
    Will the Department commit to providing the data you used to 
justify the Administration's proposal?
    Answer. The DOT stands ready to provide Members of Congress and 
congressional staff with additional information about its proposal that 
would fast track a ban on charges for family seating and require 
airlines to seat young children adjacent to an accompanying adult. As 
shown on DOT's Airline Family Seating Dashboard (https://
www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-family- seating-dashboard), 
three U.S. airlines that sell tickets have voluntarily made enforceable 
guarantees for fee-free family seating, but most have declined to make 
a guarantee to their customers.

                             vehicle safety 

    Question. Many localities use AM broadcasts to provide up to date 
local information. For example, the Maine Turnpike Authority uses 1610 
AM for emergency and non- emergency messages that are broadcast 24/7. 
These broadcasts can be issued for critical safety reasons, including 
accidents that close portions of the Turnpike or a major winter weather 
event. Recently, some electric vehicle manufacturers have eliminated AM 
radios from their cars noting that the electric motors interfere with 
the signal. This comes as the Administration is promoting the adoption 
of electric vehicles for personal, business, and official governmental 
purposes.
    Do you believe that the removal of AM radio from vehicles 
jeopardizes safety? If so, what steps is the Department of 
Transportation taking to ensure that motorists can continue to freely 
and safely receive local alerts without creating new burdens on 
localities?
    Answer. The DOT recognizes the important role that AM radio has 
played and continues to play with regard to people getting information 
that they need for safety, including information about weather 
emergencies. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) 
is delegated authority under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle 
Safety Act to protect the public against unreasonable risk of crashes 
due to the design, construction, or performance of a motor vehicle, and 
against unreasonable risk of death or injury in a crash. We understand 
there is legislation in Congress that would give NHTSA authority to 
require automakers to equip motor vehicles with AM radios as standard 
equipment. We look forward to closely reviewing the legislation and 
working with Congress on this issue.

          Questions Submitted by Senator Shelley Moore Capito
          
    Question. Turning to rail safety, you had stated initially that the 
previous Administration was to blame because they did not implement a 
rail braking regulation--known as electronically controlled pneumatic 
brakes or ECP brakes. Yesterday, the Commerce Committee had a hearing 
on the East Palestine derailment, and I asked Chair Homendy of the NTSB 
about this. She said that ECP brakes would not have prevented the 
derailment in East Palestine.
    Do you agree with the Chair or do you stand by your initial claim?
    Answer. I believe the Trump administration was wrong to cut 
railroad safety regulations, a view that I expressed in the immediate 
aftermath of the Norfolk Southern derailment and a view that I continue 
to hold.
    At the same time, I have gone out of my way not to assign blame for 
the Norfolk Southern derailment in East Palestine. I have consistently 
expressed my support for the NTSB's independent investigation, and I 
have expressed my agreement with Chair Homendy's concern that 
misinformation was spreading about the role of ECP brakes.
    In discussing the relevance of advanced braking systems, including 
the ECP braking rule withdrawn by the Trump administration in 2018, I 
have not asserted that it would have prevented this particular incident 
but rather have highlighted its relevance in the context of ensuring 
railroading becomes safer in America.
    DOT is committed to revisiting the potential for advanced braking 
systems, such as ECP brakes, throughout the industry to the extent it 
is shown to be feasible and beneficial. More generally, in this 
administration we will continue our work to strengthen, not weaken, 
railroad safety rules in America.

             Questions Submitted by Senator Lindsey Graham
             
    Question. It was recently reported in the Wall Street Journal and 
elsewhere that all of the former Administrators of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), spanning the previous four 
presidential administrations, joined in sending you a letter raising 
public safety concerns about some automakers removing AM tuners from 
new model cars, particularly electric vehicles. Former and current FEMA 
officials alike have noted publicly that AM stations due to their reach 
and resiliency are critical to the Nation's National Public Warning 
System, and removing AM reception from vehicles complicates emergency 
officials' ability to communicate with the public in times of need.
    Could you please provide a summary of any discussions you've had 
with automakers in response to this letter from the former heads of 
FEMA?
    Answer. The DOT recognizes the important role that AM radio has 
played and continues to play in providing people the information they 
need for safety, including information about weather emergencies. The 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is delegated 
authority under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act to 
protect the public against unreasonable risk of crashes due to the 
design, construction, or performance of a motor vehicle, and against 
unreasonable risk of death or injury in a crash. We understand there is 
legislation in Congress that would give NHTSA authority to require 
automakers to equip motor vehicles with AM radios as standard 
equipment. We look forward to closely reviewing the legislation and 
working with Congress on this issue.
    To better understand the issue, we have initiated dialogue with the 
auto industry and with related industries on this important topic and 
we are happy to keep you posted on those activities.

               Questions Submitted by Senator Jerry Moran
               
    Question. In 1988, the Department of Transportation's jurisdiction 
over mergers terminated, and the Department of Justice remains 
responsible for enforcing antitrust laws and evaluating proposed 
mergers.
    As such, can you explain the jurisdictional role, if any, the 
Department of Transportation has on any actions related to the proposed 
Spirit-JetBlue merger?
    Answer. The DOT considers a wide range of issues related to airline 
mergers that fall within its jurisdiction, including international 
route transfers, economic fitness, code-sharing, and possible unfair or 
deceptive practices and unfair methods of competition. Regarding the 
proposed merger of JetBlue and Spirit, the two carriers filed a 
transfer application requesting that the DOT allow them to combine and 
operate their international routes under one certificate (the 
authorization required to provide air transportation). The two carriers 
also filed an exemption application asking the DOT to permit them to 
operate under common ownership prior to the requested transfer. In 
light of the Department of Justice's pending antitrust litigation, the 
DOT denied the exemption application. The DOT continues to separately 
investigate the transfer as part of its statutory public interest 
mandate and under its authority to enforce against unfair and deceptive 
practices and unfair methods of competition.

              DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT

STATEMENT OF HON. MARCIA FUDGE, SECRETARY

               OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BRIAN SCHATZ

    Senator Schatz. Good morning. This hearing will come to 
order.
    Welcome. I am glad to be back with you, Ranking Member 
Hyde-Smith, as we evaluate the 2024 Budget Request for the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
    The committee's working aggressively to move forward under 
regular order. I look forward to getting a top line agreement 
in the next month allowing us to develop a balanced bipartisan 
bill that recognizes our country's serious housing challenges.
    Housing and homelessness are a top concern not only in 
major cities but also in rural areas, small towns, and most 
severely in tribal communities.
    At the same time HUD faces serious budgetary challenges. 
HUD offsetting receipts are down $7 billion from last year and 
at an all-time low due to loan volume, decreasing as a result 
of higher interest rates, and adding to the pressure the 
renewal of HUD rental assistance requires an increase of nearly 
$3 billion just to preserve existing units given rising market 
rate rents.
    The subcommittee has a long tradition of bipartisan 
cooperation on housing issues and the preservation of HUD 
rental and homeless assistance has always been the foundation 
of our bill, and we've made progress in key areas.
    The HUD VASH Program created by Chair Murray has cut 
veterans' homelessness by nearly 55 percent since 2009 and 
there are enough vouchers available to effectively end 
veterans' homelessness.
    The Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program created by 
Vice Chair Collins has reduced the number of homeless youth by 
25 percent since 2017, saving countless kids from trafficking 
or worse.
    Former Chairman Leahy established a Rapid Rehousing Program 
for survivors of domestic violence that has helped more than 
50,000 people get out of harm and into stability.
    Senators Reed and Collins made great strides to strengthen 
protections against lead poisoning, improving the health of 
thousands of children, and a core focus of mine has been to 
increase funding to historic levels for tribal communities 
where overcrowding is three times the national average and the 
poverty rate is double.
    But this progress will end if we enact the House Majority 
proposal to return to 2022 funding levels. Secretary Fudge has 
outlined her concerns in a response to Vice Chair DeLauro. I 
encourage my colleagues to review a copy of the letter on the 
dais.
    Senator Schatz. Now is not the time to slash housing 
programs. We should be building more housing, building it 
faster, and getting more families into the housing that they 
can afford.
    Amid these challenges, the Administration is proposing a 
number of initiatives to ease housing burdens. I'm especially 
pleased to see funding requests for the HOME Program to build 
more affordable housing and the Yes in My Backyard Affordable 
Housing Production Incentive Program. This program acknowledges 
that the Federal Government alone cannot build its way out of 
our housing crisis and that the government at multiple levels 
is responsible for creating a housing shortage.
    We need to create incentives for state and local 
governments to legalize housing. To the extent the Federal 
Government does support building, I similarly urge HUD to 
remove its own barriers to new housing by streamlining 
administrative procedures, improving coordination between 
Federal programs and reducing costs.
    My staff visited a new affordable housing development 
project in Colorado that used light-tech and four different 
funding streams from HUD for gap financing. That project had to 
go through five different property inspections for each funding 
stream, four of which were from HUD itself. This is a huge 
waste of time and resources. I'm glad I see the Secretary 
jotting this down, and something we can solve.
    To help families afford housing, we need to ensure public 
housing authorities are able to use the Section 8 vouchers that 
they already have and that's why I support the President's 
Budget Request to increase funding to administrative fees for 
PHAs so that they can pay for security deposits and holding 
fees that will get families into units faster.
    Finally, we should be doing more, not less, to combat 
homelessness. Last year we provided HUD $75 million for new 
permanent supportive housing. I was also pleased to work with 
the Secretary and Ranking Member Hyde-Smith over the last few 
months to make a historic $484 million available for 
unsheltered and rural homelessness.
    We know the Housing First approach works, but we can do 
more to connect housing and supportive services to get people 
off the streets and into stable housing.
    Secretary Fudge, thank you for appearing today. We look 
forward to discussing these and other issues that you are 
managing. I look forward to hearing your testimony, but first, 
Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, I turn to you for an opening 
statement.

                 STATEMENT OF SENATOR CINDY HYDE-SMITH

    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Chairman Schatz, and thank 
you, Madam Secretary, for being willing to serve and for 
stepping up. Thank you for being here today.
    Let me begin by thanking you for your visit to Mississippi 
following the deadly and disastrous tornados that hit us in 
March. We appreciate the assistance offered by HUD to help 
communities and families because my state will recover from 
that for a while, we're still in a desperate need, and I'm 
pleased to be here this morning to discuss the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development's fiscal year 2024 Budget 
Request.
    I want to say thank you to the Vice Chair for being here 
today, as well.
    But HUD plays a central but not singular role in Federal 
housing and community development policy. In some cases its 
programs actively partner with or supplement the work of other 
Federal agencies and state and local governments.
    HUD's programs also facilitate collaboration with both the 
private housing market and nonprofit service providers. These 
partnerships assist low-income working families, seniors, and 
people with disabilities, ranging from providing houses for 
those experiencing homelessness to enabling homeownership.
    They also support community and economic development 
activities in large urban areas as well as the small towns of 
Rural America.
    However, while these programs are important, they are not 
immune to the broader fiscal challenges that we face as a 
country. This year will require tough conversations around the 
national debit and the scale of Federal spending.
    As a fiscal conservative, I welcome these conversations as 
we work to set a clear path for the future of this great 
nation.
    The budget gimmicks of the past are not a sustainable path 
forward and they do not address the underlying issue of our 
ballooning national debt. As challenging as the broader fiscal 
issues are, the subcommittee is also starting from a 
particularly different position, difficult for this year.
    Federal Housing Administration, FHA, and Ginnie Mae 
receipts offset the cost of our bill. The Administration 
projects these offsetting receipts to be $4.9 billion lower 
this year than last year.
    However, this gap will likely increase even further once 
the Congressional Budget Office finishes scoring the budget 
request.
    A $5 to $7 billion shortfall would be bad enough but this 
will also be on top of the continued increases in the cost of 
maintaining current rental assistance because some costs were 
designated as emergency spending last year. This increase could 
be as much as six billion. Combined, the subcommittee faces a 
real prospect of a shortfall of a possibility of $13 billion 
just to maintain fiscal 2023 program levels.
    It's too early to know what our allocation will be or even 
what the fiscal year 2024 spending level will look like. 
However, it is clear we will need to make tough choices that 
numerous proposals in the President's Budget Request may not be 
accommodated.
    Instead, it will be important to try to improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the programs we fund within the 
constraints we have to operate.
    I look forward to working with Chairman Schatz and the rest 
of my colleagues in writing the fiscal responsible HUD bill 
that seeks to meet the needs of all Americans across the 
country.
    Secretary Fudge, once again, thank you for appearing before 
this committee today, and I truly appreciate your help in 
Mississippi.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Ranking Member Hyde-Smith.
    Are there members wishing to make an opening statement?
    If not, Secretary Fudge, please proceed with your 
testimony.

                 SUMMARY STATEMENT OF HON. MARCIA FUDGE

    Secretary Fudge. Thank you very much.
    Chairman Schatz and Ranking Member Hyde-Smith and 
Distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today in support of President Biden's 
2024 Budget.
    The support of this subcommittee is critical to ensuring 
every American has a roof over their head and can live in 
communities that are strong and resilient.
    This Administration believes that everyone deserves to live 
in a safe and affordable home. Whether you rent or own, having 
a good home in a neighborhood with opportunities sets the 
foundation for everything else in your life.
    Without a home, it is harder for a person to access good 
paying jobs and decent schools. It drives up costs for families 
and adds to inflationary pressures. That doesn't just hurt 
hard-working people. It hurts communities. A lack of affordable 
housing hinders the job market and stifles economic growth.
    President Biden understands in order to build an economy 
that works for all, we must invest in housing to expand supply, 
lower costs, improve access to rental options and 
homeownership, and advance efforts to end homelessness.
    As the President often says, a budget is a value statement. 
The Biden-Harris Administration values building and preserving 
affordable housing. We value rental affordability and housing 
fairness and, most of all, we value the people of this country, 
including the most vulnerable among us, and therefore we do not 
believe they should feel forced to sleep on the streets or 
under a park bench.
    The President's budget builds on the tremendous progress 
made over the last 2 years and demonstrates the Biden-Harris 
Administration's unwavering commitment to protecting all 
Americans, whether they live in big cities, small towns, rural 
communities, or tribal nations.
    President Biden is requesting $73 billion to fund HUD's 
core programs and initiatives and an additional $104 billion 
over the next decade to make the critical investments in 
affordable housing our country needs to address our housing 
affordability crisis.
    The President's budget represents a modest increase over 
2023-enacted levels, one that is necessary to ensure millions 
of families and communities can maintain access to services 
they rely on, including many of our most vulnerable citizens.
    The 2024 budget provides $32 billion for housing choice 
vouchers which can help an additional 180,000 low-income 
individuals and families find affordable housing, $3.7 billion 
to provide housing and services to individuals and families 
experiencing homelessness, $3.4 billion to give communities 
flexible resources they can use to create affordable housing, 
improve housing choice, and expand economic development.
    The President's budget includes $410 million in funding we 
need to remove and mitigate the threats posed by dangerous 
health hazards, like lead, carbon monoxide, radon, and fire 
from homes.
    It invests $752 million to support improving energy 
efficiency and resilience in HUD-assisted and finance 
developments and $90 million to support HUD's Fair Housing 
Programs.
    The President's budget supports full authorization of the 
Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery Program. I 
have traveled to communities across this country in many of 
your home states that have been devastated by disaster. Storms 
and wildfires are not getting any less severe. In fact, they 
are getting worse.
    The Federal Government must be able to quickly and 
effectively deploy resources. Full authorization of CDBG-DR 
will help us get there.
    Because the President values housing, his budget invests in 
building up HUD's internal staffing and IT capacity, not 
stripping it away. We cannot carry out our mission to end 
homelessness and protect affordable housing, something I know 
matters to everyone here, if we do not invest in the Federal 
agency and the Federal workers who are charged with doing that 
important work.
    The proposed budget for HUD funds programs that help the 
most vulnerable households in our country pay their rent, 
people with disabilities, low-income seniors, working single 
parents with children.
    Our programs touch every community, every town, every 
locality, but, most of all, they help people. They help 
American families, families from all walks of life with all 
manner of experiences who want what we all deserve, access to a 
safe and stable home that meets their needs, and I would say 
that I understand certainly budgetary concerns, but I would 
just ask that we would prioritize what is best for the people 
of this nation and not balance the budget on the backs of poor 
people or seniors or homeless people.
    It is important and I thank you so very much and I look 
forward to your questions.
    [The statement follows:]
    
                Prepared Statement of Hon. Marcia Fudge
                
    Chairman Schatz, Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, and distinguished 
Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify 
today in support of President Biden's 2024 Budget for the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The support of this Subcommittee 
is critical to ensuring that every American has a roof over their head 
and can live in communities that are strong and resilient.
    This Administration believes that everyone deserves to live in a 
safe and affordable home. Whether you rent or own, having a place to 
live that you can afford in a neighborhood with opportunities is the 
foundation for so much else in life.
    A lack of quality affordable housing hinders the job market and 
holds back economic growth by making it harder for workers to access 
good-paying jobs. It drives up costs for families and inflationary 
pressures.
    That's why the President's Budget includes a historic investment to 
lower housing costs, expand housing supply, improve access to 
affordable rental options and homeownership, and advance efforts to end 
homelessness.
    HUD's mission is critical to achieving the President's vision to 
build a better America--to ensure that every person has a shot to get 
ahead; to address longstanding systemic challenges, including racial 
injustice, rising inequality, and the climate crisis; to expand on the 
historic progress our country has made over the last year and deliver 
on the President's agenda laid out in his State of the Union address.
    This Budget builds on the tremendous progress made over the last 2 
years and demonstrates the Biden Administration's unwavering commitment 
to protecting our nation's most vulnerable populations.
    HUD is proposing a bold set of values and policies that prioritizes 
building and preserving affordable housing, promotes rental 
affordability and fairness, makes homeownership a reality for more 
first-time and first-generation homebuyers, and advances efforts to 
prevent evictions and end homelessness.

                     president biden's 2024 budget
                     
    The 2024 President's Budget requests $73.3 billion for HUD, 
approximately $1.1 billion more than the 2023 enacted funding level. In 
addition, it requests $104 billion over 10 years for new mandatory 
affordable housing investments. Together, this suite of funding and tax 
credits aims to tackle the Nation's housing affordability crisis by 
making a historic investment in lowering housing costs to further the 
Administration's commitment to rebuilding America from the bottom up 
and middle out.
    The Budget makes critical investments in the American people that 
will help lay a stronger foundation for shared growth and prosperity 
for generations to come.
    For HUD and those it serves, the Budget provides:

  --$32.7 billion for the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program, to 
        expand assistance to an additional 50,000 low-income 
        individuals and families.

  --$3.7 billion to provide housing and services to individuals and 
        families experiencing or at-risk of homelessness, including a 
        focus on survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, 
        sexual assault, stalking, and human trafficking, as well as 
        youth;

  --$3.4 billion for the Community Development Fund and $1.8 billion 
        for HOME Investment Partnerships, giving communities flexible 
        resources crucial to creating affordable housing, improving 
        housing choices, and expanding economic development;

  --$752 million to support energy efficiency and resilience in HUD-
        assisted and financed developments;

  --$410 million to remove dangerous health hazards from homes, 
        including mitigating threats from lead, carbon monoxide, radon 
        and fire;

  --$90 million for Fair Housing programs along with an increase in HUD 
        staff fair housing capacity to redress discriminatory housing 
        practices; and

  --$2.3 billion for Management and Administration expenses to ensure 
        HUD has the human capital and technology necessary to deliver 
        on its mission for the American people.

    The President's 2024 Budget supports authorizing the Community 
Development Block Grant--Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program. For more 
than twenty years, the Congress has appropriated emergency supplemental 
funds to HUD in response to major disasters to address the unmet long-
term disaster recovery needs of States, territories, local governments, 
and Tribes. Authorization would improve the transparency and 
predictability of CDBG-DR funds for impacted communities.
    At HUD, we understand that our homes represent more than four walls 
and a roof. A good home can serve as a platform for economic 
opportunity, good health, and strong families. How can a person hold 
down a job or take care of their health or children if they do not have 
a bed, shower, or stove?
    To further HUD's mission through this Budget, I have outlined five 
priorities:

  --Support Underserved Communities and Equitable Community 
        Development;

  --Increase Supply of and Access to Accessible, Affordable Housing;

  --Promote Homeownership Opportunities and Wealth-Building;

  --Advance Sustainable Communities, Climate Resilience, and 
        Environmental Justice; and

  --Strengthen HUD's Internal Capacity to Deliver Its Mission

  support underserved communities and equitable community development
  
    The Budget fortifies support for underserved communities and 
supports equitable community development for all people. To quickly 
house more people experiencing housing insecurity, the Budget provides 
$32.7 billion for the Housing Choice Voucher Program, an increase of 
over $2.4 billion over the 2023 enacted level, to maintain services for 
all currently assisted families and to expand assistance to an 
additional 50,000 households. The Budget also provides $8.9 billion for 
the Public Housing Fund, which provides grants to Public Housing 
Authorities to operate, maintain, and make capital improvements for the 
approximately 1.7 million residents of public housing. The Budget also 
addresses the nation's homelessness crisis, providing $3.75 billion, an 
increase of $116 million over the 2023 enacted level, for Homeless 
Assistance Grants. Additionally, the Budget provides $3.3 billion for 
the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) formula program, for 
developing viable urban and rural communities by expanding economic 
opportunities, and $90 million for fair housing programs for targeted 
and coordinated enforcement, education, and outreach.

       ensure access to and increase supply of affordable housing
       
    Today, there's a shortage of almost 7 million affordable housing 
units. For every 100 extremely low-income renters, there are only 33 
rentals available. The Budget works to expand housing production to 
help meet housing demand and to provide equitable access to housing 
opportunities for all people. It provides $1.8 billion for the HOME 
Investment Partnerships (HOME) Program, which has long served as an 
anchor of the nation's affordable housing system. The Budget proposes 
over $16 billion to fully fund renewals and amendments in Project- 
Based Rental Assistance, Housing for Persons with Disabilities, and 
Housing for the Elderly Programs, along with $258 million for new 
development of approximately 2,200 new units of Section 202 Housing for 
the Elderly and Section 811 Housing for People with Disabilities. The 
Budget also proposes Ginnie Mae authority to securitize affordable 
multifamily housing loans made by Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) and 
insured under the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 542(c) 
Risk-Sharing program.
    The Budget also proposes a new $61 million program account, 
Operational Performance Evaluations and Risk Assessments (OPERA), that 
will improve HUD's inspection capacity. It will streamline the funding 
for financial, health, and safety inspections to over 2.4 million units 
of subsidized and affordable housing across HUD. It will also increase 
HUD's data analytic capabilities, which will help assess trends and 
keep residents safe.
    Finally, the Budget includes a $104 billion package of new 
mandatory affordable housing investments that will occur over 10 years, 
including $60 billion that would be administered through HUD. Together, 
this suite of funding and tax credits aims to tackle the Nation's 
housing affordability crisis by making a historic investment in curbing 
housing cost growth, expanding housing production, and providing 
resources to renters to avoid eviction and further the Administration's 
commitment to rebuilding America at all levels.

        promote homeownership opportunities and wealth-building
        
    The Budget promotes homeownership and wealth-building 
opportunities, including equitable access to credit for home purchases 
and improvements, for underserved borrowers, including first-time, low-
to-moderate income and minority homebuyers. It provides $15 million in 
credit subsidy and other expenses for an FHA Small Balance Mortgage 
demonstration program that would increase access to mortgages for 
lower-priced homes, for which affordably priced mortgages are currently 
scarce. The Budget also provides a new $100 million set- aside under 
the HOME Program for the FirstHOME Downpayment Assistance initiative 
that would provide funding to States and insular areas to better 
support sustainable homeownership for first-generation and/or low-
wealth first-time homebuyers. Additionally, to make homeownership more 
affordable starting this year, FHA recently reduced the annual mortgage 
insurance premiums for new borrowers by about one-third.

advance sustainable communities, climate resilience, and environmental 
                                justice
                                
    The Budget advances sustainable communities by strengthening 
climate resilience and energy efficiency, promoting environmental 
justice, and recognizing housing's role as essential to health. It 
provides $752 million in targeted climate resilience and energy 
efficiency improvements in public housing, Tribal housing, multifamily-
assisted housing, and other assisted housing. As part of this funding, 
the Budget provides $185 million to help communities develop and 
implement locally driven comprehensive plans to transform neighborhoods 
with distressed public and assisted housing. Finally, it provides $410 
million to remove dangerous health hazards from homes, including 
mitigating threats from lead, carbon monoxide, radon, and fire.
       
       strengthen hud's internal capacity to deliver its mission
       
    The Budget builds on HUD's efforts to restore staffing to levels 
that can adequately and successfully deliver HUD's services. This 
Administration is committed to recruiting and retaining the human 
capital needed to properly monitor compliance on properties, loans, 
grants, and public housing authorities, as well as tackling the 
systemic issues inside the Department that occurred over the previous 
two decades as the result of the steady decline in staffing. Using 
workforce succession strategies, the Department intends to ensure that 
additional staffing results in the right people filling the right jobs, 
providing the biggest impact toward achieving HUD's priorities. The 
2024 Budget requests $1.9 billion toward salaries and expenses (S&E), 
$155 million more than the 2023 enacted level which, in combination 
with carryover of 2023 funding, will support 8,635 full-time equivalent 
(FTE) employees. The Budget will support staffing gains made since 
2020, and additional increases in 2024. These critical resources will 
enable the Department to serve households and communities more 
effectively and efficiently across the country. The 2024 Budget funds 
initiatives that comply with Federal mandates to improve the customer 
experience so that program interactions are easier and more effective 
and efficient for HUD customers.
    The Budget also proposes $415 million for the IT Fund and includes 
$12 million within the S&E topline to fund IT device expenditures 
through the Working Capital Fund. The Budget continues to invest in 
much needed modernization of HUD's IT systems, infrastructure, and 
cybersecurity. These investments will help ensure that HUD has the 
resources and capacity to meet the critical work ahead. The technology 
resources support grantees and partners in their efforts to promote 
affordable rental housing, provide access to homeownership 
opportunities, create healthier home environments, and reduce 
homelessness.
    In summary, HUD's proposed Budget funds programs and offices to 
further HUD's mission, which is to create strong, sustainable, 
inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all. The Budget 
delivers on these commitments, and I am pleased to share this request 
with the Subcommittee.
    Chairman Schatz, Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, and distinguished 
Members of the Subcommittee, I look forward to working with you. Thank 
you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss my 
priorities for the Department and how the President's 2024 Budget will 
serve our most vulnerable citizens, increase the resilience of our 
communities, and tackle the challenges facing our Nation.

    Senator Schatz. Thank you very much, Secretary.
    I know you are preparing your first round of MB grants and 
IO want to make sure of one thing. I just want to make sure 
that these are grants not for planning but for the 
implementation of up-zoning and the reduction in whatever 
regulations are impeding the development of housing generally.
    When we talked through this program both verbally but also 
in the legislative process, I really wanted to avoid pushing 
out a bunch of money to a bunch of consultants who would tell a 
bunch of city councils what to do and I want to be reassured 
that we're not doing that.
    Secretary Fudge. I assure you, Senator, we are not doing 
that.
    We realize that it is important to go directly to these 
communities and not only to talk with them about the programs, 
which we have, but to assure that they do not think they're 
going to get resources just because they say we'll look at it.
    We want to have outcomes that are positive because we can't 
afford the time to go through a lot of hoops. We need the 
housing. Just quite frankly, we need to talk with people about 
the issues, not just Federal issues but state and local issues, 
as well, I assure you, sir.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you.
    And what's your timing for rollout?
    Secretary Fudge. Let's see. Oh, the no-zone funding is 
going to be coming out fairly soon. I don't have the date, but 
I can get it to you.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you.
    A lot of states are using Medicaid waivers to support case 
management and housing-related services. In practice, a lot of 
homeless service providers are struggling with delays and 
complications with billing anything that's Medicaid-related.
    Having run a nonprofit before that for language translation 
services and mental health services billed Medicaid, it's a 
tough business, and I'm wondering what you can do to help these 
homeless service providers to kind of, you know, get their 
systems up and running. To have a relatively small homeless 
service provider shop that is equipped on the fiscal side, on 
the billing side, to deal with Medicaid is a big challenge.
    I'm wondering what HUD can do to help everybody.
    Secretary Fudge. Well, HUD and HHS have launched a joint 
technical assistance center. So what we are doing is talking to 
communities about how they go around some of the regulations 
that we think are being restrictive, but, as well, provide 
technical assistance as to how they can reach more people.
    So I think that between Health and Human Services and HUD 
we are doing a pretty good job of getting to people to talk to 
them about how we work together to make sure we can provide the 
services because the one thing that people are finally 
connecting is that health and housing are very closely tied and 
related.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you.
    The budget once again proposes to conduct the continuum of 
care competition every 2 years instead of annually. How does 
this help?
    Secretary Fudge. Well, it helps because it takes hundreds 
of hours annually to prepare these proposals. It would be 
better spent spending money and time on the people who we serve 
and the other thing it does is it gives some consistency so 
they're not worried about how they're going to pay their staff 
from year to year. Maybe they now know I've got staff for 2 
years as opposed to one. I have resources for 2 years as 
opposed to one and it encourages real confidence in the 
program. So we think the outcomes will be better.
    Senator Schatz. I think that's right, by the way. I think 
it's really important that we do that. Having run a nonprofit, 
if you're on a year-to-year grant, it's hard to hire people 
because they know, you know, if you're a not-for-profit and 
you're competing with, you know, the Federal Government or the 
private sector in terms of getting a medical director or a 
psychologist or a psychiatric nurse or whatever it is, and 
they're looking at this thing thinking it's a maximum, it's 
probably 30 percent less pay but on top of that it's maximum a 
year gig, depending on whether we get renewed, it just doesn't 
work.
    The final question. I mentioned this in my opener around 
the specific observations that my staff made. Four inspections 
all from HUD for four different lines of funding from HUD, and 
I would just like your commitment to work this and to get some 
sort of standardization, and I'd like to know if there's some 
statutory problem that we can fix so that we don't have the 
same agency coming back at different part of the agency.
    If it's a matter of Federal law, please let us know. If 
it's not, please fix it.
    Secretary Fudge. You have my commitment.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you.
    Secretary Fudge. What we know is that we do need to 
standardize some things. That's one of the things we've been 
working on. I think that you will be pleased by the end of this 
year as we roll out more of our national standards, but I would 
suggest that we are required to follow the language and 
appropriations for different programs and so I was talking to 
someone from Tribal.
    We had a meeting with our tribal leaders last week. He 
says, ``I understand environmental, but we don't have a radon 
problem. Why are you making me test for radon?'' So those are 
some things that we are trying to work through.
    Senator Schatz. Yeah. Thank you very much.
    Ranking Member Hyde-Smith.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. I'll be glad to yield my time to Vice 
Chairman Collins.
    Senator Collins. Thank you.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Secretary Fudge, as I noted in my 
opening remarks, the recent storms and tornados in Mississippi 
have had a devastating effect on Rolling Forks, Silver City. 
Egypt, Amery, across four counties, and many communities, and 
we certainly appreciate the President's commitment to the 
people of Mississippi and the FEMA assistance that is already 
on the ground to make a difference and also appreciate HUD 
rolling out the program waivers and its disaster response 
toolbox. That is very appreciated.
    Although the data on unmet needs is still coming together, 
it's never too early to think about the longer-term recovery 
needs of these communities and families.
    The fiscal year 2023 Omnibus provided three billion in 
additional CDBG-DR funding, of which 162 million remain after 
taking care of earlier 2022 disasters.
    Madam Secretary, what are HUD's plans for allocating the 
162 million remaining from the fiscal year 2023 Omnibus?
    Secretary Fudge. First, let me just say thank you for 
having a conversation with me about this earlier. I appreciate 
your time.
    We do have $162 million remaining, but we have yet to get 
all of the information and data in from the storms in Florida 
and from other places. We know this $162 million is not going 
to go very far. We are generally in the ballpark of $3 to $4 
billion for storms for 2021 and 2022. We don't see that 2023 is 
going to be any different, especially as it has started out the 
way it has.
    So the $162 million is more than likely going to go to 
Selma, to California for the floods, and to Florida. So right 
now those funds are allocated, but we will be coming to you for 
an authorization as soon as we get data in from Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Okay. Thank you for that answer, and 
I'm a firm believer in the importance of financial literacy 
education, have been for many, many years when I was in the 
state legislature, but while it should be taught more in 
schools, these educational opportunities should be also 
available to adults, as well, and I'm pleased that HUD's budget 
includes funding for programs like Ross to help public housing 
residents develop the skills they need to end cycles of 
dependency or housing counseling to help families become 
successful homeowners.
    However, I am concerned that the request only level funds 
for Ross and core housing counseling program and misses the 
opportunity to invest more in expanding financial literacy to 
more families.
    While not requesting additional funding, how is the 
department working to increase the availability of financial 
literacy education and resources to the individuals and 
families served through the HUD program?
    Secretary Fudge. Well, on May 1st we're going to be 
participating in a summit that addresses family self-
sufficiency. It is a program that is very successful throughout 
our HUD Developments, be it public housing and, as well, 
multifamily housing.
    We recently launched a new asset-building cohort through 
our Moving to Work. We have included resources for housing 
counseling to assist with financing in particular.
    So I think that we are working very diligently to give 
those that we serve the opportunity to learn about financing, 
to save money. We are trying to move people from public housing 
into homeownership. So we are working very, very diligently to 
be sure that we prepare people for better financing, better 
outcomes in their lives.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you.
    And when it comes to homelessness, we've talked about that 
a little bit already, a lot of the attention is focused on the 
large numbers of homeless individuals on the West Coast and 
given the numbers, not unreasonably so, but, however, with this 
attention it is easy to lose sight of the challenges of 
homelessness faced by other communities, especially in rural 
areas, where there are fewer shelters and supportive services 
and where it's easier to under-count the number of homeless 
individuals.
    HUD's Point in Time count for 2022 notes that while 
homelessness increased nationally by 0.3 percent from 2020 to 
2022, in rural areas the increase was six percent, and while 
urban homelessness is certainly a problem, is the department 
equally committed to addressing homelessness in the underserved 
and under-resourced areas of the country, as well?
    Secretary Fudge. Absolutely. Just this week, we announced a 
total of $66 million in awards that are specifically targeting 
homelessness in rural areas, and we had some awards earlier in 
the year, as well. So we are very, very keenly aware of the 
problem in rural communities, especially because in rural 
communities you find a great deal of unsheltered homelessness. 
So we are directing resources to rural communities.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. I'm seeing more of the encampments in 
different places and, you know, there definitely is an 
increase, and my time has expired.
    Thank you.
    Senator Schatz. Vice Chair Collins.
    Senator Collins. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Before the clock starts ticking down, I just want to thank 
you and the Ranking Member for your leadership on this 
subcommittee. I care deeply about this subcommittee and the 
issues that you'll be handling, having been either the chairman 
or the ranking member for many years, and it's great to know 
that it's in such good hands with both of you. So thank you.
    Secretary Fudge, let me begin with a big thank you to you. 
Last year I asked you for assistance on behalf of the City of 
Bangor where I live in handling an influx of unsheltered 
homeless individuals and families and it led to encampments all 
over the city and the city was at a loss as to how to deal with 
this sudden problem.
    You sent an expert team to Bangor which has worked for 
months with the city and I want to report to you that just 
recently they were able to take down one of the encampments on 
Valley Avenue in Bangor and find homes for each of the 
individuals who had been living in the encampment, a tremendous 
success, and the city officials have been so pleased with the 
expertise and the suggestions and recommendations that the HUD 
team brought. So I truly want to thank you for that.
    More recently, I've discussed with you a request from the 
City of Portland which had a tremendous influx, a thousand 
people since January, for example, of unsheltered individuals 
and families who are asylum seekers who have come to Portland.
    So they need your help, as well, and again I appreciate 
your willingness to assist us.
    One part, one challenge is encouraging private owners and 
landlords to house these individuals who have been unsheltered. 
They tend to view particularly those that are chronically 
homeless as challenging tenants and I encourage them to work 
with HUD, to work with local officials, but do you have any 
advice from HUD on how communities not only in Maine but across 
the country can engage private owners and landlords in this 
process of providing homes for the unsheltered?
    Secretary Fudge. Yes, and thank you so much. Our teams were 
really excited about the outcomes and are already talking with 
Portland.
    Senator Collins. Great.
    Secretary Fudge. So we're already in conversations with 
their team.
    We do know that getting landlords involved is a very 
difficult situation, but one of the things we've found is that 
for certain rental properties, if we give them a master lease, 
it makes it so much easier for them to work. So that's one of 
the things we're doing.
    We're looking at how we can provide toolkits and resources 
to explain to them why it's a good thing to be involved. We're 
talking about finding incentives for landlords so that they 
will lease especially to homeless, but I think that we all 
understand it's a problem but we are working on it and I think 
that we're doing really very well because when we sit down and 
have conversations with them, then they find that we are a very 
stable source of resources, that we will assist them beyond 
just that one rental. So we're working and it's getting better. 
It's not where we want it to be but it is getting better.
    Senator Collins. Thank you.
    There are two groups who find themselves homeless that 
particularly concern me. One are young people who are aging out 
of foster care and what I found is that in some states at age 
18 you're out of the foster care system, even if you're still 
in high school. That assistance is cut off. That breaks my 
heart, and there are very few youth shelters. There's an 
excellent one called New Beginnings in Lewiston, Maine, but 
generally they don't exist, and for someone who's already gone 
through a difficult situation, a young person, and thus is in 
foster care, to find themselves at an arbitrary age when 
they're still in school to no longer have the services of 
foster care is very sad to me.
    I led the creation of a youth homelessness demonstration 
program and we do have family unification vouchers and we 
obviously need to improve the child welfare system, but in the 
absence of those improvements, I'm concerned that the budget 
does not provide any funding for these families, any additional 
funding for the family unification vouchers.
    Instead, you're proposing a much larger mandatory program 
but no new vouchers for family unification, and my question for 
you on that is why isn't there funding in the budget for those 
essential vouchers?
    Secretary Fudge. We did just in March of this year announce 
the availability of about $30 million in Foster Youth to 
Independence Program. So that has already been done.
    We are also--of course, your Youth Demonstration Grant has 
been awarded to states across the country, as well, earlier 
this year.
    The President's budget does talk about youth vouchers for 
2024 in the mandatory and I think that you're right. I don't 
disagree with the way that you are suggesting that we might go 
about it and it's something that we can talk with him about.
    Senator Collins. Great. And finally, if you'll indulge me 
just a quick--the second segment that I'm really concerned 
about in our population is we're seeing a growing number of 
older adults who are unsheltered.
    The Point in Time Survey that HUD does focuses on three 
groups, those under 18, those between 18 and 24, and then above 
24, which is a pretty large category, and what I'm hearing is 
we're seeing people who are homeless who are over age 50, who 
are even over age 65, and that's a change in the composition of 
the unsheltered population that really concerns me.
    So aside from the current Point in Time data which really 
doesn't focus on that older group as much, does HUD have 
available either internally or from other Federal or state 
partners more data so that we can figure out what's going on 
with that older population and how to meet their needs?
    Secretary Fudge. Well, it's estimated, Senator, that in 
2020 those that are over 55 years of age made up 17.9 percent 
of all the homeless people and those who are chronically 
homeless, that 55 and older number, makes up 30 percent.
    We don't have enough senior housing. We don't have enough 
housing that is affordable to seniors, and we don't have enough 
housing in this country where people can age in place and so 
with those things, in addition to seniors being on fixed 
incomes and the rents going sky high, they are being forced and 
pushed to the street.
    We are very, very aware of what is going on, but we know 
the answer is more senior housing, more affordable housing, and 
taking a look at how in this nation we can allow people to age 
in place. So it's something--I was at a conference. It's 
happening in other countries, too. I was at a conference in 
Germany. They're having the same problem, but these are the G7 
ministers that are talking. Housing is on their agenda, as 
well. Same thing in Asian nations.
    We're trying to find ways to keep people in their homes, 
but it is acute here at this stage of the game. So I'm glad 
that you're aware of it and we can talk about some ideas, but 
we have some ideas that we'd like to work on.
    Senator Collins. Great. Thank you very much, Madam 
Secretary, and thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Schatz. Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Madam Secretary, great to see you. Always welcome you in 
Maryland and thanks for all that you've done for the country 
and for our state of Maryland. You know well that we're facing 
an affordable housing crisis in the United States and I 
appreciate many of the requests and initiatives in this budget 
to work to address that, including your request for an increase 
in housing vouchers.
    I'm in the process right now of working with Senator Young 
in reintroducing a bill that we've introduced each year, each 
Congress called The Family Stability and Opportunity Vouchers 
Act, which is especially focused on providing opportunities for 
families with young kids to move to areas of greater 
opportunity, and we appreciate the provisions in your budget 
that include some of the additional funding for mobility 
services and the wrap-around services that are so important to 
make that successful and all the data and all the studies 
indicate that this can be an effective way for helping families 
pull themselves out of poverty.
    So I want to make sure that we focus with you and the 
department on that going forward.
    Also appreciate all your efforts when it comes to the 
Choice Neighborhood Programs and in Baltimore City we are 
continuing to deal with the legacy of systemic racism and 
segregation and this program, the Choice Neighborhoods Program, 
I think is an important tool to begin to address that because, 
as you know, it calls for mixed use development.
    One of the challenges we face as a result of segregation 
and neighborhoods that have been left behind are things like 
food deserts, lack of opportunity, and so one of the grants 
that was recently received was a $10 million grant to something 
called Perkins Homes, which is a mixed use project in Baltimore 
City.
    Could you just speak briefly to using this program as a 
tool to try to revitalize neighborhoods?
    Secretary Fudge. Choice Neighborhood Grants are 
transformational. They can go up to about $35 million. They 
truly transform neighborhoods and communities. We think it's an 
outstanding program. We find that communities that have used 
these resources have made significant changes not just in the 
actual fabric of the community based upon new housing but 
people feel better about it. People feel good about living in 
these--most of them end up being mixed use. People very much 
appreciate it and what it allows us to do is get away from the 
whole idea of segregating poverty which is something that we 
have done for far too long.
    So they've been very, very effective. I mean, the 
competition for the grants, it keeps us up at night so many 
people looking to get these grants, but they're going very 
well, very, very well.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, thank you for your continued 
efforts in that area because we look forward to working with 
you. It's been very effective in helping certain neighborhoods 
in Baltimore City. We have a long way to go, make no mistake, 
but it's a very important tool.
    As you well know, in addition to making sure we have more 
affordable housing vouchers, the supply of housing is also a 
direct factor when it comes to the high cost. We need to 
increase supply, including supply of middle income housing, and 
one of the things I've been hearing about from a number of 
Maryland constituents is concern about the backlog in the 
middle income housing developments that are completing 
construction and one of the impediments there has been what 
they say are delays in receiving information on the approval 
process for their FHA-insured multifamily loans.
    We're hearing--you know, heard a little bit about this 
months ago, hearing more and more about it now. Madam 
Secretary, if you could just talk to that and assure me that we 
can work together to address this issue.
    Secretary Fudge. I assure you we did have a backlog for 
some time. There's no more backlog. So they should be getting 
information very, very quickly and if they're not, they should 
let us know that.
    Senator Van Hollen. Okay. Thank you. We may well be in 
touch on that, but I appreciate your willingness to quickly 
work this out. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Schatz. Ranking Member Hyde-Smith.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And, Madam Secretary, one of the core aspects of the 
Section 8 Voucher Program is the public/private partnership 
between PHAs and landlords, and however the success of this 
program, the cornerstone of Federal rental assistance is 
undercut by both the general shortage of affordable housing 
that we've talked about as well as the willingness of private 
landowners to participate and remain in the program and the 
folks that I've talked to in Mississippi, it's not necessarily 
the tenants, it's the administrative burdens of the voucher 
program drive the owners and landlords to leave the program.
    So I know HUD is aware of these challenges while also 
balancing the need for reasonable oversight of taxpayer 
dollars, but what update can you provide the committee on the 
department's effort to streamline program's regulations so the 
landlords will want to stay in this program?
    Secretary Fudge. Senator, let me just say, and I'd say it 
to everyone, we know that we over-regulate some programs and we 
are working to change it, and I come from your side of the 
table. So for 13 years I was the one saying you need to change 
these things, but now that I'm there, we are doing our very 
best to change it.
    We are working with our partners, both here in the House 
and the Senate. We are talking to landlords. We're talking to 
our people on the ground to figure out what we can do better.
    We know there are a lot of regulations. I was not aware, 
Senator Schatz, of the five inspections, but we do know that 
there are situations that we can correct, some we can do in-
house, some require that the Senate and/or the House take 
action, and so we are isolating those things that we need to 
bring to you and say can you assist us with making these 
adjustments statutorily and the things that we can do, we are 
trying to do, as well, because we know it is a problem.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Wonderful. And a substantial number of 
HUD programs have expired authorization, as you're well aware 
of, and the CDBG Home and the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction 
authorizations expired in 1994. The authorizations for HUD's 
Public Housing, Housing for the Elderly, and Section 8 Voucher 
Programs expired in 2003, while Homeless Assistance Grants 
expired in 2011.
    While these are only some of the unauthorized programs, 
they account for 71 percent of HUD's fiscal year 2024 requests.
    So what is the Administration's plans for working with 
HUD's Authorization Committees this year to not just create new 
programs but also to modernize its core programs?
    Secretary Fudge. Well, I'm not a big fan of creating new 
programs. I'll just be honest with you. I think we have a lot 
of them. There are sometimes because of the way this body 
operates we are required to stand up new programs, based upon 
some of the funding we receive, but it's not something that we 
very much like to do because it takes us a long time to stand 
up a new program.
    But we do know that most of our current programs do have at 
least some underlying statutory authority to operate. We do 
need to reauthorize some of them and we're trying to determine 
which ones in priority we need to reauthorize, but we are clear 
on the fact that there are some things that we need to do that 
haven't been done in a very long time.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. In discussing the FHA and the Ginnie 
Mae receipts offsets and funding needed for the annual T-HUD 
bill and the budget request, you know, anticipates the declines 
that we've talked about, but however the Congressional Budget 
Office February baseline estimate has these receipts at only 
$3.3 billion.
    The estimate was produced prior to HUD's reducing the 
mortgage insurance premium which the Administration has 
estimated to reduce receipts by $2.5 billion, but as the actual 
dollars, the budget request anticipates offsetting receipts 
will decline from $10.3 billion in 2023 to only $5.5 billion in 
2024, a reduction of $4.8 billion.
    So this means the final receipt amount the committee has to 
use could be roughly $9.5 billion lower this year compared to 
last year. So given the FHA's premium reduction was largely 
offset by the Federal Reserve's long-expected rate increase 
last month, what do we really get for that $2.5 billion cost?
    Secretary Fudge. Let me say a couple of things. We were 
going to be at a loss no matter what we did. Interest rates 
have made it so that people are not buying homes. People are 
not refinancing homes. So we were going to have a reduction 
anyway.
    What we believed because in the fund, the mortgage 
insurance premium fund, is about at $142 billion, I think 
that's the number, some place in that ballpark, and so we 
believe that it was not appropriate to continue to charge 
persons who are trying to purchase homes with those resources 
when we're sitting on that kind of money. It just wasn't right, 
just was not the right thing to do.
    The other thing that it did was it did give some relief in 
a very high interest environment, it gave some relief to low-
income borrowers and that's what we're trying to do. We're 
trying to get people into homes.
    But I would say that FHA is extremely--doing very, very 
well. We are solvent to a point where you are asking us to keep 
2 percent above. We're at an eleven percent. Ginnie Mae is 
doing well. We are doing extremely well and we continue to fund 
the Federal Government at rates that no other agency does.
    So we just did not believe that it was the right thing to 
do to continue to ask poor people and people first-time 
homebuyers, first generation homebuyers to continue to bear the 
burden that they should not bear.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Schatz. Senator Coons.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Chairman Schatz, Ranking Member 
Hyde-Smith.
    Wonderful to be with you again, Madam Secretary.
    Secretary Fudge. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you for your visit to Delaware and for 
your attentiveness and engagement around the ongoing challenges 
we face providing safe, sanitary, affordable, decent housing to 
the American people.
    I am frankly thrilled that you are leading this department 
at this critical time.
    Secretary Fudge. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. As you well know from your years of 
experience in public service, the Housing Choice Voucher 
Program which was just referred to by the Ranking Member is a 
significant, robust, and critical tool for the department.
    Senator Kramer and I have reintroduced our bipartisan bill 
to expand the supply of housing by partnering with landlords, 
to draw more landlords into the program, and to increase the 
scope in my own community where, as you know, I was in county 
government for a decade, six as the county executive. That 
supply was critical.
    I'd also be interested in hearing from you what initiatives 
the department is taking and what we could be doing here to 
increase supply because affordability of housing is directly 
related to supply and in this challenging interest rate 
environment, you can, should, and will make critical 
investments in affordable housing programs, but we also need to 
do things at the state and local level to increase supply.
    I'd be interested if you could briefly speak to what 
initiatives you'd like to see us taking around supply.
    Secretary Fudge. There are two things, I think, that are 
going to be very, very helpful.
    One is if we can at least try to meet the President's 
request for home resources in the budget because it would 
provide us about 15,000 units of affordable housing for new 
homebuyers, another 1,300 units of newly constructed 
properties, and more than 6,000 units of owner-occupied or 
rehabilitated properties.
    But the other thing we have to do is look at all of it in 
context. So we're looking at how we can either put more 
resources into the Low-Income Tax Credit Program that Treasury 
wants. We are looking at how we can better use housing finance 
agencies to assist with low-cost loans, how we can do more work 
and put more resources in the Housing Trust Fund.
    It's a combination of things, but the biggest thing right 
now is HOME because it's the most flexible resource----
    Senator Coons. Yes.
    Secretary Fudge [continuing]. We give to communities.
    Senator Coons. As you may know, I'm leading the letter here 
in the Senate, as you for many years did in the House, and look 
forward to fighting for the Home Allocation. It was a Home and 
CDBG were the two key tools I had as county executive to work 
with nonprofit affordable housing providers.Monday I got to be 
at a ribbon-cutting for a new affordable housing multifamily 
project, small, but in one of our most challenged and burdened 
neighborhoods. Be Ready, Jesus is Coming Church Community 
Development Corporation, delightful, sadly recently passed 
away, Pastor Lottie Lee had this vision that she would take a 
whole block of dilapidated properties that were nearly falling 
down and transform them into beautiful state of the art 
housing. That was possible through the Federal Home Loan Bank 
of Pittsburgh, an underappreciated resource, Home Dollar CDBG 
dollars, and, frankly, CDS, an earmark from our congressional 
delegation.
    Let me talk, if I could impose on the Chairman, for two 
more things.
    I do want to make sure that you hear again my enthusiasm. 
Combating homelessness is a lifelong passion of mine. I worked 
with the National Coalition for the Homeless when I was a young 
man and Delaware has made real progress in combating, nearly 
ending veteran homelessness, but youth homelessness is on the 
rise, and I was encouraged to see that HUD has a youth 
homelessness demonstration project. I look forward to working 
with you to strengthen it and to sustain it and I hope that we 
can and will do more to combat youth homelessness in 
particular.
    Matt Heckles, your Region 3 Director, and the HUD staff in 
Delaware are terrific, very engaged, and I hope on your next 
visit I'll have the opportunity to join you.
    REACH Riverside, as we have discussed before, is a terrific 
example of the purpose-built communities model. I believe 
there's two communities in the Cleveland area, Buckeye Woodhill 
and Glenville, where you've seen that sort of place-based 
multifactor community rebuilding program.
    I am hopeful that REACH Riverside will get your attention. 
I continue to work hard. It's one of my top priorities for 
investment in my community.
    Last thing I just wanted to mention is that I think the 
Choice Neighborhoods Program is one that could use more 
resources. I think it has flexibility, I think it has promise, 
but I think it's under-resourced and I'd be interested in your 
thoughts on how Choice Neighborhoods is moving going forward.
    Secretary Fudge. Well, I agree with you, quite frankly, 
that we do need more resources. I mean, I'm looking now at the 
fact that Wilmington is a finalist in that last round.
    Senator Coons. Yes, ma'am.
    Secretary Fudge. And we're still looking--the program 
obviously--the competition is still underway, but I don't know 
of any community that could not use the resources of a Choice 
Neighborhood.
    Senator Coons. Yes.
    Secretary Fudge. Certainly we don't have the resources to 
give them to every community, but they are not only 
transformational but they are life-changing and I think that 
that's part of what we do.
    Youth Homes is a problem that I think people did not 
realize the gravity of it until the last few years and it is a 
major issue in this country.
    We talked about youth aging out of foster care. They get 
out of foster care at 18 and they're on the streets, no place 
to go, no resources. So we have found that the numbers of youth 
homes is just continuing to rise. So we are putting resources 
in the 2024 budget to deal specifically with youth aging out of 
foster care.
    Senator Coons. You visited Westside Center which is 
building housing specifically for youth aging out of that 
circumstance and I think this deserves our attention and you've 
got in me an enthusiastic partner to the extent you need 
authorizing help or to the extent you need any more support.
    I know we have a very talented Chair and Ranking of this 
subcommittee. So you probably don't need my help, but to the 
extent I can be helpful I'd love to.
    Thank you for what you and your very talented team to.
    Secretary Fudge. I always need your help, Senator, always.
    Senator Coons. Thank you very much, Madam Secretary. Thank 
you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Schatz. And we always need your help, Senator 
Coons. Thank you.
    Senator Schatz. Ranking Member Hyde-Smith brought up a 
couple of points that I thought were important.
    First of all, I just want to agree with her that I 
understand that the idea behind providing some relief on the 
cost of a mortgage but I think it's fair to say that whatever 
relief we provided, you know, sort of blows a hole in our 
budget and is washed away by the Fed doing what the Fed is 
doing and so I just think we ought to be real cautious about 
that because I understand it averages out to about $800 worth 
of savings, which is not trivial but again in the interest rate 
environment in which we're operating, I think what we did was 
sort of cannibalize our budget and not make enough of an impact 
for it to be worth it. That's just my view.
    I also want to talk about CDBG-DR. I know that Ranking 
Member Hyde-Smith is anxious to kind of understand what the 
remaining unallocated resources--you know, how they're spoken 
for, how much is available, when money will be coming to her 
home state to provide the kind of relief that is necessary, and 
this is exactly the kind of thing that a permanent 
authorization for DR would solve and that's why I'm pleased 
that we're going to introduce another bipartisan bill to get 
this thing finally done.
    You know, the difficulty we had with former Senator Toomey 
is that he just didn't like the principal of allowing towns to 
rebuild after a disaster because he did not fundamentally think 
it was a Federal responsibility and he didn't want to authorize 
a new program. Fair enough, but I think the rest of us, you 
know, living in the real world, when you have a disaster in 
your home state or your hometown, you understand we're going to 
spend this money anyway to provide disaster relief.
    The question is whether or not we have a permanent 
authorization to do it in an intelligent, predictable, 
responsive, accountable way, and that's what a permanent 
authorization of CDBGDR would do.
    I'm wondering if you'd comment on that.
    Secretary Fudge. You know, Senator, I was in Kentucky last 
month from the major storms that hit in a very, very rural part 
of Kentucky. We still have people sleeping in tents 7 months 
after a storm because once FEMA goes in because they've got a 
permanent authorization, they go in and do their work. By the 
time we can get there, six or 7 months have passed and people 
are struggling.
    It doesn't make sense for us to not be able to go in and 
help people quickly.
    Senator Schatz. And it doesn't save a penny----
    Secretary Fudge. No.
    Senator Schatz [continuing]. And that's the point here. 
It'd be one thing if we're having a conversation about fiscal 
discipline or whatever it is, but the way to exert fiscal 
discipline is to have a program, have accountability not just 
to spend the money after a bunch of suffering.
    We're going to spend this money, we might as well do it in 
as efficient a way as possible.
    Two more quick questions. I understand that FHA multifamily 
approvals have dropped about 75 percent. Senator Van Hollen 
mentioned that. Is that true, and are we fixing this? That 
seems alarming.
    Secretary Fudge. You know, let me get back to you. I don't 
know that that's an accurate number, but I'm looking at my--
we'll get back with you on that because I'm not sure and I 
don't want to give you----
    Senator Schatz. Does that sound wrong to you? I'm looking 
at your staff.
    Secretary Fudge. I don't think it is accurate.
    Senator Schatz. I hope it's wrong.
    Secretary Fudge. But I don't want to give you a wrong 
answer.
    Senator Schatz. But if multifamily approvals have dropped 
at any level, we need to understand why and also if we're 
getting different answers from different people within FHA, we 
just sort of need to understand exactly what's going on.
    Finally, homelessness in tribal areas, particularly among 
young people, is a major concern, and we've pushed hard to 
include tribes as eligible recipients for funding for homeless 
youth.
    Can you execute on that without a change in Federal law?
    Secretary Fudge. I do believe we can, yes.
    Senator Schatz. Okay. Can you give me an update as quickly 
as possible on where we are with that?
    And then the final question is, you know, you said 
something really important, which is a lot of Secretaries will 
not admit that they over-regulate, right, but I think you have 
the wisdom of having come from the Legislative Branch and also 
just understanding that whatever thicket of processes and 
procedures and rules and laws that you inherited is not your 
fault and so you might as well be the turnaround person rather 
than the defender of the status quo.
    What I'd like from you, and I'll reduce this to writing, 
but I don't want to over-complicate it by listing out all the 
regulatory barriers, is just a general overview on what key 
regulatory barriers you see and what I mean by that is 
congressional act, internal procedure, rule, anything, right, 
anything that is a sort of requirement, whether it's required 
by Federal law or just this is the way we do it, right, and I 
want you to sort out first by priority but also by category so 
that we know what you're up to, how we can support it, and then 
what you have identified as a problem that only we can fix.
    Secretary Fudge. Okay.
    Senator Schatz. And I'd like to just sort of project manage 
this together so we track the things that need to change within 
the agency and help you when you're doing rulemaking to 
consolidate things or when you're making procedural changes 
that don't require a rule under the Administrative Procedures 
Act. However it is I want us to sort this and track it and I 
want my staff to have a sort of shared spreadsheet, if you 
will, so we can work this together because I don't think this 
is a partisan question.
    We just want your agency to work better and I know you do, 
too.
    Secretary Fudge. I welcome it. I really do, and I would 
also say about tribal nations, the biggest problem we have is 
infrastructure.
    When you get into these rural communities, just think about 
how many reservations and tribal lands we have that have no 
running water, no plumbing. That should not happen in this 
America.
    So infrastructure is as big a problem as anything else 
because until we can get that infrastructure, we can't put the 
housing there that we need. I mean, you think about the fact 
that Native Americans report to the military at higher rates 
than--almost double any other group of people and we can't 
house them. It's a problem.
    Senator Schatz. And tens of thousands of Native families 
with no electricity in the United States of America in 2023.
    Secretary Fudge. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you.
    Chair Murray.
    Senator Murray. Well, thank you very much, Chair Schatz and 
Ranking Member Hyde-Smith, and I'm really glad to join both of 
you today as we continue full steam ahead to return to regular 
order and pass our funding bills in a timely bipartisan way.
    I know that families back in my home state of Washington 
and across the country are counting on us to work together to 
get our communities the resources that they need to grow and 
thrive and compete on the world stage.
    When it comes to keeping folks safe, setting families up 
for success, and strengthening our country, it really starts, 
as you well know, with making sure that everyone has a roof 
over their head and no one is left on the streets or out in the 
cold because it's all too common for families in every part of 
this country to be terrified about what will happen to them or 
their kids the moment they can't make rent or cover their 
mortgage.
    My home state of Washington, like so many, have been really 
grappling with our nation's housing and homelessness crisis for 
years and it has gotten worse, as you well know, in this 
pandemic.
    I've heard from people who have no place to stay, no idea 
how on earth they're ever going to afford rent or mortgage. 
I've heard from parents living paycheck to paycheck. They're 
scared they're going to have to skip meals or medical care to 
make rent or who are really frightened their family's going to 
end up on the street.
    I've met with a lot of community leaders who are fighting 
day and night to build more housing, make it more affordable, 
and connect these folks who are experiencing homelessness with 
the resources that they need.
    As I wrote to President Biden, we need a whole of 
government approach here and let's be clear whole of government 
includes this subcommittee. That's why I fought to make 
critical housing investments in our bipartisan funding package 
last year and I want to see us build on that progress with 
funding to tackle the root causes of this crisis and that means 
increasing the supply of quality housing and preserving our 
existing public housing, investing in under-resourced 
neighborhoods, incentivizing changes to the zone laws, rental 
assistance, assistance for first-time homebuyers.
    These are investments that pay off for our country in a lot 
of ways. They help families build wealth. They provide safety 
and stability so our kids can focus on school and adults can 
focus on their jobs and strengthen our families and our 
communities and our economy.
    So I really do look forward to working with the Chair and 
Ranking Member on this subcommittee to make sure we have the 
investments that we need to move ahead.
    Secretary Fudge, thank you for being here today. I wanted 
to ask you House Republicans have now proposed to cut non-
Defense discretionary programs to fiscal year 2022 levels.
    Can you talk with us about how those cuts would harm HUD's 
programs and your department's ability to increase the supply 
of affordable housing and reduce the cost of housing and people 
who are experiencing homelessness?
    Secretary Fudge. Yes, thank you very much, Senator.
    We do know that if we go to the 2022 levels we would lose 
approximately 350,000 vouchers. We would be short well over a 
billion dollars in renewing our project-based rental assistance 
contracts. That would be a loss of about 87,000 affordable 
units because we would not be able to meet our contract 
obligations.
    We would probably serve about 50,000+ people who are 
homeless--we would not be able to serve about 50,000 people who 
are homeless through our Continuums of Care Programs and just 
think about it this way.
    Things go up, you know. Rent goes up. We talked about 
inflation. Prices go up. If we can't meet at least the 
inflationary pressures of today, we lose out everywhere. People 
can't pay their rents because we can't afford to help them pay 
their rent.
    So we would have to not only lose all of these things that 
I just talked about, but we'd probably have a hiring freeze. 
We'd probably have to lay some people off because we received 
for the first time in many, many years a raise for some of our 
staff last year that we would not be able to maintain.
    We just can't function the way that we should because we 
would not have the resources to do it.
    Senator Murray. Well, I think it's really important that 
everybody recognize that we have a housing and a homelessness 
crisis not only in my state but across the country and everyone 
should understand how serious and devastating those kinds of 
cuts would be for the entire country.
    So I just want everybody to absorb that. We have a problem 
and we would not be addressing it if we go back to those.
    Secretary Fudge. I would also say this, that we have for 
decades and decades neglected public housing. We have not over 
the last few years been able to give them the kind of resources 
just to bring some of those properties up so that people can 
live decent lives. So each year we are putting more resources 
into that.
    The President's 2024 budget I think requests about three 
billion for capital improvements and eight billion overall and 
it's not enough. We could spend that much money in New York or 
L.A. What about the rest of the country?
    Senator Murray. So this is a serious challenge for all of 
us.
    I do have additional questions. I'll submit them for the 
record, but, Mr. Chairman, as I said, this subcommittee is 
critical as we move forward.
    So thank you.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Chair Murray.
    Thank you to all of the members. Secretary Fudge, thanks 
for coming today to discuss HUD's Budget Request.

                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    The hearing record will remain open until Friday, May 5th, 
to allow members to submit additional questions for the record.

              Questions Submitted by Senator Patty Murray
              
                   collaboration between hud and cms
                   
    Question. Washington state uses a Medicaid demonstration waiver to 
implement the Foundational Community Supports program. This program 
offers supportive housing to people on Medicaid who are struggling and 
helps them get stable housing and become self-sufficient. This 
collaborative approach between HUD and CMS is promising--and shows the 
value of aligning housing and healthcare dollars to provide effective 
solutions for people experiencing homelessness--particularly to address 
chronic homelessness.
    What capacity building and technical assistance is HUD providing to 
support these kinds of efforts and what resources are needed to improve 
this collaboration?
    Answer. HUD agrees that the growing number of states that are 
covering tenancy supports and other housing-related supportive services 
under their Medicaid programs for people with chronic health conditions 
who are transitioning from homelessness is highly promising. Many 
states like Washington are still in the early stages of implementation 
of these new Medicaid-financed housing-related services. For this 
reason, HUD has been working with the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) to provide more technical assistance (TA) and 
support to states to assist them to implement these new Medicaid 
services and to ensure that these services are coordinated with housing 
assistance.
    In partnership, HUD and HHS established the Housing and Services 
Resource Center (HSRC) to foster collaboration and cross-sector 
partnerships in order to streamline access to services, better leverage 
resources, and ultimately make community living possible for more 
people. Through this partnership, HUD is in the process of working with 
HHS to establish a joint TA engagement with some of the states that 
have received the Medicaid 1115 waiver. The goal of this engagement is 
to help states with their implementation plan and to ensure states are 
addressing homelessness and/or meeting the housing needs of populations 
who are at high risk of homelessness.
    Additionally, in July 2021, HUD began a 3-part webinar series 
titled ``Coordinating HHS Housing-Related Supports and Services with 
HUD Housing Assistance.'' The second webinar, held on August 12th, 
2021, focused on CMS-Medicaid Resources for Housing Supportive 
Services. The webinar provided a primer on Medicaid for housing 
providers, including homeless service providers and PHAs, including the 
services that could be paid for without a waiver or flexibilities, 
flexibilities that were provided as part of the American Rescue Plan, 
and information about the Medicaid demonstration waiver.
    Going forward, HUD intends to coordinate with the United States 
Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) on the implementation of 
All In: The Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness, 
which includes strategies to increase the use of Medicaid-funded 
services for those residing in permanent supportive housing and to 
increase the ability of communities to integrate data from HMIS with 
other administrative data, such as Medicaid, to inform planning and 
decisionmaking.

                   ehv program and stability vouchers
                   
    Question. HUD has included a number of flexibilities and incentives 
in the Emergency Housing Voucher Program and Stability Vouchers to 
expedite rehousing of people who are experiencing homelessness or at-
risk of experiencing homelessness, and increase leasing rates.
    What lessons has HUD learned in implementing these programs and is 
HUD considering extending any of these programmatic flexibilities to 
other voucher programs in order to increase the number of people who 
can use these services and improve program management?
    Answer. HUD has been pleased with the success of the Emergency 
Housing Voucher (EHV) program, and we believe that the program's 
innovations and incentives have been important to that success. 
Accordingly, HUD has taken several steps to introduce these innovations 
more broadly in the Housing Choice Voucher program.
    For instance, HUD expanded the uses of the HCV Program's 
Administrative Fees through PIH Notice 2022-18--Use of Housing Choice 
Voucher (HCV) and Mainstream Voucher Administrative Fees for Other 
Expenses to Assist Families to Lease Units. Given the number of tight 
and competitive rental markets around the country, the use of new 
strategies is increasingly becoming necessary to help families lease 
units. Building on the innovations applied in the EHV program and 
elsewhere, this notice authorizes Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) to use 
ongoing administrative fee funding to provide owner incentive/retention 
payments, security, and utility deposit assistance, assistance with the 
application or brokers' fees, holding fees, and renter's insurance if 
required by the lease.
    In addition, the President's budget includes a demonstration 
proposal to allow PHAs to use HCV Housing Assistance Payment Funding to 
assist tenants, in limited situations, with security deposits and other 
leasing-related costs. Low-income families with HCVs often struggle to 
identify units to lease because they have few financial resources and 
are unable to pay security deposits and utility deposits. HUD proposes 
appropriations language for a demonstration to allow PHAs to use a 
limited amount of Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) funding to assist 
HCV recipients with tenant leasing expenses such as security deposits, 
utility deposits, and where the last month's rent is required upfront. 
While PHAs are already allowed to use administrative fees for this 
purpose, this proposal would significantly expand the pool of resources 
available to PHAs to assist with such costs.
    The President's Budget also includes proposals to extend certain 
flexibilities that are currently available for EHVs and Veterans 
Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) vouchers to Mainstream 811, Family 
Unification, and Foster Youth Initiative (FYI) program vouchers.

                   service providers for homelessness
                   
    Question. Front-line staff play a vital role in our efforts to 
tackle homelessness--and the work that they do is tough. Supportive 
service providers continue to face high rates of turnover and burnout--
and these workforce challenges impact the success of our homelessness 
interventions.
    How can HUD better support recruitment and retention in the 
homelessness services workforce?
    Answer. HUD recognizes the importance of the work that front-line 
staff do for homelessness service providers across the country, and how 
necessary they are to reducing homelessness. Yet, it continues to be 
one of the lowest paying and least-supported jobs. Staff are also 
rarely trained to handle the depth of issues they encounter from those 
experiencing homelessness.
    HUD can support recruitment and retention of front-line staff in 
the homeless services workforce by continuing to encourage recipients 
to pay higher salaries to these staff and providing resources to 
support training and workforce development. HUD began this work during 
the COVID-19 pandemic by allowing Emergency Solutions Grants funds 
awarded through the CARES Act to pay for hazard pay and other workforce 
incentives necessary to prevent, prepare for, or respond to the COVID-
19 pandemic. Additionally, in the recent Special NOFO to Address 
Unsheltered and Rural Homelessness, HUD made available funds for 
capacity building to recipients operating projects in rural areas, 
where finding the necessary workforce was challenging even before the 
pandemic.
    Recently, Congress amended the statute for the Continuum of Care 
(CoC) Program to allow CoC Program grant funds in rural areas to 
support ``staff training, professional development, skill development, 
and staff retention activities.'' Implementation will permit CoC 
program recipients to use the funds to retain staff and provide 
training.
    The 2024 President's Budget requests that the CoC NOFO be adjusted 
to a two-year cycle. This provision will allow HUD to award CoC Program 
funds every other year instead of every year. Responding to an annual 
NOFO requires CoCs to spend many hours implementing a local competition 
process and additional time to complete the application. A two-year 
NOFO process would allow CoCs to focus more on strategic planning and 
performance evaluation to better prevent and end homelessness in their 
communities.
    Question. Should we look at ensuring services supported by Homeless 
Assistance Grants keep pace with the cost of living?
    Answer. Yes. Under the CoC Program there is authority to increase 
the budget line items within grants that are related to housing costs 
(i.e., rental assistance, leasing, and operating), but there is no 
authority to increase costs related to providing supportive services or 
carrying out administrative activities. As many of the grants awarded 
under the CoC Program have been operating for over 10 years, recipients 
are reporting that the funding they were originally awarded for 
supportive services is not nearly enough to continue carrying out the 
original level of services proposed in their initial grant. Providing 
authority to increase funding for supportive services and 
administrative costs relative to the cost of living is crucial to 
helping recipients provide a high level of supportive services 
necessary to assist people experiencing homelessness obtain and 
maintain housing and improve their well-being.

            Questions Submitted by Senator Dianne Feinstein
            
                           veteran disability
                           
    Question. Secretary Fudge, thank you for your continued 
collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs on the HUD-VA 
Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program, which provides permanent 
supportive housing to veterans experiencing homelessness. It is a 
critical tool in the effort to end veteran homelessness. Through the 
HUD-VASH program, HUD funds rental assistance through Section 8 
vouchers while VA provides case management and connection to services. 
HUD also sets the definition of Area Median Income (AMI) and determines 
the sources of income that are used to calculate AMI. The inclusion of 
veteran disability compensation in the AMI often results in veterans 
who live in high cost-of-living areas, like California, earning too 
much to qualify for Public Supportive Housing but earning too little to 
afford market-rate rents. HUD recently determined it will continue to 
include veteran disability compensation in AMI calculations, further 
exacerbating the housing challenges faced by many veterans.
    Secretary Fudge, please provide any statistics you have on the 
number of veterans that are disqualified from public supportive housing 
due to their AMI, and especially any statistics that shed light on the 
number of homeless that are ineligible because they receive veterans 
disability compensation.
    Answer. HUD bases Area Median family income calculations, and the 
income limits derived therefrom, on income data collected by the Census 
Bureau through the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS does not 
ask separately about the receipt of veterans' service disability 
payments. HUD does not have national data on how many veterans are not 
eligible for housing assistance because service disability payments 
raise their incomes above HUD Income Limits.
    Question. Will you further consult with the Treasury Department on 
the inclusion of veteran disability compensation in AMI calculations 
and seek ways to ensure that AMI limits do not result in veterans in 
high cost-of-living areas remaining homeless?
    Answer. Yes, HUD is actively working with the Department of 
Veterans Affairs and the Department of the Treasury to develop a 
solution to ensure that all homeless veterans have access to the 
affordable housing options they need.

                         women and homelessness

    Question. Secretary Fudge, over the years HUD has formally 
recognized specific subgroups in the overall homeless population who 
have unique needs and characteristics, like veterans, families, 
chronically unhoused, and youth. Such subpopulation designations bring 
increased awareness, research, tailored programs, and specific funding 
streams (i.e. youth set-asides in state homeless assistance dollars), 
which have effectively reduced homelessness amongst all groups.
    There is one important group that has not been added as a subgroup: 
women. In 2019, the Downtown Women's Center conducted a Women's Needs 
Assessment which found that roughly 41.3 percent of chronically 
homeless women in Los Angeles sleep most frequently on the streets and 
that these women are more likely to experience gender-based violence, 
including domestic violence, dating violence, human trafficking, and 
sexual assault. Living on the street only increases the probability of 
further assaults and trauma. Nationally, unaccompanied women constitute 
29 percent, or nearly 1-in-3 of all unhoused individual adults, for a 
total of 120,015 women. As women's homelessness nationally remained 
flat over the last 5 years, unaccompanied women's homelessness has 
increased by 20 percent.
    Secretary Fudge, why doesn't HUD recognize unaccompanied women as a 
subgroup?
    Answer. Homelessness is a tragedy for anyone and we have seen the 
unique challenges that arise for women experiencing homelessness. In 
2019, the California Policy Lab published Health Conditions Among 
Unsheltered Adults in the U.S., a study that looked at the health 
conditions of people in both sheltered and unsheltered situations. One 
of the key findings was: ``Health and behavioral healthcare needs, and 
experiences of abuse and trauma, are major factors in loss of housing 
among unsheltered people, most especially for unsheltered women.'' This 
reality that women are uniquely impacted by their homeless experience 
is important.
    Under the Biden Administration, there has been a significant drive 
to understand the impact of housing and homelessness on women. HUD 
routinely collects and reports data on women experiencing homelessness, 
and HUD recently worked with a variety of partners in a technical 
assistance effort, including people with lived homeless experience, 
advocates, researchers, and communities, to update how data is 
collected on gender. HUD is working with other national partners, 
including other Federal agencies, to improve access to services and 
programs when there is gender-based violence. Additionally, HUD is 
enforcing housing protections under the Violence Against Women Act, to 
help ensure that women who are gender-based violence survivors are not 
denied housing nor lose their housing because of the violence committed 
against them.
    HUD works with Continuums of Care and other partners to address the 
unique needs and characteristics of different populations in a number 
of ways. Programs specifically targeted to Youth, Veterans, and 
survivors of Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Human Trafficking 
are authorized by statute and receive dedicated technical assistance. 
In these and all of our other programs, HUD provides tools and ongoing 
technical assistance to support grantees in delivering services 
equitably and in accordance with the Fair Housing Act and other civil 
rights laws. HUD is committed to continue to work with the United 
States Interagency Council on Homelessness and other partners to 
appropriately lift up the needs of women experiencing homelessness and 
to support efforts to design solutions that meet their unique needs and 
characteristics and advance equity.

                             documentation

    Question. Secretary Fudge, as you know possession of a social 
security card is critical to helping individuals who are homeless, and 
lack of proper identification is detrimental to securing placement in a 
permanent supportive housing program. For low-income or homeless 
individuals who have lost their documents, identification requirements 
create a difficult barrier and can lead to delays or even missed 
opportunities. Some homeless individuals find it difficult to get 
replacement social security cards or other documentation from the 
Social Security Administration (SSA).
    Secretary Fudge, do you recognize the lack of documentation for 
homeless individuals as a problem and what are you doing to address it?
    Answer. HUD is doing all it can to make it easier to serve people 
experiencing homelessness with minimal documentation. For instance, 
HUD's Continuum of Care Program does not require people experiencing 
homelessness to provide identification to receive housing. However, HUD 
is also aware that communities are partnering with many organizations 
to address homelessness and some of the other entities do require that 
kind of documentation. HUD is working with partners to find solutions 
to ease the effort of documentation. This includes considering waivers 
for communities where needed. HUD is in current conversations with SSA 
to evaluate challenges and explore potential solutions to reduce the 
burden of data collection.

                  los angeles's inside safe initiative
                  
    Question. Secretary Fudge, as you know Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass 
declared a local emergency for homelessness and initiated a program 
called Inside Safe to promote long-term housing stability. The 
initiative has already cleaned up street encampments and provided 
housing for more than 4,000 individuals, but much work remains to be 
done.
    Secretary Fudge, will you commit to working with Mayor Bass and the 
City of Los Angeles on the Inside Safe initiative? What resources, if 
any, does HUD need to assist the City of Los Angeles and ensure that 
Inside Safe is successful?
    Answer. HUD has been working with Los Angeles to understand its 
challenges and provide support. HUD has provided comprehensive 
technical assistance to the Continuum of Care (CoC), which is working 
closely with the city. HUD convenes a regular call with the CoC, PHAs, 
City, and County to discuss solutions to barriers to housing people in 
Los Angeles. HUD provided technical assistance to the CoC as it worked 
through the wind-down of Project Roomkey. Many of those lessons learned 
are directly applicable to the Inside Safe initiative. HUD is ready and 
willing to assist the City of Los Angeles and the CoC in their efforts 
to safely address the shelter and housing needs identified through 
Inside Safe and other efforts in Los Angeles through more integrated 
multi-part TA. We would also note that HUD proposed an increase to TA 
in the FY2024 President's Budget, which will allow us to offer more 
robust support in place-based engagements similar to those taking place 
in Los Angeles.

                                 ______
                                 

               Questions Submitted by Senator Joe Manchin
                     
                     homeless families and children
                     
    Question. As you know, there are competing Federal definitions of 
``homeless.'' According to HUD, homelessness has substantially declined 
in West Virginia. However, during the 2021 school year, the West 
Virginia Department of Education identified more than 9,500 students 
who experienced homelessness. Families and children who stay 
temporarily with other people, or in motels, due lack of permanent 
housing are considered ``homeless'' by the U.S. Department of Education 
(DOEd), but not by HUD.
    How does this budget request specifically support children 
experiencing homelessness?
    Answer. HUD believes no one should experience homelessness, 
especially children. The homeless education data reported by the 
Department of Education (ED) differ from the data reported by HUD in 
several ways. One example is ED utilizes State Education Agency (SEA) 
data that includes children and youth sharing the housing of other 
people due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or a similar reason 
(often referred to as living in ``doubled-up'' arrangements or ``couch-
surfing''). The HUD definition of homeless does not include people in 
doubled-up or couch-surfing arrangements; as such, this population is 
not represented in HMIS data. Additionally, SEA data includes children 
staying in hotels or motels due to the lack of alternate, adequate 
accommodations. HMIS data includes people staying in hotels or motels 
only if those accommodations are subsidized through a homeless 
assistance program.
    In the 2020 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR) Part 2, in 
which estimates are for the 2019 reporting year (October 1, 2018--
September 30, 2019) and the 2020 reporting year (October 1, 2019--
September 30, 2020), HUD reported on unaccompanied youth served 
throughout the year by Continuums of Care (CoCs) for the first time. 
This information is critical to helping HUD and communities better 
understand homelessness, create strategies to prevent it, and, 
ultimately, to end it. The AHAR reported that in 2019 there were 
120,866 unaccompanied youth and in 2020 there were 93,404 unaccompanied 
youth served in shelters. ED's data from the 2018-19 school year 
reported 125,729 homeless students and 112,822 homeless students in the 
2019-20 school years. Despite the differences in how the data is 
reported, these datasets tell a joint picture that children and youth 
experiencing homelessness are being identified and served through our 
respective efforts.
    HUD has worked with communities to make great progress over the 
last several years and saw a decline in homeless families with children 
of roughly 5 percent each year culminating in a 36 percent reduction 
between 2010 and 2022. This outcome was a result of HUD's incentives 
that encouraged communities to adopt more effective practices and 
better coordination with partner agencies to better identify and serve 
children and youth as well as the targeted funding through the Youth 
Homeless Demonstration Program (YHDP) grants.
    HUD has been awarding YHDP grants since 2016. Those grants have 
facilitated greater coordination at the Federal and local level. HUD 
works with partner agencies in ED and the Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) to ensure that we are learning all that we can 
from these programs and promulgating best practices and working towards 
better coordination across the homeless response and other children and 
youth service systems. Most importantly, HUD is centering the voices of 
children and youth in this process. Youth who have experienced or are 
currently experiencing homelessness help shape the YHDP application 
process from priorities to actual application reviews. Every applicant 
is required to get approval for their projects from a local Youth 
Action Board made up of young people who have experienced homelessness. 
This current budget request continues this momentum by supporting 
communities through the Continuum of Care Program and funding 
additional YHDP grants.
    HUD is also working closely with other agencies to coordinate 
Federal resources. For example, HUD and HHS sent a joint message to 
communities in May 2023 to promote newly released funding for 
communities and organizations to build and expand housing and services 
for youth experiencing homelessness or housing instability.
    Question. Can you describe how HUD will work with other agencies, 
like DOEd and the Administration for Children and Families, to ensure 
we are providing the best services possible to children and youth 
experiencing homelessness?
    Answer. As described above, HUD is collaborating with its partner 
agencies to find ways to best serve children and youth. HUD is 
committed to working together and to sharing best practices with our 
respective recipients. As recently as May 22, 2023, HUD, HHS's Family 
and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB), and HHS's Administration for Children 
and Families (ACF) issued a joint message to promote newly released 
funding opportunities for communities and organizations to build and 
expand housing and services for youth experiencing homelessness or 
housing instability. This joint communication highlights HUD, FYSB, and 
HHS's Children's Bureau's shared belief in the importance of 
coordination and collaboration efforts across Federal, state, and local 
partners. Additionally, HUD is committed to providing technical 
assistance resources to ensure that recipients of HUD grants are aware 
of best practices in serving children and youth experiencing 
homelessness and that eligibility for HUD programs is clear and no 
child or youth experiencing homelessness is turned away from services 
due to confusion over the various definitions of homelessness.
                             
                             housing supply
                             
    Question. While overall inflation has dropped to its lowest level 
since May 2021, it is still frustratingly high and amounts to a tax on 
West Virginians that they notice every day. According to the Consumer 
Price Index (CPI), housing is the single largest contributor to 
inflation right now, offsetting the progress made in reducing prices 
across other sectors.
    What steps is HUD taking to increase housing supply and 
construction?
    Answer. The Department is committed to expanding the supply of 
high-quality affordable housing to meet the needs of households and 
communities nationwide. As an important component of the Biden-Harris 
Administration's Housing Supply Action plan, HUD has taken, or is 
exploring, numerous steps to increase the supply of affordable housing 
through the use of its programs. This includes:

  --Restarting the Federal Finance Bank's Risk Sharing program, which 
        provides low-interest loans to state and local housing finance 
        agencies.

  --Directing federally held housing supply to owner-occupants and 
        mission-driven entities instead of large investors.

  --Making it easier to finance new units and helping manufacturers 
        update their designs to meet changing consumer demands: This 
        includes working to increase the usability of FHA's Title I 
        loan program for Manufactured Housing, supporting greater 
        securitization of Title I loans through Ginnie Mae's platform, 
        updating the HUD Code to allow manufacturers to modernize and 
        expand their production lines, and helping manufacturers 
        respond to supply chain issues.

  --Enhancing the FHA 203(k) renovation loan program to increase its 
        usefulness in renovating single family homes to restore them to 
        productive use in communities across the country.

  --HUD will launch the $85 million Pathways to Removing Obstacles to 
        Housing (PRO Housing) competition soon, which supports 
        communities that are actively taking steps to remove barriers 
        to affordable housing caused by burdensome regulations or 
        procedures, gaps in available resources for development, 
        deteriorating or inadequate housing-related infrastructure, or 
        increasing threats from natural hazards.

  --Revising FHA's underwriting policies to permit the inclusion of 
        current or prospective rental income from accessory dwelling 
        units in an applicant's income when underwriting a borrower 
        seeking FHA-insured mortgage financing, which will both 
        increase the supply of ADUs and help more households access 
        homeownership and build wealth.

  --Treasury and HUD jointly published a `how to' guide to help 
        governments use American Rescue Plan funds with other sources 
        of Federal funding. Governments have committed billions of 
        their State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) resources 
        for affordable housing development.

  --HUD has pledged to pursue rulemaking to streamline the HOME 
        Investment Partnerships program, which is a critical resource 
        for the creation of affordable rental housing and 
        homeownership.

  --The Thriving Communities Technical Assistance program, funded in 
        FY22 with $5 million, is designed to support coordination and 
        integration of transportation and housing in infrastructure 
        planning and implementation. HUD is currently accepting 
        requests for technical assistance from local governments.

  --HUD has supported the Administration's Housing Supply Action Plan 
        through a number of actions, including programmatic 
        enhancements intended to increase multifamily housing 
        development, changes to FHA asset disposition programs to 
        direct homeownership assets to owner-occupant purchasers, and 
        policy changes to facilitate the construction and financing of 
        alternative housing such as manufactured homes and accessory 
        dwelling units. HUD also supported the Plan by significantly 
        updating key program guidance and trainings; these include an 
        updated ``Use of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds 
        in Support of Housing'' program Notice, the new ``Increasing 
        the Supply of Affordable Housing'' technical assistance website 
        and Affordable Housing Supply Toolkit, the Barriers to 
        Affordable Housing Webinar Series, and several other technical 
        assistance and program guidance products.

  --HUD will also launch the $225 million Preservation and Reinvestment 
        for Community Enhancement (CDBG-PRICE) competition soon, which 
        will preserve and revitalize manufactured housing communities 
        through infrastructure, planning, resident and community 
        services (including relocation assistance and eviction 
        prevention), resiliency activities, and other assistance to 
        residents or owners of manufactured homes.
    Question. What steps could Congress take to increase all forms of 
housing supply?
    Answer. There are numerous steps that Congress could take to 
increase the supply of housing. The President's fiscal year 2024 Budget 
included several legislative and funding proposals that would 
contribute to increased housing supply through HUD programs. These 
include:

  --Mandatory funding for new project-based rental assistance contracts 
        to increase the development of affordable rental and owner-
        occupied housing and to incentivize jurisdictions to remove 
        barriers to affordable housing developments;

  --Modernization of the FHA 203(k) renovation loan program;

  --Modernization and enhancement of the FHA Title I Manufactured 
        Housing and Property Improvement programs;

  --Preservation of PBRA rental units when transferring to higher-
        opportunity locations;

  --Support the President's Budget request for an increase in the 
        funding of the Federal government's largest affordable housing 
        production grant program, the HOME Investment Partnerships 
        Program;

  --Re-baselining of basic statutory mortgage limits for FHA 
        Multifamily programs;

  --Authorizing Ginnie Mae securitization of Housing Finance Agency 
        Risk Sharing loans;

  --Increase loan guarantee authority for the Section 108 Loan 
        Guarantee program so that jurisdictions can request low cost, 
        federally guaranteed financing for housing, infrastructure and 
        economic development activities, and authority for HUD to 
        finance the construction of new housing units in mixed-use 
        development projects; and

  --Expand and improve the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit; create a new 
        Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit to develop and renovate 1-4 unit 
        housing in distressed urban, suburban, and rural neighborhoods.

    Also, Congress should fully support the Housing Supply Action Plan 
and the President's 2024 Budget, including reauthorization and 
legislative reform for the HOME program. We would be happy to discuss 
any or all of these proposals and would welcome your support for them.

                          national debt limit
                          
    Question. As you may know, the Federal government is teetering on 
the edge of financial disaster. We are on the brink of breaching the 
debt limit, we are accumulating debt at an historic pace, and we are 
consistently encouraging reckless and wasteful spending driven in large 
part by a budget system that is broken. While we have a long way to go, 
I am encouraged that HUD's FY24 discretionary budget request is roughly 
1.6 percent more than FY23-enacted levels. I appreciate your effort to 
restrain spending increases, and hope other departments and agencies 
will follow suit.
    To accomplish the necessary reductions to our national debt and to 
reign in reckless spending, we will need an all-hands-on-deck approach 
across the government. Can you and the Department commit to working 
with the Committee on finding ways to get our fiscal house in order, 
while ensuring that essential programs, such as for homelessness and 
affordable housing, are sufficiently funded?
    Answer. This Administration is committed to fiscal responsibility 
and HUD strives to maximize the use and efficiency of taxpayer dollars. 
The Budget request reflects this while also accomplishing key goals 
like increasing the supply of affordable housing and expanding the 
number of vouchers available for those in need.
    In recent testimony to the House Appropriations Subcommittee, the 
Inspector General noted HUD has made significant strides in improving 
financial management. The agency has received clean audit opinions for 
three consecutive years. HUD continues to strengthen controls around 
its business processes in real-time, as possible, and has a number of 
formal mechanisms to address and mitigate risks in our operations.
    The President's Budget includes several proposals designed to 
improve HUD's efficiency and effectiveness. These include centralizing 
funding for inspections, strengthening risk management along with 
deploying current technologies, and enhanced business processes across 
our operations that would allow the agency to be agile in its 
responsiveness and a strong financial steward of public funds.

     state housing finance agencies and performance-based contract 
                             administrators
                             
    Question. State Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) have historically 
played an important role as Performance-Based Contract Administrators 
(PBCAs) overseeing our nation's affordable housing projects funded 
through the Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) program. As you 
know, PBRA provides critical affordable housing stock to low-income 
families across the country. There is concern that HUD could shift PBCA 
responsibility from state HFAs to regional authorities. This would harm 
states like West Virginia that have very specific needs best addressed 
by dedicated HFAs that understand the state. I am encouraged that HUD's 
FY24 Budget Request recognizes the important role of state HFAs in the 
PBRA program. However, I am concerned that HUD has left the door ajar 
for an eventual shift to a regional approach to administration.
    Could you explain how this Committee can ensure that State Housing 
Finance Agencies are able to continue vitally serving their communities 
and the Department as Performance-Based Contract Administrators?
    Answer. Existing PBCA contracts across the country are expiring, 
with contract extension periods running out within the next year. Due 
to the court's decision in CMA Contract Management Services et al. v. 
United States, HUD cannot extend the existing contracts beyond the 
limited number of short-term extensions remaining. Instead, absent 
legislative changes by Congress, HUD will need to procure contractors 
through a CICA/FAR compliant process that would not meet the needs of 
HUD, states, or PHAs. The only way to continue with a system similar to 
the current one is for Congress to provide legislation exempting HUD 
from the CICA/FAR process. HUD's proposal in the President's Budget 
reflects the extensive feedback received from many stakeholders, 
including bipartisan comments from members of Congress regarding HUD's 
proposed language. In addition to individual conversations, HUD 
recently held a group listening session with stakeholders to hear 
comments on the proposal. HUD would welcome the opportunity to work 
with the Committee on a legislative solution to resolve the PBCA issue.

   proposed rule changes for the home investment partnerships program
   
    Question. The HOME Investment Partnerships Program is HUD's 
flagship program, and the only Federal block grant, dedicated 
exclusively to producing affordable housing. HOME is also one of the 
main tools in providing Federal assistance to West Virginians. Housing 
agencies have indicated, however, that the regulations and conditions 
can be burdensome, which restricts the impact HOME funds can have. I 
understand HUD is developing new rules and regulations for the HOME 
program.
    How does HOME--and the upcoming proposed rule changes--play into 
the Administration's strategy to address the affordable housing crisis?
    Answer. The HOME program reform is a key deliverable of the 
President's Housing Supply Action Plan. HOME is a critical resource for 
acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of affordable rental and 
homeownership housing in communities across the country. For many 
localities, HOME is the only affordable housing resource available to 
them to address their affordable housing needs and priorities.
    The HOME program was authorized by Title II of the Cranston-
Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990. The Housing and 
Community Development Act of 1992 made changes to the HOME statute to 
streamline the program and has been the only reauthorization of the 
program. Despite the many innovations in affordable housing financing, 
the HOME statute has not been significantly changed in 31 years.
    The HOME statute itself helps create significant complexity for 
States and localities administering the HOME program because it is very 
detailed and prescriptive. The HOME program regulations must then 
implement these statutory requirements, so HUD is limited in its 
ability to substantially reform the program through rulemaking alone. 
HUD is currently developing a HOME proposed rule that, within these 
statutory confines, will identify unexercised flexibilities and help to 
streamline and modernize the program. The Department believes that 
modernization and streamlining of the HOME statute is necessary to 
ensure that HOME funds can be used more effectively in newer affordable 
housing delivery models and seamlessly with other public and private 
financing.
    Question. Can you provide the Committee with an update on where HUD 
is in this process of updating relevant rules and the impact they will 
have on states like West Virginia?
    Answer. The Department is currently developing the proposed HOME 
program rule. HUD cannot discuss the content of the rule before it is 
transmitted to the Hill for review before publication. As part of the 
rule development process, HUD is carefully considering the unique 
challenges faced by States as they address affordable housing needs in 
rural areas.
          
          legal conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac
          
    Question. Since the Global Financial Crisis, Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac have been in a legal conservatorship of the U.S. government. These 
government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) purchase mortgages on the 
secondary market, providing certainty and liquidity for the housing 
market. This legal conservatorship was intended to be a temporary 
measure to shore up confidence in the housing industry and to allow the 
GSEs to build up sufficient capital to prevent another subprime 
mortgage loan crisis. Despite the conservatorship succeeding in its two 
goals, subsequent administrations have never addressed the 
conservatorship's future.
    Has the Administration taken any position on the conservatorship?
    Answer. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are in their fourteenth year of 
conservatorship, and the Congress has not yet enacted legislation to 
define the GSEs' long-term role in the housing finance system. As noted 
in the 2024 Budget, the Administration is committed to housing finance 
policy that increases the supply of housing that is affordable for low- 
and moderate-income households, expands fair and equitable access to 
homeownership and affordable rental opportunities, protects taxpayers, 
and promotes financial stability. The Administration has a key role in 
shaping, and a key interest in the outcome of, housing finance reform, 
and stands ready to work with the Congress in support of these goals. 
Additional questions would be best directed to the entities with direct 
authority over the conservatorship.
    Question. Will you commit to working with Treasury to provide the 
Committee with information on policy options the Administration, or 
Congress, could consider?
    Answer. HUD will gladly assist in any way it can in providing 
information or input as requested.

                                 ______
                                 

          Questions Submitted by Senator Shelley Moore Capito
          
                 economically distressed rural counties
                 
    Question. In economically distressed rural counties, HUD programs 
are not always targeted well, because of the way that HUD measures 
incomes and deem eligibility. In these counties, where we find a 
concentration of low-income Americans, the area median incomes that HUD 
and other agencies use to set eligibility for their programs are very 
low because so many people in those counties are struggling to make 
ends meet. HUD collects and calculates this income data, and uses it to 
set program eligibility limits. Other agencies use these limits, like 
USDA, for their own programs.
    As far back as 2016, USDA recognized there was a problem with how 
low the HUD-produced income limits were in some rural places, and 
instituted something called income banding to try and make the limits 
work better. Americans seeking services in some rural communities in WV 
are told that they don't qualify as low-income, even though their 
family of four is living on $48,000 a year. But just over the border in 
neighboring rural Ohio, the same family would qualify as low-income 
easily.
    How long has HUD been aware of this problem?
    Answer. HUD's area Median Family Income calculations and the 
associated Income Limits are calculated in accordance with statute and 
are designed to designate the same proportion of households as eligible 
based on metropolitan area and non-metropolitan county estimates of 
median family income. In each state, HUD sets a floor on income limits 
derived from the median family income across all the nonmetropolitan 
counties of the state. In the case of West Virginia, there are counties 
where a family of four living on $48,000 per year is not considered to 
be low-income but that same family would be considered low-income in 
Ohio because of the relative levels of income in the two states. The 
area Median Family Income across non-metropolitan counties in West 
Virginia in HUD's FY 2023 income limits was $64,200. In Ohio, the 
commensurate measure of area Median Family Income is $79,500. 
Consequently, the lowest county-level low-income limit in West Virginia 
is $50,250 whereas in Ohio it is $62,700.
    Available data show that there is an urgent need for affordable 
housing and housing assistance throughout the country, across all types 
of communities. HUD tracks the share of households eligible for 
assistance through its Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy 
Data. These data are special tabulations of American Community Survey 
Data which apply HUD's Income Limits to Census tabulations to show both 
owner and renter populations by HUD's Income Limit categories. The most 
recent data shows that 27 percent of households in West Virginia would 
be considered very low income by HUD, while in Ohio the figure is 26 
percent. The average household income for a family receiving rental 
assistance from HUD is $16,000, well below the income limits in even 
the lowest income states. In West Virginia, the average household 
income for a family receiving rental assistance from HUD is $12,516; in 
Ohio, the same figure is $12,163.
    Question. What is HUD doing to ensure rural Americans in 
economically distressed communities do not have issues with 
unreasonably low-income limits?
    Answer. Within the calculation of Income Limits, HUD applies a 
``state non-metropolitan median family income adjustment'' which raises 
the 4-person Very Low-Income limit to be equal to 50 percent of the 
area Median Family Income calculated across all non-metropolitan 
counties in a state. For FY 2022 this means that any area in West 
Virginia where the actual area Median Family Income would generate a 4-
Person Very-Low Income limit less than $29,650, the calculated Median 
Family Income is raised to $29,650, subject to HUD's annual limits on 
income limit increases and decreases.
    HUD notes that the greatest barrier to a family receiving needed 
housing assistance is the limited available funding for that 
assistance. The Department remains committed to working with Congress 
on solutions to the nation's urgent need for affordable housing.
    Question. Will HUD work with my office to provide technical 
assistance on legislation to revise the state floor to be extended to 
include a national floor?
    Answer. HUD regularly works with members of the House and Senate on 
technical drafting service (TDS) requests. We would be happy to provide 
our data and research expertise through the TDS process.

               impact of area median income calculations

    Question. Last year's Appropriations bill included report language 
that directs HUD to report on the impacts of using new proposed Area 
Median Income (AMI) calculations to account for poorer, rural states 
which lower Area Media Income calculations statewide in turn lessening 
the eligibility of certain areas to receive Federal assistance for 
housing. In urban areas, 30.4 percent of the population qualifies as 
``low-income'' whereas in rural areas only 16.3 percent of the 
population does.
    Has HUD begun working on this report?
    Answer. Yes, HUD has begun working on the report. The report will 
be based on the recently released FY 2023 Income limits, which were 
delayed this year due to anomalies in Census data caused by the 
pandemic. HUD is in the process of quantifying the increase in rent for 
low-income households that would result from raising income limits in 
the lowest income states.
    Question. If so, where is HUD in the process of compiling this 
report?
    Answer. HUD is still in the analysis phase of compiling information 
to provide in the report. As part of compiling the necessary data, HUD 
notes that by setting income limits based on local estimates of median 
family income, HUD ensures that similar shares of households are 
classified as low-income regardless of the area's state median family 
income. Nationally, about 27 percent of households are classified as 
very low-income based on HUD's income limits in 2019, the latest year 
for which data are available. This figure is the same for both 
metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. The share is also 27 
percent for both counties served by the Appalachian Regional Commission 
and non-Appalachian counties.
   
   hud economic development initiatives (edis) cds projects in west

    Question. Prior to the hearing, my office received an update on 
FY22 and 23 HUD Economic Development Initiatives (EDIs) CDS projects in 
West Virginia. Thank you very much for compiling and sharing that 
information. I am concerned about the lack of funding that has been 
awarded, in particular the FY22 projects. I understand it is a 
difficult account that lacks a direct purpose and authorization unlike 
other CDS accounts.
    Will HUD continue to work with my office to keep us informed of 
when funding is being released to recipients in the state?
    Answer. Yes, HUD is committed to keeping your office informed 
regarding Community Project Funds/Congressional Directed Spending (CPF/
CDS) awards in West Virginia. Through the Department's Office of the 
Chief Financial Officer, Appropriations Liaison Division, the program 
provides the Senate Appropriations Committee reports of executed CPF/
CDS grant agreements on a regular basis. Please reach out to HUD's 
Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations if you have 
questions for HUD's Office of Economic Development regarding the status 
of pending CPF/CDS awards for West Virginia. Thank you for the 
opportunity to keep you updated regarding how these projects are 
creating economic opportunities within your state.

    Question. Secretary Fudge, as companies work to serve the Ginnie 
and FHA markets, would you agree that it is important for Ginnie, FHA 
and HUD to provide clear and consistent guidelines in terms of when an 
institution should qualify to be approved as well as clarify with 
companies why they may have fallen short of HUDs standards?
    Answer. HUD agrees that it is important to provide clear and 
consistent approval guidelines for FHA and Ginnie Mae. Both agencies 
provide extensive information regarding eligibility guidelines and 
approval requirements and offer clear explanations in instances in 
which requests for approval are denied. If you are aware of specific 
instances in which this has not occurred, please let us know so that we 
can investigate further.

                       herschel lashkowitz tower
                       
    Question. We have been working with the City of Fargo and the Fargo 
Public Housing Authority to secure funding to demolish and redevelop a 
HUD housing facility called the Herschel Lashkowitz Tower. The 
Lashkowitz tower was built over 50 years ago by the Federal government, 
and has 200 residential units, making it the largest residential 
building in North Dakota. However, the building is badly outdated and 
needs to be replaced. Last November, the North Dakota Industrial 
Commission (NDIC) awarded $3.4 million in Federal funding for this 
project, which was made available under HUD's Housing Trust Fund, which 
provides funding to states for affordable housing development. At the 
same time, we have been working to secure additional funding for 
asbestos mitigation and clean-up through the Environmental Protection 
Agency's Brownfields Cleanup Grants program. The grants are expected to 
be awarded in the coming weeks, and I want to once again express the 
importance of this project for low-income families in the Fargo area.
    Will you and your team continue to work with my office and state 
and local officials to move this project forward?
    Answer. Yes, HUD will continue to work with all parties.
    
               public housing authorities in rural areas
               
    Question. North Dakota has 32 Public Housing Authorities serving 
29,000 North Dakotans in 12,000 households. As North Dakota is a very 
rural state, some of our Housing Authorities serve areas over 7,000 
square miles large.
    What type of assistance does HUD provide for Public Housing 
Authorities located in rural areas to help with capacity building, 
technical assistance, and training?
    Answer. The Office of Field Operations has contracted technical 
assistance and training that can be provided to PHAs on topics ranging 
from increasing public housing occupancy, improving physical 
conditions, PHA governance and HCV utilization. If a PHA requests or a 
field office sees a need, technical assistance can also be tailored to 
fit a PHA's needs.
    An example of TA provided previously is:

  --In 2022, Rolette, North Central (Ramsey), and Towner PHAs, each 
        received technical assistance from HUD's Denver Field Office 
        through a Multi-Agency Support Contract. These PHAs received 
        five half-day training sessions on assorted topics followed by 
        bi-weekly or monthly one-on-one sessions with each PHA. The 
        assistance was aimed at offering training and technical support 
        across various program areas including both Housing Choice 
        Voucher and Public Housing.

  --Fargo Housing and Redevelopment Authority (FHRA) also received 
        direct technical assistance through a Support Contract to 
        assist the PHA with agency capacity and struggling occupancy, 
        and to develop a strategy to manage an aging public housing 
        stock. The Denver Field Office assisted the (FHRA) with a 
        disposition action of the Lashkowitz Tower property in early 
        2020. In July 2022, after many discussions with HUD subject 
        matter experts, FHRA modified their application to include 
        demolition due to pervasive amounts of asbestos and other 
        hazardous materials.

  --All North Dakota PHAs have been regularly attending the MAP Network 
        quarterly Program Update Calls, which serve as a platform for 
        exchanging information and receiving guidance. These calls 
        ensure that the PHAs stay updated on important program 
        developments.

  --Overall, the Denver Field Office has been actively engaged in 
        providing technical assistance and training opportunities to 
        the PHAs in North Dakota. Each PHA in North Dakota is assigned 
        a Portfolio Management Specialist, an Engineer, and a Financial 
        Analyst from HUD's Denver Field Office. This team is 
        responsible for monitoring, coaching, and communicating with 
        each of the PHAs in North Dakota, establishing touchpoints on a 
        regular basis, often weekly if not monthly. These communication 
        channels serve as crucial opportunities for PHAs to interact 
        directly with their partners at HUD, enabling them to ask 
        critical questions, seek feedback, and gain valuable knowledge. 
        By engaging in this ongoing dialogue, PHAs in North Dakota can 
        stay informed about the latest updates, policies, and best 
        practices, ensuring a collaborative and supportive relationship 
        between the PHAs and HUD. This consistent communication further 
        strengthens the partnership, fosters a mutual understanding, 
        and enhances the PHAs' ability to effectively serve their 
        communities and fulfill their stated mission.
        
   housing and urban development veterans affairs supportive housing 
                               (hud-vash)
                                 
    Question. Housing and Urban Development Veterans Affairs Supportive 
Housing (HUD-VASH) is an important program that combines HUD's Housing 
Choice Voucher rental assistance with VA's case management and clinical 
services in order to assist veterans experiencing homelessness. The 
fiscal year 2024 budget request did not include new funding for this 
program because previously appropriated funds remain available.
    Why haven't previously appropriated funds been expended?
    Answer. HUD continues to make all appropriated HUD-VASH funds 
available under the HUD-VASH registration of interest notice process, 
which allows PHAs and partnering Veteran Affairs Medical Centers 
(VAMCs) the opportunity to self-identify interest in receiving 
vouchers. In 2023, HUD is giving PHAs two separate opportunities to 
register interest for all available HUD-VASH vouchers and funding--the 
first of these, Notice PIH 2023-09, was published in April.
    During the FY 2021 Registration of Interest, fewer PHAs self-
identified interest in receiving a HUD-VASH voucher allocation. Many 
PHAs are working to improve the utilization of their existing program 
before coming in for additional vouchers. There is also a lack of 
administrative capacity among some PHAs. HUD and VA are working 
collaboratively to assist PHAs and VAMCs to improve utilization.
    Question. Does HUD have enough resources to ensure that veterans 
experiencing homelessness who are eligible for this program will be 
able to access its services?
    Answer. HUD believes that there are sufficient HUD-VASH voucher 
resources to serve the current eligible population of homeless 
veterans. HUD notes that this may change in the future due to expansion 
of HUD-VASH eligibility or if veterans are not prevented from becoming 
newly homeless in the future.

              Questions Submitted by Senator John Boozman
              
                proposed community reinvestment act rule
                
    Question. As drafted, the proposed Community Reinvestment Act rule 
issued by the OCC, Federal Reserve, and FDIC, could be interpreted to 
penalize banks that purchase seasoned government-backed loans such as 
those under HUD's FHA and Section 184 Indian Home Loan Guarantee 
programs.? More specifically, the borrower distribution metric is 
unclear on how it would treat the purchase of a loan to a borrower who 
was considered LMI at the time the loan was originated, but for whom 
the bank does not have updated borrower income information at the time 
of purchase.? Because the borrower distribution metric measures the 
number of purchased and originated home mortgage loans to LMI borrowers 
as compared to all of the bank's purchased and originated home mortgage 
loans, to include purchased, government-backed loans without any 
updated income information in the borrower distribution metric will 
artificially suppress CRA ratings.
    To what extent do you believe this interpretation of the proposed 
rule would drive banks away from participating in government loan 
programs, like the FHA and Section 184 programs, and the Ginnie Mae 
system?
    Answer. HUD appreciates the Senator's interest in the potential 
impact of the proposed Community Reinvestment Act rule on its programs. 
The Department is unable, however, to estimate the prospective impact 
of this proposed rule on lender participation in its programs.
    Question. Do you agree that dissuading banks from participating in 
these programs could result in unintended consequences for borrowers 
who rely on FHA and Section 184 loan programs??
    Answer. HUD welcomes the participation of all interested and 
qualified lenders in its programs and is unable to estimate the 
prospective impact of this proposed rule on lender participation in its 
programs.
    Question. Would you support excluding purchased, seasoned, 
government-backed loans without any income information reported from 
the borrower distribution metric in the final CRA rule?
    Answer. HUD does not have an opinion on this matter.
    
                       fha multifamily production
                       
    Question. Over the past 2 years, FHA's multifamily production 
volume has dropped dramatically from over 140 closings per month to 
less than 60. HUD's own `Fiscal Year 2022-2026 HUD Strategic Plan' has 
a goal to `Increase the Supply of Housing'.
    With rising interest rates and reduced liquidity across the banking 
sector, what steps are being taken by FHA to reverse the trend on 
multifamily housing and help HUD to deliver on its Strategic Plan goal 
of increasing the supply of housing?
    Answer. The Department is committed to expanding the supply of 
high-quality rental housing to meet the needs of people and communities 
nationwide. FHA's Multifamily mortgage insurance programs are an 
essential part of that effort that we have worked to strengthen since 
the start of the Administration.
    FHA Multifamily experienced record program volume in FY 2020, 2021, 
and 2022, with $21.4 billion, $31.3 billion, and $22.7 billion, 
respectively, in firm commitments. In the preceding 10-year period from 
FY 2010 through FY 2019, volume ranged from $10.6 billion to a high in 
2013 of $17.8 billion. Like all mortgage finance sectors, multifamily 
financing is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. As interest rates 
have risen, it has become more challenging to make projects pencil out, 
leading to a decline in multifamily loan production across all 
financing channels in the market. As the market adjusts to a new normal 
in terms of mortgage interest rates, Multifamily will continue to 
support the supply of rental housing through its efficient & effective 
delivery of Multifamily mortgage insurance. In addition, the FY 2024 
President's Budget includes a legislative proposal that would permit 
HUD to update the statutory loan limits for the program, which would 
ensure FHA remains a viable financing option across a variety of 
markets.

                      housing for older americans
                      
    Question. Housing for older Americans has never been more important 
as we are at peak retirement for Baby Boomers. HUD's section 232 
program provides Mortgage Insurance for Residential Care Facilities.
    What is HUD doing to update this important program and make sure it 
meets the needs of our aging population? For example, are there 
thoughts of moving the age to 55 (to conform with the Fair Housing Act 
definition of Housing for Older Persons) or making it easier for 
nursing homes to qualify?
    Answer. HUD continuously strives to improve this extremely 
important and widely used residential care facility financing tool. As 
you have indicated, the statutory definition of ``elderly'' that 
applies to Section 232 assisted living facilities (ALFs) is limited to 
a person who is at least 62 years of age. Presently, HUD is sometimes 
able to insure ALFs with younger residents by utilizing Section 232's 
statutory definition for a Board and Care Home. Doing so is case-
specific and is constrained by other Board and Care Home statutory 
constraints. HUD is assessing the impacts of its statutory authority 
under the 232 program and whether changes that serve broader segments 
of older adults may be merited.

                                  gnma
                                  
    Question. The 2024 President's Budget requests $61.5 million for 
Ginnie Mae, which is $20.6 million more than the 2023 enacted level. I 
understand that 2024 will be the first year that Ginnie Mae transitions 
to support the entire cost for personnel services strictly from an 
annual appropriation.
    Can you share with the committee how this budget will enable Ginnie 
Mae to better achieve its mission to provide liquidity in the housing 
finance ecosystem?
    Answer. The budget request for Ginnie Mae's Salaries & Expenses 
($61 million) will support 271 full-time equivalents (FTEs), and 
provide necessary resources for Ginnie Mae to continue building on 
recent successes in driving liquidity toward equitable and affordable 
housing, including but not limited to:

  --Further investing in the Home Equity Conversion Mortgages 
        (``HECMs'') MBS Program. The HECM MBS program provides 
        liquidity benefits for senior citizens who depend on this 
        product to access equity in their homes. The budget ensures 
        that Ginnie Mae can implement programmatic improvements to 
        continue to support Issuer liquidity and the long-term health 
        of this product/program.

    It is important to note that a significant increase in the 2024 
budget request is the result of additional staffing needs related to 
the default of a large HECM MBS Issuer in December 2022 (FY 2023). Upon 
default, Ginnie Mae assumed the obligations for ongoing management and 
operation of the defaulted portfolio ( $21 billion). A significant 
surge in staffing is needed to manage the daily requirements of this 
sizeable and complex portfolio.

  --Optimize investment strategies that align with the HUD 2022-2026 
        Strategic Plan. The Plan explicitly directs Ginnie Mae to 
        pursue providing additional liquidity support to underserved 
        communities. This will entail the creation of new security 
        products and delivery structures (e.g., conversion of 
        multifamily risk share lending to Ginnie Mae securitization; 
        Title I lending; developing a business channel and 
        securitization product to enhance liquidity for Community 
        Development Financial Institutions, etc.). For FY 2024, 
        continued progress will be dependent on funding to deploy 
        dedicated FTE resources to support these initiatives.

  --Expanding our existing Digital Collateral program. In FY 2022, 
        Ginnie Mae increased Issuer participation opportunities by 
        reopening the program to new eIssuer applications. Since 
        reopening in June 2022, Ginnie Mae has processed over 20 
        eIssuers after completing risk assessments and system testing 
        for each. This effort has re-engineered requirements for the 
        management of pool collateral, including facilitating the 
        conversion from paper-based to a digital approach, which 
        requires additional staffing resources.

  --Enhancing our MBS program and platform through IT initiatives. In 
        executing these initiatives, Ginnie Mae takes advantage of 
        cloud migration. This enhancement of technology transformation 
        ensures that Ginnie Mae's MBS platform remains competitive and 
        agile in the dynamic secondary mortgage industry.

  --Mitigating major cyber and counterparty credit risks. The scale of 
        the MBS platform necessitates continued investment over 
        multiple years. In October 2022 (FY 2023), Ginnie Mae completed 
        migration of its securitization platform to Amazon Web Services 
        (AWS) GovCloud. With this migration, Ginnie Mae has the 
        foundational architecture to provide enhanced visibility into 
        our security operations and enable compliance with current/
        future risk requirements mandated by the government (e.g., 
        Executive Order 14028). In addition, Ginnie Mae continues to 
        make strides in data and analytics, but deficiencies exist 
        within legacy tools/systems.
        
              firsthome down payment assistance initiative
              
    Question. You have requested $100 million for the First Home Down 
payment Assistance initiative. Homeownership is a proven method of 
building wealth but obtaining the resources to meet required down 
payment and closing costs is the most significant obstacle to 
homeownership for potential first-time homebuyers who could otherwise 
afford the monthly costs of owning a home. The proposed set-aside 
within the HOME account aims to support sustainable homeownership among 
first-generation, first-time homebuyers while piloting programmatic 
flexibilities and innovations in subsidy delivery.
    Would this initiative help participating borrowers achieve greater 
equity in their homes at the time of closing?
    Answer. Yes. The purpose of the FirstHOME Downpayment Assistance 
(DPA) initiative is to provide downpayment assistance to first-time, 
first-generation homebuyers (i.e., homebuyers who have not owned a home 
and whose parents do not own a home). The purpose of the initiative is 
to help participating homebuyers achieve a 10 percent equity stake, 
through homebuyer downpayment, sweat equity, the FirstHOME DPA, or 
other assistance, in their home at the time of closing.
    Question. How would it reduce the likelihood of default and 
foreclosure?
    Answer. First HOME DPA will seek to combine upfront assistance to 
attain a 10 percent equity stake with other tools such as HUD-approved 
homebuyer counseling before purchase to ensure that first-time, first-
generation homebuyers achieve homeownership that is sustainable. 
Research suggests that a higher level of homebuyer equity and first 
mortgage debt that meets industry standards are correlated with lower 
rates of default.
    The FirstHOME DPA initiative will be administered by state HOME 
grantees, which in most states is the state housing finance agency. HUD 
will encourage these state grantees to combine FirstHOME DPA with other 
resources such as first mortgage financing provided through state-
funded mortgage products, community development financial institution 
(CDFI) and other community lender mortgage products, and FHA-insured 
products.
    Question. Under this initiative, who determines issues such as the 
type of housing product, the location of the affordable housing, and 
the segment of their low-income population to be served through the 
housing investment?
    Answer. State HOME grantees would design and administer FirstHOME 
DPA programs under flexible rules that encourage pilots and 
demonstrations of new approaches to serving low-and moderate-income 
first-time homebuyers who are also first-generation homebuyers. As in 
the main HOME Program, the grantee would determine the type of housing 
that may be acquired with FirstHOME DPA and establish eligibility and 
other rules for its program. Each state grantee would administer the 
program statewide.

                            fha's it systems
                            
    Question. FHA Catalyst is a crucial project to help provide cloud-
based platforms to reduce costs, risk, and fraud, and bring FHA in line 
with current industry practices. I support the enhanced level of 
resources provided in recent years to HUD's Cybersecurity and 
Information Technology Fund to help the agency better meet its acute 
information technology (IT) needs on a broad basis, including 
multifamily housing IT modernization and the ongoing upgrade of FHA's 
decades-old single-family IT infrastructure.
    How would you characterize the current state of FHA's IT systems?
    Answer. HUD has completed a number of improvements to date under 
the Housing IT Modernization Initiative, the bulk of which have 
occurred as components of the FHA Catalyst program. In 2020, HUD 
implemented the FHA Catalyst Case Binder and Claims Modules, which 
allow FHA lenders to submit case binders and claims electronically. 
Previously, HUD maintained paper-based processes that made it difficult 
for FHA partners to conduct business with FHA. In 2021, HUD delivered 
the FHA Catalyst Single Family Default Monitoring System, which 
provides FHA with a modern interface for tracking data on Defaulted 
Mortgages. This allows HUD to better understand which loss mitigation 
policies are being utilized to help delinquent borrowers remain in 
their homes, and to develop more effective policies to support 
borrowers and lenders.
    HUD remains committed to modernizing FHA's IT infrastructure and we 
are currently in the process of updating the roadmap for the Housing IT 
Modernization Initiative, which will articulate the strategies and 
prioritization that will guide HUD's next steps in IT modernization. 
This modernization of FHA's information technology will streamline 
processes for stakeholders and staff and improve analytical 
capabilities and internal controls.
    Question. What more can be done to help FHA improve its quality 
assurance controls and the integrity of its systems?
    Answer. Completion of the Office of Housing's comprehensive IT 
modernization requires Congressional support for continued 
appropriations and such resources are requested in the 2024 President's 
Budget for the Information Technology Fund in the amount of $3.3 
million. While the Department is very proud of the progress made to 
date, it will take additional resources to complete the work to 
properly modernize FHA's technology. We look forward to working with 
Congress as we collectively seek to finish the job of providing the 
trillion dollar FHA program the resources it needs to operate 
responsibly and efficiently in a 21st century mortgage finance 
environment.

                  small balance mortgage demonstration
                  
    Question. Your budget request includes a $15 million set-aside to 
finance the new Small Balance Mortgage demonstration, which will help 
increase access for mortgages for lower-priced, affordable homes.
    How will this demonstration program examine how to streamline 
regulations to make the small dollar mortgage market more efficient and 
accessible? This would represent a key step forward for potential home 
buyers.
    Answer. HUD's research has indicated that the primary barrier to 
the origination of small balance mortgage loans is the limited 
compensation lenders can earn from these transactions. While mortgage 
origination costs are largely fixed, lender compensation is variable 
based upon loan size. HUD's proposed small balance mortgage pilot will 
allow us to test whether small incentives that help to address lender 
profitability concerns will prompt them to increase the number of small 
balance mortgages originated in FHA programs. We are hopeful that the 
program may incentivize some lenders to establish the requisite 
strategy and infrastructure to originate these loans at scale with or 
without subsidy.
