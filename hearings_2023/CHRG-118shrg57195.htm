                                       U.S. Senate,
          Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met at 10 a.m., in room 538, Dirksen Senate 
Office Building, Hon. Sherrod Brown, Chair of the Committee, 
presiding.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIR SHERROD BROWN

    Chair Brown. The Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Committee will come to order. Welcome back, Chair Powell. Nice 
to see you, at least twice a year.
    For the economy to truly deliver security and opportunity 
for American workers, we need plentiful job opportunities, we 
need high wages, and we need low prices. Prices are the current 
problem, but it has been decades since workers have had all 
three at once.
    No matter what goes wrong in the economy--whether it is a 
financial crisis or bank failures, whether it is supply chain 
turmoil or energy market disruption--working people always pay 
the price.
    Meanwhile, corporations somehow always find a way to 
increase their profits. They always find a way. Financial 
crisis? Profits go up. Mass unemployment? Profits go up. Global 
pandemic? Profits go up. War in Europe? Profits go up. 
Increasing energy costs? Profits go up.
    When supply chains ground to a halt and Putin invaded 
Ukraine and the economy reopened and demand surged everywhere, 
all at once, the rest of us saw problems to solve. But in many 
corporate boardrooms, executives instead saw an opportunity. 
For the largest multinational corporations, inflation has been 
a perfect excuse to increase profits by raising prices far 
beyond the costs of their inputs.
    And the main tool that many in this town look toward to 
rescue us from inflation--hiking interest rates--can do little 
to solve that problem.
    It is little wonder, then, that when American workers see 
the high prices at the grocery store and the pharmacy counter 
and the gas pump, along with rising borrowing cost for 
mortgages and car loans and credit cards, they remain skeptical 
of Government and its willingness to address the challenges 
people face.
    Inflation, of course, is a complex problem, and the Fed has 
been fighting it with a blunt tool. And we have made progress. 
Inflation is at the lowest level in the last few years, giving 
hope that the price of consumer goods will continue to decline.
    And despite the experts' predictions, job growth remains 
strong. The country added 339,000 new jobs in May. Ohio's 
unemployment rate, 3.6 percent, is the State's lowest in 20 
years. Unemployment for Black and Brown Americans remains near 
historic lows.
    Think about what that actually means for workers in Alabama 
and Ohio and North Dakota and Louisiana and Minnesota and South 
Carolina, what that actually means for workers all over the 
country. It means Americans have more opportunity and choice in 
in their lives, even in places that have not seen a lot of 
options in recent years. It means people have the power to 
demand raises, and retirement security, and paid sick days, and 
control over their schedules. It means more Americans have the 
dignity of work that comes with a good job that provides for 
your family.
    And look where that kind of power for workers is taking us. 
Last month, wage growth outpaced inflation. That is the way it 
should be.
    Today's hearing comes at a critical time. Last week, the 
Fed decided to pause interest rates hikes after ten consecutive 
increases, and to maintain the rate at its current level. For 
the many of us who are concerned that further rate hikes could 
do more harm than good, this is welcome news.
    The challenge you face, Chair Powell, is to ensure that 
workers continue to see higher wages, while also continuing to 
rein in inflation.
    In previous hearings, you have noted, with justifiable 
pride, how careful management of the economy helped millions of 
workers return to the job market. It is those workers who stand 
to lose the most if the Fed overdoes its rate hikes, loses 
sight of the dual mandate, and drives the unemployment rate 
back up.
    As you have also noted, Mr. Chair, increasing interest 
rates is not the only tool we have to fight inflation, and the 
Fed is not the only one with a role to play. Congress, the 
Administration, everyone in Government, and in corporate board 
rooms, must do their part. There is no reason we cannot 
continue coming together to bring prices down.
    More policymakers are finally recognizing what those of us 
in Ohio have known for years, that outsourcing the production 
of pretty much everything may mean higher profits in the short 
term, but it will not lead to a resilient economy with a strong 
middle class in the long term.
    We have taken steps to strengthen our supply chains and 
bring critical manufacturing back to the U.S., with the CHIPS 
Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, a number of things. 
We must continue that progress.
    Instead of lowering demand--which is just economics 
textbook jargon for making people poorer, laying off workers, 
denying raises--instead of lowering demand we can produce more, 
we can build more, and we can grow the economy from the middle 
out.
    This is also our first semiannual report from the Fed since 
the string of bank failures this spring. Those failures were 
caused by the same issue at the heart of so many of our 
economic problems: it is the Wall Street business model. 
Executives lay off workers, they put short-term increases in 
quarterly profits--and their own compensation--above everything 
and everyone else.
    At Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, those in charge 
pushed their banks to grow too big, too fast. They made risky 
bets. And they got massive payouts--executives were paying 
themselves bonuses right up until the moment that at least one 
of these banks crashed.
    To most Americans, that is not surprising.
    People have gotten all too used to big bankers treating the 
industry more like a game, or, more precisely, an endless ATM 
for themselves, secure in the knowledge they will not pay any 
real price if things go wrong. Mr. Chairman, Senator Scott and 
I teamed up on a 21-2 vote yesterday. Those days for banking 
executives are over.
    Chair Powell, I look forward to hearing today how the Fed 
will protect American workers in the fight against inflation, 
and promote an economy with a strong, growing middle class.
    Senator Scott.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TIM SCOTT

    Senator Scott. Thank you, Chairman. Chair Powell, thanks 
for joining us today, such an important time. Your last 
appearance before this Committee was about 4 months ago, just 
days before the collapse of two banks. And while we continue to 
investigate those bank failures, it is important to examine the 
macro factors, such as rising interest rates, that contributed 
to the bank failures and the current economic stresses American 
families face every single day.
    Looking through the lens, I want to turn to you in your 
role as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, a role that requires 
constant scrutiny because the American people deserve nothing 
less than the best we can offer them: the greatest opportunity 
to succeed, and the strongest tools to pave their path.
    Unfortunately, the bank failures earlier this year shook 
confidence in our financial system, but thankfully, our healthy 
and well-managed institutions stepped up and we have been able 
to weather the storm. However, I have been consistently 
disappointed in your deputy, Vice Chair of Supervision, Michael 
Barr. Just yesterday, this Committee passed, as Chairman Brown 
just said, near-unanimous legislation to encourage good 
corporate governance. But not just that. We also wanted to 
focus on the supervisory failure that was a part of the 
legislation.
    Those are not the same actions taken by Michael Barr. I 
asked him twice when he was here before the Committee if he 
would fire bad bank supervisors for the supervisory neglect 
that contributed to the epic failures of SVB and Signature. He 
would not commit to doing anything. And I would ask you, in 
your role as the ``active executive officer,'' if you would 
take some action, firing those responsible for missing what was 
glaringly obvious, known to all of America, certainly should 
have been obvious to the supervisors.
    I have said from the beginning that this has been a failure 
in three parts, the SVB and Signature. It was a failure of the 
bank execs. The actions that we took 21 to 2 yesterday, 
reinforces Congress is willing to take the lead and hold bank 
executives accountable.
    Second failure was a supervisory failure, and that requires 
the Fed to hold folks accountable, just like Congress did. And 
third, the Biden inflationary economy that has drove prices 
really high and resulted in ten rate increases from you all.
    In the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's downfall, as the Vice 
Chair released his report on the failures, we heard directly 
from you that your role was to ``announce it,'' to ``get 
briefed on it,'' but not necessarily to be ``involved in the 
work of it.''
    So my question is, as you watch Vice Chair Barr roll out 
higher capital standards, it seems like your very clear 
statements is that you will be supporting as well as working to 
implement Vice Chair Barr's recommendations. But as you know, 
the other members of the board and Governor Bowman has recently 
said that Mr. Barr wrote a report on Silicon Valley Bank's 
failure that provided ``his conclusions'' and went on to state 
that the report should be used ``to help guide discussions 
among policymakers,'' not necessarily just the rush toward 
implementation of Vice Chair Barr's recommendations.
    I would love to hear your thoughts on that path forward if, 
in fact, your job is to rubber-stamp the decisions of Vice 
Chair Barr or is your responsibility to take into consideration 
the Vice Chair's recommendations and then chart a path that 
seems to be consistent with what is in the best interest of our 
Nation, and frankly, of our financial institutions.
    I do not believe that increasing significantly the capital 
standards is in the best interest of small businesses or people 
looking for loans. The more capital we put on the sidelines, 
the less capital there is for us to see our financial 
institutions loaning the money out. I look forward to 
continuing our discussion during the question and answer time.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Scott.
    Today we will hear from the Chair of the Federal Reserve, 
Jerome Powell, on monetary policy and the state of our economy. 
Thank you for your public service, Chair Powell, and please 
present your testimony. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF JEROME H. POWELL, CHAIR, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE 
                     FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

    Mr. Powell. Thank you, Chairman Brown. Thank you, Ranking 
Member Scott, and other Members of the Committee. I appreciate 
the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual 
Monetary Policy Report.
    We at the Fed remain squarely focused on our dual mandate 
to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the 
American people. My colleagues and I understand the hardship 
that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly 
committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent 
goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal 
Reserve, and without it the economy does not work for anyone. 
In particular, without price stability we will not achieve a 
sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit 
all.
    I will review the current economic situation and then turn 
to monetary policy.
    The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, and recent 
indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to 
expand at a modest pace. Although growth in consumer spending 
has picked up this year, activity in the housing sector remains 
weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest 
rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on 
business fixed investment.
    The labor market remains very tight. Over the first 5 
months of the year, job gains averaged a robust 314,000 jobs 
per month. The unemployment rate moved up but remained low in 
May, at 3.7 percent. There are some signs that supply and 
demand in the labor market are coming into better balance. The 
labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, 
especially for individuals aged 25 to 54. Nominal wage growth 
has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined 
so far this year. While the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, 
labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of 
available workers.
    Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 
percent. Over the 12 months ending in April, total personal 
consumption, or PCE, prices rose 4.4 percent; excluding the 
volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 
percent. In May, the 12-month change in the consumer price 
index, or CPI, came in at 4.0 percent, and the change in the 
core CPI was 5.3 percent.
    Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last 
year. Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, 
and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has 
a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term 
inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as 
reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, 
businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial 
markets.
    With inflation remaining well above our longer-run goal of 
2 percent and with labor market conditions remaining tight, the 
FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. 
We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points 
since early last year and we have continued to reduce our 
securities holdings at a brisk pace. We have been seeing the 
effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest 
rate-sensitive sectors of the economy. It will take time, 
however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be 
realized, especially on inflation.
    The economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit 
conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to 
weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent 
of these effects remains uncertain.
    In light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the 
uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, 
and potential headwinds from credit tightening, the FOMC 
decided last week to maintain the target range for the Federal 
funds rate at 5 to 5\1/4\ percent and to continue the process 
of significantly reducing our securities holdings. Nearly all 
FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise 
interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year. But at 
last week's meeting, considering how far and how fast we have 
moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range steady to 
allow the Committee to assess additional information and its 
implications for monetary policy.
    In determining the extent of additional policy firming that 
may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, 
we will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary 
policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic 
activity and inflation, and economic and financial 
developments. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by 
meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their 
implications for the outlook for economic activity and 
inflation, as well as the balance of risks.
    We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 
2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation 
expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to 
require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of 
labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential 
to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable 
prices over the longer run.
    Before concluding, let me briefly address the condition of 
the banking sector. The U.S. banking system is sound and 
resilient. As detailed in the box on financial stability in the 
June Monetary Policy Report, the Federal Reserve, together with 
the Treasury Department and the FDIC, took decisive action in 
March to protect the U.S. economy and to strengthen public 
confidence in our banking system. The recent bank failures, 
including the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, and the resulting 
banking stress have highlighted the importance of ensuring we 
have the appropriate rules and supervisory practices for banks 
of this size. We are committed to addressing these 
vulnerabilities to make for a stronger and more resilient 
banking system.
    To conclude, we understand that our actions affect 
communities, families, and businesses across the country. 
Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the 
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment 
and price stability goals.
    Thank you.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Chair Powell.
    Paul Donovan at UBS has discussed the role that corporate 
profiteering plays in persistent inflation. While inflation has 
fallen from 9 percent, as you know, at its peak, to 4 percent, 
prices continue to climb because of supply shortages and 
corporate profiteering, what we are starting to call 
``greedflation.''
    Given that rising interest rates certainly will not solve 
greedflation, why maintain interest rates at the current level 
or even consider, as you suggested, raising them again, given 
the risk of harming the livelihoods of more than a million-and-
a-half workers and their families?
    Mr. Powell. Mr. Chairman, the committee broadly feels that 
while monetary policy has gotten to an appropriately 
restrictive level, if the economy performs about as expected 
that it will be appropriate to raise hikes again this year and 
perhaps twice. A strong majority of the committee feels that it 
will be appropriate again, assuming that the economy performs 
as expected two times before the end of this year.
    We have come very far, and the reason why we maintained our 
rate at the last meeting was to give ourselves more time to 
stretch out the time for making these decisions. We moved very 
quickly at the beginning, and we have gradually slowed down. 
This is just a continuation of that. But we are committed to 
getting inflation under control, and a strong majority of the 
committee feels that we are close but there is a little further 
to go with rate hikes.
    Chair Brown. Thank you for that answer, but, Mr. Chair, 
what Fed Governors call ``cooling down,'' regular people where 
I live call them ``layoffs.'' I mean, the question is why 
should working families continue to bear the cost of fighting 
inflation? Why should they lose their jobs so that corporate 
profits can continue to balloon?
    Let me move to the next question. Our economy has created 
13 million new jobs in the last 2\1/2\ years. Black and Latino 
workers, workers with the lowest incomes have seen the greatest 
gains in job opportunity and wage growth. What the Fed 
considers too hot an economy has given these workers their 
first leg up in decades, if ever. We know that job losses will 
hurt those same workers the most.
    How will higher interest rates and the resulting job losses 
disproportionately impact Black and Latino and low-income 
workers?
    Mr. Powell. Well, we have quite an unusual situation in the 
labor market, where we have had persistently much higher demand 
for workers than the available supply of workers. So some of 
the process of getting demand and supply back into alignment 
has been taking place through declining job openings and 
through lower quits rates and through wages that are moving--
they are still very high but moving into more sustainable 
levels of increase.
    So actually there has not been a meaningful increase in 
unemployment. The unemployment rate has bounced around as 
historically low levels, and that is fine. That would be the 
perfect way for this to continue to happen. There is no 
guarantee that it will happen. I would just say that it is 
working families who suffer most directly and quickly from high 
inflation, and it is for the benefit of those people and all 
other people that we need to restore 2 percent inflation in 
this country on a sustained basis.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, but the dual mandate suggests that 
those workers that obviously you look out for those jobs and 
those workers, but we also know that those workers are the 
first to be laid off. And I would hope that in your next 
meeting the Fed recognizes those disparities and gives them 
real weight as you make decisions that will likely, at some 
point, result in more layoffs.
    Probably my last question. Since you last testified in 
front of this Committee we have had three of the largest bank 
failures in U.S. history--you explored that a bit at the end of 
your testimony--because the executives at those banks failed at 
Banking 101. Regulators took swift and decisive actions to 
protect the banking system and depositors. Thank you for that. 
That is in stark contrast to regulators' supervisory failures 
in the years before the '08 financial crisis.
    What actions are you taking today to prevent more bank 
failures and to make sure banks do real risk management and 
address liquidity and other basic risks? And you may, in part, 
want to answer--I mean, he can do it himself, but Ranking 
Member Scott's comments on Vice Chair Barr and where that takes 
us. But what do you do to make sure banks do really risk 
management and address liquidity and other basic risks?
    Mr. Powell. I would say we are committed, and I am 
personally committed, to learning the right lessons from what 
happened in Silicon Valley Bank and the other two failures, and 
vigorously implementing appropriately. I think there is a clear 
need to strengthen both supervision and regulation of banks of 
that size, and I can go into more specifics in the course of 
the hearing. But I do think we need to learn those lessons, and 
I think we have started to do that, and it is something----
    You know, what we saw was an unexpected bank failure 
overnight led to contagion and threatened the broader banking 
system, and that is not supposed to happen, and we are going to 
take appropriate measures to reduce the chances that something 
like that would happen again.
    Chair Brown. Let me follow up briefly on that. The Fed 
plans to propose an overhaul, as we have talked about, to 
existing bank capital requirements, so we have a more resilient 
banking sector. Is increasing capital requirements for banks 
with $100 billion or more in assets to prevent future bank 
failures, is that a strategy the Fed plans to, is willing to 
deploy to promote financial stability?
    Mr. Powell. So there has not been a final proposal. There 
has been a draft proposal that has been circulated, but it is 
in my understanding it is not final, and I know things are 
still moving around a little bit. So I do not really have a 
final proposal that I can comment on. I do think that the 
capital increases that are getting so much notice are really on 
the larger banks. There may be also some capital increases in 
the proposal for banks down to $100 billion, but not below 
that.
    Chair Brown. And yesterday you said, ``We want, in 
particular, the GSIBs, the eight largest banks, to have high 
levels, very high levels of capital and liquidity.'' Do you 
stand by that statement?
    Mr. Powell. I did, and I said, of course, we did spend 
years raising capital and liquidity standards a great deal in 
those institutions, and I supported all of that. And I 
concluded by saying that further increases, if they are 
proposed, will need to be justified, of course, as any change 
in rule would be.
    Chair Brown. Senator Scott.
    Senator Scott. Chairman, let's stay with the capital 
requirements as you and the Chairman were talking about on the 
larger institutions, but frankly, throughout the entire banking 
system. Pre-financial crisis, capital levels were in the single 
digits. In the last decade it seems capital is continually 
being raised. My question is how much is too much, and when is 
enough enough?
    We are going down a path where something happens, or 
something goes wrong, and the only default solution seems to be 
to raise the capital standards or the capital on the sidelines. 
The formulas that I use are really simple formulas, the higher 
the capital standards, the lower the capital for the private 
sector, which means fewer loans and less capital for those who 
are actually creating jobs. So when we have too much capital on 
the sidelines then we have too little capital for actually 
creating and producing a vibrant economy. At some point, if you 
have raised it from single digits just a decade ago during the 
crisis, precrisis, to now, frankly, rumors are as high as 20 
percent for our GSIB as a possible outcome. How much is too 
much?
    Mr. Powell. I think that is exactly the right question. As 
you point out, there is a tradeoff between making the banks 
safer, more secure, more resilient. You want them to be very 
strong, particularly the largest banks, so that they can 
continue to intermediate and lend money and things like that, 
continue to function during even stressful situations. But with 
bank capital it is always going to be a tradeoff between the 
availability and cost of credit and how much safety, and I 
think that is the question we are going to be addressing and 
answering as part of this process.
    Senator Scott. As you continue to work on fighting 
inflation, which I think is job one, another simple formula for 
those of us in the real world of business we hear a lot of 
celebration around the jobs that are being created and the wage 
growth. But the way I look at it is, wage increase minus 
inflation has led to less spending power. Do you disagree with 
that?
    Mr. Powell. I think that is right.
    Senator Scott. So in the end, as we celebrate what seems to 
be a healthy economy, the truth of the matter is that the 
average person in our Nation today struggles to make their ends 
meet because of the inflationary impact on their bottom line, 
and what that means for them is there is a crisis for a single 
mother, like the one that raised me, or seniors on fixed 
incomes. And we have yet to, as a Nation, adjust for the 500 
basis point increase and how we service our debt. Said 
differently, the more money we have to use for servicing our 
debt, the less money we have for meeting the needs of the 
American people. Therefore, printing and spending $4 trillion 
after COVID was over has led to the inflation that we are 
seeing, and that, as a result, led to the ten rate increases. 
So how do you, as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, talk to 
policymakers about the importance of being responsible from a 
monetary perspective? I know I have seen and heard your 
comments that that is not your lane, but certainly the actions 
that we take here impacts, frankly, significantly what you have 
had to do in order to slow down Biden's absolutely explosive 
inflation.
    Mr. Powell. Let me start by saying--actually, you were 
talking about real wages a moment ago. Real wages actually did 
go up at the lower end of the income spectrum and now they are 
not as positive as we would like to see them.
    Senator Scott. Yes.
    Mr. Powell. But to your real question, you know, I would 
just say this, at the U.S. Federal budget is on an 
unsustainable path. It has been so for a long time. We need to 
deal with that sooner or later, and sooner is better than 
later. But that is what I can say, you know, and that is what 
essentially all of my predecessors have said. We are not 
charged with supervising fiscal policy in any way. But as a 
high-level matter from the standpoint of the economy, that is 
what I can say.
    Senator Scott. Here is another analogy that works for me as 
a former football player, a running back. If my line is not 
blocking and I keep getting my head hammered, I am going to say 
something to the line. At some point I think it is your 
responsibility to talk about the importance of fiscal 
responsibility. That to the side.
    My last thought, question for you is that SVB suffered 
because their bond portfolio ended up carrying water, in a 
negative way. You have an $8 trillion balance sheet and beyond. 
Every report that I have read is that your bond portfolio, our 
bond portfolio, the Fed, is under water as well. Can you talk 
to me about the losses that you are experiencing at the Fed 
from an [inaudible] perspective?
    Mr. Powell. Remember that the way it works at the Fed is 
when we buy assets during QE we pay for them with overnight 
interest rate reserves, and we have, for many, many years, 
during the QE era, we have earned a spread, and we have been 
sending money to the Treasury, way over $1 trillion since QE 
started.
    And so now that rates have gone back up to 5 percent, that 
process has reversed, and these are paper losses. They have 
absolutely no effect on our ability to conduct monetary policy 
or really on the economy. It is an accounting effect. If we 
retained capital then that would look completely different. But 
we do not. We give all of our profits to the Treasury.
    Senator Scott. So you were giving profits to the Treasury 
and now you are not. That has an actual effect. If I was 
getting 10 bucks and now I am not, there is an effect.
    Mr. Powell. Well, the Treasury will then have to borrow 
money that it does not get or raise taxes. It will have to get 
the money to carry out the spending that Congress authorizes. 
But that is not going to affect interest rates and things like 
that much.
    Senator Scott. To me, I have the holistic view of our 
economy where if, in fact, we have fewer dollars coming in, 
which requires us to raise taxes, that in the end it has a real 
impact on American taxpayers. But thank you.
    Mr. Powell. Thank you.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Scott.
    Senator Menendez, of New Jersey.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    After announcing the rate hike pause last week, you said 
that inflation has not reacted much to the Fed's past hikes, 
and I will admit I am a bit puzzled by that statement. The 
Fed's first rate hike was in March of last year, when non-core 
inflation was at 8.6 percent. It is now 4 percent, and core 
inflation has fallen as well. So that sounds like progress to 
me, especially when you consider that when according to the San 
Francisco Federal Reserve it can take more than a year for tax 
rate hikes to take full effect, which means that so far only 
three of the ten rate hikes since last year are in full effect.
    So can you expand a bit more on that statement from last 
week? What progress do you expect to see that you currently are 
not seeing?
    Mr. Powell. Sure. So of course you are absolutely right. 
Headline inflation has come down by essentially half, but that 
is largely due to energy prices coming down and commodity 
prices that go into food coming down. And I will not say that 
they are not affected at all by monetary policy, but they are 
principally affected by other things in the economy. You know, 
the war in Ukraine drove energy prices up quite a bit and also 
food prices. Those things are not principally a function of 
monetary policy, although we probably have some effect at the 
margin.
    So we look at core inflation and we look at how tight the 
economy is. We are seeing progress, for example, in supply 
chains getting better. That, again, is not really a function of 
monetary policy. Really, where monetary policy takes effect is 
in the service sector, and that is where we have not seen much 
progress. But we are seeing progress in other places. As you 
point out, inflation broadly is coming down. But as I said in 
my remarks, we still have a long way to go. Inflation is still 
running between 4 and 5 percent.
    Senator Menendez. So do you think that the lag period for 
rate hikes to affect inflation has lengthened or are rate hikes 
as a monetary policy tool becoming less effective?
    Mr. Powell. I do not think they are becoming less 
effective, but these are real questions. And the thing with 
lags is in this day and age financial conditions react before 
we act, so the markets are already pricing in rate hikes. So 
that is quicker. But the effect of those financial conditions 
on the economy still takes time. It works very quickly on 
housing, for example, but less so on the service sector, which 
is not very interest sensitive.
    So I do not think that has changed. Others have a different 
view and different directions they think in which it has 
changed. Also, there is not a consensus agreement on how long 
monetary policy takes to affect the economy. Some people think 
a very long time. Some people think right away. So I tend to 
think let's look at the middle of that, and a year and change, 
that is not a bad way to look at it. But policy actually 
started tightening well before that. We did not raise rates 
until March, but policy had already tightened substantially 
before the first rate hike in March.
    Senator Menendez. Well, I will say I know that you have a 
dual mandate. You know that as well. The last jobs report shows 
that unemployment is starting to tick upward for women and 
African Americans. So I hope that the cure is not more 
consequential than what we are trying to achieve.
    Recent reports reported that there is almost $1.5 trillion 
in commercial mortgages that will come due in the next 2 years, 
many of them held by small and regional lenders. With property 
values declining and interest rates rising, these mortgages 
could be serious liabilities for many banks. Do you think that 
we may see some banks fail as these mortgages come due, and if 
so, what can we do ahead of time to prevent that scenario?
    Mr. Powell. Of course we are spending a lot of time on 
these issues, and we have been for quite some time. And again, 
I think you put your finger on it. It is really which banks 
have concentrations, high concentrations of real estate, and 
that is not seen in the large banks. It is seen in some of the 
smaller banks.
    So we have identified those banks, and there is a 
supervisory toolkit where we work with banks to try to help 
them resolve those issues by raising capital or dealing with 
what is happening. Of course, what is happening in the office 
space nationally, there is an issue with people working from 
home and just less demand. There is a sort of one-time 
adjustment going on. There are also some other pockets of 
commercial real estate where there is some softness.
    So we are working with banks to work our way through this. 
We are very aware and very focused on the problem.
    Senator Menendez. Well, I am concerned that it is a ticking 
time bomb. And let me just say that last week you said that 
commercial real estate risks are unlikely to pose a systemic 
risk because the loans are broadly spread and mostly held by 
smaller banks. But how can we ensure that the potential losses 
in the commercial real estate do not lead to the draining of 
assets from smaller and mid-sized banks and then create further 
consolidation in the banking sector that brings us back to--I 
do not want to be back to 2008, when I was here and was asked 
to do extraordinary things.
    Mr. Powell. We certainly do not want to be there either, so 
we are being pretty proactive about reaching out to these 
institutions and trying to help them get through these 
significant issues. Again, it is not all smaller banks. It is 
just some of them have high concentrations in real estate. And 
it is not in the large banks, which, of course, was where the 
problem was in 2008 and 2009.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Menendez.
    Senator Kennedy, of Louisiana, is recognized for 5 minutes.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for 
being here, Mr. Chairman, and to your colleagues. Thanks to all 
of you for giving so much to our country.
    As you know, our fiscal year, meaning the Federal 
Government's fiscal year, begins October 1. We are in the 
process of putting together a budget. If we pass a budget--we, 
meaning Congress--passes a budget that increases spending by, 
let's say, 10 percent, roughly $650 billion, what will be the 
impact on inflation?
    Mr. Powell. So, of course, if it were funded by tax 
increases or other spending cuts, I guess in your hypothetical 
it is not. So, you know, I think deficit spending at the 
margins stimulates the economy at the margin. It is a big 
economy, though.
    Senator Kennedy. And what will be the impact on inflation?
    Mr. Powell. It would probably be a small effect on 
inflation ultimately, but there would be an effect through 
stimulation of the economy. It would be more demand, which 
would just, in general--I am not commenting on----
    Senator Kennedy. I know.
    Mr. Powell. ----I am sort of commenting on fiscal policy 
here, but nonetheless, there would be an effect on inflation.
    Senator Kennedy. I am just asking you about basic 
economics. I just read a piece by one of your economists from 
the San Francisco Fed, Mr. Shapiro, who is arguing that labor 
costs have virtually nothing to do with service inflation and 
is a negligible factor in broader inflation. And I read this 
stuff from some of your people, and I just wonder what planet 
they parachuted in from.
    If Congress passes a budget, and my prior example that 
reduces spending by 10 percent, roughly $650 billion, what 
impact will that have on inflation?
    Mr. Powell. So you would have less stimulus for demand, and 
you would be cutting programs if you did that, and therefore 
you would be slowing the economy down, and the impact would be 
less demand. Neither of these ideas affects the supply side at 
all, so less demand would mean less economic activity, less 
spending, and that would have a negative effect on inflation.
    Senator Kennedy. Well, more stimulus by Federal spending is 
inflationary. Is that right?
    Mr. Powell. So we have been in this situation where 
inflation was so stable for 25 years, you remember, and almost 
nothing that we did mattered for inflation. It is the so-called 
``flat Phillips curve, where there just was not a connection 
between how tight the economy is and inflation. That does not 
appear to be the case right now. I think many people would say 
that the Phillips curve is now not so flat and that there is an 
interaction between----
    Senator Kennedy. So that is a yes.
    Mr. Powell. I think that is a yes, yeah. This is economics, 
you know.
    Senator Kennedy. And less spending by Government, it means 
less stimulus, which tends to be disinflationary. Is that fair?
    Mr. Powell. Yes.
    Senator Kennedy. OK. Let me ask you about the Basel III 
Endgame. You know what I am talking about?
    Mr. Powell. I do.
    Senator Kennedy. There has been some reporting, and of 
course, not every country has to follow the Basel 
recommendations. The European Union is not following. They are 
going their own way, and we are kind of going our own way in 
America, using the Basel directives as a guidepost. But it has 
been reported that the Fed is going to raise capital 
requirements by as much as 20 percent--excuse me--it is going 
to raise capital requirements to 20 percent. Is that right?
    Mr. Powell. No. The idea would be to raise them by 20 
percent. In other words, 20 percent of whatever current capital 
requirements are, you would raise it by 20 percent of the total 
existing amount.
    Senator Kennedy. OK. So if JPMorgan's capital requirement 
right now is, let's say, 13 percent, it would go to 15 percent?
    Mr. Powell. Right. Something like that, if that were to be 
what happens.
    Senator Kennedy. And this will be for banks $100 billion or 
more?
    Mr. Powell. No, no. There is not a final proposal, and I 
know it is still in motion. I know things are still changing.
    Senator Kennedy. Yeah, but you folks are talking about it, 
and you are going to have a lot of input.
    Mr. Powell. That is right. That is right. But I will say--
sorry, your question was----
    Senator Kennedy. Are you going to raise capital 
requirements for 20 percent to banks $100 billion or more, or 
are you going to affect community banks as well, smaller banks?
    Mr. Powell. No. The capital requirements will be very, very 
skewed to the eight largest banks, the GSIBs. There may be some 
capital increases for the other banks, and I think none of this 
should affect banks under $100 billion.
    Senator Kennedy. The really big banks, you are talking 
about?
    Mr. Powell. Yes.
    Senator Kennedy. Are they the ones that are at risk right 
now?
    Mr. Powell. They were a source of strength and a place of 
strength during the recent turmoil.
    Senator Kennedy. They are doing pretty well.
    Mr. Powell. Yeah.
    Senator Kennedy. We have gone from ``too big to fail'' to 
we are damn happy they are big. I mean, have we not?
    Mr. Powell. Well, I would say, as I mentioned, you know, we 
spent a lot of time and a lot of effort raising the capital 
standards 10 years ago and more recently, and I supported all 
of that and was happy to do so, and I think----
    Chair Brown. Senator Kennedy's time has expired.
    Senator Smith, of Minnesota.
    Senator Kennedy. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Kennedy, as you always do, 
on schedule, on time.
    Senator Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Ranking Member, and 
Chair Powell, welcome back to the Committee.
    I have a slightly different perspective than Senator 
Kennedy does on this question of inflation and debt. You know, 
I do not think that discretionary spending is the problem when 
it comes to our Federal budget. If you look at it, military and 
non-defense discretionary spending has hovered at about 3 
percent of GDP for the last 30 years. And in fact, 
discretionary spending has decreased over the last 30 years. So 
clearly that is not the problem with what is going on with our 
debt. It is not what is driving debt growth. The big change is 
in revenues.
    So the national debt has increased nearly 100 percent of 
GDP because of the Bush and the Trump tax cuts. And without 
those tax cuts--in other words, if we had left our tax levels 
at roughly what they were in the Clinton administration, which 
in no way restrained economic growth, the budget would only 
have been significantly out of balance during the Great 
Recession and during COVID.
    So Chair Powell, I am not going to ask you to comment on 
that because I know you do not like to comment on fiscal 
policy, but I feel that that is important context for the 
Committee to have as we think about what is inflation and what 
we are doing about it.
    I have been really struck by how remarkably resilient the 
labor market has been over the last 16 months or so, which is a 
good thing as we do the work we want to do to grow the middle 
class and create more opportunity and more financial security 
for people. And so rates have risen ten times, yet unemployment 
is still near historic lows, and wages are growing.
    Now as you and others have pointed out, real wage growth 
has been clearly impacted by inflation, which is a real 
challenge for especially middle-class families, working 
families, although I believe, as you said Chair Powell--let me 
just check this--that real wage growth has ticked up in the 
last couple of months. Is that right? Do I have that right?
    Mr. Powell. So at the beginning it was high real wage, 
positive real wage growth only at the bottom of the income 
spectrum. I believe now, on a 12-month basis, that overall 
wages are moving up faster than inflation, just recently.
    Senator Smith. Right. And so, I mean, clearly we are not 
there yet. Clearly we have more work to do. I am encouraged by 
the progress that we have made so far. And I also just want to 
point out that the significant investments that we have been 
making in domestic manufacturing, in bringing supply chains 
home, and supporting prevailing wage jobs, I think are an 
important part of this success story, this economics success 
story, not mitigating the impact and the need to continue to 
bring inflation back down.
    So Chair Powell, my question for you is, you said last 
week, and you are saying today, that while the labor market 
remains tight you are seeing signs that labor supply and demand 
are falling back into sync. Do you see a path for inflation to 
continue slowing without us seeing significant job losses and 
doing harm to middle-class families, working families?
    Mr. Powell. I do continue to see that path, and you are 
right, the labor market is really the strength of the economy. 
It is what is driving the economy. It is very, very strong 
demand for workers, and workers are getting jobs, and they are 
getting paid, and they are spending money, and that is driving 
demand, and the whole thing. And it is gradually cooling, and 
that is what we would want to see.
    So I think there is a path, and ideally the means by which 
demand and supply get back into alignment will involve things 
like the job openings rate coming down as opposed to the 
unemployment rate going up. Although, you know, if you look at 
our forecast, it is not a desired objective, but we do expect, 
on this path, that the unemployment rate will go up a little 
further because it is historically low. Even at 3.7 percent, 
you know, until the last few years we really have not seen that 
in 50 years. So we do think it will come up a little bit, but 
ideally most of the loosening will come in the form of other 
ways.
    Senator Smith. Right. And so to the extent that we are able 
to pursue policies that strengthen the labor market, that 
contribute to the resiliency of the labor market, it seems as 
if that should help to mitigate the negative impacts on the 
labor market that rising rates would have, because, in effect, 
what rising rates do is it slows growth and potentially leads 
to layoffs.
    Mr. Powell. So our part of it is to try to get inflation 
under control, and that is what we are doing, and ideally we 
will do that with as little as possible damage to the economy 
and the labor market.
    Senator Smith. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. 
Chair.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Smith.
    Senator Tillis, of North Carolina, is recognized.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chair Powell, thank 
you for being here.
    I have got a quick question. Yesterday Governor Cook said 
in this Committee that the Basel Endgame proposal from the Vice 
Chair, she has not had an opportunity to look at it. Now we 
hear reports that I think it is 1,000 pages long, probably with 
a lot of technical information. How much time are the voting 
principals going to have to fully review and vet this proposal, 
and is there any expectation that that review would result in 
any changes, or is it just a matter of them either say yes or 
no, they agree with Barr's recommendations?
    Mr. Powell. So, you know, I would say we will make sure, I 
will make sure that there is enough time for Governors to 
review the final proposal. We have been briefed on the contents 
of it, and it is still in motion. There will be a proposal that 
comes to the board for approval, and it will be subject to 
discussion, and it is possible there would be further changes 
before the vote or as a result of the vote. But we will make 
sure people have time to review it.
    Senator Tillis. As you are going through the review 
process, do you believe that it would be appropriate to give 
Members of this Committee, or Members of Committee a sort of 
roadmap for what the recommendations entail, prior to moving 
forward?
    Mr. Powell. So I think that will happen because I think 
Vice Chair Barr would probably be giving public remarks at some 
point before the meeting, and I understand now that the head of 
the FDIC actually gave a speech this morning. I did not see it, 
but I know he gave a speech about this subject.
    Senator Tillis. Can you explain why comments from Mr. Barr 
about having a safe and sound banking system square with a 
banking system that needs additional capital?
    Mr. Powell. So the question is, of course, we spent all 
those years raising capital for the largest banks, and I think 
further increases will have to be justified. We have always 
known that the Basel III Endgame was going to bring some 
capital increases and bring a discussion about the tradeoffs, 
and there are tradeoffs between higher capital, and that is the 
discussion that we are going to be having. We have not had it 
yet, but we will.
    Senator Tillis. I watched your opening testimony in my 
office. Actually, Gus was there, and he says hello. Chair 
Powell has met my office dog.
    Mr. Powell. Hello back to Gus. Tell him I said he was a 
good boy.
    Senator Tillis. Mr. Chair, you got me. I am kind of curious 
about Silicon Valley Bank now. Yesterday we had an appropriate 
hearing and a markup on executive compensation. I voted against 
it for a couple of reasons. I think we need to work on more 
tailoring, and I hope as it moves through we can work in good 
faith to address some things that would get me to a yes.
    But one of the concerns I had about that meeting is I think 
we could pass an executive comp bill and think that we are done 
with the root causes of Silicon Valley Bank. I, for one, think 
it was equal parts of management malpractice and supervisory 
malpractice.
    So the question I have is who, in the Fed, is ultimately 
going to give me a straight answer on what the breakdowns were 
in the supervisory functions, who those people were, and to the 
extent that we have found less than adequate supervision, what 
is the disposition of their jobs? Who is that person? Because I 
ask everybody, and they say it is not in their lane. So who is 
the person that, in the same way that we have mapped the CEO 
and various members of the bank having made egregious decisions 
that they should have their compensation clawed back, who can I 
talk to that says, ``We have looked at the supervisory process, 
here were some lapses, they did not use the optionality of 
2155.'' We now are seeing increased reports of MRAs and MRIAs, 
so I think there are supervisors out there that are probably 
understanding Senate Bill 2155 better.
    But who can answer that question for me? This comes down to 
a handful of human beings who were responsible for the 
supervisory functions of SVB.
    Mr. Powell. It is tough for me to say that something is not 
in my lane----
    Senator Tillis. Yeah.
    Mr. Powell. ----and I actually think tough for Vice Chair 
Barr. So it is our lane.
    So if I can address what it is you are asking, though, it 
is, I would say, supervisory failures, and let's not just say 
San Francisco. It is very much at the board. We are 
accountable. It is a delegated function. It is definitely at 
the board. The buck stops at the board on supervision, not at 
San Francisco Reserve Bank, although they are involved.
    So we need to learn lessons, and we need to implement 
changes. It is not just supervision, though. We need to fix 
liquidity regulation. It is just a different world, and the 
regulation for liquidity, the LCR and the NSFR, they are just 
not adequate to a world where people are moving money around on 
their phones like that. So we are doing all of that. I think we 
are doing it very transparently and rapidly.
    The piece of it that you will not be satisfied with is in 
public service people, if they engage in malfeasance, if they 
conduct criminal behavior, if they break rules and things like 
that, they get fired. Nothing like that happened here. The San 
Francisco Fed, they had identified the issues, they had 
notified the management team, but it just was not forceful 
enough. And that is a problem with our system, I think. Bank 
regulation is a very kind of procedural oriented thing, where 
you are raising things like that. And we need to be able to be 
nimble and more forceful, where appropriate, not every day on 
every decision but on where it is appropriate. So that is what 
I think we are working on now.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, and again, thank you. You have 
been very accessible. I am going to try and request a meeting 
after the recess. Sometime this summer I would like to get back 
with you, and we will be submitting questions for the record.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Tillis. I would add that I 
do not think that Congress and 2155 and Barr's predecessor, Mr. 
Quarles, weakening the rules even more, and frankly all of you 
at the Fed, in those earlier days and the Congress and the 
Administration, those earlier days, are off the hook either for 
Silicon Valley Bank.
    Senator Van Hollen, of Maryland, is recognized.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, 
Mr. Chairman, Chairman Powell.
    I just want to make sure I have a couple of observations 
straight in looking at the most recent report, beginning with 
wage growth, because throughout the last couple of years we 
have seen rising wages. We have also seen, of course, rising 
prices. But it has been my observation that for lower-wage 
workers, the people who are working paycheck to paycheck, real 
wages are up. In other words, the increase in their wages 
outpaced the increase in prices they were facing.
    And your latest report seems to indicate that that trend is 
actually even more broad-based right now. Could you speak to 
that?
    Mr. Powell. That is right, exactly right. At the beginning 
of the pandemic, the wages went up a great deal for people in 
those public-facing service jobs that are relatively low paid 
because that is where the shortages were, and they got positive 
real wages. But that has now spread. I think overall, on a 12-
month basis, you now have wage growth, by most measures, that 
is higher than inflation, so real wages going up.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, that is obviously a good-news 
story for the economy. Let me ask you about labor force 
participation because we have also seen more people reentering 
the labor force. Obviously, that helps with inflation, wage 
inflation. And I understand that immigration actually has been 
an important part of that. Could you speak to the role of 
immigration in that sense?
    Mr. Powell. Sure. So participation has moved up, I think, 
more than we had expected. It did not move up last year--we 
were very disappointed--and now it has moved up, so that is 
more people in the labor force.
    The other thing that has happened, though, is immigration 
basically went to almost zero during the pandemic, and there 
has been quite a strong rebound in immigration, and that is 
creating more people in the workforce. So we think one of the 
reasons why businesses are reporting that labor supply and 
demand are getting into better balance is because of both 
participation and immigration.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. I am still hearing, and I 
know you are, and it is still a real phenomenon, that there are 
huge workforce shortages, especially in health care, nursing, 
all sorts of areas, and I look forward to identifying ways to 
deal with those issues.
    So just a broad question on how you approach the decisions 
regarding interest rates, and I very much support the decision 
you and your colleagues made to pause the increase in interest 
rates. I understand you are going to continue to monitor the 
situation. I understand the signaling you have already given 
regarding the future.
    But you obviously have a dual mandate. You have a mandate 
to maximize employment. You also have a price stability 
mandate. But then you also have this other responsibility 
regarding being a prudential regulator, overseeing the banks, 
including Silicon Valley Bank.
    So my question is this. To what extent did the crash at 
Silicon Valley Bank, and to what extent does continuing 
concerns about stability in the banking area impact the 
decision that you make going forward with respect to interest 
rates? How is that factoring in?
    Mr. Powell. So there is pretty substantial research showing 
that when you have a shock to banking, like the one we had in 
March, to a sector of the banking industry, that if you come 
back in 6 months you will see lower lending, and it does not 
appear immediately but it is strong in the data. So that does 
play a part, at least in my thinking, that there may be a bit 
more tightening in the pipeline than there otherwise would have 
been. Now we do not really see evidence of it yet, but then 
again, we would not expect to see it.
    But it all points, to me, in the same direction. We moved 
very, very quickly when we had to move quickly. We have been 
slowing down since last December, from 75, to 50, to 25 at 
every meeting, and now we are getting very close. We are at 
least close to where we think our destination is, where we 
think it is, and it only makes common sense to move at a 
careful pace. We do not want to do more than we have to, but we 
do think, overwhelmingly, people on the committee do think that 
there are more rate hikes coming, but we want to make them at a 
pace that allows us to see incoming information, so we make 
good decisions.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Vance is recognized, from Ohio.
    Senator Vance. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and Chair Powell, 
thanks for being here. Good to see you.
    I want to sort of pick up on some of the question that 
Senator Tillis was asking about Basel III, and in particular, 
some of the capital requirements and how they affect the 
regional banking ecosystem, in particular. And maybe we can 
just sort of start with some background on the Silicon Valley 
Bank situation, just to make sure we are on the same page. I 
suspect we agree on this, but I want to sort of make sure, and 
if not have a discussion about it.
    So Silicon Valley Bank, I think we sort of broadly agree 
that the reason the bank ultimately collapsed is they were way 
too exposed to long-term interest rate risk, because the 
interest rates went up, their balance sheet deteriorated, that 
that, of course, led to a liquidity crisis, and then the bank 
was put into receivership.
    One thing that I have heard a lot of folks talk about, and 
this is in the context of Basel III but also in other contexts 
as well, is the idea that we need to increase capital 
requirements, in particular, on some of the small and medium-
sized banks. If we adopted Basel III, of course, that would 
happen.
    But as I understand it, if Silicon Valley Bank, let's say, 
in the years leading up to the crisis, were exposed to higher 
capital requirements, is it not plausible that they would have 
satisfied those higher capital requirements by buying more 
long-term Treasuries?
    Mr. Powell. Well, it does not matter what the assets were. 
Capital is the difference between your assets and your 
liabilities. If they had had more assets, of whatever 
character, including Treasuries, then they would have had more 
capital.
    Senator Vance. Exactly. So to be really clear here, if they 
had bought long-term Treasuries--not say that they would have 
done that--but if they had had a higher capital requirement and 
they bought long-term Treasuries, additional long-term 
Treasuries, that would have, in fact, satisfied the higher 
capital requirement. In other words, Treasuries could have been 
used as capital.
    Mr. Powell. Treasuries are capital.
    Senator Vance. Well, no. They are an asset.
    Mr. Powell. Sorry. Treasures are assets. You would have had 
to fund that somehow.
    Senator Vance. But then the follow-up question is, given 
how poor of a job they did in hedging against the long-term 
interest rate risk, if they had bought more long-term 
Treasuries, do we think their balance sheet would have been in 
a better or worse shape?
    Mr. Powell. They would have had a bigger loss, and more to 
the point, they would have still had overwhelmingly uninsured 
deposits.
    Senator Vance. Of course. So the point that I am making, 
which I am sure you can kind of understand here, is that 
capital requirements are not necessarily a panacea to the type 
of banking run that we saw in the Silicon Valley Bank case. I 
think there is a very good argument that higher capital 
requirements on Silicon Valley Bank would have made the bank 
run worse, or even could have made it a more catastrophic or an 
even quicker failure. And at the very least, I do not think 
they would have helped. Do you agree with that?
    Mr. Powell. I think there is a lot to unpack with Silicon 
Valley Bank. And the thing is, remember, it was a capital 
issue. They were trying to raise capital. That is what was 
going on. And the market was very focused on their portfolio 
losses, which were highlighted by the fact that they tried to 
raise capital. So there was a capital issue there.
    Now, you are right. If you had filled the capital hole by--
you have to retain earnings or get some new equity, and if you 
just use that to buy Treasuries then yeah, it would not have 
made things better.
    Senator Vance. Yeah. I appreciate that.
    So one just final question I have really is about the 
operation of the Fed here. You know, we have talked about this 
privately. I have talked about this a lot on this Committee. I 
know the Chairman shares this concern. You know, we have a lot 
of mid-tier banks in the State of Ohio, and I think that mid-
tier, that three-tier banking ecosystem is really, really 
important.
    Huntington Bank in Columbus, Ohio, I believe, is the single 
largest SBA lender. If you look at the commercial and small 
business lending, a lot of it is being done by the mid-tier 
banks. And I feel like they are facing a lot of pressure from 
regulators and just in their business model because they have 
seen some flight of deposits away from them and toward the 
larger banks. So I really worry about the potential problems we 
are creating for these banks, from both a regulatory and a 
business model perspective.
    But I wonder, Chairman Powell, do you guys have, I mean, at 
the Federal Reserve, do you guys have a standardized approach 
where you try to understand the capital cost of each tier of 
our banking system? Is that something you do not concern 
yourself with, or is it?
    Mr. Powell. No. We definitely concern ourselves with that. 
All of us--and I will just speak for myself--really believe 
that we are lucky to have such a diverse group of institutions, 
from the community banks through the smaller regionals, the big 
regionals. That is a great feature of America and of our 
economy because, you know, they are just important in their own 
ways. So we try hard not to do a one-size-fits-all thing.
    Senator Vance. Of course. If I can, just one more final 
question here, Mr. Chairman. Do you have a good sense of what 
the capital cost is for the biggest banks, the sort of 
systemically important banks, versus the mid-tier banks? Like 
what is the capital cost difference, broadly speaking? Maybe we 
will follow up in a written question. But I am very curious 
about how you guys think about that different capital cost 
because it informs a lot of the policy we make. Thank you.
    Mr. Powell. I would be happy to have that conversation.
    Senator Vance. I appreciate it.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Vance.
    Senator Fetterman, of Pennsylvania, is recognized.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman 
Powell, sincerely, thank you for being here today. And first 
and foremost, I believe that the Fed must make sure that we 
have an economy that truly works for working families. I 
suspect you would agree. And the reality is that the tool of 
cooling the economy with interest hikes can push people out of 
jobs.
    We want to drive down inflation, of course. That makes 
sense. But we do not want to hurt working people to suffer. You 
know, how do you kind of square that together, because it is 
quite a paradox.
    Mr. Powell. So it is working people who are the most hurt 
by inflation. It is a bit of a paradox. I would agree.
    Senator Fetterman. Quite the paradox. You are absolutely 
right.
    Mr. Powell. It is. So if you are living on a fixed income 
and you are spending every dollar on necessities of life--
transportation, fuel, food, clothing--and inflation goes up, 
you are in trouble right away. You do not have a safety net. 
You are not a middle class or wealthier person. So it is for 
those people that we need to get inflation under control.
    It is also the case, though, that the tool that we have, 
and we are the organization that is charged with price 
stability, is to cool off demand so that demand and supply get 
into better alignment over time. And we, of course, would love 
to do that in the current situation with as little effect on 
the labor market as we can. And there is much cooling that can 
take off in the labor market that does not involve higher 
unemployment.
    However, I cannot guarantee that restoring price stability 
would not have some implications of higher unemployment, but 
you have to think that restoring price stability will pay 
benefits to everybody, especially low- and moderate-income 
people, for decades.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you, and I agree. It is just such 
a paradox because you have a dual mandate, and now we are going 
to kind of change the gears. It is clear that inflation over 
the last years, there have been many causes, including rampant 
corporate price gouging and monopolies. While Americans have 
gotten ripped off, executives and shareholders have raked in 
record profits. It is deeply immoral.
    I understand that it is not the policing price gouging and 
not in the Fed's jurisdiction, but you might look at smart ways 
to fight inflation. Is it fair to say that big businesses have 
been jacking up their prices and way more than their costs have 
increased? Is that accurate?
    Mr. Powell. So I think what has happened during the 
pandemic was supply was constricted. Cars is a great example. 
So the demand for cars went through the roof because people did 
not want to take public transportation, and rates were very low 
so demand was just very, very high. And we could not make cars. 
Literally, the production of cars went down because there were 
not enough semiconductors. I mean, I personally did not realize 
that you needed a lot of semiconductors in a car, but now 
everybody knows that.
    So what happened was, how do you decide who gets the cars? 
So the prices went up a lot. Car prices went up because when 
there is a lot of demand and restricted supply you get higher 
prices.
    As the economy returns to normal function and we have more 
semiconductors now, supply chains are getting better, what is 
happening is corporate profit margins are coming back down, as 
you would expect. And so that is just the way the economy is 
working.
    Senator Fetterman. So is it fair to say that you do not 
believe that price gouging was not a factor?
    Mr. Powell. So I think that the collision between very 
strong demand and limited supply was a big factor, particularly 
as it relates to goods inflation. It is not much of a factor as 
it relates to housing services inflation or services inflation, 
which account for about three-quarters of inflation.
    Senator Fetterman. OK. Thank you.
    Mr. Powell. Thank you.
    Senator Fetterman. Ceding the time back to the Chairman.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Fetterman.
    Senator Daines, of Montana, is recognized.
    Senator Daines. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Mr. Powell, good 
to have you here this morning.
    In Montana as well as the Mountain West, inflation remains 
above 5 percent. In fact, we are higher than any other region 
in the Nation, whether it is gas stations, grocery stores, 
increasing prices, and its real-life impacts remain truly a 
top-of-mind and daily issue for Montanans.
    With inflation remaining stubbornly high I cannot help but 
reflect on the warning signs that were ignored by my colleagues 
across the aisle while they raced to push through trillions of 
dollars in partisan spending disguised as COVID relief, and now 
the American people are bearing the brunt of this reckless 
spending. In fact, for the average American, unless you have 
received a nearly 16 percent pay raise over the past 2 years, 
you have effectively received a pay cut.
    Chair Powell, I urge you and the Fed to remain vigilant and 
steadfast in your effort to rein in inflation for the sake of 
all Americans.
    Unfortunately, record high inflation is not the only crisis 
the Fed is having to navigate. While bank regulators were more 
focused on climate change than actually regulating the banks 
and other supervision, several coastal banks collapsed and 
caused panic across the banking sector. Before the dust even 
settled, several of my colleagues across the aisle immediately 
began calling for increased regulations and greater capital 
requirements for banks with little appreciation for the 
negative impacts these changes would have on small and mid-
sized banks across the country. I have heard from community 
banks across Montana who are justifiably concerned that they 
will be wrongfully punished for the actions of a few poorly 
regulated and poorly managed banks.
    You mentioned several times in your testimony yesterday and 
again here today that the U.S. banks remain strong and well 
capitalized. Chair Powell, if banks are so well capitalized, 
why the urgency now to increase capital requirements that would 
really prevent another Silicon Valley Bank?
    Mr. Powell. Well, let me say first that we do not have a 
final proposal to talk about yet. When we do, we will be able 
to talk much more specifically. About it.
    For community banks and any banks under $100 billion, I do 
not think they are going to be part of this proposal. So we are 
really talking about principally the very largest banks, the 
GSIBs, and to a lesser extent the regionals, and then the banks 
between 100 and 250.
    And you asked the right question. You know, the question 
is, is more capital the answer, and we will be addressing that. 
We will be making a proposal. We will be soliciting public 
comment on that. I am well aware that there is a tradeoff here. 
More capital means more stable banks. It means stronger banks. 
But there is also a tradeoff there, and with capital you have 
got to make a judgment about where you draw that line.
    Senator Daines. Yeah, and then to that point, increasing 
the capital requirements could, in turn, decrease lending. Will 
the impact this has on small businesses who may not be able to 
get a loan be taken into account before you finalize your 
proposal?
    Mr. Powell. Yes. I mean, the thing is stronger capital 
means banks will be able to continue to lend during difficult 
times too. So that is why we do it, is for those stressful 
times. But it is a judgment call, and there is a lot of science 
and arithmetic that goes into it, but ultimately deciding how 
high to go is a challenging question.
    So we are going to be making a proposal, and I will 
personally be listening carefully to the comments.
    Senator Daines. You alluded to focus more on the GSIBs and 
trying to spare the smaller banks, perhaps, from the impact. 
And I realize the proposal is still being developed. It is not 
finely baked yet. But are you prepared to commit to sparing the 
smaller community banks from changes the Fed might propose on 
capital requirements?
    Mr. Powell. So let me say my understanding is that the 
proposal does not affect banks under $100 billion, and I would 
have serious questions as to why it would. And particularly 
most community banks, for example, in your State, are much 
smaller than $100 billion, and I do not know why we would be 
looking at their capital. They are generally quite well 
capitalized.
    Senator Daines. Great. Thank you.
    I want to turn back to inflation, back to that earlier 
statement. I appreciate the wait-and-see approach the FMOC took 
at its most recent meeting. As I noted in my remarks, inflation 
does remain stubbornly high, particularly in the Mountain West, 
and labor markets remain as tight as we have ever seen. It was 
noted, however, that the committee is poised to continue 
raising rates later this year.
    My final question. Could you expand just a bit more on your 
outlook for the rest of the year and speak to your continued 
commitment to do whatever is necessary to bring inflation back 
to your 2 percent target?
    Mr. Powell. Yes. So I think if you look at the committee's 
forecasts, and mine are very similar, we expect modest growth 
going forward, growth below the sort of longer run growth rate 
of the United States economy, which is around 2 percent or a 
little bit less, growth lower than that. And we expect the 
labor market to continue to gradually cool off, and with that 
there is an expectation that inflation will continue to move 
down later this year. And if things happen that are sort of 
broadly in keeping with that, the strong majority of the 
committee believes that it will be appropriate to raise the 
Federal funds rate again once or twice by the end of the year. 
A strong majority came down on twice, between now and the end 
of the year.
    So I think the data will tell us what to do. I think the 
point of our meeting, the last meeting, was really to moderate 
the pace of our decision making on this, because it was very 
important to move quickly last year, and we did. It is not so 
important now because we have come so far and we are relatively 
close, we think, to where we need to get. But, I mean, people 
should believe, and broadly speaking the data show that they do 
believe, that we will do what it takes to get inflation down to 
2 percent over time.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Daines.
    Senator Hagerty, from Tennessee, is recognized.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Chairman 
Powell, good to see you again.
    I would like to start with something that has troubled me 
since our hearing yesterday regarding the Basel III Endgame 
proposal that is coming forward by Vice Chair Barr. The 
proposal can have far-reaching ramifications, I think. It is 
rumored to have over 1,000 pages in it. Yet when I asked 
Governor Cook about the proposal yesterday she told me she had 
not seen it and has not reviewed it. And my understanding is 
that the agencies, including the Fed, are due to vote on this 
on the 18th of July.
    And given the fact that I think Senator Warner described it 
aptly yesterday, the potential for a perfect storm here, if the 
rumors that we are hearing about capital requirement increases 
that may be proposed are true, this may come at a time, banks 
may be preparing for a capital increase at a time when we 
absolutely need banks to be lending, not constraining lending 
by raising capital requirements.
    So I think there are numerous analyses, the impacts on the 
small business community, on the banking system need to be 
taken into account. And I am very concerned, particularly in 
light of Governor Cook's response as she has not reviewed it, 
has not seen it, and did not seem to have any perspective on it 
at this point in time. It is a very short window to undertake a 
decision on something as complex as we may be talking about, 
with over 1,000 pages in this report.
    So my question of you is, how will this process be managed 
at the Fed in terms of the decision making and the analyses 
that need to take place?
    Mr. Powell. So I will make sure that the Governors have 
enough time to carefully evaluate this. The staff has been 
briefing Governors for the past few weeks, but the proposal is 
still evolving, though. I mean, I am hearing, even as recently 
as this morning, things are moving still. So it is not 
possible, when you say we have not seen it, we have not seen a 
final proposal. There is not something to send to the 
committee. And you can be briefed on the current state of where 
things are, and I have been, in detail, but ultimately when you 
sit down to read this large document, I am going to wait for 
the final version to really do that.
    But you are right to point to the need for time to evaluate 
it.
    Senator Hagerty. Yeah. Governor Cook's response to me, as 
she deflected yesterday, just left me with a great concern, so 
I appreciate it. No need to rush here, given the significance 
of what is happening, and frankly, the other concerns you and I 
have discussed in terms of where we are today, I think it 
warrants very deep consideration.
    I would like to turn to another item that you and I have 
also discussed in the past, Mr. Chairman, and that has to do 
with bank mergers. If you think about a potential bank that is 
in distress, all things being equal, would we be better off for 
that bank, that distressed bank, to undertake a merger or 
acquisition, or would we be better off to let it enter into 
receivership?
    Mr. Powell. The former, certainly.
    Senator Hagerty. I agree with you. Yet we also, in the case 
of First Republic Bank, it was like a slow-moving train. The 
stock price had collapsed, they were actually, at my 
understanding, 11 different financial institutions that put 
forward proposals that would have been a rescue package for the 
bank, yet none went far enough to achieve an actual merger or 
an acquisition in that place. In fact, they let it go into 
receivership. And my concern is that this Administration has 
created such a negative environment for consolidations that it 
is a real issue.
    My question of you is, do you think the current state we 
are, should we allow more banks to merge, especially given the 
stress that we are seeing in the system?
    Mr. Powell. I think there was every chance given, and much 
hope bestowed on the idea of having that bank sold before it 
went into receivership. They could not make it happen, and that 
is unfortunate. Everyone would have loved to see that outcome 
rather than a receivership. No one wanted that to be the case.
    Senator Hagerty. I am certainly in that camp as well. And 
my view is that there is an environment right now of 
uncertainty, as the banking community looks at mergers and 
acquisitions, and the guidance that the White House has given, 
very negative in terms of mergers and acquisitions against 
consolidations. I think that institutions are very reticent to 
move forward. And that is why I have introduced the Depositor 
Protection Act, which, among its many provisions, it is going 
to provide a green light to well-capitalized, well-rated banks 
to merge with institutions that are under distress without 
having regulatory interference.
    And so as the Committee moves forward I hope that we are 
going to have opportunity to work on this new legislation. I 
hope we can remove needless regulatory hurdles, and I hope we 
can actually encourage mergers and acquisitions that would 
protect taxpayers.
    One final point I would like to raise with you, Mr. Chair. 
It is something that you identified nearly a decade ago. At 
that point in time, the Fed created a Reverse Repo Facility 
that was intended to be a tool that would put a floor on 
interest rates. The facility was targeted on investment 
vehicles like money market funds, which actually play a 
significant role in the short-term funding markets.
    At that time you joined others on the board in expressing 
concern about the possible consequences of this facility, 
particularly in times of market stress. That is where this 
facility could actually exacerbate the so-called flight to 
safety. Since that time, this facility has grown to over $2 
trillion worth of overnight deposits at the Fed.
    So I would love for you to walk us through, if you might, 
the potential risks that this facility might pose, and take us 
through how it relates to basically pulling the deposits out of 
the banking system at a time when we would like to retain those 
deposits.
    Mr. Powell. The Reverse Repo Facility really has not 
increased. In fact, it has shrunk in size since the events of 
March. So it is really not on net accounting firms that decline 
in deposits. Really, what is happening there is that market 
rates are higher than deposit rates, and depositors are moving 
their money. This happens in every cycle.
    Senator Hagerty. May I interrupt for just a moment?
    Mr. Powell. Please.
    Senator Hagerty. So are my numbers incorrect that we now 
have $2 trillion that are parked in this facility by money 
market funds?
    Mr. Powell. We had $2.5 trillion before March, so it has 
come down in size. In fact, now that the debt ceiling is solved 
and they are refilling the Treasury general account, the 
Reverse Repo Facility has been declining, and that is what we 
would have hoped to see, rather than taking reserves out of the 
system.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Warner is recognized.
    Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, the 
challenge of coming a bit late, you kind of asked my question. 
But Chairman, great to see you again. I am going to at least 
ask a variation, and it might be the same question I think a 
number of Members have asked. You know, I know a lot of us 
sometimes get the advantage of being Monday morning 
quarterbacks on how you navigate the monetary policy. I think 
you have generally done a pretty good job. I am very grateful 
that you are on a pause. I hope that pause, as the data comes 
through, continues. But we definitely have some stresses with 
that monetary policy.
    Second, you were doing what, again, I think people on both 
sides of the aisle have called for, in terms of quantitative 
tightening. Again, that does not have the immediate effect that 
the monetary policy has. But as we have discussed, and I think 
Senator Hagerty raised, we also have the appropriate review 
that Vice Chair for Supervision Barr is doing on capital 
standards. And I think Senator Hagerty and my staff told me 
they even used the term I was going to use of ``perfect storm'' 
of these three all coming together.
    Senator Hagerty. I borrowed your term from yesterday, and 
we can properly acknowledge that, Senator Warner.
    Senator Warner. I will call it a very stressful situation. 
And I understand, and I think you pointed out, my friend from 
Tennessee, the capital requirements will phase in, but you 
could have all three of these events come together. I think you 
have addressed this already, but I just want to add my voice to 
that concern. You have got a lot of jobs. Safety and soundness, 
inflation control, and full employment, that full employment 
piece could be affected by this potential perfect storm. And 
again, I hope all of your colleagues--I raised with the other 
Members, the nominees for the Fed yesterday, and I hope you 
will--again, I think you have been asked in the House and you 
have been asked here--I do not know if you have got anything 
else you want to add to what you have already responded on 
that.
    Mr. Powell. I will just say you are right. We are thinking 
very much about that. Fortunately, it has been orderly. The 
shrinkage of the balance sheet has been quite orderly. There is 
still a very, very high level of cash reserves in the system, 
and we do not think they will be scarce any time soon. We think 
the refilling of the Treasury general account, people have been 
focused on that for a couple of months. So far, early days, 
that seems to be going well. We are watching it very carefully.
    Senator Warner. But again, and it is easy to sometimes sit 
up here and attack rather than manage all three of these, but 
there could be this moment in time where these factors all come 
together that could have a really negative effect on the 
economy.
    Let me move to something that I think has not been raised. 
I have huge concerns. We have all litigated back and forth, 
causation on SVB. But one of the things that happened, when you 
get $40-plus billion coming out of an institution in 6 hours, 
driven by an internet-based run, I do not know what regulatory 
framework prevents that. And while I was glad that the SEC, 
Chair Gensler, put out a commentary that is saying we do need 
to take a look at more transparency on short selling, you know, 
we have found in the past short selling borrowers themselves do 
not prevent some of this.
    One of the things that a New York Fed official mentioned is 
how do we get rid of the stigma of a bank going to the window? 
I mean, the thing is, rather than Fed being lender always of 
last resort, if we had that liquidity window that is available, 
banks are reluctant to use it. But in an era where people can 
move capital so quickly, having that liquidity tool available 
and not taking a huge amount of hits for using it would seem to 
me to be something that could at least take on this question of 
these internet-driven runs, which so far I have not heard from 
anybody on either side of the aisle a really good suggestion, 
including--I have thrown out a lot of suggestions, and frankly, 
after reflection, I am not sure make that much sense. But this 
liquidity tool of using the Fed discount window, is it a way to 
think about getting rid of the stigma, and maybe more of these 
policymakers ought to make that point as well.
    Could you address that, Mr. Chairman?
    Mr. Powell. It is critically important that people be able 
to use and willing to use the discount window and also the bank 
term funding facility, other facilities that we set up, and 
that they are not marked down by the markets for doing that.
    Senator Warner. Or marked down by the regulators, or the 
examiners.
    Mr. Powell. Yeah. But the concern is that markets will see 
this--and, you know, I would say the first thing is do no harm. 
Dodd-Frank provided disclosure of names and things like that, 
at a quicker pace. That is one of the reasons banks do not want 
to do this is they know their name is going to come out. I 
think whenever you look at changing that disclosure around use 
of these facilities you should be really considerate that you 
are going to make the stigma worse.
    I actually think it is good that banks have been willing to 
use the discount window and the new facility during this 
crisis, and it is almost like the stigma is a little bit less 
than it was. I want to think that anyway.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Warner.
    Senator Cortez Masto, of Nevada, is next, two Republicans 
in a row, so Senator Britt, you will be after Senator Cortez 
Masto, of Nevada.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman 
Powell, it is great to see you again. Thank you. I am very glad 
that yesterday, I think, Senator Warner mentioned this. We had 
a hearing for nominees to the Federal Reserve, and one of the 
nominees is the first Hispanic to sit on the Federal Reserve, 
Dr. Adriana Kugler, who has extensive experience economically, 
including congressionally confirmed positions. I am looking 
forward to supporting her confirmation as well.
    Let me talk to you a little bit about tougher lending 
standards that might be affecting inflation as interest rates 
increase. Yesterday, Raphael Bostic, President of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Atlanta, published a blog post nothing that the 
tightening bank lending standards we see are directly due to 
the Federal Reserve's higher interest rates. Do you think that 
the credit tightening we see from regional banks is acting as 
an effective substitute to an additional interest rate hike?
    Mr. Powell. It may be. We have been looking for that. We 
actually do not see a lot of evidence of additional tightening 
on top of what we had already been seeing yet, but we are 
keeping our eyes out for that.
    Senator Cortez Masto. And so then what are some risks that 
the FOMC continues to raise interest rates, despite seeing the 
impact of these rate increases already resulting in more credit 
tightening and higher housing costs? And we talked a little bit 
about this.
    Mr. Powell. You know, the reason we have slowed down, 
really since last December we slowed from 75 to 50 basis points 
per meeting to 25 at every meeting, and now, as we get closer 
and closer to what we believe will be--it is uncertain, but 
where we think our destination is--we have slowed down a little 
further. So we are trying to avoid the mistake of going too 
far. That is all it is. And as you can see, overwhelmingly, 
people on the committee do believe that it will be appropriate 
to raise hikes one or two additional times. A strong majority 
believes two times this year if the economy performs as 
expected.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. And so I am going to jump 
to employment, and this is something I talked about yesterday 
as well, because Nevada has a sort of workforce paradox. The 
most recent data shows that in Nevada, with both the biggest 
increase in job growth and the highest unemployment rate, I 
want to get your thoughts on moving forward as we address this 
concern, this paradox.
    Just let me give you an example. Nevada has the largest 
percent increase in employment, which was 4.2 percent. We also 
had the highest unemployment rate in the Nation in April at 5.4 
percent. That is 2 points above the national rate.
    As you consider the Federal Reserve's mandate to keep 
unemployment levels low, how do you consider States like 
Nevada, where there is that paradox?
    Mr. Powell. So only have the one Federal funds rate. We 
have to look at the national level, although we are well aware 
of different labor markets and also other interesting 
characteristics in Nevada.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Well, and we have talked about this 
because the labor market, particularly in the service industry, 
has been a drag, and we have seen that in Nevada, and you and I 
have talked about this as well. Is that something you consider 
as you look at the numbers, particularly in the service 
industry, and what are you seeing?
    Mr. Powell. We are seeing service industry is really where 
we still see labor shortages. We still have a very high number 
of job openings compared to the number of unemployed people. 
And I think even in Nevada you have got a job openings ratio to 
unemployed at 1.4 or something like that. That was unheard of 
before this period of time. And that just means there is still 
tremendous demand, and, of course, in Nevada it would largely 
be in the travel and entertainment sector, I would intuit.
    Senator Cortez Masto. And then talk about the housing data, 
if you would. This is another conversation we had, and how much 
of a drag that is on the economy as well, and what you are 
seeing.
    Mr. Powell. You know, housing is very interest-sensitive 
spending. Mortgage rates are very sensitive to our policies, 
and housing construction and housing sales and things like that 
are very sensitive to mortgage rates. So you saw housing 
activity move down pretty significantly when we started raising 
rates. You have actually seen it kind of hit a bottom now.
    We met with a housing group, manufacturers, housing 
builders, yesterday, and they say business is pretty good. It 
is largely new entrants, though. Many people have low-rate 
mortgages that they are not eager to get out of, so the sort of 
strength you see now is new buyers coming into the market. So 
the market seems to be improving. But again, it is among the 
most interest-sensitive spending, so it is going to be affected 
when we tighten policy.
    Senator Cortez Masto. OK. Thank you. I appreciate you being 
here.
    Chair Brown. Senator Britt, of Alabama, is recognized.
    Senator Britt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to start by 
acknowledging the strength of the U.S. banking sector. In 
recent events that unfolded related to SVB, Signature, and 
First Republic highlighted the significant consequences that 
could occur when bank execs prioritize profits over risk 
management, and also when banking regulators fail to do their 
job.
    Regulators left numerous red flags unaddressed, which 
allowed the inexcusable risk management practices at these 
banks to continue for as long as they did. Let us be clear. 
This inaction played a significant role in these banks' 
ultimate demise.
    However, the mismanagement and excessive risk-taking that 
occurred within these institutions are not representative of 
the broader banking sector. In fact, I think it is quite 
contrary. Banks across the board have proven to be resilient, 
well capitalized, and a source of strength in the global 
economy. In fact, I think you see that the U.S., comprised of 
banks of all sizes, is the world's most dynamic banking system.
    I am concerned, though, with impending actions of the 
Federal Reserve that that, in itself, will be jeopardized. If 
you look, community banks, for instance, have served our 
individuals in our small and rural communities across not only 
my great State of Alabama but across our entire country in ways 
that have allowed individuals and small businesses to actually 
be able to achieve the American Dream and to thrive.
    However, over the past decade we have seen a significant 
decline in the number of community banks serving Americans. The 
U.S. has lost 71 percent of total banks in the last four 
decades, and unfortunately smaller banks have made up a large 
portion of this. And just in the last decade, the number of 
community banks dropped by nearly 40 percent. That is 
completely and totally unacceptable. When we look at the vital 
role that they play in each and every one of our communities, 
we have to make sure that that strength is maintained and not 
undercut.
    In the face of these declining numbers, the Federal Reserve 
is considering proposals that could further contribute to the 
decrease in small- and mid-sized banks. Chair Powell, as the 
Fed is considering changes to the current banking regulatory 
framework, including stricter capital requirements that Vice 
Chair Barr has advocated for, how is the Federal Reserve 
evaluating the downstream impact of these on our smaller 
community banks?
    Mr. Powell. I think community banks, when we think of 
community banks, we think $10 billion and under in assets, 
mainly, but I do not think under $100 billion, I do not think 
that proposals under consideration are really applying to those 
banks. So it should not be a factor for smaller institutions, 
which, as you point out, have been declining in number for 30 
years.
    Senator Britt. So what do we do to support them? From your 
perspective, what is the Fed doing to support community banks 
and rural banks or creating conditions where they can thrive?
    Mr. Powell. There are these secular forces that are driving 
interstate banking and also just populating moving. You see 
rural areas that have lost half their population, things like 
that, so we cannot do much about that.
    But we understand that declining numbers of community banks 
is not a good thing for the country. The country is not better 
off for that happening. So we do not want to be part of the 
problem. Part of that can just be one fit size regulation, you 
know, high fixed costs, it will make especially small bank 
models unprofitable.
    So we very much try hard to not be part of the problem, and 
we do, as an institution, very much understand how important 
community banks are for the economy.
    Senator Britt. Can you speak to that? Can you tell me what 
role you believe community banks play that maybe other 
institutions cannot?
    Mr. Powell. Community banks are in their communities, so 
they know the community well, and they know the people in the 
community and the businesses in the community.
    Senator Britt. Relationship lenders.
    Mr. Powell. It is relationship lending, yeah. I told a 
story yesterday, which happened to me. We were moving to 
Washington and this big bank wanted to make the loan, and they 
decided not to make the loan at the last minute. I called the 
local community bank. The loan officer was somebody that knew 
my family, they knew the house, he went to my high school--he 
was much younger, of course--and they made the loan very 
quickly, and they just understood it. It was going to be a 
great loan. We paid it off long ago. So I understand personally 
that they are better at doing certain things.
    The big banks do certain things very well, but they do not 
do that very well. It is the smaller businesses.
    Senator Britt. Absolutely. And I just want your commitment 
that you will continue to take a look at whatever type of 
additional regulating or regulation tools that are kind of 
perceived to be helpful to maybe some of the bigger issues, 
that we take a look at how they affect downstream, how they 
affect small banks, mid-sized banks, and that we make sure that 
we create conditions where they can flourish.
    Mr. Powell. Yes. You very much have my commitment on that.
    Senator Britt. Thank you so much.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Britt. And rest assured, 
one of the--well, after yesterday maybe not--but one of the few 
things that both sides feel strongly and agree on here is that 
community banks play a major, major role in our financial 
system, and all of us support the community banks in our 
communities and know how important they are. So thank you for 
your comments.
    Senator Tester is recognized from his office.
    Senator Tester. Thank you, Chairman Brown, and thank you, 
Chair Powell, for being in front of the Committee. I appreciate 
you.
    Look, when I talk to Montanans I hear about what I think 
everybody in the Committee hears about. They hear about 
inflation, they hear about the high cost of housing, they hear 
about unaffordable childcare. And all these are economic 
conditions that impact hard-working families and small 
businesses in communities across my great State.
    And the examples are clear. Hospitals cannot hire nurses. 
Schools cannot hire teachers. And if they can hire them, there 
is no place to live. And even if they can find a place to live, 
then finding childcare is a problem, and then paying for that 
childcare is a problem too. Unfortunately, we have not done 
much about any of those, from a congressional standpoint, but I 
think all these challenges need to be addressed.
    But I am talking to the Chairman of the Fed, and so I ask 
the Chairman of the Fed, when we talk about these issues of 
inflation and housing and childcare--I know you guys think 
about inflation, but do you think about the other things, and 
do you have tools to address things like housing and childcare, 
or is that simply out of your purview?
    Mr. Powell. We enforce some of the consumer protection 
laws, so we can have an effect as that relates to fair lending 
and things like that. But ultimately the bigger question is 
just the availability of housing and its availability near 
where the jobs are. There is really nothing that our tools can 
do. The best thing we can do for those issues is to provide an 
economy where we have stable prices and maximum employment.
    Senator Tester. So there has been a lot of talk, and I am 
sure there have been a lot of questions asked on this Committee 
about interest rates. And I ask this not to influence you, 
because I do not believe you would be influenced by political 
forces. The worst thing that could happen is if the U.S. Senate 
is dictating monetary policy. We will leave that up to the pros 
like you.
    But interest rates continue to be an issue. You are fully 
aware that the debt deal that was struck clawed back unspent 
COVID dollars. You are familiar that there are some supply 
chain issues in this country that have impacts on inflation, 
as, I think, the COVID money will have some impacts. And there 
are some other things out there that I know you are looking at.
    So I am going to ask you a question that I am sure you have 
been asked already. What is going to be the key determinant as 
to whether you raise rates or leave them where they are at. I 
do not think dropping them would be appropriate, but what are 
the things you are looking at to make those kinds of decisions?
    Mr. Powell. Well, I would say that if we see the economy 
performing about as we expect, then two-thirds of the committee 
really thought it would be appropriate to raise rates a couple 
of times between now and the end of the year.
    So what do we expect? We expect continued modest growth. We 
expect continued gradual cooling off of the labor market, 
gradual better alignment of supply and demand. And we inspect 
inflation to be improving. So if all those things happen we 
think we are within a couple of rate hikes of the level we need 
to get to. We want to get to a level where we are confident 
that inflation is moving and will continue to move down to 2 
percent over time, and not a higher level, that level. So that 
is why we have slowed down here as we think we are getting 
close to that level.
    Senator Tester. OK. So let's think out past that. What 
factors are you going to look at that would determine a 
lowering in interest rates then?
    Mr. Powell. We do not see that happening any time soon, and 
the test for that is that we are confident that inflation is 
moving back down to our 2 percent goal. We want to have some 
confidence. And I will say in the Summary of Economic 
Projections that my participants and I filed last week, I think 
by the end of next year, by the end of 2024, the median 
participant did have some rate cuts. But that is going to 
depend on how the economy performs, and inflation has just 
consistently proven more persistent than we have expected, and 
that other forecasters have expected. So it is going to have to 
await a time when we are confident that inflation is moving 
down to 2 percent.
    Senator Tester. So I want to talk about regulation. I know 
it has been touched on. I know Senator Britt touched on it a 
little bit. And I know Michael Barr oversees the Fed's 
regulation actions. But when we passed 2155, the bill to give 
reg relief to small banks, in particular, there was a sentence 
in there about tailoring, so that even if you had a small 
community bank, if they had a risky portfolio, you could 
regulate them to match that risk, and bigger banks the same 
thing.
    Can you tell me what Barr is thinking or what you are 
advising him when it comes to--because I think we have all 
agreed, the Chairman just said, we want to protect community 
banks? They are not the problem out there. In fact, they are 
the ones that provide access to capital for these communities 
so they can grow and an economy can happen. Can you tell me 
what your interaction is with Barr when it comes to regulation 
and where you think he is going?
    Mr. Powell. Broadly speaking, regulations need to be voted 
on at the Board of Governors, and I am one of the people who 
votes. I am also chair of the committee. So that is the nature 
of the interaction.
    In terms of what you are really talking about, regulation 
for smaller institutions, I would say I think it is important 
that regulation be appropriate for an institution's size and 
risks. So it is not a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation, 
and the largest institutions need the highest capital standards 
and the most regulation, and as you get down to community banks 
the regulation supervision should reflect their size and risk.
    Senator Tester. I apologize, Mr. Chairman, for running 
over. Thank you, Chairman Powell.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Tester.
    Senator Cramer, of North Dakota, is recognized.
    Senator Cramer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman, and thank you, Chairman, for being here today.
    I know several of my Republican colleagues have been asking 
you about Basel III and the potential for some changes, 
obviously, in capital requirements. I am afraid part of what 
they are trying to do is fix a liquidity crisis at regional 
banks with a capital fix, which I do not think the two 
necessarily go hand in hand. In fact, it seems to me while you 
have been trying to engineer a soft landing, and now have taken 
a pause, and I am certainly not critical of that, I cannot 
fathom why the Fed would want to raise capital requirements 
when we could be facing what is a credit crunch. I mean, does 
that make sense to you, that in a potential credit crunch, 
caused somewhat by higher rates, obviously, somewhat by design, 
that it does not make sense to increase capital requirements 
for banks and individuals.
    Mr. Powell. I think that is always the tradeoff is higher 
capital means more stable, stronger banks that can last through 
bigger crises and things like that. But it is a continuum, 
because that also means slightly less capital being available 
and higher price of capital. And the thing with capital 
requirements is the answer is not 0 and it is not 100. You have 
got to find the right place.
    I would also say that the capital, in the form of what I 
have been briefed on, is a proposal where the big capital 
increases are really for the largest institutions and much less 
so for institutions that are not among the, particularly the 
eight GSIBs.
    Senator Cramer. But what is the motivation for that? I 
mean, you have just articulated the challenge, obviously, 
better than I did. But why, for example, the big institutions? 
What is the situation that would require that type of 
requirement?
    Mr. Powell. To your point, we spent many years raising 
capital and liquidity standards for the largest institutions, 
and appropriately so, I supported all of that and am glad that 
I did. I think it has been warranted, and I think that the 
large banks have competed very successfully with this high 
capital. And I think further increases are going to be on the 
table. We always thought there would be some further increase 
at the end of Basel III globally, but I think the increases are 
going to need to be justified.
    Senator Cramer. I am going to get to another question, but 
you said something a little earlier that I wanted to get to, in 
response to Senator Tester. Is your interaction with each other 
confined only to public meetings?
    Mr. Powell. Not at all. Not at all.
    Senator Cramer. Oh, OK. So you try to persuade each other 
at the water cooler.
    Mr. Powell. Yeah, I talk to all my colleagues a lot. I am 
not one of those people who can just sit in your office all 
day. I am popping up and running around. I am one of those 
people.
    Senator Cramer. OK. Well, in your interaction it sort of 
sounded like that, and I used to be on a three-member 
commission that regulated.
    Mr. Powell. We have very regular meetings and 
conversations, you know, right through the weekend, and we talk 
frequently.
    Senator Cramer. Sure. OK.
    In an earlier exchange with, I think it was Senator Tillis, 
you talked a little bit about digital economy challenges, and 
you were considering some changes to reflect how quickly 
individuals can move money. I think a lot of people would 
maintain that while you always need to have the foundation to 
weather the storm, so to speak, such as SVB, you might not even 
have a storm but for the fast ability for somebody to spark a 
run, for example, or to move money quickly.
    But you did not elaborate on what kind of changes you might 
be considering. Do you have some personal thoughts on it or 
things that you have been talking about as you are running 
around talking to each other?
    Mr. Powell. Yes. I am not the biggest expert on this.
    Senator Cramer. That is two of us.
    Mr. Powell. The thing that is clear is that our existing 
liquidity requirements, they did not assume, they did not take 
into contemplation at all the idea that you could have a run 
this fast. So there are things that are embedded in the net 
stable funding ratio and the liquidity coverage ratio that 
reflect an understanding of how fast a run happens. So that is 
why I think that regulatory response is going to be appropriate 
here, not just supervisory.
    In addition, you would have thought, and we thought--and by 
the way, the board is every bit as accountable as the San 
Francisco Fed on this--that supervision could have been much 
more forward leaning on the liquidity issue than it was. So we 
are going to address that too.
    Senator Cramer. Great point, because these guys have heard 
me use my soccer referee illustration. If you warned the 
offender over and over and over but never throw up a card, they 
just offend worse the next time. So I think that is an obvious 
finding, and I would concur with you.
    But the whole issue of the run itself is also problematic, 
while not maybe directly jurisdictional to any one regulator, 
as policymakers and regulators together we should find a better 
solution.
    Thank you again for your service and for being here. Thank 
you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Cramer.
    Senator Warren, from Massachusetts, is recognized.
    Senator Warren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    So in 2010, Congress passed Dodd-Frank to make banking 
regulations tougher and to avoid future bank collapses. And 
very soon after that bank CEOs started lobbying for weaker 
rules. Now Chair Powell, you also lobbied for weaker rules.
    When President Trump first nominated you as Federal Chair 
in 2017, you testified, actually in this very room, I think, 
that you intended to, quote, ``consider appropriate ways to 
ease regulatory burdens for the banks.'' And when I asked you 
if there were any rules, any rules at all, that you thought 
ought to be made stronger, do you remember what you said?
    Mr. Powell. I think I pointed to the net stable funding 
ratio.
    Senator Warren. No. Actually, that is not what you said. 
You said, ``Honestly, Senator, I think they are tough enough.'' 
You could not point to anything you thought should be tougher.
    Mr. Powell. In the event we strengthened the net stable 
funding.
    Senator Warren. Well, in 2018, you supported Congress' 
weakening of those rules. You led the Fed in hacking away at 
one rule after another. According to the Fed's own analysis of 
the Silicon Valley Bank failure you weakened the rules in 
multiple ways, you reduced capital requirements, you weakened 
liquidity risk management, you skipped out on using enhanced 
stress testing for banks with tens of billions of dollars in 
assets, and more. And the result was that the second-, third-, 
and fourth-largest bank failures in U.S. history, which 
together required $23 billion in bailout money.
    In fact, you now hold the record, in a single year the FDIC 
has been forced to rescue more giant failed banks on your watch 
than any Fed chair in American history.
    Chair Powell, do you agree with Vice Chair Barr's 
conclusion that the Fed bears a big share of the responsibility 
for the failure of SVB?
    Mr. Powell. I certainly think that our supervision has been 
shown to have been lax in not being assertive enough. I think 
that the supervisors saw the right issues but were not forceful 
enough, in hindsight. And I think that is certainly a fair 
conclusion.
    Senator Warren. OK. So those regulations were weakened. 
Those supervisors were clearly asleep at the switch for more 
than 5 years under your watch. And I will just say it again. 
This is exactly why I opposed your nomination in 2017. The 
decisions that you made, the votes that you took, and the 
things that you said helped cause this mess. And when you were 
up for reappointment in 2021, I opposed your confirmation 
because I believed that your continued leadership would be 
dangerous to our financial system. And the Fed's own report 
confirms that.
    So yesterday, Chair Powell, this Committee voted on a bill 
to help hold CEOs accountable when their actions blow up banks. 
At the Fed, you are the one who lobbied, who drafted, and who 
voted for weaker rules, and you were ultimately responsible for 
the team of Fed supervisors who fell down on the job.
    Do you take responsibility for your role in these bank 
failures?
    Mr. Powell. So I think we learned some lessons from the 
bank failures, and the main responsibility I take is to learn 
the right lessons from this and to undertake to address them so 
we do not have a situation like this where we had, 
unexpectedly, a large bank fail and spread contagion into the 
banking system. That is not supposed to happen, and we need to 
take appropriate steps to make sure it does not happen again.
    Senator Warren. So I just want to make sure I understand 
what you mean when you say you take responsibility. Do you take 
responsibility for your actions that led to the failures of 
these banks?
    Mr. Powell. Yeah, I think the question of what happened--
supervision was at fault. That is both at the board and at the 
Reserve banks.
    Senator Warren. And are you ultimately responsible for 
those supervisors? Are you in charge here?
    Mr. Powell. Under the law, the Vice Chair for Supervision 
is----
    Senator Warren. OK. So you take no----
    Mr. Powell. ----has sole authority.
    Senator Warren. So you take no responsibility on this.
    Mr. Powell. I did not say that.
    Senator Warren. Well, that is what I am trying to ask.
    Mr. Powell. That is not what I said.
    Senator Warren. I am trying to understand what you take 
responsibility for.
    Mr. Powell. I take responsibility for addressing the 
situation appropriately. That is my focus.
    Senator Warren. That is talking about going forward.
    Mr. Powell. That is my focus, is going forward.
    Senator Warren. Yeah, well, that kind of sounds like not 
taking responsibility for what you have done in the past.
    You know, a month ago we had the CEOs of the banks that 
exploded in here, and each of them had scooped up huge bonuses, 
and each of them said they planned to keep every penny of that 
money. And now we have the Chair of the Federal Reserve, who 
led the charge to weaken bank regulations, who oversaw the bank 
supervisors who failed miserably to hold these banks in line, 
and again, the accountability is zero.
    Our banking system is broken. Twenty-three billion dollars 
in bailout money and there is no accountability for those at 
the top. And once again, the people who did not cause the mess 
are forced to clean it up. We need significant changes here.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Warren.
    There are two Senators who might be online. Senator Sinema 
is recognized, from Arizona, if she is online. If not, Senator 
Warnock, from Georgia, if he is online.
    OK. We will close the hearing.
    Today we have come together to discuss how the economy 
ought to be. I do not believe that to have a strong economy was 
we must trade American jobs for corporate profits, nor do I 
believe we must sacrifice a safe and resilient banking system 
for each money for the biggest banks. We can fight inflation 
and protect worker gains by investing in growth right here at 
home and building a more inclusive economy.
    Thank you for joining us, Chair Powell, today. I look 
forward to working with you to strengthen our economy.
    For Senators who wish to submit questions, they are due 1 
week from today, Thursday, June 29th. For Chair Powell, please 
submit responses to questions for the record 45 days from the 
day you receive them.
    Senator Scott has some comments he would like to make.
    Senator Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just to be quick, 
one of the comments that I heard during the hearing was that 
somehow tax cuts led to the challenges that we are facing with 
our debt. I just wanted to clarify the record that revenue in 
2022 was $4.9 trillion, more than 30 percent higher than 2017, 
revenue of $3.32 trillion.
    One of the things we should just recognize as a clear fact 
is that if your revenue goes up, and that is what happened 
after the TCJA in 2018 and 2019, we had an increase in revenue, 
not a decrease in revenue. Unfortunately, we had an increase in 
spending that exceeded the increase in revenue. So if you spend 
more money than you take in, you still end up with a deficit.
    Chair Brown. Thank you. Of course, Senator Scott recognizes 
that we had a pandemic.
    The Committee is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

additional material supplied for the record follow:]
               PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIR SHERROD BROWN
    I call this hearing to order. Welcome back, Chair Powell.
    For the economy to truly deliver security and opportunity for 
American workers, we need plentiful job opportunities, we need high 
wages, and we need low prices.
    Prices are the current problem. But it's been decades since workers 
have had all three at once.
    No matter what goes wrong in the economy--whether it's a financial 
crisis or bank failures, whether it's supply chain turmoil or energy 
market disruption--working people always pay the price.
    Meanwhile, corporations somehow always find a way to increase their 
profits. They always find a way.
    Financial crisis? Profits go up.
    Mass unemployment? Profits go up.
    Global pandemic? Profits go up.
    War in Europe? Profits go up.
    Increasing energy costs? Profits go up.
    When supply chains ground to a halt and Putin invaded Ukraine and 
the economy reopened and demand surged everywhere, all at once, the 
rest of us saw problems to solve. But in many corporate boardrooms, 
executives saw an opportunity.
    For the largest multinational corporations, inflation has been a 
perfect excuse to increase profits by raising prices far beyond the 
costs of their inputs.
    And the main tool that many in this town look toward to rescue us 
from inflation--hiking interest rates--can do little to solve that 
problem.
    It's little wonder, then, that when American workers see the high 
prices at the grocery store and the pharmacy counter and the gas pump--
along with rising borrowing cost for mortgages and car loans and credit 
cards--they remain skeptical of Government and its willingness to 
address the challenges people face.
    Inflation is a complex problem, and the Fed has been fighting it 
with a blunt tool.
    And we have made progress.
    Inflation is at the lowest level in the last 2 years--giving hope 
that the price of consumer goods will continue to decline.
    And despite the experts' predictions, job growth remains strong. 
The country added 339,000 new jobs in May. Ohio's unemployment rate--
3.6 percent--is the State's lowest in 20 years. Unemployment for Black 
and Brown Americans remains near historic lows.
    Think about what that actually means for workers in Ohio and South 
Carolina and all over the country.
    It means Americans have more opportunity and choice in in their 
lives--even in places that haven't seen a lot of options in recent 
years. It means people have the power to demand raises, and retirement 
security, and paid sick days, and control over their schedules.
    It means more Americans have the dignity of work that comes with a 
good job that provides for your family.
    And look where that kind of power for workers is taking us. Last 
month, wage growth outpaced inflation. That's the way it should be.
    Today's hearing comes at a critical time.
    Last week, the Fed decided to pause interest rates hikes after ten 
consecutive increases, and maintain the rate at its current level.
    For the many of us who are concerned that further rate hikes could 
do more harm than good, this is welcome news.
    The challenge you face, Chair Powell, is to ensure that workers 
continue to see higher wages, while also continuing to rein in 
inflation.
    In previous hearings, you have noted with justifiable pride how 
careful management of the economy helped millions of workers return to 
the job market.
    It's those workers who stand to lose the most if the Fed overdoes 
its rate hikes, loses sight of the dual mandate, and drives the 
unemployment rate back up.
    As you have also noted, Chair Powell, increasing interest rates is 
not the only tool we have to fight inflation. And the Fed is not the 
only one with a role to play.
    Congress, the Administration, everyone in Government--and in 
corporate board rooms--must do their part.
    There is no reason we cannot continue coming together to bring 
prices down.
    More policymakers are finally recognizing what those of us in Ohio 
have known for years--that outsourcing the production of pretty much 
everything may mean higher profits in the short-term, but it will not 
lead to a resilient economy with a strong middle class in the long-
term.
    We have taken steps to strengthen our supply chains and bring 
critical manufacturing back to the U.S., with the CHIPS Act and the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
    We must continue that progress.
    Instead of lowering demand--which is just economics textbook jargon 
for making people poorer, laying off workers, denying raises--we can 
produce more, we can build more, and we can grow the economy from the 
middle out.
    This is also our first semiannual report from the Fed since the 
string of large bank failures this spring.
    Those failures were caused by the same issue at the heart of so 
many of our economic problems: it's the Wall Street business model.
    Executives put short-term increases in quarterly profits--and their 
own compensation--above everything and everyone else.
    At SVB and Signature Bank, those in charge pushed their banks to 
grow too big, too fast. They made risky bets. And they got massive 
payouts--executives were paying themselves bonuses right up until the 
moment their banks crashed.
    To most Americans, that's not surprising.
    People have gotten all too used to big bankers treating the 
industry more like a game, or an endless ATM for themselves, secure in 
the knowledge they won't pay any real price if things go wrong.
    Chair Powell, I look forward to hearing today how the Fed will 
protect American workers in the fight against inflation, and promote an 
economy with a strong, growing middle class.
                                 ______
                                 
                PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR TIM SCOTT
    Chair Powell, thanks for joining us today, such an important time. 
Your last appearance before this Committee was about 4 months ago, just 
days before the collapse of two banks. And while we continue to 
investigate those bank failures, it's important to examine the macro 
factors, such as rising interest rates, that contributed to the bank 
failures and the current economic stresses American families face every 
single day.
    Looking through those lenses, I want to turn to you in your role as 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve, a role that requires constant scrutiny 
because the American people deserve nothing less than the best we can 
offer them: the greatest opportunity to succeed, and the strongest 
tools to pave their path.
    Unfortunately, the bank failures earlier this year shook confidence 
in our financial system, but thankfully, our healthy and well-managed 
institutions stepped up and we have been able to weather the storm. 
However, I have been consistently disappointed in your deputy, Vice 
Chair of Supervision, Michael Barr. Just yesterday, this Committee 
passed, as Chairman Brown just said, near-unanimous legislation to 
encourage good corporate governance. But not just that. We also wanted 
to focus on the supervisory failure that was a part of the legislation.
    Those are not the same actions taken by Michael Barr. I asked him 
twice when he was here before the Committee if he would fire bad bank 
supervisors for the supervisory neglect that contributed to the epic 
failures of SVB and Signature. He would not commit to doing anything. 
And I would ask you, in your role as the ``active executive officer,'' 
if you would take some action, firing those responsible for missing 
what was glaringly obvious, known to all of America, certainly should 
have been obvious to the supervisors.
    I've said from the beginning that this has been a failure in three 
parts--SVB and Signature. It was a failure of the bank execs. The 
actions that we took 21 to 2 yesterday [reinforce] Congress is willing 
to take the lead and hold bank executives accountable.
    Second failure was a supervisory failure, and that requires the Fed 
to hold folks accountable, just like Congress did. And third, the Biden 
inflationary economy that has [driven] prices really high and resulted 
in ten rate increases from you all. In the wake of Silicon Valley 
Bank's downfall, as the Vice Chair released his report on the failures, 
we heard directly from you that your role was to ``announce it,'' to 
``get briefed on it,'' but not necessarily to be ``involved in the work 
of it.''
    So my question is, as you watch Vice Chair Barr roll out higher 
capital standards, it seems like your very clear statements are that 
you will be supporting as well as working to implement Vice Chair 
Barr's recommendations. But as you know, that the other members of the 
Board and Governor Bowman has recently said that Mr. Barr wrote a 
report on Silicon Valley Bank's failure that provided ``his 
conclusions'' and went on to state that the report should be used ``to 
help guide discussions among policymakers,'' not necessarily just the 
rush towards implementation of Vice Chair Barr's recommendations.
    I'd love to hear your thoughts on that path forward if, in fact, 
your job is to rubber-stamp the decisions of Vice Chair Barr, or is 
your responsibility to take into consideration the Vice Chair's 
recommendations and then chart a path that seems to be consistent with 
what is in the best interest of our Nation and frankly, of our 
financial institutions.
    I do not believe that increasing significantly the capital 
standards is in the best interest of small businesses or people looking 
for loans. The more capital we put on the sidelines, the less capital 
there is for us to see our financial institutions loaning the money 
out. I look forward to continuing our discussion during the question 
and answer time.
                                 ______
                                 
                 PREPARED STATEMENT OF JEROME H. POWELL
        Chair, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
                             June 22, 2023
    Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and other Members of the 
Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal 
Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report.
    We at the Fed remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to 
promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. 
My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is 
causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back 
down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of 
the Federal Reserve, and without it, the economy does not work for 
anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a 
sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.
    I will review the current economic situation before turning to 
monetary policy.
Current Economic Situation and Outlook
    The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, and recent 
indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a 
modest pace. Although growth in consumer spending has picked up this 
year, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting 
higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth 
also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
    The labor market remains very tight. Over the first 5 months of the 
year, job gains averaged a robust 314,000 jobs per month. The 
unemployment rate moved up but remained low in May, at 3.7 percent. 
There are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are 
coming into better balance. The labor force participation rate has 
moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54. 
Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies 
have declined so far this year. While the jobs-to-workers gap has 
narrowed, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of 
available workers. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \1\ A box in our latest Monetary Policy Report, ``Developments in 
Employment and Earnings across Demographic Groups'', discusses 
differences in labor market outcomes among segments of the population.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over 
the 12 months ending in April, total personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) prices rose 4.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy 
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent. In May, the 12-month 
change in the consumer price index (CPI) came in at 4.0 percent, and 
the change in the core CPI was 5.3 percent. Inflation has moderated 
somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, inflation 
pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation 
back down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated 
inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well 
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, 
businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial 
markets.
Monetary Policy
    With inflation remaining well above our longer-run goal of 2 
percent and with labor market conditions remaining tight, the Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of 
monetary policy. We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 
percentage points since early last year and have continued to reduce 
our securities holdings at a brisk pace. \2\ We have been seeing the 
effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate-
sensitive sectors of the economy. It will take time, however, for the 
full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on 
inflation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \2\ A box in our latest Monetary Policy Report, ``Developments in 
the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet and Money Markets'', discusses 
changes in the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for 
households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic 
activity, hiring, and inflation. \3\ The extent of these effects 
remains uncertain.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \3\ For a discussion of bank credit availability, see the box 
``Recent Developments in Bank Lending Conditions'' in the latest 
Monetary Policy Report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the 
uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and 
potential headwinds from credit tightening, the FOMC decided last week 
to maintain the target range for the Federal funds rate at 5 to 5\1/4\ 
percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our 
securities holdings. Nearly all FOMC participants expect that it will 
be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of 
the year. But at last week's meeting, considering how far and how fast 
we have moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range steady to 
allow the Committee to assess additional information and its 
implications for monetary policy. In determining the extent of 
additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation 
to 2 percent over time, we will take into account the cumulative 
tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy 
affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial 
developments. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by 
meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications 
for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the 
balance of risks.
    We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 
percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well 
anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-
trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring 
price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum 
employment and stable prices over the longer run.
    Before concluding, let me briefly address the condition of the 
banking sector. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. As 
detailed in the box on financial stability in the June Monetary Policy 
Report, the Federal Reserve, together with the Treasury Department and 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, took decisive action in 
March to protect the U.S. economy and to strengthen public confidence 
in our banking system. The recent bank failures, including the failure 
of Silicon Valley Bank, and the resulting banking stress have 
highlighted the importance of ensuring we have the appropriate rules 
and supervisory practices for banks of this size. We are committed to 
addressing these vulnerabilities to make for a stronger and more 
resilient banking system.
    We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our 
public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our 
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.
    Thank you. I am happy to take your questions.
         RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF CHAIR BROWN
                     FROM JEROME H. POWELL

Q.1. In addition to creating two-thirds of all net new jobs in 
the United States, small businesses account for nearly half of 
the Nation's gross domestic product. \1\ Despite small 
businesses' integral role in the U.S. economy as job creators, 
most small businesses have less than 2 weeks total cash 
reserves. \2\ Access to capital is essential to these 
businesses' survival and supports a more competitive and 
diverse economy. Small and medium banks, which may have greater 
exposure to interest rate risks, are where small businesses 
turn to when they need financing. Tightening credit conditions 
will be a top concern for small businesses in need of capital.

communities
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In today's economy, where many of the smallest of the small 
businesses lack the capital necessary to grow their businesses, 
what steps is the Fed taking to monitor the impact of 
tightening credit conditions on small business financing 
conditions?

A.1. Federal Reserve staff closely examine the most recent 
available data on small businesses to assess credit conditions 
prior to every Federal Open Market Committee meeting. This 
includes information on recent borrowing experiences and 
expectations from surveys of businesses, as well as information 
on credit standards and demand from surveys of banks.
    Recognizing the important role that small businesses play 
in the U.S. economy and how important small banks are to these 
businesses, in 2017 the Federal Reserve System began conducting 
its Small Business Lending Survey, a quarterly survey of banks 
that collects quantitative and qualitative information about 
credit market conditions for small businesses. The survey 
collects data that are not otherwise available about small 
business lending, including loan amounts, interest rates, 
maturities, and lending terms for several different types of 
commercial and industrial loans to small businesses. Moreover, 
the relatively high frequency of the survey allows policymakers 
and others to understand how lending conditions are changing 
with relatively little time lag. This survey serves as a useful 
complement to the more qualitative information collected in the 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on bank lending, which is 
also conducted by the Federal Reserve.
    In addition, the Federal Reserve System collects and 
disseminates information on small business credit from the 
vantage point of small businesses. The annual Small Business 
Credit Survey (SBCS) is a national survey that gathers 
information from small businesses on their financial 
performance, credit needs, and borrowing experiences. \3\ The 
SBCS, conducted since 2016, provides perspectives on business 
conditions and insights on financing trends--including 
outcomes, satisfaction, and challenges with both bank and 
nonbank lenders. SBCS publications on both employer and 
nonemployer firms, as well as periodic reporting on firms owned 
by people of color, women-owned firms, rural firms, and 
startups, have been important to strengthening the collective 
understanding of differences in business conditions and 
financing experiences across firm segments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \3\ The SBCS is a survey administered by the 12 Federal Reserve 
Banks annually and surveys firms with fewer than 500 employees from a 
nationwide convenience sample of small businesses--that is, the sample 
is taken from a group of people who are easy to contact or to reach 
rather than from drawing a statistically representative sample. The 
2022 SBCS was fielded in the fall of 2022, and the 2023 survey is 
currently open. A description of the methodology and full set of 
reports are available at https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/.

Q.2. Please discuss the Fed's analysis of how higher credit 
costs might be more straining for small businesses than 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
inflation, at its present rate?

A.2. Small businesses do generally have much smaller cash 
reserves than larger businesses and thus are more vulnerable to 
increases in interest payments. For instance, among employer 
firms in the 2022 SBCS with less than $1 million in annual 
revenues, 37 percent cited making payments on debt as a 
financial challenge (compared to 20 percent of firms with more 
than $1 million in revenues). Moreover, data from the Federal 
Reserve's Small Business Lending Survey point to continued 
increases in interest rates on loans to small businesses by 
banks since the 2022 SBCS was fielded. This has likely further 
increased the difficulties caused by debt. Consistent with 
this, small business loan delinquency rates have risen notably 
in recent months. While the level of delinquency rates is only 
slightly elevated relative to historical levels, a prolonged 
period of higher credit costs could push delinquency rates 
higher still.
    However, there are reasons to believe that the effects of 
higher credit costs might be less pronounced than the effects 
of inflation. Available data suggest that, in part due to 
Government support during the pandemic, small business balance 
sheets were strong relative to prepandemic norms. Moreover, 
U.S. Census survey data suggest that small businesses, 
particularly the smallest businesses, seek new financing less 
often than their larger counterparts and carry smaller amounts 
of debt. These factors likely contribute to the finding in the 
2022 SBCS that 81 percent of employer firms cited inflation as 
a challenge for their business as compared to 32 percent 
reporting challenges with debt payments and interest rates.

Q.3. When you appeared before the Committee last June, you 
noted that supply and demand needed to come back into alignment 
to help moderate prices in the housing market. You also noted 
that the Federal Reserve's primary tool--interest rates--affect 
demand in the housing market, but that the housing market also 
suffers from a lack of housing supply and conditions, including 
land use restrictions and labor shortages, that have 
contributed to a lack of housing supply.
    How would the development of new housing supply, 
particularly housing affordable to low-income individuals and 
families, affect housing prices and housing's contribution to 
inflation calculations?

A.3. The addition of new housing supply can help to reduce 
upward pressure on house prices and rents. Recent academic 
research suggests that new market-rate construction can help to 
increase supply throughout a local housing market, as people 
moving into the new housing will open up vacancies in other 
neighborhoods. \4\ Other research has found that the 
construction of affordable housing in higher-income 
neighborhoods reduces house prices and attracts lower-income 
households. \5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \4\ Evan Mast, Journal of Urban Economics, January 2023.
     \5\ Rebecca Diamond and Tim McQuade, Journal of Political Economy 
2019.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Housing's contribution to consumer price inflation is based 
on rental data. By reducing upward pressure on rents, the 
addition of new housing supply can reduce this component of 
inflation.

Q.4. I am pleased to see that FedNow will go live this July. 
Introducing another public option to the payments system will 
provide immense benefits to consumers, businesses, and the 
financial services industry. As more transactions are conducted 
through real-time payment services and digital wallets, the 
speed and irrevocability of transactions creates greater 
security and fraud challenges. What preventative measures can 
the Fed and other financial regulators take to protect 
consumers given the security challenges posed by these new 
payment systems?

A.4. The Federal Reserve is aware that fraud is a persistent 
threat across all types of payment transactions. The Federal 
Reserve takes seriously issues associated with consumer fraud, 
and we are committed to working with the industry to help with 
awareness and education about fraud scams and advancing the 
safety of payment services broadly.
    The FedNow Service has features and terms to help 
participating banks and credit unions (participants) with fraud 
risk management that we will continue to enhance as the service 
develops. The features and terms include tools that allow 
participants to reject payments to and from suspicious accounts 
they have designated, and service terms supplementing the 
regulatory framework that will help participants conduct 
investigations in connection with fraud and errors. Combating 
fraud is an ongoing endeavor for the industry as a whole, and 
we will continue to enhance the FedNow Service and collaborate 
with stakeholders to strengthen our collective defenses and 
help protect consumers from evolving fraud threats.

Q.5. I understand that the Fed and other agencies are working 
on how to implement the Basel III capital standards and the Fed 
is conducting a holistic review of capital regulation. As you 
stated in your responses to questions for the record in March 
2023, robust capital requirements are fundamental to the 
strength and stability of our financial system, and the Federal 
Reserve's framework includes both risk-based and leverage 
capital standards.
    A strong leverage capital requirement is an important 
backstop to the bank capital framework. Excluding unrealized 
losses on banks' certain debt securities, including Treasuries, 
can give a false sense of a bank's true capital position, as 
the failure of Silicon Valley Bank demonstrated. Will you 
commit to strengthening the supplementary leverage ratio to 
ensure that banks maintain a cushion against potential losses 
and can continue to serve small businesses and households 
during periods of financial stress?

A.5. Leverage capital requirements serve an important role in 
our capital framework as a transparent measure of bank 
resilience and a credible, risk-insensitive backstop and 
complement to our risk-based capital requirements. Generally, 
we want risk-based capital to be the binding capital 
constraint, with the leverage ratio as a backup. The Federal 
Reserve Board (Board) recently issued a proposal to implement 
the final components of the Basel III agreement, also known as 
the Basel III endgame. The proposal would affect leverage 
capital requirements in two ways. First, the proposal would 
require all large banks with $100 billion or more in assets to 
include unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale 
securities in their capital ratios. This change would affect 
the measure of regulatory capital in the numerator of both the 
risk-based capital ratios and the leverage ratios for these 
firms. Second, the proposal includes extending application of 
the supplementary leverage ratio to all large banks with assets 
of $100 billion or more. This change would align leverage 
capital requirements across large banks.
    I look forward to reviewing comments from the public on 
these and all aspects of the proposed rule. The Board will take 
those comments into account when finalizing the proposal. As I 
noted in my remarks at the July 27 Board meeting, it will be 
important to strike the right balance between the benefits and 
costs of higher capital.

Q.6. Vice Chair Barr stated that the experience with Silicon 
Valley Bank has ``emphasized why strong bank capital matters. 
While the proximate cause of SVB's failure was a liquidity run, 
the underlying issue was concern about its solvency.'' As you 
also testified, Silicon Valley Bank had ``a capital issue. They 
were trying to raise capital.'' What lessons has the Fed 
learned from the SVB failure about how to improve capital 
requirements? How will the Fed incorporate those factors as 
they review and update capital requirements for large banks?

A.6. A robust and dynamic banking system, along with effective 
and efficient regulation and supervision, helps to ensure that 
banks of all sizes can meet the needs of households and 
businesses in every community throughout our country, in good 
times and in bad. We must preserve and build upon these 
strengths and that diversity.
    High levels of capital are essential to enable banks to 
continue to lend to households and businesses and conduct 
financial intermediation, even in times of severe stress. But 
raising capital requirements also increases the cost of, and 
reduces access to, credit. While there could be benefits of 
still higher capital, as always, we must also consider the 
potential costs. This is a difficult balance to strike and 
striking it will require public input and thoughtful 
deliberation.

Q.7. Strong cybersecurity measures at banks of all sizes are 
important to maintaining financial stability. What is the Fed 
doing to ensure that banks are protecting their depositors 
against cyberattacks and other cyberthreats?

A.7. Cybersecurity of the financial system is a high priority 
for the Federal Reserve. There are significant benefits to 
coordinating closely on these matters with our State and 
Federal counterparts, as well as with private organizations 
working to strengthen the security of the financial sector. As 
discussed in greater detail in the Board's Cybersecurity and 
Financial System Resilience Report to Congress, \6\ we focus on 
cybersecurity risks and the operational resilience of financial 
institutions and the broader financial system through 
supervision, regulation, and intra-governmental coordination.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \6\ See https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/
cybersecurity-report-202308.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Federal Reserve examiners regularly conduct examinations 
and monitoring of cyber risk management, governance, and 
controls at supervised institutions. Supervision activities in 
this area promote the resilience of the financial system to 
protect against cyber incidents and other hazards, safeguard 
critical infrastructure, and address emerging technology risks.
    The Board also issues and publishes rules and guidance for 
supervised institutions regarding IT, cybersecurity, 
operational resilience, and other related topics. \7\ The Board 
and other regulatory agencies also publish interagency guidance 
on various aspects of information security risk within the 
financial services sector. For example, in November 2021, the 
Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency jointly issued a final rule on 
computer-security incident notification requirements for 
banking organizations and their bank service providers. \8\ The 
requirements in the final rule are intended to promote early 
awareness of emerging threats to banking organizations and the 
broader financial system.

        RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SCOTT
                     FROM JEROME H. POWELL

Q.1. In April, the Financial Stability Oversight Council 
(FSOC), proposed guidance on a framework to evaluate nonbank 
financial firms for designation as a threat to financial 
stability. This follows along on a recent rewrite of the 
guidance in 2019. Can you explain why you supported the 2019 
proposal and are now supporting the new proposal which seeks to 
undo many of the key portions of the 2019 proposal?

A.1. In 2019, I supported the emphasis on an activities-based 
approach but noted that nonbank designations remained an 
important tool. The Financial Stability Oversight Council 
(FSOC) now has over a decade of experience since the enactment 
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act, and it is natural to revisit its approach to designation 
in light of lessons learned over that time. Further, it is 
appropriate for the FSOC to regularly assess its toolkit and 
consider how best to use its tools to respond to systemic 
risks, whether the risk arises from an activity, event, or 
firm.

Q.2. After you became Chair of the Federal Reserve and while 
Governor Quarles was Vice Chair for Supervision, the Federal 
Reserve Board held eight open board meetings to discuss 
proposed rules. This included an open meeting to discuss a 
proposed rulemaking on proprietary trading, a final rule 
establishing single-counterparty credit limits, a proposed 
rulemaking to tailor prudential standards, final rules to 
tailor prudential standards to large banking organizations, and 
a proposed rulemaking on the Community Reinvestment Act.
    Given the significant implications to the U.S. economy of 
any proposals implementing components of the Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision, will you commit to conducting an open 
board meeting for any such proposed rulemakings?
    If no, why not?
    Will you also commit to carefully considering and 
discussing any recommendations brought to the full board and 
incorporating the views of other governors in the proposal?
    If no, why not?

A.2. It has been the historic practice of the Federal Reserve 
Board (Board) to hold open Board meetings for significant 
rulemakings. Continuing that practice, the Board held an open 
Board meeting on July 27, 2023, to consider the Basel III 
Endgame proposal.
    I believe it is important to seek consensus, and as a 
general matter, I regularly discuss matters that may come 
before the Board with other Board members. Soliciting input is 
a critical part of our process, especially when we consider any 
significant matter, such as changes to our regulatory 
framework. Ultimately, Board members consider proposals before 
the Board using their own independent judgment.

Q.3. In the last year, the SEC issued a proposed rulemaking 
that could upend bank custody services by forcing a change in 
how customer deposits are treated and has proposed additional 
rules that could wreak havoc in bank credit and securities 
markets. Why is the Federal Reserve allowing the SEC to proceed 
with proposed rulemaking of the banking industry without the 
Federal Reserve's involvement?

A.3. The Federal Reserve is aware of the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission's (SEC) proposal related to safeguarding 
customer assets and its proposed cash segregation requirement 
for client funds of registered investment advisers. The 
proposed rule would, if adopted, require a significant change 
in custody practices at depository institutions. The Federal 
Reserve has been in contact with the SEC regarding the proposed 
rule to share our views and technical knowledge. Ultimate 
rulemaking authority under the Federal securities laws, 
however, rests with the SEC.

Q.4. In a speech on June 17, the General Counsel of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) confirmed public speculation 
that one of the motivating factors behind the Fed's use of 
emergency 13(3) authorities in establishing the Bank Term 
Funding Program (BTFP) was a desire to extend the maximum loan 
period to 1 year, beyond the 4-month loan terms offered by the 
discount window. \1\ However, discount window loans are 
renewable which can allow borrowers to, in practice, extend 
loans to 1 year or longer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \1\ https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2023/ost230617
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Accepting collateral at par was also stated as an 
additional reason for this 13(3) facility. However, in a 
footnote it is noted that discount window lending requires 
loans to be ``secured to the satisfaction of [the lending] 
Federal Reserve bank.'' This would imply that the Fed could 
have simply adjusted the discount window to value collateral at 
par through 10(b) authorities.
    In light of this, can you explain why the use of 13(3) 
authorities were necessary?

A.4. The Board designed the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) to 
support American businesses and households by making additional 
funding available to eligible depository institutions to help 
ensure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their 
depositors. The Board determined that in order for the BTFP to 
be effective, it needed to be designed to (i) provide a stable, 
medium-term source of funding and (ii) address the stresses of 
banks that had high unrealized losses on their long-term 
securities portfolios. Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act 
(FRA) provided more flexibility to meet these needs than 
discount window lending, which is extended under section 10B of 
the FRA. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \2\ On January 24, 2024, the Board announced that the BTFP will 
cease making new loans as scheduled on March 11, 2024. The program will 
continue to make loans until that time and is available as an 
additional source of liquidity for eligible institutions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As you note, discount window lending generally has a 
maximum term of 90 days and is statutorily limited in most 
cases to no longer than 4 months under section 10B of the FRA. 
While it is true that discount window loans can generally be 
rolled over to the extent that the borrower remains eligible to 
initiate new borrowings, the lack of assurance that credit 
would be re-extended could create uncertainty that would 
undermine the goal of providing stable, medium-term funding, 
especially in unusual and exigent circumstances. Our assessment 
was that additional forms of short-term (e.g., 90-day) funding 
from the Federal Reserve might not ameliorate the uncertainty 
around bank funding stability during a period of intense 
deposit withdrawals. Thus, we settled on extending advances of 
up to 1 year to provide funding certainty and stability in 
reliance on section 13(3) of the FRA.
    In addition, to increase the amount of liquidity available 
to the banking system, the facility extends funds against the 
full book value of securities. The Federal Reserve's discount 
window normally lends at a haircut to the market value of 
collateral to assure that the Reserve Banks are secured to 
their satisfaction. To address the risks to the Federal Reserve 
from lending against the book value of collateral when the 
market value of the collateral was below book value, we limited 
eligible collateral to the most high-quality, liquid assets--
Treasuries, Government agency securities, and agency mortgage-
backed securities (MBS) only--and advances are made with 
recourse beyond the pledged collateral to the borrower. Similar 
to other programs established under section 13(3) of the FRA, 
we also obtained $25 billion in credit protection from the 
Department of the Treasury, which is an important factor in 
assuring that the loans made by the Reserve Banks are secured 
to the satisfaction of the Reserve Banks.

Q.5. During your testimony before the Senate Banking Committee 
on June 22, you indicated that you had desired a solution, such 
as a merger or acquisition, to prevent First Republic Bank from 
being placed into FDIC receivership. On June 23, Treasury 
Secretary Yellen gave remarks at the Summit for a New Global 
Financing Pact indicating that there are likely to be more bank 
mergers this year. These remarks seem to be in stark contrast 
to others in this Administration, such as the assistant 
attorney general for antitrust at the Department of Justice 
(DOJ), who has spoken harshly about bank mergers and has 
indicated that future reviews will be scrutinized more and 
deterred.
    What are your views on bank mergers and acquisitions, and 
will the Federal Reserve be providing any input to the DOJ as 
it rewrites its bank M&A rules?

A.5. Mergers are a healthy feature of most sectors, including 
banking. Merger activity by institutions of all sizes is 
affected by a number of factors, including the economic 
environment, the industry outlook, statutory changes, and 
factors unique to particular institutions.
    The Federal Reserve takes seriously its responsibility to 
evaluate bank mergers under the statutory factors established 
by Congress, including specific factors that the Board must 
consider in evaluating merger proposals--competition, financial 
and managerial resources and future prospects, convenience and 
needs of communities to be served, Community Reinvestment Act 
(CRA) performance, Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering 
compliance, and financial stability.
    Board staff has been engaging in discussions with staff of 
the other banking agencies regarding our bank merger 
frameworks, and with staff of the Department of Justice 
regarding its ongoing review of the joint bank merger 
guidelines.

Q.6. In September 2022, the Congressional Budget Office found 
that the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing between the 
fourth quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2021 resulted 
in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet doubling to $8.8 
trillion, accounting for 36 percent of the United States' GDP. 
\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \3\ https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2022-09/57519-balance-
sheet.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Do you believe it is appropriate for the Federal Reserve to 
hold assets comprising such a substantial portion of our 
national GDP?

A.6. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy actions, including 
those related to the size of our balance sheet, are guided by 
our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for 
the American people.
    Beginning in March 2020, the Federal Reserve responded to 
severe disruptions to Treasury markets that threatened the U.S. 
economy and Federal Reserve's monetary policy goals by 
initiating an asset purchase program, expanding its holdings of 
Treasury and agency MBS. The Federal Reserve's purchases, which 
increased the size of its balance sheet, were crucial in 
fostering smooth market functioning and accommodative financial 
conditions, supporting the flow of credit to households and 
businesses amid the economic stresses caused by the COVID 
pandemic.
    Since 2022, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the 
stance of monetary policy, including through the reduction in 
the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and increasing 
the target range of the Federal funds rate by 5\1/4\ percentage 
points. In accordance with the Federal Open Market Committee's 
(FOMC) plans for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's 
balance sheet, we are doing so in a predictable manner over 
time to maintain the orderly functioning of Treasury and agency 
MBS markets. Since the Federal Reserve began reducing the size 
of its balance sheet in June 2022, our holdings of Treasury and 
agency securities have declined by more than $1.3 trillion. 
Over time, the FOMC intends to maintain securities holdings in 
amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and 
effectively in its ample reserves regime. To ensure a smooth 
transition, the FOMC intends to slow and then stop the decline 
in the size of the balance sheet when reserve balances are 
somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample 
reserves. Once balance sheet runoff has ceased, reserve 
balances will likely continue to decline for a time, reflecting 
growth in other Federal Reserve liabilities, until the FOMC 
judges that reserve balances are at an ample level. Thereafter, 
the FOMC will manage securities holdings as needed to maintain 
ample reserves over time.

Q.7. What role do you believe quantitative easing of this 
magnitude and the subsequent quantitative tightening played in 
the liquidity crunch the financial system is currently facing 
and the recent bank failures?

A.7. Our monetary policy decisions have been, and continue to 
be, driven by the outlook for our dual mandate goals of maximum 
employment and price stability.
    One of banks' core businesses is to manage interest rate 
risk. The overwhelming majority of banks have appropriately 
managed this risk, and the banking system as a whole is sound 
and resilient. However, we have seen that a small number of 
banks did not develop effective interest rate risk measurement 
tools, models, and metrics, and failed to manage the interest 
rate risk of their securities holdings. Some of these banks 
also failed to manage the risks of their liabilities. These 
management deficiencies, along with supervisory shortcomings, 
played a central role in last year's bank failures. We are 
committed to learning the right lessons from those events and 
taking appropriate action going forward.

Q.8. In the wake of the supervisory failings at Silicon Valley 
Bank (SVB), there is concern that a predictable outcome could 
be that the Federal Reserve System examination staff feel 
compelled to find shortcomings or issues with banks that they 
lose sight of the big picture. In the words of former FDIC 
Chairman Jelena McWilliams, ``[o]ur examination approach should 
not be such that we focus more on seeking out dirt than on 
whether the home is clean.'' \4\ While we must ensure that 
regulators and examination staff learn from past mistakes, we 
must also ensure that they do not run afoul of established 
practices and swing the supervisory pendulum too far in any 
direction.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \4\ https://www.fdic.gov/news/speeches/2019/spmar2119.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Do you believe that the supervisory pendulum could be at 
risk of swinging too far?
    How do you best ensure that supervision is balanced and 
effective?

A.8. The Federal Reserve conducts supervision in a manner that 
is appropriate to the scale of observed and emerging risks for 
various banking organizations.
    The Federal Reserve groups banking organizations of a 
similar size, fostering a peer approach to supervision that 
results in consistency in programs, resources, and analyses. At 
a high level, banking organizations are grouped into the 
following categories: the Large Institution Supervision 
Coordinating Committee program supervises firms that pose 
elevated risk to U.S. financial stability; the Large and 
Foreign Banking Organization program supervises U.S. firms with 
total assets of $100 billion or more and all foreign banking 
organizations operating in the U.S.; the Regional Banking 
Organization program supervises U.S. firms with total assets 
between $10 billion and $100 billion; and the Community Banking 
Organization program supervises U.S. firms with less than $10 
billion in total assets. Organizing the supervision function in 
this manner and utilizing the related management groups helps 
the Federal Reserve ensure that like issues are treated 
consistently within the group and is also helpful in 
contrasting practices between groups. Contrasting practices is 
important to ensure that the Federal Reserve does not apply 
tougher standards to lower systemic risk portfolios/banks than 
higher systemic risk portfolios/banks.
    Additionally, the Federal Reserve makes available to any 
financial institution subject to its supervision an appeal 
process for ``material supervisory determinations,'' including 
but not limited to, any material determination relating to 
examination or inspection composite ratings, material 
examination or inspection component ratings, the adequacy of 
loan loss reserves and/or capital, significant loan 
classification, accounting interpretation, Matters Requiring 
Attention, Matters Requiring Immediate Attention, CRA ratings 
(including component ratings), and consumer compliance ratings. 
Material supervisory determinations do not include any 
supervisory determination for which an independent right of 
appeal or a referral to another Government agency exists. The 
Federal Reserve provides a standard disclosure in its 
examination reports that alerts banks of the appeal process. 
For more information, please see the Board's Ombuds Policy 
Statement. \5\

Q.9. In an interview on June 20, Vice Chair for Supervision 
Barr stated, ``instead of thinking of a stressful scenario and 
then seeing how it would play out through on, say, the balance 
sheet of a firm, you look at a bank and you say, well, what 
would it take to really break this institution?'' \6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \6\ https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/events/regional-
outreach/2023/0620-2023
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Do you agree with Mr. Barr's suggestion that the Fed 
conduct reverse stress testing?
    Why or why not?

A.9. Reverse stress testing is not a part of the Board's 
supervisory stress testing program.

Q.10. In a speech on June 22 at the Peterson Institute for 
International Economics, FDIC Chairman Gruenberg claimed that 
``it would be a mistake to consider the pandemic a true stress 
test of the capital adequacy of the banking system''. \7\ In a 
March 2021 research paper published by the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System entitled, COVID-19 as a Stress 
Test: Assessing the Bank Regulatory Framework, the authors 
asserted that ``the widespread economic damage caused by the 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses the first major test of the 
bank regulatory reforms put in place following the global 
financial crisis.'' \8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \7\ https://www.fdic.gov/news/speeches/2023/spjun2223.html
     \8\ https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/
2021024pap.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Do you believe that the pandemic was a true stress test of 
the capital adequacy of the banking system?
    If no, why not?

A.10. The COVID pandemic and the forceful measures taken to 
control its spread put enormous stress on the global economy 
and the financial system. In the U.S., the unemployment rate 
soared by more than ten percentage points in April 2020, and 
the stock market fell by around 30 percent in a month. These 
macroeconomic and financial conditions are comparable in some 
ways to the conditions outlined in supervisory stress scenarios 
published by the Board. One notable difference, however, was 
that the crisis was met with swift and forceful policy action 
across the Government that likely mitigated the adverse effects 
on banks and other financial intermediaries.
    As I have said, the performance of U.S. banks in times of 
stress has greatly benefited from reforms to capital, 
liquidity, and risk management implemented by the banking 
agencies in the wake of the global financial crisis. As we saw 
in the pandemic, the banking system was able to serve as a 
source of strength, meeting the credit needs of households and 
businesses.
                                ------                                


        RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR ROUNDS
                     FROM JEROME H. POWELL

Q.1. Over the past year, the Fed has acted aggressively to tame 
inflation and yet we are still seeing price increases--I 
believe this further proves that we have long been feeling the 
effects of policy-induced inflation resulting from decisions by 
the Biden administration, primarily cutting off supply to 
domestic energy production. I continue to be concerned that if 
you attempt to use the tools that are available at this time to 
address what I believe to be the policy-induced side of 
inflation, you risk hurting the economy. Since your last 
appearance before this Committee we have seen three banks fail 
due in part to unmanaged interest rate risk. The FOMC decided 
to pause rates at the last meeting--but clearly, we have 
already faced the substantial untended consequences of using a 
blunt force instrument like the Federal funds rate.
    Mr. Chairman do you believe you currently have the monetary 
policy tools to reduce inflation?
    Have you identified other potential unintended consequences 
we could face as a result of fighting policy-induced inflation 
with the Federal funds rate? What are they?

A.1. We have both the tools we need to achieve our statutory 
objectives and the commitment to bring inflation back down to 
our 2 percent goal. Since March 2022, the Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC) has raised the target range for the Federal 
funds rate by 5\1/4\ percentage points and reduced our 
securities holdings by just over $1.2 trillion. Monetary policy 
is well into restrictive territory and putting downward 
pressure on demand and inflation. Aggregate demand and supply 
are continuing to come into better balance, assisted by the 
restrictive stance of monetary policy and continued 
normalization of supply conditions.
    My colleagues and I are highly attentive to the risks that 
high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are 
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent 
objective. In light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far 
we have come, the FOMC is proceeding carefully. We will 
continue to make decisions about the extent of any additional 
policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive 
based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving 
outlook, and the balance of risks.

Q.2. In a March hearing, you stated that the Federal Reserve is 
a consensus organization and said, ``I will do everything I can 
possibly do to bring people together in consensus and have a 
capital framework that could be broadly supported.'' Following 
the Hearing, other Governors have stated that a broad-based 
imposition of new capital requirements on all banks with more 
than $50 billion in assets would be a far costlier solution 
than taking the time to specifically identify and address the 
actual issues that caused the most recent failures.
    What steps have you taken to make certain there is 
consensus on a new capital framework?
    Will you make sure the entire Board has an opportunity to 
provide input and for the Board to build consensus on a 
proposal before it is released to the public?

A.2. I believe it is important to seek consensus, and as a 
general matter, I regularly discuss matters that may come 
before the Federal Reserve Board (Board) with other Board 
members. Soliciting input is a critical part of our process 
when we consider any significant matter, including changes to 
our regulatory framework. As recommendations are formulated 
related to banking supervision and regulation, I frequently 
offer my advice and counsel to the Vice Chair for Supervision, 
who has a responsibility to bring regulatory recommendations 
before the Board, consistent with statutory authority. 
Ultimately, Board members consider proposals before the Board 
using their own independent judgment.

Q.3. There are numerous economic studies that have found that 
raising capital will increase borrowing costs, which will add 
further drag to the economy anywhere between $50 billion-$200 
billion a year. That is a $50 billion-$200 billion cost to the 
economy year after year after year as long as heightened 
capital requirements are put into place. Are you working with 
Vice Chair Barr to make sure he is taking those tradeoffs into 
account as he is finalizing his holistic capital review?

A.3. The Board, together with the Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(collectively, the agencies), recently proposed amendments to 
the capital rule for large banking organizations for public 
comment, which included a detailed analysis of the expected 
impacts of the proposal.
    As I noted in my statement on the proposal, while there 
could be benefits of still higher capital, as always, we must 
also consider the potential costs. High levels of capital are 
essential to enable banks to continue to lend to households and 
businesses and conduct financial intermediation, even in times 
of severe stress. But raising capital requirements also 
increases the cost of, and reduces access to, credit. Noting 
the importance as well as the difficulty of striking the right 
balance, I emphasized the need for public input and thoughtful 
deliberation.
    To that end, the agencies launched a data collection to 
gather more information from the banks affected by the proposal 
in order to further clarify the estimated effects of the 
proposal and inform any final rule. We also extended the 
comment period from November 30, 2023, to January 16, 2024, to 
allow interested parties more time to analyze the issues and 
prepare their comments. I look forward to reviewing and 
assessing the data and the comments we receive.

Q.4. As the U.S. implements Basel III Finalization, I'm worried 
about global competitiveness. In order to mitigate the capital 
impact on EU banks, and in line with the G20 commitment not to 
significantly increase bank capital due to the Basel reforms, 
Europe has proposed several material deviations from the Basel 
accord and has decided to delay the full capital impact on 
European banks until at least 2030. Given those developments, 
are you concerned that the proposal could put our banks at a 
competitive disadvantage with their foreign counterparts and 
will you commit to making sure U.S. banks are not put at a 
competitive disadvantage before voting on the proposal?

A.4. The Board actively monitors how other jurisdictions are 
implementing the Basel III reforms. U.S. implementation of the 
final set of Basel III reforms would take into account, among 
other factors, practices of U.S. firms, U.S. legal 
requirements, and other domestic policy objectives. In general, 
international comparisons suggest strong capital requirements 
support banks and the U.S. economy, as they allow the banking 
sector to serve as a source of strength for the U.S. economy 
and to lend to creditworthy households and businesses during 
times of economic stress. Robust capital standards at U.S. 
banks are critical in ensuring our banks remain strong and able 
to compete for international business.
    However, as I noted in my statement during the July 27 Open 
Board Meeting, the proposal exceeds what is required by the 
Basel agreement and exceeds, as well, what we know of plans for 
implementation by other large jurisdictions. For example, the 
proposal would require U.S. banks to cease using their own 
internal models for credit risk and operational risk and 
instead use only a standardized approach. This proposed change 
is intended to achieve the sensible goals of avoiding uneven 
implementation across similar risks at different banks, as well 
as gaming of the requirements. We will need to ensure that the 
consistency and anti-arbitrage benefits of the new standardized 
approaches outweigh the costs of treating the risks of some 
quite different business activities as identical, which could 
reduce risk capture and discourage less risky activities. I 
look forward to reviewing and assessing the comments we receive 
from the public on the Board's proposed rule, including how 
best to strike the balance between the potential benefits and 
costs of higher capital.

        RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR BRITT
                     FROM JEROME H. POWELL

Q.1. I know the Federal Reserve remains in an exploratory stage 
on assessing the impacts of issuing a U.S. digital dollar, 
although I believe significant ambiguity remains around what 
problem a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency would really 
solve. Furthermore, I believe we need to think deeply about any 
potential consequences that may come to the banking sector and 
broader financial system with the potential issuance of a U.S. 
CBDC. For example, a Government-issued digital dollar would 
directly compete with community bank deposits, it would have 
far-reaching effects on the U.S. payments system, and we would 
need to consider the privacy implications of the U.S. 
Government having direct access to financial transaction data.
    Do you believe at this stage that it is unlikely the 
benefits of a central bank digital currently would be greater 
than these potential risks, and will you commit to engaging 
with banks of all sizes to ensure their voice is heard before 
taking any further action as it relates to a U.S. CBDC?
    Additionally, you have previously testified before the 
Senate Banking Committee that the Federal Reserve will not 
proceed with issuing a Central Bank Digital Currency without 
clear direction from Congress. Do you still stick by this 
commitment?

A.1. The Federal Reserve is focused on the future of money and 
payments as shaped by technological innovation. This work 
involves research and experimentation to fully understand 
technological innovations and their associated policy benefits, 
risks, and tradeoffs, as well as implications for Federal 
Reserve payment infrastructures. As a part of this work, the 
Federal Reserve is examining whether a U.S. central bank 
digital currency (CBDC) would improve on an already safe and 
efficient domestic payments system. As I have stated 
previously, the Federal Reserve would not proceed with issuance 
of a CBDC that is widely available to the public without clear 
support from the Executive branch and Congress in the form of a 
specific authorizing law.
    The Federal Reserve's 2022 discussion paper, Money and 
Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation, 
highlighted potential risks and benefits of a U.S. CBDC; noted 
that any potential U.S. CBDC would need to be privacy-
protected, intermediated, transferable, and identity-verified; 
and asked for public input. We received feedback from a wide 
range of stakeholders, including banks of all sizes. A summary 
of this feedback can be found on our public website. \1\ In 
addition to the 2022 discussion paper, the Federal Reserve has 
continued to engage with a wide range of stakeholders, 
including financial institutions, academics, industry groups, 
technology and service providers, and Members of Congress, 
about key issues related to financial technologies.
