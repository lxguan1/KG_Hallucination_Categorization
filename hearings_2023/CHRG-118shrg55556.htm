                 Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:02 a.m. in 
Room SD-366, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Joe Manchin 
III, Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

    The Chairman. Today we are going to continue this 
Committee's ongoing oversight of the reliability challenges 
facing our electric grid. Reliable energy is foundational for 
any advanced economy and critical for families and businesses 
to thrive. And when electricity is unreliable, the potential 
consequences are nothing short of catastrophic, including the 
loss of human life. We know that our grid is most strained 
during the hottest and coldest periods of the year. That is 
why, before each summer and winter, the North American Electric 
Reliability Corporation (NERC) issues a reliability assessment, 
and the latest assessments have been frightening. The chart 
behind me shows NERC's short-term assessment for this summer 
and the long-term assessment for the next five years. The 
orange shows that we have a challenge and that the reliability 
is not certain. The red is serious, and for the next five 
years, just about the whole country is in a situation where we 
are not as reliable as we could and should be. Both assessments 
show two-thirds of the country facing reliability challenges as 
soon as this summer and lasting well into the future. I think 
all of us will agree that this is unacceptable, but it is not 
surprising.
    [The chart referred to follows:]
    
    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    
    The Chairman. I have expressed strong concerns for years 
that this is what an unmanaged energy transition would look 
like. FERC and NERC have made recent efforts to develop new 
cold weather reliability standards to put us on firmer footing. 
These were much-needed steps, but more action is needed. And 
while increasingly extreme weather events are a part of the 
reliability challenge, we are also hearing growing concerns 
from grid operators across the country about losing our 
dispatchable generation resources before we are able to replace 
them. I want to take a moment now to remind everyone that all 
four FERC commissioners sat right where you are sitting and 
testified just last month that the grid will not be ready to 
operate without coal power in the near future, and if we want 
to maintain a reliable system, it must be there.
    Yet through regulation after regulation, the Administration 
seems hell-bent on accelerating the premature retirements of 
our fossil plants. That is coupled with gaps in our power 
market designs that fail to require the right reliability 
attributes for renewables being added to the grid, and 
excessively long permitting processes are keeping us from 
bringing any new generation resources online in a timely 
fashion, whether it's fossil, renewables, nuclear--all of the 
above. We have a challenge. It seems the question is not if we 
will face another electric reliability crisis, but when. And 
the American people need us to do better than what we have.
    Let me address federal regulations first. There is no doubt 
that our electric grid is undergoing a transition, both in 
generation sources and in the types of demand the grid is 
called on to serve. But the speed of this transition must be 
balanced against reliability and affordability of electricity. 
We know much larger portions of our grid would have experienced 
blackouts during Winter Storms Elliot and Uri if our coal fleet 
was retired prematurely. During these storms, coal power was 
one of the most reliable energy sources. But the EPA won't let 
electric reliability inconvenience their anti-fossil agenda.
    Within six months of Winter Storm Elliot, EPA's response 
was to roll out four new regulations poised to shut down 50,000 
megawatts or more of coal power over the next decade--whether 
the grid is ready for it or not. The only thing I would say to 
all of you, if you are concerned about that and what direction 
we are going and you don't want to make the mistake, talk to 
the Germans. Talk to Germany, and find out what they did, how 
it worked for them. EPA is not hiding their strategy. It is 
death by a thousand unreasonable cuts for fossil. For example, 
if you want to operate a fossil plant, the new proposed rules 
say that you are going to need CCUS, but the fact is, the 
Administration has not approved a single Class VI well permit 
that would allow captured CO<INF>2</INF> to be securely stored. 
Let me be clear--a requirement to use CCUS with a refusal to 
issue CCUS permits is a shutdown requirement. Congress has 
charged NERC with protecting the reliability of the electric 
system, but I am not sure the people are aware that agencies 
like EPA are not required to, and usually do not consult NERC 
about the reliability impacts of proposed new regulations on 
power plants. This makes absolutely no sense at all.
    I know my colleague Senator Barrasso has legislation to 
change that, and I am also working on legislation to address 
this glaring omission. Having our environmental regulator work 
with our reliability regulator on power plant rules is just 
common sense if we don't want a catastrophe. This is something 
I would think every member of our Committee could support. We 
also know that the pressures on dispatchable power plants are 
not just a product of federal regulations, it is also driven by 
state policies and gaps in the way our electricity markets 
value reliability. At its core, this is a simple math problem. 
We are seeing more dispatchable resources shut down faster than 
new dispatchable resources are being added. We have seen over 
90 gigawatts of coal power retire in the last decade, and we 
could see twice as much dispatchable capacity retire over the 
next decade on the path we are heading down. And by 
dispatchable, I mean controllable and flexible to meet supply 
and demand. Right now, that includes coal, gas, nuclear, and 
hydropower. And in the future, it will include renewables 
paired with storage, too. But the markets are not valuing 
dispatchable resources of any type properly to reflect the 
problem that we have. And the buck stops at our grid operators, 
like PJM, MISO, and certain utilities who are required by law 
to ensure NERC reliability standards are met.
    Our markets have allowed renewables to receive the same 
payments as dispatchable resources without providing the same 
benefits to the grid. I want to acknowledge that PJM and other 
markets have recently taken initial steps to begin 
appropriately compensating the reliability benefits of 
different types of power plants, but much more is needed. This 
can't be more clearly demonstrated than in PJM's recent 
assessment that 40 gigawatts of existing generation are at risk 
of retirement by 2030, yet only about 30 gigawatts of 
equivalent capacity are projected to be added. And at the same 
time, demand on PJM is expected to grow by 15 gigawatts, 
resulting in declining reserve margins for the first time in 
recent history.
    So I am interested to hear our witnesses' perspectives on 
market changes that would ensure these critical dispatchable 
resources are not retiring prematurely without adequate, 
reliable replacements. I also believe FERC needs clear 
authority to keep these reliability-critical generators from 
prematurely retiring and to issue regulatory exemptions as 
necessary so that ratepayers are not being penalized just to 
keep the lights on, because the impact of these collective EPA 
regulations is also a fairness issue. Take a coal plant as an 
example, which has already invested tens if not hundreds of 
millions of dollars on environmental upgrades, like scrubbers, 
bag houses, and low-NO<INF>X</INF> boilers--and now could be 
required to spend tens or hundreds of millions more or else 
shut down. The investments already made have useful lives of 
decades, and ratepayers are going to be on the hook paying for 
them for decades whether the plant is shut down or not. It is 
ridiculous.
    Is this Administration, which claims to be focused on 
equity, blind to the fact that the policies that they are 
pushing are going to harm low-income ratepayers in states like 
West Virginia, Wyoming, and all the other rural states by 
saddling them with unaffordable power while stripping them of 
reliable energy? For generators that must remain online for 
reliability, we must not penalize their ratepayers by requiring 
hundreds of millions of dollars in additional environmental 
controls that will not ever be recouped in the remaining life 
of the plant.
    I also want to speak briefly about electric transmission. 
The fact of the matter is that large, multi-state transmission 
lines are needed for reliability, but they are rarely getting 
built. And the wait to connect new generation to the 
transmission grid is growing at the same time that we need 
these resources more than ever. Wait times went from two years 
in the 2000s, to an average of five years by 2022. We have over 
two terawatts--that's two million megawatts--waiting in the 
queue. These delays are having real impacts on getting 
dispatchable generation onto the grid. In Doddridge County, 
West Virginia, a little county in my state, a new 1,800-
megawatt natural gas plant with carbon capture is stuck waiting 
68 months to get connected to the PJM transmission system. I am 
very glad to see important NEPA reforms included in the debt 
ceiling deal that myself and many of our members in this 
Committee have advocated for, which will help projects like 
this complete federal NEPA reviews in one to two years. But it 
takes five years to hook into the grid. That could become the 
bottleneck instead of NEPA.
    So I think more needs to be done to improve federal 
permitting of all types of energy infrastructure, including 
transmission. I welcome our witnesses' perspectives on how 
permitting reform for all types of energy can benefit electric 
reliability, whether it is transmission lines to move electrons 
between states and regions, pipelines to better supply our gas 
generators, or anything else it takes to get reliable energy in 
our country. Your input will help inform our Committee's future 
work on permitting. Our Committee has responsibility for 
ensuring that our federal power laws and energy agencies are 
promoting reliable electricity for the nation. I am confident 
we can develop bipartisan proposals to better equip NERC and 
FERC and the electric industry with tools to address the 
reliability threats the grid is facing. All four of our 
witnesses have provided suggestions for Congress to act in 
their written testimony, including increasing the involvement 
of our reliability experts in developing environmental 
regulations, better management of the pace of retirements, 
permitting reforms, and several other ideas worth considering.
    So I look forward to hearing recommendations from each of 
you about the most impactful steps that we could take as a 
Committee.
    With that, I turn to Senator Barrasso for his opening 
remarks.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING

    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks so much, Mr. Chairman.
    And first, I do look forward to continuing to work with you 
on permitting reform. As you said, there is more we can do. 
There is more we should do. There is more we need to do. And 
that is why I have joined with every Republican on this 
Committee in introducing the SPUR Act. It stands for Spur 
Permitting of Underdeveloped Resources Act. And America needs 
to generate more--not less--energy. We need more home-grown 
energy--natural gas, coal, uranium. You name it, we need it 
all. We need to have a reliable electric grid. That means 
generating more, not less, reliable and available and 
affordable power. A transmission line without reliable and 
available electricity is like a stream bed without water 
flowing through it. So as we continue to work on permitting 
reform, Mr. Chairman, we need to focus on producing more 
reliable American energy and not just on how to transport it.
    So with that, Mr. Chairman, I am so grateful that you 
called today's hearing. Reliable, resilient, affordable 
electric service is indispensable to our nation. When the 
electric grid fails, it puts our other essential services at 
risk or makes them unavailable. The consequences are 
catastrophic. There is no disputing the fact that electricity 
needs to be produced at the instant people call for it. Men and 
women who enable our electric grids to work must hold 
production and demand in balance all the time. They must do 
this year in, year out, no matter what time of day, no matter 
what the weather happens to be. No excuse. No finger pointing 
is acceptable when an electric system fails.
    We know the sad reality. Electric service in this country 
is at an increasing risk--an unacceptable risk of failure. One 
can't predict blackouts, yet given current trends, one can 
reasonably project that we will have more of what regulators 
are calling unplanned outages. The writing is on the wall. 
Summer 2020--California's energy policies left the state's 
electric grid operators with no other choice but to impose 
rolling blackouts on its residents. February 2021--cold weather 
and insufficient baseload power resulted in a major blackout in 
Texas. December 2022--cold weather and a failure to secure 
sufficient natural gas nearly led to a blackout in the entire 
mid-Atlantic. After the 2021 blackout, two of the four 
witnesses before us today sat here at the same witness table 
and warned us of similar risks to the grid. They will warn us 
of that again today.
    Just last month, members of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission warned us of the same threats. Commissioner Danly 
said there is ``an impending, but avoidable reliability 
crisis.'' Commissioner Christie said, ``there is a looming 
reliability crisis.'' Neither Commissioner issued these 
warnings lightly. Commissioner Danly said, ``I fervently hope 
to be proven wrong.'' Commissioner Christie said, ``I do not 
use the term crisis for melodrama, but because it is an 
accurate description of what we are facing.'' Commissioner 
Christie put it succinctly when he said, ``the problem 
generally is not the addition of intermittent resources--
primarily wind and solar--but the far-too-rapid subtraction of 
dispatchable resources, especially coal and gas.'' I think we 
are going to hear similar testimony from our witnesses today.
    Electric grid operators must have access to a diverse set 
of resources. That includes coal, natural gas, nuclear, and 
hydropower, along with wind and solar. Electric transmission 
can help with a big challenge, weather related or otherwise, 
whatever comes along. Transmission helps one region lean on 
another. Still, we must have electrons to put on the 
transmission lines. We must address the problem of premature 
retirements of plants that generate power at all times. Wind 
and solar energy now supply about 15 percent of the nation's 
power. They do not replace always-on power. When the wind 
doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine, we get no power. We 
must acknowledge the indispensable value of power plants that 
generate electricity whenever they are called upon.
    Last fall, President Biden said, ``we are going to be 
shutting coal plants down all across America.'' Just last 
month, the EPA proposed new regulations to shut down both coal 
and natural gas plants. President Biden is doubling down on 
reckless policies. They are a danger to our electric grid. We 
need to restore balance. President Biden's Administration 
rarely lets a day go by without talking about what they 
mistakenly and inaccurately call the ``Climate Crisis.'' It is 
time they acknowledge their policies are creating a reliability 
crisis.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Barrasso.
    Before we go to the witnesses, I am going to turn to 
Senator Wyden because he has another pressing committee he has 
to go to.
    Senator Wyden.
    Senator Wyden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    And Mr. Chairman, I want to commend you for holding a very 
important hearing and make just a couple of points real 
quickly, and then I have a question that I am going to pose for 
the record to Mr. Tudor, who has been doing great work for the 
rural electrics.
    In early summer of 2021, after designing it and writing it, 
particularly with the input of the Chairman, the Senate Finance 
Committee moved close to $300 billion worth of clean energy tax 
credits, the biggest investment in energy security and climate 
in our country's history. At the time--and we have a number of 
colleagues from the Committee, the Senator from Nevada, Senator 
Cortez Masto--we said we had two additional priorities, Mr. 
Chairman. And we started working on that. One of them you just 
mentioned in your testimony, and that is expanding 
transmission. We know that that is vitally important. And 
second, we have to harden the power grid. And Mr. Tudor, your 
folks were very helpful to us in the Disaster Safe Power Grid 
Act, which we got into the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill.
    And my question, just so you will have it for the record 
is, I would like you, in the course of the morning, to outline 
the additional steps that your members in rural communities 
need to further harden the power grid. We know we are going to 
have another tough fire season. I am looking down the row here 
and my colleagues are going to be asking you about that too. 
This is not something that is an abstract kind of question. 
This is existential for western communities.
    So thank you for your cooperation.
    Mr. Chairman, you have been helping us from the get-go, and 
I remember those first days when you invited me to West 
Virginia and we will continue that cooperation.
    I yield back.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Wyden.
    And again, I want to say thank you to all of our witnesses 
today for being here. We appreciate it very much.
    I want to introduce all of you.
    We have Mr. Jim Robb, President and CEO of the North 
American Electric Reliability Corporation.
    Mr. Manu Asthana--is that close?
    Mr. Asthana. You got it.
    The Chairman. Hot dog.
    President and CEO of PJM.
    We have Dr. Melissa Lott, Senior Research Scholar and 
Director of Research at the Columbia Center on Global Energy 
Policy.
    And we have Mr. David Tudor, CEO and General Manager of 
Associated Electric Cooperative.
    Mr. Robb, we are going to start with you.

      STATEMENT OF JAMES B. ROBB, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EX-
       ECUTIVE  OFFICER,  NORTH  AMERICAN  ELECTRIC RELI-
       ABILITY CORPORATION

    Mr. Robb. Great. Well, good morning, Chairman Manchin and 
members of the Committee. It is a pleasure to be here. I 
appreciate the opportunity to discuss our views on the 
reliability and resilience of the electric grid, Ranking Member 
Barrasso, as well.
    First of all, we believe that the electric power system is 
absolutely at an inflection point right now. The electric 
transmission grid is highly reliable and resilient, yet the 
risk profile to customers is steadily increasing. Our 
assessments demonstrate that the electric grid is operating 
ever closer to the edge, where more frequent and more serious 
disruptions are increasingly likely. We also believe that the 
energy transformation can be navigated in a reliable way. That 
is, of course, with the proviso that the pace of grid 
transformation is recalibrated with the reliability needs of 
the system.
    Let me begin by reviewing four major factors contributing 
to this deteriorating risk profile. First, the foundation upon 
which the grid operates is out of balance. The system must 
constantly balance affordability, reliability, and 
environmental sustainability, and we are not making the 
required investments for reliability as the system transforms. 
NERC reliability assessments demonstrate this lack of balance. 
Our summer and long-term assessments, as you showed earlier 
today, show that the risk of energy shortfalls is increasing 
and spreading to more areas of the country. This is 
particularly true during periods of extreme weather, as we have 
experienced over the past five years, with broad area heat 
events impacting the West and widespread severe cold events 
impacting the eastern and southeastern portion of the U.S. This 
trend is being driven by disorderly retirements of conventional 
generating capacity--often coal, nuclear, and older natural 
gas; performance issues with replacement resources; energy 
uncertainty during increasingly frequent, wide-area, long-
duration extreme weather events; and increased demand due to 
electrification policies coupled with the slow development of 
energy infrastructure.
    The second, while the risk is increasing, the underlying 
performance of the electric grid that NERC oversees continues 
to improve, suggesting the success of the ERO model. In the 
bulk electric system that is under our direct jurisdiction, we 
see sustained improvements in human and equipment performance, 
leading to substantially reduced unplanned transmission 
outages. We have not had a major cascading failure of the 
system in over 13 years.
    Third, a number of interrelated factors behind high-profile 
outages such as Winter Storms Uri and Elliot, the Summer 2020 
outage in California, and a series of near-misses are driving 
risk. These factors include the performance of inverter-based 
resources, performance issues with generation under extreme 
weather conditions, fuel supply disruption, especially natural 
gas during winter conditions, and a general decline in the 
reliable generating capacity, which is removing the highly 
valuable slack in the system.
    And fourth, I have to acknowledge that new technologies do 
offset some of these risks. Some of these emerging technologies 
that are being deployed have the potential, in the long run, to 
make a substantial difference, especially batteries.
    So let me turn to solution space, beginning with NERC's 
actions. We are highly focused on the performance of inverter-
based technologies to ensure that they can contribute to 
reliability and not compromise it during periods of stress, as 
we have experienced in multiple events. We are working to 
establish planning requirements that focus on energy 
sufficiency to meet 24/7 customer demands. Our efforts are 
focused both on near-term operations as well as long-term 
planning horizons. We are working to incorporate more extreme 
weather conditions and scenarios into our planning and 
operating requirements. To that end, we have also established 
FERC-approved weatherization requirements for generating 
plants. We are also focused on understanding and establishing 
performance requirements for the increasing number of 
generating facilities, often inverter-based, that are 
connecting at voltages below the level of the bulk electric 
system. It is important to note here that our goal is not to 
expand our jurisdiction, but simply to ensure that these 
resources support reliability.
    And I will conclude here with a call for action in five 
areas outside of our direct jurisdiction. First, we absolutely 
need to rethink the policy and oversight of the intersection of 
the natural gas industry with the electric sector. Natural gas 
is the largest power generation fuel in the United States, and 
power generation is now the largest end-use consumer of natural 
gas. It is time that we acknowledge that and address the 
reliability and resilience of this key interface. Second, we 
need to ensure that the appropriate investments in reliability 
and fuel security are rewarded, particularly in the areas of 
the country that rely on power markets and market signals to 
drive investments in operating decisions. Next, reliability 
needs to be prioritized and policy decisions made by other 
executive branch departments that affect the pace of 
retirements. And because the low-carbon future requires 
significant investment in electric transmission and other 
energy infrastructure, we must break the back of the 
infrastructure siting challenge. And then, finally, we need to 
keep our foot on the gas, accelerating the deployment and 
development of new technologies, such as grid-forming 
inverters, energy storage, new nuclear technologies, and 
hydrogen.
    As we continue to electrify the economy, reliability is 
going to only become increasingly important. And as I like to 
tell my team, nearly 400 million citizens across North America 
depend on a reliable supply of electricity to support their way 
of life. Thank you.

          STATEMENT OF MANU ASTHANA, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF
          EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PJM INTERCONNECTION, L.L.C.

    Mr. Asthana. Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member Barrasso, and 
members of the Committee, good morning and thank you for the 
opportunity to participate in this hearing.
    I am the CEO of PJM Interconnection. PJM was formed in 1927 
and has grown to become the largest grid operator in the U.S. 
We direct the operation of the grid in all or parts of 13 
states and DC, serving 65 million customers. PJM does not have 
a profit motive. We are revenue-neutral and independent of our 
members. Our primary purpose is maintaining the reliability of 
the bulk power system, and this is a responsibility we take 
very seriously. Like most of the country, our grid is in 
transition. And to give you a sense of scale, our peak load is 
about 150 gigawatts. Our interconnection queue has over 250 
gigawatts of generation waiting to be processed to see if they 
can interconnect reliably. Ninety-seven percent of this 
generation is solar, wind, batteries, or some hybrid of these 
resources.
    And so, looking at our queue, it is very clear that 
transition is happening, and PJM is committed to facilitating 
it as reliably and cost-effectively as possible, using the 
power of competitive power markets. And we have taken 
significant steps already toward this goal, including major 
interconnection reform, which is expected to result in the 
processing of over 200 gigawatts of new generation over the 
next few years. We have also launched an initiative called 
Ensuring a Reliable Energy Transition, to bring all of our work 
under a single umbrella. PJM is currently in a sound position. 
If you look at the chart that you showed, Senator Manchin, we, 
today, have sufficient generation to meet the anticipated needs 
of our system, and our markets and our planning and our 
operations add between $3 and $4 billion of value of savings a 
year to the customers in our footprint.
    However, as we look further out, we are concerned by four 
trends. And they are very similar to the trends that Jim laid 
out, but the four trends are: number one, the dispatchable 
generation we rely upon today to balance the grid is retiring 
and it is retiring at a rapid rate and it is retiring mostly 
driven by policy considerations. Second, electrification and 
large-scale data center construction is poised to create 
significant load growth in our footprint. Third, our new 
generation queue is largely intermittent, and so we need 
multiple megawatts of the new generation to replace one 
megawatt of the retiring generation. And finally, the new 
generation is coming online slower than anticipated, and there 
are a lot of reasons for this, and we can talk about it. But if 
these trends continue, we see increasing resource adequacy risk 
in the future.
    And these issues are not just a concern for us. We have 
seen the NERC chart that shows two-thirds of the country is 
already at risk of elevated resource adequacy risk as soon as 
this summer. So we believe it is critical to take steps now to 
de-risk the transition. The math of it is straightforward, even 
if the execution is not. We need to accelerate the pace of new 
entry through actions such as permitting reform, further 
interconnection reform, and policies that reduce backlog in the 
supply chain. And while most new entry is likely to be 
renewable plus batteries, given the composition of our queue, 
we will also need new natural gas resources. And so, whatever 
we do, we need to be able to enable those and the 
infrastructure that supports them.
    Additionally, we will need to slow down the retirement or 
restriction of existing generation until replacement capacity 
is deployed and operational at scale and demonstrated to be 
doing so. And frankly, we see this as the single largest risk 
in the energy transition. It is not about the entry of the new 
intermittent resources, it is about the premature exit of the 
resources that we need to balance the grid. Finally, we 
strongly encourage an approach to policymaking that expressly 
evaluates reliability impacts in the development phase of 
policy, not after the fact. And we stand ready to help with 
this evaluation and to play our part to ensure a reliable 
transition. And like Jim, we are optimistic that it is 
possible, but also, we feel it will take a different approach 
to policymaking that prioritizes reliability in it.
    Thank you very much for the opportunity to present my 
testimony today and for your attention to these important 
issues. I look forward to your questions.

      STATEMENT OF DR. MELISSA C. LOTT, SENIOR RESEARCH
       SCHOLAR AND DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH,  COLUMBIA CEN-
       TER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY
       SCHOOL OF INTERNATIONAL AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS

    Dr. Lott. Good morning, Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member 
Barrasso, and members of the Committee. Thank you for the 
invitation to speak with you today.
    My name is Melissa Lott, and I am the Director of Research 
and a Senior Research Scholar at Columbia University's Center 
on Global Energy Policy, which is a part of the School of 
International and Public Affairs. I am also an adjunct 
professor at Columbia University's Climate School, and I have 
worked as an energy systems engineer for nearly 20 years across 
the United States, as well as in Europe and Asia. Today, in the 
different positions that I hold, I also serve in roles at the 
United Nations Council of Engineers for the Energy Transition, 
which is an independent advisory council to the U.N. Secretary 
General, and I serve as a member of the World Economic Forum's 
Global Future Council on the Future of Economics of Equitable 
Transition.
    My testimony today will cover three broad things. One, the 
impacts of reliability issues on health and the economy in the 
United States. The second is the broad determinants of grid 
reliability, including the effects from different fuel sources 
and technologies in the context of the evolving supply mix. I 
will also discuss actions the Federal Government could take to 
support a reliable and affordable electricity system in the 
face of a changing climate, evolving demand for electricity, 
and also the integration of these new supply technologies.
    Electricity is a vital input to the U.S. economy. It 
supplies around 22 percent of total final energy consumption in 
the numbers we look at from 2020. And while net generation has 
remained essentially flat since 2005, the mix of technologies 
providing that electricity in the U.S. has changed 
significantly over that period. And there are expectations that 
competitive pricing, existing incentives, and commitments from 
many states and territories will lead to reductions in the use 
of existing unabated coal and gas power plants while promoting 
even more growth from renewables and potentially nuclear power 
and fossil fuel plants that are fitted with carbon capture 
technologies. And while the mix of supply technologies is 
changing significantly, so is the demand for electricity, 
particularly from personal vehicles, from heating and cooling, 
and from cooking. While the exact pathway that we are going to 
take over the coming decades is difficult to predict, a 
substantial increase in electricity demand is all but certain 
when we look at the numbers.
    This increased demand on the electricity sector will make 
reliability and affordability even more vital. In 2021, U.S. 
customers experienced an average of seven hours without power, 
and this figure is significantly higher than some other 
comparable economies. And it looks even more dramatic when we 
dive in and look at the variation between states. So customers 
in Louisiana, for example, experienced over 80 hours without 
power. Customers in Oregon experienced losses of over 25 hours. 
And those in Texas, my home state, were without power for 20 
hours. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the U.S. 
energy system a C-minus grade in their latest assessment, and 
they identify severe weather as the predominant cause of 
outages.
    When we look at access to reliable, affordable, and clean 
energy, we see it as a major determinant of health, well-being, 
and economic prosperity. Extreme weather events, which are 
increasingly likely to come in the coming decades, strain 
underprepared power systems when people need them the most. 
Extreme heat increases the need for air conditioning, and home 
heating is even more vital in the middle of extreme winter 
storms. During winter blackouts, people seek alternative fuel 
sources such as charcoal, which has led to accidental deaths 
due to carbon monoxide poisoning. And when we look at access to 
health care, it is also hampered during power outages in 
extreme weather, leaving people with elevated health needs 
particularly vulnerable. And the economic effects of 
electricity outages are also severe. Estimates put the wider 
economic impact of Winter Storm Uri at upwards of $300 
billion--just one example. More recently, Congress has provided 
leadership in supporting critical investment in clean energy 
innovation and infrastructure deployment in the Energy Act of 
2020, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and 
Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. And today, 
Congress has the opportunity to provide transformative 
leadership to ensure that the future electricity grid can 
support the delivery of reliable, affordable, and clean 
electricity to households and businesses around the country.
    In my written testimony, I outlined a number of 
recommendations for Congress to consider, and I will highlight 
three here. One is strengthening the requirements for risk 
assessments and mitigation planning in power and sector 
planning processes. So coupling up something I talk about, 
which is energy systems models and climate models, so we are 
planning for the future and not for the past. The second is 
reforming environmental review and permitting processes for 
projects across the entire electricity sector, and I say that 
intentionally--the entire sector--so supply, the grid, the 
whole thing. And the third one that I will highlight is finding 
ways to better utilize existing infrastructure and rights-of-
way to accelerate projects that can provide near-term benefits. 
I provide more details on these topics and all recommendations 
in my written testimony.
    Again, I would like to thank the Committee for holding this 
hearing on the reliability and resiliency of electricity in the 
United States in light of these recent reliability assessments 
and alerts. The investments that we have made over the past 50 
years have created an energy system that supports our health 
and well-being and our economy, and the investments that we 
make moving forward are vital. Thank you again for inviting me 
to be a part of this important discussion.

     STATEMENT OF DAVID J. TUDOR, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
      AND GENERAL MANAGER,  ASSOCIATED  ELECTRIC  COOPER-
      ATIVE INC.

    Mr. Tudor. Good morning, Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member 
Barrasso, and members of the Committee. Thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today on the threats to electric 
reliability and affordability. This is a growing threat that I 
believe will have dire consequences for the American people and 
also creates a national security risk. My name is David Tudor. 
I am the CEO of Associated Electric Cooperative, based in 
Springfield, Missouri. We are a member-owned, member-led, not-
for-profit, wholesale electric utility that delivers power to 
2.1 million mostly rural people in Missouri, Oklahoma, and 
Iowa. Associated Electric and its six transmission cooperative 
owners operate 5,700 megawatts of generation capacity and over 
10,000 miles of transmission to serve 51 distribution 
cooperatives that are owned by the 2.1. We are not a regional 
transmission organization, an RTO. In the RTO, the utilities 
pool their resources to serve their shared load. We have chosen 
to remain independent, which makes us fully responsible for 
serving our member-owners. However, we have over 200 
interconnects with SPP, MISO, and TVA. Associated Electric kept 
the lights on during Winter Storms Uri and Elliot when our 
neighboring utilities were forced into rolling blackouts.
    I am honored to be given this opportunity to testify today, 
and I have submitted extensive written testimony with actual 
data from our experience. I believe I was invited today to 
share with you how we kept the lights on when others couldn't, 
and the challenges we are now facing in continuing to do so. 
Let me start with my seven primary concerns. First, coal plants 
are being prematurely retired. According to EIA data across the 
country, 86,000 megawatts have been retired since 2011. An 
additional 73,000 megawatts have been announced to be retired 
by 2028. The new EPA rules, announced two weeks ago, will 
likely lead to more retirements despite the legal challenges 
that will be filed. Second, there is no technology to deliver 
around-the-clock, baseload electricity to replace this retired 
generation. It has to be tested, proven, financeable, and also 
connected to the transmission grid by 2028, when all these coal 
plants are retired. In fact, it is doubtful anything will be 
ready by 2035.
    Third, the queue, which has been spoken about this morning 
for new replacement generation in MISO, SPP, and PJM, is 
largely made up of intermittent resources--wind, solar, and 
battery storage. Only three to four percent is natural gas, a 
dependable resource. Fourth, these queues have major problems, 
in that each generator site must be studied for system impact 
effects and the cost to upgrade the transmission system to 
accept them into the grid, all before work could even be 
started. Fifth, new transmission takes four to six years to 
build, if the materials can be procured timely. The materials 
cannot, today, be procured timely. Transformers, conduits, and 
poles have their own queues. Sixth, the cost for new 
transmission continues to climb due to inflation and supply 
chain challenges. Seventh, maybe most important, China and 
other countries continue to build coal plants while we are 
forcing ours to retire. It's the same air.
    Associated has chosen a path less traveled because we use 
data and experience to make business decisions. I want to be 
clear--we are not against renewables. I want to be clear also 
that we need all generation resources to keep the lights on. We 
do not pick arbitrary success dates on projects or make soft 
promises to retire a plant at a future date. We do not retire 
plants that are environmentally compliant without a real 
alternative that is reliable and affordable. Our members expect 
us to keep the lights on. We survived storms Uri and Elliot 
because we have a balanced portfolio of coal, natural gas, 
hydro, and wind. Our data proves that without our coal, natural 
gas, and hydro plants we would have incurred blackouts during 
both storms. Out of the 1,240 megawatts of wind that we have, 
we had only 179 megawatts at our peak of Uri and only 552 
megawatts during Elliot. That is less than 45 percent. We set 
13 new all-time peaks during Elliot. Our fossil fuel plants and 
our independent transmission system saved the day.
    So what is the solution? The three T's--technology, 
transmission, and time. The technology will develop. The 
transmission can be built. We just need more time. We need to 
get control of the EPA, who doesn't seem to care about 
reliability or cost. We need to cut the red tape on permitting 
on all generation, transmission, and pipeline projects. And we 
need to use these IRA funds to find that technology we need so 
badly.
    In closing, this desire to put climate change objectives 
ahead of reliability in the United States is a risk not worth 
taking. It's not too late for you to take action. Thank you for 
having me today.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Tudor follows:]
    
    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    
    The Chairman. Let me thank all of you for your testimonies. 
We appreciate very much the input and your expertise.
    We will start with the questions now, and I am going to ask 
one for all the witnesses.
    From what we just heard, reliability should be the driving 
force, and the only way you know that is when you lose power 
and why it wasn't prevented. So with that being said, we have 
NERC, we have FERC, we have EPA. EPA seems to trump everything 
with policy if they are going a different direction, and it 
looks like there is not much input. Do you all believe or not 
believe it's necessary that NERC and FERC should have input as 
far as reliability when EPA is making these policy changes?
    Mr. Tudor.
    Mr. Tudor. Absolutely.
    The Chairman. Dr. Lott.
    Dr. Lott. I think within all these processes it is critical 
to keep what you highlighted in the beginning in mind--reliable 
and affordable electricity, and anything that affects the grid, 
we should understand the impacts of it.
    The Chairman. But I am saying, if they are not listening--
NERC and FERC are doing their job, but there's no teeth to it 
whatsoever. To give you an example of what we are talking 
about--we have been working on bills here directing the NERC to 
comment on EPA regulations, direct them to comment on your 
regulations. EPA must address NERC's comments before it issues 
a final rule, and then FERC can issue temporary waivers to 
regulations if needed for reliability. So somehow you have to 
have--reliability is going to be the first and foremost for 
people's lives, protect their lives, really, livelihoods and 
lives. And that is what we are asking, if something is needed 
that you all believe, seeing it from your standpoint, in 
legislation that might be helpful to give us more direction of 
reliability, not just changes that are desired.
    Mr. Asthana. Yes, Senator Manchin, I can provide my 
perspective. I think, absolutely--I think actually Senator 
Barrasso is thinking through the SPUR----
    The Chairman. Right.
    Mr. Asthana. SPUR Act. And I think this concept of 
reliability impact statements to inform policy before it is 
made is a great idea. I think, actually, we can go further and 
I can talk about that later, but I think that is needed.
    The Chairman. I think I know how you feel, Mr. Robb.
    Mr. Robb. Well, we do reflect the impact of EPA policy.
    The Chairman. How frustrating is it to you being the head 
of NERC knowing that you are giving, basically, on the facts, 
you are not picking winners or losers. You are not getting 
involved in environmental climates and the fight that goes on, 
what side are you on, basically, just dealing with the facts of 
how you are supposed to deliver the power and no one pays 
attention.
    Mr. Robb. It's frustrating.
    The Chairman. I would think so.
    Okay, Mr. Asthana, how's PJM adjusting to the market rules 
to ensure that you have dispatchable power that is needed to 
run your reliable grid?
    Mr. Asthana. Yes, great question, Senator Manchin. So we 
are taking a lot of actions right now. I think before I get 
into those actions, I just want to note that the markets have 
worked. They actually have delivered reliability. They have 
delivered the dispatchable generation we need for 20 years. And 
I think they will continue to work, but what is different is, 
there is this massive policy pressure. And I am not sure that 
the markets, or actually----
    The Chairman. Explain that massive policy pressure. 
Pressure to what?
    Mr. Asthana. There is----
    The Chairman. Bring on more power, or just, I mean, here, 
bring on renewable? We are all for all-of-the-above.
    Mr. Asthana. Yes----
    The Chairman. Wind, solar, all of this.
    Mr. Asthana. It's really pressure for generators that are 
dispatchable to retire, and the retirement dates are not tied 
to demonstration that the replacement capacity is here. And so, 
it's not----
    The Chairman. Let me ask this question--if you shut down a 
coal-fired plant before it is timed out, and it can still 
produce power 24/7, you are shutting it down because of policy 
pressures. Does the ratepayer still pay since it has been based 
in for a longer period of time to run?
    Mr. Asthana. It depends on the rate regime. So part of PJM 
is restructured, in which case the investors take that risk. In 
the fully regulated, integrated parts of the market, the 
ratepayers take that risk.
    The Chairman. And----
    Mr. Asthana. But so, we are doing a lot to tweak our 
markets and change our markets to make sure we are recognizing 
the attributes that we need for a reliable grid, whether it's 
resource accreditation, or how we run our auctions, or how we 
actually penalize people who don't perform.
    The Chairman. Great.
    Very quickly, I think, Mr. Tudor, you made a comment that 
you don't think that we can meet it in time as far as, you are 
saying, all of this in the queue, all this new energy coming 
on, waiting to get connected, correct? What happens if we do 
not build new transmission lines to carry this and bring it 
into the queue? Does it replace, basically, and if it's not, if 
we don't have the storage and we can't store it, and basically 
it has to be either used or lost, what does that do to 
reliability?
    Mr. Tudor. I believe there is a tipping point that is going 
to occur in 2028 because all the plants that are announced to 
close in 2028, most of these coal plants are tied to specific 
regulations in the EPA. So they are going to close. So you have 
between now and 2028 to come up with solutions, sir. 
Transmission is a solution. Keeping what we have past 2028, to 
maybe 2035, gives us a chance to actually see these 
technologies develop. The first SMR--small modular reactor--is 
scheduled to come on in 2029. That is the first one. And no one 
wants to be number one in new technologies.
    So my concern is we have a gap period here that we have 
this push for all these new renewables, and we have this push 
to shut down plants that work, and there is nothing there in 
the middle to save us, and I fear we are going to have 
blackouts. I am afraid we are going to see a significant number 
of lives lost.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks so much, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Tudor, to follow up, I want you to take a look at a 
chart that I have posted here. We have circled the area in 
green that is the area served by your cooperative and its 
affiliates, as you mentioned, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma.
    [The chart referred to follows:]
    
    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    
    Senator Barrasso. So this chart is from NERC's 2022 Long-
Term Reliability Assessment. It is entitled ``Risk Area Summary 
from 2023 to 2027.'' So red is high risk. Orange represents 
elevated risk. The area that your cooperative serves appears as 
an oasis--surrounded by red and orange, except you are in a 
good spot. So why is your area in such a good spot? What are 
you doing right that your neighbors are not doing right?
    And could you just turn this so the other members can see, 
Senator Cassidy, as well as Senator Murkowski----
    Senator Cassidy. Can you hold it up over Mike Lee's head? 
It's right in the way.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Barrasso. The oasis among----
    Senator Murkowski. And where is Alaska?
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Tudor. Now that's a good question.
    Senator Barrasso. It's where it belongs, above all the 
rest.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Tudor. To answer your question, sir, we have not 
retired our fossil fuel plants, number one. Number two, we 
invest in transmission projects to serve our members to 
maintain affordable electricity to their homes. Our ability to 
also have 200 interconnects with SPP and MISO. We also have 
firm transmission to go across TVA to PJM. So we can access all 
three markets in those times when there are problems. Most of 
you know how storms go from the west, typically, to the east. 
And so, our system sits right in the middle of these markets. 
And what we are concerned about, frankly, is over the next four 
or five years, so much of this coal generation is going to get 
retired in the Midwest, that we believe that both MISO and SPP 
are going to become, more and more, less reliable. And we can't 
just open the breakers and keep them from affecting our system.
    So what we are worried about is, we feel like we have done 
everything we can to protect our membership from a reliability 
standpoint, but those 200 interconnects are both a blessing and 
a curse. They are a blessing, you know, to get extra power when 
we need it, which is very seldom. They are a curse because we 
will have loop flows and, you know, a lot of people do not 
understand what that is, but electricity goes where it wants 
to. You can't make it go a certain direction. So our fear is we 
are going to become less and less reliable, not because of our 
own actions, but because of the actions of others.
    Senator Barrasso. So a few weeks ago, Mr. Tudor, this 
Committee held an oversight hearing. We had the FERC 
Commissioners here. The Chairman had made mention of it. During 
that hearing, Chairman Manchin asked each of the FERC 
Commissioners whether, quote, ``it is possible to eliminate 
coal today or in the near future?'' All four Commissioners 
agreed that we need coal to maintain grid reliability. Do you 
agree with the Commissioners?
    Mr. Tudor. Yes, sir, I agree. And I believe you would hear 
from both MISO and SPP, as PJM has stated, that yes, we need to 
maintain some baseload generation--coal, and natural gas--until 
we can get to a point where there is a new technology that can 
replace it.
    Senator Barrasso. And that is specifically for your own 
cooperative as well as across the nation?
    Mr. Tudor. It's the United States, sir.
    Senator Barrasso. Thanks.
    Mr. Robb, your organization's 2023 Summer Reliability 
Assessment shows risks spreading to even more regions than the 
assessment from last year, and your 2022 Long-Term Reliability 
Assessment showed much of the country at higher elevated risk, 
worse this year. So as utilities and cooperatives face greater 
pressure to retire coal and nuclear and even natural gas power 
plants, the grid faces even greater risk, as indicated by your 
chart. Based on these trends, is the electric grid at greater 
risk of failure today than it was, say, 10 years ago, in 2013?
    Mr. Robb. Unquestionably.
    Senator Barrasso. So I won't ask you to predict what is 
going to happen, but if current trends continue, what would you 
project the state of the grid to be five years from now, in 
2028?
    Mr. Robb. Well, since you have both showed our maps, if the 
trends continue as they are today, we are going to see more of 
the country in orange and increasing areas in red. So more 
elevated risk across the country, more red areas of high risk. 
And when we do our next reliability assessment, we will be 
baking in all these coal retirements that we are talking about 
today, and that is going to make almost the entire map orange.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, Mr. Chairman, I am out of time. 
Thank you. I will go a second round.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Now we will go to Senator Heinrich.
    Senator Heinrich. Thank you, Chairman.
    Dr. Lott, a recent study commissioned by ERCOT, the 
Electric Reliability Council of Texas, that I have here, 
indicates that the reliability of conventional fossil fuel 
thermal electric generation was reduced in cold years, 
particularly cold winters, like the years we had in 2011 and 
2021, by about 20 to 30 percent. So this is the thermal 
generation that we are all talking about, but in particularly 
cold winters, like 2011 and 2021, they saw a 20 to 30 percent 
decrease in reliability due to correlated outages that are 
caused by extreme weather events. In general, are we talking 
enough about the reliability of conventional gas and coal 
plants being overestimated in those windows, given the 
demonstrated risk from correlated outages?
    Dr. Lott. In general, we are not spending enough time 
looking at the trade-offs and risks across all the different 
technologies and how they pair together, and to a point that 
was made earlier, also the systems that are connected to them. 
You can have a natural gas plant, which will have its own 
risks, as one example. You also have to think about the entire 
fuel supply chain, so the pipelines, the storage, the 
wellheads.
    Senator Heinrich. Yes, the valves that get stuck.
    Dr. Lott. All of it.
    Senator Heinrich. Would it have been helpful during events 
like Winter Storm Uri if Texas could have actually imported 
bulk power from neighboring markets?
    Dr. Lott. The ability to import is one additional tool in 
the toolbox. In the middle of an extreme event, you want every 
tool available to you. So the fact that they had limited 
ability to do that meant that they had one less tool to work 
with.
    Senator Heinrich. Mr. Asthana, as of 2022, PJM had one of 
the largest interconnection backlogs in the nation for new 
generation and storage projects. I believe it was about 280 
gigawatts, at least according to the Lawrence Berkeley National 
Lab report that I saw. As you and others have pointed out, this 
backlog and the inability to add new generation sources on the 
grid is a challenge for reliability and for our ability to 
transition to cleaner resources. I am curious, do you think 
that FERC's NOPR to address interconnection backlog issues is 
on the right track, and in addition, when you say 
interconnection reform, what specifically does that mean to 
you? What does that look like, in particular?
    Mr. Asthana. Yes, great questions. I will take the second 
one first. The queues are full. And we need to get through 
them. There is no question about it. They are full because they 
are full of projects, some of which are going to go, and many 
of which are speculative. And we have to separate them and do 
our engineering work on the ones that are going to go. And so 
that is a lot of our reform that we have put in place right 
now, and it should get us through the queue in the next few 
years.
    Now, in terms of the FERC NOPR, we were in----
    Senator Heinrich. So specifically, you are saying if you 
just separate--I mean, how do you separate those two buckets? 
Because sometimes people are, you know, what one person, what 
one developer calls speculation, another developer says no, we 
are putting that in the queue because we are betting that we 
can get a connection at that location.
    Mr. Asthana. Yes.
    Senator Heinrich. How do you separate those two buckets of 
speculative, and things that from your point of view are ready 
to go?
    Mr. Asthana. Our solution requires demonstration of site 
control. So you have to show that you have the land and control 
of the site.
    Senator Heinrich. Yes.
    Mr. Asthana. And you have to be willing to put down 
financial deposits that are at risk to show that you are 
serious.
    Senator Heinrich. Great. That is helpful.
    Mr. Asthana. And with regard to the FERC NOPR, in concept, 
we were supportive of it. We provided extensive comments. There 
were parts of it that we suggested needed tweaking, but I do 
think more proactive planning of the grid is going to speed up 
interconnection.
    Senator Heinrich. Mr. Robb, do you agree?
    Mr. Robb. I agree with that. The one thing that we have 
pushed on from our perspective with the FERC NOPR is to ensure 
that inverter-based resources are correctly modeled before they 
are----
    Senator Heinrich. Right.
    Mr. Robb. And that has been a big issue.
    Senator Heinrich. You have indicated that the rapid growth 
of inverter-based renewable energy on the grid poses challenges 
for the bulk power system. However, I was looking at NERC's 
2022 report, the Inverter-Based Resource Strategy, and it 
actually says, implemented correctly, inverter technology can 
provide significant benefits to the bulk power system. Is there 
a disconnect there?
    Mr. Robb. No, there is a big proviso in there of being 
integrated correctly, and the key issue here, the major issue 
with inverters is to make sure that they are able to ride 
through minor grid disturbances. We have seen a couple major 
events, most recently in West Texas, where a minor disturbance 
on the grid that would have cleared itself automatically caused 
a number of inverters to panic, if you will, and trip off the 
system. And since they all see that, we end up having very 
large outages. So in the most recent West Texas event, a minor 
disturbance that would have been cleared naturally resulted in 
1,700 megawatts of inverters tripping off the system. That 
resulted in 800 megawatts of conventional generation tripping 
off the system. We lost two and a half gigawatts, which is two 
and a half nuclear units.
    Senator Heinrich. Right.
    Mr. Robb. And put ERCOT very, very close to having to shed 
load.
    Senator Heinrich. Thank you.
    Thank you, Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Now we have Senator Lee.
    Senator Lee. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for 
organizing this hearing. Thanks to each of you for coming here 
to enlighten us.
    You know, it has become very popular to talk about the 
negative impacts of using coal and natural gas, but we really 
should have a conversation about the extent to which we rely on 
them, and about the positive impacts of using them, and the 
fact that the American people benefit from them in ways that 
can't simply be overlooked and dismissed. The reality is that 
human beings are able to survive and thrive much more readily, 
much more comfortably, and much more affordably because of 
affordable and plentiful and reliable power, primarily coming 
from natural gas and from coal.
    And so, the advantage that fossil fuel electric power 
generation provides isn't something that we can just ignore. 
It's something that makes it not only affordable, but also 
available on demand as baseload power on a consistent basis. We 
all benefit from that, from being able to walk into a room and 
turn on the light switch and know that the lights are going to 
come on and it will be affordable and reliable. Sadly, we are 
seeing an all-of-government-approach war on reliable power 
waged by unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in the Biden 
Administration. It's just one of many examples. The Biden EPA 
has been on a crusade against coal-fired power plants, imposing 
crippling new regulations in what seems like every single week.
    Mr. Robb, I would like to start with you.
    NERC, the organization that you lead, is the reliability 
watchdog for the grid. Is that fair to say?
    Mr. Robb. It is a fair characterization.
    Senator Lee. And I think most of us can agree that coal-
fired power plants are being retired prematurely, which is 
especially alarming when you look at the realities on the 
ground, when you consider things like the fact that when 
replacement baseload power supply has not been brought online, 
we need to be worried about this. Tell me why this trend should 
be troubling to us, or is it troubling to you?
    Mr. Robb. It is highly troubling because we are retiring 
these plants before their attributes are being fully replaced. 
And their attributes are more than just the energy that they 
produce. One of the important things, it is a little esoteric, 
but one of the important things that these plants provide is 
the ability for the grid to maintain voltage and maintain 
frequency and to resist disturbances. Other resources can't do 
that nearly as well as large, spinning mass generation. And 
that is why the loss of coal plants and natural gas plants and 
nuclear plants is so concerning from a grid reliability 
perspective.
    Senator Lee. Okay, so it goes beyond cost. It is about 
reliability, and without reliability, we lose some significant 
benefits. Now, requests for future generation published by the 
large regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, show that 
the vast majority of projected future generation additions are 
going to come from wind and from solar. For example, within 
MISO, one of the largest RTOs, solar and wind comprise 64 
percent of new generator requests, while natural gas comprises 
only three percent of those requests. Given the retirement of 
dispatchable power, will this ratio of new wind and solar 
projects on the one hand, to natural gas-fired projects on the 
other hand, be sufficient to meet the need, the demand for 
reliable power in the coming decades?
    Mr. Robb. It will be highly problematic without reinforcing 
the natural gas system, which is very, very important for 
integrating renewables and/or the eventual development and 
deployment of long-duration energy storage, which, as yet, does 
not exist at scale.
    Senator Lee. Right.
    Mr. Tudor, you lead a large electric cooperative. I have 
been very interested in your work and I am interested in your 
thoughts on why coal-powered plants are being forced to retire 
as they are, and why investment in new natural gas plants is 
seeming to be stifled. Tell me, do regulations like the EPA's 
Good Neighbor Plan, do they make blackouts more likely or less 
likely?
    Mr. Tudor. More likely. Any premature retirement of 
something that works without having something that doesn't work 
to replace it seems dangerous to me and illogical. So yes, 
there has been a continuous push to retire fossil fuel plants, 
mainly coal, and now move on to natural gas plants. And what it 
has done is, it has----
    Senator Lee. Move on to them, meaning?
    Mr. Tudor. Retire them.
    Senator Lee. To retire them?
    Mr. Tudor. Yes, sir. Or not even build any, and you know, 
people are afraid to try and build something that is fossil 
when the EPA regs continue to come out that are negative to an 
investment of any kind in fossil fuels. So if you are sitting 
here going, am I going to build a windmill or am I going to 
build a gas plant? I am going to build a windmill. Why? Because 
you can, as it will be very difficult for that three percent 
that we are talking about here of new natural gas plants to get 
permitted, get in the queue, and get connected to the grid and 
actually get built and completed. And it takes five or six 
years now to build a brand-new natural gas plant, where it used 
to take two to three.
    Senator Lee. In the meantime, they are not replacing that 
with nuclear power, traditional or small modular nuclear. They 
are not replacing that----
    Mr. Tudor. They can't yet----
    Senator Lee. With geothermal or hydroelectric.
    Mr. Tudor. They can't yet because the technology is not 
there yet. I mean, there is a big difference between capacity, 
which is the ability to deliver energy, and energy. So if you 
take a wind product, which I am not against wind, but wind, in 
general, gets about 15 percent capacity credit in the RTOs, 
where a coal plant gets around 80 percent capacity in an RTO. 
What that means is, the coal plant produces and runs 80 percent 
of the time and the wind farm runs 15 percent of the time. When 
it's windy, the wind produces a lot of energy, which is a good 
thing. When it's not, you virtually have nothing, and you have 
to rely, as Mr. Robb is saying, you have to rely on something 
that is baseload to maintain the integrity of the service, 
basically, to our consumers.
    Senator Lee. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    And now, we have Senator King.
    Senator King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    As I have been listening to this hearing, it occurs to me 
there is an irony and a paradox embedded in the hearing. We 
have heard the word premature about a hundred times. The 
question is, and I will quote the testimony of Dr. Lott: ``The 
American Society of Civil Engineers identify severe weather as 
the predominant cause of customer outage.'' Right? It's in your 
testimony. We are in a race with climate change. And we are 
talking about outages that are caused predominantly by severe 
weather, which is a result of climate change. So the question 
is--premature? Actually, we should have been making this 
transition years ago, and we are trying to make it in a hurry 
because we are in a crisis situation.
    For the last million years, CO<INF>2</INF> in the 
atmosphere averaged about 260 to 270 parts per million. 
Starting at about 1850, that started to rise steadily. Today, 
it is at 424 parts per million. I remember ten years ago, when 
I entered this body, it was under 400, and everybody said 400 
is a tipping point. We are at 424 today. That is a 60 percent 
rise in about 150 years. And by the way, the last time we were 
at over 400 parts per million was three million years ago and 
the ocean was 60 feet higher. So the question is--and I 
understand that it seems to me the heart of this hearing is 
timing--and is it--what is the time period? Is it five years, 
or ten years?
    Mr. Robb, I understand the testimony, and basically what 
you are saying is that we are trying to transition too fast. My 
question on this--an honest question--is, what is the right 
time period that we should be aiming at?
    Mr. Robb. It's a terrific question and it's a very tough 
policy problem and I have sympathy----
    Senator King. Can the record show that terrific question 
quote, please?
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Robb. I believe, and I think most people studying the 
energy systems say you need to keep balance between 
affordability, reliability, and climate. And if one gets out of 
whack then bad things start to happen. And I think your 
question, at its roots, is how much do you value having 24/7 
energy available to support the way of life we have all become 
accustomed to?
    Senator King. And how do you avoid the crisis that will 
overwhelm any electric system?
    Mr. Robb. And that is the question of balance that 
policymakers need to figure out and pursue.
    Senator King. So can you give me a year? Is it five years? 
Is it ten years? Should we----
    Mr. Robb. I think it depends----
    Senator King [continuing]. Slow the retirement of coal 
plants which are definitely----
    Mr. Robb. Yes, Senator, I think it depends on what you 
believe about our ability to create batteries or other forms of 
storage that can create synthetic dispatchability from 
intermittent resources like wind and solar.
    Senator King. It's not synthetic dispatchability. It is 
dispatchability. You have batteries plus renewables. That is a 
baseload plant.
    Mr. Robb. And the question is, at what time do we have the 
duration that we need, because right now, a four-hour lithium-
ion battery is incredibly helpful to the grid. It does not 
solve the wind drought problem.
    Senator King. I completely understand that. So the question 
is, how fast can we develop the battery or the storage 
technology, whatever it is, whether it is pumped storage or 
something else, versus the contribution to the severe weather 
events which are also--we are talking about this hearing as if 
the only risk is the lack of capacity, when in reality, the 
risk is severe weather events. So we have got to try to beat--
--
    Mr. Robb. And the issue is, they are correlated, right? And 
we need to recognize that and find the right balance between 
them, but I think people need to understand that the scale of 
this industry is enormous. So last year we put 20 gigawatts of 
solar onto the system. That is the most we have ever put on in 
a single year.
    Senator King. That is only going to accelerate.
    Mr. Robb. And that is only about two percent of the 
capacity of the United States. So with everything that we have 
done to speed the development of renewables and so forth, with 
the static grid, we are on a 50- to 75-year trajectory to 
replace it. And the grid is not static because we are also 
trying to electrify transportation. That is a very smart thing 
to do. Space heating----
    Senator King. I am running out of time, but for the record, 
I would like you to give me a number of years. How long should 
we delay the retirement of the fossil fuel plants, bearing in 
mind the acceleration of the climate race?
    Mr. Robb. I am going to disappoint you, Senator. I can't 
give you a year, but we should not retire them until they are 
replaced.
    Senator King. Well, we have got to make decisions here as 
to--this hearing is about delaying the retirement. I want to 
know how long and how that relates to the rest of the risk.
    The other point I want to make, Mr. Chairman, we had a very 
informative hearing just before the break about small modular 
reactors, and this country is falling behind in that 
technology. There is a danger of us losing whatever advantage 
we might have. I think we are going to need a CHIPS and Science 
Act II with regard to the development of small modular reactors 
to accelerate that development here in this country because 
that will answer many of the issues that we are discussing 
today, both climate and reliability.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you for calling this important hearing.
    The Chairman. Very important. Thank you.
    Senator Cassidy.
    Senator Cassidy. Well, I think if there is a lesson here, I 
mean, if there is a mental lesson, it is that the regulatory 
state is often conflicted and the regulatory state has created 
an environment with goals that are mutually incompatible. Mr. 
Tudor, you mentioned how the regulations are effectively 
forcing the retirement of coal-fired plants and inhibiting the 
development of natural gas. We have a limitation from the 
bureaucratic state of permitting for power lines, which would 
allow electrons to go from one place to the other. My Chairman 
mentioned in his opening statements how EPA is not approving 
carbon storage projects. And yet, theoretically, we are trying 
to decrease the carbon footprint of all these projects. You 
know, of course, the line from Pogo always comes to mind in 
this situation--``we have met the enemy and he is us.'' Except 
this time, to be more specific, it is the bureaucratic state.
    So I will say on a bipartisan basis, I think that a 
regulatory reform bill would actually be incredibly helpful. 
That could actually help develop goals that are mutually held 
by both sides if we want to achieve anything, because right 
now, Mr. Tudor, you are suggesting we are headed for a train 
wreck. Now, if you noticed on that thing that Senator Lee's 
head was blocking earlier, I was trying to get around his ears 
to see----
    The Chairman. We have been trying that for a long time.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Cassidy. Louisiana was just part of the MISO 
considered at high risk. We do not have that much dispatchable 
renewable, but we obviously have a lot of storms coming off the 
Gulf and I assume that is why we were considered at high risk.
    In the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill, Mr. Robb, there was 
$3 billion for distributed energy, $3 billion to harden the 
grid, and $3 billion to tie the two together. Now, what do you 
see as the potential for this distributed energy build-out to 
give resiliency to these weather events that Senator King was 
speaking of?
    Mr. Robb. I think the movement to push more generation 
closer to load is a good one, right? And I think distributed 
generation, as you are referring to, is a positive trend. The 
challenge with it is that most of that distributed energy is 
coming on in the form of inverters--largely photovoltaic, some 
wind, and eventually we are going to see more and more 
batteries. We need to make sure that those inverters play 
nicely with the rest of the----
    Senator Cassidy. Now, I was told by somebody who is very 
much into this, so you always have to kind of understand, you 
hear from different sources, that if you took a microgrid, 
connect it to a battery, that would give you four hours of 
power, which may be enough to get you back up. The thought came 
when you mentioned how in West Texas, the inverter flipped off, 
but if it was storing into the battery then putting it right 
back on. Would that not have dealt with the issue?
    Mr. Robb. The combination of inverter resources and 
batteries is a very powerful one, but you need to be cognizant 
of the scale and duration of protection that you are getting. 
Four hours is four hours, which is terrific if you have a 
three-and-a-half-hour event. If you have a two-week outage 
associated with a major hurricane, if you have six weeks of 
cloud cover that you can't generate from, you need longer 
duration storage than four hours.
    Senator Cassidy. So it's part of the solution, but it's not 
the solution?
    Mr. Robb. It's definitely part of the solution, but other 
things need to happen around it.
    Senator Cassidy. Let me just ask you, do you agree with Mr. 
Tudor that the EPA's regulations are forcing the early 
retirement of assets, and that we, in no way under the current 
regulatory regime, have any possibility of replacing it with 
suitable renewables and transmission to make up for it?
    Mr. Robb. Not in the timeframe that we are looking at, no.
    Senator Cassidy. So you agree with his testimony in the 
main?
    Mr. Robb. I do.
    Senator Cassidy. And Mr. Asthana, do you agree?
    Mr. Asthana. I do agree we need to hang on to resources 
that we have today that work until their replacement is here.
    Senator Cassidy. And would you also agree that the 
regulatory state is basically making that impossible? You are a 
regulated industry, so you may be a little hesitant, but you 
can just surreptitiously nod your head yes.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Asthana. Well, I was trying to give you a thoughtful 
answer. I have said the policy pressure is what is pushing most 
of this generation off. So that is true. I was really 
hesitating because the most recent EPA rule is a proposal, and 
so I am not sure where it will end up, but if it ends up the 
way it is, it will continue to push this generation off the 
grid.
    Senator Cassidy. I think Mr. Tudor's point, that even their 
proposal ends up guiding bond markets--James Carville said he 
once wanted to come back as a bond market, because everybody 
listened to the bond market. So who is going to float a bond 
for fossil? I think that was Mr. Tudor's point.
    And Dr. Lott, would you agree with all that?
    Dr. Lott. I think the system is not set up right now to 
support, at the speed we need, the diverse mix of technologies 
we need. If you want a reliable and affordable grid in any 
future scenario, you want a mix of things. You want variable 
renewables like wind and solar. They are very cheap when they 
are around. We want to complement it with energy storage, both 
batteries for these short periods of time, and the long 
duration we are establishing. We also want firm dispatchable 
power. And I say that as a group of technologies. This could be 
geothermal, hydro----
    Senator Cassidy. I accept that, but it also means that we 
are going to have to have regulatory reform if we hope to 
achieve that. Would you agree with that, in the time required?
    Dr. Lott. We need processes that can provide transparency 
and speediness so that we can build things, yes.
    Senator Cassidy. And do we have that now?
    Dr. Lott. Our processes are not set up to do the number of 
things we are trying to do.
    Senator Cassidy. I will just finish by saying that should 
be the challenge of this Committee, to come up with that 
regulatory reform bill on a bipartisan basis.
    I yield.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Now we have Senator Hickenlooper, from the great State of 
Colorado.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thanks to 
all of you for your work and for being here. I think this has 
been very useful. I did want to point out Walt Kelly's great 
quote--that was my father's favorite cartoon, Pogo--but the 
reason that is so famous is, in 1970, he put that on an 
environmental poster and he was really talking about the causes 
of pollution and environmental challenges that we have created. 
He also--what is the other one we had here? ``Having lost sight 
of our objectives, we redoubled our efforts,'' which is 
something that this Committee has to be very careful of. Also, 
he said that ``we are confronted with insurmountable 
opportunities.'' I could go down the long list.
    Anyway, that is neither here nor there.
    Mr. Asthana, I saw in your testimony that PJM is over a 
quarter of a million megawatts. That has been brought up a 
couple different times, as we discuss. The PJM's recent 
analysis identified several concerning trends that could result 
in a capacity shortfall, as you recognize. You also consider 
different scenarios regarding how quickly you could bring on 
new generation. Can you talk a little bit about the ``high new 
entry'' scenario in which you are able to get a lot of 
generation out of interconnection queues and onto the grid? How 
does that impact the risk of blackouts and future 
interruptions?
    Mr. Asthana. Yes, thank you for that question--great 
question.
    So we have said we see 40,000 megawatts at risk of retiring 
by 2030. To replace it, we need 100,000 megawatts of the 
intermittent variation. We have 250,000 in the queue, so it's 
doable, right? Our interconnection reform will move that 
generation through the queue in time to get built. The problem 
is, the completion rates of those projects are really low. So 
we are going to need to get 50 to 60 percent completion rates 
when we are seeing five to ten percent because of issues like 
supply chain constraints, permitting, and the like. So it's 
doable, but I would not want to bet the farm that it will be 
done given the current trends. I think we need to push to get 
it done, but I think we need to not burn the boat in terms of 
the generation that we have in the meanwhile.
    Senator Hickenlooper. All right, thank you.
    And as Senator King pointed out, and you have all pointed 
out that the pressure that is coming to make these changes more 
rapidly really is coming from the public. I mean, the EPA, in 
many regards, is feeling that pressure, which is the occurrence 
of extreme weather. I have my master's--now it's almost 50 
years' old--in earth and environmental science, and you go 
back, and back then we called it the greenhouse effect, but as 
early as the mid to late 1980s, we began predicting extreme 
weather was going to be a consequence of climate change as we 
saw it. When I first became Mayor of Denver in 2003, we had 
some of the worst wildfires we'd ever had. They have only 
gotten worse, continuously, in a cycle.
    The question I have for each of you, if we are going to do 
this properly and measure, as Senator King was describing, how 
do we balance reliability with the urgency to address climate 
change before the extreme weather accelerates to a point where 
we really can't deal with it, which is not impossible to 
imagine. Do you think a price on carbon helps us assess--
increase the system where we can assess these competing 
urgencies that I think we are all faced with right now?
    Why don't we start with you, Mr. Tudor, and we can go right 
down the list.
    Mr. Tudor. Well, selfishly, I don't want to pay any more 
taxes.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Well, if the money was all given back 
as a dividend.
    Mr. Tudor. Sure, I understand.
    You know, in the past, tradable markets have had a positive 
effect on the reduction of emissions.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. They have.
    Mr. Tudor. Yes, sir.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Dr. Lott.
    Dr. Lott. So one of my colleagues at the Center on Global 
Energy Policy, Dr. Noah Coffin, works on this quite a bit. 
Putting a price on these things, as you say, has succeeded in 
the past when it comes to addressing things like acid rain, and 
it is one tool that can be deployed.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes, and I do not underestimate the 
complexity of getting to doing this in a way that would be 
perceived as fair and just.
    Mr. Asthana.
    Mr. Asthana. Yes, I do think a price on carbon can get us 
to a more efficient solution to carbon mitigation.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great.
    Mr. Robb. As NERC, I don't think we have a point of view on 
that----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes, I would have to come up with a 
more political problem, probably than it needs to be or should 
be, and it certainly was generated by Republicans and 
Democrats, but I keep circling back because so many people in 
Congress have given up on it, and it is the one sure way to 
find out a solution whereby government gets their finger off 
the scale, and where we let some of these systems that we all 
recognize are complex but important that allow the system to 
generate its own priorities.
    Mr. Tudor.
    Mr. Tudor. I would prefer that to the latest EPA rule on 
111(b) and (d) because what that does is exactly what you are 
saying, is it forces things into unintended consequences. I 
would much rather have a market to cause that versus unintended 
consequences of set rules that will require retirements.
    Senator Hickenlooper. I understand that, and I appreciate 
what Dr. Lott said in terms of as we look at revisiting the 
processes that we use to look at that type of rulemaking. How 
do we make sure that we can maintain the transparency? We can 
accelerate the time, but we have got to make sure we protect 
the role of the public in having an opportunity to discuss 
their own future as well.
    I yield back to the Ranking Member.
    Senator Barrasso [presiding]. Thank you, Senator 
Hickenlooper.
    Senator Hyde-Smith.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Senator Barrasso, and thank 
you all for being here today. This has been so helpful, and 
obviously we have a lot of challenges in front of us that are 
very, very critical.
    Mr. Tudor, I am going to direct my question to you. The 
strains on the nation's electric grid, to the electric sector, 
continue to be plagued by the things you talked about--the 
supply chain issues, the labor shortages, the natural 
disasters, the reliance on foreign countries for equipment and 
so on. We are also seeing that the challenges facing our grid 
infrastructure are only heightened by the aggressive green 
agenda being pursued by the Biden Administration. So from your 
perspective, can you just talk about the consequences that the 
American people will see if these issues are left unaddressed?
    Mr. Tudor. I apologize, are you asking me?
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Yes.
    Mr. Tudor. Okay. Very good question. Difficult to answer. I 
have to revert back to probably the largest issues. Supply 
chain challenges are worse than they have ever been. Minerals 
to actually create renewable projects are 70 to 80 percent 
managed and controlled by China. You have to get--you have to 
construct things. So when we talk about implementation, the 
first thing we have to do is we have to invent and develop, and 
then ultimately deploy whatever resource we are talking about, 
whether it's wind, solar, or batteries. And I agree with Dr. 
Lott, we just don't--it's just not prime time yet. We are not 
ready. And we have had some unique things happen to have caused 
this to slow down. A big one being COVID, which created the 
supply chain challenges, a strong economy led to that, and this 
growth spurt.
    And so, I think that we need to answer Senator King's 
question. I think we need until at least 2040 to maintain 
fossil fuel plants and make a smooth transition to a cleaner 
United States. That doesn't fix the world, it will just fix the 
United States, because China is going to continue to build coal 
plants.
    Did that help, did that answer your question?
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Yes.
    Mr. Tudor. Thank you.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. And also to you, you know, with the 
Winter Storm Elliot strike that we had in the Southeast, you 
know, there were certainly reliability problems and concerns, 
including the rolling blackouts. And it seemed that the region 
recovered pretty quickly, but the customers did not see the 
extreme economic impact like they did in Texas or that they 
might see in a market like New England that lacks firm gas. So 
do you attribute this, in part, maybe, to the market structure 
in the Southeast or specifically the vertically integrated 
bilateral market?
    Mr. Tudor. Storms are unpredictable, and we have actually 
looked back at our region and looked at weather trends. And 
when was the coldest day in Missouri, Oklahoma, and Iowa? It 
was actually in 1989, not in December 2022. What happened in 
the Southeast is somewhat unique, as well as Texas, because 
they are not used to these storms dipping down as deep and as 
cold. So what we experienced in Elliot was, effectively, 20 and 
30 degrees below zero with wind chills and wind up to 50 miles 
an hour. Very unique storm. It has happened before, but the 
southeast effectively, I think, got caught by the same thing 
all of us got caught by, and that is bad weather forecasting. I 
think most utilities in the United States during storm Elliot 
missed their load forecast. And when everybody misses their 
load forecast--Jim knows what that means--you are short 
everywhere of generation. And if you don't have that generation 
on and operating before the storm, it's very difficult to get 
that generation to come on during a storm.
    So from a market construct standpoint, I continue to 
advocate that we allow the RTOs to actually bring on baseload 
generation in front of a storm and curtail other forms of 
energy for that window of time where they need to get the 
baseload generation up and running in advance of a storm.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you.
    And I have another question, but I will submit it. Thank 
you.
    The Chairman [presiding]. Thank you, Senator.
    And now we have Senator Cortez Masto.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I agree 
with my colleagues. This has been a really informative 
discussion.
    Let me follow up because this is the question I was going 
to ask you, Mr. Tudor, was what is the appropriate time frame? 
And you said 2040. Why 2040?
    Mr. Tudor. First of all, I do not think hydrogen or carbon 
capture will be ready any time soon. I think our best 
opportunity for having a real resource that can replace fossil 
fuel plants is small modular reactors, which is nuclear. The 
problem there is the permitting process, and the cost that 
these organizations have to spend to get through that 
permitting process is enormous, and ultimately, that results in 
a cost of a small modular nuclear reactor close to ten times 
more expensive than a brand-new gas-fired plant. Over time, I 
think those costs will come down, but they need the time to 
develop that product--develop it, deploy it, test it, so it can 
be financeable. Banks are not going to loan money on something 
that they don't know whether it works or not, especially in 
advance, when your cost curve is so high and over so many 
years.
    The first SMR scheduled to come online is in 2029 with a 
company called NuScale. We have signed a letter of intent with 
NuScale, specifically, as well as GE Hitachi to track this 
technology and consider it, but we do not see it happening 
until 2035, and we do not even know if it works yet.
    Senator Cortez Masto. So let me ask you this. And it goes 
back to what Senator King was saying, is we knew about extreme 
weather impacting and making this change in directing us to do 
something years ago. So if the Administration does not put out 
some sort of incentive or goal marker or something out there, 
how can we ensure the industry and people--it's not just the 
Federal Government, right? The regulation comes at the state 
level, public utility commissions, local regulation, we all 
know that. How do we ensure, in the industry, that everybody is 
going to work toward that goal?
    And so, I guess this is a question for Dr. Lott because you 
touch on this in your testimony, and I appreciate that, which 
is this idea that there is a role at the federal level. The 
U.S. regulatory framework for the electricity sector is 
overseen by state legislatures and public utility or service 
commissions, but you identify that the Federal Government has a 
role. And then you list a number of things. One of the things 
you talk about is that Congress could consider strengthening 
requirements for risk assessment and mitigation planning and 
power sector planning processes. Can you discuss that? And 
would that address what we are trying to achieve here, without 
putting a time--we need an off-ramp of some sort and for 
everybody to be a part of this--would that help pull in this 
conversation of what we need to be thinking about?
    Dr. Lott. Thank you for the question. It's a great one. 
When we talk about the integration of how we plan our energy 
systems, what I am highlighting in my testimony is that we have 
tools available today. They exist largely within our national 
labs, specifically Argonne National Lab. I will give an example 
in a second, where we can do energy systems planning and we use 
those models in conjunction with climate models that capture 
these changes that are already happening, that are already in 
progress today in a way that allows us to design a system that 
will be reliable, resilient, and affordable moving forward.
    Right now, those models don't talk to each other. The 
specific example I was alluding to is a partnership between the 
New York Power Authority and Argonne National Lab, to actually 
do this kind of risk assessment. We have seen this done outside 
of the energy sector for the telecommunications sector, 
Florida, AT&T. How should we build out our network of wires 
there to keep coms up? And we can do that now for the energy 
system, so we aren't--not seeing risks that we already are 
facing today and therefore unable to invest----
    Senator Cortez Masto. But not all power authorities are 
doing this.
    Dr. Lott. No.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Not all power authorities are 
partnering with labs to do this risk modeling, correct?
    Dr. Lott. And there is a tremendous opportunity to make it 
so that those risks have to be included and have to be 
considered.
    Senator Cortez Masto. And there is a role for Congress to 
play to----
    Dr. Lott. Absolutely.
    Senator Cortez Masto [continuing]. Incentivize somehow or--
--
    Dr. Lott. Yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto [continuing]. Mandate that type of 
modeling being done?
    Dr. Lott. Because the risks are happening. We have the 
science and modeling and technology to assess it. So there is 
an opportunity for Congress to act to make sure that we are 
assessing that risk.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Okay. That is helpful.
    Yes, go ahead.
    Mr. Asthana. Senator Cortez Masto, I wanted to answer part 
of your question around timing as well. More than half of our 
queue is solar. Solar works. It is here today. We need to 
accelerate it. I mean, I do not think it's a binary thing where 
we will get to a date and we will be ready. I think we are 
going to transition. The transition is happening now. I think 
we need to make the new generation come faster. It's just a 
question of the existing generation that firms the grid. I 
think we need it. It will probably run less as the new 
generation comes in because the new generation has a zero 
marginal cost. So we will dispatch it first, but when it dries 
up, when we do not have sun, we do need the backup. So that is 
the issue. I do not think we should think of it as there is a 
date and then we will be ready. I think it's happening now.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Mr. Robb, do you feel the same way?
    Mr. Robb. I agree with that. I think keeping the foot on 
the gas and the deployment of renewable generation, deployment 
of batteries, development of new technologies, such as small 
modular reactors, long-duration storage, all that needs to be 
pursued at an extraordinary pace. We just need to keep the 
other stuff around because we need to have that ``in case of 
emergency, break glass'' capacity we can rely on.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    Excuse me, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Tudor has one response to 
that, is that all right? I know my time is up.
    The Chairman. Let it go.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Okay.
    Mr. Tudor.
    Mr. Tudor. I think the IRA funding will actually be the 
incentive that is needed to continue this path for the 
development of renewables. I don't think you need anything 
else. I think it's going to cause it.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Now we have Senator Hoeven.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. We are so blessed. We are so blessed with 
your arrival.
    Senator Hoeven. Well, I wanted to be here for you.
    The Chairman. I know.
    Senator Hoeven. Okay.
    So Mr. Robb, on May 4, FERC Commissioner Mark Christie 
testified before this Committee that the United States is 
headed for a reliability crisis. Commissioner Danly also 
emphasized that concern in his testimony before this Committee 
as well. Do you agree with Commissioners Christie and Danly?
    Mr. Robb. I do.
    Senator Hoeven. Mr. Asthana, do you agree as well?
    Mr. Asthana. I did not hear the quote, sir.
    Senator Hoeven. That we are headed for--both Christie and 
Danly have said that the United States is heading for a 
reliability crisis.
    Mr. Asthana. I do think there is an increasing risk of 
that.
    Senator Hoeven. Mr. Tudor, would you agree with that?
    Mr. Tudor. Yes, sir, I do, and sometimes people forget that 
electricity is our way of life, and without electricity, we do 
not have water.
    Senator Hoeven. Good point.
    Dr. Lott, do you agree with that?
    Dr. Lott. I agree that we are not making the investments we 
need to maintain a reliable system.
    Senator Hoeven. Mr. Robb, Mr. Asthana, and Mr. Tudor, in 
each of your written testimonies, you note significant concerns 
over the retirement of on-demand, dispatchable generation. Now, 
in my State of North Dakota, we have a 700-year supply of coal, 
just in my state, and we are leading the nation forward in 
carbon capture and storage technology. We are already doing it 
at a plant at Dakota Gasification Company that converts lignite 
coal to natural gas and also to fertilizer and produces other 
important elements as well, like krypton and xenon and so 
forth. Huge plant. Half its CO<INF>2</INF> will go for tertiary 
oil recovery--and already is--and the other half will be carbon 
capture. We have another plant that is investor-owned that is 
advancing with carbon capture and we have another one that is 
owned by a cooperative that is advancing with carbon capture.
    Doesn't it make sense for us to do everything we can to 
help deploy those carbon capture technologies to keep that 
baseload on the grid for reliability when we have done that 
with SO<INF>X</INF>, we've done that with NO<INF>X</INF>, we've 
done that with mercury. And now we are doing it with 
CO<INF>2</INF>. So rather than just coming out and saying, 
well, we can't have this kind of fuel or we can't have that 
kind of fuel or we have to retire this baseload and we can only 
have this, wouldn't it make sense to continue to advance the 
technology, not only because it will address the situation here 
in this country, but because the rest of the world will adopt 
it as well? Isn't that a better solution than just shutting 
down plants?
    Mr. Robb. I think investments that enable the continued 
operation of coal plants or natural gas plants would be an 
extraordinarily valuable technology for us to have and deploy.
    Senator Hoeven. Right.
    And isn't it myopic if we just sit here and say, well, we 
are going to shut down our plants while China continues to 
build more and more and more? And there are a lot of other 
countries in the world that have an impact on the global 
climate, wouldn't you say?
    Mr. Robb. I would agree that it's the same air.
    Senator Hoeven. Okay.
    Mr. Asthana, what is your thought on that question?
    Mr. Asthana. Yes, I think carbon capture sequestration is a 
critical technology because our fossil reserves are a huge 
national security advantage for us. And I will say this, I 
think the most recent EPA proposed rule is trying to actually 
promote carbon capture and sequestration, but it is on a date 
certain, and it is not clear to me that the technology will be 
ready on that date, but I do think we need to keep pushing.
    Senator Hoeven. Mr. Tudor, what are your thoughts, and 
there's a difference between talking about it and making sure 
that you help people do it, right? You might want to add on 
that component as well.
    Mr. Tudor. Yes, sir, we----
    Senator Hoeven. In other words, if you're putting 
regulations in place all the time that prevent somebody from 
doing it, and then you're talking about it like you're actually 
trying to pretend to help them, that is not necessarily 
constructive to solving the problem, is it?
    Mr. Tudor. No, sir. I agree that we should spend 
incremental time and energy and money toward development of 
carbon capture, including allowing some other states, allowing 
us to actually inject the carbon in those states. You are one 
of the few in the country that allows that. So if a power plant 
is in Arkansas, they need to be able to inject the carbon in 
Arkansas. Otherwise, it is really expensive to build pipelines 
to get it to North Dakota.
    Senator Hoeven. Right, but you can't profess that you want 
to help them capture carbon and then pass regulations that 
prevent them from doing it, because it's unrealistic and defeat 
through delay, right? That would be kind of like talking 
through your hat, wouldn't it?
    Mr. Tudor. Yes, sir.
    Senator Hoeven. Okay, thank you very much.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    And now we have Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I really appreciate the conversation here today. This is 
probably as important as anything this Committee can possibly 
take up, is what this transition looks like because we are in 
this time of transition and it is about timing. I don't think 
it really is fair to assign a date when you are talking about a 
transition. You can have some benchmarks along the way. You can 
have some guideposts that get you there. I like Senator 
Cassidy's idea about this Committee looking to some level of 
regulatory reform, because it's through some consistency with 
regulation that you will send that signal to the markets, to 
the investors, that this is the direction that we are headed. 
And when you have got investment following, it's amazing what 
can happen in this country right now. But timing is just so 
hard. And I so get the fact that we are at this very, very, 
very awkward teenage pimply stage where we need to ramp-up and 
look toward the new future here, but we can't shed too quickly 
what we have relied on in the past.
    But the problem is, we can put in place incentives. We can 
put in place some regulatory support to build us out going 
forward. But it's really hard to find the money to keep the 
doors open for aging technology that needs to be maintained 
that nobody is interested in anymore. And yes, it's keeping the 
lights on, but it still costs money. And to the point that 
Senator Cassidy made about regulatory reform, it's not only 
hard to find the resources to keep the older stuff alive, but 
we now put in place newer regulations imposed on that that 
could make the cost of that even more extraordinary. So it's 
just a hard, hard transition that we are in.
    We really haven't talked about affordability. And that is 
such a key part of it because you can talk about reliability 
all you want, but if you can't afford it, let me tell you, 
people in my state say that is not very reliable. And we see it 
all the time. We have had great success recently in building 
out water and sanitation systems in small villages, but by the 
time we get them operational, the systems are so expensive, 
people cannot afford to hook up. When the cost of power is so 
high in communities where it's cold and dark in the wintertime, 
and you can't afford it, you turn to what you have, which is 
burning wood, and sometimes it's green wood, and you are 
dealing with particulate and emissions, and that is really 
complicating this change. If it's all about climate, we are not 
making people healthier, and it's because of the affordability 
piece of it.
    And Dr. Lott, I noticed that in your comments with response 
to just about everybody here, you say it needs to be 
reliability, but also affordability. You have focused on it, 
which I appreciate, and I do not think that we can lose sight 
of that. It's interesting to note that just a couple days ago, 
the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that 
energy insecure households were billed more for energy than 
other households. And so I look at that and I am concerned that 
as we are talking about reliability and what that means and 
what this means in terms of transition and timing, that the 
affordability piece of it is going to be the expendable piece 
because we have to keep the lights on. Well, you will be able 
to keep the lights on for those who can afford it. You will be 
able to keep the air conditioning on for those who can afford 
it, the heat on for those who can afford it. And what do we do 
about the most energy insecure?
    That is an open-ended question. You have 45 seconds, Dr. 
Lott.
    Dr. Lott. Thank you for the 45 seconds.
    Today, the conservative numbers are that one in three 
Americans is already energy insecure. They pay a huge amount of 
their income for their energy bills or they simply do not turn 
on the heater in the winter or the air conditioner in the 
summer because they know they can't afford it if they do that 
and they would risk losing their homes.
    So when we talk about this affordability question, this is 
why I tried to highlight strongly in my testimony two things. 
One, that any types of policies and regulations need to not 
just think about power plants, but all the supply technologies 
that go into them, the grid and also the demand side, to the 
point that you made around, I am in a small home, I am low 
income, it is probably less energy efficient than someone who 
is in a twice-the-size home, and so I am paying more for my 
energy bills. And so, when we think about managing demand, it 
is not just about folks who can reduce their load during a 
winter storm event, it is also about being more efficient in 
the first place and making sure that fundamentally people are 
staying safe and healthy in their homes.
    And so, the other point that I highlight in here, the 
second point, is around having a diverse set of technologies 
that have different types of characteristics. The information 
indicates that if we go to a net-zero future all the way by 
mid-century, in that scenario, we still need the same amount of 
firm, dispatchable power, capacity wise, as we have today. So 
we need those technologies to complement all the variable 
renewables, all of the grid investments we made, all the 
storage, to keep things affordable.
    Senator Murkowski. Mr. Chairman, I am out of time. This is 
not an easy issue for us, but it's certainly one that we need 
to step into.
    The Chairman. Not at all, and we will go very quickly to 
Senator King, and then we will come back to Senator Hawley.
    Senator King. Senator Hawley has not had a first round yet, 
so.
    The Chairman. You have to go. You have to go preside.
    Senator King. I have to preside. Is that all right?
    Thank you. Just a couple of quick questions.
    Mr. Asthana, we have not talked about other technologies 
like demand response, and I have an expensive thermostat in my 
house, which I can control. I have cut my energy use in my home 
here in Washington by 30 percent in the last six months by 
using this thermostat that you can turn off during the day when 
you are not there. Are there other technologies that we should 
be talking about, and are they being sufficiently developed and 
utilized?
    Mr. Asthana. Yes, I think energy efficiency, demand 
response, and then using the spare capacity that we have on the 
grid that is going to show up in the form of vehicles and 
batteries that are plugged in--not building that again--finding 
ways to reuse that when it's plugged in, I think, is going to 
be a big part of the future. And we are piloting those 
technologies. In fact, PJM has, I think, one of the premier 
demand-response programs in the world, and it's a key part of 
maintaining reliability. And I think the importance of demand 
response is only going to grow.
    Senator King. Thank you.
    I want to join my other colleagues talking about bipartisan 
permitting reform. It's something we have to do in order to 
achieve--whatever the future looks like in terms of green 
energy, it's going to require building things. And Mr. Tudor 
pointed out, for example, we are overly dependent upon China 
for lithium, which is an essential part of EV batteries. So we 
have to talk about permitting reform in a reasonable period of 
time to get things done. There were some permitting reforms in 
the budget deal that we are talking about, voting on in the 
next 24 hours, hopefully, but they didn't--there is a lot that 
was not done. For example, transmission has to be part of it.
    Mr. Robb, isn't that correct, that we really have to talk 
about being able to construct new transmission?
    Mr. Robb. No question, and it needs to be done much more 
quickly than we are able to do today.
    Senator King. And a final piece is, we have not talked too 
much about the pipeline system, but in New England, the gas 
pipeline system is part of the grid. And I believe that FERC 
should have more responsibility in terms of gas pipelines and 
reliability and cyber protection, given the integral role that 
the gas pipeline system plays in the operation of the grid at 
the current time. Do you agree?
    Mr. Robb. I agree with that, sir.
    Senator King. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, all.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Hawley.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to all of 
the witnesses for being here. I want to particularly say hello 
to and welcome Mr. Tudor, of the Springfield-based Associated 
Electric Cooperative. I say Springfield-based, that would be 
Springfield, Missouri-based, which is also my hometown. So it 
is great to have you here, and I know the rural parts of my 
state, in particular, appreciate the work that Associated has 
done. Many times, I think, rural areas are overlooked, even 
when we are talking about something as important as the grid 
system. And so, I want to thank you for the work that you do. I 
was really struck by these statistics in preparing for today's 
hearing. Associated, your cooperative, Mr. Tudor, provides 
power predominantly to older individuals. Fifty-seven percent 
are over the age of 57, 33 percent over the age of 65 and folks 
on lower incomes, which is pretty typical for rural areas in 
Missouri and for other states. And yet, you do it at some of 
the most affordable rates in the nation.
    Talk to us a little bit about your co-op model, why you 
think it works, and what we can all learn from it.
    Mr. Tudor. Thank you, sir.
    We are a little bit different. Sometimes we affectionately 
call ourselves the unicorn. We sit, you know, between RTOs. My 
predecessor chose not to join an RTO years and years ago. When 
I arrived seven years ago at Associated, we looked at joining 
MISO or SPP, and we decided not to for a lot of reasons. We 
support the market structure, you know, we do a lot of business 
with MISO and SPP. We are just different. Missouri, as you 
know, is the ``Show Me'' state, and that lends itself to a 
significant amount of independence, and so our membership, our 
customers, our member-owners, our transmission owners, our 
management team, really believe that we prefer to operate our 
own assets, including our transmission system and be 
responsible for serving our own load.
    So what is different is, in RTOs, that is all blended, 
where there are 100 utilities and they are least-cost 
dispatching, but you know, to the point of, from an 
affordability standpoint, we do have some of the lowest rates 
in the country. Our transmission rates are, you know, about a 
fourth of what the RTO transmission rates are, and it is 
because we only build transmission for load, for what our 
members need. It is a little different. I think that is going 
to change. I think we are going to have to build more 
transmission to facilitate more renewables all around us, 
otherwise we will become a linchpin for the MISO and SPP 
renewable development. And we are actually looking at that.
    Senator Hawley. Let me ask you a little bit about some of 
the challenges you face. In your testimony, you referenced how 
on the one hand we are retiring dispatchable coal generation at 
a really pretty remarkable rate. I think it's 86,000 megawatts 
retired since 2011. Another 73,000 megawatts predicted by 2040. 
In our state, in the State of Missouri, we have relied on coal 
for 74 percent of the state's power as recently as 2021. So 
talk to me a little bit about the challenge we face when we 
think about wind and solar energy--more intermittent, less 
reliable than coal, natural gas, nuclear. How do we think about 
the reliability issues and address those?
    Mr. Tudor. We believe in renewables. There have been some 
comments earlier today. We have renewables. We have about 1,240 
megawatts of wind and 500 megawatts of hydro allocation. The 
challenge is that during many of these weather events, we 
either get a lot of wind or no wind. And so, in trying to plan 
for weather events, when they come along, whether it be the 
summer or the winter, the challenge around, you know, wind and 
solar and batteries is that it's not four hours, it's typically 
days. Uri was about eight days of temperatures at zero or 
below. And Elliot was shorter, but the wind chills were more 
significant. When things got cold, we had a number of the wind 
farms that froze, but our fossil fuel plants, because they are 
already running, they have a tendency to perform better. I am 
not a coal guy. I am just about providing low-cost electricity 
to my members, and we know what works. Our fossil fuel plants 
work in today's environment.
    In the future--I agree with many things that have been said 
today--and that is if we could get to an orderly transition 
that allows us to make changes in the type of generation that 
everyone relies on, we are all for that, but that generation 
does not exist yet. There is nothing out there to replace a 
coal plant. It is not there.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you for your testimony on this. I 
have got some more questions I would love to ask you for the 
record. I appreciate what you do for my state and for 
Springfield and the whole region. Thank you for being here. 
Thanks to the witnesses for being here. And with that, Mr. 
Chairman, I will yield back.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    We are going to have a quick second round, and Senator 
Hickenlooper, if you want the second round, I will come to you, 
and if you want to stay for a second round, if you had a real 
quick question.
    Let me just say, first of all, everything we have talked 
about has been around permitting. We know where our challenges 
are, and anything to be done on a timely basis that you could 
make a determination, as you should see something coming 
online, and I think you all have talked about this, how 
desperate. We have made some inroads on permitting in the bill 
that we hopefully, for our debt ceiling, will pass tonight. I 
think we all benefit from that.
    But this Committee has an awful lot more to do--an awful 
lot more to do on permitting. And I think everyone here has 
been intricate in playing that part. In a bipartisan way, we 
can show in this Committee how we can further our permitting 
process by continuing to keep our nose to the grindstone and 
getting this done as quickly as possible.
    Just a few things. First of all, in this Committee's 
jurisdiction--electric transmission siting, cost allocation, 
interconnection queue reform, judicial review reforms for 
energy and mining projects, improve federal energy leasing for 
all types and sources, better community engagement input on 
project development, ensuring FERC and NERC have necessary 
authorities to address reliability, as we discussed today, and 
many other ideas we can consider that are priorities for 
members on both sides of this Committee, including streamlining 
hydrogen infrastructure, hydropower licensing, mining and oil 
reform, streaming LNG exports, and so much more. We are not 
saying by any means that we think that the bill that we are 
going to pass today to keep our great country paying its bills 
and keeping our credit rating strong has done everything that 
needs to be done. So I wanted all of you to know just to stay 
tuned, keep involved. We will be calling on you all to help us 
get through that, but we are going to be very vigorously 
involved in that process.
    So now we will go with our second round.
    Oh, Senator Cantwell, I am sorry. You snuck in on me.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Cantwell, for her first round of 
questioning.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you. I thank Senator Barrasso and 
you for holding this hearing and thanks for the recognition on 
this. And Mr. Chairman, you were just talking about important 
issues that I believe in too. I think FIVR is a great way to 
add affordability, help us increase the security layer, provide 
backhaul, middle-mile capacity, bring affordable, essential 
broadband to households and businesses. I was pleased to 
introduce legislation that you have been supportive of, Mr. 
Chairman, and Senator Capito has been supportive of, a bill 
that is supported by Edison Electric, National Rural Co-ops, 
and utilities.
    I wanted to ask Mr. Robb and Mr. Asthana and Dr. Lott, do 
you agree that expanding communication capacity of the grids--
existing rights-of-way--can provide significant benefits for 
reliability, resiliency, and modernization?
    Mr. Robb. I wasn't really prepared to talk to that issue, 
but I think expansion of communication accessibility for 
utilities, particularly in emergency response areas, is very 
important.
    Mr. Asthana. Yes, I would definitely support what Jim said. 
I think from a communication perspective, what we really worry 
about is communication in a crisis, right? When the grid is 
down, when we are black-starting in a cyberattack, how do we 
communicate? And I think there is a lot of opportunity there.
    Senator Cantwell. That is why I am for a closed loop--oh, I 
am sorry. Go ahead, Dr. Lott.
    Dr. Lott. I was just going to say, I agree. My first 
recommendation is making sure that we have strong communication 
networks for when incidents do occur.
    Senator Cantwell. Right. And I think people don't quite 
grasp this--I think even some people in the Administration--
that you can have a better security communication closed-loop 
network by doing this fiber, and so we are supportive of it.
    We also want to see mandatory and comprehensive standards 
on millions of miles of natural gas, oil, and hazardous liquid 
pipelines. I will be introducing legislation to ensure that 
FERC has a clear role in protecting our pipelines from 
cyberattacks. Mr. Robb and Mr. Asthana, do you believe that the 
reliability of America's pipeline system is at risk due to the 
growing number of cyberattacks? Do you believe that--FERC has 
been setting for the bulk power sectors have increased--do you 
believe that the reliability and interconnection of that with 
the pipeline system is something that we have to address?
    Mr. Robb. I can't speak for the pipeline system broadly, 
but what I can tell you, Senator, is that it is absolutely 
clear to me that the reliability and security of the natural 
gas pipeline system is heavily linked to our ability to serve 
customers through the electric grid. So those systems are 
absolutely interlinked. The second point I would make is that 
the FERC-approved CIP standards that we have developed as NERC 
for the electric sector have done their job in terms of 
protecting the grid from cyberattacks. And then, we would be 
well served to expand those to address the pipeline system. And 
the third point I would make is that the one common denominator 
event in every cold weather event we have studied over the last 
15 years has been fuel supply related to natural gas being 
available for power generators. It is a complex problem. It is 
not as simple as it sounds, but it needs to be addressed.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Ms. Asthana. Senator, I serve on the NIAC, and so we do 
study the linkages between the critical sectors. And I think 
this linkage between gas and power is critical, particularly in 
a cyberattack scenario, but also in a natural disaster or 
extreme weather scenario.
    Senator Cantwell. Great. Thank you, I appreciate that 
answer and what we need to do to shape it up.
    Mr. Robb, during last year's heat wave in California, 
Pacific Northwest Hydro provided seven to eight gigawatts of 
energy so its neighbors could keep the lights on. How important 
is it to ensure that clean, reliable power can be dispatched 
when the grid gets distressed?
    Senator Daines and I have introduced legislation, along 
with Senators Wyden and Risch, that would streamline and 
expedite hydropower relicensing to ensure the resources stay 
online. Do you think this idea is a good--what we are talking 
about here--a good proposal--the Daines-Cantwell Hydro 
Relicensing?
    Mr. Robb. Without knowing the details of the bill, what I 
will say is that hydropower is an outstanding resource. It's 
clean, it's dispatchable, and it plays a huge role in the 
Western Interconnection, as you probably know. So I think 
anything that can expand and secure that resource for the 
future is highly valuable.
    Senator Cantwell. Anybody else?
    I see some nodding.
    Mr. Asthana. The only thing I would build on Jim's answer 
is, in addition to run-of-river hydro, we actually have some 
significant pumped hydro storage, essentially batteries on our 
system, and I think those are incredibly valuable and we would 
love to see more.
    Senator Cantwell. Yes, thank you for mentioning pumped 
storage. Thank you.
    Mr. Tudor. I agree.
    Senator Cantwell. Okay, great.
    Dr. Lott. So briefly, we often talk about coal and natural 
gas as sources of firm power and also backup when demand 
spikes, but hydro, nuclear, geothermal, these are also 
tremendous resources to provide that power.
    Senator Cantwell. Great.
    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    I would just like to follow up on some of the things that 
Senator Hawley has been talking about to Mr. Tudor. And you 
know, because you are the only witness here today who runs an 
organization that actually produces electricity. A couple of 
weeks ago, you went to Wyoming, our rural electric association, 
where their mission--assigned mission since 1938--is to provide 
safe, affordable, reliable electricity to their users. It is 
almost becoming mission impossible with some of the threats 
that they are facing. So you stated that investors and insurers 
around the country, both in the United States and abroad, are 
putting pressure on electricity producers and doing it to 
retire coal and natural gas-fired plants prematurely. These 
institutions pressure cooperatives, investor-owned utilities, 
and others to replace the plants with weather-dependent wind 
and solar units.
    So to what extent have government policies added to the 
pressure that you are facing from financial institutions?
    Mr. Tudor. It has created a significant fear factor, first 
of all. These--and it is, really, kind of this continual battle 
to try and maintain and protect our assets. The banks basically 
have told us over the last several years that they will stop 
providing us lending on coal repairs, coal assets, if we have 
25 percent of our revenue coming from, in our portfolio, from 
coal. The insurance underwriters, both in the U.S. and Europe, 
are also telling us the same thing, that they are not going to 
insure our assets, not all of them, but many of them, again, if 
we have 25 percent of our revenue coming from a coal asset.
    So that has narrowed the number of people we can borrow 
money from and the number of people that will insure our 
assets, which makes it more expensive. Anything more expensive 
is bad for our consumer-owners, who are largely rural, low-
income customers.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, that was it in terms of how this 
effects the families that Senator Hawley was talking about, the 
families, the businesses who need the electricity.
    Additionally, the Department of Energy is currently 
revising the efficiency standard for distribution transformers. 
The proposed standard, as I understand it, would increase the 
efficiency by only one tenth of one percentage point. I mean, 
that is negligible improvement. But yet, to meet the standards, 
that is going to require fundamental changes in the 
manufacturing process for these transformers. So you are going 
to be hit with all of this. This could jeopardize the 
availability of components needed to supply the electricity to 
homes and to businesses across the country. So worse yet, this 
proposal comes in the middle of an ongoing shortage of these 
transformers.
    In your testimony, you said that the proposed standard ``is 
already hindering efforts to increase the number of 
transformers available.'' So if the Biden Administration 
proposal becomes a final rule, what impact do you expect that 
to have?
    Mr. Tudor. I mean, this is significant. It is a horrible 
idea. Let me just state that. And it doesn't move the needle, 
and there are so many other things that we have talked about 
today that are so much more important. And today, we can't get 
large transformers. It is a three- to four-year time frame to 
get a transformer. And everything we have talked about today, 
in terms of infrastructure, transmission, operations, 
generation, all this stuff requires electricity wire, conduit, 
poles, transformers. So all this is going to do is slow down 
that whole process.
    And then the real question is, we have stuff to fix now. We 
have a business to run and we have to repair and keep this, 
basically, this equipment up to date. So we have hundreds of 
millions of dollars that need to be spent just to keep our 
existing system up to speed. And then, when we start talking 
about adding all these new projects, renewables, that is even 
more infrastructure needs.
    Senator Barrasso. And when you run through this whole list 
of the things that you would need--does any of it come from 
China?
    Mr. Tudor. Yes, sir.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Barrasso. No further questions.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Don't need no further questions.
    Senator Hickenlooper.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. And again, thank you all for 
this.
    Mr. Robb, in the debt ceiling negotiations that the Chair 
referred to, there was a strong interest in interregional 
transmission and its role promoting reliability and resilience. 
Can you speak to the role that interregional transmission plays 
in promoting reliability within the grid?
    Mr. Robb. It seems to be a very popular question I am 
receiving these days.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Exactly.
    Mr. Robb. Interregional transmission is a terrific way to 
build resilience and reliability into the grid. It diversifies 
your resource base. I think David talked about the benefits 
that Associated has by having straws into a number of different 
markets and resource bases. So I think there is a tremendous 
amount of value to getting our head around the state of the 
transmission system and our ability to build resilience into 
the grid through expanded transmission. Whether it's 
interregional transmission for reliability purposes or longer-
scale projects to unlock renewables and get them to load, I 
think it's a very right-minded thing for us to be very 
aggressive in looking at. With all the provisos that David 
said, the supply chain to get these projects built also needs 
to be solved in parallel.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Got it.
    And also, as you are aware, FERC's got an open docket on 
minimum transfer capabilities, including workshops and public 
comments. Is NERC--are you following part of that docket, and 
given both Congress's and FERC's demonstrated interest in 
minimum transfer capabilities, would you be able to prioritize 
getting the study completed more rapidly than in the allotted 
time, let's say maybe in six months or eight months?
    Mr. Robb. So to be fair, we were surprised by the provision 
in the bill.
    Senator Hickenlooper. You and me both.
    Mr. Robb. We were enthused about it, but surprised about 
it. I think it is a right-minded thing for us to do, but I 
can't commit right now that I have my head fully around what it 
is going to take to do that project correctly. But I think it 
needs to be done.
    Senator Hickenlooper. I think there is a--as we have heard 
today at every corner, there should be a sense of urgency.
    Mr. Robb. Yes.
    Senator Hickenlooper. I yield back to the Chair.
    The Chairman. Senator Hawley.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Tudor, if I could just come back to you and pick up 
Senator Barrasso's line of questioning. He was talking to you 
about components in China. You said, ``yes.'' Elaborate. What 
comes from China?
    Mr. Tudor. Well, when you start talking about batteries, 
many of the minerals come from China. You talk about solar 
panels, as you know, there has been an embargo against solar 
panels coming from China. A number of the solar panel companies 
are in China. So when you start bringing renewables into the 
mix and all these projects, part of what, you know, what Manu 
is talking about is, is that all these projects are sitting 
there in the queue, but not all of them have panels. What they 
have done is, they may have the land, they may have bought a 
transformer, you know, they have to do certain things to 
actually--they may have put a deposit down. But just because 
they put a deposit down on ten different sites in PJM doesn't 
mean they are ever going to build that solar. And part of the 
challenge is, where are you going to get the equipment, and a 
lot of that equipment comes from overseas, and most of it from 
China.
    Senator Hawley. Is it a good idea, in general, for us to be 
more dependent for critical energy components on China, in your 
view?
    Mr. Tudor. I don't think it's a good idea.
    Senator Hawley. I wouldn't think so either.
    Let me ask you just briefly about another Biden 
Administration rule. This is an EPA rule that would limit 
carbon dioxide emissions from coal and gas power plants that 
they issued just last month. You mentioned this in your 
testimony. You said, and I am going to quote you: ``The EPA has 
indicated that their goal is to encourage . . . '' --
encourage-- `` . . . the closure of coal and natural gas 
units.'' Let me just ask you, what do you expect the effect of 
those mandates will be for prices in Missouri, for example?
    Mr. Tudor. Well, there will be significant litigation 
against the 111(b) and (d) rules. Right now it is just a 
proposal. There is a 60-day time frame for all of us to make 
comments. I think that, first of all, is unfair for the RTOs 
and companies like ours, our southern company. For us to 
actually try and look at the effects of that in a 60-day window 
is, frankly, unfair.
    And then, whenever they come out with the rule, that is 
when we have to file litigation. I think you will see 
significant litigation against that rule. That is money and 
time, and that cost--so, if you have a strategy to run someone 
out of business by basically taking away their financing and 
their ability to insure and you increase their cost, that is a 
quick--and then you incent other resources. We are not pointing 
at anybody. If you incent other resources, what you do is you 
create this scenario where this is--it is picking sides. It is 
picking winners and losers. And I do not think we should be 
picking winners and losers. That is just my personal opinion.
    Senator Hawley. Well, you know, you are the expert in this 
field, not me. I would just say that it seems to me that we 
wouldn't want to be closing down our own energy resources in 
this country, raising prices for our consumers, while 
simultaneously making ourselves dependent on China, in 
particular, where America gets poorer, China gets richer. That 
seems like a bad deal to me, whether we are talking about 
energy or anything else. So I kind of think we are going in the 
wrong direction here. And I think that your testimony points 
that out and highlights it. So thank you for--yes, go ahead.
    Mr. Tudor. One last point is that I don't know how you can 
do this, but any way that you can actually slow the EPA down, 
and they are supposed to have these joint discussions going on 
with the DOE. Anything we can do to get them understanding the 
significant risk they are putting our country at by forcing 
something that works to go away before you have something to 
replace it with. We have to slow them down.
    That does not mean that I am against--I mean, I believe in 
climate change. I think the climate is changing. I just think 
reliability is more important. Sorry.
    Senator Hawley. Hey, I am with you. And also, let's talk 
about the people who you serve, who pay the bills. You know, 
are we going to ask low-income folks, working people in my 
state to foot the bills for this Administration's climate 
agenda that benefits China? No thanks.
    All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Let me, again, thank all of you. It was tremendous. It was, 
I think, very interesting. You can tell by the questions and 
attention that you were able to capture and hold.
    One thing I will say is that transmission is going to be a 
challenging thing for us. We have some states that do not want 
to be involved because they have a pretty good monopoly. And we 
understand that. And we want to make sure that they are 
protected, but also, be part of this as we have to be able to, 
you know, move these electrons. So we are going to ask for your 
input and thoughts. Anything you want to submit to the 
Committee on how you think we can navigate the transmission by 
not encroaching and basically changing someone's whole business 
model. That is not our intention.
    And I want to make sure that these states that have these 
tremendous delivery systems, I think you all know which ones I 
am talking about, but these are all our friends. We want to 
make sure they have the opportunity to do what needs to be done 
for us to move the electrons that need to be moved. We are 
going to need your input to make that happen because right now 
it will be challenging, but without transmission, we are not 
going to be able to move, whether it's fossil or whether it's 
renewables. We can't move it. We know that, and we are not 
going to meet any deadlines whatsoever.
    And I think if you--the most interesting meeting I had in 
my office--about a month ago, I came in and there was a group 
of military people from Germany. They said, we came to explain 
to you, if you want to know what not to do with your energy 
grid, look at what we did. We did the wrong thing. We took 
things offline before we had anything to replace it and became 
totally dependent on Russian energy--oil, and gas--cheap. It's 
like a dope dealer. They get addicted to it. And basically, 
they are paying a heck of a price right now and we are doing 
everything we can to give them the support, but we have to be 
energy secure. That is the most important thing.
    And I think that with the debt ceiling today, I am very 
appreciative. Democracy is working well. You have Democrats and 
Republicans both joining forces, which we will do hopefully 
sometime today, tonight, whenever. But you know, I believe in 
this great country and the process we have, even though it gets 
quite challenging at times. Don't give up, okay? But we need 
your input.
    So with that, members will have until the close of business 
tomorrow to submit additional questions for the record.
    With that, the meeting is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:11 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
