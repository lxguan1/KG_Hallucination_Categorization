                     WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024

              House of Representatives,    
               Committee on Small Business,
                        Subcommittee on Innovation,
               Entrepreneurship, and Workforce Development,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:03 a.m., in 
Room 2360, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Marcus J. 
Molinaro [chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives Molinaro, Williams, Mann, 
McGarvey, Thanedar, and Chu.
    Chairman MOLINARO. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for 
joining the Subcommittee on Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and 
Workforce Development.
    Before we get started, I would like to recognize the 
Ranking Member, Representative Mc Garvey, to lead us in the 
pledge and a prayer.
    Mr. MCGARVEY. We thank you for the opportunity to be here 
today and to be together. We ask for your wisdom. We ask for 
your grace. We ask for your patience in these matters. We ask 
that you bless all of us to make decisions in the testimony the 
best we can.
    In your name we pray. Amen.
    All. I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States 
of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one 
nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for 
all.
    Chairman MOLINARO. Thank you, sir.
    I now call the Committee on Small Business to order.
    Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a 
recess of the Committee at any time.
    I would now like to recognize myself for an opening 
statement and appreciate you all for being here. And I welcome 
those of you on our panel to the Subcommittee.
    First, to each of our witnesses, thank you. We recognize 
your time is valuable and hope you know we appreciate you 
spending time with us and look forward to your testimonies.
    The current labor shortage in the United States is 
disproportionately affecting small businesses, with 40 percent 
of small employers unable to fill job openings as of August. 
This crisis is exacerbated by economic pressures from the 
Biden-Harris Administration, with many businesses struggling to 
find qualified talent amid rising costs and inflation. The 
construction, healthcare, and automotive sectors are 
particularly in need, facing significant deficits in skilled 
labor that could hinder growth and increase project delays.
    These on-the-ground issues small businesses face are 
exacerbated in rural and underserved communities like the ones 
I represent in upstate New York. The labor shortage is not 
confined to small employers, as we likely know. The broader 
labor market is facing one of the most challenging years in 
recent history. Contributing factors include an aging 
workforce, with projections indicating that 41 percent of 
workers nearing retirement by 2031 will lead to a substantial 
loss of institutional knowledge.
    Additionally, younger individuals are entering the 
workforce at a lower-than-expected rate. Many workers laid off 
during the pandemic and economic shutdown are unwilling to 
return to jobs--jobs lacking remote work options, reflecting a 
shift in employment--in employee expectations.
    And despite these challenges, I would note that people with 
disabilities still represent an untapped workforce. This 
Subcommittee has spent some time focused, in fact, on this 
population. Their participation in the labor market has surged 
since the pandemic, with 1.8 million joining, bringing their 
employment rate up to 25 percent, the highest in 15 years. 
Organizations like Community Options, Inc., represented here 
today, are crucial in providing training and job placement, 
partnering with major companies to support individuals with 
disabilities. Hiring these workers not only promotes 
inclusivity but also boosts workplace morale and results in 
lower turnover and absentee rates.
    For me, that is why I introduced the Think DIFFERENTLY 
Initiative and Think DIFFERENTLY About Disability Employment 
Act, to help small businesses address accessibility issues for 
employees with disabilities, encouraging the hiring of those 
with intellectual, physical, and developmental disabilities, 
and help entrepreneurs with disabilities succeed.
    We were proud to see this piece of legislation pass the 
House. And I was also proud to co-lead the Entrepreneurs with 
Disabilities Reporting Act, alongside Ranking Member Mc Garvey, 
to better understand the challenges entrepreneurs with 
disabilities face.
    Addressing the skills gap through workforce development is 
essential. Traditional education paths may not suit everyone, 
and we know this. And skilled trades offer viable alternatives. 
Combatting the ongoing labor shortage by supporting our skilled 
trade schools and apprenticeship programs is a bipartisan 
effort.
    And I worked alongside my colleagues and fellow Small 
Business Committee Member, in this case Representative 
Scholten, to introduce the Honoring Vocational Education Act, 
which ensures individuals who attend job training programs, 
trade schools, union apprenticeships, and other like programs 
are recognized as obtaining a post-secondary nondegree award.
    Additionally, I was proud to co-lead the Small Business 
Workforce Pipeline Act to help small businesses offer more 
apprenticeships and on-the-job training opportunities.
    In order to alleviate the labor shortage and support small 
businesses, it is vital to harness the potential of people with 
disabilities and to also promote skilled trades. By focusing on 
these areas, there is potential for significant improvement in 
the labor market, ultimately benefiting both small businesses 
and the broader economy.
    First, want to thank our witnesses again for joining us 
today. I look forward to the conversation ahead.
    And with that, I yield to our distinguished Ranking Member 
from Kentucky, Mr. McGarvey.
    Mr. MCGARVEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for 
bringing us together today to discuss how we can tackle one of 
the most persistent challenges that faces small businesses and 
our economy. That is the workforce shortage.
    Everywhere I go--I bet it is the same in your district 
too--everywhere I go, we are hearing the same thing: Small 
business owners are struggling to find and keep qualified 
workers. It is not just anecdotal, though. There are survey 
upon survey upon survey confirming that finding workers is the 
top operational challenge facing small businesses. More than 
inflation, more than supply chains, more than regulations.
    This isn't new. Even before the pandemic, there were 
workforce shortages, particularly in the skilled trades. Part 
of the problem is the longstanding misconception that the only 
path to the middle class is through a 4-year college degree. 
Unfortunately, we know that college, while right for some, is 
not right for everyone. But our focus on college has led to a 
chronic underfunding of career and vocational training programs 
that would help fill those jobs in the highest demand today.
    Thankfully, over the past few years, we are doing better, 
and we are seeing real investment in workforce training and 
apprenticeships and a surge in interest by young people. For 
instance, apprenticeships have more than doubled over the past 
decade, helping younger people earn while they learn and enter 
high-paying jobs without shouldering the cost and the debt of a 
college degree.
    In Kentucky alone we have seen a 144 percent increase in 
apprenticeship enrollment in the last decade. That number 
continues to grow. Programs at the high school level, such as 
career and technical education programs, are gaining popularity 
as well. And they help students develop skills that can guide 
them into apprenticeships on traditional education pathways.
    Because of their newfound popularity, the biggest problem 
with these programs is now finding available instructors rather 
than convincing students to enroll.
    It is time for Congress to invest in career and technical 
education so that we can reap the full benefits of our 
investments, and transformative legislation, like the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the 
Inflation Reduction Act. These laws create millions of jobs, 
but those jobs require specific skill sets, and we must ensure 
that we are providing the training needed to fill them.
    Apprenticeship programs too are not only essential for 
training workers but offer avenues to entrepreneurship. For 
apprentices interested in starting their own businesses, union 
trainers can help them access courses that introduce them to 
the management side of the industry.
    While I am optimistic about the progress we have made, we 
know there is still a long way to go. Other industrialized 
nations are investing far more in workforce development than we 
are. The U.S. currently invests less than $20 billion across 43 
federal employment and training programs, less than .01 percent 
of our GDP, while our peers are putting up five times that 
amount.
    Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act programs, the 
backbone of the federal government's workforce development 
efforts, are both underutilized and underfunded, and since 
2019, unauthorized. Earlier this year, the House overwhelmingly 
passed the bipartisan reauthorization of the Workforce 
Innovation and Opportunity Act, and we hope to see the Senate 
follow suit soon.
    Any of you who are sports fans will understand what I mean 
when I say that our workforce development system, like the 
University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville 
basketball teams, is in a rebuilding phase. But with the right 
investments and approach, we can build something stronger that 
meets the needs of our economy, supports small businesses, and 
gives every American the chance and opportunity to get ahead. 
Building the workforce of tomorrow begins with our investments 
today.
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses, and I yield 
back.
    Chairman MOLINARO. Thank you, Mr. McGarvey.
    For the record, as a New York Mets fan, we are always in 
the rebuilding phase. This may, however, be our year.
    Somebody who knows a little bit about sports as well, let 
me recognize the distinguished gentleman from Texas, the 
Chairman of the full Committee, Mr. Williams.
    Mr. WILLIAMS. Well, thank you. And I don't know if this is 
the year for the Mets. Don't get too--they are close right now.
    Chairman MOLINARO. It is never the year for the Mets.
    Mr. WILLIAMS. Good morning. And I want to thank my good 
friend, Chairman Molinaro, for holding today's Subcommittee 
hearing to discuss our nation's current labor shortage and 
workforce development issues.
    To start off, I would like to thank our witnesses for being 
here. Thank you very much. We appreciate you taking the time to 
come out and contribute to a very important discussion today.
    And to put this simply, main street is facing a dire labor 
shortage, with 90 percent of businesses reporting few or no 
qualified applicants in August. Industries like construction 
are particularly affected, with the projection showing the need 
for over 500,000 additional workers annually. This is why it is 
more important than ever that we promote skilled trades to grow 
our economy and combat the workforce shortage. These jobs are 
not only in demand but also allow people to learn a valued 
skill without needing to take on tens of thousands of dollars 
in student loan debt in order to get the proper training.
    So additionally, there is another segment of our population 
that has been overlooked as we look to have more people enter 
the workforce, and people with disabilities are very 
entrepreneurial and can add value to many businesses. We have 
already heard about the first hearing we held with Congress 
where we had a 16-year-old, Drew Davis, come before us, talk 
about his story of creating his own hot sauce company. He has 
cerebral palsy, but he did not let it hold him back as he 
pursued his dream. His story was inspiring, and it showed that 
with a little help, anyone can be an entrepreneur in America.
    So I want to again thank Chairman Molinaro for--and the 
Ranking Member for bringing the Committee to--attention to 
these workforce issues that are affecting main street 
businesses, and I look forward to today's conversations.
    And I yield back.
    Chairman MOLINARO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Let me now introduce our witnesses.
    First, with us here today is Ms. Ashley Gamba. Ms. Gamba is 
the executive director of Community Options, Inc., located in 
Binghamton, New York. Founded in 1989, Community Options is a 
nationwide nonprofit organization that develops housing and 
employment opportunities for people with intellectual, 
physical, and developmental disabilities. Since its founding, 
Community Options has expanded their services to over 10 
States, partnering with local governments to provide employment 
opportunities across the country.
    Throughout my time in public service, I can tell you that 
Community Options has been a leader and a voice for our 
disability community, especially throughout Broome County in 
New York State.
    One of the organization's most memorable events is the 
annual Cupid's Chase in Binghamton, which brings together our 
community in support for those with disabilities. From hosting 
job training events to building out their new pharmacy 
technician workforce program to creating an internship program 
with Legends at Yankee Stadium, Community Options empowers 
those with disabilities to meaningfully contribute to main 
street and lead more independent lives.
    Ms. Gamba has been with Community Options, Inc., since 
2017, when she began as the State Director of Employment 
Services before moving to her current position last year as 
Executive Director. Ms. Gamba attended the University of 
Buffalo, where she earned her Master's of Science in Vocational 
Rehabilitation counseling.
    And I am certainly grateful to you for joining us here 
today for today's discussion.
    Our next witness is Mr. Frank Stento. Mr. Stento is the 
Director of Business Development in District Council Number 4 
Painters & Allied Trades, located in Binghamton, New York. 
District Council 4 represents 2,000 active and retired men and 
women in 33 counties throughout western and central New York. 
Representing those in the finishing trades, District 4 has been 
a leader in providing high-quality, work-based training 
programs for those seeking a career in the trades.
    Mr. Stento has been involved with District 4 since 2018, 
where he began as Business Development Specialist. In addition 
to his position as Director of Business Development, Mr. Stento 
serves as the President of District Council 4 Local 178 and is 
Vice President of the Binghamton-Oneonta Building Trades.
    Mr. Stento earned his Associate's of Arts and Science in 
workforce development and training from Mountwest Community & 
Technical College. I'm a big fan of community colleges.
    Thank you, sir, for joining us today for this conversation.
    And now let me recognize Ranking Member McGarvey to 
introduce our last witness appearing before us today.
    Mr. MCGARVEY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Our final witness today is Mr. Neal Strange. He is director 
of education at the Indiana Kentucky Ohio Regional Council of 
Carpenters. Three States, but one gets a little more emphasis 
there from us. And he is part of the Joint Apprenticeship & 
Training Fund.
    Mr. Strange is a 15-year Member of the United Brotherhood 
of Carpenters and Joiners of America, and currently serves as 
director of education, overseeing the operations of nine 
training centers across Indiana and Kentucky. These centers 
support over 4,000 apprentices as well as the continuing 
education program.
    Mr. Strange is himself a graduate of UBC's 4-year 
apprenticeship program and holds an associate of applied 
science in construction technologies and a journeyman carpenter 
designation.
    After working in the field, he transitioned to a career in 
education, becoming a full-time instructor in 2022.
    Thank you, Mr. Strange, for joining us today.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Chairman MOLINARO. Thank you, Mr. McGarvey.
    We appreciate you all being here today with us.
    I do want to extend our appreciation to the staff of the 
Small Business Committee and, of course, our two offices for 
coordinating today's hearing.
    And before recognizing the witnesses, let me also remind 
each of you that your testimony today is restricted to 5 
minutes. If you see the light turn red in front of you, it 
means your time is up. And Mr. McGarvey gets very, very 
anxious. And to the extent you can, please just wrap up your 
testimony at that point.
    And with that, let me recognize Ms. Gamba for your opening 
remarks. Thank you.

 STATEMENTS OF MS. ASHLEY GAMBA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COMMUNITY 
     OPTIONS, INC.; MR. FRANK STENTO, DIRECTOR OF BUSINESS 
DEVELOPMENT, PAINTERS AND ALLIED TRADES UNION DISTRICT COUNCIL 
   #4; AND MR. NEAL STRANGE, DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION, INDIANA 
      KENTUCKY OHIO REGIONAL COUNCIL OF CARPENTERS JOINT 
                APPRENTICESHIP AND TRAINING FUND

                 STATEMENT OF MS. ASHLEY GAMBA

    Ms. GAMBA. Dear Chairman Williams, Ranking Member McGarvey, 
Members of the U.S. House Committee on Small Business, as the 
executive director for Community Options New York, I am pleased 
to have the opportunity to provide written testimony, or verbal 
testimony, to the U.S. House Committee on Small Business 
regarding workforce training programs that are available to 
help small business owners expand their labor pool.
    Over the past year, we have supported over 5,000 people 
with disabilities, including 2,100 people receiving employment 
services, assisting them with developing the skills needed to 
obtain and maintain meaningful, competitive, integrated 
employment.
    Community Options has had the opportunity to develop 
innovative training programs in partnership with numerous 
businesses to assist with positive employment outcomes for 
people with disabilities across New York State. We have 
partnered with Legends at Yankee Stadium to provide hands-on 
integrated training in the following areas: merchandising, food 
service, customer service, and retail. By providing work 
readiness training to assist participants with building the 
soft skills related to employment, hands-on experience to 
develop transferable work skills, and on-site training and 
support, we have successfully placed over 200 individuals in 
paid work experiences that have resulted in 80 percent of 
placement in competitive employment settings.
    Additionally, through partnership with the NBA Foundation, 
Community Options has received funding to provide training and 
employment supports to minority youth with disabilities across 
several States. This funding has enabled us to identify youth 
with disabilities and provide work readiness training, career 
exploration counseling, job placement, and job coaching 
services. This couldn't be done without our small business 
partners, local businesses and organizations that have assisted 
with allowing us the opportunity to provide on-site training 
and job coaching supports to the individuals that we work with.
    Most recently, we have had the opportunity to partner with 
CVS Health to provide retail, front and back store, supervisor 
training, and a Department of Labor-funded pre-apprenticeship 
training program for pharm technicians, or pharmacy 
technicians. Through this partnership we have had the 
opportunity to build a career readiness center offering hands-
on training to further develop the transferable work skills 
required for competitive employment.
    In our ever-evolving economy, it has become apparent that 
hiring to meet the needs of many small businesses has proven to 
be difficult. In a recent survey conducted by SCORE, more than 
50 percent of small businesses reported that it was very or 
somewhat difficult to fill open positions, citing it has been 
most problematic to find skilled or qualified workers.
    Additionally, according to the Society for Human Resources 
Management, approximately 97 percent of HR professionals and 92 
percent of people managers say that employees with disabilities 
often perform at the same or better level than their coworkers 
without disabilities, yet this population often faces 
significant challenges when attempting to obtain meaningful 
employment.
    As always, we are very thankful for our small business 
partners who work closely with our agency to provide employment 
opportunities for people with disabilities. We encourage small 
businesses across the country to partner with local agencies to 
increase the availability and accessibility to training 
programs designed to train and develop the skills of this 
underrepresented population.
    And we also urge Congress to continue to strengthen funding 
for the vocational and pre-apprenticeship opportunities for 
both youth and adults with disabilities.
    Chairman MOLINARO. Thank you, Ashley. Appreciate that very 
much.
    I now recognize Mr. Stento for your 5-minute opening 
remarks.

                 STATEMENT OF MR. FRANK STENTO

    Mr. STENTO. Thank you.
    Good morning, Chairman Williams, Chairman Molinaro, and 
esteemed Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the invite 
to give testimony today on my experience with registered 
apprenticeship programs and the--and how they can impact 
positively workforce development moving forward.
    So I have got a great--I have a great deal of gratitude for 
my organization, the International Union of Painters and Allied 
Trades; for the small business owners, also known as the 
subcontractors, who employed me out in the field; for my 
instructors and journey workers that supported and trained me 
to become a skilled craftsman; and then to my mentors that 
challenged me and took the time to help me develop.
    What do those all have in common? The workforce model of a 
registered apprenticeship program, which has a rich history in 
the United States and has a bright future to come.
    Like many others before me, this system provided me an 
opportunity, a purpose, and the tools to achieve success. 
Apprenticeship in the skilled trades offers a unique 
opportunity to gain hands-on experience while earning a living.
    Unlike traditional classroom education, as Ranking Member 
McGarvey said, an earn-while-you-learn apprenticeship allows 
you to gain knowledge by working under the guidance of 
experienced professionals in the industry. Practical training 
ensures that you develop the technical skills necessary to 
excel in your chosen field, whether it is plumbing, electrical, 
carpentry, or like myself, in the finishing trades. This leads 
to full-time employment, providing a clear path to a stable 
career without the burden of student loan debt.
    The other 4-year degree is what we commonly reference a 
registered apprenticeship program. Although the timeframe 
depending on a craft and curriculum can be anywhere from 3 to 5 
years.
    Beyond the technical skills, apprenticeships also foster 
personal development. They teach you how to work in real-world 
environments, solve problems on the spot, and communicate 
effectively on job sites and beyond. These skills are 
invaluable across many areas of life and make apprentices 
highly sought after by employers.
    Furthermore, the demand for skilled tradespeople continues 
to grow, offering long-term job security and competitive wages. 
With the abundance of mega products on the horizon, combined 
with a workforce that is aging, there is an urgency to get new 
candidates in the pipeline to sustain the industry for those 
small business owners long term.
    Apprenticeship not only builds expertise but sets the 
foundation for a rewarding and sustainable career. In 
apprenticeship school, our instructors teach hands-on 
applications and best practices. A large component is dedicated 
to health and safety to minimize accidents in the field. There 
is conversations around tools, equipment, and technologies in 
the craft. Training around financial literacy, social skills, 
the history of the trade, and advances in the industry are also 
incorporated. We complete mockups in-house for repetition in 
the craft and perform projects for nonprofits in the community.
    After apprenticeship school, there is a huge focus on 
journey worker upgrading, as we have an obligation to maintain 
our reputation as the most highly skilled, safe, and productive 
workforce performing our crafts.
    We have--pardon me. We have an online learning management 
system with hundreds of courses to choose from, including 
blueprint reading, estimating essentials, and project 
management. This helps with the retention of our workforce, and 
the constant training makes those involved more employable.
    The way we have our apprenticeship set up, it is called 
block training, which is 4 full weeks a year during the months 
of January through April. The rest of the apprenticeship is 
made up of on-the-job training with our contracted partners and 
our skilled journey workers.
    A high-paying and sustainable career with benefits in the 
construction field is the ultimate purpose of a registered 
apprenticeship program. With continuing education and training 
opportunities, additional pathways can be accessed in the 
industry.
    Some of the best and brightest foremen, superintendents, 
project managers, contractors--and the list goes on--came 
through an apprenticeship program with--and had field 
experience.
    I completed my apprenticeship in 2016. I received 40 
college credits through an articulation agreement with 
Mountwest Community & Technical College, which I am grateful 
for. I then finished my associate's degree. I was running 
projects in the field and started instructing part time through 
our district council, which then eventually led to a full-time 
staff position in business development, also known as 
organizing.
    Now one of the best parts of my career is seeing others 
come in and find similar success and watching their 
trajectories and life change. An apprenticeship program is a 
great way to start a career, as well as a necessary system to 
continue the pipeline of skilled journey workers to business 
owners.
    Any opportunities that we have to increase apprenticeships 
will greatly assist the challenges surrounding supply and 
demand that dominate recent conversation in the industry, while 
simultaneously raising up those middle-class workers.
    I thank you for your time, and look forward to your 
questions.
    Chairman MOLINARO. Thanks, Frank.
    Mr. Strange, for your opening remarks.

                 STATEMENT OF MR. NEAL STRANGE

    Mr. STRANGE. Yes. So good morning, Chairman Molinaro, 
Ranking Member McGarvey, and Members of the Committee. Thank 
you for the opportunity to speak with you today.
    My name is Neal Strange, as addressed earlier by Mr. 
McGarvey. I am the director of education for the Indiana 
Kentucky Ohio Regional Council of Carpenters Joint 
Apprenticeship and Training Fund, also a 15-year Member of the 
UBC, and a graduate of the program myself.
    I am here to provide an overview of our apprenticeship 
program and the continuing education we offer to our Members. 
This program is not just about learning a trade. It is about 
ensuring our Members are equipped with the skills and knowledge 
needed to thrive in an ever-changing industry. Our council 
consists of 38,000 Members within Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio, 
and over 550,000 Members across the United States and Canada. 
We represent the carpenters, millwrights, piledrivers, and 
floor layers who are building our country's bridges, highways, 
manufacturing sites, hospitals, schools, and power production 
facilities.
    At the core of our training philosophy is the belief that 
our contractors must remain relevant and prepared for both 
existing and emerging construction markets. To achieve this, we 
partner closely with contractors, manufacturers, and local 
universities to meet their specific needs. Together, we provide 
a robust training curriculum that emphasizes both productivity 
and safety, ensuring that our Members deliver high-quality 
product on every site.
    One of the greatest strengths of our program is that all 
training is provided at no cost to the individual Members. 
Funding for our programs comes from contributions made for 
every hour worked on a job site by our signatory contractors. 
Nevertheless, we lift the financial burden off of those 
contractors, allowing them to focus on project execution 
without worrying about additional expenses related to training 
workers and ensuring their workforce has the proper 
certifications necessary for specific jobs. Our members benefit 
from a top-tier education while our contractors benefit from a 
highly skilled workforce.
    In terms of compensation, our apprentices are paid on a 
scaled wage basis. The wage structure provides apprentices with 
fair compensation as they build their skills, which further 
incentivizes retention and productivity. This model also allows 
our contractors to remain competitive in the market while 
employing highly trained and motivated workers.
    We offer multiple pathways into our program, creating 
accessibility for our diverse group of candidates. We have 
partnerships with high school career and technical education 
programs, adult education initiatives, State and county reentry 
programs, and military veteran organizations, such as Helmets 
to Hardhats and our own internal military veterans program. 
These pathways ensure that we are tapping into a wide range of 
talent allowing for diversity and inclusion in our workforce.
    In the past 4 years, our apprenticeship enrollment has 
grown by 40 percent, reflecting both the demand for skilled 
labor and also the increasing awareness of the opportunities 
our program offers for career growth and development. Current 
enrollment across our three States totals more than 6,900 
apprentices. This includes 22 percent minority enrollment and 6 
percent female enrollment.
    From the moment an apprentice begins our program, safety 
becomes an integral part of their education. Beginning with an 
OSHA 10 certification and continuing throughout their 
apprenticeship, safety protocols are embedded into every aspect 
of training. A safe worker is an effective worker, and this 
foundation is key to the longevity of their career and the 
protection of our job sites.
    For Members who aspire to further advance their careers 
beyond the apprenticeship, we offer additional pathways into 
leadership roles, project management, and business ownership. 
Whether a Member seeks to move into superintendent or 
management positions or has an entrepreneurial spirit and 
wishes to start their own contracting business, our continuing 
education resources equip them with the skills and confidence 
to succeed.
    We recognize the importance of nurturing leadership from 
within, and our specialized programs allow our Members to 
thrive in roles that require strategic thinking and operational 
oversight.
    Our program's reach extends well beyond training the 
individual. We play a crucial role in economic development by 
placing our skilled workers on the jobs that span from small 
business ventures to large-scale national projects. For smaller 
contractors looking to explore new markets, we provide access 
to a pool of well-trained workers who can meet the demands of 
these new opportunities.
    Meanwhile, larger contractors, particularly those involved 
in mega projects related to the CHIPS and Science Act, the 
Inflation Reduction Act, and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act, also benefit from our training programs.
    Since 2023, more than 4,500 Members within our three-State 
council have been employed in projects stemming from these 
acts, including Intel, Ford Blue Oval, and numerous renewable 
energy projects, covering solar, hydro, and wind. These 
initiatives require a workforce that is both large and highly 
skilled, which our program delivers.
    Since our inception in 1881, the UBC has organized the 
membership necessary to meet contractor and end-user needs. Our 
privately funded training keeps us ahead of the curve. We 
understand that if our signatory contractors are not 
successful, we will not be successful. We have no seniority in 
our collective bargaining agreements, and no contractor is 
bound to employ a Member they find unproductive. This 
competitive environment is necessary for our success, and this 
is done at no cost to the taxpayer.
    In summary, our apprenticeship program and continuing 
education initiatives are designed to support both our Members 
and the contractors they serve. We provide cost-free, high-
quality training that focuses on safety, competitiveness, 
career advancement, and long-term development. By doing so, we 
help drive economic growth, foster innovation, and build a 
workforce that is ready to meet the challenges of today and 
tomorrow.
    Thank you for your time.
    Chairman MOLINARO. Well done. Thank you.
    I appreciate all of you.
    We will begin the question round under the 5-minute rule. 
And with that, I recognize myself for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Gamba, I want to start with you. We have talked about 
this extensively. Certainly, acknowledging that, since the 
pandemic, nearly 2 million Americans with disabilities have 
joined the workforce; it is a 28 percent increase from pre-
pandemic levels. Yet as we all recognize, approximately 70 
percent of those with intellectual, physical, and developmental 
disabilities remain unemployed and outside the workforce. And 
that is obviously both a challenge and an opportunity.
    Could we start by just talking, if you would, what are some 
of the challenges that business owners either articulate or you 
know face when hiring those with disabilities, and what steps 
might we take to make that transition into the workforce easier 
for the employer?
    Ms. GAMBA. I think they are often worried or concerned 
about, like, the stigma or the liability of hiring somebody 
that might need additional supports. As an agency, we--if we 
are going in to provide any intensive----
    Chairman MOLINARO. You can continue.
    Ms. GAMBA.--intensive, you know, job training support, we 
will add the employer on to our liability insurance, which will 
kind of, I guess, alleviate some of the concerns that an 
employer may have.
    Chairman MOLINARO. Those--so those supports through likely 
the support staff and what have you, what are the challenges, 
then, the agency faces in providing those--that support?
    Ms. GAMBA. Employers may be concerned about having the 
individuals onsite. They might not communicate very well, 
allowing us to provide any intervention that may be needed. And 
then workplace accommodations, there is often a concern about 
any money that a small business would have to spend.
    Chairman MOLINARO. So why don't you tell us one of the 
benefits or at least we identify the benefits that that 
employer would see by bringing in and ultimately employing an 
individual with a disability.
    Ms. GAMBA. I think that it helps with turnover. Our--the 
individuals that we put into different small businesses have 
identified that they have the skills for the job and the 
interest in working there. So if we are in there helping with 
any intensive job training or supports, they tend to remain 
employed for longer periods of time and it reduces turnover.
    Chairman MOLINARO. Thank you, Ashley.
    Frank, let me say this without question. The skilled trades 
are the backbone of upstate New York.
    Mr. STENTO. Thank you.
    Chairman MOLINARO. And, frankly, you all contribute both to 
our economy, keeping our neighbors employed, and I will say, 
making sure that projects are staffed by New Yorkers and not 
employment from out of State or out of country.
    You talk a lot about--and, of course, Mr. McGarvey 
acknowledged--the earn-while-you-learn apprenticeship model. 
Can you just expand a little bit on the benefits of registered 
apprenticeships? And within the time I have, what steps can we 
take to expand access to and support those registered 
apprenticeship programs?
    Mr. STENTO. Sure. Thank you.
    You know, one thing in addition to what I had already 
mentioned in my testimony would be hour one our apprentices are 
starting to gain contributions towards their healthcare and 
towards their retirement. In addition, they have structured pay 
raises that are--that we work with the New York State 
Department of Labor throughout their apprenticeship program as 
they move--as they progress through that. They have eligibility 
for employee assurance programs.
    And then the biggest thing that I would say an advantage 
for an apprentice coming in would be they are building up a 
skilled craft that is highly--that is in very high demand, 
highly marketable. And once they learn that skilled craft from 
our journey workers and our small business owners when they are 
out in the field, there is nobody that can take that away from 
them. They are going to have the ability to go and provide for 
themselves and their families for the rest of their lives.
    So one thing that I will say that something that our 
government partners could assist with would be looking into 
more apprenticeship language on all projects moving forward, 
which would incentivize our small business owners, our 
contractors, to increase the ratios of apprentices on projects 
upcoming.
    Chairman MOLINARO. Thank you for that. I will say, in local 
government, the first step we took was to require apprentice 
language in our major contracts, which just enhances the 
pipeline and gets folks from maybe K-12, right, into the 
workforce and prepared.
    I do want to note before acknowledging Mr. McGarvey, the 
more usual than you would imagine bipartisan support for both 
trying to advance those with disabilities into the workforce 
and the trades on the ground.
    And with that, let me acknowledge Mr. McGarvey for his 5 
minutes.
    Mr. MCGARVEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you to all of the witnesses for being here today, for 
your incredibly thoughtful testimony. We really appreciate it. 
And want to give a special thanks to Mr. Strange who came up 
here from my region of the country.
    And, Mr. Chairman, you talked about how the trades are the 
backbone of upstate New York, and certainly in Louisville, 
Kentucky, we feel the same way. I say all the time, Louisville 
is a union town. And truly, from the fact that every Ford 
Escape and every Ford F-250 and above is made in Louisville, 
Kentucky, and that our baseball bats and even our bourbon are 
made with union labor right there in Louisville, Kentucky. And 
we--we appreciate all the carpenters from Local 175 do for our 
city and our community.
    With apprenticeships' proven track record of success--I 
think that is important here. We are not talking about 
something theoretical. We know that these apprenticeship 
programs work--it seems that it is a wasted opportunity to not 
continue investing in these programs. So I am excited to have 
this hearing today to uplift these initiatives, as the Chairman 
said, in a bipartisan way.
    Mr. Strange, I am going to start with you. How has the 
increased availability and popularity of the apprenticeship 
programs changed the calculus of young people who are looking 
for the next step, and what are you seeing on the ground?
    Mr. STRANGE. Well, as I addressed in my opening remarks, we 
have seen 40 percent growth in 3 years alone inside of our 
apprenticeship programs. We are seeing more and more involved 
at the CT level at the high schools, increased partnerships at 
high schools, and also other entry-level pathways for us.
    So with that, we are just seeing more and more 
availability, more opportunities to grow. And also, we are 
seeing a better view of the general public on who we are and 
what we have to offer, especially with parents of children that 
are coming out of these programs. We actually do nights with 
them specifically to be able to explain to them who we are, why 
we are going to provide that safe work environment for their 
children whenever they come out. That is a big concern from 
parents. So we found some trade on those type of efforts.
    Mr. MCGARVEY. Appreciate that. I think two things we have 
agreed on today and that we know, we know apprenticeship 
programs work, we know that small businesses right now need 
qualified workers. And so we are trying to get that done.
    When you are looking at the apprenticeship program, how 
many of your apprenticeship programs are--your apprentices are 
going to small businesses to work in those sectors, and how are 
they kind of helping small businesses fill those gaps and meet 
their goals in terms of having qualified workers?
    Mr. STRANGE. So as Frank talked about earlier in his 
portion as well, you know, with the larger projects that are 
coming along, that is offering opportunity for a lot of smaller 
businesses to step in. By us providing the skilled workforce 
for them to be able to have to go provide the workforce they 
need on these projects, and then also the training that they 
need to be able to--and we are seeing a lot of job sites that 
have requirements on them for certifications for Members to be 
able to hold--we provide that training opportunity for them and 
also provide that opportunity for that workforce.
    Mr. MCGARVEY. And, Mr. Stento, I will go over to you as 
well. Mr. Strange just mentioned a 40 percent increase in their 
apprenticeship programs. Are you seeing similar type numbers in 
your area?
    Mr. STENTO. We are seeing significant increases. We 
actually just had our largest apprenticeship class since I have 
been on staff, which is over 6 years, about 250 apprentices 
that are going to be coming in for this coming school year. So 
there has been, and it has been intentional, right.
    We see the need to work with our retirees that are coming 
up with the mega projects that we are going to have to have 
some urgency that has to be strategic and how we intend to 
fulfill these projects. So there has been, yes, a major 
increase in our Members as well and other trades in the Broome 
County region.
    Some of our apprenticeship programs, the carpenters up 
there just a little north of Broome County, in Onondaga, just 
opened up a new training facility. Plumbers and pipefitters are 
doing the same thing, all in the anticipation of increased 
apprenticeship numbers so that we are able to fulfill pipeline 
to our small business owners in years to come.
    And then these apprentices will eventually be the future of 
our--they are the future of our workforce and of the industry, 
and they will be able to, in a short period of time, 
relatively, have the skills necessary to be then mentoring and 
teaching the generation following them.
    Mr. MCGARVEY. And thank you so much. As we run out of time, 
I will just underscore your point. You said that they are, in 
fact, the future of your workforce. We have got these major 
projects coming up, things coming up from the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law, et cetera.
    But by being the future, we also know and agree that is the 
backbone of our community, the future of our community as well. 
So we appreciate that testimony.
    Chairman MOLINARO. Thank you, Mr. McGarvey.
    Let me now recognize for 5 minutes the gentlewoman from 
California, Ms. Chu.
    Ms. CHU. Well, I want to thank all the witnesses for all 
your great work in putting people to work. So thank you for 
that.
    Mr. Strange, you have helped individuals from so many walks 
of life enter the job market prepared and trained in the 
incredibly important field of carpentry, which is especially 
critical for taking full advantage of the investments made by 
the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law.
    I believe local workforce training facilities are a key 
component to meeting this growing need and supporting our 
nation's workers, which is why I secured community project 
funding for two workforce development and job training 
facilities in my district. This includes the Pasadena 
facilities for jobs creation training and education center. It 
recognizes the fact that a 4-year college degree is not for 
everybody. And this will help connect high school age students 
to vocational training for so many different fields, including 
EMT training, automotive technology, construction, and building 
trades, and even robotics.
    So I would like to hear you talk about how community-based 
job training programs like this one can help support 
apprenticeship programs offered by unions like yours. How can 
these types of programs work together to help build a bigger 
pipeline into important trades like carpentry?
    Mr. STRANGE. Yes. So one of the ways that we already have 
established in our area is that we can provide an articulation 
agreement along with them. So if they have the requirements met 
inside of their training facilities, that can be a direct entry 
pathway into our programs.
    So with that, as long as everything inside of those 
facilities is there in line, we work together with to create 
that, and we also provide a curriculum pathway to be able to 
provide for those that want with our own internal UBC-designed 
program for that type of need.
    Ms. CHU. Okay. That is wonderful.
    I would like to have Mr. Strange and then Mr. Stento answer 
this question, which is, the work you do is a testament to the 
strength and importance of our nation's unions. Because 
Democrats passed and President Biden signed into law the 
landmark Inflation Reduction Act, so many new job opportunities 
in the green energy space have become available, which you 
mentioned in your testimony.
    And because the Inflation Reduction Act provided special 
bonus tax credits to businesses that pay prevailing wages and 
support registered apprenticeship programs on their projects, 
unions play a critical role in providing the specialized on-
the-job training to apprentices on these projects.
    So can you talk about the role that unions and their 
workers play in developing the diverse and skilled workforce 
that our country needs?
    Mr. STRANGE. I can speak to that one directly in our area. 
So first off, you addressed on there because of the strong 
apprenticeship requirements on these projects that has given 
our contractors a leg up and be able to. With the solar 
industry in particular, we have partnered together with many 
manufacturers that have come in. We provided the training that 
they have had for their specific products, and we have been 
able to meet the needs going out on to those. And currently, 
this year alone, we have produced over 2 million work hours in 
our three-State council to be able to meet the needs on and--
because of those acts.
    Mr. STENTO. Okay. So in our industry, we cover--two of the 
crafts that we cover, I think, would fall underneath this. 
Industrial coatings, bridges, tanks, water towers, which we 
have certifications for--for the coatings applicators, as well 
as for the contractors that are performing these. And as you 
mentioned, part of some of these tax credits are tied into 
apprenticeships.
    So we are seeing an uptick in--you know, from the 
engineers, as well as developers, working more in tandem with 
our signatory contractors.
    Another craft that we cover is glass glazing architectural 
metal. So you have got dynamic glass, you have got 179D tax 
credits that are--that do have some overlap with that industry 
as well. Green energy, total building envelope.
    So this is something that we have, what is called a--it is 
a third-party certification, North American contractor 
certification on the small business owner's side. And then with 
the actual installer, it is an architectural glass and metal 
technician certification.
    But you are seeing these specified in a lot more projects 
so that there is less rework, but also so that the design is--
that is intended, especially when you are looking for energy 
reduction, is completed by--by a competent installer and 
contractor as well. So we are seeing the architects working on 
those tax credits with our contractors.
    Ms. CHU. Thank you. I yield pack.
    Chairman MOLINARO. Thank you, Ms. Chu.
    We have gone through the first round of questions. We are 
going to actually just do a second round. I know Chairman 
Williams wanted to also ask a couple questions.
    So without objection, we will begin a second round. We will 
make that relatively quick for all of you.
    I will start with Ms. Gamba. Just--let's--we talked a 
little bit about the pieces of legislation that we have worked 
together on, the Think DIFFERENTLY About Disability Employment 
Act, the Think DIFFERENTLY Small Business Accessibility Act, 
really trying to get the federal government to partner and use 
the resources it has to assist organizations like your own.
    If you had a magic wand, what would be the support or 
resources necessary to expand your workforce opportunity 
programming? Other than money, which, of course, we recognize 
is necessary.
    Ms. GAMBA. I think that the onboarding process for many 
small businesses has to be more accessible. So I think if my--
if I could use a magic wand, that would be it. I think a lot of 
the individuals that we support in our labor pool are often not 
able to pass the initial assessments or anything that pertain 
to online onboarding.
    So I think that right now that would be my biggest barrier. 
And if that is something that I had a magic wand, I would fix.
    Chairman MOLINARO. Terrific. Thanks very much.
    Frank, just because you both come from my neck of the 
woods, what would you want folks at home to know about both the 
location of opportunities, apprenticeship language, and 
confront at least maybe one or two of the, how shall I say, 
perhaps--I don't want to say stigmas, but observations people 
have about sometimes employing the trades. How would you 
overcome some of those--some hesitance in the community and 
make those connections that would keep our friends employed?
    Mr. STENTO. Okay.
    Chairman MOLINARO. If you know what I am asking.
    Mr. STENTO. I am. I think I am following.
    So as far as--you know, we refer a lot of times not--
discussing union labor, but local labor. So this is a smart way 
of our taxpayers to be spending their money.
    For every dollar invested with our local union workforce in 
our surrounding areas, it is having a direct impact in the 
community and the taxpayer base that are funding these 
projects. So that would be one way that I would dissuade anyone 
who was hesitant in utilizing union workforce.
    Back to the first part of the question discussing the tax 
incentives and subsidies, apprenticeship language, it makes 
sense. We are here talking about the lack of skilled personnel 
in our--in the workforce in various industries, specifically 
for me, construction.
    So it would--to me, that would be a way to get more 
contractors hiring, putting apprentices on, boosting our 
ratios, so that we are flush with skilled workforce 5 to 8 
years from now.
    Chairman MOLINARO. I thank you, Frank.
    That concludes my questions. I will yield the balance of my 
time. My colleagues physically to my right, metaphorically to 
my left, are going to pass, and we will acknowledge Chairman 
Williams for his 5 minutes.
    Mr. WILLIAMS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And some of you may not know, but I played professional 
baseball for the Atlanta Braves. And notice I said some and not 
many of you would know. There is a difference. But I did play 
with the Atlanta Braves, and there is really nothing that 
brings people together like the America's pastime.
    And, Ms. Gamba, I noticed that your organization, we talked 
about it this morning, partnered with the Legends of Yankee 
Stadium to help people with disabilities find meaningful 
employment. So my question is, what types of roles are these 
individuals performing at the historic Yankee Stadium, and are 
there other opportunities your organization is exploring?
    Ms. GAMBA. So Legends operates concessions at Yankee 
Stadium. So the individuals that we--are placed in there are 
working in merchandising, retail, and food service primarily.
    If we have any individuals that have a specific interest, 
such as maybe human resources, they have been open to putting 
them in internships in those sites as well.
    Mr. WILLIAMS. A lot of opportunities.
    Ms. GAMBA. And I would love to get into the Mets, but 
that----
    Mr. WILLIAMS. Well, there is your Met man right there.
    Ms. GAMBA. I know.
    Mr. WILLIAMS. He is ready to make the deal. That is a great 
program.
    Ms. GAMBA. Yep.
    Mr. WILLIAMS. I think MLB is familiar with it, aren't they, 
Major League Baseball?
    Ms. GAMBA. Well, our partnership is with Legends, so that 
is all I can speak to.
    Mr. WILLIAMS. Yeah. But it could be some--it could grow. 
That is very good.
    There has been a significant shortage in skilled labor 
across the country for way too long. And when I was secretary 
of state of Texas, we were always looking into infrastructure 
projects, but we kept running into the issue of finding enough 
welders and other skilled tradesmen to complete the projects. 
We actually lost a lot of business because we didn't have 
welders in Texas.
    Mr. Stento, I have worked with different community colleges 
around my district to emphasize their trade school programs. 
And so how do you think we should be promoting these options to 
young people so we can build up the skilled workforce and let 
them know there is options out there other than being a lawyer 
or an architect or something?
    Mr. STENTO. Thank you, Chairman Williams. I appreciate the 
question.
    It is something that over the last 2 years I have spent a 
lot of time within our district council working on is 
increasing our branding and our awareness, and that doesn't 
happen with just one touch or one conversation with our youth. 
This has to happen early and it has to happen often.
    I am talking about getting in and speaking with youth in 
elementary school or even earlier, and working with them over 
years bringing an identity to what we do in the trades, to the 
projects that we worked on in the community, to testimonials 
from those community members who would be able to speak to how 
these careers have helped transform their lives.
    So early, often, and getting in before discussing with 
seniors in high school, who have already had time to make up 
their minds elsewhere.
    Mr. WILLIAMS. We lose 100,000 kids a year in Texas. They 
are dropping out of the ninth grade. And those are the kids we 
need to reach out to and let them learn a trade and be very 
successful in the economy.
    Mr. STENTO. I agree.
    Mr. WILLIAMS. Yeah. Mr. Strange, I wanted to ask you a 
similar question. Can you talk about some of the work you are 
doing to try to get high schoolers who may not know what they 
want to do with their futures into the skilled workforce?
    Mr. STRANGE. Absolutely. First off, real quick, I want to 
address the welding concern. We have seven training facilities 
that we have CWI certifications inside of and, therefore, 
provide the welding needs that are needed in our area. So if 
Texas is needing, we got them for you.
    Mr. WILLIAMS. Tell them to call Governor Abbott.
    Mr. STRANGE. So one of the ways--and we are actually in the 
season right now where we are doing this. We have open house 
events. So we are currently--yesterday we hosted one at one of 
our facilities. We have another one to follow tomorrow.
    As of right now, at five of our facilities to point this 
year, we have had over 2,500 high school students come through 
our facilities to be able to see and tour that. Along with 
that, we also do a program where we invite back those students 
that come, we invite their parents to come meet with us. We do 
an evening with them, and we tell them about the opportunity we 
have, the career options that we have for their kids--for their 
students to possibly enter into. We have actually even had some 
parents enroll in our program after they have come and seen who 
we are and what we do.
    Mr. WILLIAMS. Well, that is great. You may--I am sure you 
have already touched on it, Mr. Chairman. But we have a bill 
that basically in simple terms makes the State colleges show 
these kids what it costs to go to a State university as opposed 
to a trade school. Big difference; affecting student debt and 
all the things we hear about that come from that. So we need to 
continue to do that.
    I don't think the economy is complete until we have a 
workforce who is complete with trades. And we will never run 
out of that. So appreciate what you are doing.
    I yield my time back.
    Chairman MOLINARO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We appreciate 
that.
    As a long-suffering Mets fan, if we never had to travel to 
Atlanta again, we would be much happier. Just saying.
    With that, that concludes our round of questioning. I do 
want to thank all three of you for your testimony today and 
being here in Washington with us.
    Again, as mentioned, clearly bipartisan, and this Committee 
does distinguish itself under Mr. Williams--Chairman Williams' 
leadership in acting in a bipartisan way.
    So without objection, Members have 5 legislative days to 
submit additional materials and written questions for the 
witnesses to the Chair which will be forwarded to the 
witnesses.
    The Ranking Member and I would love at the conclusion of 
the meeting just to take a quick photograph with our witnesses 
to show our continued support.
    If you would, to any written requests, we would ask 
witnesses to promptly respond.
    And if there is no other business to come before the 
Committee, without objection, the Committee is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 10:56 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
