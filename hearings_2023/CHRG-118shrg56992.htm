   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM 
             OREGON, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON FINANCE

    The Chairman. The Finance Committee will come to order, and 
we are happy to welcome the Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, 
this morning.
    Everyone here, regardless of political views, understands 
that the FDIC, the Fed, and the Treasury Department are putting 
in long hours to contain the fallout of the recent bank 
closures. The process is moving forward under existing law. 
Investigations are underway at the SEC and the Department of 
Justice.
    Senator Brown, Chair of the Banking Committee and a valued 
member of this committee, is determined to get to the bottom of 
exactly what went wrong. Nerves are certainly frayed at this 
moment. One of the most important steps that Congress can take 
now is to make sure there are no questions about the full faith 
and credit of the United States.
    That means paying the bills incurred by Presidents of both 
parties and taking a default off the table. With respect to the 
budget debate, after a request from myself and Senator 
Whitehouse, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office did the 
math on the recent fiscal promises we have heard from House 
Republicans.
    The promises pile up, but the numbers do not add up. They 
wish to balance the budget in 10 years, but they have announced 
a long list of untouchables. No reductions in defense, no cuts 
to Medicare or Social Security, no touching veteran's programs, 
no asking the wealthy or corporations to pay their fair share. 
A couple of these items could get bipartisan support, but 
certainly not all of them.
    Senator Whitehouse and I asked the Congressional Budget 
Office to run the numbers. Is it even possible for Republicans 
to stand behind those commitments? Does the math add up? Madam 
Secretary, you and I have talked about this. The numbers do not 
add up; not even close. What the Budget Office found is that 
for Republicans to make the math work, they would have to cut 
every Federal program by 86 percent.
    Goodbye to Medicaid and the guarantee of nursing home 
coverage, which I saw when I was director of the Gray Panthers. 
The border would be unprotected. Roads and bridges would 
crumble. If Republicans want to extend the Trump tax law, they 
would have to cut everything else.
    Given that, it is not a big mystery why House Republicans 
have not yet put a budget on paper, a budget to show the 
public. They are living way, way out there. Democrats are 
following a smarter approach. The President has put out a 
budget that is based on a simple proposition: help working 
families, help the middle class get ahead, reduce the deficit 
at the same time, and show that these matters are not mutually 
exclusive.
    I am just going to highlight a few budget matters that are 
important to the Treasury. First, last week the committee had a 
very good bipartisan hearing on affordable housing. This is an 
area where I believe there is a clear opportunity for 
bipartisan cooperation. The budget proposes expanding the Low-
Income Housing Tax Credit, creating the Neighborhood Homes 
program, and other ideas.
    Senator Cantwell, Senator Cardin, Senator Young--they are 
championing bipartisan efforts. I am going to work with them 
closely on these proposals and more. This crisis needs a 
solution. There is no substitute--and you and I have talked 
about this as well, Madam Secretary--for increasing the supply 
of housing.
    Second, the budget calls for expanding two of the most 
significant sources of support for working people and families: 
the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit. When the 
Congress passed these expansions in 2021, there were huge, 
almost immediate reductions in poverty. With a little bit of 
help, millions of working Americans felt like they could 
breathe for the first time. I would like for them to have that 
feeling of relief once again.
    And third, we have talked for a long time about the need to 
address the basic unfairness of America's two-tiered tax 
system--one set of rules for people who work for a living: 
firefighters, nurses, teachers. They pay their taxes out of 
every paycheck. Then there is another set of rules for the very 
wealthy, who can pay what they want when they want to and, for 
years on end, little or nothing.
    Although the President and I have proposed slightly 
different ideas for addressing the unfairness, we are rowing in 
the same direction.
    One final issue. I've got serious concerns about the 
administration's approach to implementing a portion of the 
Inflation Reduction Act that deals with sourcing critical 
minerals. Free trade agreements cannot be unilaterally decided 
by the executive branch. They require consultation and consent 
from the Congress. That includes any agreement on critical 
minerals.
    Secretary Yellen, thank you again for being with us. I know 
you have a hectic schedule. We are going to have a wide-ranging 
discussion. We look forward to question and answers, and I 
understand that you have a hard stop at 1 o'clock, so we will 
all try to keep it short and get to questions.
    Senator Crapo?
    [The prepared statement of Chairman Wyden appears in the 
appendix.]

             OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE CRAPO, 
                   A U.S. SENATOR FROM IDAHO

    Senator Crapo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and 
welcome to today's hearing, Secretary Yellen. I appreciate you 
appearing before the committee in a timely manner, following 
the release of the President's budget.
    While the budget is the focus of today's hearing, I expect 
that the emergency measures that have been taken this weekend 
by Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC will also be 
appropriately discussed today. It is important to learn more 
about what initiated the run on Silicon Valley Bank, the impact 
of the Federal Reserve holding interest rates low for too long, 
and what steps were--or were not--taken by SVB and the banking 
regulators.
    In the meantime, I am concerned about the precedent of 
guaranteeing all deposits and the market expectation moving 
forward. Once started, moral hazard, like inflation, is not 
easily contained and does long-lasting damage.
    Inflation played a key role in the recent bank failures, as 
rising interest rates and mismanaged interest rate risk led to 
a liquidity crisis. Indeed, there is no issue more critical 
than the unacceptably high inflation that American families 
continue to face every day. Americans have now experienced 16 
months of inflation at or above 6 percent. Costs of rent, 
groceries, and services continue to rise. Wages cannot keep up. 
Last year, the administration committed to working in a 
bipartisan fashion to address this serious problem, noting the 
budget must complement monetary policy.
    Instead, what we have seen is a reckless tax-and-spend 
agenda that was forced through Congress, rolling out trillions 
of dollars in debt-financed spending and hundreds of billions 
of dollars in new tax increases on U.S. job creators. The 
Congressional Budget Office says the Inflation Reduction Act 
will not only increase inflation in the near term, but Treasury 
will collect less corporate tax revenue with the partisan IRA 
in effect, despite being sold as a bill to make corporations 
pay their fair share.
    The Federal Reserve is having to compensate for this by 
growing interest rate hikes. Rising interest rates are 
impacting household budgets, the Federal Government's coffers, 
and as we saw this week, our banking system.
    The President's budget demonstrates the administration has 
not learned from its mistakes. After 2 years of policies that 
contributed to record-high inflation and excessive deficit 
spending, this administration is doubling down with more of the 
same.
    The spending binge must stop. We must address our growing 
deficits in order to put the United States' finances on a 
sustainable path, and pro-growth tax policy should be a part of 
the solution.
    The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act led to one of the strongest 
economies in generations. The TCJA introduced competitive tax 
rates while broadening the base, including by enacting the 
first global minimum tax of its kind and putting an end to 
corporate inversions. It also contributed to record-high 
corporate tax receipts, both nominally and as a share of gross 
domestic product.
    But instead of considering bipartisan, pro-growth policies, 
the President's budget includes a whopping $4.7 trillion of new 
and increased taxes on American job creators, which ultimately 
means fewer jobs and lower wages. It also includes higher taxes 
on American energy producers.
    Earlier today, Senator Barrasso and a number of his 
Republican colleagues, including myself, sent a letter to you, 
Secretary Yellen, raising concerns with the over-$100 billion 
in increased energy taxes proposed in the President's Fiscal 
Year 2024 budget. Mr. Chairman, I ask that this letter be 
included in the record.
    The Chairman. Without objection, so ordered.
    [The letter appears in the appendix beginning on p. 54.]
    Senator Crapo. The administration's short-sighted, partisan 
agenda extends to its unilateral approach to the OECD 
international tax agreement. For the last 2 years, Treasury has 
used the OECD negotiations to attempt to compel changes in U.S. 
law without regard for the effect on U.S. revenue, U.S. 
companies, and U.S. workers. Not only has the administration 
failed to put a stop to digital services taxes, but now foreign 
countries threaten to impose extraterritorial taxes on U.S. 
companies under the global minimum tax at Treasury's 
invitation.
    The latest OECD guidance confirms the administration has 
agreed to allow foreign countries to collect U.S. GILTI 
revenue, and worse, tax U.S. companies on their U.S. profits, 
in violation of our existing tax treaties. The budget fails to 
consider these revenue impacts, which, if implemented, will 
result in billions of dollars of lost U.S. revenue.
    Meanwhile, the administration continues to hide its true 
intentions for ``transforming'' the IRS. The budget doubles 
down on the $80 billion already given to the IRS, including 2 
additional years of plus-up funding totaling $29.1 billion 
solely for ``enforcement and compliance initiatives,'' in 
addition to $14.1 billion more of yearly funding. That is 
another $43 billion!
    Secretary Yellen, I agree with you that having a funding 
plan for an agency budget that dwarfs many others is 
``critical.'' In the meantime, the IRS has embarked on a 
``spend first, plan later'' approach that is not transparent or 
responsible, and is a sure-fire recipe for error, waste, and 
mismanagement.
    While we may not have all the details yet, we do know that 
only 6 percent of this existing plus-up funding is for 
modernization, while over 62 percent is solely for hiring--more 
than 93 percent of which is enforcement hiring.
    These new funds are not going to replace retiring IRS 
agents, as annual appropriations already provide that funding, 
and the administration has not requested any reductions in IRS 
annual funding to account for replacing retirees with plus-up 
up funding.
    Secretary Yellen, there are opportunities for the 
administration to work across the aisle on common-sense 
economic policies, but nothing suggests the President is 
abandoning the partisan tax-and-spend policies of the last 2 
years.
    This administration must recommit to working with 
Republicans to develop real solutions that will stabilize the 
economy and create higher wages and opportunities for American 
workers.
    Thank you very much.
    [The prepared statement of Senator Crapo appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. Thank you; thank you very much, Senator 
Crapo.
    Our witness today will be Secretary Janet Yellen. She is 
the first person to have led the White House Council of 
Economic Advisors, the Federal Reserve, and the Treasury 
Department. She is also the first woman to lead the Treasury 
Department.
    Before leading Treasury and the Federal Reserve, she was a 
distinguished fellow in residence at the Brookings Institution. 
She served as president of the American Economic Association. 
She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Science and 
the Council on Foreign Relations. She also was a founding 
member of the Climate Leadership Council.
    We welcome you, Secretary Yellen, and please proceed.

STATEMENT OF HON. JANET L. YELLEN, SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF THE 
                    TREASURY, WASHINGTON, DC

    Secretary Yellen. Thank you. Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member 
Crapo, and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me 
here today. I would like to start with an update on the recent 
developments in the banking system. This week, the government 
took decisive and forceful actions to stabilize and strengthen 
public confidence in our financial system.
    First, we worked with the Federal Reserve and FDIC to 
protect all depositors of the two failed banks. On Monday 
morning, customers were able to access all of the money in 
their deposit accounts, so they could make payroll and pay the 
bills. Shareholders and debt holders are not being protected by 
the government.
    Importantly, no taxpayer money is being used or put at risk 
with this action. Deposit protection is provided by the Deposit 
Insurance Fund, which is funded by fees on banks.
    Second, the Federal Reserve is providing additional support 
to the banking system with a new lending facility. This will 
help financial institutions meet the needs of all of their 
depositors. I can reassure the members of the committee that 
our banking system is sound, and that Americans can feel 
confident that their deposits will be there when they need 
them. This week's actions demonstrate our resolute commitment 
to ensure that our financial system remains strong, and that 
depositors' savings remain safe.
    Now let me turn to the topic of the hearing, the 
President's Fiscal Year 2024 budget. Over the past 2 years, the 
United States has experienced a historic economic recovery. In 
January of 2021, our country was in the middle of an economic 
calamity, triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.
    But Congress and the President took decisive action through 
the American Rescue Plan and our vaccination campaign, and 
today our unemployment rate is near historic lows. We have seen 
the strongest 2 years of business creation in history. Now our 
task is to navigate our economy's transition from rapid 
recovery to sustainable growth. This includes bringing down 
inflation.
    We have seen some moderation in headline inflation, but 
more work needs to be done. Our administration will continue to 
build on the actions we have taken to expand supply and provide 
cost relief in areas like energy and health care.
    With your partnership, we have also laid a foundation for 
long-term economic growth. In just the past 2 years alone, 
Congress passed three transformational laws: a generational 
investment in infrastructure, a historic expansion of American 
semiconductor manufacturing, and the largest investment in 
clean energy in our Nation's history.
    The strategic priority for our administration this year is 
to work with you to effectively implement these laws. We are 
seeing the early results. In just 7 months, there has been a 
wave of investments in clean energy manufacturing across the 
country, and our new resources for the IRS are already paying 
off. Taxpayers are getting drastically improved customer 
service this year.
    For example, we have answered hundreds of thousands more 
phone calls during this filing season than at this time last 
year. Our proposed budget builds on our economic progress by 
making smart, fiscally responsible investments. These 
investments would be more than fully paid for by requiring 
corporations and the wealthiest to pay their fair share.
    Fiscal discipline remains a central priority in our budget. 
We have proposed a minimum income tax of 25 percent on 
taxpayers with wealth in excess of $100 million. We have also 
proposed an increase of the corporate tax rate to 28 percent 
from the current 21 percent, and it will come as no surprise 
that I hope Congress will implement the United States' part of 
the global minimum tax deal.
    On the spending side, we suggest additional investments to 
boost our long-term growth potential. This includes improving 
the availability of high-quality child care, providing free and 
universal preschool, and boosting the supply of affordable 
housing. We also propose restoring the Child Tax Credit and 
Earned Income Tax Credit expansions that were enacted in 2021 
but have since expired.
    Importantly, with the proposed tax reforms, we estimate 
that this budget will deliver deficit reduction of nearly $3 
trillion over the next 10 years.
    Thank you, and I look forward to taking your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Secretary Yellen appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. Thank you, Secretary Yellen.
    Let me begin with what I emphasized, that it is critically 
important that Congress take steps to make sure there are no 
questions about the full faith and credit of the United States. 
This is a matter within the Finance Committee's jurisdiction.
    Now on Friday, the House Ways and Means Republicans passed 
a plan dealing with what they call prioritizing payments by the 
Treasury. They say that when Treasury runs out of stopgap 
funding, it should prioritize payments to Wall Street and 
creditors and China ahead of everybody else. I am coming off 
some town hall meetings in Oregon this weekend; that would not 
be a big hit with anybody.
    Now, setting aside the merits of this Republican plan, does 
the Federal Government have the technical capacity to 
prioritize some payments ahead of others? I understand there is 
not even a precedent for this.
    Secretary Yellen. The government on average makes millions 
of payments each day, and our systems are built to pay all of 
our bills on time, and not to pick and choose which bills to 
pay. There is a reason that Treasury Secretaries of both 
parties have rejected this incredibly risky and dangerous idea, 
and it has never been tried before.
    I cannot give any assurances about the technical 
feasibility of such a plan. It would be an exceptionally risky, 
untested, and radical departure from normal payment practices 
of agencies across the Federal Government, and I consider it 
essential that Congress come together to recognize that raising 
the debt ceiling is their responsibility, to protect the full 
faith and credit in the United States.
    The Chairman. So, you have told us this prioritization 
scheme is unworkable, and House Republicans do not get to 
decide what qualifies as a Federal default. If the government 
can meet some but not all of its obligations, isn't that 
essentially the definition of a default?
    Secretary Yellen. Failing to pay all of your bills when 
they are due is what I think of as a default. The United States 
has always paid all of its bills on time, and it should stay 
that way. That has been a core American value since 1789, 
regardless of party. Presidents and Congresses have always 
honored all of our commitments, and prioritization is 
effectively a default by just another name.
    The Chairman. I appreciate you bringing us up to date on 
that, Madam Secretary.
    And, colleagues, the reason I have focused on protecting 
the full faith and credit of the United States is, this is 
explicitly within this committee's jurisdiction. So I thank 
you, Secretary Yellen.
    Let us talk about the double standard in tax enforcement. 
Too much of the burden falls on working people and the middle 
class. It is too easy for corporations and the wealthy to get 
away with cheating.
    Every time out, it seems that Republicans are trying hard 
to keep it that way. They put out an amendment to the IRA that, 
according to the Congressional Budget Office, would have led to 
even more tax avoidance by the wealthy. It would have 
encouraged billionaires to disguise their income so they appear 
to the IRS to be typical middle-class wage earners. There have 
even been Republican efforts to slow down hiring the kind of 
highly trained and dogged experts that you need to crack down 
on tax cheating by the wealthy and businesses that have very 
complicated business structures.
    Of course, the first bill out of the gate in the House was 
this $114-billion giveaway to the wealthy tax cheats and the 
tax-
dodging corporations. It would have in effect repealed the 
funding Democrats passed in the Inflation Reduction Act.
    Secretary Yellen, if Republicans had their way and repealed 
the IRS funding to go after wealthy tax cheats, what would that 
do to the agency's ability to really make sure that those 
people at the very top paid their fair share?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, it would allow the wealthy and 
large corporations to skip out on taxes they legally owe and 
make it harder for ordinary middle-class families who pay their 
taxes to get the kind of service that they deserve from the 
IRS. It would increase the tax gap and add to the deficit by 
over $114 billion.
    The Chairman. So, let us talk about improvements in 
taxpayer services. Now the IRS funding--as of early March, the 
IRS was answering 90 percent of the calls to its customer 
service lines and had reduced the backlog of individual returns 
substantially, in the ballpark of 90 percent. Now that is after 
spending roughly 1 percent of the IRA funding.
    Secretary Yellen, if Republicans were able to successfully 
repeal the Inflation Reduction Act funding, what would that 
mean for taxpayer services? The reason I ask that is, right now 
we are in the middle of the filing season, so this is not some 
kind of abstract kind of concern. What would it mean for 
taxpayer services if they repealed the funding?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, it just clearly would lead to worse 
services for taxpayers. Phones would go unanswered, wait times 
would grow, mail would be processed more slowly, refunds would 
be delayed. We are undergoing a transition to digital forms, 
and improved scanning would be delayed. Paper backlogs would 
grow, and Taxpayer Assistance Centers that are now being 
reopened and fully staffed--some of them would have to close or 
be understaffed.
    The Chairman. I am over my time.
    Senator Crapo?
    Senator Crapo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Let me start out, Madam Secretary, with the full faith and 
credit issue that my colleague Senator Wyden has raised. We 
agree that we need to protect the full faith and credit of the 
United States.
    Frankly, as I indicated in my opening statement, the 
problem that we see on the Republican side is that it is all 
tax and all spending increases in terms of the administration's 
approach to this. While you and the chairman just discussed a 
number of concerns you have with Republican ideas with regard 
to how to deal with this, the bottom line is we must stop 
trying to solve this problem by massive new spending and 
massive new taxes.
    So, we have some disagreements about how to deal with this. 
What I would ask of you is, at this point, the President has 
refused to negotiate with Republicans on fiscal restraint 
policies that they believe need to be put into place with a new 
extension of the debt ceiling.
    We must engage in negotiations to get over some of these 
disagreements, and this new debt ceiling resolution must 
include fiscal restraint. We have to get some kind of attention 
to this. I think the American public is crying out for Congress 
to pay attention to this issue and put fiscal restraint in 
place.
    Can you commit at least to negotiate with Republicans as we 
try to move forward to finding some aspects of fiscal restraint 
to put into the debt ceiling discussion?
    Secretary Yellen. Senator Crapo, the President has 
indicated that he considers it critically important to have a 
sustainable and responsible fiscal path, and he has put on the 
table in the budget a number of ideas, many ideas about how to 
grow the economy while also cutting deficits.
    This is a matter that he is very prepared to discuss and 
negotiate with Republicans, but it cannot be a condition for 
raising the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling simply must be 
raised, and to put at risk the full faith and credit of the 
United States and to threaten to cause an economic and 
financial catastrophe is not an acceptable requirement.
    Senator Crapo. Madam Secretary, I interpret your answer to 
be that you are very willing to discuss the President's budget, 
tax increases, and increased spending, but you are not willing 
to discuss, with regard to the debt ceiling discussion, any 
actual fiscal restraint in terms of spending control in the 
United States.
    Now, if I interpreted it wrong, I am sorry. But we have to 
get negotiating on more than just whether the President's 
budget is the right approach. There are other ideas, and we 
need to be engaged on them. I just hope that you will take that 
message back to the President.
    Secretary Yellen. The President has indicated that he would 
welcome discussions about the stance of fiscal policy.
    Senator Crapo. All right. I appreciate that.
    Let us move quickly to the SVB crisis and the banking 
industry. Can we agree--at least as a starter, as we try to 
understand how this is all playing out--that the issue here in 
terms of risk is liquidity risk that we are facing in the 
system, and that SVB had a liquidity risk issue?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, there was a run on the bank. It had 
high reliance on uninsured deposits, and there was a massive 
withdrawal of deposits that led to liquidity problems. The bank 
had to be closed for that reason.
    Senator Crapo. So, do you agree then that it is a liquidity 
risk that we are dealing with in this issue?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, there was a liquidity risk in this 
situation. You know, there will be a careful look at what 
happened in the bank and what initiated this problem. But 
clearly, the downfall of the bank, the reason it had to be 
closed, was that it could not meet depositors' withdrawal 
requests.
    Senator Crapo. Because their capital was losing value and 
they were not able to access their capital. And I attribute 
that to the interest rate hikes that we are seeing in the face 
of the inflation. Am I wrong in that?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, my understanding is that the bank, 
to meet liquidity needs, had to sell assets that it expected to 
hold to maturity. And given the interest rate increases that 
have occurred since those assets were purchased, including 
treasuries and 
mortgage-backed securities, they had lost market value.
    Senator Crapo. All right, yes; so we are on the same page 
on that then. I appreciate that.
    One other question with regard to the bank failure--and 
this is with regard to the efforts to get a private buyer to 
help solve this issue. Regarding these issues, the solution 
would have been to get a private-sector solution that protected 
taxpayers, calmed the markets, and prevented the potential 
assessments from being inappropriately levied against community 
banks.
    Press reports have indicated that some of the FDIC board 
members may have slow-walked the negotiations with regard to 
potential political backlash surrounding mergers and 
acquisitions, and it was because of that that we were not able 
to move forward promptly with obtaining a buyer. Are those 
reports accurate?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, this is something that is a 
question for the FDIC really, rather than me. But I know that 
the FDIC looked for buyers, and a merger-acquisition is 
certainly something that they were open to as a way to resolve 
the institution.
    Senator Crapo. All right; thank you.
    Very quickly on the OECD agreement, I am very much opposed 
to it. Yet it seems to me that Treasury is pushing for Congress 
to approve its approach to the OECD negotiations and is already 
giving support to nations around the world in the OECD to tax 
U.S. profits.
    That would be directly in conflict with U.S. tax treaties. 
Am I correct in that?
    Secretary Yellen. One hundred thiry-seven countries signed 
this agreement, and see it as a way to put a floor on taxation 
of corporations and multinational corporations and stop a race 
to the bottom. And the European Union has adopted Pillar 2, the 
global minimum tax, and other jurisdictions are moving forward 
and----
    Senator Crapo. My question----
    Secretary Yellen [continuing]. We feel it is in the U.S.'s 
interest to adopt this. We have proposed----
    Senator Crapo. I understand, Madam Secretary. My time has 
expired, and the chairman is trying to get me to wrap up.
    I do want to make one more quick statement. I would like to 
express my concern about numerous proposals in the Green Book, 
in the budget, that we will not have time to get into here 
today.
    Last year, Treasury did not provide answers to these 
questions for the record for 6 months. I just would like to ask 
you to pay attention to this this year and have your team 
respond to us promptly as we get questions for the record on 
this year's budget.
    The Chairman. Senator Grassley?
    Senator Grassley. You did not answer his last question 
about OECD and tax treaties. Is what you are proposing in any 
way a violation of the tax treaties that we have had with other 
countries?
    Secretary Yellen. No, there is no violation in anything we 
have proposed with tax treaties. We have engaged in this. It is 
something that the OECD considered very carefully, and there is 
no violation of our tax treaty.
    Senator Grassley. Well, we surely do not agree with your 
analysis of that. Only Congress has the power to approve 
treaties.
    I want to go to your position as a member of the Social 
Security board of trustees. You and other people put out in an 
annual report, quote, ``Lawmakers should address the projected 
trust fund shortfalls in a timely way in order to phase in 
necessary changes gradually and give workers and beneficiaries 
time to adjust to them.'' I do not disagree at all with that 
statement.
    President Biden has claimed that his budget reduces the 
deficits, while protecting Social Security. However, the 
President's budget includes no proposal to extend the solvency 
of the Social Security trust fund.
    Anyone who knows how things get done around here knows it 
takes presidential leadership to lead major reforms to Social 
Security. Forty years ago, that was President Reagan and a 
Democratic Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill, who put together 
a bipartisan agreement that was overwhelmingly approved by the 
Congress of the United States, and it has made Social Security 
sound, at least through 2035.
    So I assume that you stand by your recommendations that 
lawmakers act sooner rather than later to shore up the Social 
Security trust fund? So can Congress expect to see the 
President's proposal to put Social Security on a sound fiscal 
basis along the same lines, replicating the leadership of 
President Reagan and Tip O'Neill?
    Secretary Yellen. President Biden stands ready to work with 
Congress to shore up Social Security and discuss possible 
approaches, so that is a conversation that it is important for 
us to have. He has made explicit proposals in connection with 
Medicare in shoring it up, and it is important to have that 
conversation about Social Security.
    The President believes strongly that that should not 
involve cutting benefits or going back on our commitments to 
America's seniors, but certainly it is a discussion we need to 
have.
    Senator Grassley. I assume that both you and the President 
are sincere in what you just said. It would help a lot if the 
President would quit demagoguing the Social Security issue the 
way he has in recent weeks.
    I want to go to an extension of a conversation you and I 
had in June of 2021. You defended concerns about the 
President's spending proposals fueling inflation and interest 
rate hikes by saying this: ``If we ended up with a slightly 
higher interest rate environment, it would actually be a plus 
for society's point of view and the Fed's point of view.'' I 
want to emphasize ``plus for society's point of view.''
    Now, when you made that statement, inflation was 5.4 
percent and the Federal funds rate was effectively zero. Since 
that time, inflation hit a 40-year high, and the Fed has 
responded by aggressively hiking interest rates. As a result, 
families and small businesses are paying the price by way of 
higher interest rate costs for home loans and business lines of 
credit.
    Moreover, bank failures this past week highlighted how 
fragile our economy is, given rising interest rates and 
decades-long inflation. So, do you see still our inflation-
driven interest rate hikes as, using your words, ``a plus for 
society''?
    Secretary Yellen. I consider high inflation the number one 
economic problem that all of us need to face and address. It is 
the President's top priority. I was very supportive of the 
American Rescue Plan. I think there are many factors that have 
contributed to high inflation. It is critical for the Fed to 
address it, and the President is doing all that he can, both 
through the Inflation Reduction Act, lowering costs of 
prescription drugs, lowering the cost of health care, using the 
strategic petroleum reserve to try to lower and address higher 
gas and energy costs for Americans.
    It is critical for us to do what we can to bring inflation 
down, and for the Fed to do its part as well. The Inflation 
Reduction Act was enacted at a time when I believed the 
greatest threat to our economy was that unemployment would 
remain shockingly high, and that American families would be 
scarred by long-term job loss and losing the roofs over their 
heads, and I believe it was appropriate to take those actions.
    Senator Grassley. My time has run out. Just let me finally 
say this, that what you say about the Inflation Reduction Act 
reducing inflation, within the last 3 weeks the CBO says it 
increased inflation.
    I yield.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Grassley.
    Senator Cardin?
    Senator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Secretary 
Yellen, welcome. Thank you very much for your service.
    I have a question in regard to areas where we have 
bipartisan support, where we can, I hope, make progress in this 
Congress in getting some changes in our tax code, particularly 
as it deals with one of the subjects that you mentioned in your 
opening statement: affordable housing.
    We have fallen behind in affordable housing. We were able 
to make progress in a lot of areas during the last 2 years, but 
affordable housing was not one of those areas where we were 
able to advance. So, your budget includes three initiatives in 
which there is bipartisan support.
    One is to make permanent the New Markets Tax Credits. I am 
working with Senator Daines on that proposal, to get 
predictability to New Markets Tax Credits which would be great 
for, I think, 
private-sector investment.
    Another is the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, where your 
budget provides for the expansion and reform of that credit. 
Senator Cantwell and Senator Young have been leaders on this 
committee. We joined them in that effort.
    And then lastly, the Neighborhood Homes credit, which I 
have been the sponsor of and Senator Young is my cosponsor. So 
these are all bipartisan bills that we have a chance of moving 
forward.
    My suggestion is to try to see whether we can't move a 
housing tax credit program separate from the other areas where 
we might have more controversy. This is an area where we could 
perhaps get to the finish line earlier. So, could we have your 
cooperation in trying to deal with the housing tax credit bill 
that could perhaps make it to the President's desk earlier 
rather than later?
    Secretary Yellen. Absolutely, Senator Cardin. I am very 
pleased that this is an area where there is bipartisan 
agreement on the need to act. I think the United States really 
faces a housing supply gap, and we need initiatives to make 
rents more affordable and home ownership attainable for 
Americans.
    All of the programs that you mentioned--the New Markets Tax 
Credit, LIHTC, and the Neighborhood Homes tax credit--all of 
these are important initiatives, and we would look forward to 
working with Congress to try to see if we can make progress 
here.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you.
    I want to move on to another bipartisan bill that passed in 
the last Congress with overwhelming support for retirement 
savings: Secure 2.0. Are you focused on helping us implement 
that law as quickly as possible? It provides opportunities for, 
particularly, 
modest-income families to be able to take advantage of 
retirement savings opportunities, particularly with the 
refundable tax credits.
    Are you working to make the implementation of that law as 
smooth as possible, so that we can see some progress?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes, absolutely. It is an important law. 
It contains many provisions that are complex and do require 
detailed technical analysis to produce public guidance and 
regulations. But this is something that we are working hard on, 
and the IRS and Treasury's Office of Tax Policy are working to 
implement this.
    Senator Cardin. And another area where I think there is 
bipartisan support is improving the service at the IRS--and the 
modernization of its capacities. The chairman already mentioned 
the fact that you have made some progress. Actually, the 
successful answering of calls has dramatically been increased.
    Do you see continued progress being made in regards to the 
service levels being provided by the IRS as a result of funds 
made available through the Inflation Reduction Act?
    Secretary Yellen. Absolutely. This will be a very critical 
part of the IRS strategic operating plan that should be 
completed in the coming weeks. It has been a priority since Day 
1. I promised during the tax season that there would be 85-
percent customer service performance, and so far, we have been 
in that range and modernizing the way in which IRS interacts 
with taxpayers, with small businesses.
    There have already been other improvements put into effect 
that, for example, make it easier for small businesses to file 
1099 forms online, and this will be an important priority.
    Senator Cardin. I want to ask two questions for the record, 
and I will just mention them. One will deal with the section 
179(d) allocations. I have worked with Senator Crapo on this. 
The guidance from the IRS is absolutely critical in regard to 
the allocation issue. I will be asking a question for the 
record on that.
    And also, you mentioned small businesses. The R&D changes 
in the 2017 tax bill have been very much impacting the ability 
of companies to do research. I chair the Small Business 
Committee. It is having a direct impact on the SBIR program, 
which is critically important for innovation--and for national 
defense, I might say.
    So I will be asking you questions as to how we can mitigate 
the adverse impact of the change in the R&D credit as it 
affects small companies in the SBIR program.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cardin. And this committee 
is really going to dig in on this housing issue, and my view is 
we start with the proposition that the only matter that is off 
the table is taking a pass on it. We have got to act.
    Senator Cornyn, you are next.
    Senator Cornyn. Good morning, Madam Secretary.
    When you testified before this committee almost 2 years 
ago, you were asked whether inflation was transitory, and you 
told the committee that you saw important transitory influences 
at work. But you did not anticipate that inflation would be in 
any way permanent.
    You predicted our economy was on track to get back to more 
normal operation, that inflation would decline over time--
something we all hope for. To be fair, you were not the only 
person who forecast transitory inflation. The Chairman of the 
Federal Reserve, Jay Powell, did the same, as did the President 
of the United States.
    We now know that inflation rose to a level not seen in more 
than 40 years, and that inflation accelerated particularly 
following the enactment of the partisan American Rescue Plan 
Act in 2021--and then with the so-called Inflation Reduction 
Act in 2022, which together added $2.6 trillion to our national 
debt.
    Obviously, all this stimulus going into a constrained 
economy, with supply chains the way they were, workforce levels 
down, obviously was like pouring gasoline on the inflation 
fire. I know inflation has now come down to 6 percent or so, 
but that is hardly good news to my constituents, who are still 
struggling to keep up with rising costs.
    We know both record housing costs--which we have talked 
about a little bit here today--and high grocery bills are 
squeezing consumers all across the country. And to make matters 
worse, real average hourly earnings--the cash earnings of all 
workers adjusted for inflation--declined last month and are 
down over the last year.
    In other words, because of inflation, workers have gotten a 
pay cut. Well, first we saw high inflation, and then higher 
interest rates of course, and that brings me to the failure of 
the Silicon Valley Bank and another bank in this last week. 
Some have suggested that this was an example of mismanagement 
at the time of higher interest rates and higher inflation.
    Others are saying, ``Where are the regulators? Were they 
asleep at the wheel?'' Many have suggested that banking 
regulators need to focus more on regulating banks, protecting 
depositors and taxpayers, instead of straying off course and 
examining so-called 
climate-related risks and other social engineering goals. I 
think these are all fair points.
    When you look at the confluence of concerning economic 
factors, there is one unavoidable truth. We need to get our 
fiscal house in order, something that the administration pays 
lip service to but seems uninterested in working with 
Republicans to try to address.
    The President's budget proposal, of course, just makes that 
clear, because it offers more taxes, more spending, and more 
debt. Spending would be at a historical level relative to the 
economy. The national debt would continue to grow. Social 
Security and Medicare, which are on a path to insolvency--there 
is no proposal from the President to deal with these impending 
disasters.
    Of course, interest costs to service this debt would reach 
about a trillion dollars annually. Our ability to defend our 
country in an increasingly dangerous world would be diminished 
because we would be spending more money paying interest to the 
bondholders rather than paying to keep the American people 
safe.
    And Americans, of course, would be punished with trillions 
in higher taxes, at a time when tax revenues are already at 
historical levels. It is not that the American people are taxed 
too little; it is that the Federal Government continues to 
spend too much and incur too much debt, which in turn creates 
this unvirtuous cycle.
    One final point. Last year the administration pushed 
through an $80-billion blank check for the IRS, without a 
spending plan. Only in Washington, DC would Congress pass an 
$80-billion spending appropriation without any plan as to how 
it is going to be implemented. We were told, ``Well, it will be 
forthcoming.'' That is great, but that is the opposite of what 
you would do it in the real world.
    First, you would want to know what is the plan, and then 
you would ask how much does it take to finance or pay for that 
plan. Well, now the administration wants another $29 billion, 
which would bring the total up to $110 billion. This, of 
course, is going to mean more audits, more red tape, and 
violate the President's promise that no one paying less than 
$400,000 in taxes would pay any more.
    So unfortunately, the President's budget misses the mark, 
which is disappointing, but unfortunately pretty consistent 
with what we have seen from this administration.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cornyn.
    Next would be Senator Bennet, followed by Senator Cassidy.
    Senator Bennet. I am going to yield to Mr. Cassidy, if that 
is all right?
    The Chairman. Nobody can say there is no collegiality in 
the Finance Committee.
    Senator Cassidy?
    Senator Cassidy. Madam Secretary, the President keeps 
saying he does not wish to have cuts in Social Security. Is he 
aware that under current law, when the program goes broke in 9 
years, that there will be a 24-percent benefit cut for those 
who are current recipients? Is he aware of that?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, it is clear that Social Security--
--
    Senator Cassidy. But is he--I apologize for the 
interruption, but I have limited time. Is the President aware 
that when Social Security goes broke in 9 years, under current 
law there is a 24-percent cut in benefits for people who are 
currently receiving them?
    Secretary Yellen. If we do not do anything about it, I 
think that is about right, but the President will want, wants 
to strengthen Social Security----
    Senator Cassidy. In the $4.5 trillion of taxes the 
President has proposed, are any of those taxes going to shore 
up Social Security? I actually know that answer. The answer is, 
of the $4.5 trillion in taxes he has proposed, not a dime is 
going to shore up Social Security. Does the President know 
personally anybody who is dependent upon Social Security, and 
that if their benefits are cut by 24 percent, they will slide 
into poverty? It is hard for you to know, so I will give you a 
pass on that.
    Secretary Yellen. The President knows many people on Social 
Security.
    Senator Cassidy. Then why doesn't the President care?
    Secretary Yellen. He cares very deeply.
    Senator Cassidy. Then where is his plan?
    Secretary Yellen. He stands ready to work with Congress----
    Senator Cassidy. That is a lie, because when a bipartisan 
group of Senators has repeatedly requested to meet with him 
about Social Security, so that somebody who is a current 
beneficiary will not see her benefits cut by 24 percent, we 
have not heard anything on our request, and we have made 
multiple requests to meet with the President.
    Now you cannot comment on that, I realize that, but that is 
a fact, and if you have been told to say he stands ready to 
meet, I will tell you there is absolutely no evidence, because 
we have not gotten our meeting.
    Secretary Yellen. Well, I believe the President does stand 
ready to work with Congress----
    Senator Cassidy. Well, again, empirically that is not true.
    Secretary Yellen [continuing]. To address this issue.
    Senator Cassidy. Now the President, in the past, has 
proposed increasing taxes on those making over $400,000 to pay 
for it. Although he has not made that formally, he has said 
that in the past. Now he has also proposed to tax some more to 
pay for Medicare, and also to close the debt and deficit.
    So, what would the rates have to be on that 2 percent of 
Americans who earn over 400K, in order to do Medicare, the debt 
and deficit, and also to address our 75-year shortfall in 
Social Security? Do you have any sense of what the rates would 
have to be?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, he has proposed explicit increases 
in tax rates on very high income----
    Senator Cassidy. But do you think it is realistic that he 
can pay for Medicare, debt and deficit, and also address a 75-
year shortfall in Social Security, by only taxing, by only 
going--the only thing he is going to do is to lay higher taxes 
on those who make more than 2 percent.
    I am sure there is a projection of how much those rates 
would have to be. Do you, can you tell us what those rates 
would have to be to do everything he is saying?
    Secretary Yellen. I cannot tell you that, but I do know 
that he has put on the table many proposals that would raise 
very substantial revenues----
    Senator Cassidy. But of that $4.5 trillion, not a dime is 
going to Social Security. And if you have not--if you cannot 
tell me, I presume that they have not actually modeled what 
those rates would have to be, which tells me that he has 
actually not been developing his plan.
    Now, this is incredibly worrisome from a President who 
should be sympathetic with someone who, under current law, is 
going to get a 24-percent cut in their benefits.
    Secretary Yellen. The President feels, is completely 
committed to protecting seniors who rely on Social Security.
    Senator Cassidy. Now, if we doubled our debt-to-GDP ratio, 
just theoretically if you will--and aside from our 
conversation--if we doubled that debt-to-GDP ratio, what effect 
would that have on the economy?
    Secretary Yellen. So right now, in the President's budget 
proposal----
    Senator Cassidy. No, I asked you just the theoretical--
independently of the budget proposal.
    Secretary Yellen. If we were to double the debt-to-GDP 
ratio?
    Senator Cassidy. Yes.
    Secretary Yellen. I do not see why we would need to----
    Senator Cassidy. But if we did, just--you are an economist. 
If we did, what would be the effect upon the economy?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, it would tend to raise net interest 
costs.
    Senator Cassidy. Would it be a negative effect on the 
economy? Of course, it would be.
    Secretary Yellen. Yes.
    Senator Cassidy. Of course, it would be. We have actually 
modeled this. For the President to do nothing--let us assume 
that we cast aside current law and we just doubled the national 
debt--and that is what it would do--it would have a devastating 
effect upon the economy. CBO says they cannot model the 
deleterious effects that would occur because of that.
    So, we have a situation where the President has not 
proposed a single plan. He has turned down multiple requests 
for meetings with Senators, and our options are a 24-percent 
cut on a person currently receiving benefits, doubling our 
national debt--which CBO says cannot be modeled and that you 
agree would be a deleterious effect.
    And he has not modeled the tax rates that would be required 
if he just wants to raise taxes.
    Secretary Yellen. Look, what I know is that the President 
is committed to Social Security. He stands ready to work with 
Congress, and he has put on the table many, many----
    Senator Cassidy. I am out of time. I do not mean to be 
rude, but since I have had multiple requests on a bipartisan 
basis to meet with him and he has turned everyone down, that 
rings hollow.
    The Chairman. My colleague is out of time, and I would just 
caution colleagues. We have plenty of differences around here, 
but accusing witnesses of lying is over the line.
    Senator Cassidy. I accept that, and I did not mean that for 
the Madam Secretary, who is merely saying that which she has 
been told. I am saying for an empiric observation, when the 
President says he has ready to meet and he has turned down 
multiple----
    The Chairman. The time of the gentleman has expired. 
Accusing witnesses of lying----
    Senator Cassidy. But I did not accuse her.
    The Chairman. Next, we have Senator Carper.
    Senator Carper. Welcome to the Finance Committee, Secretary 
Yellen.
    Secretary Yellen. Thank you very much.
    Senator Carper. We are normally a pretty jovial group, but 
we will get back on track here in a sec. But thanks so much for 
joining us. Thanks for taking on a tough job and making us 
proud.
    As you know, one of our country's most significant 
achievements, I believe, over the last decade or so in Congress 
was the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, maybe right on 
the heels of the bipartisan infrastructure legislation that 
some of us right here at this table helped to write. In 
particular, the clean energy tax incentives included in the 
Inflation Reduction Act, which were authorized and passed by 
this committee--and a bunch of us had a chance to work on 
them--will help us to achieve our climate goals and hopefully 
save our planet, all while creating good-paying jobs here in 
the United States. That is what we call, in Delaware, a win-win 
situation.
    However, in order to realize the full potential of the law, 
it is critical that the American people are not only made aware 
of these credits, but that they have a clear guidance on their 
eligibility to benefit from these credits. This is especially 
true for some of the provisions in the law targeted to low-
income and rural communities.
    In that spirit, how is the Treasury Department working to 
increase awareness of these new clean energy incentives and 
make it as easy as possible for taxpayers to understand their 
eligibility for these credits?
    Secretary Yellen. That is an important question, and let me 
just say that this is a very top priority for Treasury and our 
Office of Tax Policy. There are enormous benefits here for 
households and for clean energy.
    We need to write numerous regulations to implement the IRA 
programs--from prevailing wage and apprenticeships to electric 
vehicles and advanced electric energy projects--and we are 
working very hard on that guidance.
    When we have devised those regulations, I think they will 
help to provide clarity that taxpayers need, to make sure that 
the goals of the IRA are met. And we will need to find ways of 
publicizing those programs, so that taxpayers know what they 
are eligible for.
    There are benefits for investing, for example, in electric 
heat pumps or energy-efficient appliances, and we will need to 
work to make sure that this information is available to 
households so they can take advantage of these credits.
    Senator Carper. Thanks for that response.
    My second question is also relating to the IRS, but IRS 
funding implementation.
    Another significant accomplishment included in the 
Inflation Reduction Act was the badly needed investment to 
revitalize the IRS, in part to help them provide that service 
to people who are going to be calling, especially as they 
prepare their tax returns.
    But as the chairman mentioned earlier, taxpayers are 
already reaping the rewards of this funding. And, since the 
passage of the law, the IRS has used, I am told, nearly $1 
billion to boost taxpayer services, including hiring thousands 
of workers to help answer phone calls and support walk-in tax 
clinics.
    Because of these investments, the IRS--listen to this. This 
is worth listening to. The IRS is, I am told, answering 90 
percent of phone calls from the taxpayers during this filing 
season. I have a friend. You ask him how he is doing, he says, 
``Compared to what?'' Well, compared to about a year ago, that 
number was not 90 percent; it was 13 percent, and that is not 
perfect, but it is one heck of a lot better than it was.
    Secretary Yellen. Sure.
    Senator Carper. And we are just getting started, and with 
the IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel at the helm--my thanks to 
everybody on this committee who supported his confirmation--
these investments will ensure that the IRS can modernize their 
technology and their workforce to meet the needs of everyday 
taxpayers, while improving the fairness of our tax system.
    Question: as the IRS puts this funding to work, how should 
policymakers like us evaluate the success of these critical 
investments, and what outcomes can the American people expect 
in the years to come? Please.
    Secretary Yellen. So, a simple metric is customer service. 
What fraction of phone calls are answered--and you mentioned 13 
percent. I promised that this tax filing season, with the money 
from the IRA, that would rise to 85 percent. We've been 
measuring it, and it varies from week to week. But it has been 
consistently between 80 and 90 percent, and there are other 
metrics we can look at: speed of refunds that taxpayers 
receive, backlogs in the amount of paper that they are dealing 
with. And I believe this money will certainly lead to faster 
responses to taxpayers, more efficient and easier ways for them 
to, for example, deposit checks directly into their accounts.
    Still, we will invent many metrics that I am sure will be 
able to enable you to monitor how this money is improving----
    Senator Carper. We welcome those metrics. Keep us heading 
in the right direction. It is very encouraging.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    Senator Bennet was gracious enough to give his time to 
Senator Cassidy, so the next three will be Senator Brown, 
Senator Thune, and then Senator Bennet.
    Senator Brown?
    Senator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Secretary Yellen, thanks for your work this weekend and our 
phone conversations, and so much of what you did for the 
financial system without taxpayers footing the bill. Thank you. 
On that I spoke to a number--on your recommendation really--of 
small businesses in Ohio that were worried about making 
payroll.
    They were all over the country. Senator Romney talked about 
his in Utah--everywhere. I spoke to banks and credit unions who 
understand how important it was to have confidence, and what 
you did gave them that confidence; so, thank you.
    Bank failures are a painful reminder about the importance 
of strong safeguards. It is the same thing--maybe it is just 
what I am thinking about so much. But it is the same thing when 
I think about the disaster in East Palestine. The railroad 
lobbyists continued just aggressively to lobby this body and to 
lobby the regulators, and they succeeded in weakening standards 
for communities and for workers and for railroad safety.
    We see the same kind of aggressive lobbying from bank 
lobbyists, to weaken standards. The administration weakened 
standards--the previous administration weakened, under 2155, 
those standards. So I appreciate how you stand up strong on 
these issues.
    Just today, earlier--you have not seen it yet--I sent you 
another regulator's letter urging you to do a full review of 
bank failures and strengthen guard rails so this does not 
happen again. So, thank you for what you have done and will 
continue to do there.
    Three pretty quick questions, I hope. The Inflation 
Reduction Act created new tax credits to support the domestic 
solar industry. As Treasury finalizes rules, will you ensure 
that China's solar industry cannot profit from these credits 
without developing a genuine domestic supply chain?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes. The purpose of--one purpose of IRA 
is to make sure that we reduce our dependence on China and have 
a strong domestic capacity, and the features of the law 
guarantee that. And we are working on guidance to implement the 
law that will lead to that result.
    Senator Brown. Thank you.
    Ohio is about to have the biggest solar manufacturer in 
North America. We will continue working on that.
    And, Mr. Chairman, you know I cannot come to this committee 
when Secretary Yellen is testifying and not bring up the Child 
Tax Credit.
    I want to thank you again for helping us. I mean, it was--
it was not unprecedented, but remarkable perhaps. We passed 
that bill in March. President Biden signed it 2 years ago; 
signed it quickly. You got it up and running, the Child Tax 
Credit, by July, and 60 million children and their families 
benefited from that.
    It was so important. We have heard some on the other side 
who find all kinds of made-up or personally made-up reasons to 
oppose the Child Tax Credit. They want to cut taxes, but not 
for middle-income and low-income families.
    President Trump's IRS Commissioner asked Congress to give 
IRS the authority necessary to establish minimum competency 
standards for paid tax preparers. These issues about CTC and 
EITC error rates are always exaggerated by the other side. My 
question is, if paid tax preparers had to demonstrate a bare 
minimum expertise, do you think we would see fewer errors with 
both EITC and CTC? Do you think Congress should give IRS this 
authority?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes, I believe that Congress should. I 
support that proposal. At present, incompetent and dishonest 
paid preparers disadvantage taxpayers and undermine confidence 
in the tax system, and I believe IRS should have the authority 
to oversee paid preparers and make sure that they help 
taxpayers file more accurate returns.
    In turn, that would protect them from penalties and 
interest costs from poor-quality advice that some now receive.
    Senator Brown. Thank you. I wish my colleagues were as 
interested in tax cheating among billionaires as they are low-
income people, but I guess that is just the way politics in 
2023 seems to work.
    Last question. I want to ask you about another fiasco that 
should be easy to avoid: the debt limit. It is the definition 
of a self-inflicted blow to the economy. Instead of ensuring we 
avoid default by paying all our bills on time, some Republicans 
are pursuing a path we all know will not work. I want you to 
comment on it.
    You said before that debt prioritization is not feasible. 
You have called it ``default by another name''--your words. But 
Republicans are moving forward anyway with a bill that ranks 
what order payments should go out. They put Wall Street and 
China at the front of the line.
    If Treasury followed this Republican plan--bearing in mind 
that China holds about a trillion dollars in U.S. debt--who 
would get paid first, China or seniors receiving Social 
Security and vets receiving VA benefits?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, if that were prioritized, China 
would get paid ahead of them. We believe, I believe that 
prioritization of payments, as you said, is default by another 
name. We need to pay our bills; we need to pay all of our 
bills.
    That willingness and commitment to be responsible in paying 
bills that have already been incurred is what underlies the 
United States' strong credit rating. And credit rating agencies 
like Fitch have already weighed in that if we were to fail to 
pay any of our bills, that would call into question whether or 
not we deserve our current credit rating.
    It is simply a recipe for economic and financial 
catastrophe, to think we can pay some of our bills and not all 
of them.
    Senator Brown. Thank you. This debt prioritization sounds 
like another version of Senator Scott's privatization of 
Medicare and Social Security. It makes no sense to the country 
and to most of us.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you. And I will just tell my colleague, 
in red counties in Oregon over the weekend, I went through this 
idea that we pay China and Wall Street first, and people were 
just stunned. So I think you made a very important point.
    Senator Bennet is next.
    Senator Bennet. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, 
Madam Secretary. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions 
about the banking situation that we are facing today. But I 
just want to start, Mr. Chairman--because I have heard this 
discussion on the other side about the deficit.
    You know, I have been here for 14 years. The deficit and 
the debt have not gotten any better over that period of time. 
But the good news is, if we want to work together, we could 
actually close the gap, because the gap is not that gigantic 
compared to the way it has been in other places.
    We could get it to a place where our government, our 
deficit, was not growing faster than our GDP. That would be a 
really good step forward. But I just want to point out that we 
need to recognize that we have this problem today, this gap, 
because of the Bush and Trump tax cuts, and the deal that made 
80 percent of the Bush tax cuts permanent--80 percent of the 
Bush tax cuts permanent--a deal that I and Tom Carper were the 
only Democrats to vote against. There were three Republicans 
who voted against it.
    And when you combine that with what we did with the Trump 
tax cuts, that is 2 percent plus 1 percent of GDP. That is 3 
percent of GDP right there. So we would have closed that gap 
and been well on our way.
    So, I know that it is going to be a mix of spending cuts, 
and it is going to be a mix of revenue, and that is how we get 
back to a place where you get 19 percent of GDP of taxes and 19 
percent of GDP of spending. That is a felicitous place for us 
to be because, maybe before we are dead, we actually will move 
beyond the political talking points and do something useful for 
our kids and our grandkids.
    But I just want the math to reflect that, and that is why I 
voted against that bill. That is why I think Tom Carper voted 
against that bill. I said, in my completely unnoticed campaign 
for President, on a debate stage with the person who became the 
President of the United States, that that was a terrible deal 
that was struck between the Obama administration and Mitch 
McConnell, frankly, to extend those tax cuts permanently.
    So, until we get to a place where we are willing to 
actually have a rational conversation about what it looks like, 
what every single State in the union I am aware of, the 
conversation they have to have, because they have a duty and a 
responsibility to actually balance their budgets----
    I am not even saying we have to balance it. Let's just get 
to a place where our debt is less than 3 percent of our GDP. We 
could make some progress, and there is not a committee in 
Congress that is better situated than this committee to do it.
    That is not even what I wanted to talk to you about. I 
wanted to talk to you about the Child Tax Credit, Madam 
Secretary, and all the evidence that we have that it worked. It 
did what it was supposed to do, and you guys did an amazing job 
of implementing it. So I am going to leave that question for 
the record as well.
    I just want to go to the banking issue that we have in 
front of us right now, Madam Secretary. It is obvious to you 
and to me that marijuana--I am going to get to the banking, but 
marijuana has been legal in Colorado for 9 years. But legal 
cannabis businesses are frozen out of the financial system, the 
finance system. Banks refuse to provide them financial services 
because of strict Federal laws and regulations that prohibit 
them from offering services to cannabis businesses.
    Banking regulators can permanently ban someone from working 
in a bank or revoke an institution's FDIC coverage for working 
with cannabis businesses, and this endangers the lives and 
livelihoods of Colorado business owners who have to operate in 
this kind of a situation. They have nowhere to put their cash.
    Last weekend, Signature Bank failed. The other bank that 
failed, Silicon Valley Bank--here is what they had to do to 
fail. They had to not observe the fact that their balance sheet 
had basically tripled over some period of time; not observe the 
fact that they were in a volatile high-tech industry where the 
tide comes in and goes out for all those tech companies at 
exactly the same time, which is what we are seeing today.
    They had to make a decision to lay on 10-year paper with 
ridiculously low interest rates, compared to the interest rates 
that are about to be changed by the Fed. I can tell you, unless 
somebody around here knows something I do not know, Jay Powell 
was not exactly secretive about what he was doing with them.
    They had to get that through their board, they had to get 
that through that audit committee, and somehow they had to get 
that through a regulator, I guess, who was looking over that, 
who was not saying it was insane what they were doing.
    We have had all week--it has been it's Dodd-Frank, not 
Dodd-Frank; 2018, not 2018. I do not know what the answer is 
going to be about any of that, but I know that what they were 
doing was not prudentially sound, and I hope that the regulator 
would be the backstop.
    I am 30 seconds over, so I will stop, to go back to my 
marijuana question. Last weekend, Signature Bank failed, and 
almost a fifth of its deposits came from crypto. Like they are 
not allowed to do anything with marijuana, but apparently they 
can lay 20 percent of this on crypto, a notoriously unstable 
thing that nobody here even understands, and where the value of 
the assets can soar and collapse. We have seen that in this 
sector.
    And my question is, what questions come to your mind when 
you see that, when you have a bank that has now failed, where 
20 percent of what it was relying on to claim that it was doing 
the right thing by its depositors was something, I would argue, 
is not even as stable as the marijuana industry in the State of 
Colorado, which cannot get any approval from the Treasury 
Department?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, as you pointed out, in the case of 
marijuana, it is against Federal law, and that is a barrier, 
unfortunately, to appropriate banking services for the 
industry. It is something the regulators have been looking for 
solutions to.
    I think we need to look into what the regulators do, 
exactly what happened to create the problems that these two 
banks that failed faced, and make sure that our regulatory 
system and supervision is appropriately geared so that banks 
manage their risks to avoid problems of the type that these 
banks have suffered from.
    The Chairman. Senator Bennet, thank you, and thank you for 
always being there to point out when numbers do not add up, 
because that is exactly what the Budget chairman, who is a 
member of this committee, Senator Whitehouse, just found a 
couple of days ago with respect to the health of the republic.
    Senator Warner is next.
    Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Madam 
Secretary, it is great to see you, and let me commend my dear 
friend from Colorado. I have always noticed, Senator Bennet, 
what you do, and I think you raised great issues. I think about 
one of the first gangs that you and Senator Crapo and I and 
others were on: Simpson-Bowles. It wasn't perfect, but man, we 
would be a heck of a lot further down the path if we had taken 
that.
    Let me also mention--I want to talk about something I think 
has not been raised on the banking issue, and I want to join a 
lot of my colleagues. I think you, the Fed, the FDIC moved very 
aggressively. I think the potential downside risk for 
businesses across the country, for other medium-sized banks 
across the industry, could have been a disaster.
    I think the actions you took were bold. You stepped up and 
shored up the system. I am of the belief that--echoing what 
Senator Bennet said--traditional prudential regulation should 
have caught this. Where was the bank management, where were the 
regulators--both State and Federal--in the case of SVB? They 
should have got this interest rate mismatch caught much, much 
earlier.
    But the one thing, though, that I worry about, whatever 
regulatory system we had in place, the other half of what 
happened happened sometime between Tuesday and Thursday 
afternoon, where we have seen now the very first social media/
Internet-based bank run. To put this in any kind of comparison, 
when WaMu failed, the largest bank failure in our country's 
history, $16 billion came out over a 10-day period.
    I am not sure what regulatory system anywhere, no matter 
how much capital, no matter how many stress tests, would have 
protected any institution from a $42-billion bank run in a 
single day. That literally, at that point, was 25 cents on the 
dollar of every dollar that was deposited.
    You know, I think most of us have seen ``It's a Wonderful 
Life.'' We realize that that money was off in small businesses 
and start-up businesses around the country. The question I have 
is, who was playing the role of Mr. Potter? I think there were 
some--and listen, I have been supportive of the venture capital 
community. I was a venture capitalist before.
    But I think there were some bad actors in the VC community, 
who literally started to spur this run by virtually crying 
``fire'' in a crowded theater in terms of rushing all of these 
deposits out. I am not sure that we have anything in our 
existing regulatory structure, and I do not--and it is early 
on, and we need to figure out what happened and who missed 
this.
    But this notion that, you know, 25 cents on every dollar 
can rush out in a single day and the people who spurred this 
online Tuesday and Wednesday night bear no responsibility--the 
hypocrisy of some who are Libertarian until the stuff hits the 
fan and then want relief is frankly more than a little 
repugnant.
    So early on--this is not normally within the traditional 
banking regulation, but I think this will go down as history's 
first Internet-driven run. Do you have any initial thoughts on 
this?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, you know, no matter how strong 
capital and liquidity supervision are, if a bank has an 
overwhelming run that is spurred by social media or whatever, 
so that it is seeing deposits flee at that pace, a bank can be 
put in danger of failing. Of course, there is backup liquidity, 
there is the Fed's discount window.
    But this really can be a threat to banks, and one of the 
reasons we intervened and declared a systemic risk exception is 
because of the recognition there can be contagion in situations 
like this, and other banks can then fall prey to the same kinds 
of runs, which we certainly want to avoid.
    But this was a bank that had a very high ratio of uninsured 
depositors. Insured depositors and retail customers usually do 
not run. We tend not to see runs among insured depositors. But 
the liquidity requirements and needs of a bank with such heavy 
reliance on uninsured deposits that are runnable, I think we 
need to think about that.
    Senator Warner. And I agree--and a complete concentration 
in an industry sector. But the notion--and again, I do not have 
a solution in mind yet--but the idea that there is no 
responsibility for the equivalent of shouting ``fire'' in a 
crowded theater and forcing that run, using technology as a 
mechanism to accelerate that, you know, presents a problem that 
I think, I hope we could all kind of put our heads jointly 
together on.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    Our next three would be Senator Thune, Senator Lankford, 
and Senator Cortez Masto.
    Senator Thune?
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary, 
thank you for being here.
    Madam Secretary, would you characterize the pandemic as 
being over?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, I think we are still living with 
COVID. Its impact on America has diminished, but it still 
certainly exists, and it is affecting the economy.
    Senator Thune. I think for all practical purposes--you 
know, most people acknowledge, yes, there is some overhang, but 
that it is over. So, just out of curiosity, how much of your 
workforce is back in the office?
    Secretary Yellen. We are basically back to business as 
usual, although we have policies that enable a certain amount 
of work from home, as most companies and offices do. It is a 
practical and efficient way to conduct business these days.
    Senator Thune. There are some things for which that may be 
true--and this is not directly your purview. Maybe it is a 
better question for the banking regulators. But I would be 
curious to know how much of their workforce is actually back in 
the office and functioning, because it seems to me that from a 
supervisory standpoint, if your job is to examine banks, that 
is something that you kind of have to be there to do.
    And it seems to me at least--and your agency as recently as 
when we were talking about the Inflation Reduction Act back in 
August, my understanding at that time was that less than half 
were back in the office. If that is up, I would like to know 
what the updated number is on that.
    Let me ask you: will you commit to keeping this committee 
apprised of the Treasury's findings when it comes to SVB, what 
you find there, in a timely and thorough manner?
    Secretary Yellen. We certainly will keep this committee 
updated. However, much of the investigation of what happened at 
this bank would be done by the FDIC, and so that is an 
appropriate source of information.
    Senator Thune. And we will make sure we ask them that same 
question. But I know that you will be involved. I mean, this 
obviously is something that, you know, dramatically impacts the 
economy and would be something significantly of interest, I 
would think, to the Treasury Department.
    And hopefully, you will stick to that commitment. In a 
previous Finance Committee hearing, you gave your ``absolute 
word'' to keep us updated on Treasury's findings about the 
private taxpayer data that was improperly shared from the IRS 
to ProPublica. It has been almost 2 years since that breach of 
taxpayer data was made public, and the administration still, 
still has not provided a meaningful response.
    And you can answer that, but let me move on here. I want to 
ask a question about the actions taken by the administration to 
shore up Silicon Valley Bank and others. Treasury issued a 
joint statement that stated, and I quote: ``No losses will be 
borne by the taxpayer.'' Do you stand by that statement?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes.
    Senator Thune. And I just want to stress this is something 
that is deeply important to taxpayers, and I think it is 
something that I--and I expect a lot of my colleagues, 
hopefully on both sides of the aisle--will be strictly holding 
this administration to account on.
    You, in the IRA, got an additional $80 billion, six times 
the annual budget of the IRS--I should say, not directly 
Treasury but the IRS--and 87,000 new employees. Now the request 
in this year's budget, because that is what we are talking 
about here today, is for an additional 15-percent increase, 
somewhere on the order of $29 or $30 billion additional.
    We still do not have the plan for the $80 billion in IRS 
funding, and there was supposed to be a plan made public 
several weeks ago. So, could you speak to when we might see a 
plan, since there is a request now for additional funding above 
and beyond what was a massive, historic amount of funding in 
the IRA?
    Secretary Yellen. So, the plan is almost complete, and you 
should have it in the near future.
    Senator Thune. And what does that mean, ``near future''?
    Secretary Yellen. In a matter of weeks.
    Senator Thune. Okay; all right. I hope that you can follow 
through on that. And let me just ask, with respect to the use 
of that $80 billion. Some of it, I know, was supposed to be 
funneled towards taxpayer services, which I hope is the case, 
because the IRS has had a deplorable record of getting back to 
taxpayers, a 13-percent phone call return rate.
    How much of that $80 billion is going to be directed to 
enforcement, and does the Treasury expect that any of that 
revenue is going to come from increased audits of middle-class 
taxpayers?
    Secretary Yellen. The President and I have committed that 
there will be no increase in audit rates on individuals or 
small businesses under $400,000, and I stand by that pledge. I 
have issued a directive to IRS to that effect. Most of the 
hiring, the large numbers that are seen, are replacement of 
people who are retiring.
    But there will be additional hiring, both of customer 
service representatives--5,000 more were hired this season, and 
the response rate has gone from the 13 percent you mentioned to 
around 85 percent this tax season. We want to keep it at that 
level and add other things that will make filing and 
interacting with the IRS more convenient for both individuals 
and for businesses.
    But an important goal is greater enforcement, hiring of 
skilled tax lawyers and auditors and accountants, to deal with 
high-
income and high-net-worth individuals, complex partnerships, 
and corporations where we think most of the tax gap is 
centered.
    And so, although $80 billion over 10 years sounds like a 
huge investment, it is one with an enormous payoff that will 
substantially lower the budget deficit, because we have a huge 
tax gap that needs to be addressed.
    The Chairman. Your time, my friend, has expired. We are 
going to push very hard to get every Finance member a chance to 
ask their questions before we go. Next will be Senator 
Lankford, then Senator Cortez Masto. We have the Secretary 
until 1:00.
    Senator Lankford?
    Senator Lankford. Thank you.
    Madam Secretary, thanks for being here. There are a lot of 
things that I want to be able to talk about on this. We have 
some tax proposals on the table. I have a bipartisan charitable 
act dealing with tax policy that we are not going to have time 
to be able to talk to you about.
    I would like to be able to talk about full expensing. 
Senator Toomey used to be able to champion this, but it is a 
big issue for our manufacturers in my State and all around the 
country. I would love to get a chance to talk about that.
    I would love to talk about marriage penalties in the tax 
code, because, quite frankly, they are still there. That is one 
of the things we have got to be able to work on. Energy 
independence--I did notice a whole new set of new taxes on 
energy companies in the United States that I think would hurt 
our energy independence.
    And there is still no definition for the $600--if you do 
Venmo payments to somebody up to $600, now the IRS is going to 
track you. I have noticed that you have delayed that, and the 
IRS has delayed that. But there are a lot of questions with 
that, and new, creative definitions of what it means to be made 
in America.
    We now have new treaties that are popping up that are not 
really treaties, not really free trade agreements, but they are 
being declared free trade agreements to allow--from the 
Inflation Reduction Act--actions from Japan and Germany to now 
be defined as made in America. I find that very creative. I 
would love to talk about all of that.
    I do not have time; I need to be able to drill down on a 
couple of things. Let me start with some of the banking issues 
we are dealing with on that. Will the deposits in every 
community bank in Oklahoma, regardless of their size, be fully 
insured now? Are they fully covered, every bank, every 
community bank in Oklahoma, regardless of the size of the 
deposit?
    Will they get the same treatment that SVB just got, or 
Signature Bank just got?
    Secretary Yellen. A bank only gets that treatment if a 
majority of the FDIC board, a super-majority, and a super-
majority of the Fed board and I, in consultation with the 
President, determine that the failure to protect uninsured 
depositors would create systemic risk and significant economic 
and financial consequences.
    Senator Lankford. So, what is your plan----
    Secretary Yellen. I make that determination----
    Senator Lankford. Right. So, what is your plan to keep 
large depositors from moving their funds out of community banks 
into the big banks? We have seen the mergers of banks over the 
past decade. I am concerned you are about to accelerate that by 
encouraging anyone who has a large deposit in a community bank 
to say, ``We are not going to make you whole, but if you go to 
one of our preferred banks, we will make you whole at that 
point.''
    Secretary Yellen. I mean, we are--that is certainly not 
something that we are encouraging.
    Senator Lankford. That is happening right now.
    Secretary Yellen. That is happening because depositors are 
concerned about the bank failures that have happened, and 
whether or not other banks could also fail.
    Senator Lankford. No, it is happening because you are fully 
insured no matter what the amount is if you are in a big bank. 
You are not fully insured if you are in a community bank.
    Secretary Yellen. Well, you are not fully insured----
    Senator Lankford. You were at Signature, and it just barely 
met the threshold. You were at Signature.
    Secretary Yellen. Well, we felt that there was a serious 
risk of contagion that could have brought down and triggered 
runs on many banks, and that something--given that our judgment 
is that the banking system overall is safe and sound, 
depositors should have confidence in the system, we took these 
actions to discourage contagion.
    Senator Lankford. So, there is a special assessment that 
has been done on community banks in my State and all banks 
across the country. Was there any discussion that that special 
assessment would only apply to the larger banks, or was it 
always assumed the special assessment would cover every bank, 
including rural banks in my State?
    Secretary Yellen. I think--I am not certain what the rules 
are around that. That is up to the FDIC to determine.
    Senator Lankford. It has been reported publicly that SVB 
had a large number of Chinese investors that are there, 
including some that were companies directly connected to the 
Chinese Communist Party. Will those individuals, companies, 
entities, and investors that are Chinese investors be made 
whole based on assessments of my banks in Oklahoma?
    So, what I am asking is, will my banks in Oklahoma pay a 
special assessment to be able to make Chinese investors whole 
from Silicon Valley Bank?
    Secretary Yellen. Uninsured investors will be made whole in 
that bank, and I suppose that could include foreign depositors. 
But I do not believe there is any legal basis to discriminate 
among the uninsured.
    Senator Lankford. I get it, but I am just saying my 
community banks are going to pay this additional fee. It is 
always fascinating to me as well the conversation that 
taxpayers are being made whole, and that the taxpayers are not 
going to have any kind of consequence in this. I am sure my 
bankers are going to be very excited to know they no longer pay 
taxes, and their banks no longer pay taxes.
    Credit unions do not pay taxes; banks do. So they are 
definitely taxpayers as well, and all banks make their revenue 
off of rates and fees and such to their account holders, which 
means every Oklahoman will pay higher fees in their community 
banks.
    The Chairman. We are just going to have to move on.
    Secretary Yellen. If we have a collapse of the banking 
system and its economic consequences, that will have very 
severe effects on banks in Oklahoma that will also be 
threatened----
    Senator Lankford. I am just worried about the--I am just 
worried about the long-term consequences on our banks----
    The Chairman. We are going to have to move on, or we are 
not going to get all Senators in.
    Senator Cortez Masto?
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary 
Yellen, it is always good to see you. Thank you.
    Secretary Yellen. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Cortez Masto. But before we get to the banking and 
the budget, let me ask you something that is important in my 
State, and I think across the country, quite honestly. These 
are the low-income solar tax credits, and it is a question that 
I asked Commissioner Werfel regarding section 13103 of the 
Inflation Reduction Act, which provides a bonus investment tax 
credit for certain renewable energy investments that were made 
in low-income communities.
    The February guidance that Treasury put out provides that 
potential applications will only be considered for this tax 
credit during limited application windows, and this limit--this 
is my concern--will limit solar deployment and the ability to 
drive clean energy investment in these communities, because the 
investments with tax credits happen when you have certainty up 
front that the credit can be used.
    It is especially important because the law requires that 
the bonus credit that we put in the Inflation Reduction Act be 
tied directly towards reductions in energy bills for consumers. 
So, in light of these challenges and headwinds facing the solar 
industry--and I am going to talk a little bit about that as 
well--can you share anything regarding the process for revising 
the guidance in the very near future, to meet the intent of 
Congress--not only here with the solar tax credit, to ensure 
that people can access it in a timely way before it goes away, 
but the guidance in general that you have talked about?
    Because everybody is waiting for guidance to be 
implementing the Inflation Reduction Act proposals we put in 
there, and there is concern they are going to come too late 
before we can even utilize the opportunities.
    Secretary Yellen. All I can say is that we are working 24-7 
on the guidance and regulations that need to be written in 
order to implement the various tax credits that are in the IRA. 
We have no higher priority at Treasury, and we are really 
working tirelessly to get this done.
    My understanding is that we have committed to open the 
first phase of applications for this credit in the third 
quarter of this year, and we will provide detailed guidance 
ahead of accepting applications.
    Senator Cortez Masto. So, let me put a proposal out there, 
and this is for some of my colleagues as well, because I think 
in general the Inflation Reduction Act and the work that we 
have been doing to lead us into this clean energy future 
requires a bridge to get us there.
    And let me just say this. I support the manufacturing here 
in this country, and we need to build it and grow it. But when 
it comes to solar, we are not there yet. I support the 
manufacturing that is happening in Ohio and here across this 
country. But the manufacturing for the supplies that we need to 
grow out solar in this country only has a capacity of 5.6 
gigawatts.
    Now let me just say in 2022, we were able to actually 
install--the demand was for 20.2 gigawatts. So, we are at a 
deficit there, and if we do not get these supplies, if we do 
not have what we need to address bringing these supplies here 
from somewhere and deal with the tariffs that are out there 
that are limiting our access to these supplies, we are going to 
be limited in the amount that we can grow our clean energy in 
this country through solar.
    So that is what I would love the administration to keep in 
mind, my colleagues as well, that yes, we want to make sure 
that we are getting our supplies from countries that we 
support, that are our friends, that are our partners--
absolutely. But until we grow our domestic manufacturing here, 
we are not going to meet the demand for solar in this country 
that we need right now.
    Secretary Yellen. Well, there are substantial incentives in 
this legislation to bring manufacturing of solar panels to the 
United States, and we are certainly picking up great interest 
among investors in moving manufacturing here. We are trying to 
get at the regulations as rapidly as we possibly can, to make 
sure that we provide the certainty that is needed for those 
investors.
    But there are big incentives in this package to do just 
that, and we are excited to see what is happening----
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, and I do not mean to cut 
you off. I only have so much time. Let me just talk about the 
budget really quickly, what I see here. Is it true that the 
Federal deficit has been reduced by over $1.7 trillion just in 
the last 2 years?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes, that is true.
    Senator Cortez Masto. And it is also true what you said 
earlier that this budget proposed by this administration looks 
at also an additional deficit reduction of $3 trillion over 10 
years?
    Secretary Yellen. That is correct.
    Senator Cortez Masto. So, this administration is concerned 
about reducing the deficit; correct?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. And the debt limit that we are 
talking about, everybody is talking about, that debt limit--let 
us be fair; let us talk in a bipartisan way--that debt was 
incurred by both previous Republican and Democratic 
administrations; correct?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes; we are talking about paying bills 
for spending that the Congress has authorized.
    Senator Cortez Masto. I appreciate that; thank you.
    I know I am over my time. I will submit the rest of my 
questions for the record. Thank you, Madam Secretary.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague, and I will just say, 
during the 10-year odyssey of developing those clean energy tax 
credits, it was always our intent to have the bonus solar tax 
credit for low-income communities. So, we will continue to work 
with my colleague.
    Senator Warren?
    Senator Warren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    So, on Friday, the United States faced the second biggest 
bank failure in our entire history, and as panic spread among 
small businesses and nonprofits that had money deposited with 
Silicon Valley Bank, Treasury and other financial regulators 
announced they would take emergency measures to stabilize the 
system.
    I am grateful for the administration's steady hand, but we 
should not have had to be here in the first place. These bank 
failures were the direct result of policymakers' decisions over 
the last 5 years, beginning with a 2018 law signed by President 
Trump with the support of both parties, to weaken the 
regulations that had been put in place after the 2008 financial 
crisis to ensure that big banks never again crashed our 
economy.
    On Monday, President Biden called on Congress and 
regulators to ``strengthen the rules for banks to make it less 
likely that this kind of bank failure will happen again.'' 
Secretary Yellen, thank you for being here today. Do you agree 
with the President, that we need to strengthen our banking 
rules?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, I think we certainly need to 
analyze carefully what happened that triggered these bank 
failures, and reexamine our rules and supervision, and make 
sure that they are appropriate to address the risk that banks 
face.
    Senator Warren. Okay. So, we want to make sure we have the 
right rules in place, and pretty obviously, we need some 
stronger rules here. So I want to talk about those rules, the 
stress tests. Stress tests are critical tools in the regulatory 
toolbox that are designed to expose banks' vulnerabilities if 
bad things happen and force the banks to shore up any weak 
points before it is too late.
    Now, Secretary Yellen, when you were implementing the Dodd-
Frank regulations as Fed chair 6 years ago back in 2017, you 
said, ``Our stress testing regime is forcing banks to greatly 
improve their risk management and capital planning.'' But you 
warned that because ``we can never be confident that there will 
not be another financial crisis, it is important that we 
maintain the improvements that have been put in place that 
mitigate the risk and the potential damage.''
    So I want to talk about those stress tests that you talked 
about, how important they were 6 years ago. Secretary Yellen, 
can regular, rigorous, well-designed stress tests help bank 
regulators spot problems lurking in banks' balance sheets and 
business models?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes. I continue to endorse the comments 
that you quoted.
    Senator Warren. Good.
    Secretary Yellen. I think this has been one of the most 
important and consequential improvements in supervision since 
the financial crisis.
    Senator Warren. Okay; so two thumbs up for stress tests. 
Let me just ask: when regulators spot these problems early on, 
can those regulators then require the banks to clean up the 
problems long before they trigger a run on the bank?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes, and in that sense, they are useful. 
But I would like to make one point----
    Senator Warren. Sure.
    Secretary Yellen [continuing]. Which is that the 
supervisory stress tests focus on capital, and not on 
liquidity, and in these bank failures liquidity played an 
important role.
    Senator Warren. Well, let us ask the question then all the 
way around. If stress tests are done right, if we have robust 
stress tests the way you described 6 years ago when you were 
still running the Fed, do they just test one thing that might 
go wrong, or do they test for lots of different problems if 
they are done right?
    Secretary Yellen. If they are done right, they test for 
many possible problems, but they do not focus on liquidity----
    Senator Warren. Okay, but they test for many kinds of 
things that go wrong, is that right, potentially?
    Secretary Yellen. There are different scenarios every year 
and----
    Senator Warren. So, let me ask you then a related question. 
Is one of the problems that stress tests can expose that you 
have managers who are not very good at managing risk, or 
management that is otherwise doing a bad job that could put a 
bank in jeopardy?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, that is the purpose of supervision, 
and stress tests are one tool. Supervision is another tool that 
is critical.
    Senator Warren. Okay; so, very important. We have stress 
tests, we have supervision, we have a lot of pieces here to 
make this work. In 2018 though, Trump's bank deregulation law 
and the door it opened for Fed Chair Powell to further hack 
away at the rules created an exception to annual Fed-
administered stress tests, letting banks from $50 billion to 
$250 billion effectively off the hook.
    And that meant that a bank like SVB, which had $209 billion 
in assets when it failed, would be exempt from annual stress 
testing. So the question I have here is, if the law had not--
let us not just do stress tests. It is stress tests; it is the 
whole package: enhanced liquidity requirements that ensure that 
banks have enough cash on hand to meet their obligations, 
particularly in times of stress; capital requirements that 
better position banks to absorb losses; regular resolution 
plans to help guide regulators safely through winding down 
failed banks.
    All of these were weakened in 2018, and when SVB failed, 
this is a part, in my view, of the Fed's actions that led to 
weaker regulation. You know, over the last few days, we have 
heard a lot of Republicans say that this collapse was not their 
fault; it was the banking regulators who were asleep at the 
wheel.
    Believe me, I have questions for a lot of the banking 
regulators. But Congress handed Chair Powell the flame thrower 
that he aimed at the banking rules. In fact, he said so 
himself. I will quote and then I will quit. When he announced 
that he was weakening regulations for the banks like SVB, Chair 
Powell said, and I quote: ``In the rules before us, we are 
applying the discretion granted to us by the Economic Growth 
Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act.''
    Translation: ``Congress opened the door to weaker 
regulations, and I am waltzing right through it.'' That is 
true. Congress needs to close that door.
    I am sorry, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. My colleague has great experience in this, 
and I apologize for having to cut people off.
    Senator Johnson is next.
    Senator Johnson. Did you call on me? Okay; thank you, Mr. 
Chairman. Welcome, Secretary Yellen.
    I just want to start--do you know how much a dollar that 
you held at the start of the Biden administration in January 
2021 is worth today?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, we have had inflation, and it has 
declined in its purchasing power.
    Senator Johnson. It is worth 87 cents. In your testimony, 
you said that inflation is the number one economic problem. Do 
you know what the inflation rate was at the start of the Biden 
administration in January 2021?
    Secretary Yellen. It was substantially lower.
    Senator Johnson. It was 1.4 percent. You said that 
inflation has many causes. I agree with that. By the way, I 
would say that the number one economic problem is our debt and 
deficit, and I would say that the top three causes of inflation 
are massive deficit spending; the war on fossil fuels, which 
has driven energy, gasoline prices to record levels; and 
obviously supply chain dislocation. That was caused by our 
miserably failed and incredibly stupid response to COVID, the 
pandemic. But would you agree those are the top three causes of 
inflation: deficit spending, high energy costs, and supply 
dislocations?
    Secretary Yellen. I do not believe that deficit spending is 
one of the main causes of inflation.
    Senator Johnson. You do not? I mean, inflation is too many 
dollars chasing too few goods. So when you are printing all 
this--so do you know in the first 3 fiscal years of the Biden 
administration, do you know how much the total deficit spending 
is going to be?
    Secretary Yellen. We had an economic collapse that was 
caused by the pandemic.
    Senator Johnson. Right, and we were certainly coming out of 
that, because there was all this pent-up demand and the 
sloshing around of trillions of dollars. So I will answer that 
question for you too. The first 3 fiscal years of this 
administration, the total deficits would be about $5.7 
trillion.
    So now you are here testifying before the committee about 
the President's budget. How much are the total deficits over 
that 10-year period, according to the President's budget? 
[Pause.]
    Senator Johnson. You do not know that off the top of your 
head? I am running out of time--it is $17 trillion, okay?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes, that is right.
    Senator Johnson. You are going to drive the debt from 
somewhere around $32 trillion up to about $50 trillion; 
correct?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes, but what I believe is the single 
most important metric for judging the fiscal stance of the 
country is real net interest as a share of GDP. We have----
    Senator Johnson. Okay. So, are you concerned when you take 
the debt from $32 to $50 trillion, are you concerned who is 
going to buy that debt? And also, at what rate will they expect 
to be compensated for buying riskier and riskier debt? Are you 
concerned about that?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, if the net interest, real net 
interest cost of the debt remains low relative to GDP, and we 
are on this sustainable fiscal----
    Senator Johnson. But we are not, we are not on a 
sustainable path.
    Senator Cassidy was talking about the President's 
demagoguery on Social Security, his unwillingness to meet to 
try and save Social Security. If we do nothing and the Social 
Security trust fund runs out in 2023 to 2025, at the end of the 
budget period, are you concerned that we are not going to have 
the financial wherewithal to plus up benefits to honor those 
promises?
    I mean, do you think we are going to--with $50 trillion in 
debt, you know, a debt exceeding our GDP, are you not concerned 
about our inability to honor those promises?
    Secretary Yellen. The interest cost on the debt as a share 
of our economy remains quite low throughout the 10-year horizon 
of the President's budget. It remains around 1.6 percent, and 
that is very manageable.
    Senator Johnson. Madam Secretary, you were also the one who 
said that inflation was transitory, and it certainly is not. I 
think Chairman Powell certainly now agrees with the fact that 
no, we have got something going on here that is going to take a 
very long while, unfortunately, to wring out of our system.
    Not only you, but OMB Director Young and members on the 
other side keep talking about how you are cutting deficits. The 
deficit in 2021 obviously was high because of the pandemic. In 
2022, it was about $1.4 trillion. In 2023, we think it is going 
to be about $1.6 trillion. In 2024, you are projecting $1.85 
trillion, and again growing debt by--it never drops below $1.5 
trillion. How can you claim that you are cutting deficits?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, it always is a comparison with the 
baseline of what would happen if our policies were not enacted, 
and the increase in deficits would be larger. There is net 
deficit reduction over 10 years.
    Senator Johnson. But saying you are cutting the deficit is 
just misleading the American public.
    Let me ask you one final question, because we always hear 
on the other side--the same thing from OMB Director Young 
yesterday--that we want to make the rich pay their fair share.
    So I mean, the fact is--and these are the latest figures we 
have from the Treasury: in 2020, the top 1 percent made about 
22 percent of income, but they paid 42.3 percent of income tax. 
Now I just--I am not going to ask you the metric.
    At what point--I mean, how much of the total income tax 
should the top 1 percent pay before you will consider, before 
President Biden will consider, they are finally paying their 
fair share? I mean, they are paying double the income tax that 
they are getting in income.
    It is an obviously highly progressive rate. By the way, the 
bottom----
    The Chairman. My colleague is over his time, and I want the 
witness to answer his question.
    Secretary Yellen. Well, I believe that billionaires should 
pay rates that are not lower than what a teacher or firefighter 
pays.
    Senator Johnson. Okay, the top 1 percent averages----
    The Chairman. The time of the gentleman has expired.
    Senator Tillis is next.
    Senator Johnson. Well, my colleague got 7 minutes. The top 
1 percent paid----
    The Chairman. The time of the gentleman has expired----
    Senator Johnson. The bottom 50 percent paid 3.1. We have a 
highly progressive tax system.
    The Chairman. Senator Tillis, you are next.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Madam Secretary, just really quickly on this question. The 
President's budget, I think, assumes 4.3 percent of inflation 
through Calendar Year 2023.
    Number one, can you confirm that or give me an accurate 
number if I am wrong, and just describe for me how do we do 
that, particularly in light of what has happened with SVB and 
when I think we will continue to see monetary policy that is 
going to increase incrementally until we get inflation under 
control.
    That creates other stressors for the banking community, but 
is it 4.3 percent, and do you agree with that assumption?
    Secretary Yellen. Did you say inflation?
    Senator Tillis. Yes, inflation for Calendar Year 2023.
    Secretary Yellen. For 2023, we assume that inflation would 
run at 3 percent.
    Senator Tillis. At 3 percent, and we are in the tail end of 
March. So you still believe, given the inflation estimates we 
got, that that is still a valid assumption?
    Secretary Yellen. It is coming down on a 12-month basis 
and----
    Senator Tillis. Yes; okay. If you could just get to the 
committee the analysis that went into that, I think it would be 
helpful.
    I want to go back to Senator Warren's comments very 
quickly. Back in 2017, I think you were quoted before the Joint 
Economic Committee with respect to Senate bill 2155 that ``the 
Fed would still be able to impose enhanced prudential standards 
on firms if necessary, and that the bill is a move in the right 
direction. That would be a good enabling for the Fed to 
appropriately tailor its supervision.'' Do you still stand by 
that statement?
    Secretary Yellen. I think that tailoring--I said that I 
thought tailoring is appropriate, and I still believe that.
    Senator Tillis. Okay.
    Secretary Yellen. And I think the Fed continues to have at 
least some discretion----
    Senator Tillis. I guess the question that I have, because I 
do not agree with Senator Warren, the premise of her questions. 
It seems to me unless we--oh, and I should say that in that 
same time frame, Mr. Tarullo was responsible for implementing a 
bill that he publicly criticized, Senate bill 2155. He did not 
like the bill. He is over there helping implement it, and 
yesterday----
    Secretary Yellen. Wasn't it passed in 2018? He left----
    Senator Tillis. No, no, I am sorry. When you were 
implementing Dodd-Frank. I am sorry. When you were implementing 
Dodd-Frank, Tarullo was in play. Then we passed Senate bill 
2155. He was highly critical of it.
    However, he said, as late as yesterday, he does not believe 
that Senate bill 2155 had anything to do with what occurred at 
Silicon Valley Bank, and that his suspicion was that it was 
maybe supervisors not being aggressive and potentially using 
some of the discretionary regulatory regimens that were allowed 
in Senate bill 2155, if you happen to have a specific bank that 
had activities where you should increase the level of 
supervision. So it seems to me that here, we are using 2155 as 
a red herring for something that I believe, fundamentally, is 
going to be a supervisory or regulatory lapse.
    I want to ask a question about OECD in my time remaining, 
and I do want to get close to 5 minutes. The baseline agreement 
does not have what I consider to be the most basic standards 
for dispute resolution, but it looks as if we still want to 
move forward with congressional action absent that.
    I also have some concerns with the exemptions that are in 
the agreement, particularly with respect to China, and I am 
grossly summarizing my context to give you a chance to respond. 
But let me tell you, even beyond the exceptions that benefit 
China and state-owned enterprises, neither this committee nor 
the Committee on Taxation has received the data and analysis 
that you all used as a basis for negotiating the deal.
    Can I just simply get a commitment that the Joint Committee 
on Taxation and that this committee will get that data and 
analysis as a part of our future consideration for the 
provision that has to come before Congress?
    Secretary Yellen. I am sorry. I am not sure if you are 
talking about Pillar 2 or Pillar 1.
    Senator Tillis. I think it is all of the above, to the 
extent that they are both in the agreement.
    Secretary Yellen. Well, I think the analysis on Pillar 2 
has been done. Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe the 
Joint Committee on Taxation has looked at that, and we have 
provided estimates as well that have used standard methods, and 
I can discuss that with you----
    Senator Tillis. We will submit----
    Secretary Yellen. On Pillar 2, we have had----
    Senator Tillis. We will submit a question for the record. 
My time has expired. We will submit a question for the record 
to fully describe exactly what we are looking for. And, to the 
extent that it is possessed by some members, then I will 
stipulate that I was wrong. But I am going in with a little bit 
of a skeptical position.
    Thank you.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague for his courtesy, and we 
will have the staff, the Finance staff, share what we have on 
Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 with my colleague.
    Senator Blackburn is next.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam 
Secretary, thank you for being with us today.
    I want to return to the SVB issue and ask you--I have not 
heard you say today, when were you first notified that there 
were problems with SVB, and when did you alert members of 
Congress? What was that timeline?
    Secretary Yellen. I believe that I first found out about 
the troubles at Silicon Valley Bank, I guess it was last 
Thursday.
    Senator Blackburn. Last Thursday, and then your 
notification to Congress came when?
    Secretary Yellen. The bank was put in----
    Senator Blackburn. Why don't you just put that in writing 
for me, so I do not waste my time?
    I know Senator Lankford asked you about the Deposit 
Insurance Fund, and how that would affect our local banks. 
There is a lot of concern over this, and I know you were 
uncertain about that.
    If you would, run the numbers on that and let us know a 
ballpark of what you think this would cost if you end up 
insuring everybody's deposit. And then I have to ask you, being 
from Tennessee--you know, we have a long and storied history of 
opposing nationalizing the banking system. Do you see this as a 
step to nationalize the banking system?
    Secretary Yellen. Absolutely not. I think this is a step 
toward stemming contagion that could come from the failure of 
these banks that would place community banks across the country 
at great risk of runs, as well that we want to----
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, ma'am.
    Let me move to the Inflation Reduction Act and that 
implementation. I hear a lot about this from local Mayors and 
our State agencies. There is a lot of money that can be doled 
out. Treasury and other agencies are going to be required to 
issue guidance. That has not come, and so there is a lot of 
confusion there, and I was looking at the structure.
    I want to make certain that I am viewing this right. We 
have you, the Deputy Secretary, the Office of IRA 
Implementation within Treasury, the Office of IRA 
Implementation in the IRS, and Danny Werfel, who is the new, 
recently confirmed IRS Commissioner. So, with all of these 
bodies involved, who is actually in charge? Who is the final 
decision-maker on the guidance and the timeline for releasing 
that guidance?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, our Office of Tax Policy drafts 
regulations----
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. So, you----
    Secretary Yellen [continuing]. And we go through a regular 
rulemaking.
    Senator Blackburn. Then do you sign off on it? Are you the 
final say?
    Secretary Yellen. I do, I do.
    Senator Blackburn. So you are the one who has the final 
say.
    Secretary Yellen. I do sign off on it. We confer with many, 
many people in the process of drafting that, and it will go 
through full comment and review before final----
    Senator Blackburn. All right.
    Let me ask you something else, because the buck stops with 
you. You have really praised the IRA. I want to ask you one 
more thing about that, because your statements contradict 
themselves somewhat. You talk about the IRA as a way to really 
bring prosperity, to lower inflation, to lower the debt.
    So, do you really believe that we can spend our way to 
lower inflation, to debt reduction, and to economic prosperity?
    Secretary Yellen. I believe that this law promotes clean 
energy and R&D and investment in the United States that will--
--
    Senator Blackburn. But that is not my question. Do you 
believe we can spend our way to lower inflation? And I am going 
to move on, obviously.
    Secretary Yellen. I have never said any such--I have never 
said that I think that that is a way to lower inflation.
    Senator Blackburn. All right. Thank you, ma'am.
    You have mentioned the IRS being able to answer more phone 
calls and respond more quickly because of the IRA funding. I 
was looking at the IRS data, and it shows that the IRS actually 
answered 2.6 million fewer calls this March during the tax 
filing season. And I know Senator Thune asked you about this.
    If we could get some clarity from you and from your 
testimony about this--what is the rate, how often are these 
calls answered and missed, what percentage of people at the IRS 
are still working remotely, and what is your timeline for 
bringing them all back?
    Secretary Yellen. What I can tell you is that the response 
rate to customer calls has been between 80 and 90 percent every 
week during this tax filing season, and that is a massive 
improvement. The IRS hired 5,000 new people to put into 
customer service, and that relied on funds from the IRA.
    Senator Blackburn. My time has expired, but in the 8 
quarters data that the IRS gave in early March, the IRS says 
they actually answered 2.6 million fewer calls in this tax 
filing season.
    Secretary Yellen. Well, there may have been fewer calls, 
but the rate of response was very much higher, substantially 
higher.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Madam Secretary.
    The Chairman. Thank you. We do need to move on.
    Senator Menendez?
    Senator Menendez. The Federal Reserve's emergency lending 
facility is predicated upon the notion that Treasury and agency 
securities have no credit risk. That facility will be extending 
loans of up to a year using these securities as collateral.
    The one potential problem is that unless Congress raises 
the debt ceiling in the next few months, U.S. Treasury and 
agency securities will face the prospect of default. Now, while 
I certainly will not vote to default on the debt, I think some 
of my colleagues may not feel the same way.
    In light of the events in the financial system over the 
past week, how damaging would a debt default be to our banking 
sector, particularly to regional banks?
    Secretary Yellen. It would be completely devastating, and I 
do not think that Congress should for a second contemplate the 
possibility of not raising the debt ceiling to pay our bills. 
This is the cornerstone of what makes our financial markets the 
soundest and best in the world, and people trust that the 
government stands ready to pay its bills. It would be a 
calamity.
    Senator Menendez. And obviously, if we are using Treasury 
securities to back up the loans that we are making, if those 
Treasury securities default, then we have a cascading effect.
    Secretary Yellen. It is beyond contemplation.
    Senator Menendez. Is it possible, or I should say isn't it 
possible that if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling well 
before any default, that we could run the risk of seeing more 
runs on regional banks?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes. Well, we have seen that the concern 
about whether Congress would meet this responsibility has 
provoked concern in financial markets. That was evident, for 
example, in 2011, when there was a downgrading of the U.S. 
credit rating because of doubts as to whether or not Congress 
would act appropriately.
    Senator Menendez. Well, the fact is that a debt ceiling 
fight has always been dangerous. It is dangerous for our 
financial system----
    Secretary Yellen. Agreed.
    Senator Menendez [continuing]. It is dangerous for our 
businesses, it is dangerous for working families, and it is 
dangerous to put at risk the U.S. dollar as the reserve of 
choice in the world--which others are seeking to replace us 
in--which has enormous benefits to us. Wouldn't you say that 
having our dollar as the reserve choice in the world----
    Secretary Yellen. Yes, I completely agree. And it is 
because, in part because our financial system is so deep, and 
Treasuries are regarded as so safe and liquid.
    Senator Menendez. Now in 2018, Congress passed a bill which 
was signed into law by President Trump that relaxed regulation 
for institutions like Silicon Valley Bank. That law, which I 
opposed, exempted those banks from enhanced prudential 
standards and stress tests, raising the threshold at which a 
bank would be considered systemically important.
    So, even as the law kept Silicon Valley Bank off the list 
of systemically important institutions, regulators on a 
bipartisan basis rightly cited systemic risk to justify their 
actions over the weekend. So, Secretary Yellen, isn't it true 
that the situation at Silicon Valley Bank posed systemic risks?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, look, I think it is important for 
regulators, the banking supervisors, to examine what happened 
at this bank. But clearly the bank had a very high proportion 
of uninsured deposits, which made it vulnerable to runs, and it 
experienced devastating runs.
    Senator Menendez. But, Madam Secretary, if the regulators 
say that the reason they are intervening is because there was 
systemic risk, then it must have been systemic risk, right?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, in the sense that the chances of 
contagion--that other banks might be regarded as unsound and 
suffer runs--seemed extremely high, and the consequences would 
be very serious.
    Senator Menendez. It seems to me that institutions like 
Silicon Valley Bank, while we still have a lot to learn, have 
the potential to be systemically important, and our laws and 
regulations should treat them as such.
    Let me close on the following. In the President's budget 
proposal, there is yet a glaring absence of an issue critical 
to families in my State and in other States in the country. The 
budget continues to allow C corporations to fully deduct State 
and local taxes as under current law. Isn't that the case?
    Secretary Yellen. I am not sure. I think so, but----
    Senator Menendez. Well, for the purposes of our discussion, 
let me just assure you that the budget allows C corporations to 
fully deduct State and local taxes under current law. But it 
does not propose the same tax benefit for middle-class 
families. Is that fair to say?
    Secretary Yellen. The issue of State and local taxes is one 
we think that Congress should address.
    Senator Menendez. Well, I will close by saying if C 
corporations can deduct State and local taxes, middle-class 
families should be able to deduct State and local taxes.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Scott?
    Senator Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Secretary 
Yellen, thank you for being here this morning. Thank you also 
for the conversation that we had on Monday. We may not always 
see eye to eye on a number of issues, but your availability was 
helpful in understanding and appreciating the actions of the 
administration. So, thank you for that part.
    Secretary Yellen. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Scott. I am sure you have seen, and maybe even had 
a big hand in proposing some of the President's budget 
requests. I can honestly spend hours talking about the 
President's budget, and how much I dislike it. I think it is 
bad for the economy; I think it is bad for the American people.
    We certainly see $5 trillion of tax increases, $7 trillion 
of spending, the highest rate of taxes on individuals in the 
last 40 years, and a new corporate tax rate higher than the tax 
rate imposed by the Chinese Communist Party on their own 
businesses, more and more policies that undermine our own 
Nation's energy independence and energy security. This is not a 
budget that unifies the country. This budget only seeks to 
isolate and divide us. This budget, simply said, taxes too much 
and spends too much.
    In the midst of all this budget talk, however, we are once 
again having to exercise important oversight over the Federal 
regulators and agencies responsible for ensuring they are doing 
the job that Congress gave them the tools to do. As such, I 
want to spend some time discussing Silicon Valley Bank.
    While there are many questions that must be answered, I do 
know a few things for sure. First, the bank failed because of 
its management and because of its board. I know that the 
failure of SVB also was contributed to by a lax regulatory 
environment.
    I believe that the State and Federal regulators failed to 
appropriately use the tools they have to supervise and regulate 
the failed institutions; and finally, that Biden's handling of 
the economy contributed to these bank failures. The President's 
budget is further evidence of reckless taxes and spending that 
will only exacerbate the highest inflation we have seen in 40 
years.
    This impact will be felt by everyone and everything from 
grocery bills to financial institutions. It appears that the 
San Francisco Fed was asleep at the wheel. They failed to meet 
their basic, not enhanced, but basic supervisory 
responsibilities, and therefore missed their opportunity to use 
enhanced supervisory tools if necessary.
    Instead of taking accountability for this blatant failure, 
regulators are now forecasting that they plan to increase 
regulations on the rest of the banking industry; in other 
words, the banks that made responsible business decisions and 
have not failed. The failure to supervise is inexcusable, and I 
plan to hold the regulators accountable.
    This administration's tax-and-spend reckless policies 
fueled inflation and will only further lead to unmanageable 
inflation and higher and higher interest rates.
    Secretary Yellen, will this administration acknowledge that 
their reckless tax and spending contributed to not only the 
challenges that we see in everyday households, but also to 
challenges that we are facing today with SVB?
    Secretary Yellen. Look, inflation is too high, and it is 
the President's top priority to bring it down. And there are 
many contributors to why inflation is too high; importantly, 
fallout from the pandemic and Russia's war on Ukraine that 
boosted food and energy prices. Many countries around the world 
suffer from this same problem regardless of what their fiscal 
policy was.
    Senator Scott. Thank you. I do not want to cut you off, but 
I only have a minute left, and I want to just offer my 
synopsis. There is no doubt that the pandemic was in the 
rearview mirror when we saw the COVID relief response in 
January of 2021 that spent $1.9 trillion.
    The only thing missing in that COVID relief bill was COVID 
relief. We had 1 percent for COVID vaccines, under 10 percent 
for COVID-related health, but we had a lot of liberal policies 
embedded in the $2 trillion of spending, which then led and 
accelerated inflation to 9.1 percent or a 40-year high.
    The Fed response to the high level of inflation was to have 
eight rate increases, leading to a liquidity challenge that we 
are now seeing the results of.
    Thank you very much.
    Senator Crapo [presiding]. Thank you.
    Senator Hassan?
    Senator Hassan. Thank you, Ranking Member Crapo, and for 
holding this hearing today. A ``thank you'' to you and the 
chair.
    Secretary Yellen, thank you so much for being here and for 
testifying before the committee. I would like to follow up on 
issues that my colleagues asked about, concerning the recent 
actions that the administration has taken to protect our 
economy.
    Last weekend, the Treasury and other agencies took several 
steps to strengthen public confidence following the failure of 
two banks. The priority of Federal regulators needs to continue 
to be protecting families and small businesses, by ensuring the 
stability of our banking system and our economy more broadly.
    Given the events of the past week, I would like to 
understand how Treasury is evaluating the effectiveness of its 
recent action. So, what specific benchmarks are you using to 
measure the success of Treasury's actions? For example, what 
are the economic indicators that you are actively monitoring?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, we are looking at indicators of the 
functioning and stress in the banking system. We want to make 
sure that the problems of these two banks do not spread to 
others. So we are monitoring very carefully the situation of 
banks in the United States using a wide range of indicators.
    And a more general problem that concerns us is the 
possibility that if banks are under stress, they might be 
reluctant to lend while they worry about shoring up liquidity 
and capital. We could see credit become more expensive and less 
available, and there are a variety of statistics that we can 
look at to judge whether or not banks are tightening credit--
things like the senior loan officers' survey of credit terms 
and related statistics on the cost of borrowing, because that 
could turn this into a source of significant downside economic 
risk.
    Senator Hassan. Well, I appreciate that. I think being 
really clear about what the goals are and having transparency 
about defining success is critical here, and I just want to 
urge you and the administration to continue communicating with 
Congress as it closely monitors the situation, to ensure that 
we have a coordinated and responsible and effective response to 
the entire situation.
    I want to turn now to tax issues that are overseen by 
Treasury. Last year, my bipartisan Home Energy Savings Act, 
something I introduced with Senator Collins, was signed into 
law. This bill expanded tax cuts for homeowners who make energy 
efficiency upgrades, such as installing a more efficient HVAC 
system in their homes, which also, obviously, lowers energy 
bills.
    How is the Treasury increasing awareness of these tax cuts 
for homeowners, given the high energy and other costs that 
families are facing?
    Secretary Yellen. Well, as you point out, there are really 
critical supports here for taxpayers. They can get up to $2,000 
for upgrades like heat pumps, 30 percent on the cost of 
installing solar panels, and so forth. We have worked with IRS 
to publish plain language frequently asked questions on all of 
these credits, and you can find these on the IRS's IRA home 
page.
    There is also a site, something called cleanenergy.gov. But 
really, we want to get the word out broadly, and we would be 
eager to work with you to discuss ways that we can make sure 
homeowners know what they are eligible for.
    Senator Hassan. Well, I would look forward to continuing to 
work on that. Obviously, with high energy costs being what they 
are, especially in the Northeast, it is really, really 
important that we get the word out.
    Last question here. Along with Senator Brown, I am leading 
the effort to cut red tape for online sellers by reducing the 
number of casual online sellers who receive unnecessary and 
confusing 1099 tax forms. It is important that we work across 
the aisle to find a bipartisan way to cut down on these 
unnecessary forms.
    As Congress considers various ways to address this 
challenge in a bipartisan way, will Treasury provide analysis 
of the impact of different proposals on online sellers?
    Secretary Yellen. Certainly, we will try to work with you 
on that. You know, we were trying to implement a provision of 
the Rescue Plan that required reporting of transactions over 
$600. It is set to take effect this year, but we realized that 
there were concerns, broad concerns about that timeline.
    So we have delayed. And certainly we want to reduce 
confusion, and we will work with you to try to do that.
    Senator Hassan. Well, I appreciate that very much, and I 
see that I am over time. I will just note that there are a 
number of us in Congress who want to do more than delay it. We 
want to correct what we think is a bad policy----
    Secretary Yellen. We would work with Congress.
    Senator Hassan [continuing]. And provides lots of 
confusion. So, thank you very much.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    Senator Young is next.
    Senator Young. Welcome, Madam Secretary. It is good to have 
you here before the committee. I want to take a moment to join 
my Republican colleagues in expressing my frustration and 
displeasure over the way the administration has handled the 
OECD Pillar 2 negotiations. To that end, Mr. Chairman, I would 
ask unanimous consent that a copy of my longer statement on 
this topic be entered into the record.
    The Chairman. Without objection, so ordered.
    [The prepared statement of Senator Young appears in the 
appendix.]
    Senator Young. Thank you. So, to summarize this statement, 
my concern is whether enacting the regime globally would 
undermine the incentive to invest in the United States and to 
grow jobs here in the United States. I fear the answer to that 
question is ``yes.''
    In particular, the Pillar 2 Under-Taxed Profits Rule would 
uniquely disadvantage American workers and job-creating 
businesses by providing our trading partners with the political 
blessing to tax the U.S. activity of U.S. companies. That is 
right. Let me repeat that.
    Foreign countries, under the Under-Taxed Profits Rule of 
these negotiations, could tax the U.S. activity of U.S. 
companies. This would of course directly undercut our American 
sovereignty, but it would also impact the legislative power of 
tax writers to provide bipartisan, well-crafted, thoughtful 
economic incentives like the research and development tax 
provisions, important to our dynamic economy.
    This credit, which my bipartisan colleagues and I are 
fighting so hard to protect--and much more--look to be wiped 
out under Pillar 2. So, Madam Secretary, American workers and 
American companies deserve a better deal, and I want to begin 
by asking you to go back to the negotiating table and negotiate 
that deal for them.
    Moving on. Madam Secretary, as you know, President Biden 
has promised dozens of times that he will not raise taxes on 
anyone earning less than $400,000 a year. During the budget 
reconciliation exercise in August of last year--that was our 
second budget reconciliation, you will recall--I introduced the 
Not One Penny in Taxes Raised amendment, to allow the American 
people to hold members of Congress who agreed with that pledge, 
and to hold the President accountable.
    That amendment passed the United States Senate by a vote of 
98 to 1, 49 out of 50 of my Democratic colleagues agreed with 
Republicans, we cannot raise taxes when Americans are 
struggling. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that a copy 
of my amendment and the roll call votes be entered into the 
record.
    The Chairman. Without objection, so ordered.
    [The documents appear in the appendix beginning on p. 108.]
    Senator Young. Secretary Yellen, in the view of the 
administration, which tax rates or other provisions from the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that are scheduled to sunset after 2025 
must be extended in order not to violate President Biden's 
pledge that no taxes will be increased on anyone earning less 
than $400,000?
    For the benefit of all members in understanding these 
important red lines for the President of the United States, 
please include all provisions that you understand would cause 
the President's pledge to be violated if they are not extended.
    Secretary Yellen. Well, there certainly are aspects of TCJA 
that, if they sunset, would impact households or taxpayers 
earning under $400,000. The President has, as you mentioned, 
pledged he does not want to see taxes raised by a penny on 
anyone making under that.
    Senator Young. That is right.
    Secretary Yellen. So, he stands ready to work with 
Congress----
    Senator Young. Well, no, no. The President made the pledge, 
and so I want to know the administration's position on this. I 
know my Democratic colleagues want to know it as well. My time 
is short, so can you please provide the specific TCJA 
provisions that have to be extended in order to keep President 
Biden's tax promise?
    Secretary Yellen. I do not know that I can provide you with 
that. I think there are a lot of complicated provisions, and 
exactly what happens to different taxpayers will depend on----
    Senator Young. That is reasonable.
    You are a reasonable person. I am known as a reasonable 
person, one right now who is 2 seconds over time. So I would 
just ask you, Madam Secretary, could you commit to providing me 
and other members of this committee with that comprehensive 
list within 2 weeks from today? It should not be difficult. You 
have an army of people supporting you.
    Secretary Yellen. I think it is a very complex exercise, 
and I am not sure that----
    Senator Young. Is it complex to keep the pledge?
    The Chairman. The time of the gentleman has expired. I want 
to work with the gentleman with respect to the updates on the 
tax law. It is well known that on our side we opposed it, and 
your side supported it. The gentleman wants to know how we are 
going to proceed, and the Secretary said it is complicated. I 
am going to work with my colleague.
    Senator Young. Well, let us work our way through the 
complications so we can all keep our pledges not to--this 
cannot be violated. I have told my constituents it will not be, 
so----
    Secretary Yellen. And we agree with that and would like to 
work with you.
    Senator Young. All right. I will look forward to that list. 
Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Daines is next.
    Senator Daines. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Secretary Yellen, 
thanks for being here today.
    Secretary Yellen. Thank you.
    Senator Daines. Secretary Yellen, the President's budget 
includes $4.7 trillion--with a ``t''--in total tax hikes, 
including $1.8 trillion in new taxes on Main Street businesses. 
The President's budget also includes a shadow tax increase on 
small businesses in Montana and across the country by remaining 
aptly silent on the future of the 20-percent pass-through 
business tax deduction.
    We must remind ourselves that 95 percent of the businesses 
in the United States of America are pass-throughs. They are not 
C corps, and yet this budget was silent on a 20-percent tax 
increase coming for many small businesses in the course of 
2026. I am planning to reintroduce my Main Street Tax Certainty 
Act in the coming weeks, which will protect these businesses 
from this shadow tax hike by making this important deduction 
permanent.
    With the President's pledge in mind, will you commit to 
making the 199A deduction permanent?
    Secretary Yellen. I mean, all I can really say is that the 
President has pledged not to raise taxes on individuals or 
small businesses making under $400,000, but no promises beyond 
that.
    Senator Daines. Okay. I will take that as a ``no'' and move 
on to my next question.
    Senator Young raised this issue of Pillar 2 of the OECD 
proposal, which you spearheaded or championed. It is littered 
with these complex rules that would benefit state-owned 
enterprises at the expense of capitalist competitors.
    Why are you a proponent for a framework that would allow 
China to tax American companies--and I understand this; I was 
involved with global operations for most of my 20-year career 
in the private sector--tax companies on their American 
operations if they fall below the minimum tax threshold, even 
if they fall below the threshold by utilizing the bipartisan 
tax incentives, such as the R&D tax credit.
    Secretary Yellen. So, the agreement does permit--it 
includes an under-taxed payments rule by which other countries 
can exercise their rights to impose taxes on operations of 
foreign countries----
    Senator Daines. Which would include China?
    Secretary Yellen [continuing]. That do not abide by the 15-
percent tax. The United States can impose a top-up tax to 
ensure that those revenues end up in the U.S. Treasury instead 
of in a foreign country.
    Senator Daines. I will move on to the Child Tax Credits. As 
you know, Secretary Yellen, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act 
doubled the Child Tax Credit, from $1,000 to $2,000, and 
increased the refundability threshold to $1,400. I was 
certainly disappointed at the time that all of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle opposed this change and made it 
impossible to make it permanent. But I am glad that we enacted 
it, as Republicans, into law.
    The President's budget proposes increasing the Child Tax 
Credit from the current $2,000 to $3,600. It makes it fully 
refundable and delivered on a monthly basis. However, I see 
they did not make that change permanent. It expires in 2025, 
even though there are no limitations in presidential budgets to 
do so.
    My question would be this. Does the President believe that 
the Child Tax Credit should be made permanent at $3,600, and if 
so, are you willing to then eliminate the SALT deduction, which 
overwhelmingly benefits the wealthy, to give working families 
an expanded Child Tax Credit that importantly never ends?
    Secretary Yellen. So the President is very supportive of 
the Child Tax Credit, proposes to continue it for several years 
until many of the provisions in the individual income tax from 
TCJA that affect exemptions and the Child Tax Credit expire. 
And then there will need to be consideration of what to do as 
those----
    Senator Daines. Right, but he will not make that provision 
permanent is what you are saying? The budget says it is going 
to expire in 2025.
    Secretary Yellen. That is because there needs to be a 
broader consideration----
    Senator Daines. There does not have to be, though. You 
could put the Child Tax Credit there and make that permanent. 
So, we could debate the tax cuts but----
    Secretary Yellen. He is very supportive of it, and we would 
look to work with you to make sure that it is----
    The Chairman. The time of the gentleman has expired.
    Senator Cantwell is next.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary 
Yellen, thank you so much for not just today, but over the 
weekend and all the attention that you have given to this 
issue.
    It really does impact small businesses, and while the name 
of the bank might be Silicon Valley Bank, I guarantee you the 
innovation economy comes through Seattle, and probably many 
small businesses in my State were impacted by what transpired. 
And that is why we need to make sure that the banking system 
really does have mechanisms that help the start-up economy and 
the innovators.
    In my mind, that is why we did CHIPS and Science, to let a 
lot of innovation unfold. But people have to get financing. So, 
Jesse Salk, the grandson of Jonas Salk, is a molecular 
biologist and clinical oncologist who started TwinStrand 
Biosciences in the State of Washington.
    He and his team at TwinStrand are developing cutting-edge 
gene sequencing techniques to help us fight cancer, and he told 
my office this week that ``it was a big deal to step outside my 
comfort zone and start a company to help get a new genomic 
technology to help treat cancer patients faster. The last thing 
I expected us to need to think about was if we could rely on a 
bank.''
    So, the potential impact of Jesse's company having to pause 
or even cease operations due to banking failure is not just 
jobs or dollars lost--which are important considerations to our 
economy--it is actually lives lost too. So, I again appreciate 
what the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and everyone who stepped in 
did. But it never should have happened in the first place.
    So my questions really are about these small businesses. 
Again, I think people think of them like, ``Oh, they are going 
to be giant businesses.'' But at their start, they are small 
businesses. And I think Silicon Valley Bank was able to attract 
and help further this. So now where do we go? Where do we go?
    Are we going to push Jesse back towards a larger bank? I am 
curious--one of the reasons why there was so much of a 
concentration is that there was a requirement by the bank that 
you have all of your holdings in that bank. And so, I want to 
hear what you think about that.
    How do we ensure that these small businesses feel safe, and 
are we just going to see--how do we, again, treat a start-up 
economy and allow these funds to work cost-effectively, and 
should we get rid of this requirement by a bank that says that, 
to get these terms, they have to have all their funds in that 
bank?
    Secretary Yellen. So, I am not aware of the requirement 
that you mentioned, but certainly we want to make sure that 
depositors--whether they are individuals or households or small 
businesses--feel confident that the banks that they entrust 
their savings to or their working balances that they use to pay 
their workers, we want to make sure that they feel confident 
that these banks are safe and that they can do business with 
them.
    And that is an important reason why we stepped in with the 
FDIC and the Federal Reserve to intervene, because I do believe 
the banking system in the United States is sound and resilient, 
and we wanted to make sure that the problems at Silicon Valley 
Bank and Signature Bank did not undermine confidence in the 
soundness of banks around the country.
    And we wanted to make sure that there was not contagion 
that could affect other banks and their depositors.
    Senator Cantwell. Yes. So, it is basically a requirement, 
an affirmative covenant that they maintain all borrowers' 
depositors.
    Secretary Yellen. That is something imposed by the bank, I 
assume?
    Senator Cantwell. Yes, yes, on the start-ups, as a way to 
corral. So I think this is why you had such a concentration, 
and we should look at that as a particular issue.
    What about Glass-Steagall? I have been a big supporter of 
Glass-Steagall. And when you come to this moment--and I keep 
thinking, ``Why did we ever allow us to have the commingling of 
commercial and investment banking?''
    It seems to me that continuing to protect depositors, and 
having a system where people can take risk, and if they suffer 
loss, is okay. But that is not what we have. We have such a 
commingled system now. What do you think about relooking at 
Glass-Steagall?
    Now, I am not asking for the Treasury Secretary to make big 
news here. I am really just asking if you think this same 
situation would have occurred, the way it occurred, if we had 
not, in 2000, gotten rid of Glass-Steagall?
    Secretary Yellen. You know, we are very focused right now 
on stabilizing the banking system and shoring up confidence, 
and I think there will be plenty of time when it will be 
appropriate to look at what happened and consider whether or 
not regulatory or supervisory changes are necessary. And I look 
forward to working with you and discussing what happened and 
what response is appropriate.
    But for now, I would like to see confidence restored in the 
soundness of American banks.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Well, I would just say this on this subject. I believe, in 
the information age, one of America's secrets is access to 
capital. So I want great access to capital formation. I do not 
want to see these banks that understand start-ups go away. I do 
not want it to be concentrated at big banks.
    But I also want us to make sure that we have a system that 
is--I think we see now from 2009 what happened, and now with 
this incident, that the commingling of these things or giving 
people--I am not sure that is the way we get access to capital. 
I am not sure that that is--or at least we did not have a 
system that protected us. It did not protect us in the end. So, 
we have to get something----
    Secretary Yellen. These were depository institutions; they 
were not investment banks.
    Senator Cantwell. Yes.
    Secretary Yellen. They were normal banks.
    Senator Cantwell. Yes, but blurred.
    The Chairman. Madam Secretary, we have to move on. I happen 
to share Senator Cantwell's views with respect to this matter.
    Next is Senator Whitehouse, then Senator Casey.
    Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary 
Yellen, I think you are the most available of all of the 
cabinet members to come to hearings, and I just want you to 
know that I appreciate it. You seem quite fearless about coming 
into the lion's den, and we are always grateful to have you.
    Secretary Yellen. Thank you.
    Senator Whitehouse. You spoke recently to the Climate-
related Financial Risk Advisory Committee, and in your remarks 
you pointed out that climate change will likely become ``a 
source of shocks to the financial system that would lead to 
declines. This would be precipitated by declines in asset 
values that could cascade through the financial system,'' which 
is a warning that Freddie Mac has also made with respect to 
coastal property values.
    You added that rising insured losses could cause insurers 
to pull back from high-risk areas, with potentially devastating 
consequences for property values.
    We just had a hearing in my Budget Committee on wildfire 
risk causing that effect to insurance and property markets, and 
before that, coastal flooding and storm risk causing that 
effect in insurance and property markets, and then the whole 
thing can spill over to other parts of our interconnected 
financial system--again, part of what Freddie Mac warned about, 
that it would be worse than 2008.
    We also heard testimony that the coastal property value 
crash risk--and the wildfire property risk--could perfectly 
well happen at the same time. It is not a question of one or 
the other; they could both come to pass.
    So we all know that shocks and panics and collapses and 
disorderly transitions are notoriously hard to predict as to 
exactly when they will occur. They are far easier to predict as 
to what their level of severity will be should they occur.
    My question to you is, setting aside timing, how serious to 
the U.S. economy could the economic shocks that you warned of 
in that speech be?
    Secretary Yellen. So, I do not know how to quantify that 
for you, but I do believe these are very serious risks. The 
Financial Stability Oversight Council is prioritizing analyzing 
those risks and has recognized that they pose a systemic threat 
to American financial stability.
    The regulators, the banking regulators, FHFA, are all 
taking steps to analyze the way in which these risks could 
affect the financial system, financial institutions. And we 
created the committee that you referred to in order to bring 
expertise into this enterprise.
    But I think it is critically, critically important, and 
these are severe risks.
    Senator Whitehouse. Potentially deadly serious.
    Secretary Yellen. Yes, very severe risks.
    Senator Whitehouse. And just to--for people who are not 
familiar with this particular arena, the words ``systemic 
risk'' sound like a rather mild and inoffensive term. But it 
actually refers to pretty devastating stuff, does it not?
    Secretary Yellen. Yes, that is what systemic refers to, 
exactly. Things that could cascade throughout the financial 
system and have severe consequences for financial stability and 
the economy.
    Senator Whitehouse. Thank you.
    In the time that I have left, I wanted to flag for you a 
letter that I will put into the record now, if I may, Mr. 
Chairman----
    The Chairman. Without objection, so ordered.
    [The letter appears in the appendix beginning on p. 56.]
    Senator Whitehouse [continuing]. That a great number of us 
on this committee signed to the Acting Director of FinCEN. The 
chairman was a signatory of it; Senator Grassley was a 
signatory of it; Senator Warren was a signatory of it. And we 
are concerned that the development of the beneficial ownership 
rule has been far less than we had hoped, and far less than we 
believed the actual statutory language directed, both regarding 
the so-called access rule, which is a subject of the letter, 
and regarding the verification standard, and regarding the 
court order requirement.
    If you would, be good enough to take this back to your team 
and make sure that you have a look at this, and make sure that 
you approve of where they are going, because I believe they 
have missed a very significant opportunity to significantly 
strengthen our battle against kleptocracy with the rather weak 
way in which these three parts of the rule have been rolled 
out.
    Thank you very much.
    Secretary Yellen. Thank you.
    Senator Whitehouse. That is for ``under advisement.''
    Secretary Yellen. Thank you. I take it that way.
    The Chairman. Senator Casey?
    Senator Casey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Yellen, 
you have been very patient. I am the last questioner, and I 
will try to keep within my time, in light of your appearance 
here. We are grateful for your time here. We are grateful for 
your service to the country.
    I do want to start just preliminarily by noting, in earlier 
questioning about the phone call return rate at the IRS, there 
have been statements made today, some of which went 
unchallenged. Am I right to say that last year the phone call 
return rate at the IRS was about a low number, like 13 percent?
    Secretary Yellen. Correct.
    Senator Casey. And the current number is between 80 and 90 
percent?
    Secretary Yellen. That is correct.
    Senator Casey. That is important for the public record, 
because I know there is a narrative that the other side falsely 
is perpetuating. So, 80 to 90 percent is a whole lot better 
than 13. You do not have to comment on that, but I will just 
state that for the record.
    Secretary Yellen. It is a huge, huge improvement.
    Senator Casey. And that is----
    Secretary Yellen. And the IRS has been tremendously under-
resourced, and the resources that Congress provided through the 
IRA are critically important. They hired 5,000 customer service 
representatives, have made enormous progress in working through 
the paper backlog, and now we are going to see continued 
improvements and great improvements in customer service.
    Senator Casey. Thanks so much for that.
    I want to talk to you first more broadly about energy 
communities, in particular coal communities. I live in 
Scranton, PA, born and raised there, still live there, and it 
happens to be the hometown of the President.
    But we live in a region that has basically five counties 
that were so-called anthracite, hard coal counties 
historically. Then in southwestern Pennsylvania, we have a much 
larger number of counties that were so-called bituminous or 
soft coal counties.
    I do not have to tell you--most Americans know the story of 
what happened to that industry. We were told, though, most 
recently that the Appalachian Regional Commission reports that 
coal employment has fallen by some 62 percent over the last 
decade, leading to a broader decline in the region. That is 
true in these communities in Pennsylvania.
    The report also indicates that overall private-sector 
employment in Appalachian coal counties--that would of course 
go to West Virginia and several other States--has been flat 
since the Great Recession, but it was increasing in the non-
coal communities. In the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act, I 
fought for an additional tax credit of 10 percent that would 
encourage private companies to build new energy and 
manufacturing projects in these energy communities.
    To date, the Treasury Department has not released guidance 
on how companies can claim these credits, or guidance on what 
exact areas qualify. So, without that guidance, companies have 
been reluctant to announce new projects in these coal or energy 
communities, and we have seen new investment flowing to non-
energy communities.
    So I would ask you to tell us, if you can, when can 
Pennsylvania and other States that have these coal communities 
expect Treasury to finalize the rules, the guidance, so these 
coal country communities can get their share of new jobs and 
investment?
    Secretary Yellen. This is a tremendously important 
provision. We recognize how hard hit these communities are, and 
how important this bonus is. I can tell you that my staff is 
working literally around the clock to write and implement these 
regulations. They are tremendously complex, and we will do 
this; it is a priority item. We will do this as quickly as we 
possibly can.
    I typically have several meetings a week with Tax Policy to 
make sure that things are moving as rapidly as humanly 
possible, and this is a priority item for us.
    Senator Casey. Thank you, Madam Secretary. I appreciate 
that.
    And the next question I think I will submit for the record. 
I just want to preview it for you. We have this bizarre 
circumstance in the tax code where corporations are given a tax 
break for activities that are often union-busting activities.
    So, they get a tax break for that, and at the same time in 
the 2017 tax bill passed here in the Senate, a provision for 
union dues deduction and work expense deductions was taken away 
from individuals. So the worker got a tax break taken away, and 
big corporations have had this benefit to allow them to union 
bust and get a break for it.
    I have a No Tax Breaks for Union Busting Act with 30 of our 
colleagues that I am trying to pass, and I will ask you a 
specific question about that. But in the interest of time, I 
will submit that for the record.
    Thanks very much.
    Secretary Yellen. Thank you, Senator Casey.
    The Chairman. Madam Secretary, I very much share Senator 
Casey's views. I am on his legislation for No Tax Breaks for 
Union Busting. And I think you all had that dialogue about the 
energy communities provision. Madam Secretary, I think we would 
call this a priority. I would like to designate it a super-
priority, because Senator Casey led the effort for those energy 
communities in the effort on the IRA.
    I know it is extraordinarily important to a host of these 
communities where there is a history of one energy policy, and 
we have to get them the help Senator Casey's measure 
envisioned. So, I thank him for it.
    Madam Secretary, we are going to let you leave in the kind 
of 2 minutes that I think we may have remaining, so we keep you 
on the clock. As usual, you have accounted for yourself very 
well today.
    Secretary Yellen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. And I especially appreciate your saying, for 
what I believe is the first time, that prioritization of debt 
ceiling payments is just unworkable. That is the message that 
needs to go out far and wide. In this committee--let the record 
show--the Secretary has again said that is correct. This 
committee has jurisdiction over these issues relating to the 
full faith and credit of the United States, so I very much 
appreciate what you are saying to us in your comments about 
clean energy, your comments about housing.
    You had the waterfront in front of you to talk about, and I 
just want to make one point in wrapping up. Republicans, in 
their tax amendments, these various tax amendments, define 
taxable income so as to give many billionaires a free pass on 
taxes.
    That is really what the difference is. We feel very 
strongly about protecting all those firefighters and nurses and 
all the small business people. We all share that view. We are 
just unwilling, as are you and the President--to your credit--
to give billionaires a free pass.
    It is all about how these amendments define taxable income, 
which would basically keep billionaires from getting audited or 
paying little if any taxes for years on end. So, we look 
forward to working with you in the days ahead.
    For the information of members, questions for the record 
for the Secretary are due at 5 p.m. next Thursday, March 23rd.
    And the Finance Committee--and we thank you again, 
Secretary Yellen--is adjourned.
    Secretary Yellen. Thank you, Chair Wyden.
    [Whereupon, at 12:59 p.m., the hearing was concluded.]

                              ----------                              


                Prepared Statement of Hon. Mike Crapo, 
                       a U.S. Senator From Idaho
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome to today's hearing, Secretary 
Yellen. I appreciate you appearing before the committee in a timely 
manner following the release of the President's budget.

    While the budget is the focus of today's hearing, I expect that the 
emergency measures taken this weekend by the Treasury Department, 
Federal Reserve, and FDIC will also be appropriately discussed today. 
It is important to learn more about what initiated the run on Silicon 
Valley Bank, the impact of the Federal Reserve holding interest rates 
low for too long, and what steps were--or were not--taken by Silicon 
Valley Bank and the banking regulators.

    In the meantime, I am concerned about the precedent of guaranteeing 
all deposits and the market expectation moving forward. Once started, 
moral hazard--like inflation--is not easily contained and does long-
lasting damage.

    Inflation played a key role in the recent bank failures, as rising 
interest rates and mismanaged interest rate risk led to a liquidity 
crisis. Indeed, there is no issue more critical than the unacceptably 
high inflation American families continue to face every day. Americans 
have now experienced 16 months of inflation at or above 6 percent. 
Costs of rent, groceries, and services continue to rise. Wages cannot 
keep up.

    Last year, the administration committed to working in a bipartisan 
fashion to address this serious problem, noting the budget must 
complement monetary policy. Instead, a reckless tax-and-spend agenda 
was forced through Congress, rolling out trillions of dollars in debt-
financed spending and hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on 
U.S. job creators.

    The Congressional Budget Office says the Inflation Reduction Act 
will not only increase inflation in the near term, but Treasury will 
collect less corporate tax revenue with the partisan IRA in effect--
despite being sold as a bill to make corporations pay their ``fair 
share.''

    The Federal Reserve is having to compensate for this 
administration's lack of budget discipline with growing interest rate 
hikes. Rising interest rates are impacting household budgets; the 
Federal Government's coffers; and, as we saw this week, our banking 
system.

    The President's budget demonstrates the administration has not 
learned from its mistakes. After 2 years of policies that contributed 
to record-high inflation and excessive deficit spending, this 
administration is doubling down with more of the same. The spending 
binge must stop. We must address our growing deficits in order to put 
the United States' finances on a sustainable path, and pro-growth tax 
policy should be part of the solution.

    The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act led to one of the strongest economies in 
generations. TCJA introduced competitive tax rates while broadening the 
base, including by enacting the first global minimum tax of its kind, 
and putting an end to corporate inversions. It also contributed to 
record-high corporate tax receipts, both nominally and as a share of 
gross domestic product.

    But instead of considering bipartisan, pro-growth policies, the 
President's budget includes a whopping $4.7 trillion of new and 
increased taxes on American job creators, which ultimately means fewer 
jobs and lower wages. It also includes higher taxes on American energy 
producers.

    Earlier today, Senator Barrasso and a number of his Republican 
colleagues, including myself, sent a letter to you, Secretary Yellen, 
raising concerns with the over-$100 billion in increased energy taxes 
proposed in the President's fiscal year 2024 budget. Mr. Chairman, I 
ask that the letter be included in the hearing record.

    The administration's shortsighted, partisan agenda extends to its 
unilateral approach to the OECD international tax agreement. For the 
last 2 years, Treasury has used the OECD negotiations to attempt to 
compel changes in U.S. law without regard for the effect on U.S. 
revenue, U.S. companies, and U.S. workers.

    Not only has the administration failed to put a stop to digital 
services taxes, but now foreign countries threaten to impose 
extraterritorial taxes on U.S. companies under the global minimum tax--
at Treasury's invitation. The latest OECD guidance confirms the 
administration has agreed to allow foreign countries to collect U.S. 
GILTI revenue, and worse, tax U.S. companies on their U.S. profits in 
violation of our tax treaties. The budget fails to consider these 
revenue impacts, which, if implemented, will result in billions of 
dollars of lost U.S. revenue.

    Meanwhile, the administration continues to hide its true intentions 
for ``transforming'' the IRS. The budget doubles down on the $80 
billion already given to the IRS, including 2 additional years of plus-
up funding totaling $29.1 billion solely for ``enforcement and 
compliance initiatives,'' in addition to $14.1 billion more of yearly 
funding. That's another $43 billion!

    Secretary Yellen, I agree with you that having a funding plan for 
an agency budget that dwarfs many others is ``critical.'' In the 
meantime, the IRS has embarked on a ``spend first, plan later'' 
approach that is not transparent or responsible, and is a surefire 
recipe for error, waste, and mismanagement.

    While we may not have all the details, we do know that only 6 
percent of the existing plus-up funding is for modernization, while 
over 62 percent is solely for hiring--more than 93 percent of which is 
enforcement hiring. These new funds are not going to replace retiring 
IRS agents, as annual appropriations already provide that funding, and 
the administration has not requested any reductions in IRS annual 
funding to account for replacing retirees with plus-up funding.

    Secretary Yellen, there are opportunities for the administration to 
work across the aisle on common-sense economic policies, but nothing 
suggests the President is abandoning the partisan tax-and-spend 
policies of the last 2 years.

    This administration must recommit to working with Republicans to 
develop real solutions that will stabilize the economy and create 
higher wages and opportunities for American workers.

                                 ______

                             March 16, 2023

The Honorable Janet Yellen
Secretary
Department of the Treasury
1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20220

Dear Secretary Yellen:

We write with grave concern regarding the administration's continued 
hostility towards American energy production. Currently, working 
families and small businesses are facing immense challenges including 
high energy prices. At the same time, our allies and partners across 
the globe are asking for reliable American energy resources to escape 
their dependence on Russian energy and to deal with the energy crisis. 
Instead of increasing U.S. energy production, the administration is 
focused on increasing energy taxes. The administration has once again 
doubled down on weaponizing the tax code against U.S. energy producers. 
The Department of Treasury's General Explanations of the 
Administration's Fiscal Year 2024 Revenue Proposals (Green Book) is 
filled with crippling tax hikes on the production of oil, gas, and 
coal.

The latest Green Book calls for $4.7 trillion in new tax increases, 
which will fall on a wide range of industries, as well as workers. 
These tax hikes alone will deliver a heavy blow to energy production 
while simultaneously suppressing growth in numerous sectors of the 
economy. The administration decided to go even further in imposing 
additional burdens on energy producers by deleting virtually every 
longstanding tax provision in the Internal Revenue Code designed to 
support traditional energy production. Specifically, the Green Book 
calls for more than $100 billion in targeted tax increases on fossil 
fuels.

What is most troubling is that the administration explicitly 
acknowledges its intention to chill investment in conventional energy 
production, stating, ``These oil, gas, and coal tax preferences distort 
markets by encouraging more investment in the fossil fuel sector than 
would occur under a neutral system. This market distortion is 
detrimental to long-term energy security and is also inconsistent with 
the administration's policy of supporting a clean energy economy, 
reducing our reliance on oil and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.'' 
It is alarming that the administration believes utilizing our Nation's 
abundant natural resources will be detrimental to long-term energy 
security. Unbelievably, the administration would willingly suppress 
domestic energy production knowing it means fewer jobs and higher 
prices for the American people. The Green Book proposals are neither 
policy neutral nor do they give proper consideration to the fact that 
fossil fuels are the highest taxed industry in the world, and pay 
relatively high rates of tax to the Federal Government--as well as 
State and local governments.

Many of the President's targeted tax hikes would repeal cost recovery 
provisions and deny necessary and ordinary deductions which give energy 
producers parity with other sectors of the economy. One example of this 
is the proposed repeal for the expensing of Intangible Drilling Costs 
(IDCs), which are widely utilized by independent producers to deduct 
expenses related to drilling. These expenses include labor, site 
preparation, repairs, equipment rentals, and survey work. Oftentimes 
these items represent between 60 and 80 percent of total production 
costs.

Another important cost recovery mechanism the administration seeks to 
eliminate is Percentage Depletion. This is a type of depreciation for 
mineral-based assets that allows for a deduction from taxable income to 
reflect the declining production of reserves over time. Percentage 
Depletion is in line with standard depreciation for other assets and is 
necessary to recover costs associated with maintaining production on 
marginal wells, mines, and deposits. The entities benefitting from 
Percentage Depletion are often independent and family-owned production 
companies, as well as farmers and ranchers who may rely on small 
royalty payments.

There are more than a dozen other related energy tax provisions in the 
cross hairs of the administration's tax plan, all of which pale in 
comparison to the lavish subsidies afforded to the renewable energy 
industry. These proposals undermine the very industry responsible for 
providing 80 percent of the Nation's energy needs. The administration 
is attacking the industry providing our allies with an alternative to 
relying on and lining the pockets of dictators in Russia, Iran, and 
Venezuela. These totalitarian regimes do not produce, or refine, with 
the same environmental standards we see with American-made energy.

America is fortunate to have abundant energy resources. Our Nation 
needs to be focused on unleashing American energy and innovation 
instead of throwing away one of our biggest economic and geopolitical 
advantages. When facing a whole-of-government assault, American energy 
producers cannot continue to make long-term investments, which provide 
stability and energy security both at home and overseas. These crushing 
tax proposals, paired with the administration's heavy handed 
regulations and mandates, would threaten American families' access to 
affordable and reliable energy, while giving our adversaries the upper-
hand in the global energy markets.

Sincerely,

RE:  Beneficial Ownership Information Access and Safeguards, and Use of 
FinCEN Identifiers for Entities
     Docket Number: FINCEN-2021-0005; RJN: 1506-AB49/AB59; Document 
Number: 2022-27031

Dear Director Das,

We write in response to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's 
(FinCEN) notice of proposed rulemaking regarding ``Beneficial Ownership 
Information Access and Safeguards, and Use of FinCEN Identifiers for 
Entities.'' This rulemaking is an important step in implementing the 
bipartisan Corporate Transparency Act (CTA),\1\ part of the Anti-Money 
Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act), which was enacted into law as a piece 
of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.\2\ 
While we appreciate the time and effort you have put into the 
implementation of this critical law, we have concerns that this 
proposed rule strays from congressional intent and erects unnecessary 
and costly barriers to accessing beneficial ownership information (BOI) 
that risk undermining the utility of the beneficial ownership 
directory. We encourage you to revise the rule to ensure it tracks 
closer to the text of the statute, remove excessive barriers to 
accessing the directory by authorized recipients, and enhance the 
utility of the directory.

Enacted at the end of the 116th Congress, the CTA is the product of a 
sensitive and painstaking legislative process, and its passage 
represents perhaps the most important anti-money laundering reform in 2 
decades. ``For years, experts routinely ranked anonymous shell 
companies--where the true, `beneficial' owners are unknown--as the 
biggest weakness in our anti-money laundering safeguards.''\3\ The CTA 
directly tackled this problem by requiring FinCEN to create a national 
directory of beneficial owners of companies within the United 
States,\4\ bolstering our nation's efforts to combat ``money 
laundering, the financing of terrorism, proliferation finance, tax 
evasion, human and drug trafficking, sanctions evasion, and other 
financial crimes.''\5\ Despite its legislative success, this 
achievement can only be realized if the system works in practice. To 
that end, we offer the following recommendations.

Access and Use

State, Local, and Tribal Law Enforcement
While we appreciate that the proposed rule aligns with congressional 
intent by ensuring that law enforcement is defined to include the 
enforcement of both civil and criminal law,\6\ we have concerns that 
the proposed access procedures for State, local, and Tribal (SLT) law 
enforcement create excessive and costly barriers that were considered 
and rejected by Congress before enactment of the CTA. As drafted, the 
proposed rule would require SLT law enforcement to obtain ``a court 
order'' before requesting BOI from FinCEN.\7\ Lawmakers debated such a 
requirement,\8\ but Congress ultimately rejected that language in favor 
of granting access to any ``State, local, or Tribal law enforcement 
agency, if a court of competent jurisdiction, including any officer of 
such a court, has authorized the law enforcement agency to seek the 
information in a criminal or civil investigation.''\9\ Legislators were 
clear that, while approval from a `` `Court of competent jurisdiction,' 
for purposes of this measure,'' required sign-off from a lawyer, it was 
not limited to a court order from a judge--but rather encompassed 
authorization from ``an officer of such a court such as a judge, 
magistrate, or a Clerk of Courts.''\10\ The final rule should hew to 
congressional intent in this regard.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use of FinCEN Identifiers for Entities, 87 Fed. Reg. 77404, 77454 
(proposed December 16, 2022) (to be codified at 31 CFR pt. 1010).
    \7\ 87 Fed. Reg. at 77456.
    \8\ For example, the House Financial Services Committee considered 
and rejected an amendment seeking to require State, local, and Tribal 
agencies to obtain a ``court-issued subpoena or warrant'' before 
accessing the beneficial ownership directory. Corporate Transparency 
Act of 2019: Markup of H.R. 2513 Before the House Committee on 
Financial Services, 116th Congress (June 11, 2019) (``An amendment 
offered by Mr. Davidson, no. 2d, was NOT AGREED TO by a record vote of 
25 ayes and 29 nays.''), https://democrats-financialservices.house.gov/
events/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=403829.
    \9\ 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5336(c)(2)(B)(i)(II). Congress's decision to 
allow clerks to approve access should be viewed as a one-off, due to 
the relative insensitivity of this business data, and should not be 
viewed as congressional approval for court clerks to be able to 
authorize access to more intrusive surveillance authorities for which 
authorization has been traditionally entrusted to judges.
    \10\ H.R. Rep. No. 116-617, at 2140 (2020)(Conf. Rep.).

We also have concerns that the proposed rule deviates from 
congressional intent by requiring SLT law enforcement agencies to file 
additional information with FinCEN after obtaining authorization from a 
court of competent jurisdiction that needlessly risks complicating and 
slowing investigations.\11\ Moreover, asking FinCEN to collect and 
manually review extra information from SLT law enforcement agencies 
that was not mandated by the statute is likely to overwhelm FinCEN's 
capacities, thereby undermining the usefulness of the directory and 
conflicting with the clear purpose of the CTA. As such, we request that 
the final rule remove these additional barriers to accessing the 
directory.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ 87 Fed. Reg. at 77456.

Additionally, we recommend amending the proposed 31 CFR 
Sec. 1010.955(b)(2) to ensure the ability to use BOI in court cases 
following the conclusion of any related investigation.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\ 87 Fed. Reg. at 77454.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Financial Institutions
As drafted, this proposed rule risks impeding financial institutions' 
timely access to the beneficial ownership directory. Once the database 
is live, financial institutions across the country will immediately 
begin requesting access to BOI for the 32 million reporting companies 
in the country.\13\ It is essential that FinCEN establish an automated 
process (ideally one that integrates with existing compliance systems 
at financial institutions) for fielding and responding to these 
requests. If FinCEN manually reviews every request from each financial 
institution, it risks overwhelming the capacity of the agency, 
generating major delays in the financial system, and undermining the 
utility of the directory.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ See 87 Fed. Reg. at 77408.

We also urge FinCEN to clarify in the final rule that financial 
institutions are not expected to affirmatively obtain new consent from 
an existing reporting company customer each time a financial 
institution needs to query the directory for information on such 
customer--assuming the customer previously provided the financial 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
institution with its consent to request BOI from FinCEN.

Finally, the proposed rule deviates from congressional intent by 
inappropriately restricting financial institution access to and use of 
BOI.\14\ The current proposal could be read to forbid financial 
institutions from accessing the directory to assist with most of their 
Bank Secrecy Act, anti-fraud, and sanctions screening requirements. 
Congress intended that the directory be ``highly useful'' to financial 
institutions, among other authorized users, and the CTA explicitly 
contemplates that financial institutions will incorporate BOI into 
their AML/CFT programs.\15\ Further, Congress was clear that the 
purpose of the legislation was to combat the abuse of anonymous 
companies writ large, including their use in sanctions evasion, 
financial fraud, and myriad other illicit activity.\16\ Since 
enactment, Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has only amplified the 
importance of the CTA, especially with regards to sanctions 
enforcement. While this proposed rule would provide national security, 
law enforcement, and intelligence agencies with critical information to 
aid federal implementation of sanctions against Putin and his 
oligarchs, financial institutions may continue to struggle to screen 
customers against sanctions lists if they are forbidden from accessing 
the BOI directory for that purpose. This undermines the law and should 
be changed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Treasury OIG and GAO
The draft rule drifts from the statute by failing to provide explicit 
access to two key bodies tasked with conducting congressionally-
mandated audits, studies, and investigations regarding the beneficial 
ownership directory: the Department of the Treasury's Office of 
Inspector General (OIG) and the Comptroller General of the United 
States.

The Inspector General and OIG staff are mandated with ``official 
duties'' by the CTA to field complaints and comments regarding the 
beneficial ownership directory, conduct investigations related to such 
complaints and comments or with regard to any cybersecurity breaches of 
the directory, and submit reports to Congress summarizing such 
complaints and comments, detailing the findings of such investigations, 
and providing critical policy recommendations.\17\ The proposed 31 CFR 
Sec. 1010.955(b)(5) would authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to 
provide access to any ``officers and employees of the Department of the 
Treasury whose official duties the Secretary determines require such 
inspection or disclosure.''\18\ However, the proposed rule does not 
explicitly address the unique role of the Inspector General, 
potentially causing confusion. As such, we encourage you to update the 
rule to provide explicit access for OIG in accordance with the statute.

Further, the AML Act instructs the Comptroller General of the United 
States and employees of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) with 
conducting multiple audits and studies related to the beneficial 
ownership directory.\19\ Congress clearly intended for Treasury to 
grant the Comptroller General and GAO employees access to the directory 
for their official duties related to these audits and studies, but the 
proposed rule includes no mention of either the Comptroller General or 
GAO. We urge you to clarify appropriate Comptroller General and GAO 
access in the final rule.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verification

We are concerned that the proposed rule does not implement the 
congressional mandate that FinCEN ensure that beneficial ownership 
information reported to FinCEN be accurate, complete, and highly useful 
by implementing appropriate verification mechanisms. We urge you to 
ensure any final rule and the processes pursuant to which BOI is 
collected and maintained include verification.

In drafting the CTA, Congress was aware of deficiencies limiting the 
utility of the information collected by certain foreign beneficial 
ownership directories which did not verify reported information.\20\ As 
such, Congress explicitly stated that one of the purposes of the CTA 
was to ``bring the United States into compliance with international 
anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism 
standards;''\21\ such standards define ``accurate'' BOI as 
``information, which has been verified to confirm its accuracy by 
verifying the identity and status of the beneficial owner using 
reliable, independently sourced/obtained documents, data or 
information.''\22\ Accordingly, the statute requires Treasury, on its 
own and coordinating with other relevant federal, state, and tribal 
agencies, to implement BOI verification mechanisms.\23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \20\ See, e.g., Curbing Corruption Through Corporate Transparency 
and Collaboration: The British Model: Briefing of the Commission on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, 116th Congress (May 29, 2019).
    \21\ Sec. 1A6402(5)(E), 134 Stat. at 4604-4605.

fatf-recommendations-2012-updated-october-2020/file.
    \23\ 31 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 5336(d)(1)-(2).

Moreover, it is critical that this verification process be automated 
and built into the BOI reporting process. If FinCEN were to manually 
verify every submission of BOI, it risks overwhelming the capacity of 
the agency, generating major inefficiencies for reporting companies, 
and delaying access to accurate, complete, and highly useful BOI for 
authorized recipients.

Outreach, Templates, and Step-by-Step Guides

As you move forward with the implementation of the CTA, we urge you to 
create clear, concise templates and forms for requesting and accessing 
the BOI directory tailored to each type of authorized recipient. We 
also encourage FinCEN to create clear and concise training videos and 
step-by-step guides tailored to each type of authorized recipient of 
BOI explaining in plain language how to go about requesting and 
accessing BOI information from FinCEN. The CTA will only achieve its 
goals if appropriate users know how to access BOI and feel confident in 
their ability to access the directory within the confines of the law.

We commend FinCEN for your work to implement this historic legislation. 
Pending consideration of our feedback, we look forward to the swift 
implementation of the beneficial ownership information directory.

CC: The Honorable Janet Yellen, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury

                                 ______
                                 
                 Prepared Statement of Hon. Ron Wyden, 
                       a U.S. Senator From Oregon
    This morning the Finance Committee welcomes Treasury Secretary 
Janet Yellen for a hearing on the President's budget proposal.

    Everyone here, regardless of political stripe, understands that the 
FDIC, the Fed, and the Treasury Department are putting in long hours to 
contain the fallout of the recent bank closures. The process is moving 
forward under existing law.

    Investigations are underway at the SEC and Department of Justice. 
Senator Brown, chair of the Banking Committee and a valued member of 
this committee, is determined to get to the bottom of exactly what went 
wrong.

    Nerves are frayed at the moment. One of the most important steps 
the Congress can take now is make sure there are no questions about the 
full faith and credit of the United States. That means paying the bills 
incurred by Presidents of both parties and taking a default off the 
table.

    With respect to the budget debate, after a request from me and 
Senator Whitehouse, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office did the 
math on the recent fiscal promises we've heard from House Republicans. 
Those promises are piling up, but their numbers aren't adding up. They 
want to balance the budget in 10 years, but they've announced a long 
list of untouchables. No reductions in defense spending. No cuts to 
Medicare or Social Security. No touching veterans' programs. No asking 
the wealthy or corporations to pay a penny more in taxes. A couple of 
those items would get bipartisan support, but certainly not all of 
them.

    Senator Whitehouse and I asked the CBO to run the numbers. Is it 
even possible for Republicans to stand by all those commitments? Does 
the math add up? The short answer is ``no.'' Not even close.

    What CBO found is that for Republicans to make the math work, they 
would have to cut every other Federal program by 86 percent. Goodbye to 
Medicaid and the guarantee of nursing home coverage. The border would 
be unprotected. Roads and bridges would crumble back into the stone 
age. And if Republicans also want to extend the Trump tax law, then 
you'd have to cut everything else. Gone.

    Given that, it's not a big mystery why House Republicans haven't 
yet put a budget on paper to show to the American people. They're 
living way out in la-la land.

    Democrats are following a smarter approach. The President has put 
out a budget that's based on a simple proposition: helping working 
families and the middle class get ahead and reducing the deficit at the 
same time are not mutually exclusive.

    There are a few budget items I want to highlight that are relevant 
to the Treasury.

    First, last week this committee held an excellent hearing on the 
affordable housing crisis. That's an area where I believe there's a 
clear opportunity for bipartisan cooperation in this Congress. The 
budget proposes expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and 
creating the Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, among other ideas. Senator 
Cantwell, Senator Cardin, and Senator Young are championing our efforts 
here. I'm going to continue to work with them on these proposals and 
more. This crisis needs a solution, and there's no substitute for 
increasing the supply of affordable housing.

    Second, the budget calls for expanding two of the most significant 
sources of support for working people and families: the Child Tax 
Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit. When the Congress passed those 
expansions in 2021, there were huge, almost immediate reductions in 
poverty. With a little financial relief, millions of working Americans 
felt like they could finally breathe for the first time in a long time. 
I'd like for them to have that feeling of relief once again.

    And third, I've talked for a long time about the need to address 
the basic unfairness of our two-tiered tax system. There's one set of 
rules for people who work for a living--teachers, nurses, and 
firefighters--who pay taxes straight out of every paycheck. Then 
there's another set of rules for the uber-wealthy, who can pay what 
they want, when they want, and potentially nothing at all. Although the 
President and I have proposed slightly different ideas for addressing 
this unfairness, it's clear we're rowing in the same direction.

    One final issue before I wrap up. I've got serious concerns about 
the approach the administration has taken to implementing the portion 
of the Inflation Reduction Act that deals with sourcing critical 
minerals. Free trade agreements cannot be unilaterally decided by the 
executive branch. They require consultation and consent from Congress. 
That includes any agreements on critical minerals.

    I want to thank Secretary Yellen for joining the committee today.

                                 ______
                                 
              Prepared Statement of Hon. Janet L. Yellen, 
                 Secretary, Department of the Treasury
    Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of the committee, 
thank you for inviting me here today.

    I'd like to begin with an update on the recent developments in the 
banking system. This week, the government took decisive and forceful 
actions to strengthen public confidence in our banking system.

    First, we worked with the Federal Reserve and FDIC to protect all 
depositors of the two failed banks. On Monday morning, customers were 
able to access all of the money in their deposit accounts so they could 
make payroll and pay the bills. Shareholders and debt holders are not 
being protected by the government. Importantly, no taxpayer money is 
being used or put at risk with this action. Deposit protection is 
provided by the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is funded by fees on 
banks. Second, the Federal Reserve is providing additional support to 
the banking system with a new lending facility. This will help 
financial institutions meet the needs of all of their depositors.

    I can reassure the members of the committee that our banking system 
remains sound, and that Americans can feel confident that their 
deposits will be there when they need them. This week's actions 
demonstrate our resolute commitment to ensure that depositors' savings 
remain safe.

    Now, let me turn to the topic of this hearing: the President's 
Fiscal Year 2024 budget.

    Over the past 2 years, the United States has experienced a historic 
economic recovery. In January 2021, our country was in the middle of an 
economic calamity triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. But Congress 
and the President took decisive action through the American Rescue Plan 
and our vaccination campaign. Today, our unemployment rate is near 
historic lows. And we've seen the strongest 2 years of business 
creation in history.

    Now our task is to navigate our economy's transition from rapid 
recovery to sustainable growth. This includes bringing down inflation. 
We have seen some moderation in headline inflation, but more work needs 
to be done. Our administration will continue to build on the actions 
we've taken to expand supply and provide cost relief in areas like 
energy and health care.

    With your partnership, we've also laid a foundation for long-term 
economic growth. In just the past 2 years alone, Congress passed three 
transformational laws: a generational investment in infrastructure; a 
historic expansion of American semiconductor manufacturing; and the 
largest investment in clean energy in our Nation's history.

    A strategic priority for our administration this year is to work 
with you to effectively implement these laws. We are seeing the early 
results. In just 7 months, there's been a wave of investments in clean 
energy manufacturing across the country. And our new resources for the 
IRS are already paying off. Taxpayers are getting drastically improved 
customer service this year. For example, we've answered hundreds of 
thousands more phone calls during this filing season than at this time 
last year.

    Our proposed budget builds on our economic progress by making 
smart, fiscally responsible investments. These investments would be 
more than fully paid for by requiring corporations and the wealthiest 
to pay their fair share. Fiscal discipline remains a central priority 
in our budget. We've proposed a minimum income tax of 25 percent on 
taxpayers with wealth in excess of $100 million. We've also proposed an 
increase of the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from the current 21 
percent. And it will come as no surprise that I hope Congress will 
implement the United States' part of the global minimum tax deal.

    On the spending side, we suggest additional investments to boost 
our long-term growth potential. This includes improving the 
availability of high-quality child care, providing free and universal 
pre-school, and boosting the supply of affordable housing. We also 
propose restoring the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit 
expansions that were enacted in 2021 but have since expired. 
Importantly, with the proposed tax reforms, we estimate that this 
budget will deliver deficit reduction of nearly $3 trillion over the 
next 10 years.

    Thank you, and I look forward to taking your questions.

       Questions Submitted for the Record to Hon. Janet L. Yellen
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
    Question. President Biden is absolutely right when he says that the 
tax system in America is deeply unfair. There's one set of rules that 
apply to workers who pay out of every paycheck and there's another set 
of rules that lets billionaires pay what they want, when they want. I 
am glad to see the President agrees that we need to put an end to two 
tax codes and has built on my Billionaires Income Tax with his own tax 
on billionaires.

    The administration's analysis found the top 400 billionaires paid 
just 8.2 percent in tax on average.


    How does the current tax system allow billionaires to pay so little 
in tax, and how do proposals like mine and the President's billionaires 
proposals make billionaires finally pay their fair share?

    Answer. Under current law, some of the wealthiest Americans pay 
very little tax because they receive their income as capital gains, 
which are not taxed until realized and may escape income taxation 
entirely at death.

    The President's budget would impose a minimum tax of 25 percent on 
total income, inclusive of unrealized capital gains. It would apply to 
the wealthiest 0.01 percent, taxpayers with more than $100 million in 
wealth. This proposal would put an end to the situation that exists 
today, in which wealthy households borrow against their wealth and use 
that borrowed money to finance a lavish lifestyle while at the same 
time reporting that their wealth generates little income for tax 
purposes.

    Your proposal for a billionaires income tax would address the same 
root problem using a different approach: marking-to-market the value of 
publicly traded assets every year and imposing a deferral charge on 
other assets. It would also put an end to the problem of wealthy 
taxpayers with large investment gains reporting little income for tax 
purposes.

    Question. President Biden has put out a budget that reduces the 
deficit by nearly $3 trillion. Meanwhile Republicans continue to push 
to make Trump's 2017 tax cut for the rich permanent, which would only 
add to the deficit over time.

    How much would making the 2017 tax law permanent add to the 
deficit, and what percentage of the tax cuts would go to just the top 1 
percent of households?

    Answer. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that making 
permanent the individual and estate tax provisions of the TCJA would 
cost $2.6 trillion over the next decade. According to the Tax Policy 
Center, about one-fifth of the individual and estate tax cuts would go 
to the top 1 percent.

                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Mike Crapo
    Question. When outstanding debt was approaching the statutory limit 
of $31.4 trillion in January, you told Congress that Treasury was ``not 
currently able to provide an estimate of how long extraordinary 
measures will enable us to continue to pay the government's 
obligations.'' Since that time, the non-partisan Congressional Budget 
Office (CBO) has estimated how long the government can pay the bills 
and projected the X-Date between July and September 2023. Private 
forecasters have concurred, but note the uncertainly in tax revenue, 
such as filings in April.

    When will Treasury be able to provide a more accurate X-Date range 
to Congress?

    Answer. I wrote to congressional leaders on January 13, 2023 and 
communicated that although the period of time that extraordinary 
measures would last is subject to considerable uncertainty, it was 
``unlikely that cash and extraordinary measures [would] be exhausted 
before early June.''\1\ When the government reached the debt limit on 
January 19, 2023, Treasury sent a further notification to congressional 
leaders \2\ and also posted online a detailed description of the 
extraordinary measures Treasury was considering using during the debt 
limit impasse.\3\

    Treasury committed to keep Congress informed as we approached the 
exhaustion of our resources, and we sent letters to congressional 
leaders on May 1st, May 15th, May 22nd, and May 26th underscoring the 
importance of raising or suspending the debt limit by early June. Debt 
limit projections from other organizations were generally consistent 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
with Treasury's estimates.

    Treasury's estimates were based on data and projections regarding 
Federal receipts, outlays, and debt. As early June approached, Treasury 
posted online detailed information regarding outstanding debt subject 
to the limit and the amounts of remaining extraordinary resources.\4\ 
This information was in addition to the Daily Treasury Statement, which 
provides information on Treasury's cash and debt operations for the 
Federal Government.\5\ As the information shows, by June 1st, 
Treasury's cash balance had fallen below $23 billion, indicating 
considerable risks to the Federal Government's ability to continue to 
satisfy all of its obligations, and available resources continued to 
decline over the following days.

    Question. President Biden pledged that no American earning less 
than $400,000 would see any of their taxes increase while he is 
President. During your testimony to the Finance Committee, Senator 
Young asked you to provide a list of TCJA tax rates or other 
provisions, that if allowed to sunset after 2025, would increase taxes 
on taxpayers earning less than $400,000 a year, in violation of the 
President's pledge. In your response to Senator Young, you stated, ``I 
don't know that I can provide you with that. . . . I think that it is a 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
very complex exercise, and I'm not sure.''

    If Congress is to engage in sincere discussions with the President 
and his team about these important provisions, and take him at his word 
about the clear red line he has issued publicly many times when it 
comes to Americans earning less than $400,000, then it is essential 
that members of Congress on both sides have a clear understanding of 
exactly where the President's red line exists when it comes to all 
expiring TCJA rates and provisions. Understanding there may be 
complexities involved makes it even more essential that Congress can 
receive clarity from you on how the administration views each and every 
one of these TCJA provisions with regard to the President's pledge.

    Please provide a list of TCJA tax rate or other provisions that if 
allowed to sunset after 2025 would increase taxes on taxpayers earning 
less than $400,000 a year, in violation of the President's pledge.

    Answer. The TCJA is a complex piece of legislation with many 
interrelated parts, including both gross tax increases and tax cuts. 
The net effect of the expiring provisions on a household depends on how 
all expiring provisions are addressed. The President will work with the 
Congress to address the 2025 expiration of portions of the TCJA, and 
focus tax policy on rewarding work not wealth, based on the following 
guiding principles. The President:

          Opposes increasing taxes on people earning less than 
        $400,000 and supports cutting taxes for working people and 
        families with children to give them more breathing room;
          Opposes cutting taxes for the wealthy--either extending tax 
        cuts for the wealthy or bringing back tax breaks that would 
        benefit the wealthy; and
          Supports additional reforms to ensure that wealthy people 
        and big corporations pay their fair share, so that America pays 
        for the continuation of tax cuts for people earning less than 
        $400,000 in a fiscally responsible manner and address the 
        problematic sunsets created by President Trump and 
        congressional Republicans.

    Question. In testimony to the House Committee on Ways and Means, 
you stated that ``the European Union has adopted it [meaning, the 
Pillar 2 regime] and other countries are moving forward--Japan, the 
United Kingdom, Singapore--many countries are going forward with this 
so the issue of our going first and will others follow no longer 
exists.'' Yet, your proposal to apply the Under-Taxed Profits Rule, or 
UTPR, follows a conventional revenue estimating methodology that looks 
at whether other countries have adopted the Pillar 2 rules into 
domestic law. The result is a more than half a trillion dollar revenue 
estimate of imposing a UTPR because other countries have not officially 
adopted the Pillar 2 rules into law.

    To confirm, does your UTPR revenue estimate assume that no other 
country has implemented the Pillar 2 regime?

    However, if other countries are moving forward with implementing 
Pillar 2, as you have indicated they are, is the UTPR revenue that 
actually could be collected by the U.S. much less than what you have 
included in your revenue estimate?

    Answer. The revenue estimate for the UTPR was done following 
longstanding revenue estimating conventions and is consistent with the 
policies of foreign countries at a given point in time. The estimate 
would change as foreign countries enact Pillar 2.

    Question. In response to last year's questions for the record 
(QFRs), you responded that Treasury has briefed members of Congress and 
their staff numerous times on the OECD agreement and that there has 
been meaningful consultation. In reality, you have briefed Senate 
Finance members only once--in 2021--on the OECD agreement and there has 
been no meaningful consultation. Treasury has also repeatedly declined 
to answer our questions regarding the revenue effect of the agreement, 
the impact on American companies and U.S. tax incentives, like the 
research and development tax credit, and the treaty implications of the 
agreement. The lack of transparency and consultation with Congress is 
particularly concerning given the assurances Treasury has made to other 
countries that the U.S. will implement the agreement. Treasury would be 
wise to remember that Congress has sole tax-writing authority, not the 
administration.

    Please provide the dates that Treasury has formally briefed members 
of Congress, as well as congressional staff members.

    Answer. Congressional input on the OECD agreement continues to be a 
priority for Treasury. Our Office of Tax Policy staff has briefed 
congressional staff on a bipartisan, bicameral basis throughout the 
negotiations on the agreement. Congressional input has been valuable in 
developing our negotiating positions and is ultimately reflected in the 
substance of the current agreement.

    Question. Will you commit to formally briefing Senate Finance 
members at least quarterly on OECD negotiations?

    Answer. My tax policy staff would be pleased to brief members on 
the OECD negotiations when invited to do so.

                                 ______
                                 
               Questions Submitted by Hon. John Barrasso
    Question. The Green Book proposals contain numerous provisions 
targeting fossil fuels production. With roughly $100 billion in total 
tax increases on energy production, $31 billion falls squarely on 
domestic production. The vast majority of which is cost recovery 
including: expensing for intangible drilling costs, depletion, 
geological and geophysical amortization, etc. Furthermore, the FY 2024 
tax proposals says that ``. . . oil, gas, and coal tax preferences 
distort markets by encouraging more investment in the fossil fuel 
sector than would occur under a neutral system.''

    Is this an admission that the administration is intentionally 
aiming to limit investment in domestic energy production of oil, gas, 
and coal? Has the administration given consideration to the impact that 
this could have on energy prices and job creation, particularly workers 
in the energy sector? Does the administration believe that less 
production of energy is a positive for American families and our allies 
around the world? Would taxpayers, or royalty owners, that makes less 
than $400,000 be impacted, including through higher effective tax 
rates, from some of these repeals?

    Answer. The President's FY 2024 budget proposes to eliminate 
certain special tax preferences for fossil fuel industries. As the 
Green Book emphasizes, those special subsidies are detrimental to long-
term energy security and inconsistent with the administration's policy 
of supporting a clean energy economy, reducing our reliance on oil, and 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the investments made in 
clean energy industries in the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce 
energy costs for families, strengthen our energy and national security, 
reduce harmful emissions, and create jobs and economic opportunity.

    Question. The Green Book proposals include the repeal of stepped-up 
basis as well as other changes to capital gains, estate, and gift 
taxation. The changes proposed create what would be a new 
``supercharged death tax.''

    Does the administration have any concerns that echo those of the 
small business community and family-owned farms and ranch operations 
regarding the forced sale of assets, massive complexity, and high tax 
burdens? Does the administration have specific language to ensure that 
family businesses will be protected? How complex might those proposals 
be?

    Answer. The stepped-up basis loophole allows some investment gains 
to escape income taxation forever. The proposal to reform the taxation 
of capital income in the President's budget would address this loophole 
and also tax capital income for high-income earners at ordinary rates, 
ensuring more equal treatment of labor and capital income.

    The proposal would exclude any gain on tangible personal property 
(excluding collectibles). The $250,000 per-person exclusion under 
current law for capital gain on a principal residence would apply to 
all residences and would be portable to the decedent's surviving 
spouse, making the exclusion effectively $500,000 per couple. Finally, 
the exclusion under current law for capital gain on certain small 
business stock would also apply.

    In addition to the above exclusions, the proposal would allow a $5 
million per-donor exclusion from recognition of other unrealized 
capital gains on property transferred by gift during life. This 
exclusion would apply only to unrealized appreciation on gifts to the 
extent that the donor's cumulative total of lifetime gifts exceeds the 
basic exclusion amount in effect at the time of the gift. In addition, 
the proposal would allow any remaining portion of the $5 million 
exclusion that has not been used during life as an exclusion from 
recognition of other unrealized capital gains on property transferred 
by reason of death. This exclusion would be portable to the decedent's 
surviving spouse under the same rules that apply to portability for 
estate and gift tax purposes (resulting in a married couple having an 
aggregate $10 million exclusion) and would be indexed for inflation 
after 2023.

    The proposal also includes several deferral elections. Taxpayers 
could elect not to recognize unrealized appreciation of certain family-
owned and -operated businesses until the interest in the business is 
sold or the business ceases to be family-owned and -operated. 
Furthermore, the proposal would allow a 15-year fixed-rate payment plan 
for the tax on appreciated assets transferred at death, other than 
liquid assets such as publicly traded financial assets and other than 
businesses for which the deferral election is made.

    Question. There are many families who typically make far below 
$400,000 each year, absent a one-time life event, like the death of a 
parent.

    Would a middle-class family in that situation, who has a one-time 
windfall, be subject to the repeal of stepped-up basis, capital gains 
rates of 39.6 percent (before other additional surtaxes are included), 
and a taxable event from the loss of a family member?

    Answer. The proposal to treat transfers of appreciated property by 
gift or on death as realization events would only apply to donors that 
have more than $5 million of untaxed investment gains per donor (i.e., 
more than $10 million of untaxed investments for a married couple). The 
proposal to tax capital income at ordinary rates only applies to 
taxpayers with income in excess of $1 million.

    Question. Starting in 2022, a stricter interest expense limitation 
(163(j)) went into effect that essentially acts as a tax on job 
creating investments. In fact, a recent study shows that a failure to 
reverse this stricter limit on interest deductibility could cost the 
economy nearly half a million jobs. This is also a competitiveness 
issue in that the U.S. is a global outlier in the tax treatment of 
interest expense.

    Will the administration support reversing this harmful policy in 
order to help ensure America remains a welcome home for job creating 
investments?

    Answer. Under section 163(j), which was enacted as part of the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), most large businesses' net interest expense 
deductions are limited to 30 percent of their ``adjusted taxable 
income.'' Under the TCJA, adjusted taxable income was initially based 
on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization 
(EBITDA), but for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, 
adjusted taxable income is based on earnings before interest and tax 
(EBIT).\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ 26 U.S.C. Sec. 163(j)(8)(A)(v).

    Because this stricter interest expense limitation is required by 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
statute, it can only be changed by congressional action.

    The Treasury stands ready to work with Congress on this topic and 
to implement any legislation that is enacted.

    Question. The previous administration had taken the position that 
our current GILTI regime should be deemed compliant with the OECD 
agreement. In 2021, Treasury abandoned this posture.

    Why was the change in America's interest, and what, if anything, 
did we get in exchange?

    Answer. There was never any agreement at the OECD that our current 
GILTI regime would be treated as compliant with the Pillar 2 framework; 
rather the agreement ensures that taxes paid under our current GILTI 
regime will be taken into account in determining whether the income of 
U.S. subsidiaries is subject to a minimum rate of tax. Pillar 2 serves 
the important goal of leveling the playing field for U.S. businesses, 
while also protecting U.S. workers and middle-class families by ending 
the race to the bottom in corporate tax rates. It will create a system 
under which foreign corporations will face minimum taxes wherever they 
do business, just like U.S. businesses do today. By leveling the 
playing field, it will create a system in which U.S. businesses will be 
more competitive than they are now.

    Question. Despite having negotiated for a minimum tax of 15 
percent, the Green Book proposes that U.S. companies must pay 21 
percent, not including technical aspects of the foreign tax credit 
regime that pushes the rate to more than 22 percent. Treasury has held 
the position when asked this question that having a global minimum tax 
would be a better situation for U.S. companies than what we have now. 
But in talking to taxpayers affected by the proposal, it's clear they 
don't see it that way--they see the administration proposing a regime 
that uniquely disadvantages U.S. companies and the workers they employ. 
They would much prefer the current system to the one you have proposed.

    If you claim that the rest of the world is finally catching up to 
the U.S., why would Treasury suddenly propose higher tax rates for U.S. 
companies compared to their foreign competitors, along with more 
punitive rules, when foreign countries finally move closer to adopting 
a global minimum tax structure? Additionally, what percentage of the 
revenue collected in a Pillar 2 minimum tax regime would be collected 
from U.S. companies by foreign jurisdictions?

    Answer. U.S. companies are currently subject to a minimum tax 
regime that their foreign competitors are not, and despite that 
difference, the United States remains a desirable jurisdiction in which 
to operate, and U.S. businesses thrive. We have confidence that under 
the proposals in the administration's Green Book, when combined with 
the worldwide adoption of the OECD framework, U.S. businesses will be 
better off than they are currently.

    Treasury revenue estimates are done following long-standing revenue 
estimating conventions and are consistent with the policies of foreign 
countries at a given point in time. When another jurisdiction adopts 
the UTPR, our UTPR proposal would ensure that the U.S. collects its 
share of the tax revenue. Taken together our UTPR proposal combined 
with our reformed GILTI proposal minimize the potential for foreign 
jurisdictions to collect Pillar 2 minimum tax from U.S. companies.

    Question. The Green Book Proposes to increase the corporate rate 
from 21 percent to 28 percent. This is in addition to the recently 
enacted corporate alternative minimum tax. The previous rate was 35 
percent, the highest in the OECD. Moving away from a 35-percent rate 
put the United States in the middle of the pack in terms of both 
statutory rate and average effective tax rate. Combined with State 
corporate income tax rates, this proposal to increase the rate to 28 
percent would put the United States at the top of OECD once again.

    Has the administration considered what this might do to 
competitiveness, as well as its impact on workers and wages? 
Additionally, has the administration considered the impact it might 
have on small businesses, considering the fact that the vast majority 
of corporations are actually smaller, main street businesses?

    Answer. The administration's revenue proposals would ensure that 
the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share and, in doing 
so, fully pay for the investments proposed in the President's budget 
while generating $2.6 trillion in additional deficit reduction over the 
next decade. In 2019, the most recent year for which data is available, 
active corporations other than those filing Forms 1120S, 1120-REIT, and 
1120-RIC with business receipts of $1 billion or more accounted for 
more than all of the net income reported by such corporations 
regardless of the size of their business receipts.

    Moreover, raising the corporate income tax rate is an 
administratively simple way to raise revenue to pay for the 
administration's fiscal priorities. A significant share of the effects 
of the corporate tax increase would be borne by foreign investors. A 
corporate tax rate increase can also increase the progressivity of the 
tax system and help reduce income inequality. Finally, the majority of 
income from capital investments in domestic C corporations is untaxed 
by the U.S. Government at the shareholder level, so the corporate tax 
is a primary mechanism for taxing such capital income.

    Question. The Green Book proposes changes to the Net Investment 
Income Tax (NIIT) as well as increases to the Medicare payroll tax. 
Specifically, the Green Book would expand the base of the NIIT to apply 
to active pass-through business income, which is often small business 
income, above $400,000 and increase the NIIT and Medicare payroll tax 
rates from 3.8 percent to 5 percent. This proposal will hit, according 
to the National Federation of Independent Businesses, more than 750,000 
pass-through businesses. Combined with other changes in the Green Book, 
as well as average State and local tax rates, small business owners 
would be facing marginal income tax rates of 45.4 percent and capital 
gains rates as high as 49.6 percent. This is far above the OECD 
average, which are 42.6 percent and 18.9 percent respectively. The 
changes to the NIIT and Medicare payroll tax alone equals $650 billion 
in new tax hikes. This does not even include other changes to income 
tax and capital gains rates.

    Does the administration, especially in a time of high inflation, 
economic uncertainty, and rising interest rates, believe an expanded 
tax on small businesses will not have a drastic and adverse impact on 
these pass-through entities and the economy as a whole? Has the 
administration conducted any macroeconomic analysis of this specific 
proposal? If so, what were the findings?

    Answer. The President's budget would extend the life of the 
Medicare Trust Fund by more than 25 years, through a combination of 
fiscally responsible tax reforms and prescription drug savings.

    Active owners of pass-through businesses, including S corporations 
and partnerships, are treated differently for purposes of the Net 
Investment Income Tax (NIIT), Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA) 
tax, and Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax according to 
the legal form of their ownership and the legal form of the payment 
that they receive. While general partners and sole proprietors pay SECA 
tax on earnings from their businesses, S corporation owner-employees 
pay employment taxes on only a portion of their earnings, and limited 
partners often pay little or no SECA tax. Although the NIIT reflects an 
intention to impose the 3.8-percent tax on both earned and unearned 
income of high-income taxpayers, certain income, specifically 
distributions to S corporation shareholder-employees and distributions 
to limited partners who claim the statutory exclusion for limited 
partners, escape the combined 3.8-percent tax from FICA or SECA and the 
NIIT.

    These inconsistencies in the treatment of pass-through business 
income are unfair and inefficient. They distort choice of 
organizational form and provide tax planning opportunities for business 
owners, particularly those with high incomes, to avoid paying their 
fair share of taxes.

    Question. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank were 
created to promote economic growth in developing countries and 
eliminate extreme poverty. Despite having access to capital and being 
the second largest economy in the world, China is still receiving loans 
and assistance from both banks. Since reaching the criteria for 
graduation from lending in 2016, the World Bank approved $9.6 billion 
in projects to China. The Asian Development Bank provided China with 
$10.6 billion in loans and $2.4 billion in non-sovereign commitments in 
China during that same time frame. When I asked Secretary of State 
Blinken about the Biden administration continuing to support these 
loans to China, he said, ``on that specific question, I really have to 
defer to my colleagues at the Treasury Department.''

    Do you believe China is a developing country? Why should American 
taxpayers be supporting lending and financial assistance to China? Do 
you support ending all lending to China at the World Bank and Asian 
Development Bank? Is China engaging in predatory lending to developing 
countries while simultaneously receiving subsidized loans from the 
World Bank and the Asian Development Banks? What is your strategy to 
ensure countries that meet the graduation threshold criteria are no 
longer lending from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank?

    Answer. We support ending all lending to China, and the U.S. 
Executive Directors (USEDs) at both the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) 
oppose all project proposals for China. I believe China meets both of 
those institutions' criteria for graduation, given its high per capita 
income, institutional capacity, and ample access to other sources of 
finance. There is not a formal process for graduating countries from 
IBRD lending, and graduation from IBRD lending is effectively 
voluntary. The ADB's Graduation Policy mirrors the IBRD graduation 
policy and assesses readiness for graduation on three factors: gross 
national income (GNI) per capita, market access, and institutional 
development. China's GNI per capita has been above the IBRD and ADB 
graduation threshold since 2014 and is nearing the threshold to be 
classified by the World Bank as a high-income country. China holds an 
A+ rating from the three major credit rating agencies and score scores 
relatively high on the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators, 
except on the Voice and Accountability metric. China is ready for 
graduation by all accounts.

    China is engaging in predatory lending to developing countries. 
That is why I have instructed our USEDs at the IBRD and ADB to call 
attention to China's predatory lending practices through the voice and 
vote of the United States on the World Bank's board of directors. In 
addition, I have instructed our USEDs to advocate for World Bank 
assistance to countries with building debt management capacity, 
promoting debt transparency through debt data collection and reporting, 
and supporting countries participating in debt relief initiatives, such 
as the G20 Common Framework.

    World Bank Management assesses countries' readiness for graduation 
based on sustained per capita income about the graduation discussion 
income threshold, creditworthiness and access to other sources of 
finance, and institutional capacity. I will continue to press for 
transparency in assessments of graduation readiness and targeting 
assistance on addressing constraints to graduation. In the case of 
China, I will continue to work with the U.S. Executive Directors to the 
World Bank and ADB, as well as others in the U.S. Government to press 
for the PRC's graduation.

    Question. Chinese firms are the largest recipients of World Bank 
contracts. Chinese firms won nearly a quarter of investment projects 
between 2016 and 2020. At the same time, numerous state-owned Chinese 
firms have been disqualified by the World Bank and other multilateral 
development banks for violating procurement policies.

    What are the risks and challenges posed by the World Bank's 
reliance on Chinese firms for implementation of its development 
projects? What is the administration's plan to address this issue?

    Answer. Competition with China is one of the central challenges of 
the 21st century, including competition with China's economic 
statecraft. As we have seen, supply chain diversification is an 
important global priority for numerous reasons. Investments from the 
World Bank to developing countries can help with this effort.

    I will work with President Biden and Congress to continue to shore 
up U.S. leadership in the World Bank so that: (1) the institution 
offers a high-quality, sustainable alternative to borrowing from China; 
(2) there is an emphasis on increasing developing countries' capacity 
to evaluate procurement bids and contracts on the basis of quality and 
life cycle value-for-money; and (3) there are investments in 
responsible efforts at supply chain diversification. I will also 
continue to advocate for robust resourcing for the World Bank's 
Integrity Unit, so that firms and individuals found to have engaged in 
corruption are restricted from MDB procurement opportunities.

    Question. The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced plans to 
end support for fossil fuels at multilateral development bank, except 
for exceptional circumstances.

    What are the ``exceptional circumstances'' in which the United 
States would support a fossil fuel project at the World Bank? What 
actions has the United States taken to end World Bank support for 
fossil fuels?

    Answer. Treasury's fossil fuel guidance for multilateral 
development banks (MDBs) allows support for stand-alone investments in 
certain technologies such as carbon capture, use, and storage (CCUS) 
and methane abatement, provided these investments do not expand the 
capacity of the existing project or a significantly extend its 
operational life. The guidance also allows support for the use of 
natural gas and oil products for household heat generation projects, in 
particular clean cooking projects, if no cleaner options are feasible.

    The fossil fuel guidance at the MDBs also allows narrow support for 
natural gas investments in midstream and downstream projects when 
certain criteria are met. These criteria include: (1) the availability 
of a credible alternatives analysis that demonstrates that there is no 
economically and technically feasible clean energy alternative; (2) the 
project has a significant positive impact on energy security, energy 
access, or development; and (3) the project is aligned with and 
supports the goals of the Paris Agreement.

    The fossil fuel guidance is in addition to, and does not supersede, 
other U.S. policies, considerations, and legislative provisions 
regarding MDB projects.

    The United States has supported projects that meet the guidance.

    Question. At the beginning of this year, the new corporate 
alternative minimum tax (CAMT) has gone into effect. This has created 
tremendous challenges for companies doing business in the United 
States. The provision claws back longstanding, bipartisan provisions of 
the tax code designed to promote domestic investment. Further, the 
provision is immensely complex. One, of many, particular issues facing 
taxpayers is the possibility of double taxation.

    How will Treasury implement the new corporate alternative minimum 
tax to ensure double taxation of income does not occur? Has Treasury 
considered transition rules so that income taxed under the traditional 
corporate tax rules before CAMT was enacted isn't taxed a second time 
under the CAMT due to differences in timing between tax and financial 
statement inclusions?

    Answer. Treasury has received a number of comments from 
stakeholders asking for various forms of transition rules for the CAMT. 
In addition, Treasury has released guidance, including Notice 2023-42, 
which provides relief from penalties for failure to make a sufficient 
and timely payment of estimated income tax in connection with the 
application of the new CAMT. Some of the requested transition rules 
would provide that items of income taxed under the corporate income tax 
rules before CAMT was enacted would be excluded from adjusted financial 
statement income (and therefore would not be taxed under the CAMT due 
to differences in timing between tax and financial statement 
inclusions). Notice 2023-64 provided interim guidance that clarified 
that timing differences between regular tax and CAMT do not give rise 
to duplications or omissions to be addressed by guidance, even if the 
timing difference originated before the effective date of the CAMT and 
reversed after that date. Treasury is considering all comments that are 
provided on this rule, and will address these comments in future 
guidance.

              Questions Submitted by Hon. Marsha Blackburn
    Question. Will Treasury clarify in its guidance for 48(D) the 
eligibility of semiconductor producers, including polysilicon 
manufacturers?

    Answer. Earlier this year, in coordination with the Department of 
Commerce and the Department of Defense, Treasury and the IRS published 
a notice of proposed rulemaking with proposed rules to implement the 
section 48D investment tax credit and the special ``applicable 
transaction'' recapture rule in section 50(a)(3). The NPRM expressly 
requested public comment on issues like the scope of terms like 
``semiconductor,'' and we will carefully consider public feedback and 
work with interagency partners before issuing final rules.

    Question. Can you share with the committee the process by which the 
Treasury is proceeding with issuing guidance for implementing the 48D 
tax credit established in the CHIPS and Science Act and the timeline 
for when guidance will be issued?

    Answer. Earlier this year, in coordination with the Department of 
Commerce and the Department of Defense, Treasury and the IRS published 
a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) containing proposed rules to 
implement the section 48D investment tax credit and the special 
``applicable transaction'' recapture rule in section 50(a)(3). After 
considering all comments received, including through the public hearing 
process, we will coordinate the publication of final regulations with 
the Department of Commerce and the Department of Defense, as required 
by law.

    Question. When were you first notified that there were problems 
with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and when did you first alert members of 
Congress to the unfolding situation?

    Answer. I became aware of issues at Silicon Valley Bank on 
Thursday, March 9th, the week of its failure. In testimony before the 
House Ways and Means Committee the next day, I mentioned that I was 
carefully monitoring developments in a few banks.

    On March 12, 2023, I approved emergency systemic risk exceptions 
(SREs) with regard to Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank upon the 
unanimous written recommendations of both the Board of Directors of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board). I also approved 
the establishment of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) by the 
Federal Reserve Board and the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund 
(ESF) as a backstop for the BTFP. Pursuant to these actions, all 
depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank have been made 
whole, with no losses borne by the taxpayer. Shareholders and certain 
unsecured debtholders were not, and will not be, protected.

    The SRE determinations and establishment of the BTFP were publicly 
announced at 6:15 p.m. on March 12th. Treasury promptly notified 
congressional leadership at 6:26 p.m. and scheduled a bicameral, 
bipartisan briefing for shortly thereafter. At 7 p.m. that evening, 
Treasury's Under Secretary for Domestic Finance briefed members of 
Congress, including committee members, on the SRE determinations. 
Concurrently with this briefing, the FSOC met at 7:30 p.m. to discuss 
developments in the banking sector and the actions taken by the FDIC, 
the Federal Reserve Board, and Treasury. Treasury further provided 
written congressional notification of the SRE determinations by letter 
on March 13th.

    Question. How many agency staff are currently working from home? 
How many workers do you expect to be back full-time in the office by 
the end of the year?

    Answer. Telework usage accordingly varies across offices and 
bureaus, depending on mission needs and work roles. Employees 
performing national security functions or engaged in the manufacturing 
of currency are required to maintain a significant on-site work 
presence, while other Treasury employees have been able to operate 
effectively on a hybrid schedule.

    For example, approximately 2,480 personnel are assigned to DO, 
almost 60 percent of whom are assigned to Main Treasury (headquarters) 
office space. After DO issued a post-pandemic return-to-work order in 
May 2022, DO employees were required to telework only pursuant to an 
approved telework agreement, as previously required before the 
pandemic. The majority of DO positions allow at least some telework 
flexibility, however, as mentioned, certain functions, such as those 
that provide security or intelligence functions or maintain Treasury 
facilities, require in-person presence. At the direction of OPM, 
Treasury encourages employees in eligible positions to enter telework 
agreements (including situational/episodic agreements) to allow for 
continued operations during emergencies (including weather-related 
events).

    While the majority of DO employees have telework agreements, Main 
Treasury access data shows a large number of DO employees are 
performing their work on-site. Treasury reviewed a recent 8-week 
snapshot (April 23rd through June 17th) of on-site passholders at the 
Main Treasury Complex. Over that period, an average of 956 passholders 
were on-site daily, which represents approximately 67 percent of 
assigned personnel.

    Question. As Secretary of the Department of the Treasury 
(``Treasury''), you serve as chair of the Committee on Foreign 
Investment in the United States (``CFIUS''). In its congressional 
budget justification related to CFIUS, Treasury explained that:

        Treasury is responsible for leading CFIUS in establishing 
        policies, implementing processes and functions, and managing 
        its daily operations. Treasury participates in every aspect of 
        CFIUS, including reviews and investigations, policy and 
        international relations, mitigation monitoring and enforcement, 
        non-notified transaction analysis, legal support, and national 
        security threat assessments.

    Given Treasury's role in CFIUS, please answer the following 
questions to the degree you are able, given the restrictions on the 
CFIUS process.

    According to recent reports, CFIUS has demanded divestiture between 
TikTok and ByteDance. The reports reveal that CFIUS ``told TikTok that 
the government planned to ban the app in the U.S. if its owners didn't 
sell it, according to a TikTok source familiar with the situation.''

    Are these reports accurate?

    If so, why did CFIUS decide to offer this ultimatum now?

    If the reports are accurate, what considerations went into this 
decision?

    Answer. Treasury is committed to keeping Congress informed about 
the activities of the committee and appreciates the interest in the 
acquisition of musical.ly by ByteDance Ltd. At this time, we are not in 
a position to discuss the substance of any engagement with the parties 
for a matter that is the subject of ongoing litigation and under active 
executive branch consideration. We intend to provide a briefing on 
relevant matters to members of Congress at the appropriate time.

    Question. As the Treasury Secretary, you are at the forefront of 
ensuring that our economy is to the best extent possible. As such, if 
the FDIC were to guarantee full insurance on deposits, as they have 
with SVB, how much would Deposit Insurance Fund costs need to be 
raised?

    What would be the total cost to insure all U.S. bank deposits?

    Answer. I would refer you to the FDIC for estimates related to the 
costs of insurance guarantees and associated impact on the Deposit 
Insurance Fund. The FDIC's report on Options for Deposit Insurance 
Reform,\7\ which was released on May 10, 2023, identifies a number of 
considerations put forward for analysis by the FDIC, including Deposit 
Insurance Fund costs, including the agency's analysis of several 
options for reforming the deposit insurance system.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ Available at https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/options-deposit-
insurance-reforms/index.html.

    Question. Are you aware of any conversations following the collapse 
of SVB where regulators told Globally Systemically Important Banks 
(GSIB) not to acquire SVB out of fear it could lead to GSIBs getting 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
larger?

    Answer. I would refer you to the Federal prudential bank 
regulators--the FDIC, Federal Reserve Board, and the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency--regarding their communications with the 
banks they regulate.

    Question. According to The Wall Street Journal, TikTok issued the 
following statement in response to the reported CFIUS ultimatum: 
``Divestment doesn't solve the problem: a change in ownership would not 
impose any new restrictions on data flows or access.'' Given that (1) 
CFIUS is demanding TikTok divest or be banned from the United States 
and that (2) TikTok says divesture would not solve the perceived 
security risk, does this mean TikTok should be banned? Why or why not?

    Answer. In the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 
2018, Congress recognized that certain transactions may expose 
sensitive data of United States citizens to access by a foreign 
government or foreign person that may exploit such information in a 
manner that threatens national security. Furthermore, on September 15, 
2022, the President issued Executive Order 14083 (Ensuring Robust 
Consideration of Evolving National Security Risks by the Committee on 
Foreign Investment in the United States), which underscores the risk 
presented by foreign adversaries' access to data of United States 
persons: ``Data is an increasingly powerful tool for the surveillance, 
tracing, tracking, and targeting of individuals or groups of 
individuals, with potential adverse impacts on national security.'' As 
chair of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, 
Treasury takes this risk to national security very seriously.

    Treasury is committed to keeping Congress informed about the 
activities of the committee and appreciates the interest in the 
acquisition of musical.ly by ByteDance Ltd. At this time, we are not in 
a position to discuss the substance of any engagement with the parties 
for a matter that is the subject of ongoing litigation and under active 
executive branch consideration. We intend to provide a briefing on 
relevant matters to members of Congress at the appropriate time.

    Question. In your own opinion, how can Congress improve the CFIUS 
process?

    Answer. The Department of the Treasury is grateful for the 
bipartisan support from Congress in passing the Foreign Investment Risk 
Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) that strengthened and 
modernized CFIUS. Consistent with the authority provided under FIRRMA, 
CFIUS is reviewing more types of transactions and in some cases 
requiring parties to submit transactions to CFIUS for review. CFIUS may 
review any transaction that could result in foreign control of a U.S. 
business; certain non-controlling, non-passive transactions by foreign 
persons in certain U.S. businesses involved in critical technology, 
critical infrastructure, and sensitive personal data; and transactions 
by foreign persons involving real estate in proximity to sensitive 
government facilities.

    Utilizing the authorities and resources that Congress provided, 
CFIUS is appropriately equipped with the processes necessary to fully 
consider the risks to national security presented by certain foreign 
investments in the United States. When a transaction is identified and 
falls within CFIUS's statutory jurisdiction, CFIUS thoroughly considers 
the national security effects of each such transaction and takes 
appropriate action, including through legally binding and enforceable 
mitigation measures or a recommendation to the President for his 
decision regarding a transaction.

    Question. Pillar 2's enforcement is via the ``Under-Taxed Profits 
Rule'' (UTPR). There has been skepticism from the tax and legal 
communities suggesting that the UTPR is inconsistent with our existing 
tax treaty obligations as well as historic international norms.

    How did the U.S. Treasury conclude that this extraterritorial tax 
regime is consistent with the existing treaty obligations previously 
negotiated by the United States?

    Why did Treasury choose not to pursue a multilateral instrument to 
resolve these questions?

    If U.S.-based MNE claimed treaty protection related to UTPRs 
asserted by our treaty partners, would the U.S. Treasury support the 
U.S.-based taxpayers in these claims?

    How will disputes between countries and businesses be resolved?

    What protections are in place to ensure that U.S. MNEs are fairly 
treated during these disputes?

    Answer. When developing legislative proposals that would affect the 
international provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the Treasury 
Department takes care to closely evaluate the question of the 
compatibility of the proposals with the obligations of the United 
States under its bilateral income tax treaties. The Treasury Department 
has taken the same approach with the development of Pillar 2 and 
believes that the Pillar 2 rules are compatible with U.S. tax treaties. 
As a general matter, the enactment of Pillar 2 in the United States 
would require the passage of legislation by the Congress without the 
need for a multilateral instrument. Nevertheless, the Treasury 
Department is participating in ongoing discussions at the OECD about 
the possibility of a multilateral instrument that would facilitate the 
resolution of disputes between countries regarding the application of 
the Pillar 2 taxes.

               Questions Submitted by Hon. Sherrod Brown
    Question. One of the key objectives of the Inflation Reduction Act 
was to establish a robust manufacturing supply chain--in the United 
States--for clean energy technologies. In the past, our tax laws have 
allowed critical components for those technologies to be sourced 
outside the United States and provided a tax subsidy for those items--
including in cases where foreign governments already substantially 
subsidize component manufacturing to the detriment of U.S. 
manufacturers. This is particularly true of solar modules and solar 
module components--which are predominantly made in China and subsidized 
by the Chinese Government. Congress enacted the section 45X advanced 
manufacturing tax credit and domestic content bonus credit to redress 
these inequities to U.S. manufacturers and incentivize a U.S.-based 
supply chain for clean energy equipment including solar modules.

    As Treasury prepares regulations with respect to section 45X, will 
the regulations prevent companies subsidized by China or other foreign 
governments from profiting from these tax incentives without 
establishing a true U.S. supply chain? If not, why not?

    Answer. Building a clean energy economy here in the United States, 
and reducing our reliance on China, are core goals of the Inflation 
Reduction Act and the administration. The IRA contains powerful 
incentives for manufacturing in the United States, and we are seeing 
its effects across the country through major new investments in solar, 
batteries, and other clean energy technologies. We are working on 
guidance on the section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit, I assure 
you that our national security and energy security are paramount 
considerations.

    Question. Section 45X provides credits for each step in the supply 
chain with respect to eligible components and provides that a taxpayer 
will be treated as having sold an eligible component to an unrelated 
person if such component is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into 
another eligible component which is sold to an unrelated person--for 
example, a solar manufacturer that manufacturers wafers and cells that 
are integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a solar module.

    Will the guidance issued by Treasury confirm that a manufacturer 
that performs several steps of the supply chain will be entitled to the 
full amount of credits for each of the individual eligible components 
it produces--for example, credits for the wafers, the cells, and the 
modules?

    Answer. We are working expeditiously on guidance on the section 45X 
credit, taking into careful consideration the hundreds of comments we 
have received and other public input. We understand the need to provide 
clarity and certainty for taxpayers to realize section 45X's powerful 
incentives for domestic manufacturing, consistent with congressional 
intent and sound tax administration.

                                 ______
                                 
             Questions Submitted by Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin
    Question. As you know, our tax code significantly changed as a 
result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. One of the many negative 
consequences of this legislation is a provision that changed the way 
companies treat research and development costs. Instead of allowing 
companies to expense research and development costs in the same year 
the costs were incurred. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act requires that 
R&D costs be capitalized and amortized over 5 years for domestic costs.

    The TCJA change in treatment of R&D costs will cause many small 
businesses to incur a larger tax burden on their R&D investments in the 
short term. As a result of these changes coming into effect recently, I 
have heard from numerous small businesses that participate in the Small 
Business Administration's Small Business Innovation and Research 
program and the Small Business Technology Transfer Program expressing 
how detrimental the 2017 TCJA change is to their small business's 
ability to continue to operate and innovate. Unlike large companies, 
these small companies do not have the flexibility and are more 
susceptible to short-term cash disruptions than large companies.

    How can we mitigate the impact of this change on small businesses 
participating in the SBIR program to ensure their continued innovation 
and retain their important contributions to national security?

    Answer. The TCJA requires domestic R&D expenses incurred after 
December 31, 2021 to be amortized over 5 years instead of being 
immediately deductible. On September 8, 2023, Treasury and the IRS 
issued Notice 2023-63, which provided interim guidance to address this 
change in law so that businesses may file their tax returns with 
certainty. Treasury and the IRS intend to issue additional guidance 
under section 174 to address this change in law to provide additional 
certainty to businesses.

    Question. As I have stated before at different hearings and in 
letters to the Department of the Treasury, entities cannot seek, 
accept, or solicit payments from designers in exchange for providing 
section 179D allocation letters. The Treasury Department has already 
confirmed the Finance committee's intent.

    The issuance of a section 179D allocation letter shall not be used 
as leverage to request a payment from a designer; allocation letters 
should be duly issued once the applicable design services have been 
performed.

    The Senate Finance Committee appreciates the comments regarding 
this issue that Senator Crapo and I received in the 116th Congress on 
our Tax Task Forces, making clear that industry is concerned by the 
behavior of some State and local government entities, asking for return 
cash benefits in order for them to issue the allocation letter. I also 
appreciate your response last Congress, highlighting that a project was 
included to address this issue on the IRS priority guidance list.

    These actions run counter to the intent of section 179D(d)(4)'s 
express direction to allow the allocation of the section 179D deduction 
``. . . to the person primarily responsible for designing the property 
in lieu of the owner of such property.''

    Consistent with congressional intent, the section 179D allocation 
letters are administrative in nature and serve to formalize the 
allocation of the tax deduction to the eligible designer.

    It's an issue that doesn't seem to go away.

    Will you commit to working with us to complete the project listed 
to address this issue on the IRS priority guidance list this year? Can 
you provide an update on this project?

    Answer. Treasury and IRS are actively working on guidance on the 
Inflation Reduction Act's energy efficiency incentives, including 
guidance under the section 179D Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings 
Deduction to clarify the definition of designer and other issues. In 
October, we released Notice 2022-48, requesting public input on the 
IRA's energy efficiency incentives for residential and commercial 
buildings, including the section 179D deduction. In December, we 
published Announcement 2023-1, updating the applicable reference 
standard used for determining the section 179D deduction. We are 
pleased to stay in touch with you and your staff as further guidance is 
issued.

    Question. In 2012 in my home State of Maryland, the Bank of Eastern 
Shore was closed by the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation 
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was named receiver in 
order to protect depositors and the public. The problem then was a lack 
of capital, which is quite different than the situation that we find 
ourselves in with Silicon Valley Bank, but the outcome is the same. A 
lack of faith from depositors and the need to deal with both insured 
and uninsured deposits.

    In 2012, the FDIC stated that Eastern Shore depositors will receive 
full payment only for insured deposits up to $250,000 aside from 
certain entitlements and types of accounts that may be insured above 
this limit. Today, the administration is ensuring that all deposits in 
Silicon Valley Bank even those above $250,000 will be insured.

    I appreciate the administration protecting taxpayers, instilling 
confidence in our banking system with these actions, and placing any 
cost associated with these actions on the banking community. The 
actions taken ensure confidence for the depositors and allow these 
companies to make payroll to their workers.

    However, I would like to know the administration's view on what 
these actions mean for the future. Has Treasury considered how these 
actions will set a precedence for insuring deposits over $250,000 in 
future bank failures, including ones similar to the 2012 Maryland bank 
failures?

    Answer. On March 12, 2023, the Secretary of the Treasury approved 
emergency systemic risk exceptions (SREs) with regard to Silicon Valley 
Bank and Signature Bank upon the unanimous written recommendations of 
both the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System (Federal Reserve Board).\8\ The Secretary also approved the 
establishment of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) by the Federal 
Reserve Board and the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) as a 
backstop for the BTFP. Pursuant to these actions, all depositors of 
Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank have been made whole, with no 
losses borne by the taxpayer. Shareholders and certain unsecured 
debtholders were not, and will not be, protected.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ Under section 13(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the 
FDIC generally must comply with the least-cost requirement when 
resolving a failed bank. Under the SRE authority in section 13(c)(4)(G) 
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC is not required to 
comply with the least-cost requirement if, upon the written 
recommendation of the FDIC board and the Federal Reserve board (upon a 
vote of not less than two-thirds of the members of each board), the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the President, 
determines that (1) the FDIC's compliance with the least-cost 
requirement with respect to an insured depository institution for which 
the FDIC has been appointed receiver would have serious adverse effects 
on economic conditions or financial stability; and (2) any action or 
assistance under the SRE would avoid or mitigate such adverse effects. 
After an SRE determination has been made, the FDIC ``may take other 
action or provide assistance under [section 13 of the FDIA] for the 
purpose of winding up the insured depository institution for which the 
[FDIC] has been appointed receiver as necessary to avoid or mitigate 
such effects.'' 12 U.S.C. 1823(c)(4)(G)(i).

    The decisive actions that the Federal Government took in March 2023 
to protect depositors and provide additional liquidity to the system 
mitigated the very serious risk of broader financial contagion in the 
banking system. These steps were not taken to aid specific institutions 
or classes of institutions. Rather, these actions were necessary to 
prevent the difficulties facing two specific banks from spilling over 
to other banks--including community banks across the country. We 
continue to closely monitor conditions and are prepared to take further 
actions if needed, including if smaller institutions suffer deposit 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
runs that pose the risk of contagion.

    Since our actions in March, the FDIC has issued a public report on 
Options for Deposit Insurance Reform,\9\ which identifies a number of 
considerations with respect to options for reforming the deposit 
insurance system. Treasury is reviewing the FDIC's report, and 
consistent with our shared commitment to support the resilience of the 
broader financial system, we look forward to further collaboration with 
the FDIC, Federal Reserve, and other agencies and stakeholders to 
evaluate recent events and consider potential policy responses.

    The economic progress that we have made over the past 2 years has 
been premised on the fact that communities are able to access the 
credit they need. Community banks have been at the forefront of this 
effort, as they have been for decades. The Treasury Department will 
continue to promote actions and policies that are supportive of a 
strong banking system and advance the economic well-being of the

              Questions Submitted by Hon. Thomas R. Carper
    Question. One impactful way that the IRS can make life easier for 
everyday Americans is by expanding access to simplified and low-cost 
tax filing options.

    How will recent investments in the IRS help facilitate more direct 
tax filing options?

    Answer. It can take an average of 13 hours to file an individual 
income tax return and hundreds of dollars. We can and must do better. 
It is critical that IRS work on strategies and devote resources to make 
tax filing easier, simpler, and less burdensome for taxpayers. As 
required by the IRA, the IRS has established a Task Force to study the 
option of taxpayers filing their taxes directly with the IRS. The 
report examined the feasibility of the IRS providing a direct file 
service and the associated costs. It also included survey results to 
understand taxpayer opinion, expectations of and level of trust in an 
IRS direct file service, as well as user research into taxpayer 
interest in an IRS filing option and challenges to launching the 
program. Given the results of the study, Treasury directed the IRS to 
develop a limited scope pilot that would provide a Direct File option 
for some taxpayers for filing season 2024.

    Question. In 2021, Congress passed the Corporate Transparency Act, 
which is aimed at cracking down on money laundering and terrorist 
financing by requiring entities to report beneficial ownership 
information to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). 
FinCEN recently promulgated regulations to implement these reporting 
requirements, which go into effect on January 1, 2024.

    While I support FinCEN's efforts to establish a new beneficial 
ownership reporting regime, I am concerned States will serve as the 
``first line of defense'' as individuals navigate this new process, 
fielding a significant number of questions, requests, and concerns. I 
believe it will be critical for FinCEN to closely coordinate with the 
States and provide resources to address concerns, field questions, and 
eliminate confusion when the regulations go into effect in January.

    How does FinCEN intend to partner with the States to ensure they 
have the resources they need to assist with implementation?

    Answer. Ensuring that all parties understand the new beneficial 
ownership rules is a top priority for FinCEN, and we are conducting 
broad outreach to a variety of stakeholder groups. With respect to 
States, we have had a number of discussions with Secretaries of State 
through the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), 
including meetings with the NASS Business Services Committee and NASS 
corporate affiliates, and other stakeholders during the Annual 
Executive Strategic Planning Conference for registered agents, to share 
information on the new Reporting Rule and related guidance documents 
and to hear their questions and concerns. FinCEN has similarly engaged 
with the International Association of Commercial Administrators (IACA), 
a professional association for government administrators of business 
organization and secured transaction registries at the State, 
provincial, territorial, and national level.

    FinCEN intends to continue these engagements as implementation 
progresses to clarify reporting requirements and educate the public. 
FinCEN is also planning to conduct outreach to a variety of other State 
and local government stakeholders that regularly interact with the 
public, including, for example Governors, Mayors, and State financial 
institution supervisors.

    Question. Will FinCEN commit to providing the States with materials 
to help educate staff and direct individuals and small business owners 
to the appropriate resources?

    Answer. Yes. FinCEN is working to issue guidance materials and 
establish a help line that will assist small business owners in filing 
beneficial ownership information (BOI) reports and minimize burden. 
Prior to the effective date of the Reporting Rule, FinCEN will publish 
guidance documents and materials, including a Small Entity Compliance 
Guide, in an effort to lessen the burden on small businesses and States 
by explaining in clear, plain language what small businesses need to 
report. FinCEN published the first of these guidance materials on March 
24, 2023, which included (1) an initial set of frequently asked 
questions; (2) two infographics outlining the six key questions on BOI 
reporting and key filing dates; and (3) a video introduction to raise 
awareness of the BOI reporting requirement. We plan to provide further 
guidance materials in the form of additional frequently asked 
questions, infographics, and videos throughout implementation of the 
CTA, and to make key information available in multiple languages where 
possible. We also intend to conduct webinars and issue technical job 
aids to support reporting companies with filing their BOI reports. 
FinCEN is committed to assisting reporting companies through various 
mediums, including a contact center. The contact center will provide 
multiple channels of communication to support reporting companies 
through the beneficial ownership reporting process.

    FinCEN's robust engagement strategy also includes public outreach 
through a number of other channels (including discussions with State 
agencies, professional organizations including, among others, the 
American Bar Association and American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants, and small business organizations) as a complement to the 
issuance of comprehensive guidance.

    Question. Will FinCEN commit to regular briefings with the States 
both before and after the regulations go into effect on January 1, 
2024?

    Answer. FinCEN will continue to have broad-based and active 
outreach to stakeholder groups, including relevant State agencies and 
associations. In addition, we would welcome any proactive outreach and 
ideas from our State partners to ensure the smoothest possible launch.

    Question. What funding is needed from Congress to ensure States are 
properly equipped with the resources needed?

    Answer. We appreciate the resources Congress has provided to FinCEN 
and are working intensively to ensure that States have comprehensive 
information to provide to their constituents on the beneficial 
ownership reporting requirements. We would defer to the States on their 
specific needs but look forward to continuing to work in a 
collaborative manner with Congress to address any additional resource 
needs.

    Question. Over the years, Taiwan and the United States have forged 
close ties, with Taiwan as one of our top trading partners. Our 
relationship with Taiwan has never been stronger, yet our international 
tax policy fails to reflect the strength and importance of this 
relationship. With no formal income tax treaty between our two 
countries, Taiwanese and U.S. businesses are double-taxed, placing an 
undue burden on these businesses and hindering further investment 
opportunities.

    In your view, how would an income tax agreement with Taiwan 
encourage economic growth and investments in both Taiwan and the United 
States and further deepen our ties with a trusted partner?

    Answer. Taiwan is a vital trading partner with the United States. 
Cross-border investments between Taiwan and the United States are 
substantial in size. The administration is actively considering 
alternative approaches that could reduce tax-
related barriers to cross-border investments between Taiwan and the 
United States.

            Questions Submitted by Hon. Robert P. Casey, Jr.
    Question. The White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and 
Empowerment is a cross-agency body, headed by Vice President Harris, 
which has drawn valuable attention to the issues of workers' rights and 
the ways that the Federal Government can and should be working in a 
whole-of-government approach. In February 2022, the task force 
submitted over 70 recommendations to President Biden, which he 
approved. I fully support the work of this task force and look forward 
to seeing all its recommendations implemented. Implementing these 
recommendations so far has helped increase the number of Federal 
employees in a union by 20 percent, and has led to the development of 
economy-wide standards which will raise wages, working standards, and 
promote worker empowerment.

    Now a year after the President approved these recommendations, the 
task force has released an ``Update on Implementation of Approved 
Actions.'' Of the four recommendations submitted to the Department of 
the Treasury, one appears to be completed, one partially completed, one 
remains in progress, and the status of the fourth is unclear. The 
latter recommendation was for the Treasury to ``identify and evaluate 
additional proposals to be included in next year's Green Book,'' such 
as ``proposals to make union dues eligible for a tax credit or an 
above-the-line deduction'' or ``to deny deductions for expenses paid or 
incurred by employers or other taxpayers to further activities that 
impede or inhibit workers' efforts to organize.'' No proposals similar 
to these recommendations are included in this year's Green Book.

    While I applaud Green Book recommendations to improve the Earned 
Income Tax Credit and the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, it is important 
that our tax code do more to support workers and worker organizing, 
especially in light of the expressed goals of this administration.

    Can you provide an update on the Treasury Department's progress in 
implementing the Presidential recommendations from the Task Force on 
Worker Organizing and Empowerment?

    Answer. The Treasury Department strongly supports the Worker 
Empowerment Task Force. The Office of Tax Policy continues to review 
proposals related to the Task Force's mission. In August, Treasury and 
the IRS issued proposed regulations detailing the prevailing wage and 
apprenticeship requirements of the Inflation Reduction Act.\10\

certain-prevailing-wage-and-registered.

    Question. Related to the previous question, how do you believe our 
tax code could better support worker rights, including ``the right to a 
free and fair choice to join a union'', which is the ``guiding 
principle of the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and 
Empowerment''? Can we expect proposals to this effect in the next Green 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Book?

    Answer. The development of the revenue proposals for the next Green 
Book are ongoing. Treasury appreciates your leadership on this issue 
and will take this comment into consideration as we work to develop the 
next Green Book.

    Question. Over the next 10 years, the Inflation Reduction Act is 
going to put America back at the forefront of clean energy technology 
and manufacturing. This once-in-a-generation investment in our climate 
future will create millions of well-paying jobs in manufacturing, 
boosting our domestic production of wind, solar, and clean vehicles. 
Across the Nation and around the Commonwealth, the IRA will help 
stimulate communities where manufacturing once thrived and support new 
jobs for electricians, technicians, mechanics, construction workers, 
steel and iron workers, and many others. This magnitude of job creation 
is only made possible by the domestic content credit enhancements that 
Congress included in this legislation. These credit enhancements will 
ensure that the full value of these investments are realized by an 
American supply chain with American workers. Companies are already 
beginning to plan and implement their investments in clean energy 
technology, deployment, and manufacturing but require certainty around 
domestic content requirements.

    What barriers stand in the way of Treasury issuing guidance on 
domestic content credit enhancements? And how can industry, Congress, 
and Treasury better work together to ensure swift rollout of guidance 
that builds the U.S. manufacturing base over the long term?

    Answer. Treasury and the administration share your enthusiasm and 
support for the IRA's job incentives. The domestic content credit 
enhancements have been a top implementation priority. On May 12, 2023, 
the Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service released 
initial guidance that describes rules Treasury and the IRS intend to 
propose relating to the domestic content bonus under the Inflation 
Reduction Act for clean energy projects and facilities that meet 
American manufacturing and sourcing requirements.

    Question. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires 
Federal departments and agencies to ensure that information and 
communication technology is accessible for people with disabilities. 
Over the last year, I have used my position as chairman of the Aging 
Committee to examine compliance with this law, and assess the 
accessibility of Federal technology, including Federal websites, for 
people with disabilities, older adults and veterans. In December 2022, 
I released Unlocking the Virtual Front Door, an investigation that 
found troubling examples of inaccessible technology across the Federal 
Government, and which issued 12 recommendations to improve 
accessibility. In February 2023, the Department of Justice (DOJ) 
responded to my calls for greater transparency of section 508 
compliance, releasing data that confirmed the findings of my report.

    I am concerned that people with disabilities are being locked out 
of government services and are not given a level playing field in 
Federal workplaces due to inaccessible technology at the Department of 
Treasury (Treasury). According to data Treasury submitted to DOJ, 82 
percent of Treasury's 28,969 Internet webpages are compliant with 
section 508 accessibility requirements, while 74 percent of the 3,839 
intranet webpages are compliant. Moreover, 25 years after section 508 
was signed into law, Treasury reported that each of its program areas--
acquisition, electronic information technology lifecycle activities, 
testing and validation, compliance process, and training--are not at 
the General Service Administration's (GSA) highest program maturity 
level. Given these concerns, please answer the following questions.

    How does Treasury plan to improve section 508 compliance for its 
external websites, internal websites, and other electronic and 
information technology?

    Answer. Treasury prioritizes updates to our information technology 
resources, balancing mission priorities with technical, operational and 
security requirements. As part of our normal IT investment governance 
practices, accessibility and 508 compliance are among the significant 
factors considered when prioritizing our IT investment portfolio. In 
addition to our ongoing governance reviews and prioritization efforts, 
Treasury procured a website accessibility tool (Monsido) to better 
manage 508 compliance for its public web presence. We are also 
leveraging the Social Security Administration's Open Source tool called 
ANDI to assist with identifying opportunities for improving the 
accessibility of our myTreasury intranet portal. We are presently 
pursuing budget proposals to further expand utilization of Monsido and 
considering comparable investments for our internal content management 
(intranet, collaboration sites, etc.)

    What follows are some examples of recent enhancements to our public 
facing websites.

    In 2021 and 2022, and on into 2023, Public Affairs staff partnered 
with the Office of the CIO (OCIO) in advocating for and promoting 
accessibility. OCIO's Digital team developed the following materials to 
assist policy offices in creating accessible documents: accessible 
document templates; accessible tables and images templates; full-length 
authoring documents guide; accessible document cheat-sheet/checklist; 
and training sessions as needed with policy office staff.

    OCIO's Digital team incorporates section 508 compliance from the 
beginning of the public site development process and iteratively 
revisits 508 compliance throughout the migration of existing, and the 
creation of new, public facing websites. From 2020 through 2023, 
Digital developed several new, 508 compliant, high-profile public 
facing applications in support of multiple assistance programs 
established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security 
(CARES) Act, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental 
Appropriations Act of 2021, and the American Rescue Plan. In 2022 
Digital also, in cooperation with the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, 
redesigned and migrated the BEP.gov website, and in cooperation with 
the Bureau of Fiscal Service, migrated the Treasury Financial Manual 
Website. In 2023, Digital, in cooperation with the Treasury Office of 
Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, created a new .org website for a 
multinational anti-terrorism task force. Digital incorporated 508 
compliance into the redesign/design process for all of these 
aforementioned sites.

    Finally, Treasury is continually pursuing efforts to consolidate 
management of its forward-facing web presence to optimize delivery, 
provide common experience and better leverage tools/products for 
content delivery, digital design, and 508 compliance. In the last 24 
months, Treasury Departmental Offices OCIO has assumed management 
responsibility for BEP.gov, SIGPR.gov, and multiple Fiscal Service 
sites (Home | TFX: Treasury Financial Experience https://
tfx.treasury.gov/ and TFM Home | Treasury TFM https://
tfm.fiscal.treasury.gov/) and is evaluating TTB.gov and USMint.gov for 
further consolidation. Treasury is intentionally centralizing the 
content delivery, content management and cloud hosting to reduce costs, 
secure environments and promote improved accessibility.

    Question. When does Treasury expect to meet GSA's highest program 
maturity level for each of the five program levels?

    Answer. While ensuring the accessibility of Treasury's services is 
of significant importance to Treasury, we must balance those 
requirements with ensuring those services are delivered securely and 
reliably. To that end, we do not have defined dates for achieving the 
highest program maturity level in each of the program areas, but 
instead ensure that it is one of the significant priorities evaluated 
as new investments arise. It should also be noted that some of 
Treasury's services are built on vendor supplied solutions. In those 
cases, we are very much dependent on the timeframes within which those 
vendors improve the 508 compliance of their platforms.

    Question. Treasury reported evaluating 28,969 Internet webpages and 
3,839 intranet webpages, respectively. What percentage of Treasury's 
total internet and intranet webpages were evaluated?

    Answer. In compliance with GSA's section 508 compliance website 
(www.
Section508.gov), Treasury does not track total pages as part of our 
conformance metrics, but instead samples content across key Inter/
intranet sites.

    Question. Please describe the existing pathways for employees and 
the public to file section 508 complaints with Treasury at a 
departmental level, as well as the Internal Revenue Service? Please 
provide the number of section 508 complaints Treasury has received for 
each of the last 5 fiscal years?

    Answer. Treasury's public website (www.treasury.gov) allows the 
public to file section 508 complaints via its ``Accessibility'' link on 
the site's top banner which initiates an email to 
accesstreas@treasury.gov. Likewise, the IRS offers guidance here 
Protecting Taxpayer Civil Rights|Internal Revenue Service (https://
www.irs.gov/about-irs/protecting-taxpayer-civil-rights) and provides 
the public a 508 Accessibility user guide for irs.gov as well as its 
public-facing IRS applications. This approach is commonly deployed 
across the Treasury public facing portfolio with redirects to the 
Treasury.gov site where appropriate and supporting text for filing 
complaints. Accessibility hyperlinks are typically available at either 
the header or footer of the primary landing page with subpages offering 
supplemental detail regarding complaint filing instructions and 
relevant parties.

    For internal Departmental Offices employees and contractors, there 
is no formal guidance posted on the intranet for 508 compliance 
complaints. Individual requests are addressed upon receipt with 
technical remediations applied when possible. Reasonable accommodations 
are considered as appropriate through the formal RA program. Within 
IRS, the IRM on section 508 details the complaint process in section 
2.30.1.11 2.30.1 section 508 Compliance|Internal Revenue Service 
(https://www.irs.gov/irm/part2/irm_02-030-001#idm139645857543856).

    Departmental Offices does not track the annual quantity of 508 
compliance complaints submitted however the occurrences are infrequent 
and typically are single digit in sum. Note that all IRS and Treasury 
508 complaints are included with the total Treasury EDI complaints in 
the FY 2021 Management Directive 715 report. FY 2021 Management 
Directive 715 (MD-715) Report (https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/
306/FY-2021-MD-715-Report.pdf).

                Questions Submitted by Hon. Bill Cassidy
    Question. The administration's stated goal when placing a cap on 
the price of Russian crude oil was to avoid market disruption. While I 
support the use of a price cap, I have concerns about cap 
implementation and the administration's goals in helping Ukraine win in 
the fight against Russia. I believe the administration could take 
additional steps towards helping Ukraine succeed.

    There have been various reports regarding the significance of the 
impact of the G7 price cap on Russia's economy, given that China and 
India have become Russia's two major export markets.

    Which specific economic impacts to Russia's economy have the 
administration and G7 seen since the price cap was implemented?

    Answer. The price cap policy has dual goals: reducing Russian 
revenues and stabilizing global energy markets. There is consistent 
evidence from data, statements, and policy changes coming out of Russia 
that the price cap and other sanctions policies have dented the 
Kremlin's revenues. According to the Russian Ministry of Finance, 
Federal Government oil revenues from January through March of 2023 were 
45 percent lower than a year prior. Further, Russian Deputy Prime 
Minister Alexander Novak and the Russian Central Bank have also openly 
acknowledged that the price cap policy is hindering Russia's ability to 
fund its war. Lastly, Russian oil now trades at a significant discount 
to other global oil--a discount which expanded significantly when the 
price cap was implemented. As the price for Russian oil has plummeted, 
the Kremlin has repeatedly reengineered Russia's tax code to squeeze 
more revenue out of a shrinking tax base.

    Question. Is the G7 considering lowering the price cap from $65 to 
a number that may be closer to Russia's per-barrel marginal cost of 
production, which we are told may be in the range of $35?

    Answer. The crude oil price cap of $60 per barrel has made 
significant progress toward our dual goals. The price cap on Russian 
crude oil has helped stabilize global energy supplies while 
simultaneously reducing Russia's revenues. According to the Russian 
Ministry of Finance, Federal Government oil revenues from January 
through March of 2023 were 45 percent lower than a year prior. Russian 
export levels have been steady and Russian oil has traded at a 
meaningful discount.

    The price cap policy is only beginning to fully come into effect in 
recent months. While we are encouraged at the initial trade data we are 
observing, we are mindful that energy prices and supply can fluctuate 
due to the many shocks permeating global markets. We will continue to 
monitor global energy market conditions before making any changes to 
the price cap policy.

                                 ______
                                 
                 Question Submitted by Hon. John Cornyn
    Question. I wish to follow up on an issue that I have previously 
raised with you. Revenue Procedure 2005-62 allows utilities to finance 
certain costs that can be recovered from ratepayers over time through a 
special purpose financing entity owned by a utility but not by a State.

    When a major storm or natural disaster hits, whether it is a 
hurricane, wildfire, or devastating winter storm, utilities are 
required to take prompt action to remediate damage as quickly as 
possible. Typically, utilities will recover the costs of the repairs 
from ratepayers over time through regulator-approved surcharges. Recent 
laws enacted in Texas and other States allow these storm remediation 
costs to be securitized through an instrumentality owned by the State. 
This will mean lower borrowing costs and a lower utility bill for 
individuals and small businesses across Texas.

    For over 15 years, guidance from the IRS has facilitated the 
ability of utilities to finance these costs over time through a special 
purpose financing entity owned by the utility. However, such guidance 
would not apply to a special purpose vehicle owned by the State of 
Texas.

    Will you commit that you and your team will examine broadening 
Revenue Procedure 2005-62 guidance to cover State owned special purpose 
vehicles and follow up with my office within 60 days with an analysis?

    Answer. Staff from the Office of Tax Policy and the IRS Office of 
Chief Counsel have been studying the issue of how to update Revenue 
Procedure 2005-62 for recent laws enacted in Texas and other States. 
The Office of Tax Policy would welcome a conversation with your office 
to discuss this issue.

           Questions Submitted by Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto
    Question. A group of House Republicans recently released a list of 
demands that would be required for them to vote to avoid a catastrophic 
default on our debt. Among other things, it called for Congress to 
immediately pass legislation to return non-defense discretionary 
funding to fiscal year 2019 levels. That would mean an immediate 
drastic reduction in funding for your Department, but it would also 
include things like veteran's benefits, border security, Pell Grants, 
infrastructure, and more.

    How would a plan to immediately return to FY 2019 non-defense 
discretionary levels impact both your Department and the broader 
economy?

    Answer. Spending reductions like these would undermine critical 
services provided by the Treasury Department that the American people 
rely on in their everyday lives. Treasury and its bureaus conduct 
essential financial functions such as payments, providing tax refunds, 
and taxpayer assistance. Any proposal to return appropriations to lower 
funding levels--such as FY 2019--would be devastating to American 
families, small businesses, and taxpayers.

    Treasury is also responsible for revenue collection, financial 
management, borrowing, and debt collection for the entire government. 
It promotes international economic stability, protects the integrity of 
the financial system, and combats global financial crime and 
corruption. In March, for example, the government took decisive and 
forceful actions to strengthen public confidence in our banking system. 
Reductions to Treasury funding would significantly impair our ability 
to monitor such risks and ensure an effective and unified approach to 
promoting financial stability and growth. Reduced investments in 
initiatives by Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial 
Intelligence (TFI) would jeopardize our national security by impacting 
Treasury's ability to craft, implement, and enforce sanctions, 
including the historic sanctions program targeting Russia's illegal war 
in Ukraine. Reductions at FinCEN would reduce the Department's ability 
to enforce anti-money laundering and corporate transparency laws, and 
disrupt development and implementation of the beneficial ownership 
database system. Further, any cuts to Treasury's programs would also 
mean significantly fewer resources for Community Development Financial 
Institutions (CDFI) grants and assistance, thus harming the economic 
vitality of America's most economically disadvantaged communities by 
reducing small business lending, affordable housing, and the provision 
of consumer products and services.

    Additionally, across-the-board reductions to all programs would 
force the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to divert funding provided in 
the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to cover steady-state operations, 
significantly undermining the improvements taxpayers have seen, 
including an exponential increase in service. In this scenario, IRS 
would not have the resources it needs to achieve the congressional 
objective of modernizing its technology, dramatically improving 
customer service, and building up enforcement capacity to pursue high-
end tax evaders.

    Question. Post-pandemic, a higher number of workers report that 
lack of child care is causing them not to join the workforce. Many of 
our peer nations have more generous child benefits than the U.S. and 
also have higher labor force participation rates. Do you agree that 
providing more generous child benefits, such as the enhanced Child Tax 
Credit, can help boost labor force participation in the U.S.?

    Answer. A number of academic researchers and third-party studies 
have found that the expanded Child Tax Credit and introduction of 
monthly payments reduced financial instability and poverty but did not 
discourage work. Data featuring the voices of families themselves has 
even found that some families saw parents identify the payments as a 
source of support to enable work. For example, the Child Tax Credit 
could be used to balance paid work and caregiving by covering child-
care costs or helping hard-pressed families cover the costs of 
transportation to and from work.

    Question. Breaching, or even coming close to breaching, the debt 
limit later this year could raise borrowing costs for the Federal 
Government by causing interest rates to rise.

    Does the Department of Treasury believe such a scenario would 
increase our Nation's Federal debt and if so, does it have any 
estimates of how much long term borrowing costs could increase?

    Answer. The Treasury Department is pleased that Congress passed 
bipartisan legislation to suspend the debt limit and prevent a first-
ever default by the United States. This legislation protects the full 
faith and credit of the United States and preserves our financial 
leadership, which is critical to our economic growth and stability. Had 
Congress not acted to suspend the debt limit, a default would have 
caused severe hardship for American families, potentially leading to 
the loss of millions of jobs and trillions in household wealth, and 
higher financing costs for American taxpayers for years to come. 
Congress has a duty to ensure that the United States can pay its bills 
on time, and the full faith and credit of the United States must never 
be used as a bargaining chip.

                                 ______
                                 
                Questions Submitted by Hon. Steve Daines
    Question. Under Pillar 2, foreign companies are able to exclude 
some income from taxation based on the number of workers they employ in 
their country. Such an exclusion does not currently exist under the 
GILTI regime in the U.S. tax code. The administration has proposed a 
number of changes to GILTI in its budget, but it did not include this 
exclusion for employing American workers among them.

    Do you believe the absence of parity on such an exclusion creates 
an incentive for companies to ship jobs overseas?

    Answer. U.S. companies are currently subject to a minimum tax 
regime that their foreign competitors are not, and despite that 
difference, the United States remains a desirable jurisdiction in which 
to operate, and U.S. businesses thrive. We have confidence that under 
the proposals in the administration's Green Book, when combined with 
the worldwide adoption of the OECD framework, U.S. businesses will be 
better off than they are currently.

    Question. Understanding that we differ on the merits of the 
spending proposed in the President's budget, do you believe the 
President's $4.7 trillion in proposed tax hikes will have a positive 
impact on growth in the next 5 years?

    Answer. The President's proposed budget builds on our economic 
progress by making smart, fiscally responsible investments. These 
investments would be more than fully paid for by requiring corporations 
and the wealthiest to pay their fair share. Fiscal discipline remains a 
central priority in the budget. The budget proposes a minimum income 
tax of 25 percent on taxpayers with wealth in excess of $100 million. 
It also proposes an increase of the corporate tax rate to 28 percent 
from the current 21 percent. And it will come as no surprise that I 
hope Congress will implement the United States' part of the global 
minimum tax deal.

    On the spending side, the budget proposes additional investments to 
boost our long-term growth potential. This includes improving the 
availability of high-quality child care, providing free and universal 
preschool, and boosting the supply of affordable housing. We also 
propose restoring the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit 
expansions that were enacted in 2021 but have since expired.

               Questions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley
    Question. During your nomination hearing, I asked you to commit to 
provide a prompt response in writing to any questions addressed to you 
by any Senator of the committee, and you agreed to that.

    On Friday, February 10, 2023, you finally responded to written 
questions sent to you after a June 7, 2022, hearing on the President's 
Fiscal Year 2023 budget request. Aside from not being prompt, the 
response included the disclaimer that ``Secretary Yellen's responses to 
these questions for the record reflect information available as of the 
date of receipt of these questions, June 16, 2022.'' Considering the 
responses were received nearly 8 months after the questions were asked, 
I do not think this disclaimer is appropriate.

    Do you pledge to respond to all questions, including these 
questions, and letters promptly and with information that is as current 
as reasonably available?

    Should you have any difficulty in fully responding to any of my 
requests or questions, will you work with my staff to reach an 
acceptable accommodation rather than providing a woefully outdated or 
incomplete response?

    Answer. The Department of the Treasury is committed to responding 
to congressional inquiries and to providing informative answers to 
questions for the record in a timely manner. As always, my staff is 
available and willing to work with your staff to provide helpful 
information.

    Question. At the hearing, I asked you whether any aspects of the 
OECD Pillar 2 agreement violated our bilateral tax treaty obligations. 
You answered my question by blankly asserting, ``No, there is no 
violation in anything we proposed.'' Your response is yet another 
example of Treasury failing to provide a well-reasoned substantive 
response to legitimate questions and concerns raised by members of the 
Finance Committee. I understand Treasury has asserted that Pillar 2 is 
compliant with tax treaties, but it has failed to provide any legal 
analysis to justify that assertion. This is unacceptable. As I, and 
other congressional Republicans, indicated in a joint letter to you on 
December 14, 2022, ``there is growing consensus among tax experts, 
including former Treasury officials, that the Pillar 2 Under-Taxed 
Profits Rule (UTPR) is inconsistent with our bilateral tax treaties.'' 
Congress has sole tax-writing authority. Treasury must engage in a two-
way conversation with Congress on how Pillar 2 comports with our tax 
treaties. Treasury is not the sole arbiter of whether or not Pillar 2 
is consistent with our international commitments approved by Congress 
through treaty.

    Treasury has justified its position that Pillar 2 is consistent 
with tax treaties by merely pointing to ``a consensus statement by all 
Inclusive Framework members that Pillar 2 was intentionally designed so 
that top-up tax imposed in accordance with those rules will be 
compatible with common tax treaty provisions.'' Please provide the 
analysis on which this statement is based. If no substantive analysis 
has been performed, how can Treasury be certain that Pillar 2 is in 
fact consistent with framework members ``intent'' to be compliant with 
common tax treaty provisions?

    When can Congress expect Treasury to engage in substantive 
discussions with Congress at both the staff and member level on Pillar 
2 and how it comports with our tax treaties?

    Answer. When developing legislative proposals that would affect the 
international provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the Treasury 
Department takes care to closely evaluate the question of the 
compatibility of the proposals with the obligations of the United 
States under its bilateral income tax treaties. The Treasury Department 
has taken the same approach with the development of Pillar 2 and 
believes that the Pillar 2 rules are compatible with U.S. tax treaties. 
The existing statements speak to intent because no analysis can be done 
with respect to a specific country's treaty obligations until that 
country enacts Pillar 2 legislation. Members of the Office of Tax 
Policy are willing to discuss with you and your staff the analysis of 
the compatibility of the Pillar 2 model rules with our treaty 
obligations.

    Question. The last time you appeared before the Finance Committee, 
I asked you two questions for the record pertaining to the treatment of 
business credits under the 15-percent global minimum tax you negotiated 
as part of Pillar 2. As I mentioned, and your response did not dispute, 
ordinary non-refundable business credits are treated less favorably 
under the agreement than refundable credits or direct cash grants. 
Given that the majority of business tax credits in the U.S. are non-
refundable this put the U.S. at a disadvantage with many other members 
of the OECD, including China, that generally provide more refundable 
credit or cash subsidies to businesses.

    My first question asked why you negotiated an agreement that puts 
the U.S. at a disadvantage with many of our major trading partners. 
Your response blamed the Trump administration. This is unacceptable; 
President Biden and his administration were in charge during the bulk 
of substantive negotiations on Pillar 2. Did you, or any of your 
representatives that negotiated Pillar 2, ever raise this disparity as 
a concern with other Framework members? If not, why not?

    Answer. The Pillar 2 rules must take into account credits and other 
tax incentives to be meaningful. At the same time, Pillar 2 was not 
meant to, and does not, address all forms of government spending. The 
Pillar 2 rules therefore require a rule to distinguish tax incentives 
from other forms of government subsidies, and that rule follows the 
financial accounting treatment of credits: nonrefundable credits reduce 
tax expense and refundable credits are like government grants and are 
therefore treated as income.

    The decision to follow the financial accounting distinction between 
refundable and non-refundable tax credits in determining the effective 
tax rate for Pillar 2 purposes was made in the Pillar 2 blueprint, 
which was agreed and published in 2020 during the prior administration. 
Since that decision was made, the Biden administration has worked 
within that framework to protect key U.S. tax incentives. Treasury has 
secured agreement protecting U.S. credits in a number of cases, 
including (i) carryforward of the full benefit of existing stocks of 
credit carryforwards due to the transition rules (ii) protection of 
low-income housing tax credits and green incentives through tax equity 
investments, and (iii) protection of transferable credits and direct 
pay credits in the commentary to the Pillar 2 rules.

    The U.S. Treasury continues to engage multilaterally on this issue 
through the ongoing discussions at the OECD.

    Question. My second question asked for your views on whether direct 
cash subsidies and refundable credits are more desirable than overall 
lower tax rates or non-refundable credits. Instead of addressing my 
question, your response discusses financial accounting rules. Please 
address my question. In your view as an economist, ``are direct cash 
subsidies or refundable credits more desirable than overall lower tax 
rates or non-refundable tax credits? Please explain.

    Answer. There are tradeoffs both in determining whether a credit 
should be provided for an activity and whether that credit should be 
refundable (or take the form of a direct cash subsidy) or non-
refundable. The correct policy solution is therefore context-specific. 
Taken as a whole, the historic international agreement to implement a 
global minimum tax will help end the race to the bottom in corporate 
tax rates and level the playing field for U.S. businesses while 
protecting U.S. workers.

    Question. The IRS budget was supersized by nearly $80 billion in 
the partisan Inflation Reduction Act. The President's FY 2024 budget 
seeks to continue a mandatory stream of funding for the IRS through 
2032 and 2033 with a request for a total of more than $29 billion in 
additional mandatory spending. According to supporting documents of the 
budget request, zero dollars of this new funding would be allocated to 
Taxpayer Services.

    Why isn't any of this new mandatory spending allocated to taxpayer 
services?

    Answer. The funding provided by the IRA will bring the IRS into the 
21st century over the next several years, and it will allow the IRS to 
dramatically improve customer service, modernize decades-old computer 
systems, and improve enforcement with respect to complex partnerships, 
large corporations, and wealthy individuals. Together, this 
transformation will ensure taxpayers receive world class service and 
reduce our deficits by hundreds of billions of dollars.

    However, without further legislative action, the agency will be 
confronted with a fiscal cliff in Fiscal Year 2032. This decline would 
force the IRS to cut back on audits of large corporations and complex 
partnerships and would increase the deficit. The budget provides 
additional funding in Fiscal Years 2032 and 2033 to continue IRA-funded 
enforcement and compliance initiatives and investments. (There is no 
IRA funding in these years.) We also look forward to working with 
Congress to ensure IRS has sufficient funding to provide the world-
class service taxpayers deserve. The FY 2024 discretionary proposes an 
investment that, along with planned IRA spending, will allow the IRS to 
provide an 85 percent LOS in the 2024 filing season.

    Question. The proposed budget requests roughly $29 billion in 
additional mandatory spending for the IRS in FY 2032 and FY 2033. The 
budget allocates that funding mostly to enforcement with some going to 
operations support.

    How many direct civilian full-time equivalent employees and 
reimbursable full-time civilian employees does Treasury project would 
be funded by the additional mandatory request, per budget account, and 
job function?

    How many additional auditors does Treasury project would be hired 
with the additional requested mandatory budget authority?

    Answer. IRS faces an urgent need to replace retiring staff and 
train the next generation of IRS employees. Over the FY 2023 to FY 2025 
time period alone, around 26,000 IRS employees are expected to retire 
or leave the agency. About half those departures (14,500) are expected 
in the taxpayer service area and about 30 percent (8,000) are in the 
enforcement area. These losses equate to roughly 30 percent of the 
employees working at IRS at the end of FY 2022. IRS will need to hire 
to both backfill for these losses and bring on additional staff in 
priority areas where it has historically lacked sufficient resources 
like taxpayer service and enforcement staff focused on wealthy and 
corporate tax evaders. From FY 2022-FY 2025, IRS expects to achieve a 
net increase of about 32,000 new employees, with more than 60 percent 
of that staffing focused on taxpayer services, energy security 
implementation, operations, and IT. (Note: these figures are net of 
expected attrition.) FY 2025 will see IRS ramp up hiring of 
accountants, data scientists, attorneys, and other staff focused on 
high-income individuals, large partnerships, and large corporations.

    Question. The President's budget attributes more than $105 billion 
in deficit reduction stemming from the additional mandatory funding 
requested for the IRS of $14.3 billion in FY 2032 and $14.8 billion in 
FY 2033. Please describe how the increase in revenues was calculated 
and provide the specific calculations and academic research justifying 
them that underlie these assumptions.

    Answer. Estimates for the effect of IRS resource changes on 
enforcement revenue (revenues associated directly with increased audit 
or collection activity) are based on IRS estimates of the return on 
investment (ROI) of enforcement activity. The IRS estimates the ROI for 
most of its enforcement activity based on historical enforcement data. 
The IRS collects this information on an ongoing basis. These 
conventional revenue estimates do not include any deterrent effect of 
increased IRS resources, notwithstanding the evidence that such effects 
exist.

    Question. The IRS was provided nearly $80 billion in mandatory 
spending mostly allocated to enforcement in the Inflation Reduction 
Act. Recently, the IRS missed a deadline set by yourself to provide a 
plan for spending the extra money. However, supporting documents of the 
budget request provides estimates of how the $80 billion in mandatory 
funding will be spent by year throughout the budget window and also 
show outlays in FY 2022 and projected outlays in 2023.

    How have spending decisions up to the present been made and by what 
individuals? Please describe in detail how any of the $80 billion in 
mandatory budget authority has already been spent, and is projected to 
be spent throughout FY 2023.

    Has the administration already decided how the $80 billion in new 
funding will be spent regardless of whatever plan the IRS comes up 
with?

    Will the IRS be able to decide how to spend the $80 billion the IRS 
was provided or will the Treasury Department, the Office of Management 
and Budget, or the Biden administration decide and dictate to the IRS 
how the money will be spent?

    Answer. Shortly after enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act, 
Treasury and the IRS initiated an effort to develop the Strategic 
Operating Plan. The planning process leveraged prior IRS planning 
efforts, including the Taxpayer First Act Report to Congress and new 
thinking around best practices and available technology capabilities. 
Treasury and the IRS also sought input from a wide range of 
stakeholders in tax administration, including IRS employees and their 
representatives, technology experts, small business groups, tax 
professionals, and more. The IRS Strategic Operating Plan (https://
www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3744.pdf) was released on April 6, 2023, 
showing how the IRS will use IRA resources to provide taxpayers with 
world-class customer service and reduce deficits by hundreds of 
billions by pursuing high-income and high-wealth individuals, complex 
partnerships, and large corporations that are not paying the taxes they 
owe.

    In conducting the financial analysis to support this plan, we 
recognized that planning over a 10-year horizon involves considerable 
uncertainty stemming from a rapidly changing labor market, impact of 
productivity gains from overdue technological investments, and business 
process improvements. The ultimate cost of the initiatives outlined in 
this plan will be refined, and the specific estimates of the funding 
required to achieve our vision may change over time. Despite this 
uncertainty over the exact impact of future productivity enhancements 
on the workforce or modernized operations, we have included our full 
aspirations in this plan while we continue to refine specific labor and 
cost projections over the life of the plan.

    Question. As noted, last August you directed the IRS to develop a 
spending plan for the $80 billion in new mandatory budget authority. 
This report has not been delivered and it isn't clear when it will be 
completed.

    When will this report be completed and how are you holding the IRS 
accountable to produce it? Do you pledge to release this report to 
Congress as soon as it is completed?

    Answer. The IRS Strategic Operating Plan was released publicly on 
April 6th. It is available here on IRS's website: IRS Inflation 
Reduction Act Strategic Operating Plan|Internal Revenue Service 
(https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3744.pdf).

    Question. In a letter of August 10, 2022, to then IRS Commissioner 
Rettig regarding the additional $80 billion in mandatory funding 
provided by the Inflation Reduction Act, you wrote, ``I direct that any 
additional resources--including any new personnel or auditors that are 
hired--shall not be used to increase the share of small business or 
households below the $400,000 threshold that are audited relative to 
historical levels.''

    However, a number of open questions remain as to how the IRS will 
implement this directive, including what measure of income will be used 
(i.e., AGI, MAGI, taxable income, etc.) and what metrics will be used 
to determine past and present audit rates.

    Please provide a detailed explanation of how you intend for this 
directive to be implemented, including identifying what measure of 
income and audit metrics will be used to comply.

    Please also describe how you define a ``small business.''

    Would this or any similar directive apply to the additional 
mandatory budget authority requested in the FY 2024 budget request?

    Answer. In August 2022, I requested that then-Commissioner Rettig 
prepare an operational plan for the use of these funds. On April 6, 
2023, Treasury and the IRS released the Strategic Operating Plan, a 
comprehensive roadmap to transform the IRS using Inflation Reduction 
Act resources. The Strategic Operating Plan shows how the IRS will use 
these long-term resources to provide taxpayers with world-class 
customer service and reduce the deficit by hundreds of billions by 
improving enforcement among high-income and high-wealth individuals, 
complex partnerships, and large corporations that are not paying the 
taxes they owe.

    As you note, my letter of August 10, 2022 to then-Commissioner 
Rettig directs the IRS not to raise audit rates above historical levels 
for households making less than $400,000. The Strategic Operating Plan 
complies with that directive. Moreover, the IRS has no plans to 
increase the audit rate for households making less than $400,000. As 
Commissioner Werfel stated when the plan was released: ``We have years 
of work ahead of us where we will be 100-percent focused on building 
capacity for higher-income individuals and corporations. During this 
time, the audit rate for average taxpayers will not be increasing and, 
as a result, we will not come close to hitting or exceeding any 
historic average rate.''

    Question. The IRS Funding Accountability Act authored by Senator 
Thune and me would require the IRS to regularly update Congress on 
audit rates and other enforcement actions by income group.

    Will you direct the IRS to provide quarterly reports to Congress on 
audit rates and enforcement actions? Also please indicate if you would 
be willing to include the following in such reports:

    An analysis identifying historic and current audit rates by income 
group, including a group reflecting the IRS calculation of taxpayers 
earning less than $400,000, beginning in 2018 through the current 
fiscal year.

    A detailed description of what constitutes an ``audit'' to the IRS, 
and whether and how that definition differs from how the National 
Taxpayer Advocate, the Comptroller General of the United States, or the 
Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration defines an audit.

    A categorization of the number of audits for each income group 
which were, correspondence audits, office audits, field audits, audits 
under the Tax Compliance Measurement Program, and any other audits.

    A description of all taxpayer compliance actions or initiatives 
expected to be undertaken using funding provided by the Inflation 
Reduction Act that do not rise to the level of an audit.

    Answer. The IRS annually issues a Data Book that reports audit 
rates by Total Positive Income (TPI) levels. The Data Book has 
historically included audit rate information on taxpayers with TPI of 
$400,000 as part of the $200,000 to $500,000 population segment range. 
The IRS published final audit rates for tax year 2018 in the IRS Data 
Book using this historical format. The IRS is exploring how to provide 
additional information as appropriate in light of my directive on audit 
rates.

    The IRS Data Book also reports the number of examinations conducted 
by correspondence and by field examination type. It does not separately 
report office audits as they are face-to-face audits just like field 
examinations. Similarly, it does not separately report Tax Compliance 
Measurement Program (now called the National Review Program) audits as 
they are field examinations.

    IRS currently conducts education and outreach, and other activities 
to improve voluntary compliance. Using funding provided by the IRA, the 
IRS will build on this existing work to help taxpayers file accurate 
returns and claim the credits and deductions they may be eligible for. 
For example, for the first time, IRS will help taxpayers identify 
potential mistakes before filing and quick fix errors that delay 
taxpayer refunds. By minimizing and quickly correcting errors, improved 
customer service will reduce the burden on working families

    The IRS is committed to an ongoing dialogue with Congress, the tax 
community, and the public on the implementation of the IRS's Strategic 
Operating Plan (Plan). The IRS will prepare an annual update of the 
Plan based on lessons learned, progress made, and any changes needed. 
The IRS will also provide updates at least annually to external 
stakeholders--including Congress and the public--through existing 
reporting and review processes like the Annual Performance Plan and 
Report, the President's budget and related materials, and the IRS Data 
Book. The IRS welcomes the opportunity to discuss progress more 
regularly with Congress and other stakeholders.

    Question. Even though a multiyear reauthorization of surface 
transportation programs was enacted last Congress, the highway trust 
fund is still on a path to insolvency. Based on the most recent 
information provided by CBO, payments from the trust fund will need to 
be delayed during FY 2027. In the avalanche of paper released over the 
past 2 weeks by the administration, I have not found any proposal to 
make the highway trust fund solvent.

    What proposal is the administration considering to either increase 
revenues to or decrease spending from the highway trust fund?

    Answer. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) (enacted as the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act) ensured the highway trust fund 
(HTF) is sufficiently resourced to fund the authorized programs through 
Fiscal Year (FY) 2026. However, a long-term solution to the 
insufficiency of HTF revenues to meet the needed level of investment in 
surface transportation infrastructure was not enacted. The 
administration is committed to working with Congress on a bipartisan 
basis to find a responsible way of funding surface transportation 
programs supported by the HTF in the next authorization, which would 
begin in FY 2027.

    The BIL does include pilot programs and studies designed to inform 
future solutions to HTF solvency. For example, BIL includes $75,000,000 
in funding over 5 years for the Strategic Innovation for Revenue 
Collection program, which requires the Department of Transportation to 
establish a program to test the feasibility of a road usage fee and 
other user-based alternative revenue mechanisms through pilot projects 
at the State, local, and regional level. BIL also requires the 
establishment of a Federal System Funding Alternative Advisory Board, 
which will provide recommendations regarding a National Motor Vehicle 
Per Mile User Fee Pilot. These efforts will provide information on new 
types of revenue collection and could inform future legislation 
regarding how to support the long-term solvency of the HTF.

    Question. In the Public Financial Disclosure Report you completed 
and filed as part of your nomination to be Secretary of the Treasury, 
you noted several million dollars in speaking fees from large financial 
institutions, such as Citi, Barclays, and Credit Suisse. Recently 
Credit Suisse, which paid you $360,000 in speaking fees, was acquired 
by UBS in a deal reportedly brokered by the Swiss Government.

    In your ethics agreement dated December 29, 2020, you acknowledged 
that you would have a ``covered relationship,'' under impartiality 
regulations, for a 1-year period, with the entities that you received 
honoraria from.

    Despite the passage of the 1-year period, will you pledge to seek 
written authorization from ethics authorities should you at some point 
seek to make any decision pertaining to those entities, similar to your 
decision to guarantee Silicon Valley Bank depositors their full 
deposits?

    Answer. I have no financial interests in any of my former clients 
(including firms from which I received one-time honoraria for speaking 
engagements). When I was confirmed, I complied with the requirements 
set forth in my ethics agreement to terminate certain outside positions 
and divest certain financial interests. I have dedicated my career to 
serving and protecting our country. I will always seek to serve the 
good of our country and the good of the American people. I have made 
extensive ethics commitments as requested by the Office of Government 
Ethics and documented in a written agreement, which I have signed. My 
ethics agreement and the President's ethics pledge required me to 
recuse myself for a period of 2 years from participating personally and 
substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in 
which I knew that a former employer or client identified in my ethics 
agreement was a party or represented a party, unless I was first 
authorized to participate by the appropriate ethics official. I 
ensured, and will continue to ensure, that I have a robust screening 
process in place to help implement my recusal obligations. I am mindful 
of not only the legal requirements that govern my conduct but also of 
appearances to ensure that the public has no reason to question my 
impartiality. I believe that these existing rules are appropriate and 
sufficient to protect the public interest.

    I will continue to consult with career Department ethics officials 
on these issues and require everyone who serves with me to ensure 
public service is and will remain a public trust.

    Question. Did you or the Treasury Department have any involvement 
in the deal by which UBS has agreed to acquire Credit Suisse?

    Answer. Treasury maintains regular contact with our international 
counterparts on a variety of issues. Treasury coordinated with the U.S. 
regulatory agencies and its international counterparts, including Swiss 
authorities, to monitor the Credit Suisse situation closely. This is 
the regular course of action in the event of stress at an international 
bank of this size, which can impact both U.S. and global markets. We 
continue to follow the situation closely and support Swiss authorities 
in their efforts to maintain financial stability.

    Question. Given your experience at both Treasury and the Fed, you 
are uniquely positioned to answer why Silicon Valley Bank's failures 
were not caught by regulators. The bank's failures should not have been 
a surprise, and the Fed has been making its aim of raising rates 
crystal clear. Multiple private-sector analysts even raised concerns 
about SVB's practices. But instead of keeping a closer eye up front, 
the San Francisco Fed oversaw a bank run after it was already too late. 
Why weren't Silicon Valley Bank's risks caught beforehand?

    Answer. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(Federal Reserve Board) has issued a detailed report,\11\ to which I 
would refer you, regarding factors that contributed to the failure of 
Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023 and the role of the Federal Reserve, 
which was the primary Federal supervisor for the bank and its holding 
company, Silicon Valley Bank Financial Group.

federal-reserves-supervision-and-regulation-of-silicon-valley-bank.htm.

    Question. After a bank run, the typical answer is for another bank 
to purchase the struggling institution. However, it has been reported, 
and even stated directly on a call between members of the Senate and 
Treasury, that there were offers to buy SVB. SVB was obviously not 
purchased, leading to a whole host of problems we continue to deal with 
today. Were there offers to buy Silicon Valley Bank and, if so, why 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
wasn't an offer to buy SVB accepted?

    Answer. On March 12, 2023, the Department of the Treasury, the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Federal Reserve 
Board took decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy by 
strengthening public confidence in our banking system. After receiving 
a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, 
and consulting with the President, Secretary Yellen approved actions 
enabling the FDIC to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank 
(SVB) in a manner that fully protects all depositors through invocation 
of the systemic risk exception (SRE) in section 13 of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act.\12\ This action, as well as the other actions 
taken on March 12th, have ensured that the U.S. banking system 
continues to perform its vital roles of protecting deposits and 
providing access to credit to households and businesses in a manner 
that promotes strong and sustainable economic growth. Through our 
actions, all depositors of SVB were made whole, and shareholders and 
certain unsecured debtholders were not, and will not be, protected. No 
losses will be borne by the taxpayer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\ 12 U.S.C. 1823(c)(4)(G).

    Since our actions in March, the FDIC has announced an acquirer for 
a significant portion of SVB's assets and liabilities, including 
deposits.\13\ As receiver for SVB, the FDIC is responsible for 
transactions involving failed bank assets and liabilities, including 
the bidding process. Consistent with the FDIC's statutory 
responsibilities, I would refer you to the FDIC for any questions on 
those matters.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2023/pr23023.html.

    Question. Some have attempted to argue that a bailout of depositors 
at SVB will not be borne by the taxpayer. However, it is clear that if 
there are not enough assets in SVB to make wealthy depositors whole, 
regulators will tax banks that have acted more responsibly to make up 
the difference. The argument is that this money will not come from 
taxpayers, because there will be a new ``special assessment'' on banks 
instead. You are a serious economist, and you know as well as I do that 
a tax on banks will be passed to bank customers. Iowa banks, and Iowa 
bank customers, should not be paying for the bad decisions of SVB and 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
their customers with over $250,000 in the bank.

    Is it correct that while tax revenue may not be involved, a bailout 
of Silicon Valley Bank depositors will ultimately be paid for by all 
Americans who are customers of a bank?

    Answer. Under section 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the 
FDIC must recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from 
any action taken or assistance provided using the SRE authority from 
one or more special assessments on insured depository institutions, 
depository institution holding companies, or both, as the FDIC 
determines to be appropriate.\14\ On May 11, 2023, the FDIC issued a 
notice of proposed rulemaking that would implement a special assessment 
to recover the cost associated with protecting uninsured depositors 
following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\15\ 
Under the FDIC's proposal, banking organizations with total assets over 
$50 billion would pay more than 95 percent of the special assessment, 
and no banking organizations with total assets under $5 billion would 
be subject to the special assessment.\16\ The comment period on the 
FDIC's proposed rule ended on July 21, 2023. For more information on 
the proposed special assessment, please refer to the FDIC.

    Question. I have heard from wholesale businesses in Iowa concerned 
about whether laws prohibiting manufacturers of alcohol products from 
providing inducements to retailers are being enforced, particularly in 
light of new entrants into the alcohol market who already produce non-
alcoholic products. I have also heard concerns that alcoholic products 
seen as similar to non-alcoholic products from the same manufacturer 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
are being displayed together.

    Is the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau ensuring that all 
manufacturers of alcohol products are complying with all applicable 
laws and regulations, including those applying to inducements, as 
manufacturers new to the alcohol space bring new products into the 
market?

    Answer. TTB has had numerous conversations with various 
stakeholders regarding their concerns about this issue and has 
repeatedly made clear that the trade practice provisions of the Federal 
Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act) (27 U.S.C. Sec. 205) apply to all 
industry members, irrespective of their tenure in the industry. I 
understand that TTB has invited specific information from concerned 
stakeholders that may lead to investigatory findings. As part of its 
voluntary compliance efforts, TTB has engaged in outreach efforts with 
new members and, in that context, emphasized the proscriptions and 
obligations under the Act, including potential areas for compliance 
concerns. TTB continues to monitor the market to ensure that all 
industry members comply with the trade practice provisions of the Act.

    I would be happy to have TTB discuss the issue in greater depth 
with your staff.

    Question. There are substantial differences in the Congressional 
Budget Office/Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate of the on-
budget effects of last year's reconciliation act (Pub. L. 117-169) and 
the administration's cost estimate of the law entered on the Statutory 
PAY-As-You-Go Act scorecard. The Office of Management and Budget 
informs me that this is largely due to differences between JCT's score 
of the act's revenue provisions and Treasury's estimate of those 
provisions.

    Please provide Treasury's provision-by-provision cost estimate of 
the act's revenue provisions and a crosswalk to JCT's estimate so that 
we can better understand difference in estimates.

    Answer. Treasury is currently focused on implementing the Inflation 
Reduction Act. We expect to release updated tax expenditure estimates 
later this year, as we do every year, that will provide updated 
information on all tax expenditures, including clean energy tax 
incentives.

    Question. As you know, the Social Security Trustees estimate the 
Old-Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund will exhaust in 2034, at 
which point millions of beneficiaries will see their benefits cut 
unless action is taken. Despite claims that the President's budget 
``protects and strengthens'' Social Security, the budget includes no 
proposals to extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund and 
prevent these cuts. In fact, your budget includes a $22 billion 
reduction in Social Security payroll tax revenues relative to baseline 
projections over the 2024-2033 window.

    What policies in the budget are responsible for the decrease in 
Social Security revenues? By how many days does the budget's reduction 
in dedicated Social Security taxes hasten the insolvency of the Social 
Security trust fund and the resulting cuts to benefits?

    Answer. The budget relies on the Social Security Trustees Report 
for characterizing the trust funds' financial outlook, including 
projections of program revenues and costs, including payroll tax 
revenue. The President has made clear he will not support proposals 
from Congress that cut benefits for Social Security.

    Question. The budget proposes redirecting revenue from the net 
investment income tax (NIIT) from the general fund to the Hospital 
Insurance trust fund. How much revenue is shifted from the general fund 
to the Medicare trust fund under the budget?

    Answer. The budget would extend the solvency of the Medicare trust 
fund by more than 25 years. The increase in the Medicare tax rate for 
taxpayers with income above $400,000 raises about $350 billion. Closing 
Medicare tax loopholes saves nearly $400 billion. The prescription drug 
reforms save about $200 billion over the first decade.

    Question. In June of 2021, you defended concerns about the 
President's spending proposals fueling inflation and interest rate 
hikes saying, ``If we ended up with a slightly higher interest rate 
environment, it would actually be a plus for society's point of view 
and the Fed's point of view.'' When you made this comment, inflation 
was 5.4 percent and the Federal funds rate was effectively zero. Since 
that time, inflation hit a 40-year high and the Fed has responded by 
aggressively hiking interest rates. As a result, families and small 
businesses are paying the price by way of higher interest costs on home 
loans and business lines of credit. Moreover, recent bank failures 
highlight how fragile our economy is given rising interest rates and 
decades-high inflation. At the time of your June statement, you were 
advocating in favor of President Biden's multi-trillion-dollar Build 
Back Better plan. Most of the proposals from that failed plan have 
reappeared in the President's budget, despite the fact they were 
rejected by members of his own party as ``too extreme.'' This includes 
$2.5 trillion in new mandatory social welfare spending that would 
inevitably fuel consumer demand and increase inflation pressures. The 
Fed is currently walking a tight-rope in its attempt to increase 
interest rates enough to cool inflation while not causing a recession.

    Do you have any concerns that spending trillions more on social 
programs could cause the Fed to hike interest rates even more, 
potentially tipping us into recession?

    Answer. At the outset of the Biden administration, we faced 
enormous economic challenges, and a generation of workers were looking 
at potential deep economic scarring. We acted swiftly and our economic 
plans allowed us to achieve the strongest economic recovery in modern 
history.

    Today, the administration's budget represents long-term 
investments, like infrastructure, universal pre-K, and affordable 
housing, spent at a gradual pace over the coming decade. The President 
has proposed revenue increases to accompany the planned investments.

    These long-term investments will help expand the supply side of the 
economy, spurring stronger economic growth while reducing price 
pressures.

    That said, the Federal Reserve has primary responsibility for price 
stability. I have a deep appreciation for the Fed's independence and 
will not comment on Fed policy.

    Question. In looking through the President's budget I see a lot of 
proposals that even Democrats rejected when they controlled Congress.

    How much of this budget's proposed $4.7 trillion tax hike is from 
proposals in the failed Build Back Better bill?

    If these tax hikes couldn't pass muster in a Democrat-controlled 
Congress, why does the President expect them to fare any better now 
that there's a Republican-
controlled House?

    Answer. The revenue proposals in the President's budget would 
reduce the deficit, expand support for working families, and ensure the 
wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share. More broadly, the 
President's budget lays out a vision for how to grow the economy from 
the bottom up and the middle out and to give families some breathing 
room, all while reducing the deficit by $2.6 trillion over the next 10 
years. We welcome a conversation with members of Congress about these 
proposals or alternative proposals that members of Congress put 
forward.

    Question. Revenues in this budget climb to 20.1 percent of gross 
domestic product by 2033. That exceeds the post-World War II record of 
20 percent set at the height of the dot-com bubble in 2000. For the 
past 50 years revenues have averaged 17.4 of GDP and never exceeded 19 
percent for more than 3 years in a row. Under the President's budget, 
revenues exceed 19 percent from every year after 2024.

    In your view, are there any negative economic effects from the 
government taking such an exceptionally large bite out of our economy?

    Answer. The administration's agenda represents long-term 
investments, from infrastructure to universal pre-K to affordable 
housing, spent at a gradual pace over the coming decade. The President 
has proposed revenue increases to accompany the planned investments. 
Revenues as a share of GDP are low in the United States relative to 
other advanced economies and it is prudent for Congress to consider 
spending policies that will promote growth and productivity for the 
U.S. economy. The administration has proposed sound tax policy measures 
to pay for programs, including improvements to our country's corporate 
tax code, taxes on wealthy individuals, and enhanced enforcement to 
make sure that people pay the taxes they owe.

    Question. According to a report published by your own Treasury 
Department: ``A progressive tax system is one in which average tax 
rates rise with income. Total Federal taxes are progressive, ranging 
from a combined average rate of less than 1 percent for the bottom 
decile of families to 26 percent for the top decile of families and 32 
percent for the top 0.1 percent in 2022.''

    If Treasury already agrees our tax code is very progressive, with 
the rich paying far more than those at the bottom, how much higher will 
taxes on high-earners have to be before you think they're paying their 
fair share?

    Answer. As you note, Federal taxes are progressive overall. 
However, more must be done to ensure that the wealthy and large 
corporations pay their fair share. The President's budget would impose 
a 25-percent minimum tax on billionaires, reform the taxation of 
capital income, increase the tax rate on buybacks from 1 to 4 percent, 
and strengthen taxation of corporations' foreign profits. Proposals 
like these would address shortcomings of our tax system that allow 
high-income and high-wealth taxpayers to pay less than they should.

    Question. Since your appearance before the Finance Committee to 
discuss the FY 2023 budget proposal, Congress, with this 
administration's support, enacted several ``direct pay'' tax credits 
that operate through the tax code, but are essentially cash grants. 
This includes an Investment Tax Credit for the semiconductor industry 
as part of the CHIPS Act and several credits included in the partisan 
Inflation Reduction Act.

    Given this, is the administration considering providing ``direct 
pay'' for other business credits? If so, which credits would this 
administration support making ``direct pay.''

    Answer. As you note, the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act 
provided legal authority for ``elective payment'' of certain general 
business credits in sections 48D(d) and 6417 of the Internal Revenue 
Code. The Department does not have authority for ``direct pay'' outside 
of these enumerated provisions.

    Question. The President has often voiced concerns about 
corporations paying zero tax. Won't ``direct pay'' tax credits make it 
easier for profitable companies to pay zero tax, or even receive a tax 
refund in excess of any taxes paid?

    Answer. The Department is implementing the ``elective payment'' 
provisions enacted in the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, as 
provided for by the legislation. We cannot speculate at this time as to 
which taxpayers will make an election for such a payment or how that 
will impact their tax liability.

    Question. In addition to expanding ``direct pay'' for several tax 
credits, the IRA broadly made green energy credits ``transferrable.'' 
This means companies that have no tax liability to claim the credit 
against can sell the credit to others, including banks, private equity 
firms, and wealthy investors. Moreover, these credits can be used to 
reduce the Corporate Minimum Book Tax included in the IRA. Do you have 
any concerns that ``transferability'' will result in even more 
profitable corporations and wealthy individuals reducing their tax 
liability to, or near, zero?

    Answer. The Department is implementing the transferability 
provision (section 6418 of the Internal Revenue Code) enacted in the 
Inflation Reduction Act, as provided for by the legislation. We cannot 
speculate at this time as to which taxpayers will purchase the 
specified tax credits or how that will impact their tax liability.

    Question. The FDIC is required to conduct a rulemaking to recover 
losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund and to establish rates to insured 
depository institutions. Under the process, the FDIC is required to 
consider ``the types of entities that benefit from any action taken or 
assistance provided under this subparagraph; economic conditions, the 
effects on the industry, and such other factors as the Corporation 
deems appropriate and relevant to the action taken or the assistance 
provided.''

    What is your best projected loss of assets for Silicon Valley Bank 
and subsequent loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund?

    What is your best projected loss of assets for Signature Bank and 
subsequent loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund?

    Using authority under 12 U.S.C. 1823, do you support an exemption 
for institutions under $10 billion from being assessed a rate in 
recovering losses from Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank?

    Following your emergency determination on systemic risk, how do you 
intend to factor repayment of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund for 
depositors from the People's Republic of China and deposits with 
backing from the Shanghai Pudon Development Bank?

    Answer. On March 12, 2023, the Department of the Treasury, the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System took decisive actions to 
protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our 
banking system. After receiving a recommendation from the boards of the 
FDIC and the Federal Reserve, and consulting with the President, 
Secretary Yellen approved actions enabling the FDIC to complete its 
resolution of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank (Signature) 
in a manner that fully protects all depositors of those institutions 
through invocation of the systemic risk exception (SRE) in section 13 
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \17\ 12 U.S.C. 1823(c)(4)(G).

    Under section 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC 
must recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from any 
action taken or assistance provided using the SRE authority from one or 
more special assessments on insured depository institutions, depository 
institution holding companies, or both, as the FDIC determines to be 
appropriate.\18\ On May 11, 2023, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed 
rulemaking that would implement a special assessment to recover the 
cost associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the 
closures of SVB and Signature.\19\ In the FDIC's proposed rule, it 
estimates that at SVB, for which 88 percent of deposits were uninsured 
at the point of failure, the portion of the total estimated loss of 
$16.1 billion that is attributable to the protection of uninsured 
depositors is $14.2 billion.\20\ The FDIC estimates that at Signature, 
for which 67 percent of deposits were uninsured at the point of 
failure, the portion of the total estimated loss of $2.4 billion that 
is attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors is $1.6 
billion.\21\ Under the FDIC's proposal, banking organizations with 
total assets over $50 billion would pay more than 95 percent of the 
special assessment, and no banking organizations with total assets 
under $5 billion would be subject to the special assessment.\22\ The 
comment period on the FDIC's proposed rule ends on July 21, 2023. For 
more information on the proposed special assessment, please refer to 
the FDIC.

    Question. On March 12th, Iran's foreign minister said that the 
United States and Iran were on the cusp of a ``prisoner swap,'' with 
media reports adding that the exchange could include a U.S. ransom 
payment to Tehran. The administration denied the claim, but the White 
House also released a statement saying that Special Presidential Envoy 
for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens would travel to Qatar on March 13th-
16th to discuss ``wrongful detention and hostage cases worldwide.'' We 
must work diligently to secure the release of all Americans who are 
wrongly detained, but I am concerned that Iran is using these Americans 
as bargaining chips to secure sanctions relief from the Biden 
administration and that you all are prepared to provide that. Sanctions 
relief will have a devastating effect on the terrorism situation in the 
Middle East and provide new liquidity to Iran to sponsor regional 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
terrorism and support Russia in its assault on Ukraine.

    Is sanctions relief on the table for any negotiation to secure the 
release of American hostages?

    Answer. We defer to the State Department on questions related to 
consular matters.

    Question. Has your Department drafted or are you actively drafting 
the necessary licenses, authorizations, and other materials to permit 
and facilitate any transaction with Iran regarding blocked funds held 
in the U.S. or other jurisdictions?

    Answer. In general, OFAC does not comment on, or make public, 
license applications or requests for authorizations.

    Question. The GAO reported that 33 percent of the applications and 
23 percent of the software instances in use at the IRS are legacy 
systems. I asked now-
Commissioner Werfel during his confirmation process about his systems 
modernization priorities.

    What are your top priorities for systems modernization at the IRS?

    Answer. One of the keys to unlocking the IRS Americans deserve is 
delivering secure, accurate, and real-time data to taxpayers about the 
status of their returns and correspondence. The IRS Strategic Plan lays 
out the roadmap to get there. The plan discusses how IRS will use IRA 
funding, along with its annual discretionary budget, to deliver 
cutting-edge technology, data, and analytics to operate more 
effectively. This includes priorities like: adopting modern systems to 
support real-time tax process; modernizing IT infrastructure; improving 
access to and use of data, while ensuring continued security and 
privacy of taxpayer data; and harnessing data and analytics to drive 
operations and decision-making.

    Question. How do you think the $80 billion for the IRS in the 
Inflation Reduction Act should be used for systems modernization?

    Answer. IRA funding--along with sufficient IRS discretionary 
funding for IT modernization--will enable IRS to make dramatic 
improvements to our IT infrastructure. The multiyear nature of the 
funding will allow us to successfully plan and deliver. We will design 
and deliver modern technology platforms that center around data and 
applications, with natively integrated protective and detective 
security controls. For example, in the first 5 years of the 10-year 
plan, the IRS will eliminate the possibility of future paper backlogs 
that have delayed taxpayer refunds by digitizing forms and returns when 
they are received and transitioning to fully digital correspondence 
processes. This was an acute issue during the pandemic and we are 
committed to changing the technology to ensure it doesn't happen again. 
IRS will also retire outdated components of our core tax processing 
systems, replacing them with modern platforms that will enable 
transactions to be processed quickly and securely. More broadly, on 
cybersecurity the IRS will continue to follow all cybersecurity 
standards issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, 
the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA), and the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The IRS continuously validates 
its security posture through third party assessments, including threat 
hunts and red teams conducted by CISA and NSA. The certainty provided 
by these resources will permit the holistic, system-wide upgrades IRS 
has been unable to do. For too long, IRS technology has been beholden 
to a funding cycle that has limited the agency's ability to capitalize 
technology investments. Resources for upgrades have also been diverted 
time and again to cover basic operations, limiting the IRS's ability to 
manage and modernize its technology.

              Questions Submitted by Hon. Robert Menendez
    Question. You and I have spoken before about the need to increase 
Hispanic representation at the Treasury Department, and that starts 
with targeted recruitment efforts, which have been sorely lacking. 
Treasury did not allocate a single dollar for recruitment and hiring 
during fiscal years 2018 through 2020.

    What changes have you made to Treasury's hiring and recruitment 
plans since taking over at Treasury?

    Answer. In light of quantitative data and empirical evidence 
illustrating opportunities for improvement in Treasury's recruitment 
and hiring endeavors, the Department has taken immediate and strategic 
actions to improve our recruitment and retention outcomes. In Objective 
5.1 of our FY 2022-2026 strategic plan, we have committed to the 
modernization of our operations to enable Treasury to enhance our 
ability to hire and retain a workforce that reflects the diversity of 
citizens in the communities we serve.

    We have established the Treasury Recruitment Service through a 
combined $1.1 million investment in recruitment and hiring this fiscal 
year, supported by financial contributions from each Treasury bureau. 
The Treasury Recruitment Service will enable the Department to connect 
and engage with top-tier talent under a unified Treasury brand, 
representing each bureau and using data-driven, innovative outreach 
strategies emphasizing improving applicants' knowledge of the Federal 
hiring process.

    Our immediate priorities this fiscal year under our Treasury 
Recruitment Service initiative include the following:

          1.  Establishing a unified Treasury brand and marketing 
        cadence to foster awareness, build interest, and create 
        creative marketing campaigns. We will highlight the benefits of 
        working at Treasury, inform applicants of how to apply, and 
        ultimately encourage a diversified array of individuals to 
        apply to vacancies at the Department of the Treasury;
          2.  Improving accessibility and awareness of Treasury job 
        opportunities by establishing a dedicated careers page 
        (www.treasury.gov/jobs);
          3.  Establishing a full-time Treasury presence on leading 
        business and 
        employment-focused social media platforms;
          4.  Closely collaborating and aligning recruitment efforts 
        with Treasury's recently established Office of Diversity, 
        Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility;
          5.  The solicitation and cross-functional analysis of our 
        bureaus' FY24 staffing plans to ensure their strategic hiring 
        actions align with overall mission needs, suggested actions 
        from our Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and 
        Accessibility, and optimized use of hiring flexibilities and 
        recruitment/talent outreach strategies;
          6.  Establishing a Treasury Recruitment Council, consisting 
        of recruitment personnel across bureaus to identify best 
        practices, common challenges and opportunities to collaborate 
        within the Department;
          7.  Developing an active live outreach program to effectively 
        target underrepresented communities by creating awareness, 
        interest, educating applicants on the application process, and 
        development of centers of influence who can partner with 
        Treasury and refer applicants;
          8.  Training for bureau recruitment teams to develop and 
        enhance current skillsets; and
          9.  Establishing a departmental ambassador program to ensure 
        recruitment is conducted with a common message and brand. The 
        program will also allow for more diversity among those that are 
        representing the bureaus and when conducting recruiting 
        activities.

    Question. What impact have these changes had on the representation 
of Hispanics at Treasury?

    Answer. Treasury does not establish hiring goals or quotas based on 
race, ethnicity, or sex. However, Treasury utilizes benchmarks for 
comparison of demographic representation, i.e., Hispanic representation 
within the Federal Government workforce (9.8 percent), within the 
civilian labor force (13 percent), and within the relevant civilian 
labor force (10 percent). In FY 2022, the representation of Hispanic 
employees across the entire Treasury Department (including headquarters 
and bureaus) was 14 percent, which is above all three benchmarks.

    It is also noteworthy that the representation of people of color 
among the senior executive ranks in Treasury Headquarters (Departmental 
Offices) has increased substantially to 20 percent of all executives, 
largely attributable to political non-
career appointments made under the current administration. One third 
(33 percent) of the political non-career executives are people of 
color, including 11 percent who are Hispanic.

    Question. In the Boechler v. Commissioner case, the IRS fought all 
the way to the Supreme Court--and lost 9 to 0--to argue that a taxpayer 
loses if they file their petition with tax court even 1 day late. But 
by my count, the IRS's report to you on how they will spend the $80 
billion is 5 weeks late and counting.

    When will this report be publicly available, and will the IRS stop 
fighting taxpayers on deadlines until they start meeting theirs?

    Answer. The Strategic Operating Plan was released publicly on April 
6th, and is available on IRS's website at: IRS Inflation Reduction Act 
Strategic Operating Plan|Internal Revenue Service (https://www.irs.gov/
about-irs/irs-inflation-reduction-act-strategic-operating-plan).

    Question. The new IRS Commissioner reports to you. Have you 
discussed with him any of the longstanding unimplemented 
recommendations from the National Taxpayer Advocate that you want to 
see him move forward on? If so, which ones?

    Answer. The National Taxpayer Advocate has long recommended service 
improvements to improve the taxpayer experience. The IRS agreed with 
many recommendations but lacked the resources to implement. Now, with 
IRA funding, the IRS will move forward with many high-priority taxpayer 
service improvements. For example:

            For several years, the NTA has recommended the IRS improve 
        service levels and decrease wait times for taxpayers calling 
        into the phone lines. Due to IRA funding, the IRS was able to 
        hire 5,000 customer service representatives for filing season 
        2023. During filing season, these assistors consistently 
        provided a high level of service, answering between 80-90 
        percent of calls with average wait times of less than 5 
        minutes. Due to sustained IRA funding and assumed IRS receives 
        sufficient annual discretionary funding, the IRS will continue 
        to maintain high levels of service and short wait times to 
        ensure taxpayers get the help they need when they need it.
            In 2021 and 2022, the NTA recommended that the IRS improve 
        status tracking tools like Where's My Refund? to improve 
        transparency. The IRS previously agreed to implement if budget 
        and resources allowed. Now, with IRA resources, the IRA will 
        improve status tracking tools for filing season 2024 with 
        continued improvements over the next 5 years to include 
        personalized information about the status of refunds, return 
        processing, audits, and more.
            Each year since 2016, the NTA has urged improvements to 
        taxpayer online accounts, including recommendations that the 
        IRS make payment histories available, launch business online 
        accounts, make more notices available online, incorporate 
        taxpayer alerts, enable secure two-way communications, and 
        more. The IRS agreed with many of the recommendations but 
        lacked the resources to implement. Due to IRA funding, the IRS 
        will significantly enhance online accounts to deliver these and 
        other long-sought capabilities to individuals, business, and 
        tax professionals.
            In 2020, the NTA recommended the IRS enable e-filing of 
        all forms. The IRS agreed to study this recommendation and 
        adopt increased e-filing capabilities depending on resources. 
        Now, with IRA resources, the IRS will move forward with making 
        all forms available for e-filing.

    Question. The Treasury Inspector General has a report estimating 
that getting every tax form able to be electronically filed would save 
the IRS $200 million a year in data entry costs and avoid keypunch 
errors. Save $200 million, not cost. Is 100 percent of tax forms online 
a top 3 priority, a top 10 priority, or not even in the top 10?

    Answer. Our goal is to make Modernized e-File available whenever 
possible and encourage taxpayers to file electronically whenever 
possible to minimize errors and reduce processing time. This will save 
taxpayers and the IRS time and money and allow us to process returns 
and refunds more quickly for taxpayers. Specifically, it is now our 
goal that by the 2025 filing season, the IRS will achieve paperless 
processing, which means digitizing all paper-filed returns as soon as 
they are received. Achieving this milestone will enable up to 76 
million paper documents to be processed digitally every year. For the 
2024 filing season, we are giving taxpayers new tools that will help 
them go paperless should they choose. Being able to digitally submit 
their correspondence and responses and other paper means taxpayers will 
have the potential to digitally submit up to 125 million paper 
documents each year.

    Question. As a member of both this committee and the Foreign 
Relations Committee--which is responsible for reviewing international 
treaties--I am concerned with the continued lack of transparency around 
the OECD tax agreement.

    Despite repeated requests, you have provided no detailed 
information to this committee on how the OECD agreement would be 
implemented. Two years ago, you suggested the agreement could be 
implemented through a tax treaty, domestic legislation, or 
congressional executive agreement.

    While it has always been clear that Pillar 1 requires changes to 
every one of our existing bilateral tax treaties, in our December 
letter, we highlighted treaty concerns with Pillar 2. Treasury ignored 
that letter and never provided a response. However, the latest OECD 
guidance makes the assertion that Pillar 2 is consistent with our tax 
treaties, with no additional analysis.

    Will you commit to providing this committee with your analysis? 
Will you further commit to provide a detailed implementation plan for 
both Pillar 1 and 2, including the legislative changes and treaty 
changes that would be required?

    Answer. When developing legislative proposals that would affect the 
international provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the Treasury 
Department takes care to closely evaluate the question of the 
compatibility of the proposals with the obligations of the United 
States under its bilateral income tax treaties. The Treasury Department 
has taken the same approach with the development of Pillar 2 and 
believes that the Pillar 2 rules are compatible with U.S. tax treaties.

    Members of the Office of Tax Policy are willing to discuss with you 
and your staff the analysis of the compatibility of the Pillar 2 Model 
Rules with our treaty obligations.

    The administration's Fiscal Year 2024 budget, released on March 9, 
2023, includes proposals that would align U.S. tax rules with the OECD 
Pillar 2 agreement. Negotiations regarding Pillar 1 are ongoing but are 
expected to result in an agreement to draft a multilateral convention 
that would, if signed and ratified, make the necessary changes to our 
treaties necessary to comply with any Pillar 1 agreement. Any Pillar 1 
agreement and related multilateral convention would be made available 
to Congress for consultation.

    Question. The bipartisan objective that justified entering the OECD 
negotiations was the elimination of discriminatory unilateral measures 
that unfairly target U.S. companies. The U.S. Trade Representative 
determined that digital services taxes (DSTs) discriminate against U.S. 
companies and are inconsistent with international tax principles as 
well as our current bilateral tax treaties. However, rather than use 
the tools at our disposal, the administration's agreement allows 
foreign countries who moved early on to enact DSTs (essentially, 
rewarding first movers on bad behavior) to continue to collect DSTs 
with no threat of section 301 measures, and U.S. companies will only 
receive a credit for taxes paid if Pillar 1 is implemented by the end 
of 2023. The U.S. Senate is not going to agree to a multilateral 
convention by the end of this year--particularly given the lack of 
meaningful, congressional consultation by this administration. Further, 
even the OECD recently acknowledged that this timeline is unrealistic 
given the amount of work that remains to be done under Pillar 1, and 
the deadline has already shifted to 2024 at the earliest.

    What happens to DSTs given that Pillar 1 will not be implemented by 
the end of 2023? Don't the terms of the agreement you've reached allow 
foreign countries to collect discriminatory DSTs from U.S. companies 
with impunity?

    Answer. The administration views the Pillar 1 negotiations as the 
best path forward on resolving the issues, as any agreed upon solution 
under the Pillar 1 framework will prohibit discriminatory DSTs. We are 
working to bring those negotiations to conclusion as soon as possible 
and to ensure protections for American business against discriminatory 
DSTs for any interim period before the Pillar 1 provisions can be 
approved by Congress.

    Question. Financial services entities, including the insurance 
companies, are awaiting additional guidance with regards to calculating 
the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) as enacted by the 
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As Treasury continues the development 
of implementation regulations in calculating the CAMT, I would like to 
call your attention to the need for additional guidance to address 
issues related to the treatment under the CAMT of items that are marked 
to market for financial statement purposes. Under generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP), corporations, including insurance 
companies, are required to include the change in unrealized gains and 
losses for certain securities in net income. This effectively requires 
the unrealized gains and losses from publicly traded equities and 
financial instruments to be included within net income on insurers' 
GAAP financial statements.

    What is the expected timeline for regulatory guidance from Treasury 
regarding the application of section 56A(c)(2)(C) to explicitly exclude 
unrealized gains and losses from AFSI?

    Answer. On February 17, 2023, Treasury and the IRS released Notice 
2023-20, which provided interim guidance on the treatment of certain 
unrealized gains and losses for CAMT purposes to help avoid substantial 
unintended adverse consequences to the insurance industry. On September 
12, 2023, Treasury and the IRS released Notice 2023-64, which among 
other things clarified that unrealized gains and losses reflected in 
Other Comprehensive Income are excluded from adjusted financial 
statement income. Treasury and the IRS are actively studying the extent 
to which other unrealized gains and losses from publicly traded 
equities and financial instruments are excluded from adjusted financial 
statement income under section 56A(c)(2)(C) or other provisions under 
section 56A and expect to issue guidance on this issue in proposed 
regulations or other guidance as part of Treasury's efforts to 
implement the CAMT.

    Question. House Republicans are holding the U.S. economy and 
millions of workers hostage by threatening not to raise the debt limit 
unless Democrats agree to massive cuts to critical government programs. 
Certainly, default would be catastrophic: according to a recent 
analysis, even a days-long debt ceiling breach would trigger a 
recession and cost nearly 1 million Americans their jobs--or, if it 
dragged on for months, cost roughly 7 million jobs and push 
unemployment beyond 8 percent.\24\ But caving into Republican demands 
for massive cuts would be no less disastrous: austerity would trigger a 
year-long recession and put 2.6 million people out of work.\25\ It 
would also diminish gross domestic product (GDP) by almost 3 percent 
over the next decade, the equivalent of putting the entire U.S. economy 
on pause for a full year.\26\ As part of a recent congressional 
inquiry, Federal agencies revealed that even in the short term, capping 
fiscal year (FY) 2024 spending at FY 2022 levels would cut roughly a 
quarter of Federal childcare slots, push nearly 30,000 people out of 
opioid use disorder treatment (including veterans), eliminate hundreds 
of thousands of public housing vouchers, and cut the Social Security 
Administration (SSA) workforce by 6,000, adding months to wait times 
for retirees and people with disabilities.\27\

    Both of these options are non-starters. Congress must reject House 
Republicans' hostage tactics and vote to raise the debt ceiling 
cleanly--just as Republicans did three times for President Trump.\28\

    Do you agree that the two options Republicans are presenting--
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
default and massive spending cuts--are economically dangerous?

    Answer. Yes. Both options are bad for economic growth and will 
raise unemployment. Had Congress not acted to suspend the debt limit, a 
default would have caused severe hardship for American families, 
potentially leading to the loss of millions of jobs and trillions in 
household wealth, and higher financing costs for American taxpayers for 
years to come. Congress has a duty to ensure that the United States can 
pay its bills on time, and the full faith and credit of the United 
States must not be used as a bargaining chip.

    Question. Why would a default risk a recession and cost millions of 
Americans their jobs?

    Answer. Even approaching a default could cause an increase in 
borrowing costs and other financial stress, while an actual default 
would spark a financial crisis and global downturn of unknown but 
substantial severity. We have learned from past debt limit impasses 
that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt 
limit can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence, raise 
short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers, and negatively impact the 
credit rating of the United States.

    Question. Why would slashing government spending also risk a 
recession and cost millions of Americans their jobs?

    Answer. According to analysis by Moody's Analytics,\29\ government 
spending reductions would cut essential government services that tend 
to go to lower-income households that have high marginal propensities 
to consume, meaning that they are more likely to quickly spend the 
benefits they receive. Cutting this vital spending means not only harm 
to the households who need this support, but it also means less 
spending in the economy more generally, which means fewer jobs.

    Question. Who are the types of workers that would lose their jobs 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
in the event of massive spending cuts? Would it be the wealthy?

    Answer. According to academic research,\30\ job losses in 
recessions tend to particularly affect Black and Hispanic workers, 
youth, and those with less education. These groups tend to have lower 
incomes and wealth and are thus particularly negatively impacted by job 
loss.

    Question. Any serious conversation about reducing the national debt 
must start with rebalancing our tax system, and not with how to inflict 
economic pain on working people. Republicans conveniently ignore their 
role in growing our national debt through shoveling massive tax breaks 
to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations. Thanks to 
corporate handouts like the Trump-era Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, 
which increased the deficit by more than $1.5 trillion,\31\ 
billionaires today pay just 3 percent of their wealth each year in 
Federal income taxes \32\--less than half the rate that 99 percent of 
America pays. Giant corporations have lobbied their way from paying 6 
percent of the cost of running our country to paying about 1 percent of 
the cost of running our country.\33\ And Republicans don't want to stop 
there--their latest proposals would add another $3 trillion to the 
national debt, while raising costs for working families in the 
process.\34\ In contrast, President Biden's budget for FY 2024 would 
reduce the deficit by nearly $3 trillion by imposing a new minimum tax 
on billionaires; raising the domestic corporate tax rate and doubling 
the tax on corporations' foreign earning; quadrupling the stock buyback 
tax rate; and rolling back the 2017 income and capital gains tax breaks 
for the wealthy.\35\ And it would accomplish all of this without 
raising taxes on a single American making less than $400,000 per year; 
in fact, the proposed budget would lower the tax burden on working 
families by restoring the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit 
expansion.\36\

    Moreover, Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Dr. Mark Zandi 
testified earlier this month before the Senate Banking, Housing, and

wealthiest individuals and corporations would have marginal economic 
impacts, and certainly not the significant hits to growth and 
employment that Republicans' proposed spending cuts would have.\37\ And 
in a 2021 analysis of President Biden's Build Back Better plan--which 
contained similar tax provisions to those in the President's FY 2024 
budget--Dr. Zandi found that the investments President Biden has 
proposed would grow our economy, and that ``the financial benefits of 
that added growth largely accrue to hard-pressed lower-income and less-
wealthy Americans.''\38\

    Can you explain why the President's proposals to raise taxes on the 
wealthiest individuals and largest corporations would not have the same 
negative impact on the economy as Republicans' proposals for massive 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
spending cuts would?

    Answer. Legislation enacted in recent years has laid a foundation 
for long-term economic growth through an approach that I call modern 
supply-side economics. This approach seeks to boost the economy's 
productive capacity by expanding the workforce and increasing 
productivity. In just the past 2 years alone, Congress passed three 
transformational laws consistent with this approach: a generational 
investment in infrastructure; a historic expansion of American 
semiconductor manufacturing; and the largest investment in clean energy 
in our Nation's history.

    The President's budget would further build on our economic progress 
by making smart, fiscally responsible investments. These investments 
would be more than fully paid for by requiring corporations and the 
wealthiest to pay their fair share. Fiscal discipline remains a central 
priority in our budget. We've proposed a minimum income tax of 25 
percent on taxpayers with wealth in excess of $100 million. We've also 
proposed an increase of the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from the 
current 21 percent. Finally, we've proposed reforms that would 
implement the global minimum tax deal. This new regime will end a race 
to the bottom in corporate taxation--and raise crucial revenue for 
essential investments like those proposed in the President's budget.

    On the spending side, we suggest additional investments to boost 
our long-term growth potential. This includes improving the 
availability of high-quality child care, providing free and universal 
pre-school, and boosting the supply of affordable housing. We also 
propose restoring the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit 
expansions that were enacted in 2021 but have since expired.

    Modern supply-side economics is far more promising than the old 
supply-side economics, which I see as having been a failed strategy for 
increasing growth. Significant tax cuts on capital have not achieved 
their promised gains. In contrast, modern supply-side economics 
prioritizes labor supply, human capital, public infrastructure, R&D, 
and investments in a sustainable environment. These focus areas are all 
aimed at increasing economic growth and addressing longer-term 
structural problems, particularly inequality.

    Question. Congress passed the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) in 
2021 to end the abuse of anonymous U.S. shell companies by requiring 
entities to name their true, ``beneficial'' owner to a directory 
administered by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), 
housed within your department. However, FinCEN's proposed second and 
third rules, regarding access to the database and the beneficial 
ownership information (BOI) disclosure form, respectively, impose 
serious roadblocks to key potential users of the database and provide 
an ``escape hatch'' for businesses to simply choose not to comply with 
the law.

    The proposed access rule veers away from the goal of the CTA by 
requiring State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies to obtain a 
court order before they can access the database (as opposed to simply 
receiving ``authorization'' from a ``court officer''). In addition, the 
rule does not clarify whether FinCEN will include mechanisms to verify 
the data that is submitted by covered persons and entities. Finally, 
the proposed rule that contains the form for collecting and reporting 
BOI gives businesses subject to the CTA the option to state that they 
are essentially ``unable to obtain'' the BOI--providing the millions of 
individuals and businesses subject to the CTA's BOI disclosure 
requirements with a clear path for evading its core requirements.

    These rules, as they are currently written, deviate from both 
congressional intent and the letter of the CTA. They will make it more 
difficult for companies to disclose the information required by the law 
and will hamper the database's intended users--law enforcement, 
financial institutions, and more--from accessing and utilizing this 
information efficiently and effectively.

    On what grounds (statutory, regulatory, or any other) did FinCEN 
include a requirement that law enforcement agencies obtain a ``court 
order'' to access the BOI database?

    Answer. The CTA provides that a State, local, or Tribal law 
enforcement agency may receive beneficial ownership information (BOI) 
from FinCEN if a court of competent jurisdiction has authorized the 
agency to seek that information in a criminal or civil investigation. 
The proposed requirement that a State, local, or Tribal law enforcement 
agency submit a copy of a court order as evidence of the agency's court 
authorization was intended to facilitate FinCEN's audit and oversight 
of requests for BOI, consistent with the requirements of the CTA, and 
FinCEN specifically sought comments on the scope of this provision as 
part of its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. FinCEN is carefully 
considering the public comments as part of an active rulemaking 
process. Because we are in an active rulemaking process, we are unable 
to comment on any particular policy decision at this time.

    Question. Is FinCEN planning to include measures to verify the data 
that companies submit?

    Answer. Commenters to the beneficial ownership rulemakings have 
highlighted the importance validating beneficial ownership information 
(BOI) to ensure that the BOI database is accurate, complete, and highly 
useful. FinCEN has engaged in substantial consultations regarding 
validation of BOI. FinCEN's validation of BOI presents several complex 
challenges, including information availability, technical requirements, 
resource constraints, and legal considerations. FinCEN continues to 
review the options available for it to validate BOI within the legal 
constraints of the CTA.

    Question. For what reason did FinCEN include an option in the BOI 
form proposed rule for companies not to comply with the CTA?

    Answer. The ``unknown'' checkbox was not intended to provide any 
exception to the reporting obligation. To be clear, reporting companies 
have a regulatory obligation to submit accurate and complete beneficial 
ownership and company applicant information to FinCEN. The proposal to 
include an ``unknown'' checkbox was intended to facilitate compliance 
and enforcement by creating a mechanism for FinCEN to track incomplete 
reports and to follow up regarding missing information.

    As part of its obligations under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 
FinCEN issued a notice and request for comment on the BOI reporting 
form. At the conclusion of the comment period, FinCEN received valuable 
feedback on the form from a variety of stakeholders. FinCEN is working 
to issue an updated BOI reporting form as soon as possible. As part of 
that process, FinCEN is reviewing all comments received in response to 
the notice and is focused on the concerns raised about the unknown 
checkbox. We are considering all options, including removal of the 
check box, to ensure that it is clear that reporting companies have an 
obligation to submit all BOI and to ensure that the form can be used in 
a way that maximizes FinCEN's ability to conduct compliance and 
enforcement reviews.

    Furthermore, we intend to ensure that the reporting company user 
experience makes clear that the reporting company submitter is required 
to ensure that reports are accurate and complete and that all 
information is submitted.

    Question. Given these shortcomings, do you believe either or both 
of these proposed rules to be consistent with Congress's intent in 
passing the CTA as well as the language of the CTA as written?

    Answer. FinCEN's priority is to implement a highly useful 
beneficial ownership reporting regime, while minimizing burden on 
reporting companies (particularly small businesses) and financial 
institutions, as required by the CTA. FinCEN is carefully reviewing 
comments received in response to the BOI access Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking and the associated BOI reporting form. Because FinCEN is 
engaged in an active rulemaking process, we are unable to comment 
further on any particular policy decision at this point.

    Question. Do you agree that businesses being able to opt out of 
answering 14 out of 16 questions in the BOI collection form will 
significantly diminish the utility of the database? Why or why not?

    Answer. To be clear, reporting companies have a regulatory 
obligation to submit accurate and complete beneficial ownership and 
company applicant information to FinCEN. Willful violation of that 
requirement can result in civil and criminal penalties. Furthermore, we 
intend to ensure that the reporting company user experience makes clear 
that the reporting company submitter is required to ensure that reports 
are accurate and complete.

    Question. With the passage of Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act 
(IRA) last August, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) received roughly 
$80 billion in new funding, with around $3 billion earmarked for 
addressing the agency's significant backlog (3.8 million returns during 
the 2022 filing season) and improving taxpayer services. The IRS 
urgently needed the new cash infusion: Republican attacks have left the 
agency chronically underfunded and short-staffed, leading to longer 
wait times and possibly disastrous consequences for families and 
businesses in need of immediate assistance.

    Many tax filers have faced significant delays in receiving their 
refunds in the past several tax filing seasons. For example, through 
conversations with my constituents and with the National Taxpayer 
Advocate, I have learned that it is common for applicants for the 
Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) to have to wait more than 18 
months to receive the tax credit, potentially forcing some businesses 
to close their doors for good and put even more Americans out of a job.

    Already, the IRA funding has helped the IRS to make significant 
progress in addressing the backlog. At the start of 2022, the agency 
had a backlog of 4.7 million individual unprocessed paper returns; by 
late December of the same year, 4 months after the IRA's passage, that 
figure had dropped to roughly 400,000, or more than 90 percent.\39\

2023 tax season stronger, taxpayer advocate says,'' Kate Dore, January 
12, 2023, https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/12/irs-to-start-2023-tax-season-
stronger-taxpayer-advocate-says.html.

    Do you agree that the new IRS funding included in the IRA has 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
helped, and will continue to help, address these issues?

    Answer. Yes. The IRA funding, along with IRS's annual discretionary 
funding, has been essential for improving service this filing season, 
including working down IRS's paper inventory. The IRS has processed all 
original paper and electronic individual and business returns received 
prior to January 2023. In addition, the three IRS processing centers 
have been opening mail within normal time frames all year. IRA funding 
allowed IRS to hire over 5,000 new customer service representatives, 
bringing phone staffing to its highest level ever. During filing 
season, these IRS live assistors consistently answered 80-90 percent of 
customer calls, up from 18 percent last filing season, and average call 
wait times are down to 4 minutes, down from 30 minutes last filing 
season. In addition, IRS has used new resources to deploy online tools 
that save taxpayers time and money, and create efficiencies. For 
example, IRS launched a new tool that allows small businesses to e-file 
their 1099 forms for the first time. The IRS hit a major milestone in 
adopting new technology that will enable the automation of the scanning 
of millions of individual paper returns, scanning 480,000 940 forms as 
of April 7th. In the first quarter of the year, IRS scanned 80 times 
more returns than in all of 2022. Taxpayers are now able to respond to 
notices online and have new online filing options. Until this filing 
season, when taxpayers received notices for things like document 
verification, they had to respond through the mail. Taxpayers are now 
able to respond to nine of the most common notices for credits like the 
Earned Income and Health Insurance Tax Credits online, saving them time 
and money. Finally, IRS created a direct-deposit refund option for 
1040X amended returns. These refunds were previously only available by 
paper check, delaying taxpayers' receipt of their refund.

    Question. What is the IRS's plan to continue to address the backlog 
and shorten wait times for families and businesses?

    Answer. Assuming IRS continues to receive sufficient discretionary 
resources--including funding to cover inflationary costs and additional 
needs in taxpayer services, operations, and IT--along with the planned 
IRA spending, IRS will fundamentally transform its services and 
technology. In the first 5 years of the 10-year plan, the IRS will 
eliminate the possibility of future paper backlogs that have delayed 
taxpayer refunds by digitizing forms and returns at the point of 
receipt and transitioning to fully digital correspondence processes. 
This was an acute issue during the pandemic and IRS is committed to 
changing the technology to ensure it doesn't happen again. The agency 
has already made progress on this front, by scanning 480,000 940 forms 
as of April 7th. As a result of hitting this milestone, IRS is 
expanding scanning to the most used forms, the 1040 and 941. The IRS is 
on track to scan millions of returns this year, which will result in 
faster processing and refunds. While the IRS will preserve paper filing 
options, digitizing all returns at the outset will allow IRS to focus 
on customer service, not processing paper. In addition, the IRS is 
working to fully staff all Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) 
nationwide by next year and ensure TACs are open for additional hours 
that help working families access in-person service, such as by having 
some TACs open on Saturdays during filing season. IRS will also 
continue to improve phone and other services for taxpayers building off 
the successes of this filing season.

                                 ______
                                 
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young
    Question. As I mentioned during the hearing, President Biden has 
repeatedly promised not to raise taxes on anyone making less than 
$400,000 per year. As you stated during the hearing, ``there certainly 
are aspects of TCJA that, if they sunset, would impact households where 
taxpayers are earning under $400,000.'' However, the President's FY 
2024 budget does not extend any provision of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act (TCJA) past 2025.

    During the hearing, you committed to providing my office with a 
list of TCJA tax rates and other provisions that, if they were to 
expire in 2025 as currently scheduled, would violate President Biden's 
pledge not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000.

    Can you please provide a comprehensive list of such tax rates and 
other provisions? Please note that during the hearing, I requested that 
you provide me with this list within 2 weeks of the hearing date.

    Answer. The TCJA is a complex piece of legislation with many 
interrelated parts, including both gross tax increases and tax cuts. 
The net effect of the expiring provisions on a household depends on how 
all expiring provisions are addressed. The President will work with the 
Congress to address the 2025 expiration of portions of the TCJA, and 
focus tax policy on rewarding work not wealth, based on the following 
guiding principles. The President:

            Opposes increasing taxes on people earning less than 
        $400,000 and supports cutting taxes for working people and 
        families with children to give them more breathing room;
            Opposes cutting taxes for the wealthy--either extending 
        tax cuts for the wealthy or bringing back tax breaks that would 
        benefit the wealthy; and
            Supports additional reforms to ensure that wealthy people 
        and big corporations pay their fair share, so that America pays 
        for the continuation of tax cuts for people earning less than 
        $400,000 in a fiscally responsible manner and addresses the 
        problematic sunsets created by President Trump and 
        congressional Republicans.

    Question. The President's FY 2024 budget proposes raising the top 
Federal income tax base rate to 39.6 percent, and applying this rate to 
all income above $450,000 for joint filers, $425,000 for heads of 
households, and $400,000 for single filers. These dramatically lowered 
top income tax rate brackets are a serious mismatch with current law 
income tax rate brackets and would likely also violate the President's 
pledge to not raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000.

    The last time the 39.6-percent rate was reinstated was in 2013, 
during President Biden's tenure as Vice President. Was the 2013 bracket 
structure the brackets Treasury assumed are in place when you made your 
estimates regarding this FY 2024 proposal? If not, please provide the 
specific brackets that you assumed were in place when you made your 
estimate.

    Answer. The President's budget would increase the top marginal tax 
rate to 39.6 percent. The 39.6-percent rate would apply to taxable 
income over $450,000 for married individuals filing a joint return, 
$400,000 for unmarried individuals (other than surviving spouses), 
$425,000 for head of household filers, and $225,000 for married 
individuals filing a separate return. After 2024, the thresholds would 
be indexed for inflation using the C-CPI-U, which is used for all 
current thresholds in the tax rate tables. The proposal would make no 
changes to the tax rates or brackets that apply below these thresholds.

    Question. When you came before the Senate Finance Committee last 
year regarding President Biden's FY 2023 budget, I asked you in a 
question for the record why the Biden administration had agreed to 
rules at the OECD that would substantially diminish the value of our 
research and development (R&D) tax credit. In your answer, you stated 
that when determining the effective tax rate, ``[f]ailure to account 
for credits and other incentives would render the minimum tax 
meaningless.'' My concern is that by the design of the current Pillar 2 
agreement, we are directly disincentivizing U.S. companies from 
engaging in important activities in the U.S. by allowing outside 
countries to increase taxes on U.S. entities for U.S. activities.

    Can you please detail what efforts the U.S. Treasury Department 
made to protect U.S. interests by advocating that U.S. tax credits 
should not decrease a company's effective minimum tax rate in the U.S. 
under the Pillar 2 agreement?

    Answer. The Pillar 2 rules must take into account credits and other 
tax incentives to be meaningful. At the same time, Pillar 2 was not 
meant to, and does not, address all forms of government spending. The 
Pillar 2 rules therefore require a rule to distinguish tax incentives 
from other forms of government subsidies, and that rule follows the 
financial accounting treatment of credits--nonrefundable credits reduce 
tax expense and refundable credits are like government grants and are 
therefore treated as income.

    The decision to follow the financial accounting distinction between 
refundable and non-refundable tax credits in determining the effective 
tax rate for Pillar 2 purposes was made in the Pillar 2 blueprint, 
which was agreed and published in 2020 during the prior administration. 
Since that decision was made, the Biden administration has worked 
within that framework to protect key U.S. tax incentives. Treasury has 
secured agreement protecting U.S. credits in a number of cases, 
including (i) carryforward of the full benefit of existing stocks of 
credit carryforwards due to the transition rules (ii) protection of 
low-income housing tax credits and green incentives through tax equity 
investments, and (iii) protection of transferable credits and direct 
pay credits in the commentary to the Pillar 2 rules.

    The U.S. Treasury continues to engage multilaterally on this issue 
through the ongoing discussions at the OECD.

    Question. Why were other countries, like Great Britain, more 
successful in protecting their tax incentives? How do their successes 
instruct your Department's approach to renegotiations on this subject?

    Answer. The U.S. Treasury continues to represent U.S. interests in 
the ongoing multilateral negotiations at the OECD, which is the best 
forum for protecting those interests.

    Question. The current OECD Pillar 2 agreement will be especially 
problematic for S corporation ESOPs, which were intentionally created 
by Congress to encourage employee ownership and help workers build 
retirement savings. Pillar 2 would create an entity-level tax on 
multinational S ESOPs, even when they are employee-owned and their 
owners are already taxed at ordinary income rates when they realize the 
value of their interests. I am concerned that this tax will negatively 
impact employee-owners and their retirement accounts directly.

    What will the Treasury Department do to ensure the OECD does not 
move forward with a global minimum tax that includes employee-owned S 
corporations?

    Answer. The U.S. Treasury continues to participate in the ongoing 
negotiations at the OECD. We are engaged on this issue and are pursuing 
a multilateral resolution.

    Question. As you know, I have worked with my Senate Finance 
Committee colleague, Senator Hassan, on restoring research and 
development (R&D) tax incentives. We recently reintroduced our American 
Innovation and Jobs Act which, among other things, would make full and 
immediate expensing of R&D expenditures under section 174 permanent. 
The bill already enjoys considerable bipartisan support, and our list 
of bipartisan cosponsors continues to grow.

    Do you agree it is important to support domestic R&D activities 
here in the United States to remain competitive against our 
international rivals, including China, yes or no?

    Will you commit to supporting the Hassan-Young American Innovation 
and Jobs Act, yes or no? Why or why not?

    During the recent House Ways and Means Committee hearing on the 
President's FY 2024 budget, when asked whether you would commit to 
helping Congress restore section 174 R&D expensing, you said you were 
``working with Congress to put something more effective in place.'' 
Please provide specifics detailing how you have been working with 
Congress on this vague alternative. As a leader on the R&D issue, I for 
one have not heard from you or anyone at Treasury on this alternative 
proposal.

    Please provide specific details on this ``more effective'' R&D 
proposal you and President Biden are hoping to implement in lieu of 
section 174 and other R&D incentives.

    Answer. Research and development are one of many types of 
investments that are critical drivers of competitiveness and long-run 
growth. The President's budget proposes a range of investments to boost 
our long-term growth potential, including improving the availability of 
high-quality childcare, providing free and universal pre-school, and 
boosting the supply of affordable housing.

    When it comes to tax policy, the President strongly believes that 
any bill that cuts taxes for big corporations must also cut taxes for 
working people and families with children. As you note, the budget 
proposes to repeal the foreign-derived intangible deduction and use the 
revenues raised to encourage R&D.

    Question. In response to my question for the record following last 
year's budget hearing, when asked about the apparent leak of 
confidential information to ProPublica, you stated: ``As I have said 
publicly, I remain deeply concerned about this matter. In an effort to 
get to the bottom of what happened, I ensured that it was immediately 
referred to the Office of Inspector General, the Treasury Inspector 
General for Tax Administration, and the Department of Justice. These 
authorities conduct their investigations independently.''

    Do you still agree with your above statement, yes or no?

    I received your above response to my question for the record on 
February 10, 2023, via the Senate Finance Committee majority staff. 
Since February 10, 2023, have you requested a status update on the 
ProPublica investigation from the Office of Inspector General, the 
Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, and/or the 
Department of Justice, yes or no?

    If your response to the previous question is ``yes,'' please 
provide details as to the dates and relevant offices for each and every 
status update request you have placed during that time. If your 
response to is ``no,'' please explain why you have not requested a 
status update despite ``remain[ing] deeply concerned about this 
matter.'' If you requested status updates prior to February 10, 2023, 
please provide details on those inquiries.

    At any point following the June 8, 2021, publication of the 
ProPublica article that contained the confidential taxpayer data, have 
you or anyone on your staff briefed the Senate Finance Committee 
chairman or majority staff on the matter, yes or no? If your answer is 
``yes,'' please provide dates and attendee details.

    Answer. As you know, I ensured this matter was immediately referred 
to the appropriate authorities, which conduct their investigations 
independently. I would refer you to the Treasury Inspector General for 
Tax Administration and the Department of Justice for more information, 
including about any briefings provided to Congress.

    Question. Section 107 of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 
established the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC) 
codified in section 48D of the Internal Revenue Code. Briefly, the AMIC 
allows for a 25-percent credit on any qualified property ``integral to 
the operation of [an] advanced manufacturing facility'' for which the 
``primary purpose is the manufacturing of semiconductors or 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment.'' The Department released a 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) on March 23, 2023.

    How is the U.S. Treasury Department, together with the Internal 
Revenue Service, engaging with stakeholders and Congress to determine 
eligibility requirements for the AMIC, specifically as it pertains to 
eligibility for the semiconductor ecosystem at large and congressional 
intent?

    Answer. Earlier this year, in coordination with the Department of 
Commerce and the Department of Defense, Treasury and the IRS published 
a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with proposed rules to implement the 
section 48D investment tax credit and the special ``applicable 
transaction'' recapture rule in section 50(a)(3). The NPRM expressly 
requested public comment on issues like the scope of terms like 
``semiconductor,'' and we will carefully consider public feedback and 
work with interagency partners before issuing final rules.

    Question. How is the delay in issuing final regulations affecting 
the semiconductor industry (e.g., in terms of project delays)? What 
steps are being taken to remedy the negative impact of this delay on 
the industry?

    Answer. Consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, the 
proposed regulations are going through a rulemaking process that 
provides the public notice and an opportunity to comment before we 
issue final regulations. We will carefully consider public feedback and 
work expeditiously with interagency partners to issue final 
regulations.

    Question. Ultimately, how does the delay in issuing final 
regulations affect the primary goal of the CHIPS Act--securing 
America's global leadership in the production of next generation chips?

    Answer. Based on public reporting of announcements by semiconductor 
manufacturers that are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in 
U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, we are not aware of any such impacts.

    Question. What steps are the Treasury Department and the Internal 
Revenue Service taking to ensure that future regulations are issued 
swiftly?

    Answer. Consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, the 
proposed regulations are going through a rulemaking process that 
provides the public notice and an opportunity to comment before we 
issue final regulations. We will carefully consider public feedback and 
work expeditiously with interagency partners to issue final 
regulations.

    Question. Last year, my Democratic colleagues enacted a 1-percent 
excise tax on stock buybacks as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. At 
the time, my constituents expressed concern over the lack of clarity as 
to how that tax would be applied to preferred stocks. While there was 
initially an indication that the IRS would exempt preferred stocks from 
this excise tax, recently released guidance indicates that the IRS is 
going to take the position that the tax does apply. This interpretation 
seems out of line with the general intent of the new law.

    As an example, let's say a corporation has outstanding common stock 
that is traded on an established securities market, as well as 
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock that is not traded on an 
established securities market. The preferred stock is stock for Federal 
tax purposes. On January 1, 2023, that same corporation redeems the 
preferred stock pursuant to its terms. Under some practitioners' 
interpretation of the IRS's Notice 2023-2,\40\ redemption by the 
corporation of its mandatorily redeemable preferred stock would be 
considered a repurchase and is therefore taxed as such.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \40\ https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-02.pdf.

    Do you agree with the interpretation that, pursuant to the IRS's 
initial guidance, the 1-percent excise tax would apply in this 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
circumstance, yes or no? Why or why not?

    Answer. Yes, Notice 2023-2 explicitly addresses the fact pattern 
that you described above in order to provide clarity as to how the 
excise tax applies to preferred stock, although this initial guidance 
only describes regulations that the Treasury Department and the IRS 
intend to propose.

    Example 1 of Notice 2023-2 \41\ provides a fact pattern in which a 
corporation (Corporation X) has outstanding common stock that is traded 
on an established securities market, as well as mandatorily redeemable 
preferred stock that is not traded on an established securities market. 
Example 1 further provides that (i) the Corporation X preferred stock 
is stock for Federal tax purposes, and (ii) on January 1, 2023, 
Corporation X redeems the preferred stock pursuant to its terms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \41\ Notice 2023-2, section 3.09(1) (entitled ``Example 1: 
Redemption of Preferred Stock'').

    Based on this fact pattern, Example 1 provides the following 
analysis and conclusion: ``The redemption by Corporation X of its 
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock is a repurchase because (i) 
Corporation X redeemed an instrument that is stock for Federal tax 
purposes (that is, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock issued by 
Corporation X), and (ii) the redemption by Corporation X is a 26 U.S.C. 
Sec. 317(b) redemption.''\42\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \42\ Id.

    Accordingly, the proposed regulations described in Notice 2023-2 
would provide that a redemption by a corporation of its mandatorily 
redeemable preferred stock is a repurchase and therefore is taxed as 
such under the excise tax statute. However, we will carefully consider 
public feedback in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act as 
our rulemaking process on the implementation of this excise tax 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
proceeds.

    Question. If your answer to part (a) is ``yes,'' please explain 
whether you believe this outcome is consistent with the Inflation 
Reduction Act.

    Answer. The first rule of the excise tax statute provides that the 
tax is imposed on ``the fair market value of any stock of the 
corporation which is repurchased by such corporation during the taxable 
year.''\43\ Similarly, that statute defines a ``repurchase'' to mean 
``a redemption within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. Sec. 317(b) with regard 
to the stock of a covered corporation'' and any transaction determined 
to be economically similar to such a redemption.\44\ Congress's 
decision not to provide any exception for preferred stock (or any other 
type of stock) is confirmed by 26 U.S.C. Sec. 4501(f)(2), in which 
Congress explicitly requested the Treasury Department to consider 
regulations or other guidance to address special classes of stock and 
preferred stock.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \43\ 26 U.S.C. Sec. 4501(a) (emphasis added).
    \44\ 26 U.S.C. Sec. 4501(c)(1) (emphasis added).

    Notice 2023-2 mirrors the excise tax statute by defining the term 
``stock'' in relevant part to mean ``any instrument issued by a 
corporation that is stock or that is treated as stock for Federal tax 
purposes at the time of issuance.''\45\ To implement Congress's request 
that the Treasury Department consider special treatment for preferred 
stock and other special classes of stock, Notice 2023-2 provides the 
following request for public comments:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \45\ Notice 2023-2, section 3.02(25) (providing a definition for 
the term ``stock'') (emphasis added).

        Are there circumstances under which special rules should be 
        provided for redeemable preferred stock or other special 
        classes of stock or debt (including debt with features that 
        allow the debt, whether by the issuer, the holder, or 
        otherwise, to be converted into stock)? If so, please provide 
        objectively verifiable criteria that such special rules should 
        incorporate to provide certainty for taxpayers and the IRS.\46\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \46\ Notice 2023-2, section 6.01(1) (under the heading entitled 
``Comments Regarding Rules Included in Notice'').

    The Treasury Department will carefully consider such public 
comments in developing the proposed excise tax regulations, which will 
also go through a public notice-and-comment process before any final 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
regulations are issued.

    Question. Though I disagree wholeheartedly with much of the 
administration's proposed FY 2024 budget, there are some areas where we 
are in agreement on expanding affordable housing production through the 
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)--a bipartisan, effective, and 
ready-to-go tool. I have heard from businesses, families, and 
individuals in urban, suburban, and rural areas about the need for more 
affordable housing and the benefits of LIHTC in their communities.

    However, despite estimates showing a shortage of 7 million 
affordable homes to serve our constituents in need, we let a cut to 
LIHTC, the primary tool for affordable housing production, stand with 
the expiration of the 12.5-percent increase at the end of 2021. To meet 
this crisis head-on, I am proud to partner with Senator Cantwell, 
Chairman Wyden, and this year, upon Senator Portman's retirement, our 
new Senate Finance Committee colleague Senator Blackburn, to expand 
LIHTC resources and enact bipartisan and effective policies to increase 
affordable housing supply. These reforms include increasing LIHTC 
allocations and increasing access to LIHTC equity by reducing the 
number of bonds needed for shovel-ready developments.

    All of this is critical to any progress we have made working 
together on the CHIPS and Science Act, because if the workforce housing 
is not there we will be unable to fuel the critical expansion of 
manufacturing in our Nation.

    Will you commit to working with us to enact a much-needed expansion 
of affordable housing production that will directly impact not only 
working families struggling with their budgets, but also help 
businesses, farms, and communities on the workforce housing front to 
enhance local economic growth?

    Answer. As you know, the administration's revenue proposals include 
two items that are also mentioned in your question: an increase in the 
potential credits available for allocation and a reduction in the level 
of tax-exempt financing needed for bond-derived LIHTC eligibility. We 
welcome the opportunity to work with you to see these necessary changes 
enacted.

    Question. In addition to the administration's support of the LIHTC 
program, I also appreciated the inclusion of a proposal in line with 
Senator Cardin's and my Neighborhood Homes Investment Act (NHIA). Our 
bill creates a Federal tax credit that covers the cost between building 
or renovating a home in distressed areas and the price at which they 
can be sold. The legislation also caps the price of sales for each home 
to ensure that they are affordable housing options in the community. 
The NHIA would also help existing homeowners in these neighborhoods to 
renovate and stay in their homes.

    Do you agree that it is important to help revitalize communities 
from within so that distressed neighborhoods are not permanently 
subjected to blight?

    Will you commit to working with me and Senator Cardin as we seek to 
pass our Neighborhood Homes Investment Act into law this Congress?

    Answer. The President's budget includes a proposal for a 
Neighborhood Homes Credit. We would welcome further engagement with 
your staff on this important issue.

                                 ______
                                 
                Prepared Statement of Hon. Todd Young, 
                      a U.S. Senator From Indiana
    Secretary Yellen, I want to voice my continued frustration over the 
way the administration has handled the OECD Pillar 2 negotiations. Over 
the years, on a bipartisan, bicameral basis, tax writers have focused 
on what the agreement would mean for the U.S. tax base. After all, if 
we get that wrong and the U.S. tax base is harmed, we would be enabling 
further Federal fiscal deterioration. Our constituent workers, job-
creating businesses, and taxpayers will pay the price if we get it 
wrong. Yet here we are, almost a year and a half after your fellow 
finance ministers and you reached agreement on Pillar 2, and you have 
not made the case that U.S. workers and the job-creating businesses 
that employ them will be better off if the U.S. Congress and the world 
adopt Pillar 2. I am not asking whether a Joint Committee on Taxation 
table would show revenue gains if we enacted the Biden administration's 
more onerous per-country Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) 
system. I am asking, would we undermine the incentive to invest and 
grow jobs in the U.S. if this regime were enacted globally?

    Suffice it to say, I have my doubts in large part because the 
Pillar 2 Under-Taxed Profits Rule (UTPR) would uniquely disadvantage 
American workers and job-
creating businesses by providing our trading partners with the 
political blessing to tax the U.S. activity of U.S. companies. This 
would directly undercut our sovereignty as a Nation and the legislative 
power of tax writers to provide bipartisan and well-established 
economic incentives, such as the research and development tax credit or 
even incentives such as transferable renewable energy credits enacted 
just a few months ago, solely on the votes of our friends on the other 
side of the aisle.

    These and more look to be wiped out under Pillar 2. When asked last 
week during the House Ways and Means hearing, you said those incentives 
would be lost under the current Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax (BEAT) 
regime, but I have checked and that is at best a theoretical risk that 
exists only in the minds of an academic with no practical experience. 
U.S. companies can and will generally take great pains to avoid losing 
credits to the BEAT. But the only way they could avoid losing credits 
to the UTPR is to stop doing the R&D or investing in renewable energy 
sources. I cannot understand why we allowed other countries to protect 
their incentive regimes while throwing ours to the wolves. How is that 
possibly in America's interest?

    Madam Secretary, with all due respect, I think the Treasury 
Department has gotten the policy process backward. Instead of 
proceeding from longstanding bipartisan, bicameral principles I've 
mentioned, they have negotiated an agreement at odds with those 
principles and now want to force Congress to act. But this Congress 
will do no such thing. Our negotiating partners need to know that while 
they may have bested us in the negotiations, this Congress will not 
blindly ratify such an awful result. If there is to be any hope of 
Congress acting on these matters, it will only be after Treasury 
returns to the negotiating table to work out an agreement that actually 
serves the interest of U.S. workers and their employers, and I would 
urge you to do so at the first available opportunity. Failing that, I 
fear we are headed to more tax and trade disputes that will only 
undermine our collective economic interests.

                      Statement of Michael Bindner

Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo, thank you for the opportunity 
to address Secretary Yellen's testimony.

The national debt is the issue of hour. The limit needs to be 
abolished. It was only established because previously, each bond issue 
was authorized by Congress. That day has long since passed. In the 
first attachment, we detail who owns the national debt by income class.

The bottom 60% of households own the debt held by Social Security as 
beneficiaries. The top 0.1% of households hold about a third of managed 
fund and bond assets, with the rest of the top 10% holding half and the 
bottom 90% one sixth. Federal Reserve, bank and long-term assets are 
divided in roughly half between the top 20% and the bottom 80%.

If the debt were to be defaulted on, a great deal of the damage would 
be to the top 10% of households. Managed fund and bond holders in the 
top 1% would take the biggest hit. The debt itself is owed by income 
tax payers. For every dollar of income tax paid, nineteen are owed. 
Those who pay and those who owe are the same people: capitalists. 
Without the national debt, leveraging private banking, debt and 
investment--especially the intrinsically worthless assets in secondary 
markets--is impossible. This is far above historical averages and is 
unsustainable. The answer to this is increased revenue.

Inflation is the other big economic issue of the day. As Dodd-Frank 
rules are being restored, the NYMEX oil trading floor is again an 
honest market. Prices will go down and stay down to reflect the real 
availability of oil and gas. This is not to say that higher interest 
rates were not needed, but this is only so that families, especially 
retirees, earn a fair return on their savings.

How the pain of inflation is borne is more important. Households making 
under the 90th percentile have been losing ground for almost half a 
century, while incomes above that amount have increased on a regular 
basis.

The source of inequality, aside from abandoning the 91% top marginal 
tax rate, is granting raises at an equal percentage rather than by an 
equal amount. When the 91% rate was repealed, incomes were fairly 
equal, so it was not an issue.

The federal government plays an outsized role in how salaries are 
determined through percentage-based cost of living adjustments to 
government workers, beneficiaries, government contractors. The 
government can change this with the stroke of a pen. The private sector 
will follow suit with a higher minimum wage, adequate child tax credits 
(as described below) and paying individuals in training from ESL to 
community college the minimum wage to purse their studies.

From here on in, adjust for cost of living on a per dollar an hour 
rather than on a percentage basis (or dollars per month or week for 
federal beneficiaries). Calculate the dollar amount based on inflation 
at the median income level. No one gets more dollars an hour raise no 
one gets less dollars per hour in increases. Increase the minimum wage 
as above and consider decreasing high end salaries paid to government 
employees and contractors. Even without decreases, simply equalizing 
raises will soon reduce inequality. Why is this necessary?

Prices chaise the median dollar. The median dollar of income is 
actually at the 90th percentile, rather than the 77th percentile (which 
is about where the median is). This strategy will reduce inflation in 
both the long and short terms as prices adjust to decreases in higher 
salaried income.

Let me repeat this--prices chase income dollars, not income earners.

On the tax side, limit bracket indexing in the same manner--by dollars 
per bracket, not percentages.

Staying in economics, last year we projected another depression, which 
we define as a drop-in asset values below what is borrowed against 
them. We no longer have to project, given the falling price of 
valueless crypto-currency and the realization that mortgage backed 
securities holding single family rental properties are nowhere near 
what they are rated--and that they have been hidden in exchange traded 
funds. The recent bank failures are only the beginning.

Aside from raising income taxes to end the production of junk assets, 
the answer to the coming depression is enactment of the proposed 
increase in the child tax credit proposed by the President, although we 
would make it $1,000 per month and phase it out from the median income 
to the 90th percentile.

Some of the bipartisan opposition in the Senate came from those who 
consider direct subsidies from the IRS to have the ``stink of 
welfare.'' I advise such Senators in both parties to raise the minimum 
wage so that no one is having to work just to receive this credit and 
that the best way to distribute the credit is with wages.

For middle-income taxpayers whose increased credits are less than their 
annual tax obligation, a simple change in withholding tables is 
adequate. Procedures are already in place to deliver refundable credits 
to larger families.

Employers can work with their bankers to increase funds for payroll 
throughout the year while requiring less money for their quarterly tax 
payments (or estimated taxes) to the IRS. The main issue is working out 
those situations where employers owe less than they pay out. This is 
especially true for labor intensive industries and even more so for low 
wage employers. A higher minimum wage would make negative quarterly tax 
bills less likely. Again, no one should have to subsist mainly on their 
child tax payments.

Please see the second attachment for the latest version of our tax 
reform proposals, beginning with how the proposed rates are 
synergistic. Note that we propose ending corporate income taxes and 
reporting of business income on personal income taxes. We replace these 
with consumer paid goods and services and employer-paid subtraction 
value-added taxes.

The income tax for individuals with wage, dividend and salary income 
under $75,000 would be eliminated. A surtax on employer paid 
subtraction value-added taxes would be paid by employers, but filing of 
individual income tax would not occur until $450,000 of salary, 
interest paid and dividend income. Spousal income would not be included 
in this levy.

We propose ending the capital gains tax on short- and long-term income 
and full repeal of the inheritance (death) tax with an asset value 
added tax. There are two debates in tax policy: how we tax salaries and 
how we tax assets (returns, gains and inheritances). Shoving too much 
into the Personal Income Tax mainly benefits the wealthy because it 
subsidizes losses by allowing investors to not pay tax on higher 
salaries with malice aforethought, tax transactions, not people!

Ending the machinery of self-reporting of asset returns also puts an 
end to the Quixotic campaign to enact a wealth tax. To replace revenue 
loss due to the ending of the personal income tax (for all but the 
wealthiest workers and celebrities), enact a Goods and Services Tax. A 
GST is inescapable. Those escapees who are of most concern are not 
waiters or those who receive refundable tax subsidies. It is those who 
use tax loopholes and borrowing against their paper wealth to avoid 
paying taxes.

For example, if an unnamed billionaire or billionaires borrow against 
their wealth to go into space, creating such assets would be taxable 
under a GST or an asset VAT. When the Masters of the Universe on Wall 
Street borrow against their assets to avoid taxation, having to pay a 
consumption tax on their spending ends the tax advantage of gaming the 
system.

This also applies to inheritors. No ``Death Tax'' is necessary beyond 
marking the sale of inherited assets to market value (with sales to 
qualified ESOPs tax free). Those who inherit large cash fortunes will 
pay the GST when they spend the money or Asset VAT when they invest it. 
No special estate tax is required and no life insurance policy or 
retirement account inheritance rules will be of any use in tax 
avoidance.

Tax avoidance is a myth sold by insurance and investment brokers. In 
reality, explicit and implicit value-added taxes are already in force. 
Individuals and firms that collect retail sales taxes receive a rebate 
for taxes paid in their federal income taxes. This is an 
intergovernmental VAT. Tax withheld by employers for the income and 
payroll taxes of their labor force is an implicit VAT. A goods and 
services tax simply makes these taxes visible.

Should the tax reform proposed here pass, there is no need for an IRS 
to exist, save to do data matching integrity. States and the Customs 
Service would collect credit invoice taxes, states would collect 
subtraction VAT, the SEC would collect the asset VAT and the Bureau of 
the Public Debt would collect income taxes or sell tax-prepayment 
bonds. See the last attachment for details on this.

Until tax reform occurs, IRS Statistics on Income tax tables should be 
adjusted for inflation to get a better idea of the distribution of 
income. Between $50,000 and $100,000, there should be five groups. 
Between $100,000 and $200,000, there should at least be four so that 
the border between the fourth and fifth quintiles can be more 
adequately expressed. Every tax wonk in the nation will appreciate 
this.

Thank you, again, for the opportunity to add our comments to the 
debate. Please contact us if we can be of any assistance or contribute 
direct testimony.

Attachment One--Debt Ownership as Class Warfare, February 16, 2022

Visibility into how the national debt, held by both the public and the 
government at the household level, sheds light on why Social Security, 
rather than payments for interest on the debt, are a concern of so many 
sponsored advocacy institutions across the political spectrum.

Direct household attribution can be made by calculating direct bond 
holdings, income provided by Social Security payments and secondary 
financial instruments backed with debt assets for each income quintile.

Responsibility to repay the debt is attributed based on personal income 
tax collection. Payroll taxes create an asset for the payer, so they 
are not included in the calculation of who owes the debt. Using 2019 
tax data and the national debt as of COB February 15th, 2022. the ratio 
is $19 of debt owed for every dollar of income tax paid. Note well that 
the adjusted gross income of the bottom 80% is just over that garnered 
by the top 10%.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]


The bottom 80% of taxpaying units hold few, if any, public debt 
assets in the form of Treasury Bonds or Securities or in accounts 
holding such assets and only take home one-third of adjusted gross 
income. Their main national debt assets are held on their behalf by the 
Government. They are owed more debt than they owe through taxes. The 
next 10% (the middle class), hold more in terms of long-term 
investments and mutual fund and bond assets. They hold a bit under a 
fifth of social insurance assets.

The top 10% pay more than half of income taxes (the dividing line is 
about 97.5%--and has been for a while). Asset shares within the top 10% 
are estimated using the same breakdown as the entire population, that 
is, the top 1% hold 54% of Federal Reserve and Long-Term Investment 
Assets and 77% of mutual funds and bonds as held by the top 10%. A 
similar fraction is used to estimate holdings by the top 0.01%--which 
is consistent to how much income they receive (note that I did not say 
earn.

This illustration shows who benefits the most from having a national 
debt, therefore who has the most to lose through default. The relative 
shares of debt ownership, however, are current as reflected in the 2019 
Federal Reserve Survey.

Attachment Two--Tax Reform, Center for Fiscal Equity, March 24, 2023

Synergy: The President's Budget for 2024 proposes a 25% minimum tax on 
high incomes. Because most high-income households make their money on 
capital gains, rather than salaries, an asset value added tax replacing 
capital gains taxes (both long and short term) would be set to that 
rate. The top rate for a subtraction VAT surtax on high incomes (wages, 
dividends and interest paid) would be set to 25%, as would the top rate 
for income surtaxes paid by very high-income earners. Surtaxes 
collected by businesses would begin for any individual payee receiving 
$75,000 from any source at a 6.25% rate and top out at 25% at all such 
income over $375,000. At $450,000, individuals would pay an additional 
6.25% on the next $75,000 with brackets increasing until a top rate of 
25% on income over $750,000. This structure assures that no one games 
the system by changing how income is earned to lower their tax burden.

Individual payroll taxes. A floor of $20,000 would be instituted for 
paying these taxes, with a ceiling of $75,000. This lower ceiling 
reduces the amount of benefits received in retirement for higher income 
individuals. The logic of the $20,000 floor reflects full time work at 
a $10 per hour minimum wage offered by the Republican caucus in 
response to proposals for a $15 wage. The majority needs to take the 
deal. Doing so in relation to a floor on contributions makes adopting 
the minimum wage germane in the Senate for purposes of Reconciliation. 
The rate would be set at 6.25%.

Employer payroll taxes. Unless taxes are diverted to a personal 
retirement account holding voting and preferred stock in the employer, 
the employer levy would be replaced by a goods and receipts tax of 
6.25%. Every worker who meets a minimum hour threshold would be 
credited for having paid into the system, regardless of wage level. All 
employees would be credited on an equal dollar basis, rather than as a 
match to their individual payroll tax. The tax rate would be adjusted 
to assure adequacy of benefits for all program beneficiaries.

High-income Surtaxes. As above, taxes would be collected on all 
individual income taxes from salaries, income and dividends, which 
exclude business taxes filed separately, starting at $400,00 per year. 
This tax will fund net interest on the debt (which will no longer be 
rolled over into new borrowing), redemption of the Social Security 
Trust Fund, strategic, sea and non-continental U.S. military 
deployments, veterans' health benefits as the result of battlefield 
injuries, including mental health and addiction and eventual debt 
reduction.

Asset Value-Added Tax (A-VAT). A replacement for capital gains taxes 
and the estate tax. It will apply to asset sales, exercised options, 
inherited and gifted assets and the profits from short sales. Tax 
payments for option exercises, IPOs, inherited, gifted and donated 
assets will be marked to market, with prior tax payments for that asset 
eliminated so that the seller gets no benefit from them. In this 
perspective, it is the owner's increase in value that is taxed. As with 
any sale of liquid or real assets, sales to a qualified broad-based 
Employee Stock Ownership Plan will be tax free. These taxes will fund 
the same spending items as high income and subtraction VAT surtaxes. 
There will be no requirement to hold assets for a year to use this 
rate. This also implies that this tax will be levied on all eligible 
transactions.

The 3.8% ACA-SM tax will be repealed as a separate tax, with health 
care funding coming through a subtraction value added tax levied on all 
employment and other gross profit. The 25% rate is meant to be a 
permanent compromise, as above. Any changes to this rate would be used 
to adjust subtraction VAT surtax and high income surtax rates 
accordingly. This rate would be negotiated on a world-wide basis to 
prevent venue seeking for stock trading.

Subtraction Value-Added Tax (S-VAT). Corporate income taxes and 
collection of business and farm income taxes will be replaced by this 
tax, which is an employer paid Net Business Receipts Tax. S-VAT is a 
vehicle for tax benefits, including

      Health insurance or direct care, including veterans' health care 
for non-
battlefield injuries and long-term care.
      Employer paid educational costs in lieu of taxes are provided as 
either 
employee-directed contributions to the public or private unionized 
school of their choice or direct tuition payments for employee children 
or for workers (including ESL and remedial skills). Wages will be paid 
to students to meet opportunity costs.
      Most importantly, a refundable child tax credit at median income 
levels (with inflation adjustments) distributed with pay.

Subsistence-level benefits force the poor into servile labor. Wages and 
benefits must be high enough to provide justice and human dignity. This 
allows the ending of state administered subsidy programs and 
discourages abortions, and as such enactment must be scored as a must 
pass in voting rankings by pro-life organizations (and feminist 
organizations as well). To assure child subsidies are distributed, S-
VAT will not be border adjustable.

As above, S-VAT surtaxes are collected on all income distributed over 
$75,000, with a beginning rate of 6.25% and replace income tax levies 
collected on the first surtaxes in the same range. Some will use 
corporations to avoid these taxes, but that corporation would then pay 
all invoice and subtraction VAT payments (which would distribute tax 
benefits). Distributions from such corporations will be considered 
salary, not dividends.

Invoice Value-Added Tax (I-VAT). Border adjustable taxes will appear on 
purchase invoices. The rate varies according to what is being financed. 
If Medicare for All does not contain offsets for employers who fund 
their own medical personnel or for personal retirement accounts, both 
of which would otherwise be funded by an S-VAT, then they would be 
funded by the I-VAT to take advantage of border adjustability.

I-VAT forces everyone, from the working poor to the beneficiaries of 
inherited wealth, to pay taxes and share in the cost of government. As 
part of enactment, gross wages will be reduced to take into account the 
shift to S-VAT and I-VAT, however net income will be increased by the 
same percentage as the I-VAT. Inherited assets will be taxed under A-
VAT when sold. Any inherited cash, or funds borrowed against the value 
of shares, will face the I-VAT when sold or the A-VAT if invested.

I-VAT will fund domestic discretionary spending, equal dollar employer 
OASI contributions, and non-nuclear, non-deployed military spending, 
possibly on a regional basis. Regional I-VAT would both require a 
constitutional amendment to change the requirement that all excises be 
national and to discourage unnecessary spending, especially when 
allocated for electoral reasons rather than program needs. The latter 
could also be funded by the asset VAT (decreasing the rate by from 
19.25% to 13%).

Carbon Added Tax (C-AT). A Carbon tax with receipt visibility, which 
allows comparison shopping based on carbon content, even if it means a 
more expensive item with lower carbon is purchased. C-AT would also 
replace fuel taxes. It will fund transportation costs, including mass 
transit, and research into alternative fuels. This tax would not be 
border adjustable unless it is in other nations, however in this case 
the imposition of this tax at the border will be noted, with the U.S. 
tax applied to the overseas base.

Attachment Three--Tax Administration, Treasury Budget, February 12, 
                    2020

Shifting to a single system for all business taxation, particularly 
enacting invoice value-added taxes to collect revenue and employer-
based subtraction value-added taxes to distribute benefits to workers 
will end the need for filing for most, if not all, households. Any 
remaining high salary surtax would be free of any deductions and 
credits and could as easily be collected by enacting higher tiers to a 
subtraction VAT.

Subtraction VAT collection will closely duplicate the collection of 
payroll and income taxes--as well as employment taxes--but without 
households having to file an annual reconciliation except to verify the 
number of dependents receiving benefits.

Tax reform will simplify tax administration on all levels. Firms will 
submit electronic receipts for I-VAT and C-VAT credit, leaving a 
compliance trail. S-VAT payments to providers, wages and child credits 
to verify that what is paid and what is claimed match and that children 
are not double credited from separate employers.

A-VAT transactions are recorded by brokers, employers for option 
exercise and closing agents for real property. With ADP, reporting 
burdens are equal to those in any VAT system for I-VAT and A-VAT and 
current payroll and income tax reporting by employers.

Employees with children will annually verify information provided by 
employers and IRS, responding by a postcard if reports do not match, 
triggering collection actions. The cliche will thus be made real.

High-salary employees who use corporations to reduce salary surtax and 
pay I-VAT and S-VAT for personal staff. Distributions from such 
corporations to owners are considered salary, not dividends.

Transaction based A-VAT payments end the complexity and tax avoidance 
experienced with income tax collection. Tax units with income under 
$84,000 or only one employer need not file high salary surtax returns. 
Separate gift and inheritance tax returns will no longer be required.

State governments will collect federal and state I-VAT, C-VAT, S-VAT 
payments, audit collection systems, real property A-VAT and conduct 
enforcement actions. IRS collects individual payroll and salary surtax 
payments, performs electronic data matching and receive payments and 
ADP data from states. SEC collects A-VAT receipts.

I-VAT gives all citizens the responsibility to fund the government. C-
VAT invoices encourage lower carbon consumption, mass transit, research 
and infrastructure development. A-VAT taxation will slow market 
volatility and encourage employee ownership, while preserving family 
businesses and farms. Very little IRS Administration will be required 
once reform is fully implemented. All IRS employees could fit in a 
bathtub with room for Grover Norquist.
