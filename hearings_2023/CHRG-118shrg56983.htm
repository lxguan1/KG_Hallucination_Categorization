                                       U.S. Senate,
                               Committee on Indian Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:30 p.m. in room 
628, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Brian Schatz, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN SCHATZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII

    The Chairman. Good afternoon. I call this oversight hearing 
to order.
    Last month, we heard directly from tribal leaders and 
Native health experts on the front lines of the fentanyl crisis 
that is devastating Native communities across the Country. We 
learned about the unique factors that complicate fentanyl 
response in Native communities, such as checkerboard criminal 
jurisdiction, minimal data, structural barriers to resources 
for law enforcement, prevention, intervention, staffing, and 
housing.
    Yet, Native communities are responding to the crisis with 
strength and determination. Promising culturally based 
practices and tribally run dedicated treatment programs and 
recovery facilities for fentanyl misuse are on the rise and 
seeing great success.
    Our hearing last month was important not just for our work 
on this Committee and in Congress, but also for the Executive 
Branch to better understand the situation on the ground and 
inform our next steps. That is why today's hearing with our 
Federal panel is an important follow-up. We will examine the 
adequacy of Federal resources to address the fentanyl crisis in 
Native communities from public safety to treatment and 
prevention.
    The United States must live up to its trust and treaty 
responsibilities to promote the health and well-being of 
American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. That 
responsibility includes responding to modern threats, including 
fentanyl.
    I am looking forward to hearing about how the 
Administration's national strategy to combat fentanyl actively 
considers Native needs, identifies gaps in resources and 
interagency coordination, and supports Native-led solutions.
    Before I turn to the Vice Chair for her opening statement, 
I would like to thank all of our witnesses for joining us for 
this important discussion.
    Vice Chair Murkowski?

               STATEMENT OF HON. LISA MURKOWSKI, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you 
for convening this hearing, the second in a series on the 
fentanyl crisis. As you detailed, at our November hearing we 
were able to hear from Native leaders and health experts on the 
challenges they are facing as they work to end addiction and 
increase public safety efforts to stop the trafficking of these 
illicit synthetic opioids.
    We heard some pretty devastating statistics. Native people 
have the highest overdose death rates from synthetic opioids 
when you compare them to other racial and ethnic groups. In 
Alaska alone, Alaska Native opioid overdose deaths increased by 
383 percent from 2018 to just last year.
    This increase in abuse, misuse, and overdoses led the AFN, 
Alaska Federation of Natives, to adopt a resolution last year 
calling for support and increased resources to combat this 
epidemic that we are seeing in far too many of our Alaska 
Native communities. We see calls to actions like this all 
across the Country. The 2023 National Tribal Opioid Summit 
recently released a report that includes some recommendations I 
hope we can get into today.
    As these illegal drugs continue to make their way into our 
Country, we will continue to see spikes in overdoses and 
deaths. Drug traffickers are targeting our Native communities. 
I think that is what is particularly hurtful and harmful, is to 
know that they are specifically targeting our Native 
communities. They know that these communities are more rural, 
they know they are more isolated. They know there is less law 
enforcement presence, and they also know that they can make 
more money off our Native people.
    Last month, I noted that a drug trafficking ring targeted 
hubs as well as smaller villages in Alaska. Some of these 
communities were relatively big in size, Sitka, Dillingham, 
Ketchikan, but also small villages, Tyonek, Good News Bay, New 
Stuyahok, Savoonga, Togiak. These are communities where you 
have 500 people. Organized, multi-State drug traffickers are 
seeing an incentive to get to Native communities that struggle 
with a lack of law enforcement. It is unacceptable and more 
must be done in response.
    With the Federal panel here, we need to better understand 
what actions are being taken at the agencies when it comes to 
investigations, to seizures, and providing resources. We need 
to know how Congress can better support our Federal agencies 
and Native communities to work together to address this crisis.
    Thank you all for being here today. And thank you, Chairman 
Schatz, for the opportunity to continue this important 
discussion.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Vice Chair Murkowski.
    Senator Cantwell, for an opening statement.

               STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Chairman Schatz. And thank you 
and Vice Chair Murkowski for your important work on holding 
this second fentanyl crisis hearing in Indian Country. Thank 
you for your comments. I think Senator Murkowski's comments 
illuminated very well the challenge that we face in dealing 
with the fentanyl problem specifically in Indian Country.
    Last month, we heard directly from tribal leaders about 
fentanyl and the need to help protect members from this deadly 
drug. Today we will learn from the Administration what they are 
doing to help in the crisis. I am glad that United States 
Attorney Waldref of the Eastern District of Washington is here. 
Thank you so much for being here. You can talk directly about 
how it is harming communities in the eastern part of our State.
    Earlier this year, Federal, State, local and tribal law 
enforcement made huge seizures of drugs in eastern Washington. 
They prevented more than 100 pounds of drugs, 161,000 fentanyl-
laced pills, from reaching the Colville and Yakima tribal 
communities. Lat week, Kalispell Tribe law enforcement officers 
seized another 18,000 fentanyl-laced pills in Airway Heights, 
just outside Spokane, Washington.
    Make no mistake about it: the fentanyl crisis is a flood of 
poison entering Indian Country and communities. It is not a 
crisis that our tribes can face alone.
    We have heard about tribal leaders and their law 
enforcement agencies and how they are chronically understaffed 
and under resourced. In eastern Washington, just a handful of 
officers are responsible for patrolling thousands of square 
miles of tribal land. They can't shoulder that burden alone.
    Another persistent issue is the lack of strong and 
consistent data on fentanyl overdoses across Indian Country. We 
need to do a good job of understanding that problem. This poses 
a huge hurdle for effectively directing Federal resources, not 
to mention law enforcement and health care professionals, if we 
don't know how to accurately describe the crisis.
    As tribal communities everywhere confront this crisis, we 
know that we need more support. Earlier this week, the National 
Portland Area Indian Health Board released its Federal policy 
recommendations from the National Tribal Opioid Summit held in 
August. I know that NCAI will look forward to reviewing those 
issues.
    The summit, I thought, was a very good cross section of 
people throughout the United States who were talking about how 
this was affecting their particular region. But we need more 
opportunities to do health and wellness, we need more 
partnership from the Federal Government on law enforcement, and 
we need the tools to stop this product from arriving in our 
Country.
    I want to applaud our colleagues who went to China and 
urged the Chinese government to stop production of the 
precursors that are used. I think we have made some progress on 
that. I know that the President met at a summit in San 
Francisco and had a similar commitment by the Chinese leader.
    I hope that our colleagues, whoever is stopping or trying 
to stop the Senate provisions of the NDAA, the Fend Off 
Fentanyl Act, which is literally cracking down on the 
distribution of drugs by cracking down on the money sources, I 
know my colleague from Nevada knows this very well, somehow, 
somebody is trying to stop us from getting this over the goal 
line. I hope they will just quit. I hope they will understand 
that this is a tool that we need to get passed, we need to 
crack down on these rings, we need to crack down on the money. 
Those pills that were just held up, this is one package of one 
delivery happening in our communities everywhere.
    So the seizure of this product could be greatly enhanced by 
stopping the trafficking. We need to pass the Fend Off Fentanyl 
Act. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Are there any other opening statements? If not, we will 
turn to our witnesses. I will introduce all the witnesses, then 
we will begin the testimony.
    First, we have Adam W. Cohen, Deputy Director of the White 
House Office of National Drug Control Policy. We also are 
pleased to have the Honorable Roselyn Tso, the Director of IHS 
at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
    We are also pleased to welcome the Honorable Vanessa 
Waldref, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of 
Washington State in the U.S. Department of Justice. And Mr. 
Glen Melville, Bureau Deputy Director, Bureau of Indian Affairs 
Office of Justice Services at the United States Department of 
Interior.
    I will remind you that your full testimony will be made 
part of the record. Please take no longer than five minutes, 
and no one's feelings will be hurt if you take even less than 
that.
    With that, Mr. Cohen, please proceed with your testimony.

STATEMENT OF ADAM W. COHEN, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE OFFICE 
                OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY

    Mr. Cohen. Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, 
members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today.
    The late Senator Daniel Akaka, who as you know was the 
first Native Hawaiian to serve in the Senate and chair this 
Committee, believed strongly that the United States must 
fulfill its responsibility to indigenous peoples. I want to be 
clear that this Administration shares this belief.
    Since day one, the Administration has made record 
investments to honor the Federal Government's commitment to 
tribal nations and native communities. Specific to drug policy, 
this includes dedicating $941 million over the past three years 
at a time of unprecedented challenges.
    Today, we are in the midst of the most dynamic and deadly 
drug environment we have ever seen. There were more than 
110,000 overdose deaths in the United States in 2022, with 
three-quarters involving illicit fentanyl. That is 300 per day; 
more than 12 per hour. In the five minutes that I will be 
speaking with you, we will lose another life to this crisis.
    And there is a tragic disparity. Overdose deaths continue 
to climb among Native communities, even as the numbers of 
overdose deaths nationally levels off.
    Immediately prior to accepting President Biden's 
appointment to this position some 10 weeks ago, I served for 25 
years with the Department of Justice as a career prosecutor, 
serving under six presidents and ten attorneys general of both 
parties. In this role, I took part in the Department's response 
to drug threats spanning cocaine, heroin, and now fentanyl. I 
have also had a front row seat to the opioid epidemic, serving 
as a coordinator of our Federal law enforcement response.
    And now, as one of the leaders working to synchronize all 
U.S. drug policy across both public health and public safety, I 
am here to say that President Biden and his Administration are 
committed to doing everything in our power to beat this crisis. 
This absolutely includes ensuring American Indian, Alaska 
Native, and Native Hawaiian communities have the public health 
and public safety tools that they need to build stronger and 
more resilient communities.
    President Biden's National Drug Control Strategy, which 
ONDCP leads and implements, is targeted at two key drivers of 
this crisis: untreated addiction and the drug trafficking 
profits that fuel it. Under the strategy and with the 
bipartisan support of Congress, the Administration has taken 
several historic actions to improve access to treatment and 
counter the supply of fentanyl. These actions have led to 
overdose deaths leveling off in 2022 and 2023, after sharp 
increases the previous three years.
    The National Drug Control Strategy was developed in 
consultation with more than 2,000 stakeholders, including 
tribal communities. In fact, ONDCP has engaged with tribal 
leaders since the beginning of this Administration, and has 
seen up close the toll that this crisis is taking on Native 
communities.
    Most recently, Dr. Gupta, the Director of ONDCP, 
participated in the National Tribal Opioid Summit and visited 
the Tulalip Indian Reservation and the Tohono O'odham where 
families shared with him stories of their loved ones lost, and 
leaders spoke of the challenges that they face in reversing 
overdoses, treating addiction, and stopping cartels that try to 
take advantage of reservations as trafficking routes.
    ONDCP's key grant programs, including our High Intensity 
Drug Trafficking Areas program, or HIDTA, and the Drug Free 
Communities Support Program, or DFC, work closely with the 
Native communities to disrupt drug trafficking and prevent 
youth substance use before it begins.
    This summer, ONDCP met with the Arizona HIDTA and the 
Native American Target Investigation of Violent Enterprises, or 
NATIVE Task Force, who are working to combat drug trafficking 
along the shared border between the Tohono O'odham Nation and 
Mexico. Dr. Gupta rode along with the Shadow Wolves, a Native 
American investigative unit assigned to Homeland Security 
investigations, who this year alone have helped to seize more 
than 700,000 fentanyl pills before they could harm Americans.
    It is clear that tribal nations and Native communities are 
committed to beating this crisis. And this Administration is 
committed to helping them. We urge Congress to pass President 
Biden's request for $15 billion to support health equity, 
public safety and social determinants of health in Native 
communities. And we are calling on Congress to pass the 
President's supplemental funding request, which will disrupt 
fentanyl trafficking and strengthen our public health response, 
with $250 million going to tribes and tribal organizations.
    We are dealing with an historic and unprecedented crisis, 
and it requires historic and unprecedented resources to match 
the scale. Your leadership demonstrates that the opioid crisis 
is not a partisan issue. It is an issue that affects every 
corner of every community. And that is why beating this crisis 
is a key pillar of the President's bipartisan unity agenda. It 
demands the very best from all of us.
    Dr. Gupta and I will continue to speak up about this issue, 
including at tomorrow's White House Tribal Nations Summit. We 
look forward to working with you to help Native communities 
thrive.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Cohen follows:]

   Prepared Statement of Adam W. Cohen, Deputy Director, White House 
                 Office of National Drug Control Policy
    Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and distinguished Members 
of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today 
regarding the growing problem of illicit fentanyl in Native 
communities, as well as the Biden-Harris Administration's vital work to 
save lives by strengthening public health and public safety in order to 
reduce overdoses. I am honored to join you today, on behalf of the 
Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), to discuss lasting 
solutions to the opioid and overdose epidemic, which has devastated so 
many families across Tribal Nations and Native communities.
    Every five minutes around the clock, someone in the United States 
dies from a drug overdose or poisoning. The majority of these deaths 
are caused by illicit synthetic drugs, such as clandestinely 
manufactured fentanyl and methamphetamine, which are often used in 
combination with each other or other drugs like cocaine and the 
emerging threat illicit xylazine. \1\ The Biden-Harris Administration 
has focused its efforts on tackling this changing and dynamic drug 
supply, while addressing longstanding structural factors that have 
limited access to life-saving public health interventions. We must do 
everything in our power to ensure people get the support they need to 
beat this epidemic, build strong, resilient communities, and thrive--
all while continuing to ensure the federal government honors its 
commitment to Tribal Nations and Native communities.

    While the most recent provisional data shows that our efforts have 
helped lead to overdose deaths levelling off nationally throughout 2022 
and 2023, much work remains to be done. \2\ This is particularly and 
tragically true among American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native 
Hawaiian communities, where overdose deaths have climbed in recent 
years even as the national rate has slowed.

    The reasons for this differential impact are varied and rooted in 
history, and they manifest themselves in our data. In addition to 
rising overdose deaths, we know that American Indian and Alaska Native 
persons, for example, experienced the second highest nonfatal opioid 
overdose rate last year, yet had the lowest number of administrations 
of naloxone per overdose. \3\ We also know that American Indian and 
Alaska Native persons in the United States were nearly two times more 
likely to suffer from drug use disorder compared to their White 
counterparts in 2022. \4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It is one thing to understand this data, but it is far more 
important to experience it and understand it in direct interaction with 
these communities. At ONDCP, we have heard from families and Native 
communities who have lost loved ones to an overdose. We have listened 
to Tribal government officials and substance use treatment providers 
describe the strengths and challenges they face in their communities, 
including increasing access to naloxone and the need for greater 
information sharing with law enforcement. The toll of the opioid 
epidemic on their families and communities is significant.
    These people, their families, and their communities, expect this 
Administration to stay in their corner--and we will.
    That is why ending the opioid epidemic in and outside of Tribal 
communities is a key pillar of the Biden-Harris Administration's Unity 
Agenda. The President has challenged his entire Administration to 
implement the National Drug Control Strategy (Strategy), which ONDCP 
developed in consultation with more than 2,000 leaders and stakeholders 
including advocates representing public safety, public health, 
community groups, local governments, and Tribal communities. \5\ Our 
overarching goal is to reduce the number of drug overdose deaths, put 
high-quality public health services within reach for people with 
substance use disorder, and strengthen public safety by disrupting the 
drug production and trafficking pipeline that profits by harming our 
loved ones.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Today, I want to emphatically state that the Biden-Harris 
Administration is delivering on unprecedented whole-of-government 
actions that are saving lives, and continuing to take urgent and 
necessary action. We have made naloxone more widely available, and are 
working to make it far more accessible and affordable. We have removed 
historic barriers to treatment, and are working to make it available to 
everyone who is ready for it. We have dedicated historic funding to law 
enforcement, and are further improving policies that target drug 
traffickers and disrupt their schemes as well as the profits that fuel 
the illicit drug trade.
    While the Biden-Harris Administration is dedicating specific law 
enforcement and public health resources to this work--in partnership 
with Tribal communities--we must remember that this problem does not 
start at our borders and it will not end at our borders.
    Through commercial disruption, we are targeting not only the 
illicit finished drugs and those who sell them, but also raw materials 
like precursor chemicals and the machinery used in production of 
illicit pills, the commercial shipping that moves these items around 
the world, and the flow of financial benefits and operating capital to 
individuals and groups directly and indirectly involved in the illicit 
drug industry.
    Targeting these critical elements will allow us to remove the gaps 
illicit fentanyl producers and traffickers currently exploit, disrupt 
their production and supply chains, and reduce the availability of 
these dangerous substances in our communities. Disrupting global 
illicit drug trafficking and constraining transnational organized crime 
is a key public safety priority of this Administration.
Supporting Law Enforcement
    Much of my career has focused on bringing together state, local, 
Tribal, and federal law enforcement to synchronize and coordinate 
efforts to keep our communities safe from criminal actors, 
sophisticated transnational organized crime networks, and international 
drug cartels trafficking cocaine, methamphetamine, and fentanyl into 
the United States. Disrupting the flow of drugs into our communities is 
important--not only to keep these substances from harming people and 
denying drug traffickers illicit proceeds, but it is critical to allow 
our historic investments in public health to be effective. That is why 
this Administration has invested significant amounts of funding for law 
enforcement efforts to target and dismantle illicit trafficking 
networks, deploy the latest drug detection technology, and enable 
historic seizures of illicit fentanyl along the southwest border.
    Under President Biden's leadership, there are now a record number 
of personnel working to secure the border. In just the last year, 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized 547,000 pounds of illicit 
drugs, including nearly 28,000 pounds of fentanyl, primarily at ports 
of entry on our border. \6\ These numbers speak not only to the 
magnitude of the threat, but also to the corresponding strength of our 
strategic response and the incredible work of courageous, committed, 
and resilient CBP officials who keep our borders secure and our 
communities safe.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As part of President Biden's Invest in America agenda, we are 
expanding the use of high-tech non-intrusive inspection (NII) systems 
to detect trafficking at the border. These systems, which can check 
vehicles faster than agents doing physical searches, are an integral 
part of a layered enforcement strategy to secure the border. The 
Administration's Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 national security supplemental 
request to Congress provides more than $1.2 billion in counterdrug 
funding, including $849 million for CBP to advance its deployment of 
NII systems at the southwest border. These technology advancements will 
help CBP increase its inspection capacity from what has historically 
been around 1 percent of passenger vehicles and about 15 to 17 percent 
of cargo vehicles, to 40 percent of passenger vehicles and 70 percent 
of cargo vehicles. \7\ But these investments are just the start; the 
goal is to ensure that every vehicle that needs it is inspected in a 
comprehensive manner. This will go a long way to keeping illicit drugs 
out of our country, including Tribal communities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Collaboration across all levels of government and with Tribal 
partners is essential to strengthening our domestic response to drug 
trafficking. Prior to my current appointment, I served as the Director 
of the Executive Office for the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task 
Forces at the Department of Justice, the largest law enforcement task 
force in the United States. I cannot overemphasize the necessity of 
information and intelligence sharing in a dynamic drug threat 
environment. Effectively countering sophisticated drug trafficking 
organizations requires an approach combining the expertise, 
perspectives, and authorities of federal, state, local, Tribal, and 
territorial agencies, as well as foreign partners. That is why this 
Administration is building the tools, relationships, and capacity to 
address a constantly evolving set of criminal networks that adapt their 
methods, change their tactics and techniques, and employ new 
technologies to avoid detection, interdiction, arrest, and prosecution.
    The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program is one of 
our most impactful investments; these multi-jurisdictional task forces 
bring together the resources, expertise, and authorities of federal, 
state, local, Tribal, and territorial agencies to target drug 
traffickers and their networks, and stop them from distributing illicit 
drugs into our communities. These task forces mitigate jurisdictional 
challenges for law enforcement, such as investigations on Tribal lands 
and Tribal Trust lands that straddle international borders with Mexico 
and Canada, where criminal organizations exploit the gaps and seams 
between jurisdictions to ply their trade. Earlier this year, we 
designated nine new HIDTA counties that have been impacted severely by 
drug trafficking and overdoses. We are working to get them the critical 
resources and support they need to enhance law enforcement 
collaboration. \8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Fourteen regional HIDTAs across the country work directly with 
Tribal law enforcement and the Bureau of Indian Affairs to disrupt the 
market for illicit drugs. Last year, these HIDTA Tribal task forces 
seized over $414 million in illicit drugs, cash, and other assets from 
traffickers. In total, all HIDTAs seized an estimated $22 billion in 
illicit drugs and cash in 2022--a return on investment of $82.91 for 
every $1 budgeted for the program. \9\ President Biden's FY 2024 budget 
calls for $290.2 million in funding for the HIDTA Program, which is 
managed by ONDCP. \10\ Funding this program is a successful, time-
tested, and evidence-based way for Congress to help us reduce the 
illicit drug supply, prevent overdoses and poisonings, save lives, and 
make our communities safer.

    The Arizona HIDTA Native American Targeted Investigation of Violent 
Enterprises (NATIVE) task force, for example, works to reduce, 
dismantle, and disrupt drug trafficking organizations that utilize the 
shared border between the Tohono O'odham Nation and Mexico. \11\ The 
Shadow Wolves, a Native American investigation unit assigned to 
Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) on the Tohono O'odham Nation, 
also work to disrupt all forms of transnational organized crime, 
including trafficking and smuggling of methamphetamine, illicit 
fentanyl, humans, firearms, and bulk cash.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ The NATIVE task force is led by the Tohono O'odham Police 
Department and consists of federal representatives from Homeland 
Security Investigations, U.S. Border Patrol, Bureau of Indian Affairs, 
Bureau of Land Management, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, and 
the Drug Enforcement Administration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ONDCP's Director, Dr. Rahul Gupta, traveled to Arizona in June to 
witness and learn firsthand the detail-oriented tracking work the 
Shadow Wolves perform on their unique terrain to combat smuggling and 
trafficking. While there, Dr. Gupta spoke with Tribal leadership and 
representatives from Tohono O'odham Healthcare about substance use 
disorder in the community as well as opportunities to increase 
prevention efforts and support services through telehealth and other 
behavioral health measures. Partnerships like these are critical to 
protecting both public health and safety.
Public Safety and Public Health Partnerships
    The HIDTA program also partners with the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) on the Overdose Response Strategy (ORS), 
which is designed to help communities reduce fatal and nonfatal drug 
overdoses by connecting public health and public safety agencies, 
sharing information, and supporting evidence-based interventions. HIDTA 
ORS teams are engaged with Tribes and Native communities in states like 
Alaska, Montana, Washington, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Oklahoma, 
to name a few.
    For example, the Montana ORS team has been collaborating with five 
Tribal law enforcement agencies, two Tribal public health agencies, 
three federal law enforcement entities with jurisdiction on Tribal 
lands in Montana, and the Rocky Mountain Tribal Leaders Council--Tribal 
Epidemiology Center to assist with collaboration efforts, data sharing, 
and intelligence sharing between local, state, Tribal, and federal 
agencies to respond effectively to the growing drug overdose problem in 
Montana.
    The ORS team's focus is to utilize overdose mapping software known 
as ODMAP to set up coordinated response plans to overdoses occurring 
throughout Montana--especially on the reservations. ODMAP provides near 
real-time suspected overdose data to support public safety and public 
health efforts to mobilize an immediate response to a sudden increase 
or spike in overdose events. This will include collaboration with over 
110 local, state, Tribal, and federal public health and public safety 
agencies and several hospitals across Montana to expand ODMAP coverage, 
access, and use for each reservation.
    Similarly, the HIDTA ORS team in Wyoming has been working with the 
Wind River Indian Reservation and the Eastern Shoshone Tribal Health 
Team to better understand the need for overdose services, improve 
access to naloxone, and expand ODMAP access to inform Tribal leadership 
of the epidemic's impact within the community. I can tell you today 
that ONDCP is committed to increasing outreach to Tribes through our 
regional HIDTAs and the ORS teams across the United States.
Our Strong Public Health Response
    Our public safety efforts must be linked with our public health 
efforts to reduce demand for and use of these substances. Untreated 
addiction, and the drug trafficking profits that fuel it, are two sides 
of the same coin. Traffickers are not going to import products no one 
wants, and individuals cannot overdose on drugs that are not available 
for them to purchase. The simple truth is that if it is easier to get 
drugs than it is to get treatment, we will never reduce overdose 
deaths.
    The Biden-Harris Administration has been diligently tackling the 
structural factors that hamper our ability to decrease overdose deaths. 
We have committed billions of dollars, more than half of our federal 
drug control budget, to public health measures to prevent our youth 
from falling into the cycle of drug use and addiction, reduce the harms 
caused by these drugs and save lives, extend treatment services to 
everyone who needs them, and make our communities and workplaces 
recovery-ready.
    Much of this work is being done in partnership with Congress, and I 
want to thank the Members of this Committee and the Congress at large 
for your support of numerous pieces of legislation. The bipartisan 
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, in particular, included key 
provisions to help lower barriers to treatment and to deliver necessary 
tools and resources to our communities to address the overdose crisis, 
such as the Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act and the Medication 
Access and Training Expansion Act.
    Thanks to these provisions, prescribers can treat their patients 
who have opioid use disorder with buprenorphine, a medication proven to 
help people achieve recovery, without obtaining additional federal 
licensing. This drastically boosted the number of providers eligible to 
prescribe buprenorphine from roughly 130,000 before December 2022 to 
1.9 million today, making treatment far more accessible.
    Further, the Administration announced $55 million in funding last 
year for the Tribal Opioid Response grant program, which seeks to 
address the opioid epidemic in Tribal communities by increasing access 
to medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder and supporting 
prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery services. To date, 
the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has 
awarded 398 Tribal grantees, totaling $227 million in funds, as part of 
this grant program.
    In addition to the commitments made to Tribal Nations and Native 
communities in his FY 2024 budget request, President Biden has also 
requested $1.55 billion in domestic supplemental funding to expand 
essential life-saving services provided through the State Opioid 
Response grant program. This grant program has long been a core 
component of our response to the opioid epidemic and has provided 
treatment services to over 1.2 million people and helped reverse more 
than 500,000 overdoses.
    This supplemental funding is urgently needed to help Tribal 
communities address the severe impacts of the overdose and opioid 
epidemic. Of this amount, approximately $250 million would be 
transferred to the Indian Health Service for prevention, treatment, 
recovery support services, and harm reduction interventions. This is a 
historic set-aside of emergency opioid funding for Tribes and Tribal 
organizations.
    Dr. Gupta had the honor of participating in the inaugural National 
Tribal Opioid Summit hosted by the Northwest Portland Area Indian 
Health Board and the National Indian Health Board earlier this year. 
Several participants at the Summit discussed challenges that many 
Tribal Nations face in accessing federal resources via the cumbersome 
processes associated with grants.gov. The White House has been 
developing an online clearinghouse of federal funding opportunities 
available to Tribes as a direct response to these concerns. I am proud 
to share that ONDCP resources and funding opportunities will be 
included in this clearinghouse.
    The Administration is also continuing to bring down other barriers 
to care, including: working to finalize a rule to make permanent COVID-
era policies that allow take home of methadone and the use of 
telehealth for buprenorphine treatment initiated by an opioid treatment 
program; creating a new opportunity for states to increase care for 
individuals in the period immediately prior to their release to help 
them succeed and thrive during reentry; and expanding access to life-
saving harm reduction services like overdose reversal medications.
Mobilizing Communities to Prevent Youth Substance Use
    We have also awarded nearly $100 million in grants over the past 
year as part of the Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Support Program, which 
provides funding to more than 750 community coalitions across the 
country working to prevent youth substance use. \12\ DFC coalitions 
constitute a critical part of our drug prevention infrastructure--they 
are a catalyst for building capacity at the local level and engaging 
youth with messaging and resources tailored to their needs and the 
challenges they face. ONDCP funds and directs the DFC program with 
critical support from the CDC.

CONGRESSIONAL-BUDGET-SUBMISSION-FINAL.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Currently, 70 DFC-funded coalitions are located in, or serving, a 
federally recognized Tribal area, and approximately $8.75 million goes 
to fund these coalitions. Tribal representation in the DFC program has 
grown from 1.9 percent in 2006 to 10.2 percent in 2023-more than a 
five-fold increase. About 17 percent of all DFC coalitions tailor their 
information and prevention efforts to focus on the needs of Tribal 
groups, including American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native 
Hawaiians.
    For example, the Healing Our People and Environment Coalition works 
to prevent and reduce substance use among middle school youth in Sitka, 
Alaska, with an emphasis on working with Indigenous and LGBTQIA+ youth. 
And, the Cherokee Nation Coalition Action Network in Tahlequah, 
Oklahoma also mobilizes Tribal and community-based agencies and 
resources to address issues associated with youth substance use on the 
Cherokee Nation Reservation. By empowering youth to share their own 
experiences and be a part of solution-focused planning through youth 
coalition meetings, they are creating a generation of advocates who 
share these skills and messages with their home communities. The Navajo 
Youth Builders Coalition in Fort Defiance, New Mexico is another 
example of a DFC coalition engaging the local community in developing a 
culturally grounded youth prevention curriculum and encouraging active 
participation of community members, parents, and young people in the 
process.
    ONDCP will continue to partner with Tribal and Native communities, 
and we are planning to offer trainings for Tribes on how to meet the 
DFC program's eligibility requirements in advance of the next DFC 
Notice of Funding Opportunity announcement.
Conclusion
    Every life saved means one less grieving family and community. 
There is hope, there is progress, and there is an unwavering commitment 
from the Biden-Harris Administration to help Native communities 
overcome the opioid epidemic. We have much work ahead of us, and your 
partnership will be as critical in the months ahead as it has been thus 
far.
    On behalf of Dr. Gupta and the hardworking team of the Office of 
National Drug Control Policy, I would like to thank the Committee and 
your Congressional colleagues for your foresight and leadership on this 
incredibly difficult issue. Ending the opioid and overdose crisis 
demands the best efforts of us all: Tribal Nations; federal and state 
policy makers; national and regional Tribal organizations; private-
sector partners and stakeholders; and the Congress, which has time and 
again demonstrated a strong spirit of bipartisanship on this issue.
    The Office of National Drug Control Policy looks forward to 
continuing its work with this Committee, the Congress, and our other 
partners to disrupt the production and trafficking of these dangerous 
drugs, prevent and reduce drug overdoses and poisonings, save lives, 
and protect Tribal Nations and Native communities.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much. Ms. Tso, please proceed.

STATEMENT OF HON. ROSELYN TSO, DIRECTOR, INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE, 
          U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

    Ms. Tso. Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony 
on the IHS efforts to combat and treat the opioid crisis, 
particularly synthetic opioids, like illicit manufactured 
fentanyl in our tribal communities.
    As the Committee knows, IHS is a comprehensive, direct care 
delivery provider, and thus we have been on the front lines of 
this growing crisis. We recognize the profound toll that the 
opioid epidemic has taken on our American Indians and Alaska 
Native people. We are not only confronting medical challenges, 
but also standing up against the threat to our tribal 
communities.
    Shortly after this hearing, I will join Secretary Becerra 
and other HHS principals at the Tribal Nations Summit breakout 
to dialogue between HHS and tribal leaders. The Biden 
Administration is addressing the devastating impacts of the 
opioid epidemic on tribal lands by dedicating millions of 
dollars to strengthen prevention, harm reduction, treatment and 
recovery support services.
    In October, the President requested $1.6 billion in 
supplemental funding for SAMHSA's State Opioid Response 
program. Of this, $250 million will be transferred to Indian 
Health Service to go to Indian Country to meet the unmet needs 
of the fentanyl and poly-substance misuse in Indian Country. 
This request underscores the emergent nature of this crisis and 
the work that we still have to do to strengthen our primary 
prevention efforts and increase access to the full continuum of 
care and services for individuals with substance use disorders 
and their families.
    We at IHS understand the cost of this converging overdose 
emergency, the pandemic recovery, continued behavioral health 
crisis, and the strain on our health care system. We also 
recognize the overdose mortality data is rising, and that 
American Indians and Alaska Native overdose mortality rates 
increased by 39 percent between 2019 and 2020. These mortality 
rates were the highest compared to any other racial or ethnic 
group.
    The impact of the fentanyl crisis is personal. In August, I 
partnered with many regional, State, and tribal partners at the 
first National Opioid Summit hosted by the Northwest Portland 
Area Indian Health Board to address the fentanyl crisis in 
tribal communities. Collectively, we worked to underscore that 
our approach should be centered on collaboration and support 
tribal practices that are already in place and are working. And 
we should emphasize community approaches that strengthen 
resiliency.
    Our IHS leadership team is reminded of the importance of 
centering ourselves in compassionate care models and ensuring 
policy decisions are guided by the lessons of lived 
experiences. We have heard from our tribes that there is a lack 
of resources for detoxification services for addiction. 
Detoxification for opioids is challenging and medically 
complex. It is crucial to have specific funding allocated to 
support detoxification and recovery service. This is consistent 
with the tribal message this Committee heard last month.
    I know that my entire testimony is in place. Therefore, in 
closing, I and my senior leadership and all of the Indian 
Health Service recognize the importance of working side by side 
with tribes and tribal leaders to develop comprehensive plans 
for addressing the opioid crisis in Indian Country. We also 
recognize that each community plan includes strategies that 
will work for each community.
    In September, I joined the Secretary of SAMHSA and other 
HHS colleagues at the Secretary's Tribal Advisory Meeting in 
South Dakota, to consult with tribes and discuss our work in 
Indian Country. Just last week, we continued this dialogue with 
tribal leaders.
    As IHS combats the opioid crisis, we will continue to work 
hand in hand with all of our HHS colleagues to maximize 
resources for Indian Country. We also have partnered with other 
Federal agencies beyond the Department, including the 
Department of the VA, Agriculture, and the departments and 
agencies of all the witnesses sitting next to me today.
    I value the ongoing support of the Federal partners and the 
critical work in tribal communities. Thank you for your 
commitment, and I welcome any additional opportunities to work 
together across the Government and with Congress to enhance 
programs and find solutions and resources to address the needs 
across Indian Country.
    I am happy to answer any questions the Committee may have.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Tso follows:]

    Prepared Statement of Hon. Roselyn Tso, Director, Indian Health 
         Service, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
    Good afternoon Chairman Schatz, Vice Chair Murkowski, and Members 
of the Committee. I am Roselyn Tso, Director of the Indian Health 
Service (IHS). Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on 
the IHS's efforts to combat and treat the opioid crisis--particularly 
synthetic opioids like illicitly manufactured fentanyl--in Native 
Communities. As a comprehensive direct care and delivery provider, the 
IHS has been on the frontlines of the growing crisis, recognizing the 
profound toll the opioid epidemic has taken on American Indian and 
Alaskan Native people. Together, we are not only confronting a medical 
challenge, but also standing against a threat to the very fabric of our 
communities. The Biden Administration is addressing the devastating 
impact of the opioid epidemic on Tribal lands by dedicating millions of 
dollars to strengthen prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and 
recovery support services. Close to 70 percent of overdose deaths in 
2022 involved fentanyl. In October of this year, the President 
requested $1.6 billion in supplemental funding for the Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Service Administration's (SAMHSA) State Opioid 
Response program to address the opioid, fentanyl, and polysubstance use 
crisis in America. Of this amount, $250 million or 16 percent, would be 
transferred to the IHS to address unmet needs regarding fentanyl and 
polysubstance misuse in Indian Country. This request underscores the 
emergent nature of this crisis, and the work we still need to do to 
strengthen our primary prevention efforts and increase access to the 
full continuum of care and services for individuals with substance use 
disorder (SUD) and their families. Ultimately, this is about saving 
lives.
    The IHS understands the cost of the converging overdose 
emergencies, pandemic recovery, continuing behavioral health crises, 
and the continued strain on our health care system and the communities 
we serve. We live these realities daily to support the IHS mission. We 
also recognize the overdose mortality data is rising and that American 
Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) overdose mortality rates increased 
by 39 percent between 2019 and 2020, with a sharp rise during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. These mortality rates were the highest compared to 
other racial and ethnic groups.
    We recognize that the impact of the fentanyl crisis is personal. In 
August 2023, IHS joined many regional, state, and Tribal partners in a 
National Tribal Opioid Summit hosted by the Northwest Portland Area 
Indian Health Board to address the fentanyl crisis in American Indian 
and Alaska Native communities. These partners used their time to 
underscore that approaches to this problem should center on 
collaboration, should support Tribal practices that are already in 
place and working, and should emphasize community approaches that 
strengthen resiliency. IHS senior leadership also listened to the 
stories of both trauma and healing from community members, and we were 
reminded of the importance of centering ourselves in compassionate care 
models and ensuring policy decisions are guided by these lessons of 
lived experience.
Working Across the Department and Government
    Just as we heard in the Portland Area, collaboration is a critical 
part of both the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the 
Indian Health Service's approach to combat the opioid crisis. IHS 
recognizes the importance of collaborating and consulting with Tribes 
to develop a comprehensive plan for addressing the opioid crisis in 
Indian Country. This September, I joined Assistant Secretary Miriam 
Delphin-Rittmon from SAMHSA at the Secretary's Tribal Advisory 
Committee in South Dakota to consult with Tribal leaders and discuss 
our work in Indian Country. Just last week, HHS principals, including 
the Assistant Secretary and myself met again with these Tribal leaders 
to continue our conversation. As IHS combats the opioid crisis, we work 
hand in hand with our HHS colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC), SAMHSA, Health Resources and Services 
Administration (HRSA), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Office of the 
Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH). We have also partnered with 
other federal agencies beyond the Department, including the Department 
of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department 
of Justice (DOJ), Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), and 
Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). IHS participates extensively on 
multiple interagency workgroups, providing valuable insight on the 
communities we serve. In particular, IHS has collaborated with SAMHSA 
on the Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse (IASA) Interdepartmental 
Coordinating Committee to build upon efforts in addressing alcohol and 
substance abuse in Indian Communities. IHS also works closely with the 
Office of Tribal Affairs and Policy to identify resources and programs 
from each agency that would be relevant to combatting alcohol and 
substance abuse in Tribal communities. This work and these partnerships 
demonstrate acutely that this problem is constantly evolving. It 
demands a whole of government approach.
    The IHS has strengthened and prioritized efforts to address the 
opioid crisis in Tribal communities through dedicated funding. In 
fiscal year (FY) 2023, the IHS provided over $266 million in funding to 
support alcohol and substance abuse programs, with the majority 
distributed directly to Tribally operated programs via compacts or 
contracts. These programs provide services at all stages of recovery 
from detoxification, behavioral counseling, outpatient and residential 
treatment, and long-term follow-up to prevent relapse. The IHS also 
administers several grant programs that impact prevention, treatment, 
and aftercare and support harm reduction services IHS developed the 
Community Opioid Intervention Pilot Project (COIPP) in coordination 
with SAMHSA colleagues. The IHS COIPP is a three-year pilot program and 
aligns with HHS' Overdose Strategy to respond to the national overdose 
crisis. The COIPP integrates culturally appropriate care as grantees 
create comprehensive support teams to strengthen and empower families 
confronting the opioid crisis. Developing and implementing a trauma-
informed approach, including addressing historical trauma, is necessary 
to comprehensively address the root causes of SUDs. As a direct result 
of COIPP funding, there are now over 800 staff and community members 
trained in trauma-informed care. Finally, the COIPP grantees continue 
to prioritize efforts to reduce unmet needs and opioid overdose deaths 
through education, partnerships, and increased access to treatment for 
persons with opioid use disorder.
    It is also important to note that SAMHSA provides Tribal Opioid 
Response (TOR) grants, a critical piece of the puzzle. These grants 
address the public health crisis of escalating opioid misuse and 
overdose in Tribal communities. In FY 2022, SAMHSA awarded $55 million 
in TOR grants. Since 2018, Tribes and Tribal organizations have 
provided TOR-funded treatment and recovery support services to 7,700 
clients. Tribes have also purchased and distributed 16,955 naloxone 
kits and 7,045 fentanyl testing strips and trained 3,357 community 
members on the use of lifesaving naloxone using TOR funding.
Federal Healthcare Operation Efforts
    In addition to dedicated funding to support overdose prevention 
efforts for IHS and Tribally operated programs as well as urban Indian 
organizations, the IHS provides administrative support and technical 
assistance for health care operations for direct service Tribes when 
requested. The IHS understands the importance of primary care and works 
through its Integrating Primary Care model to support integrated 
services. These efforts can be seen through the collaborative work 
championed by the IHS National Committee on Heroin, Opioids, and Pain 
Efforts.
    The IHS chartered a National Committee on Heroin, Opioids, and Pain 
Efforts (HOPE) in 2017 to promote appropriate and effective pain 
management, reduce overdose deaths, and improve access to culturally 
appropriate treatment. The HOPE Committee Treatment and Recovery work 
plan emphasizes two primary aims: (1) increasing access to treatment 
and (2) increasing patient engagement with recovery services. The 
strategy and work plan recognize the impact of health disparities 
resulting from historical structural determinants of health and align 
with critical concepts in the National Tribal Behavioral Health Agenda.
    The work plan addresses system-level barriers to support enhanced 
screening and patient assessment, early identification and diagnosis of 
SUD, improved care coordination, and access to high-quality integrated 
treatment services where needed. The IHS accomplishes these aims 
through policy, identification of clinical recommendations to support 
evidence-based care, and workforce development strategies. The IHS is 
proud of the work of its front-line staff throughout the pandemic--the 
same people managing the opioid overdose response also supported COVID-
19 pandemic response activities with limited additional resources.
Recent Accomplishments
    I would like to bring your attention to some recent achievements by 
IHS in its battle against fentanyl. The IHS Opioid Surveillance 
Dashboard was initially released in 2022 and was recently enhanced to 
include an additional 19 measures, which deliver additional data 
visualizations for safe opioid prescribing, naloxone saturation, co-
prescribing, and harm reduction activities. Prescription level drill-
down is enhanced to support targeted population health strategies. The 
Opioid Surveillance Dashboard data indicates initial positive increases 
in overall buprenorphine prescriptions, with an increase in the number 
of patients receiving buprenorphine and increases in naloxone 
prescribing. The dashboard also shows that prescribing of opioids in 
the IHS agency has been reduced from 261,813 opioid prescriptions in 
2014 to 63,340 opioid prescriptions in 2023, a decrease of 75 percent. 
This indicates that our training is working.
    In September 2023, the IHS released a new Essential Training on 
Pain and Addiction (ETPA) initial and refresher course. This on-demand, 
web-based course delivers evidence-based updates to clinical practice 
guidelines for pain management and includes a focus on patient-centered 
assessments and treatment planning. It also includes important content 
essential to support health equity for pain management conditions and 
opioid use disorders. This new training meets the Medication Access and 
Training Expansion Act requirements for new or renewing Drug 
Enforcement Administration licenses (provides 3 hours). The training is 
required for federal IHS prescribers, contractors (that spend 50 
percent or more of their clinical time under contract with the Federal 
Government), clinical residents, and trainees. The training is also 
available for Tribal and urban prescribers.
    The IHS has also developed an Educational Outreach Program pilot 
project. Three IHS sites were identified to create tailored peer-to-
peer interventions to enhance opioid stewardship activities, increase 
access to treatment services, and promote quality of care.
    The IHS is continuing to work to modernize its electronic health 
record to include integration of Prescription Drug Monitoring Program 
data. This software enhancement will streamline provider access to 
prescribing data and will inform clinical practice and care-planning 
decisions to increase the safety of opioid prescribing activities.
    The IHS collaborates with the NPAIHB to support the National 
Clinician Consultation Center Warmline access. This service offers on-
demand Clinician-To-Clinician support for IHS, Tribal and Urban 
Organization (I/T/U) providers managing substance use disorders, 
recommendations to support local policy and procedure development, and 
on-going site implementation. From July--September 2023, the call-
center experienced a 48 percent increase in I/T/U consultation requests 
(compared to the same period in 2022). Word is getting out that these 
resources are now here to help.
Care for specialized populations
    The IHS is also partnering with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) 
Corrections to develop a Memorandum of Agreement to improve access to 
care and care coordination for justice-involved populations. The 
collaboration aims to mitigate the impact of chronic diseases--
including substance use disorders and other behavioral health 
conditions, reduce morbidity related to secondary complications 
(including persons who inject drugs), reduce disease transmission rates 
and treat infectious diseases for justice involved populations. The IHS 
has also developed a provider guide and patient resources to support a 
comprehensive approach to supporting pregnant and parenting persons 
using substances.
Harm Reduction
    The IHS Pain and Addiction Care in the Emergency Department pilot 
project resulted in American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) 
Pain and Addiction Care in the Emergency Department accreditation of 
five direct-service Emergency Departments. The programs promote access 
to naloxone, evidence-based treatment, and enhanced care coordination. 
The second annual convening was hosted in September 2023 and included 
didactic presentations from the ACEP. There is no wrong door for 
treatment as this program aims to enhance screening for SUD and 
supports establishment of a treatment bridge and referral pathways.
    The Indian Health Service supports expanded harm reduction 
activities and continues to support community response. Health 
promotion and educational materials as well as direct naloxone 
distribution are key strategies. Recently, syringe service materials, 
drug checking strips, and, more broadly, infectious disease treatments 
have expanded as IHS works to address secondary complications of 
substance use.
Expanded access to naloxone to prevent unintentional opioid overdose.
    In September 2023, the IHS completed updates to IHM 3:35 Dispensing 
of Naloxone to First Responders and Community Representatives. These 
policy revisions expanded first responder definitions and reduced 
administrative burdens to naloxone access. As part of the expanded 
policy scope, the IHS collaborated with Bureau of Indian Education 
(BIE) Schools to develop and release a Naloxone in Schools toolkit to 
support school systems with expanding access to naloxone and overdose 
prevention efforts. The toolkit provides an example of training plans 
and materials that may be used to support school implementation. This 
toolkit is available on the IHS website.
    The IHS developed and released its ``Naloxone Keeps the Circle 
Strong'' campaign, which includes educational materials and additional 
IHS resources, including a new naloxone training to be used by and for 
community members, and a naloxone conversation starter guide for front-
line clinicians. All IHS Employees will receive opioid overdose and 
naloxone use training beginning in 2024.
Increase understanding of and access to drug checking equipment.
    In August 2023, the IHS started a fentanyl test strip pilot 
program, including sample policies and procedures, product labeling 
materials, educational documents, and procurement pathways. A total of 
four points of distribution have been identified with positive 
preliminary feedback. The IHS also created education materials on the 
use of fentanyl test strips for health care providers, community 
workers, and patients.
Workforce development and support
    IHS continues to support new strategies to leverage advanced 
practice providers and paraprofessionals to support opioid crisis 
response activities. In September 2022, the IHS renewed the IHS 
Advancing Pharmacist Roles in Substance Use Disorder Treatment and 
Recovery Teams Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes for a second 
year. This community of practice increases participant knowledge 
surrounding patient screening, assessments, evidence-based practices 
for managing Substance Use Disorders, and trauma-informed care 
principles. A new clinician mentorship program is set to launch later 
in December that includes opportunities for staffing patient cases and 
peer review to support new advanced practice pharmacists expanding 
services to include SUD treatment.
    The IHS will launch a community navigator program training 
community health representatives, community health aides, and public 
health aides in 2024. The training will include training in behavioral 
health navigation and whole-health approaches.
    The IHS is creating position descriptions for Peer Recovery Support 
Specialist staff to support recovery. The Peer Recovery specialists 
will reduce recidivism and assist the patient in re-integration into 
their family and community. Enhanced IHS collaboration with CMS and 
states to explore opportunities to leverage reimbursement parity 
between state Medicaid plans for outreach work provided by peer workers 
and community navigators is ongoing.
Treatment and Recovery
    The updated IHS Purchased Referred Care clinical priorities include 
acute detoxification and inpatient Alcohol/Substance Use Disorder as 
part of our priorities to more appropriately connect persons to 
treatment. This prioritized availability of referral to an appropriate 
program will provide access to immediate treatment for substance abuse 
disorders.
Challenges
    IHS appreciates the work of the Biden Administration to prioritize 
this crisis, and the work of Congress to secure additional resources to 
address urgent needs and remove barriers to care. The removal of the 
Drug Addiction Treatment Act waiver and other Federal efforts have 
helped, but more needs to be done. For example, there remains a lack of 
research and data related to effective SUD prevention and treatment 
interventions for American Indians and Alaskan Natives. We are still 
unable to quantify the extent of the disparity due to racial 
misclassification.
    The IHS supports the policy recommendations from the National 
Tribal Opioid Strategy to support ``housing first'' initiatives that 
include transitional housing/supportive housing and dedicated funding 
to establish pilot programs. Evaluation findings from the IHS COIPP 
grant reported homeless persons doubled since Year 1 (April 1, 2021 to 
March 31, 2022). Reports of the increase in housing insecurity could be 
linked to an increase in street outreach systems and an increase in 
opioid trafficking.
    Additionally, feedback from the field states there is a lack of 
resources for detoxification services for opioids for those 
contemplating entering treatment. Detoxification from opioids is 
challenging, and medically complex. There is often a requirement to 
enter residential treatment, and the current lack of services creates a 
barrier to treatment. It is crucial to have specific funding allocated 
to support detoxification services. This can act as an entry point to 
treatment and is essential for those struggling with addiction.
    The IHS values the ongoing support of federal partners to continue 
the critical work happening in tribal communities. We welcome 
additional opportunities to work together across government and with 
Congress to enhance programs, further support communities, and find 
solutions to resource challenges to address this scourge across Indian 
Country and the rest of our nation. Thank you for your commitment and 
dedication to improving health care for American Indians and Alaska 
Natives. I will be happy to answer any questions the Committee may 
have.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    Ms. Waldref, please proceed.

   STATEMENT OF HON. VANESSA WALDREF, U.S. ATTORNEY, EASTERN 
       DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

    Ms. Waldref. Good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chair 
Murkowski, and members of the Committee. Thank you for the 
opportunity to discuss the devastating effects the nationwide 
fentanyl crisis continues to have in Indian Country across the 
United States.
    The Department of Justice is committed to working in 
collaboration with tribal, Federal, State and local partners 
across Indian Country to respond to the fentanyl crisis, both 
through law enforcement action and supportive resources and 
prevention strategies.
    While Federal prosecutors have been prosecuting drug 
trafficking cases for many years, the nature and scope of drug 
trafficking has changed dramatically with the rise of illicit 
fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Traffickers can produce 
limitless amounts of illicit fentanyl if they have the 
appropriate chemicals and equipment, generating an 
unprecedented health crisis.
    Fentanyl overdoses are the leading cause of opioid-related 
deaths throughout the United States. American Indians, Alaska 
Natives, and Native Hawaiians are on the front lines of the 
fentanyl epidemic. The drug-related overdose death rate for 
Native Americans significantly exceeds the national rate.
    In the Eastern District of Washington, we have seen first-
hand how fentanyl and other drugs have affected our four tribal 
communities: the Confederated Tribes of the Colville 
Reservation, the Kalispell Tribe, the Spokane Tribe, and the 
Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakima Nation. Together, 
these tribal nations make up a land mass larger than the State 
of Connecticut.
    Much like other crises facing Native American populations, 
such as increased levels of domestic abuse, the climate crisis, 
violent crime, and the crisis of missing and murdered 
indigenous people, Native Americans in the Eastern District of 
Washington are disproportionately impacted by the fentanyl 
epidemic in Indian Country. In just two large takedowns this 
year, we seized approximately 161,000 fentanyl-laced pills 
intended for distribution on the Colville Indian Reservation, 
and approximately 120,000 fentanyl-laced pills just outside the 
Yakima Nation.
    The Department recognizes the widespread availability and 
misuse of drugs in Indian Country, coupled with drug-
trafficking groups operating in Indian Country, contributes to 
the high rates of crime on reservations. Every United States 
Attorney with Indian Country responsibilities has worked to 
develop strategies to address both drug trafficking crimes in 
Indian Country and the violent crimes that are associated with 
drug trafficking and substance abuse disorder.
    The United States Attorney's Offices rely on investigations 
coordinated by tribal, Federal, State and local partners, 
including the FBI's Safe Trails task forces that conduct many 
of the drug investigations in Indian Country. Tribal law 
enforcement provides invaluable assistance and intelligence 
related to drug trafficking in tribal communities. These task 
forces allow investigations to move beyond an individual tribal 
community and target drug traffickers prior to their arrival in 
Indian Country. Our office has prosecuted significant fentanyl 
cases through these partnerships.
    Though these criminal prosecutions are an important tool 
for addressing the fentanyl crisis in Indian Country, we must 
embrace a multi-faceted strategy that includes education, 
community outreach, and increased resources to combat substance 
use and misuse. Within our district, we have partnered with 
DEA's Operation Engage Initiative, a comprehensive community 
level approach that bridges public health and public safety.
    Last summer, Operation Engage worked with the Spokane Tribe 
of Indians through the Boys and Girls Club to host a day of fun 
activities focused on making healthy choices and increasing 
drug prevention and awareness. Future events led by tribal 
youth are planned for later this winter.
    We have also worked closely with the Spokane Alliance for 
Fentanyl Education, which partners with our office, law 
enforcement and community organizations to host public events 
raising awareness about the dangers of fentanyl and offering 
supportive services.
    The Department is also dedicated to improving programs to 
assist tribal members that are re-entering the community 
following periods of confinement. Next year, the department's 
Bureau of Justice Assistance will be holding tribal 
intergovernmental reentry workshops to identify critical 
services needed to reduce recidivism and victimization.
    I am proud of the investigative and prosecution efforts in 
our district and other Indian Country districts throughout the 
United States to remove fentanyl from Native American 
communities. We will continue to work in partnership with 
tribal, Federal, State and local partners to effectuate a 
multi-faceted approach and response to the fentanyl epidemic.
    We appreciate this Committee's focus on this devastating 
issue, and are committed to working with you going forward. 
Thank you again for the opportunity to participate today.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Waldref follows:]

  Prepared Statement of Hon. Vanessa Waldref, U.S. Attorney, Eastern 
           District of Washington, U.S. Department of Justice
    Good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and 
Members of the Committee. My name is Vanessa Waldref. I am the United 
States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington. Thank you for 
the opportunity to discuss the devasting effects that the nationwide 
fentanyl crisis continues to have in Indian country across the United 
States and its impact on public safety. The Department of Justice is 
committed to working in collaboration with Tribal, federal, state, and 
local partners across Indian country to respond to the fentanyl crisis 
both through law enforcement action and supportive resources and 
strategies.
Background
    While federal prosecutors have been prosecuting drug trafficking 
cases for many years, the nature and scope of drug trafficking has 
changed dramatically with the rise of illicit fentanyl and other 
synthetic opioids. Unlike heroin or cocaine, which are derived from 
plants, illicit fentanyl is made in a laboratory. Traffickers who 
distribute these drugs do not need to worry about growing seasons or 
droughts impacting the availability of drugs. Rather, they can produce 
limitless amounts of illicit fentanyl if they have the appropriate 
chemicals and equipment. Access to the items is often readily available 
at the click of a button. The resulting explosion in the availability 
of illicit fentanyl has generated a public health crisis unlike 
anything this nation has ever seen.
    A majority of the drug poisoning (or overdose) deaths in the United 
States involve illicit fentanyl, which in the Eastern District of 
Washington is distributed predominantly in the form of fake 
pharmaceuticals, although fentanyl also is being mixed with other 
illicit drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. In fact, in 
March 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
identified fentanyl poisoning and overdoses as the number one killer of 
Americans ages 18-45. I have heard heart-wrenching stories from 
families in my community about the loss of children and loved ones to 
fentanyl poisoning and witnessed the DEA's Faces of Fentanyl Wall that 
commemorates the lives lost to this epidemic. Unfortunately, these 
devastating stories have become all too common. Each day approximately 
275 American lives are lost largely from synthetic opioids such as 
fentanyl poisoning. In 2021, the CDC reported nearly 107,000 overdose 
or poisoning deaths--approximately sixty-six percent of these were 
attributable to synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. \1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Fake pharmaceutical pills often are made to appear legitimate using 
pill presses and are marketed by drug traffickers to deceive Americans 
into thinking that they are real, diverted prescription medications. In 
reality, these fake pills are not made by pharmaceutical companies but 
by drug trafficking organizations, and they are potentially deadly. 
Drug traffickers also make fake pills, many of which contain fentanyl, 
that are brightly colored, or glow in the dark, and are clearly 
intended to appeal to youth. \2\ These pills often are referred to on 
the streets of our communities as skittles, rainbows, and glow in the 
dark. DEA lab testing reveals that today 7 out of 10 of fentanyl-laced 
fake prescription pills contain a potentially lethal dose. In some 
cases, users may think they are purchasing Adderall, oxycodone, Xanax 
or some other drug that was produced in a factory using quality control 
standards. Instead, these users are ingesting pills that were made in 
makeshift labs without any regard for safety. Given that even two 
milligrams of fentanyl can be deadly, a 30-milligram fake Adderall 
tablet could easily contain several lethal doses within just one pill. 
A single fentanyl-laced pill often contains varying levels of fentanyl 
throughout the whole pill. There have been numerous instances of 
friends sharing a pill, where one half of the pill has a lethal dose 
and the other does not, killing one friend and not the other. \3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Federal prosecutors around the country are working closely with our 
Tribal, federal, state, and local partners to identify and prosecute 
the drug traffickers who seek to profit from the sale of these deadly 
substances in our communities. We target the command and control 
elements of the cartels, the money launderers, and the violent and 
heartless individuals who choose to sell this poison. Through our law 
enforcement efforts, we are seeking to hold these criminals responsible 
for the damage that they have caused to our communities.
The Fentanyl Crisis in Indian Country
    Fentanyl overdoses are the leading cause of opioid-related deaths 
throughout the United States, including Indian country. American 
Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians are on the front lines of 
the fentanyl epidemic. The drug-related overdose death rate for Native 
Americans significantly exceeds the national rate--rising to 56.6 
deaths per 100,000 persons in 2021. \4\ The CDC has further stated that 
the overdose death rate for Native Americans is higher than in any 
other racial or ethnic group. Indian Health Service data similarly 
shows that Tribal communities are experiencing an increase in overdoses 
stemming from polysubstance use, many of which arise when a person 
unintentionally takes drugs mixed or cut with other substances. \5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In the Eastern District of Washington, we have seen first-hand how 
fentanyl and other drugs have affected Tribal communities. Families and 
under-resourced communities have been devastated by this crisis, 
compounding decades of generational trauma suffered by the Native 
American communities in our District.
    Within our District there are four Tribal Nations that together 
make up a land mass larger than Connecticut. These proud Tribal Nations 
include the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the 
Kalispel Tribe, Spokane Tribe, and the Confederated Tribes and Bands 
Yakama Nation. Of course, the entirety of Eastern Washington is the 
ancestral home of Salish-speaking people indigenous to this land. For 
several centuries, the Salish people have cared for this land, which 
includes their historical hunting grounds throughout our abundant 
forest, and they have harvested the salmon that once spawned in the 
mountain streams and rivers that give life to Eastern Washington.
    Eastern Washington's Tribal Nations--which in many cases are hours 
from the nearest FBI office or federal courthouse--are remote and 
relatively rural. The rural nature of this land, however, has not 
spared our Native American communities from the realities of fentanyl. 
Much like other crises facing Native American populations--such as 
increased levels of domestic abuse, the climate crisis, violent crime, 
and the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous people--Native 
Americans in Eastern Washington are disproportionately impacted by the 
current crisis involving the prolific distribution and use of fentanyl 
in Indian country. I would like to walk through some examples from our 
District:

  <bullet> Earlier this year, we made one of the largest-ever seizures 
        in our District in a case that involved significant 
        distribution on the Colville Indian Reservation: United States 
        v. Erubey Arciga Medrano. As part of a joint investigation 
        involving Montana and Eastern Washington, the Bureau of Indian 
        Affairs (BIA), DEA, FBI and other federal agencies seized 
        approximately 161,000 fentanyl-laced pills, approximately 80 
        pounds of methamphetamine, approximately 6 pounds of heroin, 
        and more than 2 pounds of cocaine. This included several 
        thousands of rainbow-colored fentanyl-laced pills that appeared 
        to target youth. The BIA, DEA, FBI and their partners also 
        seized approximately 12 firearms. A significant portion of the 
        drugs, which were seized in rural Oroville, Washington, 
        allegedly were destined for the Colville Reservation, as well 
        as for other Native American communities and surrounding areas 
        in Washington and Montana. Following the seizure in April 2023, 
        we saw a significant reduction in illegal narcotics on the 
        Colville Reservation.

  <bullet> In January of this year, my office announced a takedown in 
        Yakima County, Washington, involving the seizure of more than 
        approximately 120,000 fentanyl-laced pills and more than 42 
        pounds of methamphetamine. In United States v. Eliseo Equihua-
        Zamora, the FBI and its local partners also seized a loaded 
        Beretta pistol and approximately $152,000 in U.S. currency, 
        including approximately $100,000 that was buried outside the 
        residence that was searched. These drugs also were believed to 
        be destined, at least in part, for the Yakama Nation.

  <bullet> In another case, United States v. Andre Picard, the 
        Defendant, who resided on the Colville Indian Reservation, was 
        prosecuted in connection with the overdose death of a young 
        Native American mother, who purchased drugs from Picard. During 
        the investigation, significant quantities of fentanyl were 
        recovered from Picard, who was distributing fentanyl and other 
        drugs out of his own home. Picard was sentenced to 5 years in 
        federal prison earlier this summer. Significantly, the quantity 
        of fentanyl and other drugs recovered during the Picard 
        investigation was not particularly large; however, cases like 
        this demonstrate the disparate impact of fentanyl on vulnerable 
        populations. We have seen multiple overdose deaths that have 
        resulted even when just a handful of pills are distributed on 
        Native American reservations in our District.

The Department's Efforts to Respond to the Fentanyl Crisis in Indian 
        Country
    On November 15, 2021, the President issued Executive Order 14053, 
Improving Public Safety and Criminal Justice for Native Americans and 
Addressing the Crisis of Missing or Murdered Indigenous People, 
outlining the Administration's commitment to work hand in hand with 
Tribal Nations and Tribal partners to build safe and healthy Tribal 
communities and support comprehensive law enforcement, prevention, 
intervention, and support services.
    In fulfilling the directives of the Executive Order, the Department 
recognizes that the widespread availability and abuse of drugs in 
Indian country, coupled with drug trafficking groups operating in 
Indian country, contribute to the high rates of crimes on reservations, 
including violent crime. Therefore, the Department has worked to create 
strategies that address both drug trafficking crimes in Indian country 
and the violent crimes that are associated with either drug trafficking 
or substance use disorder.
    As part of those efforts, the Department throughout 2022 held a 
series of consultations with Tribal leaders and stakeholders as part of 
Executive Order 14053. During those consultations, the Department heard 
about the unique challenges that each Tribal community faces in 
addressing drug trafficking and substance use disorders and how the 
prevalent substances and available treatment options vary from Tribe to 
Tribe.
    In response to the Tribal consultations, in July 2022, the Deputy 
Attorney General issued a memorandum requiring each United States 
Attorney to consult with relevant Tribal, federal, state, and local law 
enforcement agencies in their districts and to develop a strategy to 
combat drug trafficking. In developing strategies, United States 
Attorneys are to consider targeted prosecutions that have the most 
significant impact on public safety in individual Tribal communities. 
Recognizing that enforcement alone cannot solve the substance misuse 
crisis in Indian country, United States Attorneys also were directed to 
partner with other Department components to provide a wide range of 
resources and conduct outreach.
    I, and the 50 other United States Attorneys with Indian country 
responsibilities, followed the Deputy Attorney General's directive and 
worked to implement coordinated and collaborative strategies to combat 
drug trafficking that has caused such catastrophic impact to Tribal 
communities throughout the United States. As mentioned earlier, our 
office has prosecuted significant fentanyl cases, targeting activity 
which has negatively affected the Tribes within our District. Further, 
our office, along with other United States Attorney's Offices, have 
coordinated and collaborated with Tribal, federal, state, and local 
partners to provide education, resources, and outreach.
    The United States Attorney's Offices rely on investigations 
coordinated by Tribal, federal, state, and local partners. The FBI 
utilizes Safe Trails Task Forces that conduct many of the drug 
investigations in Indian country. These task forces include officers 
from Tribal, federal, state, and local agencies that work in 
coordination and collaboration within the local communities they serve. 
Tribal law enforcement task force officers provide invaluable 
assistance and intelligence related to the drug trafficking in Tribal 
communities and the identification of suspects. Further, the task force 
model allows investigations to move beyond an individual Tribal 
community and target drug traffickers prior to their arrival in Indian 
country. The DEA provides significant resources to further target 
cartel operatives and conduct wide-reaching investigations. The DEA and 
FBI, in partnership with BIA, Tribal, state, and local law enforcement, 
reach the source of supply, not just the local dealer.
Prevention and Education
    Though criminal prosecutions, like the ones I outlined earlier, are 
an important tool for addressing the fentanyl crisis in Indian country, 
we must do more. It cannot be said enough that enforcement operations 
alone will not stop the flow of fentanyl and other controlled 
substances to Tribal communities. To combat this crisis and the other 
crises disproportionately affecting Native American populations, we 
must embrace a multi-faceted strategy that includes prevention, 
education, community outreach, and increased resources to combat 
substance use disorder. Our District is already engaging in proactive 
measures to implement this type of multi-faceted strategic approach.
    Within our District, we have partnered with the DEA's Operation 
Engage initiative, a comprehensive community-level approach that 
bridges public health and public safety to address the drug epidemic by 
implementing prevention strategies, facilitating conversations, and 
collaborating with local partners. During the summer 2022, Operation 
Engage worked with the Spokane Tribe of Indians through the Boys and 
Girls Club in Wellpinit, Washington, to host a day of learning and 
activities that focused on making healthy choices, protecting your 
brain, and increasing drug prevention/awareness, all in the context of 
a fun environment. Another event is scheduled for early winter 2023.
    Operation Engage currently is leading a group of community members 
who are planning a Youth Cultural Event for this winter. The event will 
bring Tribal youth together to discuss the dangers of fentanyl and 
bring education, awareness, and sustainable programs to Tribal 
communities. The goal is to have youth lead this event, which will 
include the Kalispel, Spokane, and Colville Tribes.
    We also have worked closely with the Spokane Alliance for Fentanyl 
Education (SAFE) and the Rayce Rudeen Foundation, which consists of a 
Board of Directors from all facets of our community, including from the 
Tribes in our District. SAFE has put on numerous community events, 
including a recent youth summit where high school students from Tribal 
Nations joined in a unified voice of support and assistance for those 
facing fentanyl misuse.
    SAFE, the Rayce Rudeen Foundation, and Operation Engage have also 
participated in round table discussions with Tribal leaders about 
promoting awareness programs within the community and trainings for 
administering naloxone to overdose victims. Our office is actively 
engaged in SAFE, and the leader of our Violent Crime and Drug 
Trafficking Section, along with several stakeholders from the greater 
Spokane community, serves on SAFE's Board of Directors, providing 
essential insight and education to the community on how the fentanyl 
crisis impacts vulnerable communities and Tribal nations.
Addiction and Reentry
    The Department also is dedicated to improving programs to assist 
Tribal members that are reentering the community following periods of 
confinement. For individuals returning from incarceration, successful 
reentry depends on intergovernmental collaboration that is responsive 
to both community and returnees' needs, so that chances for drug use 
and recidivism are minimized and public health and safety are 
maximized. This is especially true in Tribal communities, where the 
complex nature of jurisdiction makes coordination among Tribal, 
federal, state, and local justice systems particularly challenging. 
When Tribal members reenter their communities without adequate support, 
the risk of drug use and violence is greatly increased.
    In 2024, the Department's Bureau of Justice Assistance will be 
holding in-person, state-based Tribal Intergovernmental Reentry (TIRW) 
Workshops. These interactive events will provide participants with 
tools to develop effective reentry plans based on the sharing of 
operational, organizational, and culture-based concepts and processes 
that result in the identification of critical services and 
interventions needed to reduce recidivism, relapse, and victimization. 
The Eastern District of Washington is committed to working closely with 
Tribal Nations to engage in these workshops, which will include the 
U.S. Attorney's Office, Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Probation, and 
their Tribal court counterparts.
Closing
    I am proud of the investigative and prosecution efforts in our 
District and the other Indian country districts throughout the United 
States to remove fentanyl from vulnerable populations, such as our 
Native American communities. At the same time, United States Attorneys 
do not simply prosecute criminals.
    Many United States Attorneys are active in their Tribal communities 
and are seeking new and innovative ways to connect with our youth, 
educate the community about the dangers of fentanyl, and help citizens 
save lives by administering naloxone to their friends or family who 
overdose. Our commitment to serving Indian country goes beyond 
prosecution. We are public servants who want to do all we can to make 
Tribal communities stronger and safer. To accomplish that goal, we will 
continue to work in partnership with Tribal, federal, state, and local 
partners to effectuate a multi-faceted response to the fentanyl 
epidemic. We appreciate this committee's focus on this devastating 
issue and are committed to working with you going forward. Thank you 
again for the opportunity to participate today.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Melville, please proceed.

           STATEMENT OF GLEN MELVILLE, BUREAU DEPUTY 
         DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, OFFICE OF 
                        JUSTICE SERVICES

    Mr. Melville. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, 
Vice Chair Murkowski, and members of the Committee. My name is 
Glen Melville, I am an enrolled member of the Makah Tribe of 
Northwest Washington, and I serve as the Deputy Bureau Director 
for the Bureau of Indian Affairs Office of Justice Services
    Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the fentanyl 
crisis affecting Native communities throughout the United 
States.
    The United States has a trust relationship with each of the 
574 federally recognized tribes. As a part of that 
relationship, we have a trust obligation to protect the 
continued existence of Indian tribes and the physical security 
of their citizens. BIA plays a crucial role in meeting this 
obligation.
    Office of Justice Services employs 352 uniformed police 
officers and criminal investigators serving over 200 Indian 
communities across the Country. We have several law enforcement 
supporting operations and functions, which include the Missing 
and Murdered Unit, Victim Assistance, Drug Enforcement, 
Internal Affairs, Land Mobile Radio Program, Indian Highway 
Safety, Tribal Justice Support, and the operation of the Indian 
Police Academy.
    The Office of Justice Services also conducts investigations 
that include but are not limited to violent crimes against 
persons, illegal narcotics, gangs, human trafficking, and 
border violations in Indian Country. We have a specialized 
division of drug enforcement that tracks and investigates the 
distribution of illegal narcotics in Indian Country.
    The drug-related activity in tribal communities imposes 
health and economic hardship as a major contributor to the 
violent crime in Indian Country. Our Division of Drug 
Enforcement has identified methamphetamine and fentanyl as the 
biggest emerging drug threats to our tribal communities.
    Tribes have reported 1,590 fatal overdoses in Fiscal Year 
2023, and 899 non-fatal overdoses. In addition to fentanyl, 
other synthetic opioids are becoming more prevalent, such as 
carfentanil. Carfentanil is used as a medical tranquilizer for 
large animals, including elephants. It is estimated to be 100 
times more potent than fentanyl.
    So far there have only been limited seizures of carfentanil 
in Indian Country, but experts estimate there are about 25 to 
30 different chemical versions of fentanyl that are often more 
powerful and dangerous. So far, only one death in Indian County 
has been attributed to Carfentanil.
    In response to the illegal drug epidemic, many of these 
tribal justice systems have incorporated traditional and 
culturally appropriate solutions to address the drug addictions 
within their communities, through healing to wellness courts. 
Tribal healing to wellness courts are experiencing some 
successes in addressing behaviors and are seeing reduced 
recidivism rates. These success rates demonstrate that the 
tribes are best suited to provide solutions to the challenges 
within their communities.
    The department supports the work of tribal justice systems 
to ensure the safety of their communities and people.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am 
pleased to answer any questions you might have.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Melville follows:]

Prepared Statement of Glen Melville, Bureau Deputy Director, Bureau of 
               Indian Affairs, Office of Justice Services
    Good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and 
members of the Committee. My name is Glen Melville, and I am the Deputy 
Bureau Director for the Office of Justice Services (OJS) at the Bureau 
of Indian Affairs (BIA) in the U.S. Department of the Interior 
(Department). Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the impacts of 
fentanyl in Indian Country.
Background
    The United States has a trust relationship with each of the 574 
federally recognized Tribes, and their Tribal citizens. Through these 
relationships, the United States has charged itself with obligations of 
the highest responsibility and trust--including the obligation to 
protect the existence of Indian Tribes and their citizens. This 
obligation is at its highest when it comes to protecting the physical 
safety and well-being of Indian people within Indian country. BIA OJS 
plays a crucial role in meeting this obligation on behalf of the United 
States. Drug related activity in Tribal communities is a major 
contributor to violent crime and imposes health and economic hardship, 
and it is continuing to escalate throughout Indian Country.
    OJS conducts investigations on narcotics, gangs, human trafficking, 
and border violations in Indian Country. OJS also has a specialized 
national drug enforcement division, the Division of Drug Enforcement 
(DDE), that investigates the distribution of illegal narcotics in 
Indian Country. The DDE provides investigations that focus on 
disrupting drug distribution networks and analytical support to track 
drug cases that directly impact Indian Country. The DDE also offers 
drug related training and technical assistance to law enforcement 
programs that operate in Indian Country.
Current Drug Seizure Totals
    Each year, our DDE plans and executes multiple undercover narcotic 
and highway interdiction operations throughout Indian Country. The 
operations will typically range from 4 to 14 days, where assigned 
special agents and police officers focus efforts solely on a specific 
reservation. The number and success of these operations is the 
strongest driver of our annual illegal drug seizures. During FY 2023, 
twenty-two such operations were completed, leading to seizure totals 
of:

  <bullet> Fentanyl Pills: 1,097,671
  <bullet> Methamphetamine: 1,846 lbs.
  <bullet> Fentanyl Powder: 98 lbs.
  <bullet> Marijuana: 11,411 lbs.
  <bullet> Heroin: 23 lbs.
  <bullet> Cocaine: 1,418 lbs.

Current Drug Threats and Impact on Tribal Communities
    Nationwide activities of our drug enforcement team are identifying 
methamphetamine and fentanyl as the prevalent emerging drug threats to 
the safety of Tribal communities. Tribes reported 1,590 fatal overdoses 
in FY 2023 and 899 non-fatal overdoses.
    American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiians, are all 
seeing significant impacts from opioids. Since the emergence of 
fentanyl in Indian Country, we have seen increases in overdose deaths 
in Indian Communities. In addition to fentanyl, other synthetic opioids 
are becoming more prevalent. One example is carfentanil, medically used 
as a tranquilizer for elephants and large mammals, it is estimated to 
be 100 times more potent than fentanyl. One Indian Country overdose 
death has been attributed to carfentanil so far. Limited seizures have 
been seen to date; however, the emergence of this and other similar 
substances is likely on the horizon as -our communities encounter other 
fentanyl analogues and fentanyl-related substances, which are 
chemically similar to fentanyl and, in some cases, more powerful.
    While the data conveys the seriousness of these threats, we are 
unable to measure the resulting impact to victims, affected families, 
and the already strained Tribal justice and social service systems in 
these communities. However, Tribal officials have consistently called 
for action toward addressing this increasingly common cause of crime in 
Indian Country and Tribal justice systems are incorporating traditional 
and cultural practices to support their communities.
Healing to Wellness Tribal Courts
    Many Tribes are reforming or creating judicial systems which 
incorporate traditional and cultural aspects to create a more effective 
measure to address the trauma induced circumstances within their 
communities through Healing to Wellness Tribal Courts.
    Healing to Wellness courts have provided positive results in 
healing and strengthening Tribal communities. For example, Penobscot 
Nation has not incarcerated a defendant this year, but has graduated 
individuals from the Healing to Wellness court and provided 
participants with options for higher education and resulted in 
commitments to work to create a safer and better community.
Penobscot Healing to Wellness Court
    According to the Tribal judges at Penobscot, fentanyl is a major 
concern for Tribal justice systems, especially for Tribal Healing to 
Wellness Courts. Fentanyl shows up in criminal cases and child 
dependency cases as the main reason for unhealthy Native communities.
    The Healing to Wellness Court has seen exceptional success with 
addressing recovery from fentanyl use for the individuals participating 
in the Healing to Wellness Court. The Healing to Wellness Court uses 
many avenues for treatment, including culturally relevant practices to 
successfully address an individual's behavior. Adults are immediately 
transferred to a hospital for 7-10 days to detox and a Healing to 
Wellness case manage manages the adult's 30-90-day inpatient treatment 
while providing biweekly updates to the Healing to Wellness Court. Once 
the adult individual graduates from the inpatient treatment, they enter 
a sober living facility within the Healing to Wellness court's 
jurisdiction.
    It's also important to note that since the Penobscot Healing to 
Wellness Court opened its doors to Tribal members charged by the State, 
Tribal members using fentanyl have sought to be admitted to the Healing 
to Wellness court. Penobscot has seen a 60 percent success rate for 
Tribal members within their Healing to Wellness court with only two re-
offenders.
    The Penobscot Tribal Court noted that the cost of addressing 
fentanyl is much less in the Healing to Wellness courts. For example, 
the annual cost for incarceration is approximately $60,000.00 -$90,000, 
while the cost of addressing Tribal fentanyl users in the Healing to 
Wellness court is approximately $12,000.00 to $15,000.00, depending on 
the level of care. Not only is the cost lower, but the recidivism rate 
is also far less.
    Tribal courts are an essential aspect of Tribal sovereignty and are 
an opportunity for Tribes to run their own justice systems. There are 
approximately 400 Tribal justice systems throughout the Nation. The 
OJS, Tribal Justice Support provides training, technical assistance, 
and funding for the operation, maintenance, and support of Tribal 
Justice Systems.
    The focus of all these courts is to address issues ``upstream'' 
instead of dealing with ultimately tragic issues which debilitate our 
communities. Tribes are better suited to provide best practices and 
discuss challenges with their peers.
Conclusion
    The Department continues to prioritize and reinforce Tribal 
sovereignty and self-determination by providing support and resources 
to improving public safety in Indian Country.
    Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and members of the 
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to provide the Department's 
views. We look forward to working with Congress to affirm and support 
Tribal sovereignty and public safety within Tribal communities. I am 
happy to answer any questions that you may have.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much. I will start with Mr. 
Cohen, and I am going to go down the line.
    At our hearing last month, tribal leaders testified that 
producers and traffickers routinely target Indian reservations 
due to the jurisdictional maze, and the resulting gaps in law 
enforcement. What are your agencies doing to reduce those gaps? 
I will start with you, Mr. Cohen.
    Mr. Cohen. Thank you for the question, Chairman Schatz. I 
think that there are clearly seams between some of the law 
enforcement efforts. But organizations like the HIDTA that 
comes out of the ONDCP are synchronizers of that kind of 
effort. They try to fill those gaps as best as possible.
    The Chairman. I get the structure. I am not trying to be 
adversarial here. I get the structure, and that would be the 
concept. But then I hear from tribal leaders who feel like best 
laid plans, that there still remain these gaps. How do we close 
them on the ground?
    Mr. Cohen. It is important for us to continue to drive home 
the idea of the force multiplying impact of the multi-agency. 
In the HIDTA program, we have 33 HIDTAs nationwide, 14 of them 
are directly engaged with tribal nations across the United 
States and tribal law enforcement. We have actually had quite a 
bit of success in those 14. In those 14, they seized over $414 
million in assets over the last year.
    There are places for improvement. But I think our 
investments are being well spent so far.
    The Chairman. Ms. Tso?
    Ms. Tso. Thank you for that question, Chairman.
    The work that we are doing at the Indian Health Service is 
collaborating across HHS first. I want to make sure all my 
colleagues at HHS understand the challenges of Indian Country. 
I referenced in my earlier statement the trip out to South 
Dakota. For some of my colleagues, that is their first time out 
in Indian Country.
    So understanding some of the challenges, the distances that 
our people have to drive and the limited resources that we have 
to address this is the first step. Then there are other tools 
that we are building now and continue to build with our tribal 
partners to talk about and to develop strategies by which we 
can address these and working very closely with our tribal 
partners for each community. Because it is not a one-size-fits-
all, and so we are looking at that. Utilizing the resources 
that we have to make sure that they are put out there in Indian 
Country, to again work with our partners to develop the best 
practices that can be shared across Indian Country.
    The Chairman. So for you in particular, and I am going to 
get to Ms. Waldref, but for you in particular, you have the 
kind of inter and intra agency stuff, right? Because you have 
SAMHSA and some other agencies that may not have deep 
familiarity with working with Indian Country. So you kind of 
have to work within your parent agency and then across 
agencies.
    I want to turn this into a question for the record, partly 
because I feel like these hearings can be a little bit of a 
gotcha. I am also not satisfied that we are filling the gaps. I 
think we are trying. I think we have, it is sort of like a golf 
coach--I am not a good golfer--but it is sort of like, keep 
your eye on the ball, a bunch of things that we ought to be 
doing. Sure, we ought to be doing it, but executing that is the 
hard part. I don't quite see the execution, not because I have 
special visibility, but because tribal leaders told me that as 
recently as last month.
    So I don't think we are there yet. This is not a personal 
criticism. But I do think we need to do a little more work in 
this space.
    Ms. Waldref?
    Ms. Waldref. Thank you, Chairman. The Department of Justice 
and individual U.S. Attorneys offices have jurisdiction to 
prosecute Federal drug crimes. There can be a jurisdictional 
challenge in addressing other violent crimes on Indian 
reservations, depending on the jurisdictional makeup of each 
individual State.
    The United States Attorneys offices, consistent with 
Savanna's Act and the Department of Justice guidelines, each 
office works very closely with the tribal partners in their 
district. For every tribe we develop an operational plan to 
ensure that we can fill any jurisdictional gaps and have 
appropriate investigative resources available so that we can 
build cases and have them charged federally as appropriate.
    The Chairman. In my remaining time, is that something that 
you are doing in the Eastern District or that every U.S. 
Attorney is doing as a matter of DOJ policy?
    Ms. Waldref. Chairman, both. In the Department of Justice, 
every United States Attorney's office has an operational plan 
for working with each individual tribe for which they consult 
with the tribes to get valuable input to ensure that the tribe 
is weighing in on what are the largest needs for that 
community, so the United States Attorney's office can be 
responsive to those needs.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    Vice Chair Murkowski?
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to 
our witnesses.
    I want to start with you, Deputy Director Cohen. I have 
been a big supporter of what HIDTA does. I think we have seen 
some results overall in Alaska. You mentioned in your written 
testimony that the HIDTA Tribal Task Force across the Country 
has been able to seize $414 million in illicit drugs, cash and 
other assets from traffickers. In total, all HIDTAs have seized 
an estimated $22 billion just in 2022 alone, allowing the 
return of $82 for every $1 spent on their budgets. So it sounds 
like this is an effort that is worth funding.
    The question is, you have a relatively large return there. 
We have heard from everybody on this panel, and we know in this 
Committee that those that are being most impacted right now 
disproportionately are American Indians, Alaska Natives, and 
Native Hawaiians.
    So you have $290 million going toward the HIDTA program, 
apparently, in the Fiscal Year 2024 budget. I am curious to 
know whether we have specific tribal priorities or setasides 
included in that funding. So do you have a portion that is set 
aside for this population that we have identified as clearly 
being most impacted right now?
    Mr. Cohen. My understanding of the proposal for the Fiscal 
Year 2024 budget is that there is not a dedicated setaside.
    Senator Murkowski. Should there be, given the statistics, 
given what we know, given the impact on Indian Country and 
Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians?
    Mr. Cohen. I think it is something that is worth 
considering.
    The important thing to understand about the HIDTA program, 
as you have noted is that there is genuine return on 
investment. Most importantly, it is this idea that the HIDTAs 
are locally driven law enforcement strategies. It is not 
Washington telling the field how to operate.
    So what you have is 33 HIDTAs across the United States 
which are bringing together Federal, local, State and tribal 
law enforcement, and more pointedly for this hearing, in 14 
instances tribal law enforcement directly partnering with law 
enforcement to create the force multiplier that I mentioned a 
moment ago.
    And the fact that they can actually look at what is going 
on in their community and try to tailor their law enforcement 
approach is critically important to us.
    Senator Murkowski. Let me ask also, we understand that the 
White House is developing this clearinghouse for tribes to 
apply for Federal funding. We hear very clearly that you have 
tribal leaders commenting that it has been hard to access the 
Federal resources. It is a cumbersome process, apparently.
    When is this clearinghouse expected to go live? What have 
we done to make sure that the processes are easier for the 
tribes to apply for the funding?
    Mr. Cohen. At last year's tribal summit, we heard a lot of 
feedback from the tribes that it was very difficult for them to 
manage grants.gov and figure out all these different locations 
to get other resources. So the White House has launched this 
effort to try to create this clearinghouse. We were in the 
midst of doing that, I don't have a date for you today. I can 
try to get back to you with a little bit more fidelity.
    But we are working very hard to ensure that that 
clearinghouse is the user friendly clearinghouse that we have 
heard from the field that we need. From an ONDCP perspective, 
we are going to make sure that ONDCP resources are in that 
clearinghouse, and then we also have at ONDCP a forward-facing 
location where tribes can go to find all drug related, 
narcotics related grants.
    Senator Murkowski. Again, we hear this a lot. We put in 
place these programs, we fund these programs and then it is 
just hard for those on the ground, for the tribes to actually 
be able to access them. So we may as well just be putting it 
out there and putting up a glass wall in terms of access. We 
have to address that. So I would urge you to move on this 
clearinghouse, to make this process easier.
    I will tell you, and this is not necessarily a question to 
anyone, but I come from a State where the only way in, the only 
way in for these drugs is when they come through the email and 
when they come on an airplane on somebody's body. It is two 
ways, because you are not driving it in, very few are boating 
it in. Our reality is we know that it is being flown in.
    And the fact that it is getting into these tiny, tiny, tiny 
little villages where the only way in is that bush carrier and 
knowing that in that cargo hold or on that person are hundreds, 
maybe 1,000 fentanyl pills that could wipe out every single 
person in that village and then some, and we can't figure out 
how we can address the flow into these rural communities. It is 
killing us in a way that is just--it is beyond comprehension, 
really.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Vice Chair.
    Senator Cantwell?
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I think I am going to follow the two of you in this line of 
questioning, and just keep digging on why this is such a 
prevalent problem for the populations that we are talking 
about. Mr. Melville, it is good to know that you are an 
enrolled Makah. That means you know what remote is, and how 
remote Indian Country can be.
    I want to welcome the Yakima Nation who is here in the 
audience.
    The amount of volume that we are uncovering in Indian 
Country in various reservations, whether you are talking about 
the Colville and the 160,000-plus pills for a population of 
about 7,000 people, enrolled members, or Yakima or some of 
these other places says to me that it is not just the 
population that they are after, that perhaps this is also a 
location to run operations out of, because there isn't enough 
law enforcement in the region.
    Are we seeing data on this? We had this big bust up in 
Lummi, and Lummi is very close to the Canadian border. We 
needed the help of the FBI to bust up that ring.
    So are we seeing people not just preying on this 
population, which they clearly are preying on this population, 
as Senator Murkowski described, but in addition, it is just a 
good place to operate their facilities from? Does anybody have 
a comment on that? Mr. Melville.
    Mr. Melville. Thank you, Senator. Absolutely.
    There is a well-known fact in the Mexican cartels that if 
you can go onto an Indian reservation and work your way into an 
Indian reservation, that that is an area they know they can try 
to utilize and manipulate. Because they know that the tribal 
police officers are only really in charge of or looking at 
their tribal members.
    Visitors, there is a myriad of jurisdiction everywhere you 
go. Washington is especially difficult with tribal 
jurisdiction, State jurisdiction and Federal jurisdiction. So 
they have figured out that that is a place that they want to 
try to go and get a foothold. It is very, very difficult in 
some of these remote areas for these task forces to be able to 
operate. Because as soon as you drive onto the Makah Indian 
reservation, everybody knows you are there already. There is 
one way in, one way out. Any strange cars come in that are not 
known, people talk about it.
    If you are driving an SUV that looks like a government 
vehicle, you are not going to be able to do much surveillance. 
So our drug division is very, very intuitive and inventive in 
the way they try to get into those areas and try to work with 
the tribes and the task forces to try to root that out.
    That is one of the things that they work on. But it is a 
very, very difficult area to work in.
    Senator Cantwell. Anybody else on that point? Yes.
    Ms. Waldref. Thank you, Senator.
    There are certainly challenges in addressing the 
trafficking drugs in rural communities. You have identified a 
lot of them. The same strategies that we have found throughout 
rural communities in eastern Washington have been effective in 
addressing drug trafficking on our tribal lands as well. That 
is really trying to have, using resources like HIDTA, and our 
task force, Safe Trails task forces, so that we have accurate 
information from our tribal law enforcement members. Because 
they really know what is going on on the ground.
    So if those tribal law enforcement members can be either 
task force officers or have the special law enforcement 
commissions, those are extremely valuable tools for us to be 
able to bring Federal prosecutions effectively.
    Senator Cantwell. Senator Mullin and I both have sponsored 
legislation, the Tribal Law Enforcement Parity Act, which would 
help tribes with law enforcement self-governance contracts in 
retaining law enforcement. So I certainly support that. I 
certainly support more resources for local task force bottom 
up.
    But I was also trying to get at just this notion that not 
only are they preying on a population, they are also finding a 
good place to hide. Is that correct?
    Ms. Waldref. There are challenges in rural communities. We 
have that throughout the Eastern District, both in and around 
the Yakima area and Yakima Valley as well as in northeast 
Washington, where there are rural communities that can be areas 
to hide those drugs.
    What we do to try to address that and to effectively 
prosecute these cases is having the most effective information 
sharing that we possibly can, which is using all of our 
information sharing resources, such as HIDTA, our task forces, 
and our DEA and BIA cross-designated partners.
    Senator Cantwell. Just to be clear, what is the data change 
that we need to do that you think is, who do you think needs to 
get us better data?
    Ms. Waldref. We could always be partnering with this 
Committee to try to provide the data information that we can. 
We are working with our tribal partners on gathering that 
information and would be happy to support this Committee's 
interest in additional information about the impact of fentanyl 
in our Indian Country communities.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you. I know my time is expired, Mr. 
Chairman, but I do think that improving the data connection was 
something the Northwest Indian Health Board out of Portland has 
talked about, and I know that leaders here, that we need to, we 
will get something for the record asking Director Cohen about 
that.
    Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Mullin.

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARKWAYNE MULLIN, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM OKLAHOMA

    Senator Mullin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for 
holding this hearing, thank you to all the panelists.
    I was fortunate enough to be raised in Indian Country my 
whole life. Still live there, and I raise my kids there to 
stay. The opioid crisis, which started this whole drug crisis, 
has led to the fentanyl crisis, has touched all of us. All of 
us that live in Indian Country, we all have family members it 
has touched very close. Most of us could probably say we have 
family members who have been locked up because of use of drugs 
or they got cut up worse.
    So it is very personal to me. I was happy to work with the 
Trump Administration on trying to address this. I thought we 
went a pretty good way on actually just identifying some of the 
issues. In fact, in front of me I have a very detailed 30-page 
report to Congress from BIA on the Opioid Reduction Task Force 
that was put in in 2018 and 2019. These are two detailed pages 
right here. I would like to submit it for the record if that is 
okay, Chairman.
    The Chairman. Hearing no objection, so ordered. *
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * The information referred to has been retained in the Committee 
files.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Senator Mullin. And I will tell you that I haven't heard 
anything, and this is no backhand, because Indian Country is 
bigger than politics. It is not a Republican thing; it is not a 
Democrat thing. In fact, most of us just say just get the heck 
out of our way, let us live our lives. That is what we have 
always wanted to do.
    But I haven't heard anything from this Administration. Not 
a word. And I helped with this task force. I helped bring some 
reality to it. I brought a different law enforcement to the 
Cherokee Marshalls or Light Horse or whatever task force it was 
to deal directly with them. I am at a loss.
    So I have a couple questions for you. One of them is 
really, who is running the Opioid Task Force for OGS right now? 
OJS, I guess.
    Mr. Melville. Thank you, Senator. Right now the Opioid Task 
Force really hasn't been, so it hasn't been followed up on as 
much as it should have.
    Senator Mullin. And that is a problem. It is a huge 
problem. This isn't politics. This is about our families. I 
have to ask almost every tribal member out here, how many of 
you all know grandparents who are raising the third generation 
of their kids? Not their grandkids, their great grandkids now. 
Because two generations have been lost. I see heads bobbing 
everywhere.
    Let me bob my head. I have three adopted children right now 
because of drugs that came from ICWA, Cherokee tribal members. 
We have an Administration that says they are for Indian 
Country, but this task force was put in place and it was being 
pretty danged effective, and no one is heading it up now? How 
are you going after fentanyl if you are not going after 
opioids? They are a heck of a lot easier to get your hands on. 
And it is the foundation. Does anybody argue that point? It is 
the foundation to these drugs.
    Because the opioid is where the accidental overdose took 
place. It is where they accidentally got addicted. It is 
because they were prescribed by IHS doctors after surgery or 
back pain or any injury, and they took it according to the 
doctor's recommendations. And yet we all know after seven to 
ten days 30 percent of the population is going to be dependent 
on it.
    And if they quit getting that, they go on to fentanyl. You 
don't have a task force for it anymore? There is a problem.
    Have we seen any arrests from OJS? Do we know what the 
arrests are for, underneath the arrests for seizures on the 
southwest border since 2018 and 2019? Do we know how many 
people have been arrested or drugs been seized?
    Mr. Melville. Sir, I don't have the numbers in front of me 
about who has been arrested. But we have done an amazing job 
this year under this Administration working on prosecution, not 
only just catching people who are coming across with drugs but 
also --
    Senator Mullin. I will switch that question.
    Ma'am, how many have been switched to and been convicted 
now?
    Ms. Waldref. I don't have the data in front of me.
    Senator Mullin. Can we get that data?
    Ms. Waldref. We can absolutely provide information 
regarding --
    Senator Mullin. Because I can get pretty close to it with 
what is happening in our Country, most of them are going 
unprosecuted. The arrests are being, they are being arrested, 
but they are not being prosecuted. In fact, when you deal with 
the FBI, the FBI says, listen, we are just trying to deal with 
the most heinous crimes in Indian Country right now. Is that 
different than what you are hearing? No? Good. Say it out loud 
for the record so I can hear that.
    Mr. Melville. No.
    Senator Mullin. No. So we are not even prosecurting these 
individuals. That is a problem. That is a huge, huge problem. 
So we are up here and we are talking about fentanyl, we are 
talking about the opioid crisis, and we are doing nothing for 
it. This is all dog and pony show. Because I am living in it. 
And it is worse now than it has been.
    This is not, guys, for my Democrat colleagues, this isn't 
about politics to me. I could care less, because this is my 
back yard. This is my home. This is my family. It has nothing 
to do with Republicans, nothing to do with Democrats, this has 
to do with getting the drugs off our streets.
    And you can't seize it and think it is not going to come 
back if you don't prosecute. If you don't get the vendors, I am 
not talking about the users, I am talking about the dealers, if 
you don't get them off our streets, what good does it do? In 
fact, it just breeds more dealers, because they know they won't 
be prosecuted.
    It is a hole, and we need help with it. I am just trying to 
help, sir, I know I am over my time, I am just trying to help 
open peoples' eyes, because maybe you don't see it because you 
don't live it. That is why I am saying I do. And I am willing 
to work with anybody on this, including this Administration, to 
just help get these--ma'am, I know you want to do your job. I 
know you do. So this isn't on you. And sir, I know you do, too.
    Help us help you. What do we need to do? I yield back.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much. Senator Cortez Masto?

           STATEMENT OF HON. CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Cortez Masto. Well, let me follow that. Because I 
absolutely agree with you.
    Here is what I know. Nevada is 110,000 square miles. There 
are 3 million people who live there, 28 tribal communities. I 
know, working there in law enforcement, that the Mexican 
cartels use the distance of vast deserts and areas to peddle 
their drugs. And they can get into some of our tribal 
communities.
    I also know, of the 28 tribal communities, not all of them 
have law enforcement. They rely on BIA.
    My challenge is with BIA, and this is what I want to hear, 
is if they are under-resourced and understaffed. In Nevada, the 
BIA comes from three different regions. Just recently, I was 
with the Fort McDermott Paiute Shoshone Tribe, which is on the 
border of Nevada and Oregon, talking with the tribe and the BIA 
agents. There are not enough of them to cover that territory, 
those vast distances, and the other territory that they have to 
cover if they are coming from Arizona or California or wherever 
they are coming from.
    I also will tell you that every U.S. Attorney's office, and 
I thank you for being here, but everyone is going to be unique 
and different. Some are very aggressive when it comes to 
staffing AUSAs on tribal communities and working it with the 
FBI who are assigned to it to go after the crime, and some are 
not. That is part of the problem.
    So my first question to Mr. Melville is, be honest with us, 
tell us if you need more BIA agents, and what do you need to 
staff those BIA agents? And is that enough?
    I will add one final thing here. I just got off the phone 
this past week, we lost two police officers, NHP police 
officers in southern Nevada. We have a funeral tomorrow. I was 
talking with the head of our DPS. He literally wants to enter 
into an agreement with some of our tribes to be able to provide 
investigation and law enforcement. But BIA and Interior are 
blocking that.
    So what is the answer here? If we can't have BIA be honest 
with us and tell us the resources you need to cover the 
territory, have our AUSAs, U.S. Attorneys, our FBI agents, by 
the way, who are not tasked, enough resources to go after a lot 
of the drugs we see and the activity that happens here, what do 
we do? And what do the tribes do?
    We also know that tribes, most of the crime is by non-
Indians. How do we handle that?
    We are all asking for answers. That is why I have the 
BADGES Act, that is why the Parity Act is here, that is why 
there is a lot of work trying to get at how do we staff this 
and address the challenges, the complexity of it. But I have 
always wanted BIA to be here, and I am asking you, what do we 
need to do? You are understaffed. Tell us why. What is going 
on, and what else do you need?
    Mr. Melville. Thank you, ma'am. I will be honest with you. 
The issue of lacking law enforcement in Indian Country is a 
lack of interest in being in law enforcement by qualified 
Indians who don't really want to go into law enforcement, don't 
really want to be part of that anymore.
    We are actively working with youth to try to bring in some 
interest, to understand that law enforcement is not a bad 
career, that it is a place where you can serve your people and 
serve your country.
    Senator Cortez Masto. So are you telling me that you have 
open positions for BIA agents and you can't fill those 
positions?
    Mr. Melville. That is correct.
    Senator Cortez Masto. And the reason why you can't fill 
those positions is because of a lack of interest, or because 
the salary, the retention, the benefits are not enough?
    Mr. Melville. We are working on the salary and benefits. We 
are working on the pay parity for our law enforcement officers. 
Our police officers, when I took over, were GS-083s. They 
stepped out at GS-8. We have now moved them into the 1801 
series of law enforcement officer, professionalized them to 
department standards, along with every other bureau, or most 
every other bureau, in the Department of Interior. Now they 
have gone to GS-11 wages. So that is living wages for our 
police officers. That is for OJS direct service.
    Senator Cortez Masto. In the meantime, you are trying to 
retain more officers to cover the territory that you need. Even 
at the capacity that you have, do you need more officers, 
number one? And two, are you opposed to entering into 
agreements with local law enfocemenet, State law enforcement, 
to help cover the territory when tribes don't have tribal law 
enforcement?
    Mr. Melville. Absolutely not, ma'am. I want Indian Country 
to be as safe as possible. I want departments, tribal, local, 
Federal, everybody, to be able to work together in cooperative 
agreements, mutual aid agreements, whatever. It doesn't matter. 
If somebody needs police assistance, I don't want anybody to 
think, okay, what badge or what color uniform is coming to help 
me? All I am getting is police service when I need it.
    Senator Cortez Masto. I know my time is up, and thank you. 
We are going to follow up. I want answers to all this, so we 
are providing the resources we need.
    But let me ask Ms. Waldref, thank you for being here, how 
many AUSAs do you have assigned to tribal communities?
    Ms. Waldref. My office has 40 AUSA positions, and I would 
say probably half of our AUSAs are doing work that impacts our 
tribal nations.
    Senator Cortez Masto. What does that mean? They are 
actually prosecuting cases?
    Ms. Waldref. Yes. We have prosectuors, we have a dedicated 
Indian Country liaison who is on the ground, talking with all 
of our tribal nations.
    Actualy, I am very excited to be having one of the MMIP 
AUSAs who is going to be hired in eastern Washington joining 
our team as well, serving the entire western region to 
collaborate and provide better resources for --
    Senator Cortez Masto. And how many FBI agents are working 
with you for tribal communities?
    Ms. Waldref. For our entire region, we have two SSRAs and I 
would say it is about nine to ten FBI agents serving our tribal 
communities in eastern Washington.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. I know I am done and I am 
going to run over time.
    But not every ASUA, not every U.S. Attorney's office 
devotes that entire, what you have done to tribal communities. 
Every one is unique, and some are missing out on providing that 
type of enforcement and prosecution. That is part of the 
challenge we see. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Hoeven?

                STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN HOEVEN, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA

    Senator Hoeven. Thanks, Mr. Chair, and thanks for holding 
the meeting today.
    I want to fololow up on what Senator Cortez Masto was 
talking about here. Last month, we had Chairman Jamie Azure of 
the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians testify in front 
of this Committee. He said that there is one, and this is going 
to be for you, Mr. Melville, one BIA drug agent stationed to 
patrol all of our reservations in North Dakota. We have five 
reservations spread out over thousands of miles, two of which 
we share with South Dakota. Turtle Mountain actually is up on 
the Canadian border.
    So to address this, the North Dakota legislature authorized 
additional North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation agents 
to work with and near tribal communities. So last year, Spirit 
Lake entered into an MOU with the State of North Dakota 
agreeing to share resources and information pertaining to law 
enforcement operations.
    My question is, why has the department taken over three 
years to review an MOU between the Turtle Mountain Tribe and 
the State of North Dakota to address law enforcement and public 
safety issues on the Turtle Mountain Reservation, when we have 
that shortage of BIA agents? Why would you delay that for three 
years?
    Mr. Melville. Thank you for the question, Senator. I will 
let you know that the agreements have been reviewed by our 
solicitor's office, and that tends to, when you have solicitors 
get involved, it takes a little bit longer. I guarantee that we 
have our folks on the ground trying to work together, no matter 
what, if they have an MOU or not.
    Senator Hoeven. Do you think that is acceptable, three 
years?
    Mr. Melville. No, absolutely not.
    Senator Hoeven. That is just our experience. There are more 
than 700 reservations around the Country. Will you commit to me 
that you are going to do something about this?
    Mr. Melville. Absolutely.
    Senator Hoeven. Okay. Along those lines, we have set up a 
law enforcement training center for FBI agents at Camp Grafton, 
which is our National Guard site in North Dakota. I think 
something like 50 percent of the jobs in the upper Great Plains 
for BIA law enforcement officers are vacant, places like 
Montana, Alaska, North Dakota.
    The whole idea is because they formerly all had to go down 
to New Mexico for training. A lot of the folks from the 
northern tribes or reservations didn't want to do that. They 
wanted to stay closer to home. That is why we set up this 
center.
    So what can you do to help us continue to recruit and get 
more of these BIA law enforcement candidates to our training 
center? Actually, the reality is, I think we are already 
running over capacity. So it is really, what can you do to help 
us continue to staff up and resource it to handle more of these 
agents when we need so many of them across all of our northern 
plains reservations?
    Mr. Melville. What can we do? We can always be looking for 
additional positions, so that we are constantly recruiting, we 
are reaching out to the tribal colleges. We have even started 
working with high-school age kids.
    Senator Hoeven. I think the biggest thing is, to help us 
resource it, we already have more applicants than we can 
handle. These are folks who will fill these northern plains BIA 
law enforcement positions. So we need your help.
    Mr. Melville. I think under the BADGES Act we have a 
proposal that the Bureau of Indian Affairs would be able to do 
their own background investigations, which would speed up the 
hiring and getting boots on the ground a whole lot quicker.
    Senator Hoeven. What I am looking for is help getting them 
to and through the academy, resources there. Are you willing to 
work with my staff on that?
    Mr. Melville. Absolutely.
    Senator Hoeven. Okay. And then I want to ask about the 
commitments and border, for Mr. Cohen. Why aren't we doing more 
to stop the influx of fentanyl across the border, as well as 
just the flow of people across the border, and the flow of 
drugs, not only to every community in this Country, but to 
every reservation? What do you think ought to be done, or do 
you think it is acceptable, what is going on right?
    Mr. Cohen. Senator, we have record numbers of personnel on 
the border. Something like 85 percent of CBP is facing south. 
That is actually paying off. The teams at CBP are making record 
seizures of illicit narcotics coming across the border, some 
547,000 pounds of illicit narcotics last year. Of that, 28,000 
pounds was illicit fentanyl. So we are making sort of an 
historic commitment there, and we are seeing some historic 
return.
    Senator Hoeven. Should the metric be how much you seize, or 
how many more people come here illegally and how much more 
drugs come here illegally? So if you are seizing more all the 
time and there are more and more coming into our communities, 
do you consider that success?
    Mr. Cohen. The metric for me is reducing overdose death. 
That is the north star for me, that is the north star for the 
President, for this Administration.
    Senator Hoeven. It isn't reducing the amount of drugs that 
actually flow into the Country?
    Mr. Cohen. The metric is trying to reduce, from 110,000 
Americans that passed away last year due to drug poisoning, 70 
percent of which was due to fentanyl poisoning, is to try to 
get that number down as much as possible.
    Senator Hoeven. How are we doing on that?
    Mr. Cohen. The fact is that we are now seeing a level-off 
in that overdose rate after three-plus years of increases up 
through calendar year 2021. We have now seen a leveling off. 
That gives us a chance to find a plateau. I am hopeful that 
that plateau gives us decrease. We won't know unless we 
continue to fololow our historic ivnestments with more 
investment.
    Senator Hoeven. Final follow-up, Mr. Chairman.
    So you feel that the flow of drugs and people, including 
drug dealers coming across the border now, you feel you are 
making progress on that? Is that what you are telling us?
    Mr. Cohen. I am focused on the amount of narcotics coming 
into the United States and the illicit fentanyl coming into the 
United States, and trying to seize as much of that as I can. 
Every ounce, every pound, every package of fentanyl that we 
seize along the border is not getting to Americans that are 
ultimately overdosing.
    So that is progress to me.
    The Chairman. Senator Smith?

                 STATEMENT OF HON. TINA SMITH, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Smith. Thank you, Chair Schatz, and Ranking Member 
Murkowski.
    I can tell from this conversation that people feel really 
strongly about this. We feel strongly about it because we know 
that it is such a huge issue in our States. I can't remember a 
time that we have held two hearings so close to one another 
like this. I think it underscores the importance of this.
    I can tell you that I hear from tribal leaders in Minnesota 
all the time about the devastation of the fentanyl crisis, for 
every single family. Just as Senator Mullin said, it touches 
everybody in one way or another.
    Just last week, I heard a story about a situation at 
Sisseton Wahpeton in South Dakota, just across the border from 
Minnesota. Just terrible violence that was driven by drug 
trafficking.
    I also want to say, Mr. Chair, to note our Minnesota 
experience, while there is a huge problem with figuring out how 
to do prosecutions for these crimes, there are some examples 
where there has been some success. This has been a story that I 
have heard over and over again from Red Lake Nation, for 
example, the sort of revolving door that happens with non-
Native people coming onto tribal land, committing crimes, drug 
crimes, sex trafficking crimes, and then just basically walking 
away.
    An example of what we are doing that I think is working is 
the U.S. Attorney in Minnesota, Andy Luger, went up to Red 
Lake, understood what was going on. As a result of that and 
their consultation with Red Lake, they were able to hire five 
special prosecutors for Indian Country in Minnesota, with new 
resources from the Biden Administration to be able to get at 
that prosecution. So it is not a panacea, but it is helping to 
be able to make an improvement.
    What I want to focus on is this question of how, on the 
other hand, if tribes have special tribal criminal 
jurisdiction, that they are able to prosecute these crimes in 
ways that will also make a big difference.
    Deputy Director Melville, I know that the special tribal 
criminal jurisdiction goes through the DOJ. I would like to ask 
you about the lessons you have learned from that program that 
we could apply up here. I have worked on this, with many on 
this Committee, particularly with the VAWA reauthorization.
    So what can you tell us about the impact of that special 
tribal criminal jurisdiction on the missing and murdered 
indigenous people issue, and what can we learn from that that 
might guide us as we try to get more progress in this area?
    Mr. Melville. Thank you, ma'am. I can tell you that any 
time that the tribes get special authorization or special 
jurisdiction that they take care of it, they go after it 
incredibly hard. Because they had had taken away that 
jurisdiction from before.
    They finally are at a point where they can do something 
themselves, that they can see the product of what they are 
putting forward. That really empowers them. They are very 
emotional about what they have going on. By giving them that 
additional jurisdiction that was taken away under Public Law 
280 or Oliphant, all of a sudden that gives the tribes buy-in. 
They absolutely are taking care of it.
    It helps quite a bit.
    Senator Smith. So, some lessons that we have learned for 
providing special criminal jurisdiction on missing and murdered 
indigenous people, we could think about applying that to create 
a drug crime special jurisdiction that could have some of the 
same positive results, you think?
    Mr. Melville. Absolutely.
    Senator Smith. Thank you.
    Director Tso, I wanted to ask you, when you were first 
nominated, we discussed my hope to create a special behavioral 
health program in Indian Country, modeled on the successful 
Special Diabetes Program. What we were talking about, there is 
a great interplay, of course, between behavioral health issues 
and substance use disorder issues.
    I am wondering if you could comment briefly on how you 
think a special behavioral health program could help address 
the fentanyl crisis in Indian Country.
    Ms. Tso. Thank you, Senator, for that question.
    Two things I would say. One is that of course, building on 
the Special Diabetes Program, really incorporating, and the 
foundation of that was built in Indian Country. Each community 
was able to build what they needed for their communities. It is 
the same place that we need to start for behavioral health. 
That is where we are right now with behavioral health.
    The tribal leaders, tribal communities, are taking control 
of what it is that they need for their specific communities. I 
see that Indian Health Service or the Federal Government 
becomes a support. We are technical advisors at some point, and 
we are no longer and should not be driving what is appropriate 
for Indian Country. This has been something we are working on.
    So as we are looking more at strategies, building 
strategies that we can offer partnering with people like the 
Portland Area Indian Health Board and other national 
organizations to help us build strategies, that can be 
incorporated at the local level to best address this. It has to 
be following the same model as SDPI.
    Senator Smith. Thank you very much. That is very good 
guidance for us. I appreciate it.
    The Chairman. Senator Daines.

                STATEMENT OF HON. STEVE DAINES, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Senator Daines. Chairman Schatz, thank you, as well as Vice 
Chair Murkowski.
    This Committee recently heard first-hand from tribal 
leaders about the devastating consequences of fentanyl, 
fentanyl flowing into Indian Country, which I think in many 
ways is ground zero for the overall fentanyl crisis in our 
Nation. In fact, we heard a simple message from Councilman 
Bryce Kirk, who was here from the Fort Peck Reservation in 
Montana. To paraphrase what he said, he said we need to shut 
down the southern border, that is what he said, to stop these 
dangerous drugs from entering our Country.
    There must be real policy changes to make the border more 
secure. It is all tied together. Until we do that, I am very 
concerned that lives will continue to be lost, communities will 
continue to be destroyed, law enforcement overwhelmed by 
fentanyl and other drugs that are being brought to the United 
Sttes.
    When I spend time out in our resevations on Montana and 
talk to law enforcement, talk to tribal leaders, they will tell 
you from the time that fentanyl crosses the Rio Grande until it 
gets to a reservation in Montana is 48 to 72 hours.
    In Montana, Native Americans are dying from overdoses at a 
two to one ratio. Montana law enforcement broke last year's 
record of fentanyl seizures in just the first six months of 
this year. It continues to climb. It is not a mystery where 
these drugs are coming from; they are coming across the wide-
open southern border.
    Deputy Director Cohen, the Biden Administration's National 
Drug Control Strategy promised bold action to combat the 
fentanyl crisis. The Office of National Drug Control Policy 
cites a mandate from the President to stop drug trafficking 
organizations that bring fentanyl into our Country.
    My question is, do you think the Administration is doing 
enough to stop the flow of illegal drugs across the southern 
border?
    Mr. Cohen. Senator, I share your concerns. The fact that 
overdose rates are as high as they are in the indigenous 
communities is difficult.
    As I mentioned a moment ago, in response to Senator 
Hoeven's question, the fact that overdose deaths continue to 
rise in that community is the north star. There is a historic 
commitment by this Administration. I appreciate that there is 
that difficulty. But the fact is that we have put record 
amounts of resources into the southwest border. We are seizing 
record amounts of narcotics as it is coming across the border.
    One of the reasons that I urge this Committee to pass the 
supplemental is that I need to continue to keep my foot on the 
gas to continue to seize----
    Senator Daines. Have you been down on the southern border 
before?
    Mr. Cohen. Yes, sir.
    Senator Daines. Have you talked to Border Patrol?
    Mr. Cohen. Yes, sir.
    Senator Daines. Did you ask them about what they tihnik 
about the resources directed there, they have apprehended over 
8 million illegals coming across the border, how that somehow 
is part of the calculus in terms of stretched capabilities? Why 
Border Patrol agents now are starting to retire at record 
levels, because they were hired to protect the border, not 
process illegals? Have you had those conversations with them?
    Mr. Cohen. The focus of my conversations with CBP rank and 
file as well as leadership is all about doing everything that 
this Administration can possibly do to reduce the flow of 
narcotics.
    Senator Daines. Do you think it distracts the Border 
Patrol's mission of trying to stop illegal drugs by having to 
process some now 8 million illegals plus 1.6 million known 
gotaways since the President took office?
    Mr. Cohen. I am hesitant to conflate border security, 
immigration policy, and narcotics trafficking.
    Senator Daines. This is not immigration policy. This is 
about an out of control southern border that is wide open. Do 
you think the Administration is doing enough?
    Mr. Cohen. I think that with our historic investments and 
with the focus on narcotics trafficking, the fact that we are 
seizing as much as we are seizing as much as we are seizing is 
saving American lives. That is the metric.
    Senator Daines. I understand and with respect to your 
opinion, it is certainly somebody out there trying to help. But 
I wouldn't trade you jobs right now. But I think that is the 
wrong metric to look at, because we have absolutely a flood, it 
is like saying, if you started measuring how many illegals they 
have apprehended at the border and say, we are proud of the 
fact that we seized 8 million since the current President took 
office, that is not a record to be proud of.
    So I will move on. Director Tso, it is my understanding 
that the relationship between your office at IHS and the 
Blackfeet Tribe has deteriorated to the point that the 
Blackfeet leadership has called for new leadership. The 
government-to-government relationship between IHS and the 
Blackfeet is broken.
    I am not seeing actions being taken to resolve the issue. 
There is a lack of doctors to treat basic medical concerns, 
provide resources necessary. The issue of certainly the harm 
done by Dr. Stanley Weber on the reservation, IHS has failed 
the Blackfeet Nation.
    Do you believe the IHS is doing enough for the Blackfeet 
people to fulfill its trust responsibility?
    Ms. Tso. Thank you, Senator, for that question. Of course, 
every relationship with tribal leaders is absolutely important 
for the work that I do at the Indian Health Service. I cannot 
do my job without working very closely with all tribes, 
including the Blackfeet Tribe.
    Senator Daines. Have you been to the Blackfeet Reservation 
in your capacity as Director? As Director?
    Ms. Tso. No. I was planning to go there, and we did not 
make it there. I will continue to, and I have continued to have 
conversations and outreach to the tribe to make sure that we 
continue dialogue and conversations about the health care 
services in their community.
    Senator Daines. On behalf of the Blackfeet Tribe, I would 
request that you would make that trip. Meet with the tribal 
leaders, meet with the people there on the reservation, hear it 
first-hand. Because I am hearing it. You should be able to make 
the same trip out to Montana to hear from them.
    Ms. Tso. I have been out to Montana about four times. I 
will continue to do outreach with them.
    Senator Daines. As Director, though, the position you have 
now. Please go see the Blackfeet.
    Ms. Tso. Yes, sir.
    Senator Daines. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Tester?

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Senator Tester. I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman and 
Ranking Member, for having this hearing. The questions that 
have been asked here so far got me thinking of the first time I 
came to an Indian Affairs meeting; it was when Byron Dorgan was 
Chairman and Craig Thomas was Ranking Member.
    One of the issues we were talking about was declination in 
Indian Country, and why there was such a high rate of 
declination. Because quite frankly, it is a problem and it has 
been a problem, and I am not going to get political here, so I 
am not going to talk about what a wonderful job Trump has done 
or what a wonderful job Biden has done. The truth is, this has 
been a train wreck for a long time, through multiple 
administrations, through multiple, regardless of which party 
has been in the White House.
    U.S. Attorney, why has this been the case, and why does it 
continue to be the case? Are there any shining stars where we 
are actually seeing cases being prosecuted at the same rate as 
off-reservation cases?
    Ms. Waldref. The department is committed to achieving 
public safety in Native American communities. I think one 
example that I can highlight as a success was actually a cross-
jurisdictional effort between my office and the Montana U.S. 
Attorney's office, where we were able to share information very 
effectively with partnerships between DEA, BIA, and our tribal 
law enforcement partners to seize 160,000 fentanyl pills before 
they entered the Colville Reservation and made their way over 
into the Montana areas as well.
    Senator Tester. Let me ask you, why is it this way? I know 
we only have one FBI officer in Montana. Sounds like you only 
have one FBI officer in North Dakota. Why is it that the 
declinations are so high? I don't want to throw the BIA under 
the bus, because you guys need more people. There is no doubt 
about it.
    In fact, I had a tribe in earlier this week, and I had a 
tribe that I talked to on the phone right before Thanksgiving. 
We have a minimum number of BIA agents and 638 tribes are in 
the same boat, they don't have enough folks. If you don't have 
law enforcement, you can't put down the paper trail, and you 
can't have a good case to be able to get these folks convicted.
    Let's cut right to the chase. Is that the problem?
    Ms. Waldref. Thank you, Senator. You have identified the 
challenges of law enforcement in bringing cases that can be 
prosecutable to the United States Attorneys offices. The 
challenges we have with recruitment and retention on both 
tribal reservations with 638 contracts or in the BIA, the 
department is trying to do all it can to fill those 
jurisdictional gaps and fill those law enforcement gaps.
    Senator Tester. I got you. But a lot of this falls on us, 
making sure that the BIA has the resources it needs to be 
competitive. This is not pointed at you in any way whatsoever, 
Mr. Melville. I am just asking a question.
    How do your wages and benefits compare with the highway 
patrol?
    Mr. Melville. Thank you, Senator. They are getting better.
    Senator Tester. But they are not close to them, are they?
    Mr. Melville. They are getting better.
    Senator Tester. Okay, so when you get an agent trained up, 
a BIA agent, you know what they are going to look at going to? 
They are going to go to Customs and Border Protection, or they 
are going to go to the county, or they are going to go to the 
highway patrol. This isn't your fault. This is our fault. The 
folks on this side of the rostra.
    And it is not these folks who are the problem, either, 
because every one of us understands that we have to have money 
in the budget for the BIA to hire officers. If they don't have 
the budget, and by the way, also in the budget for when a tribe 
638s, that they are getting the same amount of money as you 
guys have to do the same kind of job.
    So it is on us. Let me give you a perspective on that. I 
don't want to throw us all the way under the bus, but you can 
throw us part of the way.
    Mr. Melville?
    Mr. Melville. You are exactly right, Senator, absolutely 
right. Being able to compete with the other departments out 
there, there is a shortage of law enforcement nationwide. When 
you have city police departments that are offering a $25,000 
hiring bonus just for somebody who has law enforcement 
experience, of course, somebody that is going from a tribe or 
even the Bureau of Indian Affairs at one point would be tempted 
to go and get that money.
    Senator Tester. And you combine that with a lack of 
housing, with schools that need attention in Indian Country, 
and why are you going to be able to out-recruit anybody, is the 
point? So we have a lot of work to do.
    Just one thing for the record that I want to put forth, the 
fentanyl that is coming into this Country, some of it is coming 
in between the border stations. But the vast majority is coming 
through the border stations. We need technology. We have 
technology, by the way, that can determine that stuff if it is 
in a car or a truck or in a hubcap or whatever it might be. We 
need to get serious about doing technology and manpower to 
secure the southern border.
    But if we really want to do this, we have to quit making it 
a political talking point and get after it, both sides. Thank 
you.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Tester.
    Senator Lujan?

               STATEMENT OF HON. BEN RAY LUJAN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO

    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to 
our Vice Chair as well for this hearing.
    Mr. Melville, as the hearing began, I had the honor of 
handing a letter over to your staff which I believe has since 
been shared with you. It is a letter from Mescalero Apache 
Nation in New Mexico dated August 30th. They still haven't had 
a response to this letter and previous letters related to this.
    Mr. Melville, I was hoping that I can maybe get a timeframe 
when the agency might be able to get the tribe a response to 
that letter.
    Mr. Melville. Thank you, Senator. Absolutely. Since we have 
received the letter from the tribe, we have been working very, 
very closely with them, sending folks in to take a look at the 
programs, seeing what they can do, having more communication 
with the tribe.
    The fact that a formal letter hasn't gone back to them is 
something I will need to follow up on.
    Senator Lujan. Is that something we can work on and get a 
formal response to the tribe?
    Mr. Melville. Absolutely, Senator.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that, Mr. Melville.
    In New Mexico, thousands of tribal members fell victim to 
an extensive Sober Home Medicaid fraud scheme in Arizona. Many 
were kidnapped from New Mexico and driven hundreds of miles to 
Arizona under the false promise of treatment. Then they were 
left there without any means to get home or any treatment 
whatsoever. The tragedy highlighted the dire need for increases 
in substance use disorder treatment.
    Mr. Cohen, I appreciated in your testimony that you said, 
``If it is easiser to get drugs than it is to get treatment, we 
will never redcuce overdose deaths.'' I appreciate that.
    Ms. Tso, how is IHS increasing access to substance use 
disorder treatment so that people do not fall prey to these 
horrible frauds? I will include that what I would add to Mr. 
Cohen's statement is also for alcohol related deaths as well. 
But my question to Ms. Tso is, what is IHS doing to increase 
access to substance use disorder treatment, so that people 
don't fall prey to these horrible frauds?
    Ms. Tso. Thank you, Senator. This continues, of course, to 
be a challenge across the Country, to find places where our 
people can go, specifically our people from Indian Country. We 
do continue to work across the agency to find places where we 
can support our people to go.
    But much of this also takes integrating into the community 
level strategies that we can use to again, help tribes use what 
is working in their communities to build before we can, if 
there is any delay to get them into treatment. So we are 
looking at strategies and trying to find ways to do this.
    Senator Lujan. The IHS Community Opioid Intervention pilot 
project awarded 35 grants in 2021, a little over $16 million in 
funding appropriated by Congress, including one to the 
Albuquerque Area Indian Health Board of New Mexico. But no new 
awards are available due to lack of funding.
    Ms. Tso, yes or no, should Cognress provide additional 
funding for this pilot grant program?
    Ms. Tso. Yes.
    Senator Lujan. Ms. Tso, yes or no, does the IHS support 
permanent authorization of this program?
    Ms. Tso. Yes.
    Senator Lujan. And Ms. Tso, what would be the impact of 
IHS' treatment work if Congress does not pass a domestic 
supplement with funding to combat the fentanyl crisis?
    Ms. Tso. Thank you, Senator. We are already behind, as all 
of us are talking about here, with regard to strategies to get 
in front of the opioid crisis. Failing to fund the supplemental 
will continue to put us further behind.
    Senator Lujan. Ms. Waldref, in your testimony you mentioned 
that earlier this year one of the largest ever seizures of 
narcotics in your district included thousands of rainbow-
colored fentanyl tablets. The Senator showed us a large photo 
of just one of those bags.
    You allege that a significant portion of the drugs were 
destined for the Colville Reservation and other Native American 
communities and surrounding areas. My question is, why are 
cartel operatives using tribal lands to transport and hide 
fentanyl?
    Ms. Waldref. Thank you, Senator. The challenges that rural 
communities are facing for addressing the crisis of fentanyl 
are serious. We do see drug trafficking operations using rural 
communities as areas to stash drugs.
    The DEA is engaged in all efforts to ensure that our large 
drug trafficking organizations are being held accountable for 
the fentanyl that they are bringing into our communities. There 
is information sharing that we absolutely encourage between our 
tribal law enforcement, our FBI and our DEA to ensure that we 
are gathering appropriate information to not allow those drug 
traffickers to use any of our communities, particularly our 
tribal communities, as safe areas. It should not be. There are 
Federal prosecution priorities around ensuring that these drug 
traffickers are being held accountable for that work.
    Senator Lujan. Ms. Waldref, in your testimony, you endorsed 
a multi-faceted strategy to address the fentanyl crisis in 
Indian Country. Does the multi-faceted strategy include 
proactive steps that DOJ will take to address the crisis on 
missing and murdered indigenous people?
    Ms. Waldref. Absolutely, Senator. The dangers that we are 
seeing in our communities that are related to drug trafficking 
has so much crossover with violent crimes, including the root 
causes of missing and murdered indigenous people. Our efforts 
to prosecute both drug crimes and domestic violence, violent 
crimes, assaults, are all efforts to address the missing and 
murdered ingeneous people crisis.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    We thank all of our testifiers. If there are no more 
questions for our witnesses, members may also submit follow-up 
questions for the record. The hearing record will be open for 
two weeks.
    I want to thank all of you for your time, your testimony 
and your hard work.
    This hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 4:02 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

                            A P P E N D I X

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Marvin Weatherwax, Chairman, Coalition of 
        Large Tribes; Member, Blackfeet Tribal Business Council
    My name is Marvin Weatherwax, Jr., and on behalf of the Coalition 
of Large Tribes, I thank you for holding this important oversight 
hearing on ``Fentanyl In Native Communities: Federal Perspectives On 
Addressing The Growing Crisis.'' The Coalition of Large Tribes is an 
intertribal Section 17 corporation representing the interests of the 
more than 50 tribes with reservations of 100,000 acres or more. 
Fentanyl is a crisis on many COLT Member Tribes' reservations. The 
testimony of President Frank Star Comes Out represents our typical 
experience on our large land base reservations.
    Cartels are omni-present on our reservations, something about which 
I speak out often. See, e.g., Tribal Leaders Warn Biden's Menthol Ban 
Will Only Further Empower Cartels National Review (``The cartels have a 
`big presence' in his community, where tribal police don't have 
authority over nonmembers. They pretty much feel unmatchable; they're 
just brazen, out in the open. It's almost like it's raining fentanyl on 
our community'').
    The cartels are empowered by tribes' lack of criminal jurisdiction 
over non-Indians. Cartels know they can get away with anything--that 
little to no law enforcement presence is available and prosecution is 
exceedingly unlikely even if they are arrested because of federal 
declination rates. Congress has known this for decades. Indeed, a 
generation after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Oliphant v. 
Suquamish Tribe, finding that tribes had been implicitly divested of 
criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians because of tribes' status as 
``conquered peoples,'' then-United States Senator Ben Nighthorse 
Campbell questioned the impact of Oliphant and observed that ``the word 
is out that people can get off the hook, so to speak, if they are not 
Indian and they do something on Indian land.'' S. Hrg. 107-605.
    COLT and other tribal organizations have long proposed solutions to 
address this. See Oversight Hearing ``Opportunities and Challenges for 
Improving Public Safety in Tribal Communities'' Coalition of Large 
Tribes; COLT-Resolution-04-2022.pdf (largetribes.org); SAC-22-043-
FINAL-SIGNED-WITH-ATTACHMENT.pdf (largetribes.org). *

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Tribal law enforcement is also critically underfunded. COLT Member 
Tribes often have only one or two officers per shift on duty to serve 
areas the size of Delaware or West Virginia. The vast distances, lack 
of broadband and cellular coverage, and jurisdictional gaps exacerbate 
the crisis.
    COLT has previously echoed the U.S. Senate concerns raised by 
Senators Cassidy, Rubio, Budd and Hagerty in their July letter to 
Commissioner Califf of the Food and Drug Administration, sounding the 
alarm over the Biden administration's plans to restrict tobacco 
products for Americans, potentially creating opportunities for foreign 
cartels to profit from illegal tobacco on the black market. Ranking 
Member Cassidy, Colleagues Sound. . .Senate Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor and Pensions; COLT Chairman Echoes Senate Alarm on 
Foreign Illicit Tobacco Threats Amid FDA Prohibitory Rulemakings on 
Menthol and Nicotine in Cigarettes Coalition of Large Tribes. COLT is 
very concerned about the illicit markets this rule will create and the 
pressure that will result on already-strained tribal law enforcement. 
This will be a cash cow for cartels already present on reservations and 
bombarding us with fentanyl and other drugs.
    As with other forms of prohibition, unregulated supply chains will 
take over once legal pathways to adult consumers are closed off. 
Banning the legal sale of menthol and nicotine-containing cigarettes 
will cede control of the market to illicit producers. Tribes are 
painfully aware from our experience with the fentanyl crisis that 
criminal interests in China, the Middle East and Mexico already use 
various channels to traffic drugs through and concentrate drugs on our 
reservations, where the jurisdictional maze and chronic underfunding of 
tribal law enforcement leaves a persistent gaps for public safety. 
COLT's June 2, 2023 Resolution #03-2022 (WR-Las Vegas), Calling for 
Pause in FDA Rulemaking on Tobacco to Allow for Tribal Consultation and 
Protecton of Tribal Ceremonial Uses and Public Safety addressed these 
concerns head on. COLT sent that Resolution to its Congressional 
delegations, the FDA and to the White House and has followed up in 
numerous meetings and communications since.
    Yet, the FDA is barreling ahead with this despite the strong and 
well-grounded opposition and even as media reports on the significant 
illicit/cartel markets that have sprung up in California immediately 
after their flavor ban. See, e.g., https://www.axios.com/2023/10/13/
illegal-vapes-thwart-fda-enforcement; https://sjvsun.com/california/
study-ban-hasnt-stopped-californians-from-using-flavored-tobacco-
menthols/. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Massachusetts' 2020 flavored tobacco ban is another good 
example of prohibition's expansion of illicit market. https://
www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2019/11/27/explainer-flavored-tobacco-vaping-
law. After the Massachusetts flavor ban went into effect adult 
consumers shifted their flavored tobacco purchases to neighboring 
states. The ban also fueled the already robust illegal market. Sharon 
man charged in connection with major illegal tobacco operation 
(bostonherald.com); Smuggled cigarettes continue to flow into 
Massachusetts (bostonherald.com); Ban on menthol cigarettes sends sales 
to black market, convenience store owners say (bostonherald.com).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The multi-billion-dollar product gaps created by the proposed rules 
will be filled by foreign criminal interests and directly and 
negatively impact public safety on remote rural Indian reservations 
like those of COLT Member Tribes. The California empty and discarded 
packs study showed the dominance of the ``Sheriff'' brand of menthol 
cigarettes which is a well-documented Mexican cartel brand, and that 
dominance emerged after just one year of California's flavor ban. If 
FDA's menthol rule were to go into effect, tribal law enforcement would 
need to be fully funded at $2.4 billion annually \2\ to try to address 
it. We are already out-manned and out-gunned and the proposed rules 
would provide the cartels with abundant cash as they fill the multi-
billion-dollar product gap.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ According the Bureau of Indian Affairs Office of Justice 
Services information presented in April 2023 to the Tribal Interior 
Budget Council, tribal law enforcement needs minimum annual funding of 
$2.9 billion. That number should be the floor. Presently, all of BIA, 
across many dozens of functions, is funded and $2.4 Billion. The 
underfunding is stark.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Why am I talking about menthol and fentanyl in the same testimony? 
Because if menthol is banned, the cartels will meet the demand and use 
the menthol illicit market as a cash cow utilizing their existing on-
reservation networks that work so well for them to rain fentanyl on us 
with impunity. The U.S Department of the Treasury recognizes that 
fentanyl is coming from Mexico and being financed with other illicit 
products. See U.S. Treasury Launches Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force U.S. 
Department of the Treasury; Remarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet 
L. Yellen on New Treasury Actions to Counter Illicit Financing Tied to 
Fentanyl in Mexico City, Mexico U.S. Department of the Treasury (``Just 
last week, and thanks to collaboration with Mexican government 
counterparts, OFAC designated three Mexican individuals and 13 Mexican 
entities linked to CJNG, which traffics a large portion of the illicit 
fentanyl and other deadly drugs that enter the United States. These 
individuals and entities had engaged, directly or indirectly, in 
timeshare fraud, in which elderly Americans can be robbed of their life 
savings. These funds are then used to fuel an expansive criminal 
enterprise''). Why the FDA would throw fuel on the raging fentanyl fire 
by banning menthol is unfathomable.
    To being to address the fentanyl issues, COLT recommends three 
things:

        1) Don't make it worse by inserting another product and more 
        cash into the cartels' arsenals by enacting the FDA menthol 
        bam. Abandon the menthol ban.

        2) Fully fund tribal law enforcement. By BIA-OJS' own 
        estimates, it would take $2.4 billion per year to fully fund 
        tribal law enforcement. All of BIA is funded at $2.9 billion. 
        We need to at least double that number because the mismatch is 
        absurd.

        3) Enact the public safety legislative proposal put forth by 
        COLT and endorsed by NCAI and virtually every other major 
        intertribal organization. Text attached. *

      Prepared Statement of Vincent Yazzie, Resident, Flagstaff AZ
    Dear Dr. Honorable Senators,
    My mom Annie Walker suffered a Right Middle Cerebral Artery Stroke 
on l/30/23 at home and ambulated to Flagstaff Medical Center(FMC) who 
gave her 2 doses ofTPA. Helocopter grounded by weather, so had to be 
driven to Phoenix, University Medical Center Banner. Stroke changed 
from blockage to bleeding. Helicopter crew was in Winslow, AZ and had 
to drive to Flagstaff to drive my mom down to Phoenix. A good one hour 
delay. After 2 weeks discharged to South Mountain Post Acute. After 2.5 
months, Medicare ran out and physical therapy plateaued due to 
spasticity pain. Discharged home. Flagstaff where she lives does not 
have a 24/7 Neurology Team, but TV Neurologist. She spent 5 months on 
Tylenol aka no treatment for level 10 pain. After 2 choking/seizure 
incidents she finally got some Baclofen to control spasticity. During 
this undertreatment she also got 3 doses of Fentynal on August 28, 
2023, September 3, 2023 and September 22, 2023 which caused more damage 
to her brain stem which was partially damaged on 1/30/23.
    Fentynal by IV by Flagstaff Medicial Center aggravated her damaged 
brain stem even more.
    TV neurologist Dr. Muhammad Munir, ``Try to limit the use of 
opiates and use alternative medicines for pain control. Consult pain 
management.'' but Fentynal was given on September 22, 2023 by Dr. Scott 
Lotz ``Post procedure management: Fentanyl, propofol, Ventilator 
settings as documented.''
    See attachment that Fentanyl is an opiod and can shrink blood 
vessels. With already damaged blood vessels to my moms' brain, Fentanyl 
would cause a stroke. *
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * The information referred to has been retained in the Committee 
files.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In the past morphine was used, but never heard of the use of 
fentynal for pain relief.
    In USA v. Jessica Joyce Spayd, Case No. 4:19-mj-00023-SAO, United 
States District Court for the District of Alaska, Criminal Complaint 
when death occurs as a result of Fentynal overdose that is a violation 
of 21 USC Paragraph 841(1)(1), (b)(l)(C) where fentanyl a highly-
addictive controlled substance has been distributed without a 
legitimate medical purpose. 21 CFR Paragraph 1306.04 sets forth the 
requirements for a valid prescription. It provides that for a 
``prescription for a controlled substance to be effective [it] must be 
issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner 
acting in the usual course of his professional practice. The 
responsibility for the proper prescribing and dispensing of controlled 
substances is upon the prescribing practitioner, but a corresponding 
responsibility rests with the pharmacist who fills the prescription.'' 
The DEA consulted with medical expert Dr. Timothy Munzing, MD'' set 
forth specific criteria to consider when determining if a physician 
acted within the scope of professional practice. According to Dr. 
Munzing, in a pain management practice, a physician must have:

        a. Adequately evaluated the patient and used good judgment in 
        developing a treatment plan;
        b. Physical exam--general plus detailed exam of painful area
        c. Practiced period clinical reviews
        d. Obtained or contemplated specialy consultation
        e. Kept and maintained complete and accurate medical records
        f. Developed a working diagnosis and maintained a differential 
        diagnosis
        g. Offered alternative therapies and approaches to treating the 
        disorder
        h. Reviewed previous medical records, diagnostic work-up, and 
        medical therapy
        i. Developed a plan of action for future diagnostic evaluation

    She was flown by helicopter to Dignity Health in Phoenix where she 
was in neuro ICU on 9/22/23. She was discharged on October 4, 2023. 
Recently, my mom's brain stem has degenerated as she is starting to 
lose control of her right arm. She can barely speak and dysphagia. Also 
Flagstaff Medical Center on 9/22/23 did not bill my mom's Medicare and 
sent a $16,449.24 Medical bill. FMC would tell Navajo patients that 
they would notify Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation (TCRHCC) 
Purchased Referred Care (PRC), but in this case FMC did not. If PRC has 
money, they could pay the bill if notified within 72 hours. PRC was 
notified 12/8/23. PRC option to not pay. FMC was to retaliate against 
Navajos.
    On September 2, 2023 I alleged Fentynal Overdose at FMC Emergency 
Department (ED). Dr. Guy did not believe and did not want to admit her 
under that classification. She said I could admit under another stroke 
which I said yes. Later, she extorted me that I had to agree to send my 
mom to a nursing home. I had to say yes. No MRI was done as she did not 
believe she had a cerebral vascular accident (CVA). She was admitted as 
observational. Next physician was told that to admit to nursing home 
she had to be admitted as inpatient. She was admitted and consulting TV 
neurologist doctor ordered up MRI, CT scans and EEG. EEG picked up mild 
abnormal brain rhythms. Dr. Guy must have gave my mom fentynal on 9/3/
23 at 4:20 am. Medical records say 9/2/23 at 4:20 am, but must be typo 
as my mom was home on 9/2/23 at 4:20 am.
    Who knows how many Navajos were accidentally killed by FMC 
fentynal. I took a genetic test which revealed I have more serious side 
effects to antiseizure drugs. Takes longer for anti-seizure drugs to 
clear my system. FMC gives out narcotics like candy to cure the 
symptoms and not solve the problem. Navajos that go there for help are 
instead fanned out to nursing homes to die on dope. Lots of Navajos 
from the reservation are flown to FMC.

Prepared Statement of Doreen G. Blaker, President, Keweenaw Bay Indian 
                               Community
    I am writing on behalf of the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community 
(``Community''), located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, to express 
support for increased federal funding to address the opiate and 
fentanyl drug issues in the nation. Increased resources would help 
Tribal communities address the severe impacts of the opioid and 
fentanyl crisis that is affecting tribal individuals, families, and 
communities across the nation.
    This ongoing crisis has resulted in a surge of overdoses, deaths, 
and severe negative social consequences across rural and urbru1 tribal 
communities. From our own experiences, we know that people with an 
addiction may require withdrawal management (detoxification); long-term 
inpatient treatment (90+ days); followed by a halfway house (6-months 
to 12-months) to help integrate them back into the Community. Cmrently, 
there is only one detoxification center located in the Upper Peninsula 
of Michigan and very limited funding to cover costs of the needed 
treatments. Many tribal communities also face disparities in quality 
healthcare that can hinder the early detection and treatment of 
substance use disorders. Additionally, people suffering from a 
substance use disorder may require extensive medical, dental, and 
mental health care to help them with recovery. Some chi ldren in the 
Community, as young as twelve years old, experiment with drugs on the 
reservation. Fentanyl comes into our area mixed with other substances 
and causes upswings in overdoses. Lastly, families require services to 
help heal the wounds caused by addiction and services are needed to 
reunify families and help people in recovery find gainful employment 
and obtain affordable housing.
    One way the Community addresses this crisis is through the 
utilization of our Tribal Court's Healing to Wellness (HTW) program, 
which is showing great success. This highly structured program consists 
of four phases to graduate and a fifth phase where if the graduate is 
clean and has no criminal history in a 90-day follow up interview, the 
fines and probation fees that were not vacated at the Graduation 
Ceremony would be waived. Our Healing to Wellness program uses a 
mental, physical, spiritual and emotional approach to ``fill the void'' 
to help prevent recidivism once they graduate from the program. Youth 
prevention services are geared towards counseling our youth and 
teaching them the dangers of drugs such as fentanyl and opiates and 
invites public speakers to speak realistically about addiction and 
recovery. Our tribal police work with other law enforcement agencies to 
address drug trafficking activities on and around the reservation. Our 
law enforcement officers face unknown dangers when confronting people 
in traffic stops or executing search warrants when dealing with 
fentanyl or other illegal substances. The Community's K9 unit is well 
trained and has assisted with drug searches with other agencies. Our 
community connects with every service available to treat people 
addicted to drugs. With the success we have already seen, our Tribal 
Court is exploring the possibility of expanding the HTW program to 
include a HTW Family Court. Another goal is to create a detoxification 
center on the reservation that could service the region.
    In closing, addressing the opioid and fentanyl cns1s in tribal 
commumtles requires a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach 
that considers the unique challenges and strengths of each Tribe. There 
are hundreds of Tribes in the United States, and each has a strong 
sense of self-governance. Additional funding and resources will allow 
Tribes to improve and expand on established, proven, effective 
programming and create opportunities for recovering addicts to become 
sober contributing members of their communities.

    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Brian Schatz to 
                             Adam W. Cohen
    Question 1. Is there data showing how High Intensity Drug 
Trafficking Areas (HIDTAs) are engaging with Tribes to support their 
public safety needs on the ground?
    Answer. Fourteen of the 33 regional HIDTA Programs have task forces 
that include representatives of Tribal police and/or the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs. These multi-jurisdictional task forces bring together 
the resources, expertise, and authorities of federal, state, local, 
Tribal, and territorial agencies to target drug traffickers and their 
networks, and stop them from distributing illicit drugs into our 
communities. These task forces include investigations on Tribal lands 
and on Tribal lands that lie on or near international borders with 
Mexico and Canada.
    In 2022, the most recent year for which data are available, these 
14 HIDTAs disrupted or dismantled 187 drug trafficking organizations, 
apprehended 2,284 fugitives, made 1,894 arrests, and seized 727 
firearms. In addition, these HIDTAs denied criminal organizations 
substantial profits by seizing drugs with a wholesale value of $395 
million, and cash and assets totaling $19 million. In total, all HIDTAs 
seized an estimated $22 billion in illicit drugs and cash in 2022--a 
return on investment of $82.91 for every $1 budgeted for the program.

    Question 2. Does the Hawaii HIDTA work with the Native Hawaiian 
Community?
    Answer. Through its criminal intelligence network, the Hawai`i 
HIDTA closely monitors how drug trafficking affects its communities, 
including those who identify as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islanders. 
This information allows the HIDTA to tailor its investigative 
approaches and demand reduction initiatives to address the needs of 
specific communities. In terms of public safety and public health 
partnerships, the Hawai`i HIDTA engages with a wide variety of 
stakeholders to mitigate the impact of substance use on Kanaka Maoli. 
This engagement includes (1) partnerships for youth prevention; (2) 
training for educators and social services; and (3) support for Health 
Department and private sector organizations working to address the 
disproportionate impacts of Social Determinants of Health on Native 
Hawaiians.
    Prevention Plus Wellness. In partnership with the Hawai`i State 
Department of Health, the Hawai`i HIDTA was able to use funding from 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to purchase a 
statewide license for an evidence-based primary drug prevention program 
called Prevention Plus Wellness (PPW). This funding allows the HIDTA to 
disseminate the PPW curriculum and train implementors free of charge 
throughout the state. Rather than focusing solely on the dangers of 
drug use, PPW utilizes the Behavior-Image Model to help youth imagine 
healthy futures by sharing visual examples of peers enjoying healthy 
behaviors. The images used in the standard PPW curriculum, however, are 
reflective of demographics in the continental United States rather than 
those predominantly found in Hawai`i. Therefore, the Hawai`i HIDTA is 
adapting images used in the curriculum so that they look more like the 
kids they're trying to reach and show healthy activities that are 
popular with Hawai`i youth.
    Palama Settlement. Palama Settlement, established in 1896, predates 
the Territory of Hawaii and served the Kalihi-Palama neighborhood of 
Honolulu since that time. Palama Settlement leadership and youth 
prevention experts from Hilopa`a are building on the kernel of PPW to 
develop a broader program that includes trauma informed care to address 
Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and cultural adaptation of the 
Girls Circle/Boys Council model to better fit with Polynesian and 
Micronesian worldviews.
    The Hawai`i HIDTA was instrumental in connecting Palama Settlement 
with the Honolulu Police Department to plan a youth diversion program 
that will divert low-level youth offenders (including Native Hawaiians) 
from the criminal justice system, and introduces these at-risk youth to 
community and supportive services at Palama Settlement. The Hawai`i 
HIDTA, Palama Settlement, and the Honolulu Police Department have 
received approval to formally partner in developing these comprehensive 
prevention goals under the new Overdose Data to Action in States (OD2A-
S) grant from CDC.
    The Hawai`i HIDTA is also partnering with Palama Settlement who are 
engaged in a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) program, 
which is a collaborative process that involves local community members 
in developing health interventions specific to their needs. Further, 
the Hawai`i HIDTA supported linguistic adaptation of the curriculum by 
translating parent materials into `Olelo Hawaii, Chuukese, and 
Marshallese (new generation of immigrants who seek refuge at Palama 
Settlement). The partnership with Palama Settlement is now growing 
beyond PPW into a comprehensive youth prevention program.
    Hawai`i HIDTA--Overdose Response Strategy. The Hawai`i HIDTA is 
also working with CDC and the Hawai`i State Department of Health to 
develop public health--public safety partnerships through HIDTA's 
Overdose Response Strategy (ORS). The ORS team has conducted dozens of 
training sessions on Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution 
(OEND), Drug Recognition, Data Trends, and Fentanyl Awareness/Safety. 
In collaboration with the University of Hawai`i, the ORS team provided 
several presentations to future public health and social service 
workers that connected the current drug problem to historical traumas 
stretching back to colonialism and land dispossession. The team was 
invited to train several educational institutions, including Kamehameha 
Schools (a school exclusively for Native Hawaiian children) on Drug 
Recognition. In addition to providing information on drug use trends 
and concealment techniques, the ORS team used the public health--public 
safety approach to couple this information with a deeper understanding 
of trauma, adverse childhood experiences, and attachment disorders that 
emphasized the key role of educators in supporting youth who may be 
experimenting with drugs to cope with trouble at home.
    Finally, the positioning of the ORS as a bridge between the Hawai`i 
HIDTA and the State Department of Health has allowed the team to 
provide background support to other partners working to address 
substance use and behavioral health in Native Hawaiian communities. As 
an example, the ORS team was able to provide data to partners from the 
State Department of Health and Papa Ola Lokahi, who successfully 
obtained SAMHSA funding to create the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, 
and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Ohana Center of Excellence (CoE). This 
new CoE is drawing together subject matter experts nationwide to 
provide technical assistance to behavioral health and substance use 
providers who treat AANHPI patients. The CoE also aims to transform our 
understanding of issues affecting these populations, by supporting the 
disaggregation of ethnicity data to better reflect the unique needs of 
each community.

    Question 3. Tribal leaders have testified that illegal drug 
producers and traffickers routinely target Indian Country for illicit 
fentanyl trafficking due to the criminal jurisdictional maze and the 
resulting gaps in law enforcement. What is the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy (ONDCP) doing to address these gaps? What can Congress 
do to help ONDCP's efforts?
    Answer. ONDCP has identified strengthening communities in Tribal 
lands as an essential component of its counternarcotics strategies 
focused on the Southwest and Northern Borders of the United States. 
Through these efforts, ONDCP is coordinating federal efforts to reduce 
illegal trafficking of drugs into or through Indian Country, offer 
technical and financial assistance to Tribal police, build 
infrastructure capacity, including through expanded use of 
multijurisdictional task forces, and to address interoperability 
deficiencies by sharing and pooling resources. ONDCP seeks continued 
federal support to advance these efforts through implementation of the 
Northern and Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategies.
    Navigating jurisdictional complexities in Indian Country is a 
consistent challenge, and frustrates efforts to most efficiently or 
effectively address the crisis. Collaboration across all levels of 
government, especially with Tribal partners is essential to 
strengthening our response to illicit fentanyl trafficking. The 
inclusion of Tribal law enforcement in multijurisdictional drug task 
forces--particularly those operating in border regions--supports 
bridging jurisdictional gaps and is an effective counter-strategy to 
the exploitation of Tribal lands by criminal organizations. ONDCP 
supports these efforts through the HIDTA Program, and has championed 
innovative approaches like the Homeland Security Investigations' Shadow 
Wolves, which participates in the Arizona HIDTA's Native American 
Targeted Investigations of Violent Enterprises (NATIVE) task force, and 
is led by the Tohono O'odham Police Department. The NATIVE task force 
and Shadow Wolves work to reduce, dismantle, and disrupt all forms of 
transnational organized crime, including trafficking and smuggling of 
methamphetamine, illicit fentanyl, humans, firearms, and bulk cash. In 
2022 for example, the Shadow Wolves helped seize 885,344 fentanyl pills 
and 1,060 kilograms of methamphetamine.
    Like many public safety matters in Indian Country, chronic 
underfunding by the federal government exacerbates this crisis, and 
limits what we can do to respond. President Biden's Fiscal Year 2024 
budget calls for $290.2 million in funding for the HIDTA Program, which 
is managed by ONDCP. Funding this program is a successful, time-tested, 
and evidence-based way for Congress to help us reduce the illicit drug 
supply, prevent overdoses and poisonings, save lives, and make our 
communities safer.
                                 ______
                                 
    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Brian Schatz to 
                          Hon. Vanessa Waldref
    Question 1. Tribal leaders have testified that illegal drug 
producers and traffickers routinely target Indian Country for illicit 
fentanyl trafficking due to the criminal jurisdictional maze and the 
resulting gaps in law enforcement. What is the Department doing to 
address these gaps? What can Congress do to help the Department's 
efforts?
    Answer. The Department of Justice has taken steps to address the 
changing landscape of public safety issues in Indian Country. Since 
2010, each U.S. Attorney's Office with Indian country in its district 
has been required to have an Operational Plan that establishes 
protocols for working with other agencies to respond to crime in Indian 
Country. These Operational Plans consider jurisdictional issues, 
including those imposed by Public Law 83-280. Increased coordination 
among Federal, State, Tribal, and local law enforcement agencies is key 
to comprehensive enforcement to combat illicit fentanyl trafficking. In 
July 2022, the Deputy Attorney General directed each U.S. Attorney's 
Office with Indian country in its district to review and revise its 
Operational Plan, and to add a strategy to combat drug trafficking in 
Indian Country and, consistent with Savanna's Act, guidelines to 
respond to cases of missing or murdered American Indian/Alaska Native 
persons. As part of the Department's commitment to honor Tribal 
sovereignty, this memorandum also required United States Attorneys' 
Offices to build intergovernmental relationships with federally 
recognized Tribes within their districts that honor the unique 
conditions and challenges faced by each individual Tribe.
    The Department also provides the Criminal Jurisdiction in Indian 
Country (CJIC) training to State, Tribal, and local law enforcement 
officers. Since August 2020, more than 4,600 police officers 
successfully completed the CJIC training, thereby satisfying one of the 
criteria to receive a Special Law Enforcement Commission (SLEC) from 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs. A SLEC allows those officers to enforce 
federal criminal statutes, including federal drug laws, in Indian 
country. Additionally, each U.S. Attorney's Office with Indian Country 
in its district has an Assistant United States Attorney serving as a 
Tribal Liaison, whose statutory duties include providing technical 
assistance and training regarding evidence-gathering techniques and 
strategies to address victim and witness protection, and conducting 
training sessions and seminars to certify SLECs to tribal justice 
officials and other individuals and entities responsible for responding 
to Indian country crimes. Further, through the FBI's 25 Safe Trails 
Task Forces across the United States, the FBI partners with agencies at 
all levels to target violent crime, illegal drugs, gangs, fraud, and 
crimes against children. Participating State, Tribal, and local task 
force officers are deputized to perform the same functions as FBI 
Special Agents.
    DEA also actively participates in investigations involving Native 
American communities and is working with their counterparts to help in 
dealing with this threat. To combat the illicit fentanyl crisis, the 
permanent class-wide scheduling of fentanyl-related substances is a top 
legislative priority for the Department. Class-wide scheduling allows 
DEA and other law enforcement agencies to seize new, deadly substances 
when they are found, including in Indian Country, and to prosecute 
those who traffic them. The current temporary class-wide scheduling 
expires in 2024. The Administration continues to call on Congress to 
permanently place fentanyl-related substances into Schedule I and to 
take other complementary actions to enhance public health and public 
safety, consistent with the comprehensive proposal developed jointly 
and submitted to Congress by the Department, the Department of Health 
and Human Services, and the White House Office of National Drug Control 
Policy. I encourage Congress to support a long-term, consensus approach 
to reduce the supply and availability of illicitly manufactured 
fentanyl-related substances.

    Question 2. Attorney Waldref, during the Committee's November 8th 
hearing on fentanyl, Tribal leaders testified that drug trafficking is 
destroying their communities, and while they are doing what they can to 
address treatment and prevention of fentanyl misuse, Tribes are 
currently unable to exercise criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians for 
drug offenses. Consequently, Tribes must rely on state and federal 
partners to investigate, arrest, and prosecute such offenses. Tribal 
leaders testified that these partnerships aren't enough to fill 
jurisdictional gaps, and traffickers exploit those weaknesses. Would 
restoration of Tribal special criminal jurisdiction over non- Indians 
who commit drug offenses on Tribal lands help address these issues? How 
could existing law be amended to assist?
    Answer. The Department of Justice is committed to engaging and 
consulting with Tribes regarding the exercise of ``special Tribal 
criminal jurisdiction'' (STCJ) over non-Indian offenders, as provided 
in the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022 (VAWA 
2022). VAWA 2022 recognizes the inherent authority of Tribes to 
exercise STCJ over non-Indian offenders who commit covered crimes--such 
as dating violence, domestic violence, sexual violence, violation of a 
protection order, sex trafficking, stalking, child violence, 
obstruction of justice, and assault of Tribal justice personnel--in 
Indian country. To the extent that criminal conduct by a non-Indian 
implicates one of these crimes, Tribes that have implemented STCJ would 
be able to exercise criminal jurisdiction over such a subject. In 
addition, Section 813(d) of VAWA 2022 establishes the Alaska Pilot 
Program, which enables Alaska Tribes designated by the Attorney General 
to exercise STCJ over non-Indian defendants for a covered crime in 
their Villages. Tribal implementation of STCJ and the Alaska Pilot 
Program will provide valuable information about the expansion of STCJ.
    Further, as described above, the Department will continue to 
provide the Criminal Jurisdiction in Indian Country (CJIC) training to 
State, Tribal, and local law enforcement officers, which enables these 
officers to receive a Special Law Enforcement Commission (SLEC) from 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs. An SLEC allows those officers--including 
Tribal police officers--to enforce federal criminal statutes, including 
federal drug laws, against both Indian and non-Indian subjects, in 
Indian Country. Tribal prosecuting attorneys can be designated as 
Special Assistant United States Attorneys to prosecute federal 
offenses, including those committed by non-Indian subjects. 
Additionally, through the FBI's 25 Safe Trails Task Forces across the 
United States, the FBI partners with agencies at all levels to target 
violent crime, illegal drugs, gangs, fraud, and crimes against 
children. Participating State, Tribal, and local task force officers 
are deputized federally to perform the same functions as FBI Special 
Agents.
    Informed by these and other resources, the Department's Office of 
Legislative Affairs is available to provide technical assistance on 
legislation proposed by Congress that addresses criminal jurisdiction 
in Indian country.
                                 ______
                                 
    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Brian Schatz to 
                             Glen Melville
    Question 1. Tribal leaders have testified that illegal drug 
producers and traffickers routinely target Indian Country for illicit 
fentanyl trafficking due to the criminal jurisdictional maze and the 
resulting gaps in law enforcement. What is the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
doing to address these gaps? What can Congress do to help the Bureau's 
efforts?
    Answer. Congress and the courts have tied decisions on who 
exercises criminal jurisdiction to several factors. These factors 
include the type of crime, Indian or non-Indian status of the 
defendant, Indian or non-Indian status of the victim, and whether the 
crime scene lies within Indian country. In Indian country, determining 
these factors is often a complex element to be resolved before 
beginning investigation. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) uses 
interagency coordination to address these jurisdictional complexities. 
For example, some Tribes sign memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with 
local and state law enforcement to coordinate addressing illegal 
activity on Tribal lands. The Department of the Interior (Department) 
has also signed an MOU with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
to establish guidelines regarding the handling of investigative 
matters. The MOU provides for the effective and efficient 
administration of criminal investigations in Indian country.
    BIA Drug Agents and Tribal officers alike participate in drug task 
forces with the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Homeland 
Security Investigation, as well as many states. These task forces 
broaden BIA's ability to address criminal activity. BIA currently is 
involved in numerous Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force 
(OCDETF) cases in multiple states and impacting multiple Tribes. In 
addition, BIA provides Mobile Enforcement Team (MET) deployments to 
various Tribal jurisdictions focusing on high impact covert and overt 
enforcement operations that target traffickers and dealers of illegal 
narcotics to and through Indian country.
    These MOUs and task forces, as well as the High Intensity Drug 
Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program, aid in the sharing of information 
across jurisdictional lines and in the enforcement of federal, state, 
and tribal drug laws against those who attempt to capitalize on the 
jurisdictional complexities.
    Congress has legislated to clarify and affirm criminal jurisdiction 
in Indian country, notably in the reauthorization of the Violence 
Against Women Act in 2022. Congress also enacted Savanna's Act and the 
Not Invisible Act to improve and reform intergovernmental coordination 
and establish best practices for state-tribal-federal law enforcement 
to combat the epidemic of missing persons, murder, and trafficking of 
Native Americans and Alaska Natives, which is intricately tied with 
illegal drug trafficking and have created appropriate models for 
addressing the fentanyl crisis in Indian country. Promoting 
coordination and the restoration of Tribal jurisdiction over certain 
crimes demonstrates that Indian Tribes must be centered in any efforts 
to meet the public welfare and safety needs of communities within their 
jurisdictions. The Department supports these goals and interagency 
cooperation to ensure that Tribal communities are safe.

    Question 2. How are Tiwahe-supported wellness courts helping Tribal 
communities heal from the impacts of illicit fentanyl use, and what can 
Congress do to strengthen and expand the Tiwahe Initiative?
    Answer. Many Tribes are reforming or creating judicial systems to 
incorporate traditional and cultural aspects through Healing to 
Wellness Courts. In addition to dealing with narcotics issues, Tiwahe-
supported Healing to Wellness courts also address child dependency and 
family matters brought by the Tribal social service agencies and play 
an essential role in family reunification by providing support and 
services needed for parents to complete within the reunification plan. 
Many Tribes have seen an improvement in the reunification process when 
relatives and community members provide encouragement and support to 
those families needing assistance. These reunification efforts are more 
successful through the Healing to Wellness court process, as is 
addressing addiction issues, which often go hand in hand with child 
dependency cases. The Tiwahe funding has also provided funding for 
essential positions for Tribes seeking to have representation in state 
court on Indian child welfare matters. In fiscal year 2024, the Biden-
Harris administration requested an additional $1,850,000 to further 
expand Healing to Wellness Courts.
    The focus of all these courts is to address issues ``upstream'' 
instead of dealing with ultimately tragic issues that debilitate Tribal 
communities.

    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Brian Schatz to 
                            Hon. Roselyn Tso
    Question 1. As co-chair of the Department of Health and Human 
Services' Intra-Departmental Council for Native American Affairs, what 
steps are you taking to make sure your sister agencies, including the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services and Food and Drug 
Administrations, are addressing Native communities' fentanyl related 
needs?
    Answer. The Indian Health Service (IHS) is collaborating with the 
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Department of 
Veterans Affairs as well as other Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) sister agencies and federal interagency partners 
following the tenets outlined in Reforming Federal Funding and Support 
for Tribal Nations to Better Embrace Our Trust Responsibilities and 
Promote the Next Era of Tribal Self-Determination Executive Order. 
Examples of collaboration include:

  <bullet> IHS working with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
        Services Administration (SAMHSA) to identify potential 
        opportunities for synergy and improved technical assistance for 
        expanding access to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) 
        and whole health approaches to community wellness under the 
        Tribal Law and Order Act. This includes providing an overview 
        of the new IHS Naloxone Safety Net Program.

  <bullet> IHS co-chairing the National Institutes of Health Native 
        Collective Research Effort to Enhance Wellness Program and 
        providing two panelists for ongoing technical support. This 
        effort will result in approximately $268 million new monies to 
        support Tribal communities and the development of additional 
        practice-based evidence.

  <bullet> IHS providing representatives for four Office of National 
        Drug Control Policy Interagency Workgroups and five HHS 
        Overdose Prevention subcommittees. The focus of these working 
        groups include interventions addressing stigma, improving 
        screening for substance use disorders, enhancing peer recovery 
        and recovery ready workforce strategies, treating stimulant use 
        disorders (including contingency management), enhancing 
        linkages to care, and increasing access to harm reduction 
        services.

  <bullet> IHS is collaborating with the Food and Drug Administration 
        (FDA) to host the November 13, 2024 High Dosage Buprenorphine 
        round-table for Indian Health Service/Tribal/Urban Organization 
        (I/T/U) clinicians. This roundtable provided an opportunity for 
        IHS prescribers to share feedback on dosing strategies needed 
        to support treatment engagement for persons exposed to high-
        potency opioids (including fentanyl).

    Question 2. What HHS services are available in the Native Hawaiian 
Community to combat and prevent fentanyl misuse?
    Answer. The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) 
administers the Native Hawaiian Health Care System Program grants, 
which provides comprehensive health promotion, disease prevention, and 
primary health services, as required by the Native Hawaiian Health Care 
Improvement Act. The five systems (Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i, serving Kaua`i 
and Niihau; Ke Ola Mamo, serving O`ahu; Na Pu`uwai, serving Molokai and 
Lana`i; Hui No Ke Ola Pono ,serving Maui; and Hui Malama Ola Na `Oiwi, 
serving Hawai`i) provide physician services, outreach services, and 
health education services specific to the Native Hawaiian population by 
Native Hawaiian health care practitioners, wherever possible. All five 
systems provide mental health services and two provide substance use 
disorder (SUD) services as well.
    Additionally, HRSA's Health Center Program is a cornerstone in our 
country's health care system, providing care to over 30 million 
individuals in nearly 15,000 sites in medically under-served areas. For 
many communities, they are the only access to health care. In 2022, the 
Health Center Program served 270,660 patients who identify as Native 
Hawaiian and Pacific Islander. Additionally, some health centers can 
provide behavioral health services, including SUD treatment. The Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2024 President's Budget included a proposal to require that 
all health centers provide mental health and SUD services. Currently, 
health centers are meeting approximately 27 percent of the estimated 
demand for mental health services, and approximately six percent of the 
estimated demand for SUD services among their patients.
    SAMHSA State Opioid Response Grants--Currently, the Hawaii State 
Department of Health, Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division (ADAD), provides 
naloxone to all county police departments, public safety, and syringe 
exchange entities through the Hawaii Health and Harm Reduction Center 
(HHHRC). Naloxone is purchased through a combination of State Opioid 
Response (SOR) funds, opioid litigation settlement funds, and other 
grant initiatives.
    From December 2022 through December 2023, Hawaii reported the 
following data using SOR funds:

  <bullet> 22,272 naloxone kits purchased
  <bullet> 19,766 naloxone kits distributed
  <bullet> 319 overdose reversals reported
  <bullet> 1,359 first responders trained
  <bullet> 1,959 individuals in key community sectors trained
  <bullet> 1,248 persons educated on the consequences of misuse

    The Hawaii Opioid Initiative website provides the public with 
culturally relevant and easy to understand information about treatment 
access, safe drug disposal, naloxone availability, behavioral health 
resources, and other tools and resources to reduce illicit opioid and 
stimulant use, misuse, and overdoses.
    Naloxone dissemination and anti-stigma media campaigns have greatly 
increased. The Prevention and Public Education workgroup from the 
Hawaii Opioid Initiative launched a ``Talk Story'' campaign, using 
stories of resilience to promote naloxone, access to treatment, and to 
address stigma pertaining to opioid use disorder and stimulant use 
disorders. In addition, ADAD partners with the HHHRC to provide 
overdose prevention education.
    There are service providers and organizations providing SUD 
treatment, drug prevention and support services to Native Hawaiians. 
For example, with the assistance of the 2022 Hawaii SOR grant, ADAD 
contracts with specific organizations to provide culturally anchored 
primary prevention. The Na Pua No`eau Program emphasizes the need for 
cultural reclamation and identity within the family setting and among 
younger generations through cultural knowledge, history, music, 
stories, skills, and other types of prevention and support.
    ADAD plans to use SOR-III funds, in combination with opioid 
litigation settlement funds, to purchase fentanyl test strips (FTS). By 
September 19, 2024, they plan to enhance and implement a revised 
statewide naloxone and FTS distribution program.
    Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services Block 
Grant (SUPTRS BG)--There are a number of fentanyl and opioid-related 
initiatives targeting illicit fentanyl use funded by SAMHSA's SUPTRS 
BG: purchase and distribution of naloxone and FTS, culturally-anchored 
primary prevention programs targeting Native Hawaiians, the Hawaii 
Island Fentanyl Task Force (Task Force), and increasing treatment 
program capacity statewide.
    The passage of Act 111, Session Laws Hawaii, 2023, which excluded 
FTS from the definition of drug paraphernalia in the Uniformed 
Controlled Substance Act, has allowed ADAD to purchase and distribute 
25,000 FTS statewide.
    ADAD has increased naloxone distribution to the Hawaii State 
Department of Education, Hawaii Liquor Commission, bars, restaurants, 
hotels, and private schools. Seizures of illicit fentanyl by law 
enforcement has also increased. Using block grant funds, ADAD has 
partnered with the Hawaii High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) 
to provide trainings to organizations across the state. This has been 
beneficial in providing education about opioids and new and emerging 
drugs, thus decreasing the power of scare tactics and stigma. Between 
FY 2021 and FY 2023, a total of 63,252 naloxone kits were purchased and 
distributed statewide. There has been an increase in requests for 
naloxone in the past year due to the increase in news coverage about 
illicit fentanyl and opioids, the increase of overdoses throughout the 
islands, and the overall increase in awareness and education about 
opioids.
    ADAD partnered with the Task Force on a community-based 
organization established in November of 2021, to address the opioid 
crisis on Hawaii Island. The Task Force distributes naloxone and FTS, 
conducts informational and prevention presentations at schools and 
other community events, and interacts with/supports local treatment 
providers, local first responders and law enforcement. It is being used 
as a model to develop other fentanyl task forces on the four major 
islands: Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and Hawaii Island.
    SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT)--As of 
December 6, 2023, SAMHSA/CSAT supported 4 active opioid treatment 
programs (OTPs) in Hawaii.
    CSAT's provides ongoing training and support of the state's Opioid 
Treatment Authorities (SOTA). Hawaii's SOTA participated in in-person 
meetings in 2022 and 2023 in addition to regularly scheduled virtual 
meetings. These meetings were used to discuss integration of MOUD in 
the state's prison system, use of mobile units, planned revisions to 
part 8 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, the federal 
regulations that set standards for treatment in Opioid Treatment 
Programs, and other topics to better support state efforts.
    In December 2023, CSAT provided onsite training and technical 
assistance for the Hawaii State ADAD and visited two of its treatment 
facilities. The training oriented Hawaii staff on CSAT's current 
priorities, and the benefits of MOUD and ways in which the state and 
OTPs might address local service needs, including the state's plans for 
expansion of MOUD.
    SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP)--CSAP's 
Strategic Prevention Framework--Partnerships for Success (SPF-PFS) 
program provides funding to states, Tribes, territories, and 
communities to focus on substance use prevention, which in some 
communities may include a focus on illicit fentanyl and other opioid 
misuse.
    Both the Coalition for Drug-Free Hawaii and ADAD have received SPF-
PFS funding, and both have carried out activities to address illicit 
fentanyl use:

  <bullet> October 2022, the Coalition disseminated social media 
        messages to raise awareness about illicit fentanyl as part of 
        the Red Ribbon Week campaign; and

  <bullet> November 2023, the Hawaii Department of Health provided 
        funding to the East Hawaii Drug-Free Coalition to train staff 
        and volunteers from the Big Island Substance Abuse Council, 
        Kohala Resilience Hub, Hawaii Island Tobacco-Free Coalition, 
        and Vibrant Hawaii as Choose Not to Use Facilitators and equip 
        them with skills to present about illicit fentanyl and other 
        drugs, alcohol, and nicotine to students, parent groups, kupuna 
        groups, and Hawaii Department of Education staff/educators.

    In addition, through its First Responders-Comprehensive Addiction 
and Recovery Act Grants (FR-CARA) program, CSAP provides resources to 
support first responders and members of other key community sectors on 
training, administering, and providing naloxone and other over-the-
counter opioid overdose reversal medications that are approved by the 
FDA. State and local governments, including those that serve Native 
Hawaiian communities, are eligible for FR-CARA.
    Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Behavioral 
Health Center of Excellence (AANHPI-CoE)--SAMHSA funds the Asian 
American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Behavioral Health 
Center of Excellence (AANHPI-CoE) or `Ohana Center of Excellence, which 
serves as a resource to behavioral healthcare providers, community-
based and faith-based organizations, research institutions, and federal 
entities by providing trainings and technical assistance specific to 
the behavioral health of AANHPI communities. Technical assistance is 
completed on case-by-case basis based on requested information. Replays 
of past webinars are accessible here Event Replays--`Ohana Center of 
Excellence (aanhpi-ohana.org). `Ohana also has a free harm reduction 
toolkit and harm reduction webinar on their website, both of which were 
spearheaded by a Native Hawaiian health organization, Papa Ola Lokahi.
    Behavioral Health and SUD Resources for Native Americans--The 
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 authorized SAMHSA to award 
funding through the Behavioral Health and Substance Use Disorder 
Resources for Native Americans program. The purpose of the program is 
to provide services for the prevention of, treatment of, and recovery 
from mental health and substance use disorders among American Indians, 
Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. Eligible entities include any 
health program administered directly by the IHS, a Tribal health 
program, an Indian Tribe, a Tribal organization, an Urban Indian 
organization, and Papa Ola Lokahi. Although the program was authorized 
at $80,000,000 for each FY from 2023 through 2027, no funds have been 
appropriated for this program.
    Additionally, the Division of Behavioral Health (DBH) within the 
Indian Health Services serves as the primary administration of 
behavioral health, alcohol and substance use, and family violence 
prevention programs for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) 
people. Working in partnership with Tribes, Tribal organizations, and 
Urban Indian health organizations, DBH coordinates national efforts to 
share knowledge and build capacity through the development and 
implementation of evidence-based, practice-based and culturally-based 
activities in Indian Country.

    Question 3. Last month, Secretary Becerra sent a letter to Tribes 
and Urban Indian Organizations about fake sober homes that target 
American Indians and Alaska Natives experiencing substance use disorder 
and mental health issues. What is the Indian Health Service and HHS 
doing to respond to this fraud, including coordination with the 
Department of Justice?
    Answer. The IHS response has been twofold: (1) to assist 
individuals directly impacted by fraudulent activity and (2) to alert 
our communities and ensure that reports of alleged fraudulent activity 
are communicated to the appropriate authorities.

    1. Assisting individuals impacted by this fraudulent scheme has 
required coordination across all of the Indian Health Service and with 
all of Government. In May 2023, the IHS Phoenix, Tucson, and Navajo 
Area Offices established an Incident Command at the Phoenix Indian 
Medical Center and opened a Community Intake Center, which coordinates 
with the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System contracted Solari 
Crisis Response Network, as well as with other local community, Tribal, 
and Urban Indian Health Programs to aid beneficiaries in need of 
immediate housing, transportation, and health services following a 
provider closure. Also, in May 2023, IHS issued a Dear Tribal Leader 
Letter \1\ to alert Tribes across the country about fraudulent schemes 
targeting Native American communities in Behavioral Health Treatment 
Centers. In August 2023, IHS Area Directors selected individuals to 
serve as points of contact for concerns related to fraudulent 
behavioral health activity, given that many impacted Tribal members are 
from communities outside of Arizona and provided training on how to 
address fraudulent behavioral health incidents and facilitated ongoing 
collaboration and sharing of information. In February 2024, based on 
consensus that the IHS response has moved out of the emergency 
management phase, the Incident Command team has stood down the Joint 
Incident Command, moving this into an ongoing operational phase to 
continue to assist individuals affected by fraudulent providers.

    2. Each account of suspicious activity related to residential 
behavioral health centers or sober living has been reviewed and 
forwarded to the HHS Office of the Inspector General and the Federal 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau of Investigation for their review.

    Question 4. How is IHS implementing the Biden Administration's 
National Response Plan to address fentanyl combined with xylazine in 
Indian Country? Are additional tools or resources needed to support IHS 
and Tribes as they respond to the emerging threat of xylazine?
    Answer. The IHS continues to emphasize harm reduction and work-
force development strategies to implement the activities in the 
Fentanyl Adulterated or Associated with Xylazine National Response 
Plan. \2\ Specifically, we have developed a new Naloxone Safety Net 
Pilot Program to deliver additional naloxone doses to sites struggling 
to meet needs. The IHS is developing a mandatory employee training 
titled, Reversing Opioid Overdose with Naloxone, to increase awareness 
for all persons to recognize and respond to life-threatening opioid-
related overdose events that may occur in the health-system setting or 
in the community. Additionally, the IHS has developed community 
education tools for illicit fentanyl and has supported access to 
fentanyl and xylazine test strips through centralized procurement 
activities.

Report-July-2023.pdf 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Additional resources are necessary to support an effective response 
to the overdose crisis intensified by emerging drug threats, including 
xylazine, and to expand the impact of the following evidence-based 
strategies: increase access to harm reduction supplies; build community 
navigator response capacity to effectively connect persons to 
treatment; create/expand holistic detoxification and residential 
treatment models; expand capability to manage co-occurring SUD and 
behavioral health conditions; and improve data linkages to effectively 
target strategies.
