                       WEDNESDAY, APRIL 26, 2023

                              United States Senate,
                                Committee on the Judiciary,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice at 10:04 a.m., in 
Room 216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Richard J. Durbin, 
Chair of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Durbin [presiding], Whitehouse, 
Klobuchar, Blumenthal, Hirono, Booker, Padilla, Ossoff, Welch, 
Graham, Grassley, Cornyn, Lee, Cruz, Hawley, Kennedy, Tillis, 
and Blackburn.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN,
           A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

    Chair Durbin. Good morning. This hearing of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee will come to order.
    Over the past year, Americans have learned a painful lesson 
on the dangers of judicial activism. Lives have been disrupted, 
life-saving healthcare has been declared illegal, and women 
have been denied their fundamental liberties. The chaos began 
last June, June the 24th, when the Supreme Court issued its 
decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.
    With a single ruling, the right-wing majority overruled 
five decades of legal precedent, revoking a constitutional 
right for the first time ever in the history of this Nation.
    In the years leading up to the Dobbs decision, we were 
warned about the danger of overruling Roe v. Wade. Medical 
experts warned us it would unleash an immediate healthcare 
crisis across this Nation. Legal experts warned us it would 
establish a dangerous precedent in which unelected judges can 
deny fundamental freedoms.
    And women across the country warned us that overturning Roe 
v. Wade would insert politicians and judges into the most 
personal decision imaginable, and ultimately force women into 
continuing pregnancies that may not be viable or may endanger 
their lives. Tragically, all of these warnings have proven to 
be true. I'd like to turn to a video on the impact of the Dobbs 
decision.
    [Video is presented.]
    Chair Durbin. With the Dobbs decision, Justice Alito and 
the majority claimed that overruling Roe would finally settle 
the so-called controversy over abortion by returning the issue 
to the States and elected leaders. Well, months later, we've 
learned the opposite is true. The Dobbs decision didn't resolve 
anything. It merely replaced controversy with chaos, and it 
paved the way for activist judges and Republican lawmakers to 
try to impose their anti-choice agenda on everyone else.
    Even in States that have protected the right to abortion, 
their ultimate goal is clear: total ban on abortion nationwide.
    So instead of ending the debate on abortion, Dobbs was 
really the beginning of a different debate. How far will the 
war on women's health go before we say enough is enough? From 
the moment Roe was overruled, women and medical professionals 
were thrust into a sea of confusion and fear. The laws 
surrounding abortion and miscarriage management seem to be 
changing by the week.
    And doctors have no idea if the care they provided today 
will be legal tomorrow. A few weeks ago, a judge in Amarillo, 
Texas, issued a nationwide ruling, banning one of the safest 
forms of reproductive care, mifepristone. It's a medication 
approved more than 20 years ago by the Food and Drug 
Administration. It is used in more than half of all abortions 
in America, and it is used to help women suffering from 
miscarriages. This medicine has a safety profile better than 
penicillin, Tylenol, and Viagra.
    Thankfully, the Supreme Court issued a temporary reprieve 
by staying the decision last week. So for the moment, 
mifepristone remains on the market as a case that's considered 
on the merits.
    But the district court's judge's initial ruling marked the 
first time--first time ever that a judge has overruled the FDA 
to ban a medication that they deemed safe and effective--
medical and scientific experts backing them up at our Federal 
drug regulatory agency.
    It begs the obvious question, what's next? Is it going to 
be birth control pills? The morning after pill?
    Do we want to live in a country where judges and 
politicians replace doctors, medical experts, and scientists as 
the arbiters of which drugs are safe? The number of horror 
stories that have emerged over the past year is staggering. 
Stories of rape victims as young as 10 years of age being 
denied healthcare because of laws outlawing abortion. Stories 
of women being forced to leave their home States and travel 
hundreds of miles to access basic reproductive care services.
    Stories of pregnant women suffering miscarriages, who've 
been turned away by doctors who, through no fault of their own, 
are afraid of breaking this law in this new Dobbs world. You'll 
hear one of these stories this morning.
    That's why Congress needs to step up and address this 
chaos. We need to respect the rights of women to make their own 
health care decisions.
    And we can do it by passing the Women's Health Protection 
Act, which would restore abortion access across America. Now 
the question is, will our Republican colleagues stand with the 
vast majority of Americans who support legal access to 
abortion? With that, I turn to Ranking Member Graham for his 
opening statement.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LINDSEY O. GRAHAM,
        A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it 
very much.
    Before we start, in 15 days, the Biden administration is 
going to basically do away with the ability to deport people 
under Title 42. There's going to be a gasoline thrown on an 
illegal immigration fire. People on our side are going to write 
the President, and we would like you to join us if you could, 
to reverse this decision. Thousands of people are waiting for 
this moment to pass, and it's just going to create chaos upon 
chaos.
    So, I request my Democratic colleagues, if you could, to 
join us in urging President Biden to change his mind about 
abandoning the Title 42 deportation. I think in a few weeks, 
we'll see why I say this.
    To the topic at hand, I appreciate very much the hearing. 
And we'll try to do this in a very respectful way. After Dobbs, 
our Democratic friends are basically declaring war on the 
unborn.
    [Poster is displayed.]
    Senator Graham. This is an emotional decision. Two-thirds 
of Americans believe abortion should be limited after the first 
3 months.
    [Poster is displayed.]
    Senator Graham. And our friends on the other side have the 
Women's Health Protection Act, which has really no limits on 
abortion. There is a healthcare exception after viability that 
is no exception at all. It puts America in the company of North 
Korea and China that allow abortion on demand up to the moment 
of birth. It takes all the State-level protections and 
abolishes them. The bottom line, it doesn't codify Roe, Mr. 
Chairman. It becomes one of the most extreme laws anywhere in 
the world.
    Colorado, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, are 
passing laws with absolutely no restrictions. The Democratic 
bill is of the same ilk with taxpayer funded. Let's take a look 
and see how that would put us as a nation, regarding the rest 
of the world.
    [Poster is displayed.]
    Senator Graham. As you see, behind me, 47 of 50 European 
Union nations limit abortion at 15 weeks or below. France is at 
14 weeks. China, North Korea, Iran, and a few other nations, 
allow abortion on demand up to the moment of birth. And your 
bill would put us in that category.
    [Poster is displayed.]
    Senator Graham. Fourteen-week limitations: France, Belgium, 
Germany, Spain. Twelve weeks: Denmark, Norway. My proposal is 
having a national minimum standard of 15 weeks for exceptions 
for rape, incest, life of the mother pregnancies. Why do we do 
this?
    [Poster is displayed.]
    Senator Graham. By 15 weeks, an unborn child has teeth, 
fingers, and toes, may begin sucking their thumb or making a 
fist. Each finger moves independently. Fingerprints have become 
to develop, fully formed organs, and feel pain.
    If you operate on a 15-week-old unborn child, the standard 
practice is to provide anesthesia because the baby can feel 
pain. That's why 47 of 50 European Union nations prohibit 
abortion on demand after 15 weeks or below. Your proposal, Mr. 
Chairman, puts America in a category I think most Americans 
reject, abortion on demand up to the moment of birth, taxpayer 
funded, which I believe is barbaric.
    [Poster is displayed.]
    Senator Graham. So, what do we do? We're going to debate 
this topic. We're going to try to find consensus. But as for 
me, I'm going to lend my voice to the idea that America post-
Dobbs should not be like North Korea and China, that America 
post-Dobbs should draw a line. States can take their own path 
up to a point. And the line I have drawn is 15 weeks.
    [Poster is displayed.]
    Senator Graham. A line that puts you in association with a 
civilized world and rejects the barbaric practice of abortion 
on demand up to the moment of birth with taxpayer funding. NPR 
poll today said 66 percent of Americans support limiting 
abortion after 12 weeks.
    I don't know how long it will take, but I do believe over 
time, in a post-Dobbs world, Americans are going to come to a 
consensus on this issue. The numbers are pretty compelling for 
early-stage abortions. Most Americans feel comfortable with a 
woman making that decision, but the more we learn about the 
unborn child, the more we understand how it develops, the more 
we're going to have a consensus in this country that there 
needs to be a point in time, Mr. Chairman, where we draw a 
line.
    Allowing abortion on demand up to the moment of birth with 
taxpayer funding doesn't make America a better place. It makes 
us an outlier in the civilized world. So, I welcome the debate. 
It's going to be part of the 2024 election cycle and beyond.
    And I will close with this. This is a moment for America to 
have some self-reflection on a very difficult topic. Why does 
most of the world, particularly Europe, limit abortion at 15 
weeks or under? And why would we choose to be North Korea and 
China on this topic? It'd be a debate worthy of a great Nation. 
Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Graham. And I certainly 
respect your point of view, but I want to respond to it because 
you've made reference to a bill that I support.
    Here are the facts: According to the Center for Disease 
Control, abortions after 21 weeks make up less than 1 percent 
of all abortions in the United States. When abortions later in 
a woman's pregnancy happen, they can hardly be considered 
elective.
    There are three main reasons why women need access to an 
abortion late in pregnancy: maternal health endangerment, 
diagnosis of severe fetal abnormalities which did not show up 
until late in the pregnancy, or restrictive State laws that 
made it difficult for a woman to get an abortion earlier in 
pregnancy.
    The exceptionally rare cases that occur after 24 weeks are 
often because a fetus has a condition that cannot be treated 
and will never be able to survive, such as anencephaly, where 
the fetus forms without a complete brain or skull, or Limb Body 
Wall Complex, where the organs develop outside the body cavity. 
I don't believe this is a nonchalant decision late in 
pregnancy. I think it's a medical emergency in many cases. And 
in this situation, I think the analogy to other countries and 
their standards does not apply.
    Today, we welcome five witnesses, and I thank them for 
joining us. Before we swear the witnesses in, I'll briefly 
introduce the Democratic witnesses, then turn to Senator Graham 
to introduce his witnesses.
    Our first witness is Amanda Zurawski. Ms. Zurawski has 
joined us from Texas. She is here to speak to her personal 
experience of being denied healthcare when she needed it. I'm 
grateful for your traveling here, Ms. Zurawski.

at the University of California, Irvine. She also serves as the 
director of the Center for Biotechnology and Global Health 
Policy at UCI Law. Welcome.
    Dr. Nisha Verma is an OB-GYN in Georgia, where she provides 
comprehensive reproductive healthcare. She also serves as a 
fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. Thank you, Dr. 
Verma.
    Now, Senator Graham, your witnesses.
    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    We have Dr. Ingrid Skop. Is that right? She's been a 
practicing board-certified OB-GYN physician in San Antonio, 
Texas, for 27 years. She received her bachelor of science in 
physiology from Oklahoma State, and her medical doctorate from 
Washington University School of Medicine. She completed her 
residency at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San 
Antonio.

subsequently served as senior deputy assistant administrator in 
the Bureau for Global Health at the United States Agency for 
International Development.
    She is a senior research associate at the Center for Ethics 
and Culture at the University of Notre Dame. Her clinical 
career is focused on caring for women in underserved and 
disadvantaged populations, especially African Americans and 
Native-American communities, with a focus on women with 
medical, social, and psychiatric problems. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Graham. Let me lay out the 
mechanics of today's hearing. After we swear in the witnesses, 
each witness will have 5 minutes for an opening statement. Then 
Senators will have an opportunity to ask questions for up to 5 
minutes. Can I ask the witnesses to please stand and raise 
their right hand?
    [Witnesses are sworn in.]
    Chair Durbin. Let the record reflect that the witnesses 
have all answered in the affirmative. And our first witness 
will be Ms. Zurawski.

          STATEMENT OF AMANDA ZURAWSKI, AUSTIN, TEXAS

    Ms. Zurawski. Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Graham, and 
Members of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, thank you for 
the opportunity to testify before you today.
    My name is Amanda Zurawski, and I'm here to tell you a 
little bit about my experience with the Texas abortion bans. 
About 8 months ago, I was thrilled to be cruising through the 
second trimester of my first pregnancy. I was carrying our 
daughter, Willow, who had finally blissfully been conceived 
after 18 months of a grueling fertility treatment.
    My husband, Josh, and I were beyond thrilled. Then on a 
sunny August day, after I had just finished the invite list for 
the baby shower my sister was planning for me, everything 
changed.
    Some unexpected symptoms arrived and I contacted my 
obstetrician to be safe and was surprised when I was told to 
come in as soon as possible. After a brief examination, my 
husband and I received the harrowing news that I had dilated 
prematurely due to a condition known as cervical insufficiency. 
Soon after, my membranes ruptured and we were told by multiple 
doctors that the loss of our daughter was inevitable.
    It was clear that this was not a question of if we would 
lose our baby. It was a question of when. I asked what could be 
done to ensure the respectful passing of our baby and to 
protect me, now that my body was unprotected and vulnerable. I 
needed an abortion. My healthcare team was anguished, as they 
explained there was nothing they could do because of Texas 
anti-abortion laws, the latest of which had taken effect 2 days 
after my water broke.
    It meant that even though we would, with complete 
certainty, lose Willow, my doctors didn't feel safe enough to 
intervene as long as her heart was beating or until I was sick 
enough for the ethics board at the hospital to consider my life 
at risk.
    I shouldn't have had to wait in anguish for days for the 
inescapable ill fate that awaited. But this was August 2022 in 
the State of Texas, where abortion is illegal unless the 
pregnant person is facing a life-threatening physical condition 
aggravated by, caused by, or arising from, a pregnancy.
    People have asked why we didn't travel to a State where the 
laws aren't so restrictive, but we live in the middle of Texas. 
And the nearest sanctuary State is at least an 8-hour drive. 
Developing sepsis, a condition that can kill in under an hour, 
in a car in the middle of the West Texas desert, or on an 
airplane, is a death sentence. And it's not a choice we should 
have even had to consider in the first place.
    So, all we could do was wait. I cannot adequately put into 
words the trauma and despair that comes with waiting to either 
lose your own life, your child's, or both. For days, I was 
locked in this bizarre and avoidable hell. Would Willow's heart 
stop? Or would I deteriorate to the brink of death?
    The answer arrived three long days later. In a matter of 
minutes, I went from being physically healthy to developing a 
raging fever and dangerously low blood pressure.
    My husband rushed me to the hospital, where we soon learned 
I was in septic shock, made evident by my violent teeth 
chattering and incapacity to even respond to questions. Several 
hours later, after stabilizing just enough to deliver our 
stillborn daughter, my vitals crashed again. In the middle of 
the night, I was rapidly transferred to the ICU, where I would 
stay for 3 days as medical professionals battled to save my 
life. What I needed was an abortion, a standard medical 
procedure.
    An abortion would have prevented the unnecessary harm and 
suffering that I endured, not only the psychological trauma 
that came with 3 days of waiting, but the physical harm my body 
suffered, the extent of which is still being determined.
    Two things I know for sure: the preventable harm inflicted 
on me has already made it harder for me to get pregnant again; 
the barbaric restrictions that are being passed across the 
country are having real-life implications on real people.
    I may have been one of the first who was affected by the 
overturning of Roe in Texas, but I'm certainly not the last. 
More people have been, and will continue to be, harmed until we 
do something about it.
    You have the power to fix this. You owe it to me, and to 
Willow, and to every other person who may become pregnant in 
this country to protect our right to safe and accessible 
healthcare--emergency or no emergency. No one should have to 
worry about the life of their loved ones simply because they 
are with child.
    Your job is to protect the lives of the people who elected 
you, not endanger them. Being pregnant is difficult and 
complicated enough. We do not need you to make it even more 
terrifying and, frankly, downright dangerous to create life in 
this country. This has gone on long enough. And it's time now 
for you to do your job, your duty, and protect us. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Zurawski appears as a 
submission for the record.]
    Chair Durbin. Dr. Skop, please proceed.

 STATEMENT OF INGRID SKOP, M.D., BOARD-CERTIFIED OBSTETRICIAN-
   GYNECOLOGIST, AND VICE PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR OF MEDICAL 
    AFFAIRS, CHARLOTTE LOZIER INSTITUTE, SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS

    Dr. Skop. Thank you, Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member 
Graham, and Members of the Committee.
    As you've heard, I am Dr. Ingrid Skop, a board-certified 
obstetrician-gynecologist practicing in Texas for over 30 
years. Today, I advocate for both of my patients, a woman and 
her unborn child. Every successful abortion ends the life of 
one of my patients and often harms the other, as well.
    In the coming legislative session, Senator Graham will 
likely reintroduce Federal minimum protections limiting 
elective abortion after 15 weeks gestation, with exceptions for 
rape, incest, and the life and health of the mother. 
Conversely, Senator Baldwin has reintroduced the Women's Health 
Protection Act, which, ironically, does nothing to protect the 
health of a pregnant woman from a dangerous abortion. The 
unborn human life is never acknowledged. And abortion is 
presented as procedurally and morally equivalent to a vasectomy 
or a colonoscopy.
    This proposed legislation insists that there can be no 
commonsense safeguards to protect a woman. The words 
``choice,'' ``voluntary,'' and ``consent'' are completely 
missing, opening the door to others who will benefit from 
abortion--sex traffickers, incestuous abusers, and unwilling 
fathers. An abortion provider is not required to be a physician 
or even medically licensed. Despite its euphemistic name, the 
Women's Health Protection Act prioritizes the death of the 
unborn human at the expense of the health, or even the desires, 
of a pregnant woman.
    A woman and her unborn child are not natural enemies. Most 
pregnancies end in delivery of a healthy baby to a healthy 
mother. Media sources have misinformed the public, alleging 
that abortion limits will prevent an obstetrician from 
providing necessary medical care, increasing maternal 
mortality, but this is not true. Every legal restriction 
protecting unborn life allows a physician to use his reasonable 
medical judgment, that is, to follow the standard of care to 
determine when to intervene in a medical emergency.
    Let's compare how second-trimester limitations versus 
unlimited abortion throughout pregnancy will actually impact 
American women. Ninety percent of abortions in the second half 
of pregnancy are obtained for the same reasons as early 
abortions: social and financial concerns. Additionally, there 
are other important factors: coercion and indecision. Nine 
months is a long time for a woman who desires her child to say 
no to a coercive partner.
    Decisional uncertainty leaves a woman likely to regret 
aborting a baby whose kicks she can feel and with whom she has 
begun to bond. The physical risk of abortion increase as 
pregnancy progresses. The risk of maternal death is 76 times 
higher in the second half of pregnancy, compared to an early 
abortion.
    The dilation and evacuation procedure used for most later 
abortions involves forcing open a strong muscular cervix and 
blind insertion of sharp instruments to dismember and extract a 
struggling fetus, and may cause hemorrhage, cervical damage, 
retained tissue, and uterine perforation. Mental health 
complications, including anxiety, depression, suicide, and 
substance and alcohol abuse, are higher after abortion, 
particularly after late or coerced abortions, or if there are 
preexisting mental health issues.
    European records linkage studies document a woman has six 
times the risk of suicide in the year following an abortion, 
compared to childbirth. Unfortunately, the U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control does not even attempt to link mental health 
deaths to abortion in its dramatically incomplete maternal 
mortality data. Americans intuitively recognize these risks, as 
three-quarters support a limitation at 15 weeks, and only 1 in 
10 support abortion without gestational limits.
    Extremely late abortions are sometimes performed by labor 
induction because the fetus has grown too large to easily 
dismember. European studies document over half of babies 
survive induction abortion. And 69 percent of U.S. late-term 
abortionists report they do not routinely kill the fetus first, 
so it is likely that many babies survive late abortions and 
then are passively or actively killed. Infanticide used to be a 
red line, but no longer, as legislative protection for these 
unfortunate children has repeatedly been rejected.
    Fetal neurologic research documents that the pathways 
required for pain perception are in place by 15 weeks 
gestation. And during an abortion, the fetus displays all the 
responses that we, too, would exhibit if we were torn limb from 
limb. I have cared for many tiny babies, delivered at the edge 
of viability, around 22 weeks. Their precious faces express 
pain when their fragile bodies undergo therapeutic procedures.
    Fetal surgery as early as 15 weeks can be performed to heal 
some neurologic and vascular disorders before birth. Of course, 
these babies are always offered pain relief. How can we justify 
painful dismemberment of unborn babies at similar gestational 
ages just because we cannot hear their cries? Thank you.

 STATEMENT OF MICHELE GOODWIN, CHANCELLOR'S PROFESSOR OF LAW, 
    UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE SCHOOL OF LAW, ABRAHAM 
    PINANSKI VISITING PROFESSOR OF LAW, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, 
                    CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS

    Professor Goodwin. Committee Chairman Durbin, Committee 
Ranking Member Graham, and distinguished Members of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, my name is Michele Goodwin, and I am a 
chancellor's professor at the University of California, Irvine, 
and the Abraham Pinanski Visiting Professor at Harvard Law 
School.
    In its 2021-2022 term, the United States Supreme Court 
decisively undercut stare decisis and the rule of law when it 
overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.
    In doing so, the Supreme Court unleashed a torrent of 
unnecessary uncertainty--fear about the future of protections 
for women's health and their rights to life, liberty, and 
safety. Justice Thomas' concurring opinion placed all privacy 
rights on a high alert, save for interracial marriage, a status 
enjoyed by the Justice himself. For all other privacy rights, 
including marriage equality, access to contraception, freedom 
from State-imposed sterilization, and more, his concurrence 
remains a cause for serious alarm.
    Despite the promised protections articulated by the 
majority and Justice Kavanaugh, that freedom of travel would be 
preserved and that its dismantling of Roe would return abortion 
rights to the States, today, some legislatures are seeking to 
dispossess citizens of access to the ballot, whether by 
enacting provisions, making it more difficult to vote, or 
engaging in efforts to rewrite States' laws related to ballot 
initiatives and referenda, thereby introducing anti-democratic 
principles into the democratic process itself.
    The post-Dobbs era exposes not only a cruel disregard for 
the lives of those most affected, but also a lack of regard for 
constitutional law and foundational principles and values, such 
as freedom of movement, freedom of speech, freedom of 
association, privacy, and separation of church and state.
    In the aftermath of Dobbs, women, girls, and people with 
the capacity for pregnancy, are more at risk of State-level 
criminal and civil surveillance than before, whether in the 
effort to track their menstruation and travel.
    The Bill of Rights, once proudly championed by our 
Government because it protected speech, because it protected 
bodily privacy, because it protected freedom from Government 
overreach, including cruel and unusual punishment--it, too, now 
is vulnerable.
    Understandably, women and girls who do not wish to become 
pregnant, are not prepared for motherhood, or whose health is 
placed at risk by pregnancy and miscarriage, are horrified--
absolutely horrified--about credible present dangers and those 
that lurk ahead.
    The United States bears the worrying, worrying distinction 
as, quote, ``the deadliest nation in the industrialized or 
developed world to be pregnant.'' This is what barbarism looks 
like. This is what cruelty looks like. Nationwide, as noted by 
Justice Breyer, childbirth is 14 times more likely than 
abortion to result in death. I'll repeat that. Childbirth is 14 
times more likely to result in death than by abortion. As 
reported by Nina Martin and Renee Montagne, more American women 
are dying of pregnancy-related complications than any other 
developed country.
    In fact, only in the U.S. has the rate of women who die 
during pregnancy risen. As research from the Texas Observer 
shows, and my prior scholarship explains, this trend maps with 
the destructive anti-abortion legislating and dismantling that 
has gone on in our country exacerbated between 2010 and 2013, 
and now in just rapid exhilaration. More recently, data show 
that the U.S. maternal mortality crisis has worsened in the 
period overlapping with COVID-19 and, as well, in the period 
since Dobbs itself. Today, you'll hear more about these matters 
from me.
    Let me just say that, as I close, this period of time since 
Dobbs has unleashed criminal actions against women and their 
doctors. It has also unleashed civil surveillance, the type of 
which includes, in Nebraska, a mother and her daughter being 
criminally pursued. In Texas, doctors facing a $100,000 fine 
and 99 years' incarceration, should they try to help a patient 
terminate a pregnancy. In Louisiana, a woman being forced to 
gestate a fetus that had no skull development. In Wisconsin, a 
woman needing to bleed nearly to death before her doctors could 
intervene.
    And as you mentioned, Senator Durbin, right after Dobbs, 
the case of a 10-year-old girl having to flee Ohio to get to 
the State of Indiana in order to terminate a pregnancy due to 
rape. Thank you so much.

STATEMENT OF MONIQUE C. WUBBENHORST, M.D., MPH, SENIOR RESEARCH 
ASSOCIATE, DE NICOLA CENTER FOR ETHICS AND CULTURE, UNIVERSITY 
               OF NOTRE DAME, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA

    Dr. Wubbenhorst. Chair Durbin, Ranking Member Graham, and 
Members of the Committee, thank you for your invitation and the 
opportunity to testify at this hearing.
    My name is Dr. Monique Wubbenhorst. I am a practicing 
board-certified OB-GYN with more than 30 years' experience in 
patient care, teaching, research, health policy, and global 
health.
    I'd like to begin by noting that the Dobbs decision 
presents an opportunity to mitigate abortion's many harms to 
women, unborn children, families, and community.
    Abortion not only poses risks to the mother; it is also, by 
definition, always lethal to an embryo or fetus, an unborn 
child, who is a human being, a member of the human family, not 
a clump of cells or a potential child, but a child assuming the 
human form. Abortion's goal is to kill that human being. It 
neither treats, palliates, or prevents any disease, and is 
therefore not healthcare. This is reinforced by the fact that 
the majority of OB-GYNs do not perform abortions.
    Studies show that the percentage that do is declining and 
has been for decades, from a high of 40 percent in 1985 to 
between 7 and 24 percent at present. Given this, abortion 
cannot be considered essential healthcare for women. And if 
abortion is healthcare, my question is, what disease are you 
treating? Clinicians caring for pregnant women have two 
patients. Advancements in technology have allowed us to 
recognize the fetus as the patient within the patient.
    If the unborn child was not human, this investment in 
research and clinical care would not have occurred, but that 
view changes only if the same child is unwanted by his or her 
mother. And the current emphasis on dilation and evacuation in 
the second trimester really arises from a eugenic view of 
abortion. It's a recognition of the--it's an admission that the 
fetus is not truly a human being and ignores the fact that 
fetuses do experience pain at earlier gestational ages.
    Most abortions are elective. The bar for safety should be 
very high. And there is evidence that the safety of both 
medical and surgical abortion is overstated. As noted earlier 
by my colleague, the risks of abortion increased dramatically. 
Bartlett, et al., from 2004, found that the risk of a woman 
dying from abortion, not experiencing complications but dying, 
increased 38 percent for each week of gestational age. 
Abortions performed past 21 weeks had a mortality rate 76 times 
greater than abortions done in the first trimester.
    Abortion does not prevent pregnancy complications or reduce 
maternal mortality. A woman's individual risk for pregnancy 
complications such as diabetes, even mortality, is estimated, 
but cannot be predicted with certainty. There's no way to 
predict whether an individual woman will suffer a pregnancy 
complication, and any presumed effect of abortion on maternal 
mortality is speculative and based on statistical sleight of 
hand. It does not address causes of maternal mortality, in 
particular, cardiovascular disease and infection.
    The women in the United States who are at the highest risk 
for adverse pregnancy outcomes, mostly African-American women, 
are in fact, from the eugenic viewpoint, the unfit. The early 
eugenicists made similar arguments, proposing contraception and 
sterilization as solutions to medical and public health 
problems. Therefore, we must consider that the effect of public 
health measures and medical treatment, patient education that 
are needed to improve maternal outcomes, are the real answer to 
maternal mortality, not abortion.
    For pregnancies where serious complications occur, early 
delivery of the unborn child may be necessary, but such a 
delivery is not an abortion because its goal is to save the 
life of the mother and the life of the fetus if possible. This 
is ethically permissible. As in law, in medicine, intent is 
paramount. Premature delivery is not induced abortion, 
according to the American Association for Pro-Life OB-GYNs.
    And the Dublin Declaration upholds that there is a 
fundamental difference between abortion and necessary medical 
treatments that are carried out to save the life of the mother, 
even if such treatments result in the loss of her unborn child.
    Since Roe v. Wade, an estimated 17 million unborn African 
Americans have been aborted in the United States, which is more 
than the populations of the countries of Senegal and Cambodia, 
respectively, and slightly less than the entire population of 
the Netherlands.
    This means the deaths of not only the 17 million Black 
people who were aborted, but all their descendants, their 
families, hopes, and dreams. Annually, approximately 300,000 
Black women undergo abortion every year, while in 2021, there 
are approximately 518,000 births to Black women, a number that 
continues to decline.
    We must ask ourselves, how is this destruction of innocent 
life reproductive justice? How does one defend the deliberate 
killing of the most vulnerable members of a minority group, 
especially when births to that group have been, and continue to 
be, in decline? Rather than Black women achieving bodily 
autonomy and controlling their fertility, instead, their 
fertility is being controlled.
    There are substantial racial disparities in abortion rates, 
abortion mortality, and non-abortion-related maternal mortality 
between Black and white women. Thirty-eight percent of 
abortions occur in Black women, a rate which is two to three 
times higher than that of white women, even though we comprise 
only 12 to 14 percent of the total U.S. population. An 
estimated 684 Black children are aborted every day. African-
American women also have a two to three times higher mortality 
from abortion, compared with white women. Therefore, Black 
women have the highest rates of abortion and the highest rates 
of maternal mortality. Both of these facts cannot be true if 
abortion reduces maternal mortality.
    In conclusion, the medical, public health, and social 
landscape post-Dobbs offers many opportunities to help and 
support women to carry their unborn children to term. These 
include pregnancy resource centers, programs to improve 
maternal health, interventions to treat unborn children with 
disabilities, as well as perinatal hospice, and stronger civil 
society engagement in the mission of strengthening families.
    The pro-life message is one of profound hope and healing, 
of love and encouragement, of walking with women and parents 
and families through often difficult circumstances and helping 
them to thrive. Thank you for your invitation to this hearing. 
I look forward to your questions.

    Chair Durbin. Dr. Verma.

     STATEMENT OF NISHA VERMA, M.D., MPH, BOARD-CERTIFIED 
     OBSTETRICIAN-GYNECOLOGIST, AND FELLOW, PHYSICIANS FOR 
             REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, ATLANTA, GEORGIA

    Dr. Verma. Good morning, Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member 
Graham, and distinguished Members of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee.
    My name is Dr. Nisha Verma, and I am a board-certified, 
fellowship-trained obstetrician and gynecologist providing 
full-spectrum reproductive healthcare. That means I do 
everything from cancer screenings to delivering babies to 
supporting people as they decide to continue or end a 
pregnancy.
    I am a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, and 
I am also a proud Southerner. I was born and raised in North 
Carolina. I currently provide care in Georgia. And I have lived 
in the Southeast for most of my life. I decided to stay in 
Georgia after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional 
right to abortion care. And Georgia enacted a law that bans 
most abortions in our State last year.
    I decided to stay, knowing Georgia's law threatened to make 
me a criminal for providing life-saving care to my patients 
because I made a commitment when I became a doctor to serve my 
home and my community in the South. But every day, Georgia's 
law forces me to grapple with impossible situations where State 
laws directly violate the medical expertise I gained through 
years of training and the oath I took to provide the best care 
to my patients. Because of a law that is not based in medicine 
or science, I am forced to turn away patients that I know how 
to care for.
    I've had adolescents with chronic medical conditions that 
make their pregnancies very high risk, women with irregular 
periods who don't realize they're pregnant until after 6 weeks, 
and couples with highly desired pregnancies who receive a 
terrible diagnosis of a fetal anomaly, cry when they learn that 
they can't receive their abortion in our State and beg me to 
help them.
    Imagine looking someone in the eye and saying I have all 
the skills and the tools to care for you, but our State's 
politicians have told me I can't.
    Imagine having to tell someone you are sick, but not sick 
enough to receive care in our State, based on our law's very 
narrow exceptions.
    Abortion is extremely safe, and none of the arbitrary 
barriers imposed by politicians make it any safer. In fact, the 
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 
published a comprehensive study affirming the safety of 
abortion and pointed out that the biggest threat to patients is 
medically unnecessary restrictions.
    One of my patients--I'll call her M--gave me permission to 
share her story with you all today, and her experience brings 
the findings of this study to life. She struggled with 
infertility, and she and her husband were thrilled to see the 
positive pregnancy test after they transferred their final 
embryo. Then, at 17 weeks, when there was no chance of her baby 
ever developing lungs that would allow it to live outside of 
her, her water broke. She went to the hospital, but because her 
baby still had a heartbeat, her doctors couldn't do anything to 
help her.
    Instead, she had to wait to get sick, to start bleeding 
heavily, or develop an infection of her uterus that could 
spread into her bloodstream. M shared with me that, ``to be 
denied the basic medical care I needed, to be told that I must 
first be at risk of dying, to be forced to relive the trauma of 
losing my baby every day for 5 days because of Georgia's law, 
the trauma of that, on top of my loss, is devastating.'' She 
told me her baby's name was Ezekiel Charles, which means God's 
strength, and that she would miss him at every major and minor 
milestone he would have had in his life.
    I stayed in Georgia to provide care for people in my 
community, but my heart breaks every day for my patients like 
M, as I bear witness to the pain they have to carry because of 
these restrictions on abortion access.
    We know from recent data that already thousands of people 
have been forced to remain pregnant and have faced harm like 
developing serious medical conditions as a result.
    And we know that States with higher numbers of abortion 
restrictions are the same States with worse maternal health 
outcomes, with marginalized populations facing the largest 
burden. Already the U.S. has the highest maternal mortality 
rate of all high-income countries in the world, and data from 
the CDC shows us that this crisis is only worsening.
    I understand that abortion care can be a complicated issue 
for many people, just like so many aspects of health care and 
life can be. But I also know that abortion is necessary, 
compassionate, essential healthcare, and that my patients are 
capable of making complex, thoughtful decisions about their 
health and lives. No law should prevent them from doing so. I 
am unwavering in my commitment to support people in my home in 
the South.
    It shouldn't have to be this way. I urge you to listen to 
the stories of people who provide and access abortion care. I 
hope these stories help you understand that abortion care is 
not an isolated political issue, and to see how profoundly 
restrictions on abortion access harm all of our communities. 
Thank you for having me today, and I look forward to your 
questions.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Verma appears as a 
submission for the record.]
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Dr. Verma. Thank you, to all of 
the witnesses.
    Ms. Zurawski, I can't remember a testimony as compelling or 
as forceful as yours. I do this for a living. When I heard your 
story, as you presented it, I thought for a moment, what would 
I feel like if you were my daughter going through this?
    The joy of a possible grandchild that's been erased, and 
now you struggling to live, and an arbitrary political obstacle 
to saving your life. At some point, you had to be so sick and 
near death before they finally would agree to terminate the 
pregnancy.
    As you listen to the testimony from witnesses who share 
your feelings and don't, what was your reaction?
    Ms. Zurawski. It's a good question. It's very complicated. 
As Dr. Verma said, everything about abortion is complicated. I 
understand that. You know, it gives me a lot of hope to know 
that there are people like you and like some of my fellow 
witnesses who are fighting for safe and accessible healthcare. 
But it's also infuriating to know that there are people who 
think that what happened to me was okay and that it should have 
happened and that it should continue to happen.
    Chair Durbin. Once again, your answer is direct and has 
great meaning for me, personally, I hope, for others.
    I'd like to ask Dr. Skop a question. Based on your 
profession and medical expertise, with a reasonable degree of 
medical certainty, tell me when life begins.
    Dr. Skop. Ninety-six percent of biologists agree, and I 
agree--and this is scientifically proven--that life begins at 
the time the sperm fertilize an egg to create a zygote, which 
is the first stage in the process of human life.
    Chair Durbin. So, the termination of a pregnancy is the 
taking of life at any stage after the moment of conception?
    Dr. Skop. The legal definition of abortion is an action 
performed with the intent to end the unborn human life.
    Chair Durbin. So, is the answer in the affirmative?
    Dr. Skop. Yes, sir.
    Chair Durbin. Do you support Senator Graham's bill?
    Dr. Skop. I'm here today in the capacity as a clinician and 
as a researcher. And as I've stated in my testimony, I think 
there are many reasons to support Senator Graham's bill, based 
on the effects that late-term abortions have on women, which I 
have noted in my practice can be devastating----
    Chair Durbin. But----
    Dr. Skop [continuing]. Particularly the case that many of 
these women are coerced into these abortions.
    Chair Durbin. I'm not--I'm not at that level. I'm trying to 
stick to the original question. But it's my understanding that 
if you believe an abortion occurs when the pregnancy has ended, 
after the moment of conception, then the notion of his bill, 
limiting abortion to 15 weeks, suggests that would be the 
taking of a human life for 15 weeks after conception. Is that 
correct?
    Dr. Skop. I understand what you're saying. And there is a 
difference between what is politically feasible and what is 
morally defensible. And I think our country does need to have a 
conversation about the reasons that we are taking human life.
    Chair Durbin. In my mind, this gets to the heart of the 
issue and the debate. When does life begin? The debate has been 
going on for a long period of time, maybe from the beginning of 
civilization.
    I'm not sure I have the right answer. I'm not sure Dr. Skop 
has the right answer. We're trying to find a humane response.
    When I listen to Ms. Zurawski, I understand if you start 
from the moment of conception and say that she has to weather 
what she did, literally at the brink of losing her life before 
you could end that abortion, you have to ask yourself, what 
about the life of the mother? Is that a critical element too? I 
think it is.
    Professor Goodwin, you've talked about what women are going 
through now with data privacy and the possibility that they're 
going to be tracked, as to whether they visit an abortion 
clinic and penalized by their home State. Is that a 
possibility?
    Professor Goodwin. It is a possibility. And already in the 
State of Idaho, there is legislation moving forward to track 
whether people would leave the State and travel. What we see is 
the dismantling, the vulnerability of constitutional principles 
that date back centuries. And abortion is being used as a proxy 
to dismantle fundamental constitutional principles, including 
the right to travel.
    Chair Durbin. Dr. Wubbenhorst makes a point about the 
number of African-American women who are seeking abortions. 
Would you like to respond to that?
    Professor Goodwin. Yes, I would. Senator Durbin, in the 
State of Mississippi, a Black woman is 118 times more likely to 
die by carrying a pregnancy to term than by having an abortion. 
The State of Mississippi has notoriously been a death sentence 
for Black women, dating back to the time of slavery through Jim 
Crow and to the present. And if we don't thread that needle 
together, then there's a lot that we are missing.
    There is a reason why Black women in Mississippi have 
sought to be able to terminate pregnancies for their own bodily 
autonomy, for their own safety, for their own health. 
Mississippi is one of the deadliest places, not just in the 
country, to be pregnant, but it's one of the deadliest places 
in all of the industrialized world to be pregnant.
    And right now, as there are anti-abortion measures being 
spread through what was the U.S. Confederacy, what we see are 
the people who are most harmed were the people most harmed 
during American slavery and Jim Crow, too, and that happens to 
be Black women.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, professor. Senator Graham.
    Senator Graham. Thank you. A very interesting discussion, 
and I think we need to put it in context of where the world's 
at. Dr. Skop--is that right? Are you from Texas?
    Dr. Skop. I am from Texas.
    Senator Graham. Amanda's situation was terrible. How does--
what happened in Texas?
    Dr. Skop. You know, Amanda, I want to say I am so sorry at 
your loss of Willow, and I am so sorry that your doctors 
misunderstood Texas law. I've reviewed Texas law, of course, 
because I practice there, and I want to understand, as well as 
all of the other laws in the States. Every single law allows an 
exclusion for a doctor to use their reasonable medical judgment 
to determine when to intervene in a medical emergency, which is 
usually defined as a threat to the life of the mother or 
permanent irreversible damage to an organ or an organ system.
    None of the States have the terminology that the threat 
must be immediate. Doctors know, we, and obstetricians have 
always known, even prior to Dobbs, the Hyde Amendment has been 
in place since the late 1970s. And the Hyde Amendment allowed 
an exclusion for life of the mother. So doctors have been 
practicing. And I have not changed my practice in any way since 
the Dobbs decision.
    The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology--in 
regards to the horrible situation that Amanda found herself in, 
pre-viable, premature rupture of membranes, where the water bag 
breaks, but labor does not ensue and the baby is a long way 
from being able to live outside of the mother, the American 
College acknowledges that the risk of infection is high, which 
can become sepsis, which can threaten the mother's life. The 
likelihood that the baby can make it to an age in which it can 
live outside of the uterus is very low.
    And they tell us--and obstetricians do follow ACOG's 
recommendations for the standard of care. They tell us at the 
time of diagnosis that we should offer immediate termination of 
pregnancy, which they define as induction, or dilation and 
evacuation abortion, or expectant management. So, in a woman 
who is not currently infected and sick--I have had patients who 
have wanted to stay pregnant, in hopes that they could get the 
baby to a gestational age where it could live, but it has 
always been the standard of care, and continues to be the 
standard of care, to offer delivery at that time. Most of my 
patients have opted for induction rather than D&E because they 
wanted to have a baby to mourn, but either one could have been 
offered, and should have been offered, to Amanda.
    Senator Graham. Thank you. Fifteen weeks. Is it fair to say 
that a baby has a heartbeat at 15 weeks? Does anybody on the 
panel disagree with that? As a matter of fact, the baby has a 
heartbeat about 2 months before 15 weeks. Is that right, Dr. 
Skop?
    Dr. Skop. Twenty-three days after conception, there's a 
muscular chamber innervated by electrical impulses pumping 
blood cells which are oxygenated throughout the baby's body.
    Senator Graham. Does anybody disagree with what I said 
about the European standard, that 47 of 50 European nations 
limit elective abortion at 15 weeks or less? Does anybody 
disagree with that? Good.
    The bottom line is, 55,000 babies are aborted after 15 
weeks in the United States. Is that right, Dr. Wubbenhorst?
    Dr. Wubbenhorst. Yes, that's correct.
    [Poster is displayed.]
    Senator Graham. And most are elective, so this would 
matter. So I'm for my bill. I'm not asking you to be, Dr. Skop, 
but I'm for it. And let me tell you why I'm for it. I'd like 
America, at some point in time, to say, 15 weeks being pretty 
good to me, that a baby is well developed, can feel pain. You 
can't operate on the baby medically without anesthesia because 
the baby can feel pain in efforts to save its life, to draw a 
line.
    There's nothing unreasonable about trying to draw a line at 
15 weeks when 47 of 50 European nations do that, with 
exceptions for rape, incest, life of the mother. What's 
unreasonable is allow abortion on demand up to the moment of 
birth.
    That's exactly what your bill does. That puts you in the 
category of China and North Korea. I welcome this debate. We're 
not going to back off. We're going to try to have America in 
line with the civilized world, not North Korea and China. 
Nothing good comes from wholesale abortion on demand at 15 
weeks, when the baby can feel pain.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Whitehouse.
    Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Chairman. Welcome, to the 
witnesses. One of the things I noticed about the Dobbs decision 
was that in order to get where the Justices in favor of that 
decision wanted to go, they had to change the legal standard 
from a balancing of interests to history and tradition.
    In a balancing of interests, one of the interests is the 
interest of the woman involved in the procedure.
    In history and tradition, you go back to ancient history, 
before women had rights, like the right to vote, like the right 
to have credit without the permission of their husband.
    It looked like the rights of women were being deliberately 
removed from the equation by the Justices of the Supreme Court. 
And in that context, Ms. Zurawski, how did it feel to you? How 
did you feel that your rights, your interests, were being 
considered as you went through the experience that you had to?
    Ms. Zurawski. I felt I had absolutely no right to make a 
decision for my own body, for my own health, for the health of 
my child. You know, I thought about when my grandfather was in 
the hospital, similarly also had sepsis, and my dad and his 
siblings were making the decision on how he should receive 
healthcare and what kind of treatment he should receive.
    And what I couldn't understand in those 3 days, where I had 
to sit and wait to get healthcare, is how is it that my dad was 
able to make health care decisions for his dad, but I couldn't 
make my own health care decisions for myself and for the child 
that was inside me? I had no right, I had no opportunity, and 
neither did my healthcare team.
    Senator Whitehouse. In addition to changing the legal 
standard to get the result they wanted, the other thing that 
stuck out for me, in that decision, was Justice Alito's 
language, that Roe v. Wade--and I'll quote him here, ``was 
egregiously wrong from the start.'' So presumably, that means 
``the start,'' back in 1973.
    Well after that start, while Roe was egregiously wrong, 
Alito came before this Committee and he had the chance to tell 
us that he thought Roe was egregiously wrong, make that 
observation about that case, and instead, he hid that 
sentiment.
    He said, instead, ``Roe v. Wade is an important precedent 
of the Supreme Court. It was decided in 1973. So it has been on 
the books for a long time. It is a precedent that has been on 
the books for several decades. It has been challenged. It has 
been reaffirmed.'' No egregiously wrong, everything designed to 
reassure us that he was not going to overturn that decision.
    So looking back, he looks a lot like a sleeper agent 
predetermined to attack Roe, who wouldn't disclose what he was 
up to until he had the majority that he needed to change the 
legal standard and destroy the legal precedent. I think it's a 
very unfortunate episode in the Supreme Court's history.
    Dr. Verma, one of the groups I've heard the most from about 
this, in Rhode Island, has been OB-GYN doctors, who express 
real horror at what this means for their practice, particularly 
in circumstances where a pregnancy has begun to go wrong, where 
there are very difficult decisions that have to be made, that 
balance the life of one fetus against perhaps another, if it's 
twins, against risk to the mother.
    And in that context, they view these laws as forcing 
decisions, and disabling them from making decisions that are 
customary medical practice. Could you comment on that and what 
some of the circumstances are that you consider to be most 
dangerous with regard to these laws?
    Dr. Verma. Absolutely. Thank you for that question. I can 
tell you, as the OB-GYN on this panel who provides full-
spectrum care, including labor and delivery and abortion care, 
that these laws are creating huge amounts of confusion on the 
ground, and preventing people from accessing the healthcare 
that they need. We train for years and years to be able to look 
at the person in front of us and to make the best health care 
decisions with them and their families.
    And we're seeing that many people with high-risk 
pregnancies are not able to get the abortion care that they 
need. You've heard a couple of examples of people that break 
their water before the baby's able to survive outside of them. 
I also take care of people with medical conditions like really 
high blood pressure, where continuing the pregnancy puts them 
at risk for things like stroke and preeclampsia. We see people 
with peripartum cardiomyopathy, where the pregnancy causes 
their heart to enlarge and weaken. And the risk of having that 
happen again in another pregnancy is quite high.
    For all of these people, we're having to ask ourselves, how 
sick do they have to get to be able to intervene? Instead of 
just being able to provide the best medical care for the person 
in front of us, we're having to figure out, can I do this under 
the law? And that's creating huge amounts of confusion and 
absolutely preventing people from getting the care that they 
need.
    Senator Whitehouse. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to ask 
unanimous consent to let statements from some of Rhode Island's 
OB-GYN doctors be admitted into the record.
    Chair Durbin. Without objection.
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Chair Durbin. Senator Cornyn.
    Senator Cornyn. Dr. Skop, if I understood you correctly, 
you said that in your medical opinion that the way Amanda's 
doctor handled her pregnancy was a deviation of the standard of 
care in similar cases. Did I understand you correctly?
    Dr. Skop. Yes, sir. ACOG tells us on when it's appropriate 
to offer delivery.
    Senator Cornyn. Well back, many years ago, I used to handle 
medical malpractice cases. And usually, when a medical expert 
says that what a doctor did violated the standard of care, that 
gave rise to a cause of action for medical malpractice. I was 
just curious about that. So, this is an emotional and divisive 
issue. There's no doubt about it. That's a statement of the 
obvious.
    I appreciate, Dr. Skop, your pointing to the difference 
between what is moral, which is an individual decision people 
make about the appropriate conduct, and then what is possible, 
when it comes to building consensus, either among the American 
people or the people in a given State, or in the legislative 
branch. But I can pretty much guarantee that post-Roe v. Wade, 
now that that issue is back in the hands of the State 
legislatures, there is--it's highly unlikely there will be a 
Federal abortion standard. It requires 60 votes in the United 
States Senate, and as you can see, this is a very divisive 
issue.
    But I want to ask you again, Dr. Skop--I'm just going 
through the Women's Health Protection Act. This is what's been 
offered by Senator Baldwin and her Democratic colleagues, as an 
alternative to States determining what the abortion laws should 
be. First of all, can you tell us who Kermit Gosnell was?
    Dr. Skop. Yes. Kermit Gosnell was an obstetrician in inner 
city Philadelphia, who, for 17 years, his clinic was never 
inspected by the Pennsylvania State Department of Health. He 
was allowed to perform very unsupervised late-term abortions on 
unfortunate, poor, minority women and when--it was actually, I 
think, I believe a pill mill through which the State started 
investigating him. But it was determined that there were women 
who had died under his care, that his clinic was very squalid 
conditions.
    There was evidence that babies had been born alive, and 
then he committed infanticide. And he is currently serving time 
in prison. He's an example of what happens if we allow politics 
to keep us from supervising abortion providers, to make sure 
they're performing adequate care. And unfortunately, under this 
legislation, we may see more providers like that.
    Senator Cornyn. Well, there's a cottage industry here in 
Washington, DC, naming legislation in ways that are the 
opposite of how they actually function. I'm thinking of the 
Inflation Reduction Act, which didn't actually reduce 
inflation, for example, but this legislation that Senator 
Durbin and others are proposing is so-called the Women's Health 
Protection Act. If it were more accurately named, it seems to 
me it might be the Kermit Gosnell tribute act, because it would 
eliminate all restrictions, at the State or Federal level, on 
access to abortion.
    The bill text says, ``It supersedes and applies to all 
Federal and State laws and that no law in conflict with this 
shall be enforced.'' It allows the access to abortion through 
all 9 months of pregnancy, including late-term abortions. It 
doesn't speak to infanticide, but we can imagine what would 
come next.
    The Hyde Amendment, which you alluded to, which has 
provided for many years now, since the 1970s, that no tax 
funds, no taxpayer funds should be used--could be used to fund 
abortion, would be overruled.
    All parental consent and parental notification laws--if 
your child became--adolescent child became pregnant, you would 
have no right to know of their seeking access to abortion, or, 
certainly, no right to consent. If someone wanted to get an 
abortion because they had a female baby, and they wanted a male 
child, this law would--this proposed law would overrule that 
restriction and allow sex-selection abortion. I could go on and 
on and on, but I don't believe that the proposal that Senator 
Durbin and his Democratic colleagues have made represents the 
consensus in this country.
    We all have a right to our own moral judgments, but when it 
comes to the laws of the land, no one has a right to impose 
their personal views on everyone else, which is what Roe v. 
Wade did. The Supreme Court took that out of the discussion 
among the American people, or the halls of Congress, or the 
State legislators, and said that you could not pass a law 
regardless of where the consensus was, effectively allowing 
abortion on demand through--till the time of delivery.
    So we need to solve this problem, but we're not going to 
solve it in Congress. This is going to--this is now being 
debated, should be debated and be resolved in the State 
legislatures around the country. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Since Senator from Texas mentioned my name 
several times, I'd like to make a point for the record.
    In 2013, Dr. Kermit Gosnell, a physician in Pennsylvania, 
was found guilty on three charges of infanticide, murdering 
babies born alive in his clinic after botched late-term 
abortions. Gosnell was also found guilty of involuntary 
manslaughter and the death of a woman who was undergoing an 
abortion in his care.
    He was sentenced to life in prison, without the possibility 
of parole. I might remind the Senator this happened while Roe 
v. Wade was the law of the land. To suggest that it somehow 
would absolve that kind of conduct is just plain wrong.
    Senator Cornyn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You don't need to 
remind me.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Klobuchar.
    Senator Klobuchar. Ms. Zurawski, thank you for sharing your 
difficult story with all of us today. As you know, nearly half 
the States in the country have now enacted restrictions, or are 
moving toward bans. Twelve States are enforcing near-total bans 
on abortion.
    In your testimony, you say that traveling to another State 
for care was not an option for you because you would have had 
to drive 8 hours and risk, what you called, the death sentence 
of developing sepsis, which can kill quickly in the middle of 
the West Texas desert or 30,000 feet above the ground. What do 
you want people to know about the risk that bans, and 
restrictions placed on women experiencing miscarriages?
    Ms. Zurawski. Thank you for that question. So first, I'd 
like to revisit something that Senator Cornyn brought up in Dr. 
Skop's response because I'd like to make it clear that Dr. Skop 
is not my physician. She has never been my physician. She has 
never treated me. She has not seen my medical records.
    Quite frankly, my physician and my team of healthcare 
professionals that I saw over the course of 3 days, while I was 
repeatedly turned away from healthcare access, made the 
decision to not provide an abortion because that's what they 
felt they had to do under Texas law. And that will continue to 
happen. And it is continuing to happen. And it's not a result 
of misinterpretation. It's a result of confusion.
    And the confusion is because the way the law is written, 
the language in the law is incredibly vague. And it leaves 
doctors grappling with what they can and cannot do, what 
healthcare they can and cannot provide. And if they make the 
wrong decision, they face up to 99 years in prison and/or 
losing their license.
    And in my opinion, that was intentional because after the 
Dobbs decision, the administration put out guidance for when an 
abortion can and cannot be, or should or should not be 
provided. And the State attorney general in Texas, Ken Paxton, 
hated that so much that he sued the Government to overturn 
those guidelines. And so, what happened to me is exactly what 
he wanted to happen.
    Senator Klobuchar. And your point is that right now we have 
a patchwork of laws across this country. And if we would enact 
some Federal standards here and codify Roe v. Wade into law, 
which was a law of land before this, this wouldn't have 
happened to you?
    Ms. Zurawski. That's right.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Thank you. Dr. Verma, how do the 
medical consequences of delaying care impact women?
    Dr. Verma. They impact women significantly. We are seeing--
I am practicing in Georgia, where we have a 6-week ban in 
place. And we're having to turn away patients for all kinds of 
reasons: people that have irregular periods that don't realize 
they're pregnant until after 6 weeks; people that are 
diagnosed--their babies are diagnosed with terrible fetal 
anomalies on their 20-week ultrasound; people that develop 
worsening medical conditions during their pregnancies.
    And because they can't access their care in our State, even 
though their doctors are trained to provide that care, they're 
having to figure out if they can go out of State, get the 
resources together, take time off work, figure out childcare.
    Senator Klobuchar. What impact would a national ban on 
mifepristone have on your ability to care for your patients?
    Dr. Verma. It would have a devastating impact on our 
ability to care for our patients. We know, based on decades of 
evidence, that mifepristone is incredibly safe and effective 
and can be used in combination with misoprostol for both 
medication abortion and management of miscarriages. It's an 
incredibly important treatment for our patients to have 
available to them.
    Senator Klobuchar. You know, since Dobbs, States like 
Minnesota and Illinois have become islands of care in the 
middle of the country. We are the States that are the islands 
of care. In 2022, Whole Woman's Health of Minnesota and 
Bloomington saw the percentage of out-of-state patients that 
they treated increase to more than double the numbers in 2019. 
Since Dobbs, have you seen influxes in patients going between 
States to access care?
    Dr. Verma. Absolutely. We're seeing patients trying to get 
out of State to get the care that they need, although we also 
know that many people are not able to do that and are being 
forced to continue pregnancies that put their health at risk, 
that are being forced to deliver because they don't have the 
resources to get out of State.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Thank you. I'm going to ask one 
question, in my remaining time of you, Professor Goodwin. One 
judge in Amarillo and two on the Fifth Circuit would have 
entered an injunction, setting limits, saying you cannot 
receive mifepristone by mail. You can't get it over the counter 
in the pharmacy, that they're going to have it be available, 
not in up to 10 weeks, but 7 weeks instead.
    And as you know, that's currently on hold. And one of the 
things the Justice Department argued was that the doctors who 
brought this case--unlike the American Medical Association, 
that's made it very clear that this drug is safe, and it's been 
used in 60 countries, over 23 years in America. The Department 
of Justice--those few doctors that brought this case argued 
that the Department of Justice said they should not be able to 
sue because they hadn't been impacted by the approval of 
mifepristone, and they were not going to be impacted in the 
future, unlike someone, say, that we've just heard from, Ms. 
Zurawski.
    So, I thought this was interesting because, as you know, 
Justice Scalia has made similar comments to this, where he 
rejected a lawsuit, saying it would make a mockery of our prior 
cases. That basically, you wouldn't have the standing to bring 
a case when you haven't had harm or expect to have harm. 
Quickly, do you want to comment on that and what----
    Professor Goodwin. Well----
    Senator Klobuchar [continuing]. Standing really means and 
why this case should fall on the standing of those that brought 
it?
    Professor Goodwin. The case itself was absurdist. What the 
petitioners claimed was that the FDA had rushed to judgment 
with approving this drug. That drug spent over 54 months of 
review--2000 it came into the marketplace. Other drugs that 
were approved, in that same period, had spent 15 months of 
review. What we know is that it's safe. It's a drug that had 
already been used in Europe. And in 23 years, since it was 
approved in the United States, we know that the safety of 
mifepristone is--that it's far safer than penicillin, Tylenol, 
even Viagra.
    The claims that somehow these petitioners, including a 
dentist, will somehow be overwhelmed with patients who have 
used mifepristone but who will seek their care, is truly 
absurdist. Because in 23 years, that has not happened. That has 
not been the experience of the petitioners at all. And it is 
worth noting that this was a form of forum shopping, looking 
for a very specific judge who had already articulated anti-
abortion views and placing a petition before that specific 
judge.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Senator Grassley.
    Senator Grassley. Dr. Wubbenhorst, could you explain how 
women can still receive compassionate and necessary medical 
treatment from pregnancy complications without their provider 
performing an abortion?
    Dr. Wubbenhorst. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question. I 
think that, as I said earlier in my testimony, when women 
experience complications--and in my career, I have had 
literally hundreds of women, both here and in other countries, 
have complications requiring delivery. When you are performing 
a procedure to save the life of the mother, it is not morally 
considered an abortion, and therefore, it is ethically 
permissible. Compassionate care means that you consider the 
circumstances carefully, you act in the best interest of both 
patients.
    If the death of the unborn child is a result of your 
intervention, that is a tragic outcome, but nonetheless, our 
priority is to save the life of the mother and preserve her 
functioning. And that can be accomplished without performing an 
abortion.
    Senator Grassley. Dr. Skop, there's been discussion of 
long-term health impacts of complications from pregnancy. Data 
suggests that both chemical and surgical abortions can cause 
adverse and life-threatening health impacts. Can you briefly 
explain and discuss the possible complications and impact on 
health of women that can arise from abortions, including 
surgical abortions, or the use of the abortion pill?
    Dr. Skop. Yes, sir. Thank you for that question. So, in my 
30 years practicing caring for women, I've cared for many women 
who have been harmed by abortion. I've cared for a woman who 
died of a second-trimester abortion from sepsis. I have--in my 
practice, another young girl died from sepsis after a first-
trimester surgical abortion in which her uterus had been 
perforated. I've cared for many, many women who have explained 
to me that their anxiety and depression is due to their 
unresolved guilt over an abortion.
    I trust those women to tell me what the cause of their 
concerns are. I've seen women who self-harm. I've seen women 
who turn to substance and alcohol use and abuse due to this 
guilt that they have regarding chemical abortion.
    And I would like to state that, so that everyone is aware, 
the United States does not have any Federal mandates to report 
any data about abortion. We do not know how many abortions 
occur. We do not know the complications. And we certainly don't 
know the deaths because, as I reported, it's well known that 
mental health deaths can follow abortion. And our CDC does not 
try to make that linkage at all. Countries that have made this 
linkage have documented far higher mental health deaths in the 
year following abortion, compared to childbirth, including six 
times as many suicidesy.
    But regarding chemical abortion, the industry tells us it's 
safer than Tylenol. They're comparing Tylenol-overdose deaths 
to the undercounted deaths from chemical abortion. There's no 
comparison. Women assume they mean normal Tylenol use. They 
don't realize that they're comparing it to deaths that happen 
from overdoses. The abortion industry tells us about the 
complications they know about, but my experience has been, 
because the women have been assured it is so safe, when they 
have a complication, they do not return to the abortion 
provider. They come to me, as their gynecologist, or they come 
to the emergency room in distress.
    And so, when we look at good quality records, linkage 
studies that detect all chemical abortions and all subsequent 
events, we find 5 to 6 percent of these women present to an 
emergency room within a month. Approximately the same number 
will require surgery because their bodies cannot evacuate all 
of the dead tissue.
    And I am still hearing--for these complications in Texas, 
even though we've had abortion limitations for quite some time, 
because these drugs are circulating in the State to try to 
circumvent our State laws and provide abortions to these 
unfortunate women.
    Senator Grassley. Dr. Wubbenhorst, in your opinion, how can 
we approach reducing mortality rates from pregnant women? And 
you might also touch on the fact that, why is unrestricted 
abortion not a solution to this issue?
    Dr. Wubbenhorst. Thank you for the question. The solution 
to maternal mortality--and I've been working in this area 
globally and in the United States for many years--is to improve 
health care, health education, and to increase support to 
pregnant women. Abortion does nothing to address any of those 
issues. The main causes of maternal mortality have been for 
years, and in the most recent CDC data from 2021, are deaths 
from cardiovascular causes, infection, embolism, and so on and 
so forth. Abortion will not reduce those deaths.
    There is no argument and no paper anywhere that shows that 
abortion reduces maternal mortality. There are studies that 
purport to do so, but when you look at the essence of the 
studies, what they're saying is that, well, if you reduce the 
number of women at risk by performing abortions in them, that 
somehow reduces the number of mortalities.
    In point of fact, we cannot predict exactly who will have a 
poor outcome. We cannot predict who will have an adverse 
maternity outcome. And so, that asks the question, what percent 
of high-risk pregnancies should we abort? Twenty percent? 
Thirty percent? Forty percent? I think the other issue really 
relates to community and civil society engagement in terms of 
helping women to have better outcomes for their pregnancies.
    Senator Grassley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Blumenthal.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, all, 
for being here today. And I want to begin by thanking Ms. 
Zurawski, particularly, for your courage and sharing your story 
today, but also, Dr. Verma, to you and all the OB-GYNs, all the 
healthcare providers, the nurses, the escorts who are at 
clinics around the country, providing protection and care in 
the face of the danger--real, physical, as well as emotional 
jeopardy inflicted on them, I think you are a profile in 
courage, as well.
    In Connecticut, we now have laws, thanks to our State 
legislature, that help to protect women in other States because 
we guarantee these rights in Connecticut. But in other States, 
they come to Connecticut to exercise reproductive rights 
because of those dangers that you face every day in Georgia.
    When I first introduced the Women's Health Protection Act 
10 years ago, the idea that Roe v. Wade would be overruled, in 
fact, was unthinkable because it was well-established 
precedent. It was long accepted under the principle of stare 
decisis.
    And three nominees came to this room to be confirmed before 
our Committee and agreed that it was long-established 
precedent. And under that doctrine of stare decisis, they could 
not see how it would be overruled. They didn't refer to that 
case. They made no promises, but they led us to believe that 
they believed that the integrity of Supreme Court precedent 
should be respected. I think the best way to refer to their 
testimony here--and I'm talking about Justices Gorsuch, Coney 
Barrett, and Kavanaugh--is that it was disingenuous.
    And I think a number of my colleagues would agree. Senator 
Whitehouse referred earlier to testimony from another Justice, 
who perhaps had in mind the same result, despite Supreme Court 
precedent, that is Justice Scalia. And their concluding, as 
they did in Dobbs, that Roe v. Wade was wrong--with barely a 
few years after they established their respect for it--I think 
has helped to undermine the integrity and credibility of the 
Court.
    I would like to ask you about, not the legal issues here, 
Dr. Verma, but, in hearing some of what has been said about the 
medicine, about the healthcare issues, whether you would like 
to correct some of what has been said here, and just give you 
the opportunity to respond. Because I trust women to make these 
decisions, not politicians or judges or Senators. And I want to 
know what women should know from you in the face of what I 
think has been some disinformation here, medically.
    Dr. Verma. Absolutely. And thank you, Senator, for that 
opportunity. So I want to start by saying that the American 
College of OB-GYNs, which represents over 60,000 OB-GYNs across 
the country, along with over 75 other major science-based 
medical societies, have identified abortion care as incredibly 
safe, essential healthcare.
    This is not one profession. This is not one society. This 
includes the American Medical Association, the American Academy 
of Family Physicians, of Pediatrics, of Surgery, of Anesthesia.
    This is--the science on this is settled. Abortion care is 
incredibly safe, essential healthcare. This is the consensus of 
the science-based, evidence-based medical community.
    In addition, the American Board of OB-GYNs, which is the 
board that certifies all of us OB-GYNs at this table, has 
identified abortion care as incredibly safe, essential 
healthcare, with risk of serious, major complications of less 
than 1 percent and has actually said that misinformation about 
abortion--spreading misinformation about abortion is medical 
unprofessionalism.
    In addition, we heard some people bring up Kermit Gosnell. 
What he did was terrible. To say that that represents the 
reality of abortion care in this country does a disservice to 
me, my colleagues, and my patients. I see my patients accessing 
abortion care from a place of compassion every day, compassion 
for themselves, their existing families, their children.
    When we see a patient, we give them all of their options, 
that includes talking to them about adoption, continuing the 
pregnancy, and abortion, and confirm that they are completely 
sure before moving forward. And we provide them with abortion 
care in a safe, compassionate way. If someone chooses to 
continue a pregnancy, I'm also very happy to support them in 
that and deliver their baby.
    I do all of OB-GYN. I think that focusing on people have 
experiencing regret does a disservice to our patients, who are 
making these informed decisions about their health care and 
lives, and are experts on their own lives. We also have 
excellent data from the Turnaway Study, which followed 1,000 
women for over 5 years----
    [Gavel is tapped.]
    Dr. Verma [continuing]. And showed that the most common 
emotion after an abortion was relief.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you, very much. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Blumenthal. Next is Senator 
Lee.
    Senator Lee. From time to time, the Supreme Court corrects 
prior errors. It happened with Plessy v. Ferguson, which was a 
bad decision. We've all acknowledged that that, along with Dred 
Scott, along with Korematsu, are bad decisions. I like it when 
the Supreme Court is able to correct prior errors. That is what 
occurred with Dobbs. Dobbs corrected a prior error.
    It's difficult to endure hearing people say that they're 
worried about the credibility of the Court when sometimes those 
words are uttered by people who are themselves actively, 
willfully, deliberately attacking the credibility of the Court, 
sometimes as officers of the Court. We're seeing this through 
unfair attacks on Justice Thomas and other members of the U.S. 
Supreme Court, and it's got to stop. Look, Dobbs was right.
    As a matter of constitutional law, this is a matter, not 
for this Court's to decide, but for elected lawmakers, 
typically in State legislatures, not our national legislature. 
So, if you don't like the policy outcome, go to your State 
legislature, but this is not an issue in which the Federal 
judiciary is somehow empowered. There is no reproductive rights 
clause of the U.S. Constitution. So let's not pretend that 
we're worried about the credibility of the Court if we are 
simultaneously attacking the credibility of the Court and its 
ability to do its job.
    Now, a lot of these issues relate to this legislation 
that's been introduced in the wake of the Dobbs decision, which 
is itself way more radical, even than Roe v. Wade was, and way 
more radical than where Americans are comfortable going. You 
know, 69 percent of Americans are uncomfortable with abortion 
after the first trimester, 69 percent. But you'd never guess 
that from the way Democrats in the United States Senate vote on 
these issues, where essentially, all of them support, or appear 
to be comfortable with, second- and third-trimester abortions.
    In fact, all but, I think, two Members of the Democratic 
caucus in the United States Senate voted against the Born-Alive 
Abortion Survivors Act. And so, this legislation Democrats are 
now pushing would prohibit any State law from regulating 
abortion within a State's borders, essentially ever, not to 
protect girls, not to protect women, not to protect health, 
safety, and welfare, not to protect the rights of a baby born 
alive.
    Now, putting aside for a moment the life of the child, when 
considering the health impact of abortion on women, I think 
there are important considerations to make.
    Dr. Ingrid, I'd like--Dr. Skop, I'd like to start with you. 
What concerns do you have for the physical and mental well-
being of women who have late-term abortions?
    Dr. Skop. It's well established that women who have late-
term abortions are at much higher risk for mental health 
complications, as we mentioned, anxiety, depression, substance 
use and abuse, and suicidal ideation and self-harm.
    Senator Lee. Let's talk about suicide for a minute. Those 
who have second- or third-trimester abortions, late-term 
abortions, do they have--what do their higher suicides look 
like?
    Dr. Skop. In the United States, we do not have data on this 
because, as I mentioned, it's--backing up to maternal 
mortality, this is--data is collected until a full year after 
the end of the pregnancy. And it is virtually impossible 
because the CDC mostly looks at death certificates. It's 
virtually impossible to link, say, a coerced abortion----
    Senator Lee. To the causation.
    Dr. Skop [continuing]. And a suicide 6 months later----
    Senator Lee. Right, right.
    Dr. Skop [continuing]. And I don't think that there are 
many efforts to do this.
    Senator Lee. By the way, how many, how many abortions are 
medically indicated, medically necessary?
    Dr. Skop. Using the definition that the intent is to kill 
the baby, I would say none. As we discussed earlier, 
occasionally, there is the need to do a separation of the 
mother and the baby. The intent in that case is to save the 
mother, and that sometimes the baby regrettably dies, but even 
if you use that death, or if you said that, well, that counts 
as an abortion, it's still far less than 1 percent of the 
abortions in our country.
    Senator Lee. Very good to know. Now if, as you have noted, 
women are four times more likely to experience serious medical 
complications from a chemical abortion as a surgical abortion, 
why is the abortion industry pushing chemical abortion? Does it 
have more to do with the fact that it's an industry that makes 
a lot of money off of that?
    Or does it have more to do with the fact that that 
dispenses with a lot of inconvenient things, like the fact that 
we've got Planned Parenthood clinics that have been caught on 
tape telling girls not to tell the age of the person having the 
abortion because then they would have a duty to report it? What 
is that? What's causing that?
    Dr. Skop. I think there are definitely advantages for the 
abortion industry to promote chemical abortions. They don't 
have to hire a surgeon, pay for sterilization of instruments, 
and the costs that go along with that. And the reality I would 
like to acknowledge is that, again, about 90 percent of 
obstetricians do not perform abortions.
    And even obstetricians who claim to be pro-choice, many of 
them will not perform surgical abortions. So I think there was 
a staffing issue that began the promotion toward chemical 
abortion. There may be some advantages in terms of funding, but 
now that we see----
    Senator Lee. Is there a profit motive perhaps? Could that--
--
    Dr. Skop. There was a time that the cost of a surgical 
abortion and a chemical abortion were approximately the same, 
an average of about $575, but I think we also see, in light of 
States beginning to have pro-life restrictions, that this is a 
way to get around those restrictions and provide abortions in 
States that are trying to protect unborn life.
    Senator Lee. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I see my 
time has expired.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Hirono.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Skop says that 
Ms. Zurawski's doctors misinterpreted Texas law which 
criminalizes abortion. So, her doctors were acting under advice 
of the hospital's ethics committee, which includes lawyers. So 
to suggest that doctors should ignore the advice and the 
cautions of their own ethics committee is not realistic.
    So, Professor Goodwin and Dr. Verma, wouldn't you agree 
that the Dobbs decision led to this kind of chaos, as to 
appropriate care to be provided in that----
    Professor Goodwin. Absolutely----
    Senator Hirono [continuing]. Situation?
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. Right, Senator. The Dobbs 
decision did unleash a torrent of uncertainty throughout the 
United States, where doctors fear losing their medical license 
to practice if they intervene before the law says that they 
should, these laws. They also fear criminal punishment and 
civil fines. As I mentioned, in the State of Texas, there can 
be criminal punishments up to 99 years----
    Senator Hirono. Mm-hmm.
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. Incarceration fines up to 
$100,000. These are some of the considerations that doctors 
struggle with, including then, losing their medical license to 
practice.
    Dr. Verma. Absolutely.
    Senator Hirono. Dr. Verma.
    Dr. Verma. Every individual, person, pregnancy, and family 
is different. And the reason we train for so long as doctors is 
to be able to look at the unique person and medical situation 
in front of us and make decisions with them about the best 
course of action.
    When we have to think about what the law says, and if a 
patient is sick enough for us to be able to legally provide 
them care without risking criminal prosecution or losing our 
livelihood, that delays care. It prevents people from getting 
the care that they need then.
    Senator Hirono. I think to expect that doctors and hospital 
personnel will risk losing their license or being held 
criminally liable, that is something that--that is a risk that 
I would say a lot of doctors and others wouldn't want to take.
    Professor Goodwin, we've heard today that women are coerced 
to have abortions. Is that the data, that women are coerced, 
not that women freely choose to have abortions? Can you 
enlighten us?
    Professor Goodwin. Sure. Thank you so much for that 
question. The coercion is the coercion to be pregnant, to 
remain pregnant, States enacting coercive laws that force 
women, girls to endure pregnancies that they do not want, 
pregnancies that may be the result of rape and incest, 
pregnancies that may threaten their health. This is what is 
actually taking shape by these laws. And it's worth noting the 
historical arc of this. We cannot forget that forced pregnancy 
was also a feature of American slavery.
    And we must remember that the effort to ratify the 
Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery and involuntary 
servitude, specifically related to the forced pregnancies that 
were placed upon Black women and girls, that they had to 
endure. These forced pregnancies were so normalized that 
advertisements in the 1700s and the 1800s tell us quite clearly 
what it was that they endured. And if you will, let me just 
read a couple of them to you, just so that we know exactly what 
the Senators were trying to get rid of in American slavery.
    They included advertisements such as the following: 
``Runaways. The following Negroes ran away or absconded from me 
on Friday last, a Negro woman named Lena, about 18 years of 
age, and her child named Mary, about 2 years old. Mary is a 
bright mulatto child.'' That's from the Republican Star, 1811, 
Eastern Maryland.
    ``$5 reward. Ran away on Tuesday the 13th. The subscribers' 
Negro girl named Maria, with her female mulatto child, about 9 
months old. Maria was lately the property of Dr. Thomas 
McCall,'' March 22nd, 1810, Charleston, South Carolina.
    ``For sale or exchange, a young, healthy Negro wench and 
child. 'Tis not convenient to have a breeding wench in the 
family,'' Virginia Chronicle, March 9th, 1793.
    These kinds of advertisements were what Senators read as 
they drank their morning coffee and orange juice.
    So deeply troubling that baked into the story of American 
slavery and abolition is the story of sexual terrorism 
inflicted on Black girls and women. So troublingly normalized 
that the descriptors ``breeding wench'' and ``mulatto child'' 
simultaneously read as mundane daily affairs and horrors.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, very much, Professor, for 
reminding us there was a time when women did not own their own 
bodies. And that is exactly where we are today, as far as I'm 
concerned, that women in this country, persons are not able to 
make free choices about their bodies, and what--what, to be 
forced to have a child is probably the most freedom-taking 
thing that we can impose upon anyone in this country.
    And thank you for that reminder. Professor, you also 
mentioned about judge shopping or forum shopping. I think this 
is an issue that we need to face in this country, also. It was 
very clear that in Texas, which has 27 divisions, 20 of which 
has only one judge--it was so clear that there was judge 
shopping going on with that judge. And would you--would you say 
that we should do something to prevent judge shopping?
    Professor Goodwin. The forum shopping that took place was 
quite clear in this case----
    [Gavel is tapped.]
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. As Judge Kacsmaryk had in 
fact expressed anti-abortion views and activism. And most 
recently, it's been disclosed that he removed his name from a 
law review article that was going to be published at the 
University of Texas, that also further explained his anti-
abortion views. And that name was removed before he came before 
the Chambers for confirmation. So something does need to be 
done.
    Senator Hirono. Okay. Thank you for that.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Hirono.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, very much. Senator Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There's probably no 
issue in modern American politics that engenders sharper 
disagreement than the question of abortion. I think everyone 
here agrees on that. It's a deeply moral issue that reflects 
our values, who we are as a country. It's an emotional issue. 
It's a personal issue on which people feel very strongly. I 
believe the American people should decide abortion policy. I 
believe that's what our Constitution designs. Unfortunately, my 
Democrat colleagues on this Committee disagree.
    They do not believe in democracy when it comes to the issue 
of abortion. They want unelected judges to set one standard for 
the entire country. And if the voters disagree, the voters have 
no choice. And look, the reason the Democrats want this issue 
to be out of the hands of the voters is quite obvious, because 
the modern Democrat Party is wildly out of step with the 
American people on the question of abortion.
    The current position of virtually every Democrat Senator in 
this body is that abortion should be absolutely unlimited, 
available up until the moment of birth and even, shockingly, in 
some instances, after birth, that partial-birth abortion should 
be fully legal, that there should be no parental notification 
and no parental consent, no matter how young the girl is, who 
may be seeking an abortion, and that all of it should be funded 
by taxpayer money. Now, that is an extreme and radical view. 
How extreme and radical?
    Well, according to a Harvard-Harris poll from last year, 10 
percent of Americans, only 10 percent, support abortion on 
demand up until the point of birth. That's the position. If you 
want to be a Democrat in the Senate, that's the position you 
have to embrace because that's where the money is. That's where 
the activists are. That's where the angry voices are, that fuel 
a Democrat campaign. But 90 percent of Americans look at that 
position and say, we disagree.
    And so, you understand now why my Democrat colleagues don't 
want this decision decided by the voters. Because if 90 percent 
of the voters disagree with the extreme policy decision they've 
embraced, their position will not prevail at the ballot box. 
And by the way, it's not just the voters in the United States 
who disagree with Senate Democrats on this. It is virtually 
every voter on planet Earth.
    The United States is such an extreme outlier. Out of the 
entire country, there are only seven countries on Earth--out of 
the entire planet--that allow abortion after 20 weeks. And yet 
every one of my Democrat colleagues wants to do so. Europe, 
virtually all of Europe, including the left-wing socialists, 
the Greens there, they think the Democrats in this body are 
loons on this issue. Sweden has an 18-week limit on seeking an 
abortion. None of my Democrat colleagues would vote for 
Sweden's law. France has a 14-week limit, France. None of my 
colleagues would vote for France's law. Germany and Luxembourg 
have 12-week limits. And the position of Democrats is 40 weeks 
up until the very moment of birth. No limits at all. That's a 
horrifying position.
    I suppose my Democrat colleagues can comfort themselves 
with the company they're in. Communist China, Iran, and North 
Korea, and the National Democrat Party, they all have the same 
view, those tyrannies, at least, are explicit, which is life 
has no value. And so, they don't embrace any limits.
    And by the way, look, there's so much rhetoric on this 
issue that a skeptical listener would be justified doubting 
what any of us are saying, but if you don't believe what I'm 
saying, look to the votes.
    In the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe and 
sending this decision back to the voters so the voters could 
decide, what did my colleagues in the Senate do? Promptly voted 
on a bill that would strike down just about every reasonable 
restriction in the country, that the voters have decided--to 
legalize partial-birth abortion, to provide no protection for 
unborn children. Those are extreme positions.
    And Dr. Skop, I'd like to ask you, what is unlimited--what 
are the consequences of unlimited abortion on demand? What does 
a 40-week or a 36-week unborn child who is enduring a partial-
birth abortion, what does that child experience if that 
procedure is allowed to happen?
    Dr. Skop. A partial-birth abortion delivers the baby 
intact. So the very first thing that would happen is that the 
woman's cervix must be aggressively dilated to a large dilation 
that is very likely to damage her cervix. And several high-
quality systematic reviews have documented increased risk of 
preterm birth in a subsequent pregnancy after a procedure like 
that. So not only is it hurting her this time, it will lead to 
further complications, such as cervical incompetence. The baby, 
generally, is not killed first.
    As I reported, 70 percent of late-term abortion providers 
say they do not routinely do this. These babies are highly 
likely to continue to live throughout the process of labor. 
They're delivered as a breech, and their head is crushed. So 
that would be the point when they would die, is when their head 
is crushed.
    Other late-term abortion, I mean these--they're blind 
procedures in many cases. So the instruments could damage the 
uterus. They could puncture the uterus. There are a number of 
horrible consequences documented, where adjacent bowel has been 
disrupted, urinary tract injuries, hemorrhage. There is really 
no reason that an abortion needs to be done that late, ever.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you.
    [Gavel is tapped.]
    Chair Durbin. Senator Booker.
    Senator Booker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank 
all the witnesses for being here today.
    Ms. Goodwin, I'm appreciative of your scholarship. And I 
want to ask you to maybe go a little bit deeper with me when it 
comes to protecting women. The testimony by Ms. Zurawski and 
Dr. Verma were really compelling to me, but the data is really 
stunning. U.S. women are more likely to die during or after 
pregnancy than anywhere else in the world--in the developed 
world, excuse me. And public health experts are predicting that 
this will get a lot worse.
    Right now, the United States is only 1 of 13 countries in 
the entire planet where maternal mortality rates, deaths of 
women from pregnancy until 1 year postpartum, as worse today--
worse today than it was 25 years ago. We know that a 2022 
University of Colorado study projected that in the first year 
following a nationwide abortion ban, the number of maternal 
deaths would increase 13 percent. And in subsequent years, 
maternal deaths could increase 24 percent.
    And the Commonwealth Fund found that States with heavily 
restrictive abortion access in 2020 had maternal mortality 
deaths that were 62 percent higher than they were in States 
where abortion access was easily more accessible. I mean these 
are stunning numbers when we're talking about the health and 
well-being of women in this country, but you went one step 
further. And I'd like for, maybe, this to be the second layer 
of your response about the stunning realities for Black women.
    Professor Goodwin. That's right. And thank you so much, 
Senator Booker, for your question and also your commitment on 
these issues. For Black women, it's devastating; nationally, 
three-and-a-half times more likely than their white 
counterparts to die during, or shortly after, pregnancy, but 
that's nationally. When we go to certain counties and cities, 
then it can be 5 times, 10 times, 15 times more likely, their 
deaths, than their white counterparts.
    I'd also like to correct the record here because there's 
been much said about the history of eugenics being one that was 
portrayed on Black women. To clarify, in 1927, the case Buck v. 
Bell, which is a horrific case that introduced eugenics into 
the United States, was a case that explicitly involved a poor 
white woman. And this is important because it's a commentary 
that Justice Thomas has made, and we've heard today, that early 
eugenics was about Black women.
    It was a horrific campaign that was targeted at poor white 
people like Carrie Buck, in the State of Virginia. And it was a 
law then, the eugenics law, that spread throughout the United 
States, but that history is important because of inaccurate 
conflations. It is true that later on, during Jim Crow, when 
Black women demanded more, such as voting rights, such as 
equality, that the Mississippi appendectomy, which was coercive 
sterilization, was introduced.
    And it's worth threading the needle because the person who 
helped us learn about that was Fannie Lou Hamer, as she 
threaded together the lack of bodily autonomy, the lack of 
voting rights. And especially, as there are those that say, 
take this to the democratic process, what does that mean in 
States where Black people have historically been 
disenfranchised from voting, including Mississippi, Georgia, 
and other States with abortion banned?
    Senator Booker. Thank you. Dr. Verma, I've been working on 
maternal mortality issues since I came to the Senate and since 
I discovered how stunning the numbers are in our Nation, 
relative to other countries, how many women are dying in 
childbirth. And the fact that Black women are three-and-a-half 
times more likely is stunning, and I'm wondering--the data that 
I'm looking at from, you know, non-partisan, I should say 
independent, science-based research really are predicting that 
these rates that are already horrific in our country are going 
to rise.
    And we heard the testimony of Dr.--excuse me, of Ms. 
Zurawski. Could you just give us, from your professional 
standpoint, an understanding that, again, this hearing, often, 
they're set out to be about something, and then they get spun 
off, but this hearing really is about the consequences for the 
health and well-being after the Dobbs decision. These 
staggering numbers, some of which I read--what is your 
experience? And how do you see the next months, if not years 
ahead.
    Dr. Verma. Yes, absolutely. Thank you for that question. So 
we've seen in the data that there is a link between places with 
abortion restrictions--stricter abortion restrictions and 
higher rates of maternal mortality in the United States. 
Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the 
country and has very strict restrictions on abortion. And we've 
seen, based on data out of places like Texas, that even when 
these laws have exceptions for things like medical emergency, 
we've heard about the confusion on the ground.
    And we've seen in the data that people with high-risk 
pregnancies still have a harder time----
    [Gavel is tapped.]
    Dr. Verma [continuing]. Getting the care that they need, 
and often are denied that care. And so, we absolutely expect to 
see more people getting hurt because of these laws. I also want 
to just correct--so abortion care, again, is incredibly safe. 
We've read a couple of mentions of it being a blind procedure. 
As the one OB-GYN on this panel that does do full-spectrum 
reproductive healthcare, including abortion care, we do this 
procedure incredibly safely with ultrasound guidance.
    I also want to address that, again, what Chairman Durbin 
said earlier, that in this country, 90 percent of abortions 
occur in the first trimester. Less than 1 percent occur after 
20 weeks. And when abortions do occur later in pregnancy, it is 
usually because something has gone terribly wrong with the 
patient or the pregnancy. Abortions up until the moment of 
birth simply do not happen. That does not reflect the reality 
of abortion care in this country.
    In addition, what the Democrats are trying to do here is to 
allow people to make these important decisions----
    [Gavel is tapped.]
    Dr. Verma [continuing]. Without legislative interference. I 
perform abortions for grandmothers, for adolescents, for 
doctors, for people of faith, for people who never thought that 
they would need an abortion. What each of my patients needs the 
ability to do is to make these important decisions themselves, 
about their health care and their lives.
    Senator Booker. Thank you, Dr. Verma. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Booker. Senator Tillis.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thanks to all the 
witnesses for being here today. Special thanks to Dr. 
Wubbenhorst, from my home State, for being here.
    Dr. Wubbenhorst, just one point. I've had somebody ask me 
what legislative measure I was most proud of when I was speaker 
of the house. And I told them that it was compensation for 
eugenics victims in North Carolina, first State to ever do it.
    And Professor Goodwin, I would say I studied the issue a 
lot to get support. And it's very clear it was 
disproportionately racially motivated, beginning with the late 
1950s, on into the early 1970s, when I've met a victim of the 
Mississippi appendectomy, who's about my age, who found out 
when she was trying to have a child that she had been 
sterilized.
    Dr. Wubbenhorst, I've noticed you during the--I was here 
for all the testimony--I noticed you take a lot of notes. So 
the first question I have--I hate to put you on the spot--are 
there any points that have been made here that, in the 
questions asked at this point, to this stage, that you would 
like to either clarify or take a counter position from some of 
the other witnesses' testimony?
    Dr. Wubbenhorst. Sure. Thank you, very much, for the chance 
to do that. I think that a couple of times, people have 
mentioned the issue of maternal mortality being higher in 
States with restrictive abortion laws. I'm very familiar with 
that literature. There are about seven papers. Every single one 
of those studies does not--has a methodological flaw. The most 
important flaw is that none of those studies take into account 
issues like health workforce, like the distribution of health 
workers, the lack of care in rural areas, and economics.
    So, I feel that that literature is very flawed. It is not, 
by any means, definitive and cannot be stated to demonstrate 
that abortion restrictions lead to increased maternal 
mortality. On the contrary, there's a study that was done in 
Mexico, indicating that--looking at all of these factors and 
showing that the most powerful influence on maternal mortality, 
was the availability of skilled help at birth and the 
environmental situation. For example, did the household have 
running water and sewage and so on and so forth?
    Senator Tillis. I see some of your colleagues taking notes. 
So I'll invite a member on the other side of the aisle to ask 
them if they want to yield time for rebuttal. But I do think if 
we're going to be instructed--if we're going to make good 
policy here, we have to be fully informed.
    And I believe that the factors that are leading to those 
mortality rates are not as simple as either one, either extreme 
of the arguments presenting here. So that's not putting us in a 
good position to come up with reasonable policy.
    Doctor, I'm going to call you Ingrid before I ask this 
question. I've heard you referred to as Skop and Scope. Which 
do you prefer?
    Dr. Skop. It's Skop, but Ingrid is fine.
    Senator Tillis. Okay. Dr. Skop, you were--and Mr. Chair, 
I'd like to seek consent to put an article from Detroit 
Catholic, where Dr. Skop is quoted, into the record.
    Chair Durbin. Without objection.
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Senator Tillis. I've got the specific section of the Texas 
law. I'm not an attorney, but my attorney suggests that Ms. 
Zurawski's--did I pronounce that right, ma'am?--situation, that 
perhaps the doctor was given bad legal advice. It appears in a 
section under Section 170A.002, that they could have had--
knowing that the condition that Ms. Zurawski had was likely, 
was an inviable fetus and going to threaten the health of the 
mother. And within a few days, she did experience sepsis. It 
seems like to me maybe the doctor wasn't guilty of malpractice, 
but a legal advisor was guilty of malpractice. Would you agree 
with that?
    Dr. Skop. I think what's going on, on the ground in Texas--
and I will agree with Dr. Verma and Ms. Zurawski. There is 
confusion----
    Senator Tillis. Yes.
    Dr. Skop [continuing]. Normally, doctors, of course, are 
not legally trained. And normally, they depend on advice from 
their professional societies to help them understand new laws.
    What has been noticeably absent in Texas is any statement 
from the Texas Medical Association, any statement from the 
Texas Board of Medicine, Board of Pharmacy, Board of Nursing, 
Hospital Association. So, all of these organizations--you can 
figure out why they might be silent, you know, make your own 
conclusions, but they have been silent----
    Senator Tillis. Yes----
    Dr. Skop [continuing]. And that is the reason for the 
confusion.
    Senator Tillis [continuing]. In my read of it, I honestly--
Ms. Zurawski, I'm blessed with a granddaughter named Willow, 
2\1/2\ years old--my daughter, and, I hate--I'm not even going 
to talk about it because I don't think I could get through it. 
But this is a legal--legal professional who's guilty of 
malpractice. And the legal advisors of the medical centers in 
the State of Texas should be honest, set their political 
agendas aside, and give good legal advice so doctors can 
provide care that I think, in Ms. Zurawski's case, she was 
entitled to. And instead, they let her get very sick. Thank 
you, Mr. Chair.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Tillis, I'm going to give Ms. 
Zurawski an opportunity to respond, although she was in extreme 
situation in the ICU when this happened. I know that her 
husband is with her today. And I'm sure they've both discussed 
some of the issues that have been raised about your care, 
whether there was medical malpractice or legal negligence of 
some sort. I want to give you a chance to respond, if you can.
    Ms. Zurawski. Thank you for the opportunity. So, I'm not a 
legal expert. I'm not a doctor. I think that my doctors and my 
healthcare team were doing the best that they could with the 
information that they had and the guidance that they were being 
given by the ethics board at the hospital. I know that they 
also consulted with colleagues at the hospital that I was at, 
as well as outside of that hospital in Texas.
    And they asked several times, to several physicians, at 
several facilities whether I could be transferred, if there was 
different healthcare that could be provided somewhere else, if 
I could have received an abortion somewhere else. And across 
the board, no matter who they asked, they were told time and 
time again that no, they wouldn't have been able to provide an 
abortion. So it wasn't just my healthcare team. It was everyone 
else that they consulted during the whole 3-day ordeal, as well 
as afterwards.
    Senator Tillis. Mr. Chair, just to be clear on my position, 
I don't believe doctors should be lawyers unless they've got a 
legal degree. And I don't think lawyers should be doctors 
unless they have a medical degree. My point was not about the 
doctor. They were in a difficult situation. They were trying to 
care for you.
    My question is what the motivation was, to not read the 
plain text of the statute that a non-attorney can read and 
understand that that should have been a legal basis for saying 
that they could have proceeded with the procedure that resulted 
in devastating consequences for a prospective family. Thank 
you, Mr. Chair.
    Chair Durbin. Well, I'm going to conclude, if I might, as 
Chair, and just say the reason we are at this moment in history 
is because the Dobbs decision decided we were going to 
redefine, State by State, the access to abortion and define the 
legal and medical circumstances. This is tricky territory. It's 
dangerous territory, as we've been told here. And that's why I 
think we've had this hearing this morning. Senator Padilla.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to start just 
by thanking you for holding this important hearing and thanking 
all the witnesses for joining us today as we discuss the 
efforts we've undertaken to ensure a woman's right to abortion 
care. It's not lost on me that this fight is actually larger 
than abortion care alone.
    As we work to address the unprecedented actions taken by 
the far-right wing of the Supreme Court, it's not lost on us 
that as they're working to strip away basic rights, they're 
also failing to hold themselves accountable for some common-
sense ethical standards. So there's a lot going on here. I look 
forward to working with the Chair to explore those greater 
issues, as well to make sure that we can restore some public 
confidence into a co-equal--they claim to be completely 
independent, but is a co-equal branch of Government, as we work 
to protect the rights and protections that so many Americans 
hold dear.
    Now, my first question deals with sort of the separation of 
powers and role of the courts question. You know, it's clear 
that one troubling aspect of the recent Fifth Circuit decision, 
which many scholars and even fellow judges found legally 
unsound, was its attempt to intrude on a decades-old, public-
safety-driven decision by the FDA.
    Now, the FDA, we all know who the FDA is and what the FDA 
does, but the FDA is the agency that Congress has entrusted 
with making scientific decisions relating to our health and 
safety. So, when the FDA tests and approves a medication for 
use, people rely on that. They have trust in the testing and 
approval process.
    And so, when activist judges take it upon themselves to 
overstep the separation of powers and intrude on the FDA's 
decision-making authority, the authority entrusted in it by 
Congress, it leaves science no longer to just the scientists.
    And Senator Tillis is talking about, I don't want doctors 
to practice law unless they have a law degree. He doesn't want 
lawyers to practice medicine unless they have the medical 
degree. I don't want Justices making scientific decisions 
unless they have that education expertise.
    Dr. Verma, simply a yes-or-no question, is regulated 
medical abortion in the United States safe?
    Dr. Verma. Yes, absolutely.
    Senator Padilla. So can you describe then the risks to 
patients when judges, rather than scientists, are making 
decisions about medicines that Americans rely on?
    Dr. Verma. Absolutely. Thank you for that question. So we 
know, based on decades of data, that medication abortion is 
incredibly safe and effective. By regulating a medication, or 
taking a medication off the market, that we know is safe and 
effective, we limit patients' ability to get the care that they 
need. That includes care for people that need abortions and for 
miscarriage management.
    Mifepristone is used very safely and effectively for 
management of miscarriages and shortens the amount of time it 
takes someone to pass a pregnancy. A lot of people experiencing 
miscarriages are already going through a traumatic event. And 
so, to be able to offer them the most effective treatment 
option is incredibly important.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you. Now, despite the lack of 
attention that it gets in the press coverage, we know that 
abortions are sometimes necessary to stabilize a woman's 
condition. Right?
    When a woman's health or life is in danger, that becomes 
part of the conver--it should be more of the conversation than 
it is in our national discourse. Yet, it seems like so many 
States post-Dobbs are passing laws that are creating, either 
unintentionally or sometimes very intentionally, conflicting 
laws, leading to confusion and impossible decisions, for 
decisions to make on a moment's notice. And Exhibit A is your 
testimony, Ms. Zurawski. So first of all, let me thank you for 
being here. Thank you, for your courage and your bravery to 
share your experience.
    Some people in the legal world say, well, there's a 
conflict between State and Federal law. Well, there's a process 
for hashing that out through the courts. That takes a long 
time. In the meantime, we have women showing up in hospitals 
and emergency rooms, that can't afford to wait. And you've 
described your experience from the medical perspective.
    Just wondering if you could take a minute to share what 
kind of mental anguish that experience was like in--while you 
were in the ICU, and since then, and if you have a specific 
message for women living in States that are denied abortion 
care or access to the care that they need, but live in a State 
that's clamping down on access and options for them.
    Ms. Zurawski. Absolutely. And thank you for the 
opportunity. We've heard a lot today about the mental trauma 
and the negative, harmful effects on a person's psychological 
well-being after they have an abortion, supposedly. And I'm 
curious why that's not relevant for me, as well, because I 
wasn't permitted to have an abortion. And the trauma and the 
PTSD and the depression that I have dealt with in the 8 months 
since this happened to me is paralyzing.
    On top of that, I am still struggling to have children. And 
I wanted to address my Senators, Cruz and Cornyn, who neither 
of whom, regrettably, are in the room right now, but I would 
like for them to know that what happened to me--I think most 
people in this room would agree was horrific--but it's a direct 
result of the policies that they support. I nearly died on 
their watch. And furthermore, as a result of what happened to 
me, I may have been robbed of the opportunity to have children 
in the future, and it's because of the policies that they 
support.
    What happened to me was horrible, but I am one of many. And 
quite frankly, I'm lucky. I'm lucky that I have a husband that 
could take me to the hospital. I don't have other children that 
I had to worry about finding healthcare for. I have a job that 
was understanding, that allowed me to grieve for 3 days as I 
waited to almost die. What about all of the women that don't 
have those same opportunities, that don't have access to 
healthcare, that don't have health insurance, that don't have a 
partner? What about them?
    Senator Padilla. Thank you. Thank you, Chair.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, all, 
for being here today.
    Professor Goodwin, help me understand your point of view. I 
think this is a yes-or-no question. Do you support it being 
legal to abort an unborn child up to the moment of birth?
    Professor Goodwin. Senator Kennedy, it is not a yes-or-no 
question. I support women like Ms. Zurawski. Women across 
this----
    Senator Kennedy. No, ma'am, no, ma'am, I don't--I think it 
is a yes-or-no question.
    Professor Goodwin. No. Well, let me answer.
    Senator Kennedy. If, if there were a law that's--I'm just 
trying to understand your perspective. And I'm not accusing you 
of this----
    Professor Goodwin. Of course, not.
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. But, you know, people sort of 
talk around this issue. If there were a bill that said that a 
woman has an unfettered right to abort an unborn baby for any 
reason up to the moment of birth, would you vote yes or would 
you vote no?
    Professor Goodwin. Senator Kennedy, I refuse to be shackled 
by your question----
    Senator Kennedy. You're----
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. What I have answered, is 
that there are conditions----
    Senator Kennedy. You--you----
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. That occur----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. You don't know----
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. During pregnancy.
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Whether you would vote yes or 
no?
    Professor Goodwin. There are conditions during pregnancy 
that mean, after 10 weeks----
    Senator Kennedy. No, I've said----
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. Fourteen weeks----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. I've said----
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. Twenty weeks----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Unfettered discretion.
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. Twenty-four weeks----
    Senator Kennedy. You would----
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. Conditions such as----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. You would support----
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. Ms. Zurawski's, and----
    Senator Kennedy. You're here advocating----
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. I would support--I would 
support her life----
    Senator Kennedy. You--I understand, I would, too----
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. I would support her 
personhood.
    Senator Kennedy. But, you're advocating a law----
    Professor Goodwin. I support her person----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. You're advocating a law that 
says that an unborn baby can be aborted up to the moment of 
birth for any reason. Are you not?
    Professor Goodwin. Let me clarify what the Fourteenth 
Amendment says in the first sentence, that ``Citizens of this 
United States are individuals that are born.'' That is what our 
Constitution says. Do you----
    Senator Kennedy. But why won't you answer my question--
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. Support our Constitution?
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Professor? I'm not trying to 
argue. I just want to understand what your position is. And I 
think you're afraid to say that you do support that. If you do 
support it, I think you--for just, for the purpose of an 
intellectual discussion, you ought to just say so.
    Professor Goodwin. For purposes of an intellectual 
discussion, I'm happy to have that with you, but that's----
    Senator Kennedy. Could you answer----
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. Not the tone----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Could you answer my question? 
Do you support--please? I mean, you teach. Okay? I'm sure 
you've had students ask this question. Do you support--do you 
support making it legal to abort an unborn baby for any reason, 
any reason, up to the moment before birth?
    Professor Goodwin. Senator, let's have that intellectual 
discussion that you want.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. We could start if you'd answer my 
question.
    Professor Goodwin. And----
    Senator Kennedy. I can't go to my next----
    Professor Goodwin. Well----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Question until you answer 
that question.
    Professor Goodwin. I want you to be able to go to your 
second----
    Senator Kennedy. Good.
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. And your third questions--
--
    Senator Kennedy. Answer it for me.
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. I do, but as I have 
explained, there are many different conditions----
    Senator Kennedy. No, I said unfettered----
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. During a pregnancy.
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Discretion. No conditions. 
I'm making it easy for you.
    Professor Goodwin. Well, I have already shared with you----
    Senator Kennedy. Okay.
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. Senator, that I support----
    Senator Kennedy. I get it.
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. Women's person----
    Senator Kennedy. I don't want to use all my time. You're 
not going to answer.
    Professor Goodwin. And I support Ms. Zurawski's----
    Senator Kennedy. And that is your right.
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. Personhood----
    Senator Kennedy. But I would, I would respect you more if 
you'd just say, here's my answer.
    Professor Goodwin. I'm sorry that you don't respect me----
    Senator Kennedy. I do----
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. Very much.
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Respect you, but I said I'd 
respect you more if you'd just answer my question.
    Dr., tell me how to say your last name.
    Dr. Wubbenhorst. Wubbenhorst.
    Senator Kennedy. Dr. Wubbenhorst, do you support a law that 
will allow, for any reason, unfettered discretion, the abortion 
of an unborn child up until the moment of birth?
    Dr. Wubbenhorst. No.
    Senator Kennedy. You don't. Dr. Verma.
    Dr. Verma. Senator Kennedy, so, I'm the one person and one 
doctor in this room that does provide abortion care. And I can 
tell you that does not reflect the reality of abortion----
    Senator Kennedy. No, I'm----
    Dr. Verma [continuing]. Care.
    Senator Kennedy. I understand. I'm just asking----
    Dr. Verma. It doesn't----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. A question.
    Dr. Verma. It simply doesn't----
    Senator Kennedy. But do you----
    Dr. Verma [continuing]. Happen.
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Support it? There are--there 
are bills before Congress that will allow that to happen.
    Dr. Verma. That's----
    Senator Kennedy. You don't support it? Or are you going to 
be a----
    Dr. Verma. Again----
    Senator Kennedy. You're not answering my question.
    Dr. Verma. As the doctor in this room who does provide 
abortion care, that is not how abortion care in this country 
works. It's a hypothetical that does a disservice to our----
    Senator Kennedy. But if a patient----
    Dr. Verma [continuing]. Patients.
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Came to you and said, I'm 
going to probably have a baby this week, and I've changed my 
mind. And I would like you, doctor, to abort the child, would 
you do it?
    Dr. Verma. That is not how abortion care in this country--
--
    Senator Kennedy. But if----
    Dr. Verma [continuing]. Works.
    Senator Kennedy. But if a patient did, would you do it?
    Dr. Verma. My job as a doctor is to look at each----
    Senator Kennedy. Okay.
    Dr. Verma [continuing]. Individual situation----
    Senator Kennedy. I mean--I'm sorry.
    Dr. Verma. I have never----
    Senator Kennedy. I don't mean to be rude, but I can tell 
neither you nor the professor will answer my question.
    Dr. Verma. I have never----
    Senator Kennedy. And I think you both have an opinion, and 
I don't understand why you won't share it----
    Dr. Verma. I have----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. If we're going to solve this 
problem.
    Dr. Verma [continuing]. Provided----
    Senator Kennedy. Doctor----
    Dr. Verma [continuing]. I've provided care for a few 
years----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. How about you?
    Dr. Verma [continuing]. And I've never seen that situation.
    Senator Kennedy. How about you, Doc? Would you?
    Dr. Skop. I do not support unfettered abortion, and I would 
like to point out that if a woman did have a life-threatening 
condition in pregnancy past approximately 22 weeks, that baby 
can be delivered alive by induction or C-section. And we can 
try to save that baby. The intent of abortion is a dead baby, 
and that is not necessary in that situation.
    Senator Kennedy. I mean, I want you to all understand where 
I'm coming from. This is a tough issue, and it's a tough issue 
because there's some tough questions we've got to answer. And 
when you won't answer the questions--when you're invited by my 
Democratic friends, the Majority, and you won't answer the most 
fundamental question--we've got a bill in front of us that will 
basically say----
    [Gavel is tapped.]
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. A woman has the unfettered 
right to abort at any time, for any reason, up to the moment of 
birth. And that's a gut-check issue. And I would expect you, as 
experts, to answer that truthfully, how you do it. Thank you 
for your indulgence, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Ossoff.
    Senator Ossoff. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to 
all of the witnesses for joining us and sharing your 
experiences and perspective. It's been tremendously impactful 
to hear from you.
    Mr. Chairman, I do want to note and acknowledge that we 
have a Georgia physician with us, and Dr. Verma, thank you for 
your work providing healthcare for Georgia women at a time when 
the provision of healthcare for Georgia women is under attack 
by elected officials in Georgia. As you noted in your opening 
remarks, where one of the most extreme laws in the country has 
been enacted--a 6-week ban on abortion, which takes effect 
before many women even know that they are pregnant--in the 
midst of a maternal health crisis in our State.
    Mr. Chairman, I don't know if you've heard these 
statistics, but more than half of Georgia counties have no OB-
GYN at all. No OB-GYN in more than half of the counties in our 
State. We have one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the 
United States--even worse, much worse for Black women in 
Georgia, and a shortage of qualified providers of OB-GYN care.
    And so, Dr. Verma, what I want to discuss with you, as we 
consider the impact on human health of Georgia's extreme 6-week 
abortion ban, is how this risks worsening our shortage of 
qualified physicians.
    I'm looking at data here from the Association of American 
Medical Colleges, that new OB-GYNs are much less likely to 
apply into residency programs with extreme abortion bans like 
the 6-week ban in Georgia. And I think we all recognize this, 
but Dr. Verma, these physicians provide the full spectrum of 
perinatal care. So, what does the State's OB-GYN shortage mean 
for Georgia women, please, Dr. Verma, based upon your 
professional experience?
    Dr. Verma. Thank you, Senator Ossoff. And thank you for 
everything that you do for healthcare providers and patients in 
Georgia. So, I am very concerned that the law in Georgia, our 
6-week ban, is going to make the healthcare shortage worse, and 
affect providers wanting to go into OB-GYN and provide in 
Georgia.
    I have talked to multiple medical students and residents 
who say they aren't going to stay in Georgia because they don't 
want to be in an environment where they can't practice 
evidence-based medicine and have to worry about whether they 
are going to be criminally prosecuted, have their license 
removed, have their livelihood threatened.
    The same procedures that we use for abortion care are also 
used for miscarriage management, the same medications, the same 
procedures. And so, I've talked to trainees who worry that if 
they stay in Georgia, they won't get the training that they 
need to take care of someone who comes in at 14 weeks, bleeding 
heavily, that they won't be able to provide them with the 
emergency care that they need.
    We know, based on survey data, that 90 percent of OB-GYNs 
have said that they've had a patient in the last year that 
needed abortion care. And the vast majority have gotten that 
patient connected with the care that they need, even if they 
personally feel conflicted with abortion, even if they don't 
provide the care themselves.
    So this is something that OB-GYNs support. They want 
patients to get the care that they need, and they're worried 
that they won't be able to practice evidence-based medicine in 
Georgia and are leaving.
    Senator Ossoff. And just to be clear--because I think it's 
vitally important that Georgians understand this and that the 
Senate understand this: a 6-week abortion ban in Georgia, 
backed by threats of criminal prosecution and imprisonment for 
physicians. And we see in the data that these laws are 
deterring OB-GYNs from pursuing residencies in States with laws 
like this.
    Dr. Verma. Absolutely. And you're absolutely right, that 
that then affects not just--again, like, I'm an OB-GYN that 
does abortion care, but I also deliver babies. I do GYN 
surgery. I do cancer screenings. I do full-spectrum OB-GYN, as 
many OB-GYNs do. So this is not just going to affect access to 
abortion care.
    It's going to affect access to all care, all reproductive 
healthcare in our State. We've--I practice in Atlanta, where 
we've already experienced the closure of a major medical system 
that's having devastating effects on access to care in our 
city. You're absolutely right, that half of counties in Georgia 
have no OB-GYN. I expect this is just going to get worse.
    Senator Ossoff. Thank you, Dr. Verma. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Blackburn.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Dr. Verma, I've just--I just want to ask you very quickly, 
you talk about evidence-based medicine. Do you consider a 
heartbeat evidence-based? Would you consider----
    Dr. Verma. Could you clarify that?
    Senator Blackburn [continuing]. That a living--would you 
consider that a living being if there's a heartbeat detected? 
Would that be evidence enough that there is life?
    Dr. Verma. So based on evidence-based medicine--and I think 
what you're trying----
    Senator Blackburn. No----
    Dr. Verma [continuing]. To get at is that----
    Senator Blackburn. No, I know what I'm trying to get at.
    Dr. Verma. Could you clarify for me what you're trying to 
get at?
    Senator Blackburn. No. Let me just say, you talk about 
evidence-based medicine. A beating heart is a sign of life.
    And Dr. Skop, earlier, you said a heartbeat can be detected 
at 28 days. Am I accurate? Did I understand that? I was 
watching in my office.
    Dr. Skop. It's present at about 23 days after 
fertilization. Usually, it's about a week later before we can 
detect it via ultrasound technology.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay, so at 23 days. Thank you, very--I 
think that's evidence of life. I want to talk for just a 
moment, Dr. Wubbenhorst and Dr. Skop, late-term abortions. When 
I'm talking to women in Tennessee, what I find is most people, 
regardless of party affiliation, they are opposed to late-term 
abortions. And the--from the work that I've done in the House 
and in the Senate, what I have found is that there seems to be 
dismemberment of the baby involved in these late-term 
abortions. And many times, there is an injection to stop that 
heart from beating. Is that accurate? Am I correct? You all are 
nodding yes.
    Okay, and then there are occasions during late-term 
abortions when the baby survives that process. And then the 
baby is delivered alive. And I've talked to so many women who 
were so highly offended with Governor Northam of Virginia's 
remarks around that. I'm just going to read these for the 
Committee so that it's accurate. He said, ``If a mother is in 
labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.'' And of 
course, he's referring to a mother in for an abortion, and she 
has gone into labor. He continues, ``The infant would be 
delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant 
would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family 
desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the 
physicians and the mother.''
    So, Dr. Wubbenhorst, you have delivered a lot of babies. As 
someone who has done this and who has personally cared for 
women who suffered physically and emotionally from the 
complications of abortion, then tell me how--is there any way, 
any reason, anyone would think that statement from Governor 
Northam was a compassionate, caring statement?
    Dr. Wubbenhorst. Yes. I think it's very clear that it's not 
a compassionate statement because if you allow a child--and in 
fact, I think the legal framework in this country is that if a 
child is neglected and allowed to die or killed, that's 
infanticide, and that's something that could be prosecuted.
    I think that's the same situation--it's the same situation 
if a woman undergoes a late abortion. We know that past 22, 23 
weeks, we are able to resuscitate those children, and they'll 
live. So I think that it is morally inconsistent to--and this 
happens, has happened in hospitals where I've worked. In one 
room you're fighting for the life of a child who's 22, 23, 24 
weeks. And in another room, you're aborting a child that's 28, 
32 weeks.
    Senator Blackburn. Yes, and, you know, visiting our NICUs 
and having friends and family that have had babies in the 
NICU--and you pray over these babies for the continuation of 
their life and their health and their recovery. And then when 
you hear about the practice of late-term abortion, it's just 
hard to square that up. I find it very difficult.
    Dr. Skop, I want to talk to you for just a minute. And I 
had talked with DOJ about the attacks on pregnancy centers, 
which there has not been a push forward to address these. But 
there have been many cases, and we've had some in Tennessee, 
where they've gone after people that were across the street 
from the center and were going through, protesting. And I see 
my time has run out, but I do want to get this question in, and 
you can answer it for me. We'll do this, Mr. Chairman, I'll 
take it from her in writing.
    I would like to know if you think DOJ and the Biden 
administration is doing enough to protect the pregnancy 
centers. They're protecting abortion centers but, and you can 
give me this in writing. I would like to get your read on what 
they are doing that protects the pregnancy centers and the 
healthcare that you're providing for expectant moms. Thank you, 
Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Welch.
    Senator Welch. Thank you, very much. I thank the witnesses. 
Mr. Chairman, this hearing is extremely important, but I also 
think it's in the context of the conclusion that I'm coming to, 
and that is, that we have a crisis on the Supreme Court.
    The United States Supreme Court has a duty--it is to 
strengthen our democracy and strengthen respect for the rule of 
law, yet the United States Supreme Court, in many recent 
decisions, has, in my view, become a threat to democracy. And 
it has profoundly eroded respect for the rule of law.
    It's not just polls of American people that show a record-
low respect for the Court, confidence in the Court. It's not a 
popularity contest, of course, but the Court has been making 
decisions with outcomes that are very contrary to the public 
interest. That's a point of view, but I think one that can be 
backed up with evidence. But it's also been using intellectual 
manipulation in reaching its decisions. And I think the public 
gets that. It's not on the level.
    Let me give three examples.
    We have a corrupt campaign finance system, yet the Supreme 
Court, in Citizens United, made an assertion of facts--that 
I'll talk about in a minute--to justify unleashing unlimited 
money, unaccountable money, undisclosed money to pollute our 
political process.
    In the Bruen decision, the United States Supreme Court came 
up with a framework of analysis, so-called ``historical 
analysis,'' which essentially made up a history of the way 
back, to disregard the reality of today.
    And in the Dobbs decision, the Supreme Court disregarded 
precedent and stare decisis in order to achieve an outcome that 
we're now living with.
    The Supreme Court itself has added flames to the fire when 
some of those Justices were before this Committee, in this 
room, Mr. Chairman. On this question of precedent, one Justice 
told the Committee in 2020, ``I will obey all the rules of 
stare decisis,'' and agreed that Roe was super precedent.
    In 2018, another Justice told the Committee that Roe is an 
important precedent in the Supreme Court, which has been 
reaffirmed many times.
    In 2017, still another Justice told this Committee of Roe, 
quote, ``A good judge will consider precedent of the U.S. 
Supreme Court as worthy of treatment like any other.''
    And, of course, we've also had recently the report of 
ProPublica, about the ethical issues in the Supreme Court.
    So, I have two concerns. I don't know if I'll have time, 
but one is, for Professor Goodwin, about what I would regard as 
the departure from the doctrine of judicial restraint to a 
doctrine of judicial flexibility to achieve outcomes of the 
Court.
    And the second is for Ms. Zurawski, who, thank you for 
being here. You've spoken about your own experience, but 
there's moms who've lost kids because we are not allowed to 
pass gun safety legislation that meets the Supreme Court 
muster. There are citizens who are in agony about their 
democracy being ruled by folks who can give multimillion-dollar 
contributions. And there's women like you who are suffering 
because they've lost access to the healthcare that they need. 
So I'll start with you, Professor Goodwin.
    Professor Goodwin. Thank you very much, Senator Welch, for 
your question. As you mentioned, the outcome determinative 
nature of the Dobbs decision--and you're absolutely right. One 
day before, in the Bruen decision written by Justice Thomas, 
Justice Thomas said that a prologue was necessary to understand 
the history of men and their bodily autonomy, specifically 
Black men.
    He spent five paragraphs in the Bruen decision describing 
Black men historically, discrimination against them during 
slavery and Jim Crow, and how their bodily autonomy mattered, 
and how gun safety, or having guns, was important to that.
    You will not find a prologue mentioning anything about 
women in the Dobbs decision. Two words that you will not find 
in the Dobbs decision, ``Black woman,'' or ``Black women,'' 
together.
    You will not find five paragraphs that speak to the forced, 
involuntary nature of reproduction of Black women during 
slavery being forced into pregnancies. You will not read 
anything about Black maternal mortality in the Dobbs decision. 
So one day before, five paragraphs devoted to it. In the Dobbs 
decision, absolutely nothing.
    And as we look at this kind of turn to history, as you've 
mentioned, it's selective. It's opportunistic. It cherry picks 
through history.
    Let me just say this: Roe v. Wade was a 7-to-2 decision. 
Five of those seven Justices were Republican appointed. 
Prescott Bush, the father of George H. W. Bush, was the 
treasurer of Planned Parenthood. In the Roe v. Wade decision, 
what Justice Blackmun mentioned, and is absolutely right, 
abortion had not been criminalized in the United States. The 
Pilgrims had performed abortion, so had Indigenous People.
    When abortion becomes criminalized in this country, it was 
leading to, and around the time of, the Civil War. And we see 
some of the same rhetoric today used then----
    Senator Welch. Thank you.
    Professor Goodwin [continuing]. The concern about the 
browning of the United States. And that was the impetus for 
early abortion laws during the time of the Civil War. And we 
see the same kind of rhetoric today.
    Senator Welch. Thank you. My time is up, but I don't know 
if we can allow Ms. Zurawski just to speak briefly on behalf 
of, essentially, the collateral damage of these decisions.
    Ms. Zurawski. Thank you. And thank you for the opportunity. 
I'd like to address this repeated attempt by the Republicans at 
a vulgar mischaracterization of what someone who needs an 
abortion looks like. Frankly, it's stigmatizing, it's 
offensive, and it's unrealistic. And it doesn't reflect who 
needs an abortion or who wants an abortion in this country. And 
quite frankly, healthcare should not be a meritocracy. You 
shouldn't have to deserve healthcare in order to access it in 
this country. And what's going on is not an accident.
    As I mentioned before, when Dobbs first came down, the 
Biden administration put out guidance on who should and could 
receive an abortion. And in Texas, in my home State, Attorney 
General Ken Paxton sued over that guidance. And so, that 
guidance was revoked. And so, again, as I said before, what 
happened to me was intentional.
    Senator Welch. Thank you, thank you. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Welch. And thank you to our 
witnesses.
    There are a few points I'd like to make for the record as 
we close, one is on clinic violence. I want to make it clear--I 
think we have made it clear. It bears repeating. There is no 
excuse--underline ``no''--for violence on either side of this 
issue, none. And to harass physicians, or those who have an 
opposite point of view, is unacceptable from my point of view.
    And I hope the Department of Justice will treat offenders 
on both sides of that issue the same way with force to stop--
protect those who have a point of view on this issue.
    Second thing I want to say is the argument that this is 
about States rights. What happened in Amarillo? Was that about 
States rights? Here was an effort to eliminate the use of a 
drug which is used for chemical abortions nationwide--
nationwide. And that's what this Amarillo judge set out to do. 
So this is about more than States rights. I think it's about a 
point of view that goes much further.
    And finally, let me say I'm going to add into the record--I 
think it may have been here already, but a statement by the 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, that is 
part of this hearing today.
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Chair Durbin. They went through specific examples of some 
of the most outrageous cases you can imagine, already under 
Dobbs.
    One I'll read to you. ``An OB-GYN who was contacted by a 
social worker about an 11-year-old sex trafficking victim who 
was pregnant. Not only was the physician unable to perform an 
abortion under State law''--11 years old--``unable to perform 
an abortion under State law, but the social workers were unable 
to help the child obtain it in another State without risking 
prosecution themselves.''
    The 10-year-old in Ohio we've already made reference to.
    Come on. We're better than that as a Nation than to let 
this disintegrate into this reality.
    The reality is that the shameful situation needs to be 
resolved, and I don't know if it can be, politically, but I 
hope this hearing moves us closer to that day. The relentless 
assault on reproductive rights has to come to an end soon. I'm 
going to pledge to continue my efforts in this Committee to 
make sure that the light is being shone on these issues and 
work with my colleagues to enshrine protections for 
reproductive freedom. The Committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:44 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
