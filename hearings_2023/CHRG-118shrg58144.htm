                                       U.S. Senate,
        Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room 
SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Maria Cantwell, 
presiding.
    Present: Senators Cantwell (presiding), Sinema, Rosen, 
Lujan, Hickenlooper, Cruz, Wicker, Blackburn, Budd, and 
Schmitt.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    The Chair. The Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation will come to order.
    For more than--the hearing this morning is going to be 
examining NASA's Fiscal Year 2024 Budget and Priorities, and 
discussions of that.
    For more than 100 years, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration and its predecessor agency, the National Agency 
Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, have delivered on its 
commitment to make the United States of America a world leader 
in aviation and space. I am not sure how many know about the 
deep connection between NASA and the aviation industry, but 
there is a saying at the Agency, ``NASA is with you when you 
fly.'' When many of the aircraft roll off the line in Everett, 
Washington, they have a quieter and cleaner engine technology 
developed and tested, thanks to at least two NASA programs. So 
NASA has long been an important partner to the development of 
the 2 million strong American aviation and defense sector jobs.
    When it comes to space exploration, the scientific 
research, NASA has also been equally powerful. In 2022 alone, 
NASA delivered the first images from the James Webb Telescope 
and demonstrated the space launch system, an Orion crew vehicle 
that will send the first woman to the moon. The NASA DART 
mission even proved for the first time that this country could 
defend itself from a planet-killing asteroid, and every single 
one of these stories made national news. Two of them have close 
ties to the Washington State workforce. Workers in Redmond, 
Washington built part of the propulsion system for both the 
space launch system and the DART mission, and we also have 
several scientists who have been assigned research time on the 
Webb Telescope.
    But as a Congress, we cannot afford to take NASA and its 
success for granted. That is why this committee in the 
reauthorization of the Agency last year, was a critical part of 
the CHIPS and Science Act. This was the first NASA 
authorization in 5 years. Now, we might say it is because our 
colleague is no longer with us, who was a key advocate for 
always getting NASA authorized. But we authorized the Artemis 
Program and demanded that NASA establish both accountable 
leadership and a clear description of each element in the 
effort in response to concerns raised in the hearing by the 
head of the National Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel.
    We directed the Agency to create an independent program 
analysis, evaluation office, reduce the cost of delays 
associated with programs, and also, in response, raised 
concerns in this hearing this time by the Government 
Accountability Office. And we made it the policy of the United 
States to maintain world leadership in aeronautics by advancing 
such areas as advanced materials and manufacturing. Over the 
course of this hearing, I look forward to hearing from the 
Administrator about the progress of these particular areas.
    It is my goal to complete another NASA bill this Congress, 
this time with a multi-year authorization that will help ensure 
that the Nation's leading space and aeronautic research agency 
has stable, predictable funding that it needs to succeed. It 
would be the first multi-year NASA authorization in 13 years.
    It should be clear to every Member of Congress we cannot 
operate our science agencies on the cheap, and we should not 
operate them without clear, multi-year direction. Stable 
growing investments in the technologies of the future, from 
hypersonic wind tunnels to advanced manufacturing, are the best 
way to protect our national and economic security. Given NASA 
anything less could jeopardize our leadership in space 
exploration, slow down our progress on key issues as faster 
fuel efficiency, increase the challenges that we face at our 
space station, and jeopardize commonsense safety actions, like 
building redundant systems to transport astronauts.
    Administrator Nelson has been a tireless advocate to 
protect NASA's budget, so I look forward to working with him 
and Ranking Member Cruz to make sure that NASA and the United 
States keep their leadership position. So thank you for joining 
us today, Administrator Nelson, and now I turn it over to my 
colleague, Senator Cruz, for his statement.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED CRUZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS

    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Good morning. I 
suppose we should begin with a moment of regret. You and I had 
a wager going about the Kraken and the Stars, and last night as 
these wagers, we bid on winning sides and losing sides of the 
wagers. But I will say I look forward to some wonderful 
delicacies from Washington State as we celebrate the Star's 
game seven victory last night.
    The Chair. Well, congratulations, Senator Cruz. At least--I 
told him he should up on time if he wants to gloat, but it is 
OK.
    [Laughter.]
    The Chair. We are very proud of the Kraken. Congratulations 
to the Stars, and, yes, some great salmon is coming your way, 
and I think some beer, OK?
    Senator Cruz. Fabulous.
    The Chair. OK.
    Senator Cruz. Good morning. Administrator Nelson, welcome 
back to this committee. All of us have spent a lot of time 
here. You and I have been great partners on many pieces of 
space legislation, and thus far, your tenure as NASA 
Administrator has seen a number of important successes. Today I 
am looking forward to hearing an update on all things space.
    First, I think it is fitting to open with a note of 
congratulations to NASA and its international and commercial 
partners throughout the United States and the world, especially 
those partners in Texas, for all your recent successes. Like 
many Americans, I watched with excitement as Artemis I blasted 
off into space as the first phase of America's return to the 
moon. I am thrilled that NASA has named the crew of the Artemis 
II mission--Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, Jeremy 
Hansen--and I was incredibly privileged to be with you at 
Ellington Field in Houston for that announcement. Over the next 
year, they will complete their training at the Johnson Space 
Center for their 2024 flight to the moon.
    We were all equally excited about the recent test launch of 
SpaceX's Starship--from their Starship in Boc Chica, Texas. 
While the ``rapid unscheduled assembly'' was not exactly part 
of the plan, much was learned just getting off the pad, and we 
look forward to SpaceX launching again soon. Once again, 
Starship will help us return American boots to lunar soil for 
the first time in more than 50 years on the Artemis III 
mission.
    There is a reason the word ``Houston'' was one of the very 
first words spoken on the surface of the moon and why it is one 
of the most common words in any astronaut's vocabulary. Johnson 
Space Center in my hometown of Houston is responsible for 
carrying out many key missions for space exploration. Not only 
is it the home of the International Space Station Program, 
which I was glad after years of fighting for it, that you and I 
together were finally able to extend it to 2023. But it is also 
home to Mission Control and is playing a leading role in our 
efforts to put a sustainable human presence on the moon, and 
eventually put the first humans on the surface of Mars. From 
the Gateway Lunar Outpost, to the Orion capsule, to the next 
generation of space suits, to future lunar rovers, JSC is 
leading the way. As a lifelong Houstonian, I am so proud of the 
entire team at JSC and of the entire Houston space community.
    This year's budget request includes even more funding for 
new space suits developed by Collins Aerospace and Axiom, and 
will help our astronauts ensure that they are safe and 
productive on the ISS, on the moon, and beyond. These two 
companies are just many--that will make the new Houston space 
port a magnet for those who wish to help us explore the stars.
    Now, Administrator Nelson, for all the good things I have 
talked about, I do worry sometimes that we may be losing focus 
on what makes America the preeminent space-faring Nation. One 
of the reasons you and I were able to accomplish so much on 
this committee is both of us worked very hard to keep politics 
out of NASA and to focus on the core mission of exploration. 
Looking at this year's budget request, I see things like $22 
million for the ``Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity,'' 
which has little to do with what you have called ``a space race 
between the free world and China.'' If we show up at the 
Shackleton Crater, I highly doubt the communist--Chinese 
Communist Party will care much about how we have advanced an 
equity action plan.
    Similarly, this year, NASA, along with DOD and GSA, 
advanced a new climate-related regulation that requires 
contractors to disclose their ``greenhouse gas emissions, the 
risks they pose, and submit reduction targets validated by 
Science-Based Targets initiative,'' a non-governmental entity. 
Rather than helping us win the space race, the proposed rule 
would ensure that NASA could do less exploration and less 
science for more taxpayer dollars.
    Earlier this year, every one of my Republican colleagues on 
this committee joined me in sending a letter to you asking you 
to rescind the proposed rule. Your response to the letter was, 
unfortunately, underwhelming. I suspect that had you received 
such an answer when you were sitting on this committee, you 
would not have been especially pleased. I understand that any 
NASA faces pressure and political pressure from a White House. 
That was true in the prior administration. That is true in this 
administration. But one of the keys, I believe, for NASA's 
success is having the fortitude to press back on political 
pressure from either direction and to focus on the core 
mission. I very much hope at NASA we can continue to do so and 
continue to do so together.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Cruz. We will now turn to the 
Chair of the Subcommittee and the Ranking Member for their 
opening statements. And I have asked Senator Sinema to chair 
the rest of this hearing, and so thank you, Senator Sinema, for 
your leadership on space issues.

               STATEMENT OF HON. KYRSTEN SINEMA, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA

    Senator Sinema. Well, thank you, Chair Cantwell. Good to 
see you again, Administrator Nelson. I am honored to chair the 
Space and Science Subcommittee where I am proud to continue the 
leadership that led to the bipartisan passage of the CHIPS and 
Science Act last Congress. I look forward to building on those 
historic advancements and achieving America's space and science 
goals.
    NASA has a tremendous impact on my home State of Arizona, 
accounting for over $700 million and over 3,800 jobs in Fiscal 
Year 2021, and that doesn't account for all the manufacturing, 
contract work, and growing commercial space, industries that 
are all strengthened by NASA's work. Ultimately, American 
leadership in space is critical to keeping us safe, building a 
healthy economy, and serving as an engine to fuel rewarding 
careers.
    For the United States to remain the global leader in space, 
we need to ensure that Congress makes the necessary 
investments. That starts with NASA's initiatives in planetary 
defense, space exploration, earth and space science research, 
and advancing aeronautic and other technologies.
    There are few roles of government more important than 
planetary defense, and I am proud of Arizona's outsized 
contribution to confronting these challenges by playing a 
leading role in the NEO Surveyor and NEOWISE missions, helping 
to equip the planet against potentially harmful space objects 
and debris. It is absolutely essential that Congress fund the 
NEO Surveyor Program as requested in the Fiscal Year 2024 
budget request and at the appropriate levels for years to come 
as we approach the 2028 launch date.
    NASA's research is no less vital than its planetary defense 
missions. The State of Arizona is a vital contributor to space 
physics, astrophysics, and other studies through Arizona State 
University and University of Arizona. Both universities has 
successfully supported NASA science missions for decades and 
provide a strong pipeline for future scientists and engineers 
to start careers in government and commercial space. That is 
why our work on the CHIPS and Science Act ensured NASA's 
reauthorization and incorporated provisions I helped draft to 
direct NASA to fund key science research at Arizona's 
universities. We must continue to provide resources to these 
and other leading institutions.
    The scientific research NASA leads, including through the 
Earth Information Center and other data-related initiatives, 
benefits Arizonans and all Americans right now, not 
theoretically in the future. NASA is a critical part of efforts 
to combat difficulties Arizona families face every day from 
water scarcity to extreme weather events and beyond.
    Space is no longer the exclusive domain of the Federal 
Government. Commercial space has invested heavily in Arizona, 
from Artemis manufacturing to the innovative new space program 
at Arizona State University. And just last month, Blue Origin 
recently opened a Phoenix office, specializing in avionics, 
systems engineering and supply chain management. This follows 
the opening of a Virgin Galactic manufacturing facility in Mesa 
last year, and expansion of existing facilities for Boeing and 
Northrop Grumman in recent years.
    It is absolutely essential that NASA has the resources to 
be an effective industry partner and that we continue to grow a 
thriving commercial space industry. Success in commercial space 
means American leadership and a center for rewarding careers. 
Those careers must be open to all, and this means making the 
right investments in STEM education. Finally, NASA needs the 
resources to hire and maintain a world-class workforce which, 
in turn, requires physical infrastructure. It is our job in 
Congress to ensure that the taxpayer money is spent wisely, and 
we must, therefore, be critical and ask the necessary questions 
to any budget request. But the responsibility to spend taxpayer 
money wisely also means that we are making sure the money is, 
in fact, spent where it must to help keep us safe, secure, and 
promote a healthy economy with rewarding careers.
    I look forward to asking Administrator Nelson questions 
today and working with NASA this Congress to continue helping 
Arizona and the American people. Thank you, Madam Chair. I 
yield back.
    The Chair. Senator Schmitt. Thank you.

                STATEMENT OF HON. ERIC SCHMITT, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI

    Senator Schmitt. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, 
Administrator Nelson, for joining us here today. It is great to 
be with you in this committee on this hearing focused on space, 
NASA, and exploring the final frontier. The story of Missouri 
is intimately tied to the exploration of the stars. Famous 
astronomer, Edwin Hubble, was born in Marshfield, Missouri, and 
the telescope dedicated in his name has forever changed our 
understanding of the universe. As ranking member of the 
Science--or the Space and Science Subcommittee, I look forward 
to working with you to progress the priorities of this 
committee. Of those, the one in front of us here today is 
NASA's reauthorization, and I am eager to work in a bipartisan 
fashion with you and the full committee chair and ranking 
member to hopefully get that across the finish line.
    Here in the United States, we are privileged to have a 
robust commercial supplier base at the foremost space flight 
companies in the world. Over 20 Missouri-based companies, from 
Joplin to Hazelwood, are actively supporting the Artemis 
mission to return man to the moon. As Ranking Member of the 
Space and Science Subcommittee, I want to do everything in my 
power to leverage the abilities of innovation that U.S. 
companies possess to maintain American space dominance. It is 
imperative that the U.S. and the appropriate agencies develop 
thoughtful, commonsense standards when it comes to the 
development and deployment of technologies related to orbital 
debris management, commercial space stations and other deep 
space waypoints, hypersonics, human landing systems, and the 
numerous other technologies necessary to get us back to the 
moon and beyond to Mars.
    I cannot emphasize enough--I cannot emphasize this enough. 
So much of this developing technology is just that, developing. 
Sadly, the default approach around this town, in my view, is 
what more can the government do, not less innovation thriving 
under the light torch of regulation, not the heavy hand of 
government. While I still have not--while I still have a lot to 
learn in this space--no pun intended--I, along with my staff, 
continue to hear from industry about how knee-jerk and 
untenable regulations have stymied U.S. leadership. This should 
not be anybody's goal, especially as foreign adversaries seek 
to undermine our efforts at every corner. On that note, I want 
to speak about the near and present danger of China. China's 
capabilities in space and beyond is alarming.
    Madam Chair, I would like to submit the following articles 
entitled, ``A Chinese Spacecraft Has Been Checking Out U.S. 
Satellites High Above Earth,'' and ``China Building Cyber 
Weapons to Hijack Energy Satellites, Says U.S. Leak,'' which 
highlight the ability of the CCP multi-directional satellites 
to stop and gather intel on U.S. space equities, and ``The 
CCP's Development of Cyber Weapons to Seize Control of U.S. 
Space Equities.''
    While I commend the Administrator for the many initiatives 
he will highlight in his testimony, I strongly disagree with 
this administration's obsession with misguided woke policies 
related to climate change and diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
Administrator Nelson, America cannot afford to take its eye off 
the ball with the rising threat of the CCP. There is simply too 
much at stake. President Xi and the CCP are hell-bent on 
dominating us on every front. We must be laser-like focused on 
our approach, and I can assure you that China has no interest 
in out de-eying us, and they are not intimidated at all by this 
divisive radical policy that has found its way in this budget.
    Madam Chair, thank you again for convening this hearing, 
and thank you to Mr. Nelson for appearing before us today. I 
look for today's hearing and the proceedings. I yield back. 
Thank you.
    The Chair. Thank you, and without objection, we will enter 
those articles into the record.

      A Chinese spacecraft has been checking out U.S. satellites 
                            high above Earth

                      Andrew Jones--March 3, 2023
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    An illustration of Earth showing how far away geostationary orbit 
is.

    A Chinese satellite launched in 2018 has been inspecting other 
nations' spacecraft high above Earth in geostationary orbit.
    Tongxin Jishu Shiyan Weixing-3 (TJS-3), named vaguely as a 
communications experiment satellite, was sent up into geostationary 
orbit in late 2018. It then released a small subsatellite, possibly to 
help test TJS-3's capabilities.
    Orbital data reveals that TJS-3 has been making close approaches to 
American satellites in recent months. For example, the Twitter account 
Orbital Focus notes that the satellite has been drifting along the 
geostationary belt, but pausing to take a closer look at satellites USA 
233 and USA 298, both thought to be military communications satellites 
operated by the U.S. Space Force.
    Satellites in geostationary orbit (GEO) operate at 22,236 miles 
(35,786 kilometers) above Earth, where their velocity matches the 
rotation of the planet and sees them appear fixed over one point on the 
surface below. This orbit is thus highly prized for its use for 
communications and other purposes.
    At the same time, a spacecraft that either raises or lowers its 
orbit a few tens of miles will be able to drift west or east respective 
to other satellites, allowing a satellite over time to sweep past 
others and take a look.
    Satellite Dashboard, a web tool that collates and analyzes space 
situational awareness (SSA) data, reveals that TJS-3 approached as 
close as 3.8 miles (6.2 km) to USA 233 on Oct. 31, 2022.

    This has led to a game in which countries aim to learn about each 
others' spacecraft and test their counterspace and SSA capabilities.
    Little is known about the TJS-3 satellite, but the U.S. and other 
nations will doubtless be watching its movements closely.

China building cyber weapons to hijack enemy satellites, says U.S. leak

    Classified CIA document assesses Beijing's ambitions to take 
control of communications critical to fighting wars

    China is building sophisticated cyber weapons to ``seize control'' 
of enemy satellites, rendering them useless for data signals or 
surveillance during wartime, according to a leaked U.S. intelligence 
report.
    The U.S. assesses that China's push to develop capabilities to 
``deny, exploit or hijack'' enemy satellites is a core part of its goal 
to control information, which Beijing considers to be a key ``war-
fighting domain''.
    The CIA-marked document, which was issued this year and has been 
reviewed by the Financial Times, was one of dozens allegedly shared by 
a 21-year-old U.S. Air Guardsman in the most significant American 
intelligence disclosures in more than a decade.
    A cyber capability of this nature would far exceed anything Russia 
has deployed in Ukraine, where electronic warfare teams have taken a 
brute-force approach with little effect.
    These attacks, first developed in the 1980s, attempt to drown out 
signals between low-orbit SpaceX satellites and their on-ground 
terminals by broadcasting on similar frequencies from truck-borne 
jamming systems such as the Tirada-2.
    China's more ambitious cyber attacks aim to mimic the signals that 
enemy satellites receive from their operators, tricking them into 
either being taken over completely or malfunctioning during crucial 
moments in combat.
    The classified U.S. document said this cyber capability would allow 
China ``to seize control of a satellite, rendering it ineffective to 
support communications, weapons, or intelligence, surveillance, and 
reconnaissance systems''. The U.S. has never disclosed whether it has 
similar capabilities.
    Taiwan, which has taken note of how indispensable satellite 
communications have been to the Ukrainian military, is seeking to build 
out communications infrastructure that can survive an attack from 
China.
    It is courting investors to establish its own satellite provider, 
while experimenting with non-geostationary satellite receivers in 700 
locations around Taiwan to guarantee bandwidth in the event of war or 
disasters, the Financial Times reported in January.
    In a sign of how crucial satellite communications have become in 
warfare, a Russian cyber attack succeeded in rendering thousands of 
Ukrainian military routers from US-based Viasat ineffective in the 
hours before it launched its full-scale invasion on February 24 last 
year. A Ukrainian official described the attack at the time as 
``catastrophic''.
    It also knocked out service to thousands of Viasat customers in 
Poland, Italy and Germany, where several hundred wind turbines were 
affected.
    The Viasat hack, while sophisticated, involved breaking into the 
company's computer systems and sending out instructions to the modems 
that caused them to malfunction.
    China's goals, according to the leaked assessment, are far more 
advanced. They would seek to knock out the ability of satellites--which 
tend to operate in interconnected clusters--to communicate with each 
other, to relay signals and orders to weapons systems, or to send back 
visual and intercepted electronic data, according to experts.
    US military officials have warned that China has made significant 
progress in developing military space technology, including in 
satellite communications.
    General B Chance Saltzman, commander of the U.S. Space Force, told 
Congress last month that Beijing was aggressively pursuing counter-
space capabilities in an effort to realise its ``space dream'' of 
becoming the foremost power beyond the Earth's atmosphere by 2045.
    ``China continues to aggressively invest in technology meant to 
disrupt, degrade and destroy our space capabilities,'' he said.
    Saltzman said China's military had deployed 347 satellites, 
including 35 launched in the past six months, aimed at monitoring, 
tracking, targeting and attacking U.S. forces in any future conflict.
    Charlie Moore, a retired Air Force general who served as deputy of 
U.S. cyber command, said China was making huge efforts to counter the 
asymmetric advantage that the U.S. had in the cyber and space domains.
    ``China understands the superiority that the United States has in 
the space and cyber domains, so they are very interested in not only 
improving their own capabilities but in capitalising on what we refer 
to as a first-mover advantage in both domains,'' said Moore, now a 
visiting professor at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.
    ``They are working on all the capabilities that they want to have 
from a defensive and offensive standpoint, and from an ISR 
[intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance] standpoint. They're 
firing on all cylinders,'' he said.
    The National Security Council, the CIA and the Pentagon declined to 
comment. The Chinese government had no immediate comment.

    The Chair. We will now turn to questioning, and, 
Administrator Nelson, I wrote to you in January about a 
manufacturing USA Institute, something that NASA could inform, 
is really an action that NIST would take. But in my State 
alone, we are looking at 60,000 STEM worker shortfall by 2026, 
and this notion of continuing our efforts on material science, 
I believe, is a key aspect of where we need to go.
    So NASA, NIST, industry need to continue to collaborate on 
what I think is training and skilling people in material 
sciences. Do you agree that NASA should help and work on these 
issues?
    Senator Nelson. Indeed I do, and another thing that you 
were looking at is thermoplastic composites as a new material 
that would not only help aviation industry, but also the space 
industry. And we have a NASA project going on on high-rate 
composite aircraft manufacturing, and we are working with the 
partners, obviously those in Washington State as well, to 
reduce the cost and increase the production rate of composite 
aircraft. You know, the Dreamliner, the 787, is built of 
composites, and it has a lot of advantages, including a weight 
advantage. And so this is a new kind of composite.
    So at your request, Madam Chairman, NASA, Commerce, Defense 
are developing recommendations to leverage the manufacturing 
here in America to accelerate our capabilities in manufacturing 
aerospace technologies, like thermal plastics.
    The Chair. Thank you. Thank you for that answer. I think 
there are some that believe we are falling behind to where 
Europe is on this R&D side of the equation, so thank you for 
your answer on that. I would like to ask a couple of other 
things. Obviously, you and I have had many conversations about 
NASA's need to continue with redundancy and making sure that we 
keep programs, you know, on schedule and reduce risks, and also 
the fact that we need a multi-year budget.
    The President's 2024 budget for NASA is a 7-percent 
increase over 2023, but your requested increases in the out 
year appear to be only 2 percent or less. So we think here in 
discussions, getting a 3- to 5-year authorization would help 
NASA on making sure that we do not fall behind in what we need 
to do to be competitive. Thank you for your detailed answer on 
thermoplastics. Many of our supply chain are making thermal 
plastic products today for the space sector, and so we 
appreciate that answer.
    But could you talk a little bit about a multi-year request 
and how do we stay competitive in redundancy?
    Senator Nelson. And I commend you for a multi-year 
proposal. It is true that the last NASA authorization bill, as 
Senator Cruz has mentioned, the two of us fashioned that. That 
was back in 2017. It is true that for that, one of the primary 
drivers was the NASA bill of 2010, which Kay Bailey Hutchison 
of Texas and I fashioned, that set us off on this course of the 
dual approach in our going back to the moon and to Mars. One 
track is government. The other track is commercial.
    And so I would welcome a multi-year approach to 
appropriations instead of in the past where it has been you get 
into the negotiation between the House and the Senate, and then 
you all cannot agree on this, and you have to accept what they 
want, but that is not the comprehensive approach. I think what 
you have said, a 5-year authorization bill, would be very, very 
well received in the aerospace community.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Sinema, I am turning the 
hearing over to you, and thank you for chairing. Oh my gosh. 
Totally forgot your opening statement.
    Senator Nelson. Well, I was going to shorten it and----
    The Chair. Totally. I jumped right into questions, and so 
we had such a dynamic here of members talking about all these 
priorities. Sorry. I apologize for not giving you the 
opportunity to make a statement.
    Senator Nelson. Well, let me--let me just see, Mr. 
Chairman, if I could hit some of the topics----
    The Chair. Please, go right ahead, Administrator. Oh my 
gosh.
    Senator Nelson.--that you four raised in your opening 
questions.

    STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON, ADMINISTRATOR, NATIONAL 
              AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION

    Senator Nelson. First of all, we have talked about 
aviation, and you are so right, and they are big things 
happening in aviation. Just for example, in Washington State, 
we have just announced with Boeing basically the plan to design 
the next 737 aircraft, which is the one that is most frequently 
used, single-aisle, medium-range, commercial transport. But 
this time we are going to do it by working with Boeing of 
designing a high, thin wing, high on the fuselage, and it is so 
thin that it needs struts to support it. But what this design 
is doing is giving, along with the improvement in the engines, 
a 25-percent greater efficiency. And, Senator Cruz, that would 
mean 25 percent less fuel, which is a good thing for the 
airlines, but might also be a good thing in the overall energy 
policy of the country.
    Senator Cruz, you mentioned the GHC. You and I in this 
committee have a different approach to what is happening to the 
earth's climate. It so happens that NASA is in the middle of 
this. Why? Because all those assets up there. We design them, 
we build them, we launch them, and we operate many of them. 
Others we turn over to like NOAA, and NOAA then, of course, has 
the National Weather Service.
    Now, the fact is that they are recording what is happening 
to the earth, and what you are specifically referring to is, in 
2022, the Federal Acquisition Regulation Counsel published a 
draft rulemaking. That is in the draft. There are three 
agencies involved: NASA, Department of Defense, and I think it 
is, which one? GSA. And so it is in the middle of taking 
comments, but there is a provision in there, if this will give 
you some satisfaction. There is a provision in there that I, as 
the NASA Administrator, can waive any requirements that might 
be in the rule with regard to small business, and small 
business is something that we take very seriously in our 
contracting and so forth. So I would ask you to continue with 
your advocacy of that position but look at the details in the 
proposed rulemaking, and it is in the hearing stage accepting 
comments.
    Senator Sinema, I brought show and tell. You raised this 
issue. This is DART. This was incredibly successful. We wanted 
to see if we could hit, bullseye, an asteroid. So we chose an 
asteroid that was about 100 meters in diameter that was 
orbiting about another asteroid that was about a half a mile in 
diameter, because if we hit it, we could then measure with our 
telescopes did we move it.
    This is DART. The size of DART is 4 by 4 by 4, so it is a 
relatively small spacecraft, but that spacecraft hit that 350-
foot wide asteroid at 16,000 miles an hour right on the money, 
and sure enough, it changed the orbit of that. And, therefore, 
we wanted to see if we could hit--if we discover a killer 
asteroid is headed for earth, would we have a chance of 
altering its trajectory by hitting it, and that brings this 
one: Arizona State NEO Surveyor. This is a 3D printing of what 
is the spacecraft. It is obviously much, much larger than this, 
and it will go in 2027, and it is going to be looking out there 
for killer asteroids that would endanger us. So this program, 
primary principal investigator is Arizona State. I have been 
there. I have talked to them, and so I wanted to bring you all 
up to date on that.
    And, Senator Schmitt, you raised the issue of China. We are 
in a space race with China. The staff of this committee has 
already received an intelligence briefing, and I would 
encourage you all to get that briefing to understand just how 
serious this space race is of getting on the moon. And I have 
said many times that--it is my old country law practice days--
possession is nine-tenths of the law. It is always possible 
that to get to the area that we are going to, the South Pole, 
where we think the resources are on the moon, especially water, 
and, of course, if there is water, there is hydrogen and 
oxygen, and you got a gas station. I would not want us to be 
there second because what is to say, if you recall the history 
of China, the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, and 
suddenly they are claiming that is their territory. I would not 
want to see them get there first and then claim this is our 
territory in the South Pole, you stay out. We go as an 
international mission. We go with international astronauts. We 
go with international participants in our scientific 
instruments. I want us to get there first.
    [The prepared statement of Senator Nelson follows:]

        Prepared Statement of Hon. Bill Nelson, Administrator, 
             National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and members of the Committee, 
I am pleased to be here to discuss the President's $27.2 billion 
request for NASA for Fiscal Year 2024. NASA has set a bold vision for 
the future, one defined by innovation and exploration throughout the 
heavens. This request will help prepare NASA to make that vision a 
reality, through investments in human and robotic exploration 
throughout our solar system, Earth science, groundbreaking technology, 
the next generation of air travel, and educating our Nation's future 
explorers. It's an investment to support good-paying jobs, businesses, 
and schools that partner with NASA in all 50 states. This request 
supports almost 150 missions, and I would like to highlight a few for 
you today.
    In November 2022, NASA took the first major step in America's 
return to the Moon with the Artemis I mission. That historic launch and 
25-day mission tested the Space Launch System, Orion spacecraft, and 
Exploration Ground Systems in preparation for Artemis II in 2024, which 
will carry humans beyond low-Earth orbit for the first time in more 
than 50 years. That mission will be followed by Artemis III in 2025, 
which will return astronauts to the surface of the Moon. The Budget 
requests more than $8 billion for the Artemis program, putting the 
Nation on a path to annual crewed missions to the surface of the Moon 
starting with Artemis IV in 2028.
    Through the Artemis campaign, NASA is partnering with the broadest 
exploration coalition in history, including multiple international and 
commercial partners. Together, we will continue to develop the 
technology and systems needed to live and work on and around the Moon 
in preparation for human missions to Mars. The Budget makes investments 
in the long-term architecture for Artemis, including enhancements to 
the Space Launch System, new ground infrastructure, the Gateway lunar 
space station, space suits, and competition in the Human Landing System 
program that will enable the first woman and person of color to walk on 
the Moon.
    The missions of tomorrow will be enabled by the technology 
development of today. With an investment of nearly $1.4 billion for 
space technology, the Budget funds development of communications and 
power systems needed for long-duration stays on the Moon. Investments 
in new capabilities like advanced propulsion and landing systems will 
enable humanity's next giant leap to Mars.
    The $4.5 billion request for Space Operations supports continued 
research on the International Space Station (ISS) with regular crewed 
missions to this orbiting laboratory through 2030. There, NASA 
astronauts conduct research on the risks associated with future deep 
space exploration missions and perform groundbreaking experiments on 
human health that benefit life on Earth. Increasingly, the ISS is 
hosting experiments that look back at Earth to help us observe and 
understand changes to the planet. The Budget positions NASA to continue 
the space station's legacy in low-Earth orbit after its planned 
retirement in 2030, with investment in the development of commercial 
space stations, while also investing in a U.S. capability to safely 
deorbit ISS at the end of its life. Collectively, these investments 
will pave the way for sustained American presence in orbit and create 
scientific and economic opportunities.
    In 2022, NASA had the world on the edge of their seats as we 
revealed the first images from the James Webb Space Telescope. The $8.3 
billion request for science will continue worldleading missions like 
Webb, Hubble, and Perseverance, as well as enable the next generation 
of great science with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, Mars 
Sample Return, Europa Clipper, Dragonfly, and more. The FY 2024 Request 
is the highest request for NASA science in history, supporting over 120 
NASA science missions and 10,000 U.S. scientists through more than 
4,000 openly competed research awards.
    Over the past three decades, much of what we have learned about the 
Earth system has been built on NASA satellite observations and 
research. The Budget will build on that legacy by funding the next 
generation of Earth observatories that will give us a 3D-holistic 
understanding the Earth's systems. The Budget request will make NASA's 
Earth Science data more accessible to Federal, state, and local 
governments, universities, researchers, and the public through the 
development of the Earth Information Center and other data initiatives. 
NASA's direct observations, made on and above Earth's surface, put 
humanity in the best position to measure and respond to changes in our 
environment while confronting challenges that impact all of humanity. 
Focusing our efforts on the Earth, planetary defense, orbital debris, 
and the safety, security, and sustainability of space will equip 
policymakers with the best information possible to protect our planet.
    Through ambitious experimental programs, including the X-57 
electric aircraft, X-59 low boom supersonic aircraft, and the 
Sustainable Flight Demonstrator, NASA is poised to revolutionize the 
future of air travel and keep U.S. industry competitive in the global 
marketplace. The Aeronautics budget request of almost $1 billion will 
put the U.S. aviation industry on a path to meet the ambitious goal of 
net zero emissions by 2050. We are accelerating research and 
development of aircraft technologies that are safer, faster, and more 
fuel efficient.
    NASA has always dared to make the impossible possible. To do so, 
the $158 million request for the Office of STEM Engagement will build 
the workforce of tomorrow by broadening student participation, 
expanding K-12 student engagement, and building partnerships to magnify 
our reach.
    NASA's success is made possible by our world class workforce and 
enabled by our physical infrastructure. The Budget request contains 
investments to ensure NASA infrastructure, laboratories and critical 
facilities are safe, secure, and mission ready. Robust investment in 
construction, revitalization, and maintenance of facilities is 
essential to ensure NASA can meet our mission requirements.
    The President's Budget request for NASA is an investment in our 
Nation's future. It is an investment in U.S. innovation and 
competitiveness, and it is an investment in our next generation of 
workers. It will prepare America to compete--and succeed--in the 21st 
century.

    The Chair. Thank you----
    Senator Nelson. Madam Chairman----
    The Chair. Thank you for that passionate opening statement, 
Administrator.
    Senator Nelson. I didn't get to the budget, which you asked 
about.
    The Chair. We will--we will get to that. I want to turn to 
my colleague, Senator Cruz, and then we will, again, thank 
Senator Sinema for chairing the rest of the hearing and for her 
leadership. She mentioned CHIPS and Science, and that was a key 
aspect of the CHIPS and Science Act. She played a key role in 
helping us get it over the goal line, and so appreciate it and 
appreciate your focus this morning. So, Senator Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair, and as I said, it 
is--it is good, Administrator Nelson, to have you back in the 
Committee. It is unusual to have you on that side of the dais.
    Senator Nelson. And by the way, thank you for coming to 
Houston for the announcement of the crew. This is a big deal, 
and, by the way, the crew is here today----
    Senator Cruz. Good.
    Senator Nelson.--and tomorrow and Thursday. And it is my 
understanding that I am going to be able to bring them to the 
Republican luncheon on Wednesday, and so I look forward to you 
seeing them there.
    Senator Cruz. Excellent, and they are so incredibly 
impressive, and we are proud of the courage that they bring in 
this incredibly important mission, going back to the moon, but 
also keeping our eyes focused that Mars is the objective, and 
getting to the Moon as an integral part of proving up the 
technology to go to Mars.
    I want to start by asking about, NASA has a long history of 
phasing down programs. And we saw with the space shuttle, with 
Constellation, that there can be real bumps in a phase-down. At 
some point, the International Space Station is going to need a 
phase-down. We have extended the time on that until at least 
2030, but at some point, that is going to have to happen. How 
do we avoid a brain drain, and how do we maintain the technical 
expertise and leadership we need when that time comes?
    Senator Nelson. First of all, understand that among young 
people, which we actively recruit in our intern program, the 
excitement about space--I often say, ``space is the place,'' 
but that is not some light statement. Look at any classroom in 
America, and look at the excitement in the areas of 
engineering, and mathematics, and technology, and science, and 
it is real. And what better way to get the young people of the 
country motivated than the Space Program? It was that way 50 
years ago in Apollo, and we are reviving that now again with 
Artemis.
    So I think as then, specifically to your question, how do 
we keep this going, in large part, it is going to depend on you 
all and the challenges that you all have in the next couple of 
weeks, and then the challenges as you get up to September the 
30th on the appropriation deadline for the next Fiscal Year, 
Fiscal Year 2024. But if the resources are there for us, then 
we are going to have this continuing program of going back to 
the moon, this time to learn, to live, to work, to invent, to 
create for the purpose of going further, going to Mars. That is 
going to generate a lot of excitement.
    When you combine that with all the science that is going 
on--I just mentioned DART and NEO Surveyor, the James Webb 
Space Telescope, and the discoveries that it is bringing, you 
mix all of that together, and there is going to be a continuing 
interest.
    Senator Cruz. You just rightly noted that--one of the 
challenges of ensuring NASA's exploration focus are the 
constraints of resources, and that has always been the case. It 
is worth noting that NASA's acquisition management has been on 
GAO's High Risk List for years, and GAO noted last year that 
``Continuing their recent trend, NASA's portfolio of major 
projects experience significant cost and schedule overruns, and 
more projects were added.''
    That is one of the reasons why I and every Republican 
member of this committee is so concerned about the proposed new 
greenhouse gas rule. It is estimated that rule will increase 
costs among Federal agencies across the board by almost $4 
billion, a significant portion of which will likely be borne by 
NASA. Has NASA done any calculations? Have you measured how 
much this new proposed rule will drive up the cost for all the 
companies that do business with NASA and, in turn, how much 
more that will drive up NASA's expenses and remove dollars that 
otherwise would be available to go to the moon or to go to 
Mars?
    Senator Nelson. In the process of the rulemaking, they are 
receiving comments, and then I will be able to answer your 
question specifically. But we cannot deny that NASA deals with 
climate, and, therefore, it deals with these greenhouse gases. 
That is what we have the instruments up there taking these 
measurements.
    Senator Cruz. But, Administrator Nelson, my question is 
just how much are you all driving up costs because of a 
political mandate from the White House? I will give you another 
example.
    Senator Nelson. I will get you an answer.
    Senator Cruz. One of the ``works in progress'' under 
``safety, security, and mission services'' within the budget is 
to implement a 5-year plan to transition NASA's entire fleet of 
more than 2,600 traditional combustion vehicles to all-electric 
vehicles. Has NASA done any cost estimate as to how much it 
will cost to get rid of 2,600 combustion vehicles, replace them 
with electric vehicles, and then install the charging 
infrastructure everywhere that will be needed for those 
vehicles?
    Senator Nelson. I will get you an answer, but if you are 
suggesting that we should abandon the entire national effort to 
move toward electric vehicles, I would say that there is a 
significant difference of opinion about that.
    Senator Cruz. What I am suggesting is NASA should stay 
focused on its core mission of going to space, and going to the 
moon, and going to Mars. And the extent to which--I understand 
this is a very political White House. I understand most White 
Houses are. The extent to which NASA salutes and jumps on board 
with those political objectives, that will significantly 
undermine not only the ability of NASA to have the resources it 
needs to keep building things to go to space, but it also--we 
have worked very hard--you and I have worked very hard to keep 
NASA out of partisan politics, and I would encourage you 
energetically to continue that work because we have got a 
Republican House of Representatives now. If NASA is seen as 
partisan, that is very bad for space and space exploration, and 
so I hope NASA will continue its tradition of staying out of 
those battles.
    Senator Nelson. And I assure you NASA is and will be if, I 
am around, not only bipartisan, but nonpartisan, and it will 
continue that way. Now, the reality is, Senator Cruz, and you 
know I love you, it is the fact that we have political 
differences, and it was on display in this very room over a 
number of years. But I can guarantee you that NASA is being run 
in a nonpartisan way.
    Senator Sinema. Thank you. Welcome again, Administrator 
Nelson. I will now recognize myself for a few round--a few 
questions.
    I am proud of Arizona's longstanding leadership in 
planetary defense, including addressing the threats of 
destructive near-earth objects, or NEOs, as you have discussed. 
In fact, the Catalina Sky Survey and Space Watch at Kitt Peak 
in Arizona have detected more than half of all of the 
identified NEOs. Unfortunately, to date, NASA has only 
identified approximately 42 percent of the NEOs larger than 140 
meters in size that could cause a devastating impact should 
they hit the earth. This is far less than the 90 percent by 
2020 that was required by the 2005 George E. Brown Junior Near-
Earth Object Survey Aircraft.
    However, the NEO Surveyor Mission led by Professor Amy 
Mainzer at the University of Arizona, would dramatically 
increase the rate of discovery of NEOs through a space-based 
infrared telescope optimized to find, track, and characterize 
the NEOS. Now I have strongly supported funding for this 
mission in the past, and I want to ensure that it is adequately 
funded to fly before the March 2028 deadline. So why is this 
year's $209.7 million budget request for the NEO Surveyor 
Mission, as well as continued support for additional funding in 
the future years, so essential to meet the statutory 
requirements and protect our planet from potentially harmful 
objects?
    Senator Nelson. We cannot identify every object. However, 
NEO Surveyor will be able to identify 90 percent of all the 
potential asteroids that are greater than 140 meters wide 
within the 10 years of the launch. Now, that is important 
because when you think of an asteroid that will do serious 
damage--millions of years ago, the asteroid that wiped out the 
dinosaurs was about 6 miles wide. If we can identify 90 percent 
of the asteroids that are 140 meters wide, then we are well on 
our way, but that is the technology that this will enable us to 
do, and launching it in 2027.
    By the way, there is a similar problem. Look at all the 
junk in earth orbit. There are a lot of pieces up there that 
are big, and they can do damage coming down through the 
atmosphere because they do not all burn up. We can only 
identify with existing technologies pieces that are larger than 
that in width. But something like that coming back to the 
atmosphere can still do a lot of damage.
    Senator Sinema. Thank you. Is NASA on track to meet the 
March 2028 launch readiness date required by the CHIPS and 
Science Act?
    Senator Nelson. Are we talking about silicon chips? Is that 
what the question is?
    Senator Sinema. So the CHIPS and Science Act required that 
NASA meet a launch readiness date. This was part of the 
reauthorization package that was inside CHIPS and Science, and 
the idea was that you would be ready to launch by March 2028.
    Senator Nelson. Which mission are we asking?
    Senator Sinema. The Surveyor. The NEO Surveyor.
    Senator Nelson. Is it not going in 2027? 2028.
    Senator Sinema. We are on track?
    Senator Nelson. We are on track.
    Senator Sinema. Great. Thank you. Arizonans face tremendous 
challenges from urban heat, water availability, and wildfires, 
and as you know, the CHIPS and Science Act directs NASA to 
pursue earth system observatory missions. So how will you 
ensure that these missions advance the critical science that 
will allow Arizonans to better plan, avoid, and mitigate these 
challenges?
    Senator Nelson. Well, the specific question is about--would 
you state that again?
    Senator Sinema. Sure. Thank you. So how will you ensure 
that NASA's missions around earth system observatory missions 
actually advance the critical science that allows Arizonans to 
better plan for issues like urban heat, wildfires, and water?
    Senator Nelson. OK. There are four great observatories that 
we are going to put up over the course of the next decade that 
will do what you just described, the Earth System Observatory. 
As a result of these, and, by the way, this is part of the 
science budget that I would urge you all to continue on. As a 
result of these, we are going to have a 3D compendium of 
everything that is happening to the earth in its land, in its 
water, in its atmosphere, and its ice, and how that is 
affecting everything on earth.
    For example, I had gone to Kansas for Senator Moran, and 
one of the reasons I wanted to go is that we have systems up 
there, including Landsat, but so much so with this Earth System 
Observatory, that the chairman has just mentioned, that can 
tell a farmer in his particular pasture crop, that particular 
segment of land, what is the moisture content of the soil. And 
as a result, it has the applications here on earth, all the 
more so when we put up these four great observatories giving us 
an understanding of what is happening to the earth, so much 
greater.
    I would just add one other example, and that is we can 
tell, for example disease in crops, but also disease in trees. 
And so we can warn that there is likely to be a wildfire in a 
particular forest as a result of the vegetation that we are 
detecting from space as being diseased.
    Senator Sinema. Thank you. Senator Schmitt.
    Senator Schmitt. Thank you, Madam Chair, and it is good to 
see you again. We had a great visit in my office, and I noticed 
you already pulled out the ``I am just a country lawyer'' line 
earlier, which is one of my favorites.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Schmitt. But anyway, it is good to see you again.
    I did want to ask you, you know, NASA has such a great 
tradition and reputation as relates to working with private 
industry for the development of new technologies, and you see 
this kind of innovation, and it is only continuing to grow. And 
we are on this--I mean, space has always been referred to as 
the final frontier, but we are continuing to push that 
envelope, which is--which is great. Could you give the 
Committee, or the three of us, I suppose, an idea of what you 
are doing or some specific efforts that you have employed as 
commissioner or the Agency in general to help foster that kind 
of innovation as Opposed to being an impediment, because this 
is one of the--you know, obviously, the great concerns is 
government getting too involved, potentially stymieing some of 
that innovation, and this is--you know, with space.
    I appreciate your comment earlier about China. I serve on 
the Armed Services Committee as well, and, you know, China is 
playing for keeps, and space is, you know, sort of ground zero 
for that competition that we are in. So just if you could walk 
through some of the things that you are doing that help foster 
innovation as opposed to hinder it.
    Senator Nelson. Our seed corn is research and development. 
We do not want to ever give that up, and that is the mission of 
NASA. It may be in space. It may be aeronautics. It may be in 
climate by what I just described. It may be looking for 
asteroids. It may be trying to understand these phenomenon that 
you are being briefed on in the Senate Armed Services Committee 
on UAPs. It has got a new name: unidentified anomalous 
phenomena.
    Senator Schmitt. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Nelson. It may be all of this, but it is the 
research and development that allows this country to move 
forward, so we see it in so many things. The reason it is going 
to accelerate and sustain itself is we do it not just as a 
government agency, but we do it with our commercial partners 
and now our international partners, and that all brings to the 
table a new mix of research and development, whether we are 
talking about space.
    Let's take the example there, our going back to the moon. 
Now we go and have already demonstrated, without a crew on the 
test flight, the Artemis Mission Number I, and the spacecraft, 
Orion, flying around the moon, we are putting a crew on. But we 
go with commercial partners because the third mission, we are 
going into lunar orbit. We are going to start to establish a 
lunar space station, and we are joining up with a commercial 
lander. The first winner of the first competition was SpaceX. 
We have a second competition that is just coming to a close, 
and the winner of that competition, so we--will be announced 
very shortly, and so we will have two landers. And, therefore, 
it is a public/private partnership.
    We also--to go back to the moon this time in a different 
way, we go with our international partners. That was not the 
case half a century ago. We did it as the U.S. Government. This 
time, even on the first crew, the ones that are coming here to 
Capitol Hill today, our first international astronaut is Jeremy 
Hansen, a Canadian F-18 Royal Air Force pilot. And so it is the 
beginning of these international crews. Now, on the 
International Space Station, we have been having international 
crews there ever since the late 1990s when we opened up the 
International Space Station.
    Senator Schmitt. Well, I appreciate that, and I am limited 
on time, but I do want to make the point in following up with 
some of the comments from Senator Cruz. And he was talking 
about climate, and you have indicated that China is a--is a 
serious threat competitor here. In the budget, it is worth 
noting that China is mentioned one time in the budget.
    [Cellphone ringing.]
    Senator Schmitt. ``Les Miserables.'' I hear the ringtone.
    China is mentioned one time, but climate and DEI-related 
items were mentioned 153 times in the budget. Talk about 
priorities, not that that is the litmus test, but my concern is 
in also serving on Armed Services Committee, we have had 
leadership of Senator Wicker as the ranking member, had a lot 
of questions to some political appointees to those positions 
about, again, this obsession with this political ideology. And 
NASA has had such a great reputation, I do not want to see NASA 
dragged into these political fights and the politicization that 
dominates everything. NASA has no business in that.
    So it is more of a comment than a question. I would urge 
you to rethink this--again, this administration's obsession 
with this divisive ideology that is now finding its way in 
military budgets, NASA budgets, and I just think it is 
completely wrongheaded, but thank you for your time today.
    Senator Nelson. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Sinema. Senator Wicker.

                STATEMENT OF HON. ROGER WICKER, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI

    Senator Wicker. Well, thank you very much, and it is great 
to see you again, Mr. Administrator, and I congratulate you on 
the great work you are doing. It may come as a total shock to 
you that I would want to ask about the Stennis Space Center. 
But you and I have worked on this world-class facility in the 
past, and I understand you have some words of encouragement 
about Stennis and other space centers as we transition to a 
different phase of NASA's long and very vital career. So what 
could you tell us on the record about that?
    Senator Nelson. The Stennis Space Center is a very valuable 
national asset because it is the location that, when we are 
developing exquisite new engines, we have to go to test them. 
And it is strategically located so that huge rockets can be 
delivered there on barges on the canals that once tested, and 
their motors in the integrated form can be put back on the 
barges and sent to the launch site wherever the launch site is.
    Now, the testing of rocket engines is not going to cease. 
It is going to continue, but they are new kind of rocket 
engines, so it is not just government rocket engines. It is now 
commercial rocket engines because, indeed, there is a very 
viable commercial space industry now, not only satellites but 
also rockets that are finding cheaper ways to get up to orbit 
because of exquisite new materials and manufacturing 
techniques.
    So I see a very bright future for the Stennis Space Center, 
and that future, I think, includes, because Stennis has so many 
thousands and thousands of acres of land so that its testing 
does not disturb the surrounding community, I think it becomes 
a multi-user space center--test center that will be utilized by 
many other users other than the U.S. Government. But beyond 
NASA, I think in the U.S. Government, there are many other 
users in the U.S. Government that will test in the future and, 
in fact, are beginning to test at Stennis.
    Senator Wicker. OK. Well, let me then transition to another 
aspect of this, and that is the budget for rocket propulsion 
testing. It has held steady. I would have preferred and been 
more reassured if that had been increased over time as only a 
0.8 percent proposed increase from Fiscal Year 2023 to Fiscal 
Year 2024. Where do you see that going, and giving the--given 
the unfunded infrastructure projects in our rocket propulsion 
test centers, is this funding request going to be sufficient to 
sustain the programs?
    Senator Nelson. I want to see it increase and, thus, all 
the more reason that you all need to keep us out of budgetary 
chaos. And I am not talking about in the next few weeks. I am 
talking about also when we get close to September the 30 and we 
need a new appropriations bill. So your question specifically 
is, are we going to have increased need of increased 
appropriations in order to provide the testing facilities for 
our space rocket, and the answer, in large part, is up to you.
    By the way, we have $5 billion of unmet needs on 
infrastructure. Fortunately, we were able to address some of it 
in an emergency appropriations for both Michoud and New Orleans 
as well as Stennis because of hurricanes. So in a hurricane 
supplemental, we were able to repair damage, but this is 
throughout all NASA's 10 senator--10 centers and 10 facilities. 
We are sucking air when it comes to the needs of 
infrastructure.
    Senator Wicker. OK. Well, I appreciate your answer, and, 
Madam Chair, I will yield back in a sentence or two. But I 
think what I hear you say is that, yes, we could and, in fact, 
need some additional appropriation in order for these testing 
facilities to meet the needs that we have. I certainly agree 
with you when you talk about continuing resolutions and the way 
they do not meet the needs and, in fact, waste--waste--billions 
and billions of dollars when we are forced to continue under 
last year's plan rather than move forward on what is actually 
needed. So I appreciate you working with us on this, and, of 
course, you do not have a stronger supporter of the Artemis 
Program and the space programs then many of the members on this 
side of the dais. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Sinema. Thank you. Senator Hickenlooper.

             STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN HICKENLOOPER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO

    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes, and thank you, Mr. Nelson. We 
have got some sort of a space object between us.
    You have referred a little bit to some of the risks and 
dangers of debris. The Orbits Act, which passed the Senate 
unanimously in the 117th Congress, would jumpstart a 
partnership with industry to figure out how we are going to 
develop the technologies to get this debris out of the LEO. I 
think it is--it is critical for tackling this problem that 
continues to grow.
    Now, other nations, including European nations, the 
Japanese space agencies have all established dedicated programs 
to advance their own debris removal technologies. Can you 
describe NASA's current efforts to address orbital debris and 
what you could call the orbital debris crisis, and how does 
NASA plan to maintain its global leadership in active debris 
removal?
    Senator Nelson. It is a real problem, and we are going to 
have some catastrophic consequences if we cannot get nations 
that are launching things into space to provide enough fuel to 
have a controlled reentry and, in fact, to have a reentry so 
that all the junk is not sitting up there. One of the obvious 
examples is the ASAT test that was done by China a decade ago 
put tens of thousands of pieces right in that zone of altitude 
of where a lot of our spacecraft are and, indeed, our 
International Space Station.
    Most recently, Russia as well about a year ago did an ASAT 
test, unbelievably putting junk into the very altitude where 
the International Space Station is, which they built with us 
and operate with us with their cosmonauts on board. And, in 
fact, we have had to move the space station to a higher 
elevation to get out of the way of junk that we can identify.
    And earlier in the hearing, I was saying that we can 
identify in low earth orbit objects that are that long or 
greater, but smaller stuff, we cannot even identify yet, and it 
is a real threat. I mean a speck of a paint chip coming at the 
right velocity at the right angle, you can imagine what it 
could do to a space suit on a spacewalk of an asteroid.
    So there has got to be not only our effort, and it looks 
like we have to lead the international effort, to be serious 
about designing everything that we are launching, that it has a 
minimal amount, preferably none, amount of junk that is going 
to be up in space, either to let it degrade and burn up on 
reentry, or to get it into a higher graveyard orbit----
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right.
    Senator Nelson.--where it is not going to threaten 
anything.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. I appreciate that. We are 
working on it as well to try and provide you the resources 
for--to make sure that technology does get developed in this 
country. Going to let you free range a little bit just with the 
last question, which you only have about 40 seconds. We have a 
whole bunch--over 200 Colorado companies have played a role in 
the successful Artemis I mission, supporting the development of 
a space launch system and the Orion spacecraft. The CAPSTONE 
satellite is owned and operated actually by a Colorado company, 
Advanced Space. I think they are still orbiting the moon as we 
speak sending back critical information for the Artemis 
mission. So just giving you an open palette, can you describe 
the value of the public/private partnership in our return to 
the moon? How is NASA engaging our industry partners to keep 
the human landing systems and the Lunar Gateway on budget and 
on schedule? And you are only going to have about--maybe you 
will get 5 extra seconds.
    Senator Nelson. Well, I----
    Senator Hickenlooper. You might have to--you might have 
to--actually, I should rephrase that. You might have to respond 
to that in a written since--now that I see that the----
    Senator Nelson. Well, I cannot say it in 5 seconds, but I 
can say that that mission that you are referring to, it is 
characterizing the orbit that eventually our Gateway or space 
station will go in.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right.
    Senator Nelson. It is a California--it is a Colorado 
company that, in fact, did manufacture the spacecraft, and what 
is illustrative, it was launched by a private rocket company 
that, albeit an American company, also it was launched from a 
foreign location, in this case, New Zealand. Rocket Lab is the 
company. And it is providing exactly information that we need 
that the government did not have to do it, but we need that 
information about this new orbit that we are going to put our 
Gateway Space Station in lunar orbit.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes, that is great. We are big fans. 
I yield back. Thank you.
    Senator Sinema. Senator Budd.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED BUDD, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA

    Senator Budd. Thank you, Chairwoman. Administrator, thank 
you for being here today. It is an honor to meet you. Thank you 
for your service. You know, this committee, as you know, is 
working through the FAA reauthorization. One area that I hope 
gets a lot of attention is next-generation aviation 
technologies. You know, in your testimony, I believe you 
mentioned the X-59 Low-Boom Supersonic Aircraft Program under 
NASA's aeronautics research arm. So that flight program could 
help unlock next-generation commercial supersonic flight 
through reduced noise pollution.
    For example, in Greensboro, North Carolina, North Carolina 
being the great state that I get to represent, boom supersonic 
plans to manufacture a commercial supersonic airliner that will 
revolutionize travel. So what is the current status of the X-59 
Low-Boom Program, and, specifically, how close is NASA to 
meeting its goals on designing and building the research 
aircraft and flying it over the U.S.?
    Senator Nelson. And your state is first in flight.
    Senator Budd. Thank you for that.
    Senator Nelson. The X-59, which is this extraordinarily 
super designed needle-nosed aircraft is going to fly at the end 
of this year. It will fly out of Edwards Air Force Base. Let us 
see. It is coming out of the Skunk Works at Palmdale, but I am 
pretty sure it is going to fly at Edwards, and what it will do 
is what you just said. It will fly supersonic but its design is 
such a radical design, that instead of pushing the bow wave 
going through the atmosphere, as you go from subsonic to 
supersonic, which causes that audible sound that goes ``boom, 
boom,'' it will, because of the design as you go supersonic, it 
will be a muffled roar.
    Senator Budd. Mm-hmm.
    Senator Nelson. And the whole thing is just what you said, 
designed to allow us to travel supersonic over populated areas. 
An obvious one would be from coast to coast. Now, back in the 
old days when they had the French Concord, which was Mach 2, 
two times the speed of sound, they didn't fly supersonic over 
the ocean, but when they got to the shores of either Europe or 
any other location, they had to slow down subsonic because of 
that ``boom'' being such a shattering sound.
    Senator Budd. So you hope to fly by the end of the year out 
of Edwards or Palmdale, but what data do you hope to collect, 
and how could a successful demonstration clear the way for 
aircraft manufacturers, like Boom in North Carolina, hopefully 
not just first in flight in our state, but first in 
supersonics, how could that help them to have regulatory 
certainty that there is going to be a market for overland 
supersonic flight?
    Senator Nelson. Well, as a matter of fact, specifically on 
that question, there are, in fact, private companies that are 
getting into the business now of supersonic transports, but 
they do not have this characteristic. So your question 
essentially is, is there a market out there in going into the 
headwinds from coast to coast that would normally take you 5, 6 
hours? Is there a market out there to cut that almost in half? 
And I suspect there is, and if you can do that----
    Now, you asked also about the testing. This thing is first 
going to be tested to make sure it flies, and then once they 
get through that, what we are going to do is a multi-year test, 
taking it to different locations all over the United States, 
and see if the muffled roar is acceptable to the people on the 
ground.
    Senator Budd. So, Administrator, that is the data you are 
looking for to see if it is acceptable to the public for 
overland flight?
    Senator Nelson. That is correct.
    Senator Budd. Thank you. Chairwoman, I yield back.
    Senator Sinema. Senator Lujan.

               STATEMENT OF HON. BEN RAY LUJAN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO

    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Madam Chair, and, Administrator 
Nelson, thank you so much for being with us today and for your 
continued service.
    Over the past several decades, Congress has created several 
agency-modified, nonprofit research foundations. Some of those 
examples, Administrator, are the National Fish and Wildlife 
Foundation, the Food and Agriculture Research Foundation, as 
well and most recently the Department of Energy foundation for 
Energy Research and Innovation. I believe that a foundation at 
NASA might help attract more partnerships, more public/private 
ventures and investments. And so my question, Administrator, is 
with an appropriate mission and funding, do you believe that 
NASA could benefit from a foundation to help develop public/
private research partnerships, and would NASA be able to use a 
foundation to enrich public education on space and provide 
awareness of its role?
    Senator Nelson. I do not know the answer to the question. I 
do know that, Senator, we do everything that we can to partner 
with not only commercial industry but also universities and 
other academic institutions. And it has been enormously 
successful, and the proof is in the pudding. You look at, for 
example, commercial crew to the International Space Station. 
That has cost NASA significantly less. Our partner, in this 
case, SpaceX soon to come Boeing with their Starliner, which 
should fly later on in the year for the first time with crew, 
it is on a fixed-price contract, and it delivers crew and cargo 
to the International Space Station. That was an employment of 
commercial activities, ingenuity, creativity in a way that NASA 
had never done, doing it all as a government program in the 
past.
    So, too, in our science research, we join up with 
commercial ventures as well as academic institutions. We put 
out a lot of grants, and we specifically, by the way, 
considering your state, we put those grants into areas that do 
not normally identify with the aerospace communities because we 
want the creativity of, in one example, rural communities, that 
creativity to be brought forth in the scientific research.
    So I think we have got the approach of a public/private, 
for that matter, international partnerships now that we are 
getting the biggest bang for the buck.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that response, sir. You are 
familiar with the NASA White Sands Test Facility out in New 
Mexico, Administrator, which was established back in 1962. It 
is 94 square miles located on the western slopes of the San 
Andreas Mountains, which is 18 miles north of our largest city 
in the area Las Cruces, New Mexico, and has supported the 
testing of space flight equipment for decades. Unfortunately, 
we know that site operations resulted in the release of 
hazardous substances, including volatile organic compounds from 
tanks and impoundments used to store waste materials.
    NASA is currently stabilizing the contaminant plumes so 
that it does not grow any bigger, but NASA's own modeling shows 
this method is not effective at removing all of the 
contaminants. Even after running the system for 100 years, 
model simulations show that contaminants are still present. 
Does NASA believe that it has a responsibility to fully remove 
the contaminants from the groundwater?
    Senator Nelson. Yes, sir.
    Senator Lujan. And, Administrator, can we expect NASA to 
identify additional restoration actions?
    Senator Nelson. As a matter of fact, we have already spent 
$200 million to date to address this groundwater contamination 
problem, and we are committed to continuing the investigation 
and evaluation, along with our partner, the New Mexico 
Environment Department.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that, sir. Administrator, I 
would like to follow up with your--you and your team on this 
particular issue. It does matter to us, and there has been a 
communication from myself and United States Senator Heinrich in 
the past, going back to 2022, to the Deputy Assistant Secretary 
of the Army asking about their role and responsibility. And at 
the time, the response that came back to us said that it was 
too early to assess damages. It has been about--you know, we 
are going to be coming up on a year here soon, but just want to 
make sure that we are on the same page, so I look forward to 
following up with you, sir.
    Senator Nelson. We are on the same page, and NASA owns and 
operates that local public water system, so we have every 
reason to continue this investigation.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that, sir. Thank you, Madam 
Chair.
    Senator Sinema. Thank you, Senator Lujan. Administrator 
Nelson, we have a few Senators who are on their way back. In 
the meantime, I am going to ask a few questions while we wait 
for them to arrive.
    The last time I was asking questions, I was asking about 
the CHIPS and Science Act as it relates to Arizona's unique 
climate issues, such as water, and heat--urban heat, so I want 
to kind of pick up on that. My question for you now is how will 
NASA ensure that all the data that is gathered through the 
Earth System Observatory, how can we ensure that it is 
available to all states, and tribes, researchers, et cetera, in 
a timely manner so that, in Arizona, we can address issues like 
urban heat and water availability?
    As you recall, the CHIPS and Science Act requires that that 
data be provided. Does NASA have a plan to do so in a timely 
manner?
    Senator Nelson. Yes, ma'am, and let me give you a specific 
answer to your question. Knowing that we have this great 
observatory that is being put up with four additional elements 
in addition to what we already have, and the specificity of 
information of what is happening to the earth and its climate 
that will result therefrom, yours truly said we have got to get 
this information out to everybody. And I knew the concept of a 
mission control center where everything is on display, so I 
said why can't we do this for all the information that we are 
bringing in from all of these assets that are up in space.
    What has come to be is our request that was funded the 
first time last year, we are asking for that funding this 
coming year, the Earth Information Center. And I see that not 
just as a physical location in many different locations where 
people could go, but I see that being offered virtually to 
everybody--school children, international partners, everybody. 
We are going to get a first glimpse of this because we have 
taken the east lobby of our building, which is a stone's throw 
from here, about 4 or 5 blocks away, and we are remaking that 
lobby into a very preliminary example of what an earth 
information center would offer, complete with a board that is 
constantly bringing information. That is going to be open in 
about 3 or 4 weeks, and so I want you to come and see it.
    And it is just an example of something to come, and that 
something to come it is going to be extensive information 
available at the touch of a click.
    Senator Sinema. Thank you. Arizona's major role in space 
extends to the private sector, and I am proud of the diversity 
of space companies in my state and everything that they are 
doing and accomplishing for the Nation. We have a robust 
business climate in Arizona and look forward to our commercial 
space partners' continued success. How does NASA plan to invest 
in the commercial space industry through large programs, like 
Moon to Mars or Artemis, that will drive innovation and 
competition?
    Senator Nelson. Everything that we are doing is being 
approached in this commercial public/private partnership. So if 
it is the example that Senator Lujan was talking about of going 
to the moon, we have a public/private partnership. The 
government is going to get there with Artemis, with the 
capsule, Orion, but then a commercial lander is going to 
rendezvous and dock, and the lander is going to take the crew 
to the surface. We see that in science. We see the commercial 
partnerships that are being done.
    Another example is the Senator from Colorado, Senator 
Hickenlooper, was talking about this Colorado private startup 
company. They have got an instrument in this new orbit that we 
are going into at the moon that is polar, it is elliptical, and 
we have never been in that kind of orbit. We are doing it 
because we are going to have constant ability to communicate 
with our spacecraft at the moon because it is not going behind 
the back side of the moon where we lose radio contact. A 
California startup instrument put up by a private rocket 
company is what has that instrument in that unusual orbit 
called the NHRO Orbit.
    Senator Sinema. Thank you. Senator Rosen.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JACKY ROSEN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Rosen. Well, thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate 
you calling on me, and, of course, Administrator Nelson. 
Senator Nelson, it is so good to see you here today and hear 
all the great things that you are working on. I want to talk a 
little bit about some things going on in Nevada because we have 
an area called Railroad Valley, which NASA has been asking for 
a land withdrawal on that.
    So last month, the Bureau of Land Management has approved 
NASA's application for the withdrawal of over 22,000 acres of 
public land in Railroad Valley. This area is located in Nye 
County. It is being used by NASA for calibrating satellites. My 
team has been told that this site is the only one of its kind 
in the United States and benefits critical research and 
national security initiatives.
    However, this area in Nevada is also rich with lithium and 
other critical minerals, and a number of clean energy companies 
are also looking to pursue projects there. These projects could 
help provide our domestic supply chain with critical minerals 
and further our clean energy goals. So I am, therefore, 
disappointed that up until now and the withdrawal announcement 
just last month, my office, Nye County, and other stakeholders 
have had a very difficult time learning about NASA's land 
request and getting in touch with your Agency. You know, over 
80 percent of Nevada's land is Federal, so communication for us 
is key in ensuring responsible multiple-use land management.
    And so can you--will you commit to improving NASA's 
communication about this effort with my office, Nye County, and 
other stakeholders as we look at the Railroad Valley land 
withdrawal and see what the impact is, and really work with 
Bureau of Land Management with the entities that are interested 
in developing there as well?
    Senator Nelson. Let me define the problem and give you the 
background. What does this area do? It is flat, and it has a 
reflective value because of the composition of the soil, that 
there are only three places in the world that have this: 
Nevada, China, and Libya, three others outside of the United 
States, including Israel. Israel, China, Libya, and this site, 
of which we calibrate our satellites by being able to beam to 
the earth and those beams come back in order for the satellite 
to be doing whatever it does. That includes the DOD and the 
NRO; in other words, the defense and the intelligence missions. 
Now, from a matter of national security and certainly for the 
operation of civilian satellites that we operate, we think this 
is of such an importance, that the United States would not have 
this access if we were to rely on trying to go to China to do 
this, or Libya, or, for that matter, our ally, Israel. And as a 
result, it is essential from a standpoint of national security.
    Now, your mining companies think that there is lithium 
there, and that ought to be explored, but not at the expense of 
our national security. And indeed, we have talked to your 
staff, certainly this committee staff, about this issue. Back 
last year, Senator Cortez Masto called me, and we talked at 
length about this very project. And to your question--am I 
committed to continue talking to you--yes, ma'am, I certainly 
am, and maybe I ought to come out there to Nevada and the two 
of us go take a look at this, and I would be happy to do that.
    Senator Rosen. Yes. We welcome you coming to Nevada. Like I 
said, over 80 percent of our land is owned or managed by--it is 
all public land, and so many different agencies have access to 
that. In the meantime, we also have to live with all of that 
and try to be sure that we are doing the right thing for 
national security and safety and for our folks in Nevada who 
live there. So I welcome your visit and to continue this 
conversation on this and other issues with aeronautical 
research, and the EPSCoR, and other things in STEM as well. So 
we will continue the conversation. Thank you so much.
    Senator Nelson. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Sinema. Senator Blackburn.

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE

    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Administrator 
Nelson, we are always happy to see you and appreciate that you 
are there today. I do have a couple of questions for you.
    Oakridge National Labs. As you are well aware, they are 
leading the charge on R&D when it comes to new materials, 
fuels, petrol solutions that are necessary for the Nuclear 
Thermal Propulsion Program and the success of that program. So 
what I would like to hear from you, as NASA and DARPA move 
forward with this interagency agreement, how will these two 
agencies continue to work through R&D that is critical to this 
program? How are they going to leverage the National Labs and 
continue to work with them so there is a continuum and a 
process for this research? And are they going to leverage that 
research from our National Labs to be certain that we meet 
those programmatic goals?
    Senator Nelson. Senator, this research is absolutely 
critical for us exploring the heavens. Under conventional 
technology, chemical propulsion, it would take us 6, 8, 
depending on the alignment of the planets, 10 months to get to 
Mars. We just simply cannot sustain a crew for that long, get 
to Mars, and then have to stay on the surface of Mars for a 
year or 2 years until the planets realigned in order for us to 
get back to earth in the same amount of time. And so we got to 
go faster.
    Nuclear thermal and nuclear electric are the two 
propulsions that can get us there a lot faster. May I say that 
for the first time, last year, we were able to get in the 
President's budget, albeit the Congress has been authorizing 
nuclear thermal research money, but we got everybody on the 
same page now, all asking for these technologies to be 
developed.
    Nuclear thermal, as you just pointed out, is the first one 
out of the gate, and it is a joint project between DARPA and 
NASA. By the way, this is low-enriched uranium. This is not 
weapons-grade uranium, and the heat that comes from that 
enriched/low-ridge enriched goes into making nuclear thermal 
propulsion or the other one, nuclear electric.
    It is my hope that we are going to get a joint project with 
other agencies that will start working on nuclear electric, but 
they are in Tennessee. You are involved with nuclear thermal, 
and that is underway as we speak.
    Senator Blackburn. Well, and I think we all look at this, 
and we know for a space force to be successful, we have to pick 
up the pace in this. I want to ask you also about the unmanned 
aircraft systems because your reauthorization last year gave 
you the opportunity to work in this space. And as you are doing 
some research work on the UAS, I would love to hear from you. 
We know the Chinese are very aggressive in this. Are you 
working with any Chinese drone manufacturers or not? What is 
your participation? Is there private sector participation with 
you in this program?
    Senator Nelson. Yes, ma'am. We are seeing in front of our 
eyes the change of air transport and mobility as a result of 
drones. Not only are we seeing the commercial use of these 
drones, but we are going to see the transport of humans, 
particularly in the urban setting. So if you want to go from 
downtown Washington to Dulles and you do not want to fight all 
the traffic, you will be able to get on a human-rated drone 
that will lift off electric propulsion and will take you out to 
Dulles. This will remake transportation in the urban setting 
and even short----
    Senator Blackburn. And are you working with any Chinese 
manufacturers or any Chinese-based research in these programs?
    Senator Nelson. Not to my knowledge. As a matter of fact, 
the----
    Senator Blackburn. Will you look further into that and 
confirm to us either yes or no?
    Senator Nelson. Of course.
    Senator Blackburn. Awesome.
    Senator Nelson. But let me say that we are well down the 
road working with American companies on this air mobility.
    Senator Blackburn. Excellent. Thank you so much. Thanks, 
Madam Chairman. I yield back.
    Senator Sinema. Thank you, Senator. Administrator Nelson, 
thank you so much for your participation today.
    The hearing record will remain open for 4 weeks, until June 
13 of 2023. Any Senators that would like to submit questions 
for the record should do so 2 weeks from now, by May 30 of 
2023. We ask that responses be returned to the Committee by 
June 13, 2023.
    And with that, our hearing is concluded.
    [Whereupon, the Committee was adjourned.]

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to 
                            Hon. Bill Nelson
Space Technology Development Funding
    The Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) is critical to the 
Artemis program and more broadly, to the commercial space industry. In 
partnership, STMD and commercial industry are developing the 
technologies we need to establish a sustainable lunar presence and 
develop a truly commercial economy in Low Earth orbit (LEO).
    Innovative technologies and space capabilities create jobs and 
opportunity in my state and across the country. For example, Ultra Safe 
Nuclear Corporation in Seattle received funding from the Space 
Technology Mission Directorate to develop advanced nuclear power and 
propulsion systems to propel humans to Mars and provide power to our 
astronauts on the Moon.
    Innovative technologies and space capabilities create jobs and 
opportunity in my state and across the country. For example, Ultra Safe 
Nuclear Corporation in Seattle received funding from the Space 
Technology Mission Directorate to develop advanced nuclear power and 
propulsion systems to propel humans to Mars and provide power to our 
astronauts on the Moon. The Directorate also funds space flight 
opportunities for industry start-ups such as Starfish Space in Kent, 
and Gravitics in Marysville to demonstrate important capabilities in 
orbit such as cleaning up dangerous space debris and maintaining 
privately operated facilities for in-space assembly and manufacturing 
(ISAM).

    Question 1. The STMD budget has been relatively flat in recent 
years and last year's appropriation provided over $200 million less 
than the President's Budget Request. This year's request restores most, 
but not all of the $200 million gap. Can you describe the impact of not 
fully funding STMD at the FY 24 request level on critical technology 
development activities and partnerships with industry?
    Answer. Not funding STMD at the FY 2024 budget request would 
negatively impact the development of crosscutting technologies that 
enhance capabilities and reduce the cost of space missions. For 
example:

  <bullet> Minimal funding for the Fission Surface Power (FSP) and 
        Nuclear Electric Propulsion projects, impacting the technology 
        development needed for Artemis and risk delaying the timeline 
        for living and working sustainably on the lunar surface

  <bullet> Cancelation of ongoing Technology Maturation projects, 
        impacting NASA's ability to deliver critical mission needs and 
        to do meaningful technology research and development 
        activities, and delaying delivery of surface technologies by 
        approximately 1 year;

  <bullet> Inability to award new Early Stage Innovation proposals, 
        impacting university partners conducting technology research 
        and development;

  <bullet> Cancelation of the 2023 Announcement of Collaboration 
        Opportunity (ACO) solicitation, rendering NASA unable to award 
        and initiate new ACO projects, further impacting partnerships 
        with industry and support to Artemis and science mission needs;

    Greater impacts to critical technology development should be 
expected if STMD is funded below the FY 2023, $1.2B, level, leading to 
cancellation of additional ongoing projects with strong industry 
partnerships.

    Question 2. What would be the impact to NASA's programs and 
infrastructure of falling below the growth rate requested by the 
President's budget request over the next five years?
    Answer. Cuts to the Science budget request could result in delay or 
cancellation of multiple missions currently in formulation. Lower than 
expected budgets will likely impact NASA's ability to issue new 
competitive opportunities across Science Divisions, impacting science 
communities across the country and their progress on critical research.
    Any cuts to the Exploration Systems Development budget request 
would impact NASA's ability to carry out the Moon to Mars lunar 
program. After the success of the Artemis I mission, NASA is at a 
critical juncture for human spaceflight. Significant efforts are 
underway to execute the Artemis II, Artemis III, and Artemis IV 
missions, all planned to occur within the next 4 years.
    Reductions from the FY 2024 budget request could result in delays 
to the Artemis IV launch. Artemis IV will initiate the sustained lunar 
operation model with Gateway's delivery to lunar orbit, initial Gateway 
expansion with International Habitat through the international 
partnership with the European Space Agency, and demonstration of 
sustained Human Landing System docking with Gateway for crew exchange 
and continued exploration of the lunar surface.
    Reductions could also force the Agency to terminate or not award 
contracts for new and ongoing systems production and development to 
support work on Artemis V and beyond. This could include not issuing 
planned awards for the Lunar Terrain Vehicle that would support mobile 
Lunar exploration and portions of the SLS and Orion production 
contracts for Artemis V and beyond. These actions could result in 
contractor layoffs. NASA could also be forced to halt/delay any Mars 
development efforts.
    In the area of Space Operations, cuts to the budget request could 
delay the procurement of the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle (USDV), potentially 
slipping the date of its availability to safely deorbit the 
International Space Station (ISS) in 2030. Reductions in funding to the 
Commercial LEO Development (CLD) program would delay the operational 
availability of one or more platforms NASA would otherwise use to 
continue its important exploration research efforts in LEO after the 
deorbiting of ISS and avoid a gap in U.S. human presence. Finally, a 
reduction in space station operations funding could require NASA to fly 
fewer crew and cargo missions to ISS, which would result in a reduction 
in the amount of research and utilization on orbit. In addition, budget 
reductions will impact the ability of the Space Communications and 
Navigation (SCaN) program to fully support Artemis and Science 
community missions, as well as address infrastructure shortfalls.
    Reduced funding for aeronautics could force NASA to cut investments 
in cutting-edge aviation technologies that will increase the speed, 
efficiency, and safety of air travel, and significantly reduce 
emissions.
    Reductions from the budget request would curtail technology 
development with commercial partners intended to increase U.S. space 
capabilities, stimulate the U.S. economy, and create jobs.
    NASA may be forced to reduce awards to Space Grant and other space 
STEM-related programs that educate our Nation's next generation of 
scientists, engineers, and explorers, decreasing participate by an 
estimated one million students and educators.
    The FY 2024 request provides needed funding for critical 
infrastructure needs. If the requested funding level is not sustained, 
NASA would be severely limited in its ability to right size its 
infrastructure portfolio and improve the overall health and reliability 
of its facilities and assets through the Agency Master Plan. There 
would also be a continued growth of NASA's Deferred Maintenance, with 
the most recent estimate growing to over $3.0B, the highest level 
ever.

    Question 3. Administrator Nelson, can you update us on the standing 
up of the new program office and implementing its Congressional 
requirements? Can you also explain how the office intends to 
incorporate capabilities provided by Artemis mission partners into the 
overall Moon to Mars architecture?
    Answer. The new Moon to Mars Program Office was established within 
the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate at NASA 
Headquarters on March 30, 2023. As directed by the 2022 NASA 
Authorization Act, the Moon to Mars Program Office focuses on hardware 
development, mission integration, and risk management functions for 
programs critical to the Agency's exploration approach that uses 
Artemis missions at the Moon to open a new era of scientific discovery 
and prepare for human missions to Mars. This includes the Space Launch 
System rocket, Orion spacecraft, supporting ground systems, human 
landing systems, spacesuits, Gateway, and more related to deep space 
exploration. The new office will also lead planning and analysis for 
long-lead developments to support human missions to Mars. Through our 
international and public-private partnerships, NASA will leverage 
capabilities provided by mission partners to build a sustainable 
Artemis architecture that creates a lunar exploration plan and 
establishes a clear path to the human exploration of Mars.

                            Hon. Bill Nelson
Growing the STEM Workforce
    For NASA to continue to innovate, we need to attract the next 
generation of engineers, inventors, chemists, biologists, astronauts, 
and so much more. That means ensuring that all American students 
receive the best training and education to compete with other economies 
around the world.

    Question 1. How is NASA leveraging its budget to build a more 
diverse STEM workforce, expanding K-12 student engagement, and building 
partnerships in the technology sector?
    Answer. NASA makes vital investments toward building a diverse 
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce. Our 
STEM engagement endeavors to attract, engage, and educate students and 
to support educators and educational institutions. Given the Nation's 
need for a skilled STEM workforce and projected demand, NASA clearly 
has a vested interest in attracting, engaging, and preparing its future 
STEM professionals. The national STEM ecosystem will benefit from NASA 
contributions to attract and retain students on STEM pathways, with 
increased attention on underserved and underrepresented students.
    NASA implements strategies to broaden student participation to 
increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in STEM 
through NASA opportunities and activities. While the number of women 
and underrepresented minorities earning STEM degrees has grown in broad 
science and engineering occupations over the last decade, significant 
underrepresentation remains in areas critical to NASA such as 
engineering and computer and mathematical sciences. NASA is committed 
to building a diverse, skilled future STEM workforce--our next 
generation of explorers with the technical skills needed to carry 
forward our Nation's vital mission and work in aeronautics and space 
into the future.
    Additional steps to improve STEM engagement among underrepresented 
students include the recent funding of more than $5 million to seven 
Women's Colleges and Universities (WCUs) to research and develop 
strategies that increase retention of women in STEM degree programs and 
careers. The agency's Minority University Research and Education 
Project (MUREP) created the Women's Colleges and Universities 
opportunity to help women overcome obstacles and barriers to working in 
the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. This award 
seeks to address the significant national gender gap and disparate 
experiences of women in STEM in the United States, both in higher 
education and the workforce. This funding opportunity asked Women's 
Colleges and Universities to take advantage of their expertise by 
developing programs that encompass academics, research, student 
support, college prep, career prep, mentoring, and more. NASA explores 
the unknown for all, and values diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility for the future STEM and agency workforce.
Food Security/Agriculture
    NASA has been at the forefront of applying Earth observation to 
address critical agricultural and food security challenges facing our 
farmers, ranchers, and food systems. NASA has partnered with the USDA 
to provide publicly available satellite images to estimate global 
growing conditions, such as soil moisture.

    Question 2. Do you agree that making this kind of data available to 
farmers can improve soil health and boost productivity?
    Answer. NASA, in partnership with the USDA, helps farmers and the 
agriculture industry in a variety of ways. For example, NASA's soil 
moisture data enables the assessment of existing conditions and the 
extent to which these conditions are localized or regional. Farmers and 
the agriculture industry integrate this information into groundwater 
models and crop models that use multiple NASA and ground observations 
(e.g., evapotranspiration, precipitation, ground and surface water 
supply, vegetation health). Integrating these data advances the 
agriculture communities' ability to provide crop condition forecasts, 
assess the risk of flash drought, provide irrigation decision support, 
and provide fertilizer management for efficient applications to reduce 
costs and protect the environment. This information enables farmers to 
assess whether farm management practices are improving soil health and 
supports efforts to maintain or improve crop yields.

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Kyrsten Sinema to 
                            Hon. Bill Nelson
NEO Surveyor Mission
    Thank you for your time and insights during the NASA FY24 budget 
hearing earlier this month. I was particularly grateful for our 
productive exchange on the NEO Surveyor mission and the critical role 
it plays in planetary defense. As you know, I have strongly supported 
funding for this mission in the past and want to ensure it is funded 
adequately this year and in the future to ensure it remains on track 
for the March 2028 deadline. I was very happy to hear NASA remains 
confident of that timeline and that the mission is a priority.
    As you also know, since the hearing a bipartisan compromise 
agreement to raise the Nation's borrowing limit and make changes to the 
Federal budget has been released. Specifically, the proposed text of 
H.R. 3746, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, would cap non-defense 
discretionary spending at $703.7B for FY2024 and $710.7 for FY25. This 
would impact Federal agencies across the board, including NASA.

    Question 1. Can you commit to maintain the NEO Surveyor mission as 
a NASA priority this year and into the future, including as discussed 
at the hearing and in the FY24 budget request, so that the mission 
remains on target to launch in 2028 and achieve its goals?
    Answer. In November 2022, NASA approved the NEO Surveyor mission to 
proceed into implementation with a committed launch date of no later 
than June 2028. The FY 2024 President's Budget Request supports that 
development schedule, and the mission is on track for launch. The main 
goal of the NEO Surveyor mission is to find two-thirds of potentially 
hazardous asteroids >140 meters within 5 years, and >90 percent of 
these in 10 years; the latter of which would fulfill the George E. 
Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey as contained in the NASA 
Authorization Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-155).
Budgetary Compromise
    In the FY24 budget request NASA set clear priorities for the agency 
to advance science, plant new boot prints on the Moon, and continue the 
study of climate change here on Earth, among other important 
initiatives. Although the ultimate contours of any budget compromise 
legislative remain to be finalized, it is inevitable that spending caps 
for FY24 and FY25 will have some impact on NASA.

    Question 2. Given this reality, are there are any general or 
specific areas of concern that you were unable to or that now differ 
from what you presented at the hearing? Are there particular programs 
or initiatives that must be prioritized or adjusted in light of this?
    Answer. Cuts to the Science budget request could result in delay or 
cancellation of multiple missions currently in formulation. Lower than 
expected budgets will likely impact NASA's ability to issue new 
competitive opportunities across Science Divisions, impacting science 
communities across the country and their progress on critical research.
    Without the levels of investment proposed in the Science budget 
request, NASA will struggle to move toward launching the complementary 
missions in its Earth System Observatory and undertake cutting-edge 
science necessary to assess a rapidly changing climate and mitigate 
natural hazards..
    Cuts to the Exploration Systems Development budget request would 
impact NASA's ability to carry out the Moon to Mars lunar program. 
After the success of the Artemis I mission, NASA is at a critical 
juncture for Human Spaceflight
    Significant efforts are underway to execute Artemis II, Artemis 
III, and Artemis IV missions, all planned to occur within the next 4 
years.
    Reductions from the FY 2024 budget request could result in 
substantial delays to the Artemis IV launch. Artemis IV will initiate 
the sustained lunar operation model with Gateway's delivery to lunar 
orbit, initial Gateway expansion with International Habitat through the 
international partnership with the European Space Agency, and 
demonstration of sustained Human Landing System docking with Gateway 
for crew exchange and continued exploration of the lunar surface. 
Reductions could also force the Agency to terminate or not award 
contracts for new and ongoing systems production and development to 
support work on Artemis V and beyond. This could include not issuing 
planned awards for the Lunar Terrain Vehicle that would support mobile 
Lunar exploration and some portion of the SLS and Orion production 
contracts for Artemis V and beyond. These actions could result in 
contractor layoffs. NASA could also be forced to halt/delay any Mars 
development efforts.
    Reductions could result in decreased investments in cutting-edge 
aviation technologies that will increase the speed, efficiency, and 
safety of air travel, and significantly reduce emissions.
    Reductions from the budget request would curtail technology 
development with commercial partners intended to increase U.S. space 
capabilities, stimulate the U.S. economy, and create jobs.
    NASA may be forced to reduce awards to Space Grant and other space 
STEM-related programs that educate our Nation's next generation of 
scientists, engineers, and explorers.
    The FY 2024 request provides needed funding for critical 
infrastructure. If the requested funding level is not sustained, NASA 
would be severely limited in its ability to right-size its 
infrastructure portfolio and improve the overall health and reliability 
of its facilities and assets through the Agency Master Plan. There 
would also be a continued growth of NASA's Deferred Maintenance, with 
the most recent estimate growing to over $3.0B, the highest level 
ever.
    Approximately 82 percent of NASA's infrastructure is beyond its 
design life, posing an elevated and rising risk to current and future 
missions. The result is NASA's infrastructure being run to failure 
rather than being repaired prior to failure when risk of failure is 
high.
Commercial Space and Workforce
    The Moon to Mars program, established under the CHIPS and Science 
Act, sets an ambitious goal to take the sustainability efforts in Low 
Earth Orbit and the Moon and translate them into a sustainable presence 
on Mars. The program will also provide an inspiration to future 
scientists and engineers to pursue careers in space, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics.

    Question 3. How will NASA help the commercial industry recruit and 
retain the robust and diverse workforce necessary to sustain this 
vision to set and complete ambitious goals for decades to come?
    Answer. A robust pipeline of skilled space workers is critical to 
achieving NASA's goals in LEO, cis-lunar space, and beyond. NASA is 
working with the National Space Council, industry, and local partners 
to develop pilot programs that would improve the pipeline of skilled 
technical workers to the space industry. These programs will also 
partner with academia to target technology gaps that market forces 
would not otherwise fill.

    Question 4. What role do you believe the commercial industry must 
play in inspiring future scientists and engineers to pursue rewarding, 
enduring space related careers? What can Congress do to ensure NASA has 
the resources to be a productive partner in these efforts?
    Answer. Contracting services from industry partners allows NASA to 
leverage commercial innovation and provide the best value to U.S. 
taxpayers while achieving our exploration and science goals. These 
partnerships also provide more opportunities for inspiring and exciting 
careers in the commercial space industry. By funding these programs, 
like the Commercial LEO Development program, Congress is supporting 
public-private partnerships that are developing systems and services 
for NASA's exploration efforts, as well as a broader space economy with 
many participants.
Commercial Suborbital Crew Systems
    NASA's FY24 budget request states that in FY24 ``NASA will begin to 
leverage commercial suborbital crew systems to fly NASA personnel to 
perform microgravity research and other testing and qualification for 
spaceflight hardware, as well as conduct astronaut training.'' 
Commercial vehicles offer NASA safe, reliable, and cost effective 
access to suborbital space.

    Question 5. Could you please provide an update on status and next 
steps for the program?
    Answer. The Suborbital Crew (SubC) activity will let NASA personnel 
take advantage of commercial suborbital vehicles to meet the Agency's 
microgravity research needs. NASA is currently focusing on the 
potential of crewed suborbital vehicles for scientific research and 
technology development. Suborbital vehicles can provide longer periods 
of microgravity for experiments than either drop towers or parabolic 
aircraft flights. While NASA does not plan to flight-certify the 
suborbital systems it uses the way it certified orbital Commercial Crew 
Program vehicles, we are working to ensure a thorough understanding of 
the safety of suborbital launch systems. Our current effort consists of 
conducting ``deep dives'' with vendors--including Blue Origin and 
Virgin Galactic--on their systems. Once we are satisfied with the 
safety of these vehicles, we will begin to leverage commercial 
suborbital crew systems to fly NASA personnel to perform microgravity 
research and other testing and qualification for spaceflight hardware. 
NASA currently provides funding for outside researchers to fly 
suborbital vehicles through its Flight Opportunities program. Using 
commercial systems to conduct its research will continue NASA's effort 
to enable a robust space economy.

    Question 6. Can NASA commit to ensuring there is no gap between the 
ISS and Commercial LEO Destinations (CLD) program operation and to 
letting Congress know if there is anything NASA needs to make the CLD 
program successful?
    Answer. NASA's goal is to align the ISS transition with CLD 
availability to ensure uninterrupted human presence in space. A 
commercial platform is expected to be available in the 2028 timeframe, 
enabling a two-year overlap with the ISS. The extension of ISS through 
2030 was a critical part of the CLD strategy and helps to prevent an 
interruption in human presence in LEO. In taking a phased approach and 
maintaining competition, NASA expects to have one or more commercial 
platforms on orbit in time to transition from ISS to CLDs. Continued 
Congressional support is critical to the success of the CLD program.
Unmanned Aerial Systems
    As you know, the CHIPS and Science Act directs NASA to research and 
test capabilities and concepts related to unmanned aerial systems.

    Question 7. Do you have an update on the progress made here and 
does NASA have the resources necessary to meet this obligation?
    Answer. NASA is jointly engaged with the FAA and industry to 
respond to the low altitude UAS Traffic Management Beyond Visual Line 
of Sight Advisory and Rulemaking Committee (UTM BVLOS ARC) 
recommendations. With the enacted FY 2023 appropriation for 
Aeronautics, NASA is jointly developing technologies with and 
delivering data to the FAA on three research transition products under 
the NASA FAA Research Transition Teams.
    Under the FY 2024 President's Budget Request, NASA will jointly 
partner with FAA and industry to continue technology development and 
delivery of performance requirements and data to inform standards and 
procedures development for UTM BVLOS.

                            Hon. Bill Nelson
Sustainability
    In November 2021, the United States released its Aviation Climate 
Action Plan, which outlined a commitment to reach net-zero greenhouse 
gas emissions from the U.S. aviation sector by 2050.\1\ NASA has 
identified the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs), and their 
incorporation into its operations, as a key pillar of its efforts to 
achieve net-zero emissions.\2\ Though the commercial aviation industry 
has begun incorporating SAFs into its operations, NASA's unique mission 
and operations are likely to present a special set of challenges for 
the adoption of SAFs, and ultimately a net-zero aviation economy.

    Question 1. Does NASA anticipate the incorporation of SAF into its 
operations being the primary driver of emissions reduction across its 
various missions and programs? If not, what is expected to be the 
primary driver?
    Answer. The 2021 Aviation Climate Action plan referenced in 
footnote 2 speaks to NASA's research and development efforts to help 
the aviation community achieve its net-zero emissions goals by 2050, 
rather than NASA's own operations. NASA has identified the adoption of 
Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), along improved energy efficiency via 
aircraft design and operational approaches, as a key pillar in helping 
the aviation community achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. NASA has an 
important supporting role in SAF development, as well as a leadership 
role in the improvement of energy efficiency to enable reduced fuel use 
and emissions.
    As with U.S. and global aircraft fleets, NASA's fleet will have to 
rely on SAF as the primary driver to reach net zero as SAF is, by 
definition, a drop-in conventional jet fuel replacement that can be 
used with existing aircraft. New, more energy efficient aircraft and 
operational approaches will be important to reducing required fuel 
amounts, costs and emissions but alone cannot achieve net zero.

    Question 2. How much SAF does NASA currently use to support its 
missions and programs?
    Answer. NASA has, in conjunction with both industry and the 
Department of Defense, conducted several tests and limited operations 
with multiple variants of bio-fuels. The amount of SAF used by NASA 
varies by test from year-to-year. For example: during a relatively 
large test planned for fall 2023, we anticipate using less than 75,000 
gallons of SAF. NASA uses SAF when SAF is the key aspect of the 
research, such as studying changes in emissions characteristics from 
different SAF's compared to conventional jet fuel.

    Question 3. How many gallons of SAF does NASA anticipate requiring 
annually in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050?
    Answer. The amount required for NASA missions in 2050 would be 
negligible (as it is today) compared to the estimated 35 billion 
gallons that would be required by the U.S. commercial fleet to achieve 
net-zero emissions by 2050. Thus, if the U.S. can meet the demand of 
the U.S. commercial aviation with SAF then there will be enough for 
NASA operations.

    Question 4. Has NASA identified a SAF pathway under ASTM D7566 that 
is most conducive for the agency's operations? If so, what is that 
pathway?
    Answer. At present, NASA does not have a readily implementable or 
uniform method to support a comprehensive transition. Presently NASA 
would use whatever approved SAF pathway, of the 7 currently approved, 
is available local to its specific operations and that its budget would 
afford, noting that SAF is currently significantly more expensive than 
conventional jet fuel.
Diversity and Inclusion
    People of color have played an important role in supporting NASA's 
missions and preserving American leadership in space. These individuals 
bring knowledge and expertise to science, technology, engineering, and 
math (STEM) fields that is critical to confronting emerging issues in 
space exploration. However, people of color continue to be 
underrepresented in STEM and NASA's work specifically. In February 
2023, NASA announced grants to eight Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities through the Data Science Equity, Access, and Priority in 
Research and Education opportunity to enable students and faculty to 
conduct innovative data science research.\3\ These grants represent a 
positive step towards improving STEM engagement among underrepresented 
students, but there is more work to do.

historically-black-colleges-universities

    Question 5. What additional steps is NASA taking to improve STEM 
engagement among underrepresented students and how have the agency's 
efforts improved upon previous initiatives?
    Answer. NASA makes vital investments toward building a diverse 
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce. Our 
STEM engagement programs endeavor to attract, engage, and educate 
students and to support educators and educational institutions. Given 
the Nation's need for a skilled STEM workforce and projected demand, 
NASA clearly has a vested interest in attracting, engaging, and 
preparing its future STEM professionals. The national STEM ecosystem 
will benefit from NASA contributions to attract and retain students on 
STEM pathways, with increased attention on underserved and 
underrepresented students.
    NASA implements strategies to broaden student participation to 
increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in STEM 
through NASA opportunities and activities. While the number of women 
and underrepresented minorities earning STEM degrees has grown in broad 
science and engineering occupations over the last decade, significant 
underrepresentation remains in areas critical to NASA such as 
engineering and computer and mathematical sciences. NASA is committed 
to building a diverse, skilled future STEM workforce--our next 
generation of explorers with the technical skills needed to carry 
forward our Nation's vital mission and work in aeronautics and space 
into the future.
    Additional steps to improve STEM engagement among underrepresented 
students include the recent funding of more than $5 million to seven 
Women's Colleges and Universities (WCUs) to research and develop 
strategies that increase retention of women in STEM degree programs and 
careers. The agency's Minority University Research and Education 
Project (MUREP) created the Women's Colleges and Universities 
opportunity to help women overcome obstacles and barriers to working in 
the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. This award 
seeks to address the significant national gender gap and disparate 
experiences of women in STEM in the United States, both in higher 
education and the workforce. This funding opportunity asked Women's 
Colleges and Universities to take advantage of their expertise by 
developing programs that encompass academics, research, student 
support, college prep, career prep, mentoring, and more. NASA explores 
the unknown for all, and values diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility for the future STEM and agency workforce.

    Question 6. What percentage of NASA's research expenditures are 
going to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and how have 
these funding levels changed in recent years?
    Answer. NASA's Minority University Research and Education Project 
(MUREP) is expanding NASA's reach in communities historically 
underrepresented in STEM by offering opportunities for college students 
at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to contribute to the agency's 
exploration goals and boosting these schools' research capacity and 
infrastructure. Through MUREP's competitive awards, research 
opportunities, and engagements at career fairs and conferences 
throughout the year, NASA is investing in the Artemis Generation and a 
diverse future workforce. MUREP's array of opportunities are available 
to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Hispanic-
Serving Institutions, Asian American and Native American Pacific 
Islander-Serving Institutions, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-
Serving Institutions, American Indian Tribal Colleges and Universities, 
Native American-Serving Nontribal Institutions, and other MSIs.
    MUREP is one of four Congressionally appropriated projects in 
NASA's Office of STEM Engagement. In FY 2018, MUREP received $32M, 
which was 32 percent of NASA's OSTEM budget of $100M. In FY 2023, MUREP 
received $45.5M, which was 31.7 percent of NASA's OSTEM budget of 
$143.5M. Therefore, over the last five years, MUREP's funding levels, 
as a percentage, have remained steady. NASA MUREP funding to HBCUs has 
seen a significant increase from FY 2019 to FY 2022. In FY 2019, NASA 
provided $6.8M to HBCUs, and this amount increased to $13.9 M in FY 
2022.
Stakeholder Engagement in NASA Exploration
    NASA works with many educational institutions, companies, and 
government agencies in its space exploration efforts. Institutions of 
higher education in Georgia, like the Georgia Institute of Technology 
and the University of Georgia, have established strong relationships 
with NASA to expand our understanding of space and build the pipeline 
of future NASA employees. Georgia also has a robust and growing 
aviation and aerospace engineering and manufacturing sector that has 
worked with NASA in many of its missions.

    Question 7. How does NASA envision integrating institutions such as 
universities, companies, and other government agencies into an overall 
cislunar exploration program?
    Answer. As NASA embarks on a new era of lunar exploration through 
the Artemis missions, it is more important than ever that today's 
students--the Artemis Generation--have opportunities to flex their STEM 
skills and tackle some of the most critical technological challenges 
ahead. NASA is committed to inspiring the students of the Artemis 
Generation and supporting the educators and caregivers who guide them 
to discover their own unique skills, interests, and capabilities. By 
investing in today's students, we are building the highly capable, 
diverse STEM workforce our Nation will need to accomplish our long-term 
goals in aeronautics and space exploration. A couple examples of 
connecting the Artemis Generation to NASA include:
    NASA's Next Gen STEM project produced a variety of resources to 
help educators excite the Artemis Generation about humanity's return to 
the Moon. The Artemis Camp Experience Guide, a set of hands-on 
activities telling the story of the Artemis missions, reached more than 
100K people. Through the Artemis Generation Spacesuits and Build, 
Launch, Recover educator guides, students will learn all about the 
development of spacesuits and find out how NASA prepares for launch and 
recovers the spacecraft when its mission successfully ends.
    Authentic, hands-on learning experiences give students a chance to 
test out their ideas and gain a whole new perspective on their own 
abilities. These student challenges and competitions are designed to 
spark the curiosity and determination of the Artemis Generation as they 
take on the challenges of space exploration. Challenges are available 
for students in middle school all the way through graduate school.
    NASA recognizes the critical importance of integrating a wide 
variety of institutions in its goal of bridging technology gaps and 
delivering innovative solutions to our cis-lunar missions.
    Through robust partnerships with universities, private companies, 
and other government agencies, we strive to ensure American leadership 
in aerospace while developing, demonstrating, and transferring new 
space technologies that benefit NASA, commercial, and other government 
missions.
    NASA utilizes various mechanisms to engage external institutions, 
including but not limited to: Space Technology Research Grants 
(STRG's), Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business 
Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) awards, NASA Innovative Advanced 
Concepts (NIAC), Center Innovation Funds (CIF), Tipping Point (TP) and 
Announcement of Collaboration (AOC) opportunities, the Flight 
Opportunities program (TechFlights), and the Game Changing Development 
(GCD) program. Information about these and other funding/partnership 
opportunities can be found at https://techport.nasa.gov/opportunities.
    In the state of Georgia, NASA has a strong partnership with the 
Georgia Institute of Technology as a lead Space Technology Research 
Institute (STRI) in the area of high-power electric propulsion systems. 
In addition to Georgia Tech, NASA works with the University of Georgia, 
and Clark Atlanta University on various technologies that will advance 
NASA's capabilities in cislunar space such as habitat optimization; 
terrain relative navigation, additive manufacturing, and in-space 
manufacturing. Through the SBIR program, STMD is working with the 
Global Technology Connection, Inc. of Atlanta, GA on data acquisition 
systems.

    Question 8. How can Congress support NASA in working with 
stakeholders to grow student engagement in space exploration and build 
the agency's workforce pipeline to include more individuals from 
underrepresented communities?
    Answer. Congressional support for the FY 2024 President's budget 
request would enable NASA to grow student engagement and make vital 
investments toward building a diverse Science, Technology, Engineering, 
and Mathematics (STEM) workforce. NASA's STEM engagement programs 
endeavor to attract, engage, and educate students and to support 
educators and educational institutions. Given the Nation's need for a 
skilled STEM workforce and projected demand, NASA clearly has a vested 
interest in attracting, engaging, and preparing its future STEM 
professionals. The national STEM ecosystem will benefit from NASA 
contributions to attract and retain students on STEM pathways, with 
increased attention on underserved and underrepresented students. 
Recent national and international tests show that in the last decade, 
U.S. students have demonstrated little or no growth in mathematics and 
remain ranked in the middle of advanced economies on international 
science and mathematics assessments.
    NASA implements strategies to broaden student participation to 
increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in STEM 
through NASA opportunities and activities. While the number of women 
and underrepresented minorities earning STEM degrees has grown in broad 
science and engineering occupations over the last decade, significant 
underrepresentation remains in areas critical to NASA such as 
engineering and computer and mathematical sciences. NASA is committed 
to building a diverse, skilled future STEM workforce--our next 
generation of explorers with the technical skills needed to carry 
forward our Nation's vital mission and work in aeronautics and space 
into the future.
    NASA is committed to inspiring the students of the Artemis 
Generation and supporting the educators and caregivers who guide them 
to discover their own unique skills, interests, and capabilities. By 
investing in today's students, we're building the highly capable, 
diverse STEM workforce our Nation will need to accomplish our long-term 
goals in aeronautics and space exploration.
Artemis Program
    The Artemis program represents NASA's strong exploration goals of 
establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon to prepare for missions 
to Mars. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (P.L. 117-167) provides 
tremendous support for NASA to continue making progress on Artemis and 
further human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit. The success of the 
Artemis I mission and the start of training for the Artemis II crew 
mark positive steps in pursuit of this goal. Despite strong progress by 
NASA, potential challenges to future success of the Artemis program 
have been raised. In its 2022 annual report, the NASA Aerospace Safety 
Advisory Panel raised NASA's safety culture as an area in need of 
improvement.\4\ The Panel used Artemis I as a case to represent NASA's 
need to facilitate better safety culture and encourage safety 
engagement from all levels of the agency. The Panel also noted that 
there is the potential for a significant reduction in the size and 
experience level of the NASA workforce following the completion of the 
Artemis I mission.

    Question 9. What are the biggest challenges to sustaining the 
Artemis moon missions going forward?
    Answer. Anything less than the FY 2024 requested funding for 
Exploration Systems Development will pose significant, adverse impacts 
to Artemis Missions. Significant content is currently in work to build 
upon the success of Artemis I with the Artemis II, III, and IV missions 
all planned to occur within the next four years. A topline reduction 
for exploration could force NASA to terminate, or significantly 
restructure, major development work such as Gateway, development of SLS 
Block 1B Exploration Upper Stage, EGS's Mobile Launcher-2, and HLS 
Option B contract. These actions could involve significant layoffs 
throughout the ESDMD contract structure. This could potentially 
endanger NASA's ability to achieve Artemis IV goals, the overall 
ability to deliver heavy lift capability, and could stop lunar 
exploration beyond Artemis IV.

    Question 10. How does NASA plan on facilitating a more proactive 
safety culture among all levels of the agency?
    Answer. The NASA has a proactive and robust Safety Culture Program, 
whose key elements include assessment, education, and engagement of the 
NASA workforce.
    NASA's Safety Culture is driven from the top down, from policy to 
practice. Our most recent survey responses from over 26,000 government 
and contractor employees show strong positive perceptions of safety 
culture with an average score of over 5 on a 6 points scale on all 
items.
    Survey debriefs, led by the NASA Administrator, were held with 
major head of organizations and discussed with all NASA executives.
    Safety Culture educational course, available to all employees and 
contractors, has been taken by more than 33,000 government and 
contractor employees, covering topics such as how to report and respond 
to safety concerns. NASA hosts an annual safety event alongside the 
Agency's Day of Remembrance. All new NASA executives are required to 
participate in the Executive Safety Leadership Panel, a multi-day, 
immersive experience to truly deepen every leader's appreciation for 
safety culture.
