        Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m. in room 
SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Maria Cantwell, 
Chairwoman of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Cantwell [presiding], Klobuchar, Rosen,

Schmitt, and Vance.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    Senator Cantwell. Good morning. The Senate Commerce 
Committee will come to order.
    This morning we are having a hearing on the Implementation 
of the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act.
    We are joined by the Acting Administrator Billy Nolen. We 
appreciate you being here.
    We are here today to measure the FAA's progress in 
implementing important safety reforms for aircraft 
accountability safety in the Act that was passed following two 
fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that claimed the lives 
of 346 people.
    I want to welcome members of what are the inaugural class 
of the Samya Rose Stumo National Air Grant Fellowship Program. 
This program, named after Samya Stumo, who was 24,lost her life 
in the March 10th accident crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 
302, reminds us why we need an aviation technical workforce on 
the Hill and throughout Washington, D.C.
    These talented young aviation technical experts with 
aerospace backgrounds will be assisting the FAA and Congress in 
meeting the complex technical challenges that we face in this 
field.
    I also want to recognize the families who lost loved ones 
in the two 737 MAX crashes. This Friday, March 10, will be the 
fourth year anniversary of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 
crash.
    I cannot begin to imagine their sense of loss and I know 
that time has not eased their pain, but we are offering our 
sincere gratitude for their unwavering dedication to helping 
this on aviation safety reform. Because of their support and 
critical input, the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and 
Accountability Act is now law and today we will hear from FAA 
Acting Administrator Bill Nolen about the FAA and what they've 
done to implement the 2020 Aviation Safety law, the Aircraft 
Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act.
    I will note that we wanted to do this prior to us taking up 
the FAA Authorization Bill. We want to get a good sense of 
exactly where we are on these issues before we dive in to 
things that we also want to evaluate as part of a 
reauthorization.
    We have seen near-misses and incidents that remind us that 
aviation safety requires constant vigilance and constant effort 
and although we haven't had a major U.S. crash in 14 years, we 
know we cannot assume that we've done everything as those MAX 
instances show us. The FAA must work harder.
    Three years ago, as was clear from the Committee's 
investigation in to the Indonesian and Ethiopian crashes, that 
our focused workforce and technical challenges have to be top 
of mind at the FAA, particularly as it relates to automation 
and human factors.
    The Safety Reform Bill that we passed obviously made major 
changes in the FAA direct oversight of the ODA members that no 
interference with FAA personnel or their designees could happen 
and that the FAA needed to build a technical workforce to make 
sure that those safety implementations as it relates to 
certification were called out from the very beginning of the 
certification process and that we improve safety by 
implementing safety system management systems.
    So today, Director Nolen, we are going to look to you to 
answer questions about that and obviously our concern that the 
law is still being too slow in its implementation.
    For example, the FAA has yet to complete a workforce review 
of the Aircraft Certification staff to identify and address any 
shortfalls in the agency's expertise. This is foundational. 
Emerging aviation technologies and future advances will only 
continue to press the FAA. So we need the best and most 
talented work force.
    The FAA must lead the world on safety and the FAA must 
build that workforce that is going to help us lead around the 
globe.
    Congress also put the FAA back in charge in oversight and 
approving and removing manufacturing engineers on behalf of the 
FAA. That means that they have the clear line of direction 
there. This requires a clear course of correction with the 
FAA's system of delegation and we want to hear about that 
progress. We've heard good reports, but we want to know that 
the FAA is continuing to back up these particular individuals.
    The FAA has begun work in reforming and continuing to 
oversee manufacturers on these key issues. So I plan to ask 
more questions about that.
    In the Committee's Aviation Safety Whistleblower Report, 
employees identified concerns with quality control at 
manufacturing facilities and with supply chains and we need to 
know that the FAA is fully using its compliance and oversight 
to make sure that we get at these issues.
    Earlier this year we called for the Department of 
Transportation, Office of Inspector General, to conduct an 
independent review of the FAA's implementation of the Safety 
Reform Bill. So their work is ongoing and we will hold 
obviously the FAA accountable to what the IG report says.
    So there's still much work to do. We look forward to 
hearing from the Acting Administrator today and for continuing 
to get the safety job done at the FAA.
    I'll now turn it over to the Ranking Member Senator Cruz.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED CRUZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS

    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Boeing 737 
MAX airplane crashed into the sea after it took off from 
Jakarta, Indonesia. Just 4 months later, in March 2019, yet 
another Boeing 737 MAX crashed after departing an airport in 
Ethiopia, killing all 157 people onboard.
    Today's hearing reminds us of the terrible toll those 
crashes took on the victims and their families as well as the 
life and death consequences of the FAA's aviation safety 
mission.
    Soon after the Ethiopian crash, I was among the first 
Members of Congress to call for grounding the 737 MAX. It 
needed to be grounded until aviation experts could determine 
what had caused the crashes and could guarantee that the flying 
public would be safe. I stand by that decision. It gave the FAA 
time to correct critical design flaws in the MAX and help make 
it safer.
    After multiple MAX investigations, it became clear that the 
FAA's Organization Designation Authorization or ODA process 
which gives manufacturers the authority to certify compliance 
with FAA design standards needed to be reformed.
    Reforms were needed to strengthen the FAA's oversight of 
the ODA process, to improve communication between ODAs and the 
FAA, and to prevent agency capture.
    The investigations also found a need to better address 
human factors in the overall design of aircraft in this era of 
increasing automation.
    In 2020 Congress enacted the Aircraft Certification, 
Safety, and Accountability Act or ACSA to require such reforms 
at the FAA. Just this week the FAA proposed a rule to implement 
a key provision of ACSA based on an amendment that I wrote that 
will close the safety gaps in the aircraft certification 
process by requiring amended type certificates to disclose all 
proposed changes in a single document. This is an important 
step to avoid confusion or miscommunication.
    This committee must remain vigilant in making sure that the 
FAA appropriately implements the safety reforms made in ACSA.
    It has been said many times aviation safety regulations 
have been written in blood. In the case of the reforms 
contained in ACSA that is tragically the case.
    Today I want to hear from FAA Acting Administrator Nolen 
what specific steps the FAA and the aviation industry are 
taking to ensure that we don't just respond to crashes after 
the fact, but that we are also taking proactive measures to 
prevent future tragedies.
    This committee should use the upcoming FAA reauthorization 
process to evaluate what additional reforms, if any, are needed 
to accomplish the goals of ACSA, but we should also use 
reauthorization to examine ACSA's regulatory impact on 
manufacturers, both large and small.
    Like practically every member of the Senate, I fly multiple 
times a week. The numerous recent near-misses by airlines just 
this year are very troubling. Since Administrator Nolen 
testified before us less than a month ago, there have been 
three more known near-misses. That's at least six so far this 
year.
    In response, Administrator Nolen is convening a Safety 
Summit with aviation leaders next week. I look forward to 
reviewing any recommendations that come from that meeting.
    The 737 MAX crashes and the problems at the FAA that were 
subsequently uncovered are stark reminders of why it is so 
important to have an FAA leader with deep technical expertise. 
You simply cannot entrust the role of protecting millions of 
Americans who fly with a person who needs on-the-job training. 
It's irresponsible.
    Unfortunately, that's exactly what we would have with 
President Biden's FAA Nominee Phil Washington. His hearing last 
week confirmed what's abundantly clear in his resume, that he 
lacks aviation experience needed to lead the FAA. He was unable 
to answer basic safety questions about the 737 MAX crashes, 
aircraft certification, or how a pilot might react when a 
system malfunctions, and it's no mystery why.
    Unlike other FAA administrators, including Administrator 
Nolen, who has decades of aviation experience, Mr. Washington 
has never flown a plane, has never worked for an airline, has 
never earned certificates in aviation safety, and it isn't just 
Republicans who raised concerns about Mr. Washington's lack of 
qualifications. At last week's hearing multiple Democrats on 
this committee did, as well.
    We need a trained aviation professional to be charged with 
keeping us safe and today, Mr. Nolen, I look forward to hearing 
the steps the FAA is taking to do just that.
    Thank you.
    Senator Cantwell. Acting Administrator Nolen, welcome. 
Thank you for being here. You're welcome to give an opening 
statement.

    STATEMENT OF BILLY NOLEN, ACTING ADMINISTRATOR, FEDERAL 
                    AVIATION ADMINISTRATION

    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you very much, Chair Cantwell, 
Ranking Member Cruz, and Members of the Committee. Thank you 
for the opportunity to be with you today to discuss how the 
Federal Aviation Administration is strengthening our 
certification and safety oversight processes and about our 
implementation of the bipartisan Aircraft Certification, 
Safety, and Accountability Act.
    Before we discuss certification reform implementation, on 
behalf of the United States Department of Transportation and 
everyone at the FAA, I want to recognize the families of the 
victims of the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airline crashes.
    March 10th marks the fourth anniversary of the loss of 
Ethiopian Flight 302 and all those aboard. Despite the passage 
of time, my colleagues and I have not forgotten.
    The FAA understands and embraces the importance of 
continuously raising the bar on aviation safety. During the 
past 2 years we've made significant progress meeting the 
requirements of the law to improve and refine our certification 
and safety oversight processes.
    We're using a comprehensive approach to implement the 
provisions from the certification reform legislation and the 
various recommendations received from investigations and 
independent reviews.
    We're treating aircraft as complex systems with full 
consideration of how all the elements in the operating system 
interact. We're integrating human factors considerations more 
effectively throughout all aspects of the design and 
certification process.
    We're improving the agency's oversight process by ensuring 
coordinated and flexible flow of data and information, and, 
finally, we are recruiting a workforce that can meet the 
demands of the future.
    It is more important than ever that we maintain our safety 
record while making improvements that will help sustain our 
progress. Before we get to your questions, I want to provide a 
little more detail on our accomplishments and I'd like to 
highlight some of the specifics of our work, especially our 
advocacy for safety management systems or SMS throughout all 
aspects of aviation.
    SMS is a systematic and comprehensive way to identify and 
manage risk and drive behavioral changes through increased 
transparency. As required by the Act, we published a Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking to require SMS for certain design and 
manufacturing organizations, Part 135 operators, and Air Tour 
operators conducting operations under Part 91.
    Because we recognize the value of implementing SMS as 
quickly as possible, the FAA has enabled stakeholders to 
develop and stand up voluntary SMS programs while rulemaking is 
underway. As of today, we've accepted more than 60 SMSs for 
Part 135 operators, Part 91 Air Tour operators, and Part 145 
repair stations. We accepted another five SMSs for design and 
manufacturing organizations, including Boeing, and working with 
many more toward acceptance.
    One of the key things of the certification reform 
legislation was ensuring that we incorporate the lessons 
learned in the months following the Lion Air and Ethiopian 
crashes.
    The FAA has fully embraced the direction of Congress in 
this matter and is driving changes throughout the certification 
process. For example, the Act requires the FAA to make 
extensive and meaningful changes to the Organization 
Designation Authorization or ODA Program.
    To address these requirements, we now require FAA approval 
of individual ODA unit members for certain ODA types. We 
established a policy to prevent interference with ODA unit 
members. Our ODA Office now employs approximately 50 people 
with expertise in these areas.
    We also recognize that the FAA must be able to keep pace 
with the wave of innovation as new entrants continue to develop 
novel air transportation projects.
    Through our Center for Emerging Concepts in Innovation, we 
have expanded efforts to support certification of new aircraft 
and technologies, including structured pre-application 
engagement with companies to identify a clear path to 
compliance.
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, I want to assure you 
and every member of the Commerce Committee that the FAA is 
fully committed to the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and 
Accountability Act. As we continue this work, we will maintain 
a posture of transparency and accountability, including 
providing regular briefings with the Committee and other 
stakeholders across the industry.
    Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Nolen follows:]

       Prepared Statement of Billy Nolen, Acting Administrator, 
                    Federal Aviation Administration
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and Members of the Committee, 
thank you for the opportunity to be with you today to discuss how the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is strengthening our 
certification and safety oversight processes and our implementation of 
the bipartisan Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act 
(``Act''). Before we discuss certification reform implementation, on 
behalf of everyone at the United States Department of Transportation 
and the FAA, I want to recognize the families of the victims of the 
Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents and thank them for their 
continued advocacy for aviation safety.
    The FAA understands and embraces the importance of continuously 
raising the bar on aviation safety, not only in the U.S., but around 
the world. During the past two years, we have made significant progress 
meeting the requirements of the law to improve and refine our 
certification and safety oversight processes. Using a comprehensive 
approach to implementing the provisions from the recent certification 
reform legislation and the various recommendations received from 
investigations and independent reviews,\1\ we have rededicated our 
processes to treat aircraft as complex systems, with full consideration 
of how all the elements in the operating system interact. We are 
integrating human factors considerations more effectively throughout 
all aspects of the design and certification process. We are improving 
the agency's oversight process by ensuring coordinated and flexible 
flow of data and information. And finally, we are recruiting a 
workforce that can meet the demands of the future--by hiring new talent 
who understand the safety implications of new and innovative 
technologies, as required by the Act. We will continue to prioritize 
this important work as we carry out our responsibilities for public 
safety. It is more important than ever that we maintain our safety 
record while making improvements that will help sustain our progress. 
The discussion below provides an overview of some of our 
accomplishments to date.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Including investigations conducted by Department of 
Transportation (DOT) Office of Inspector General, National 
Transportation Safety Board, etc. and independent reviews conducted by 
the Joint Authorities Technical Review, DOT Special Committee, 
congressional committees, etc.

  <bullet> Safety Management Systems (SMS). SMS is a systematic and 
        comprehensive way to identify, monitor, and address potential 
        operational hazards early on, to prevent serious problems from 
        occurring. U.S. airlines have been required to have SMS since 
        2018. Expanding SMS to other players in the aviation industry 
        is critical for achieving the next level of safety. As required 
        by the Act, we recently published a notice of proposed 
        rulemaking (NPRM), which proposes SMS requirements for certain 
        design and manufacturing organizations. Recognizing the 
        importance and value of SMS, we included Part 135 operators and 
        air tour operators conducting operations under Part 91 in NPRM 
        as well.\2\ As rulemaking is underway, we continue to promote 
        participation in voluntary SMS programs. These participants 
        submit elements of SMS to the FAA for acceptance; and commit to 
        regular oversight of their SMS by the FAA. As of today, we have 
        accepted more than 60 SMSs for Part 135 operators, Part 91 air 
        tour operators, and Part 145 repair stations; and accepted five 
        SMSs for design and manufacturing organizations, with many more 
        working towards acceptance. The FAA is using the lessons 
        learned from these voluntary programs to inform FAA's SMS 
        rulemaking and policy development.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ RIN 2120-AL60, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Safety 
Management Systems published on January 11, 2023. https://
www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/01/11/2022-28583/safety-
management-systems. FAA is seeking public comment on the NPRM until 
March 13, 2023.

  <bullet> System Safety and Human Factors. In accordance with the Act, 
        we incorporated system safety assessments and validation of 
        human factors assumptions into the FAA's aviation safety policy 
        and oversight, including the design and certification process. 
        We recently published an NPRM that proposes new requirements on 
        how to conduct system safety assessments for transport category 
        airplanes.\3\ We are also working on several initiatives to 
        increase the incorporation of human factors to improve the way 
        systems account for the broad range of pilot capabilities 
        around the world. For example, pursuant to the Act, the FAA 
        completed a preliminary review of human factors rules, 
        guidance, and pilot response assumptions to identify and 
        prioritize changes to better incorporate system safety analyses 
        and human factors assumptions into the FAA's aviation safety 
        policy and oversight. Finally, the FAA launched a call to 
        action to review revisions made to pilot certification 
        standards. The group provided recommendations on how to improve 
        manual flying skills and automation management, and the FAA is 
        in the process of implementing these recommendations.

Assessments for transport category airplanes published on December 8, 
2022. https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/12/08/2022-26369/
system-safety-assessments

  <bullet> Global Collaboration. Global collaboration is crucial to 
        maintaining U.S. leadership in aviation safety. The FAA 
        continues to participate in the International Civil Aviation 
        Organization (ICAO) Personnel Training and Licensing Panel 
        Automation Working Group, which is assessing the pilot 
        dependency on automation globally. The FAA is also leading an 
        international authority working group to evaluate the Act's 
        requirements regarding amended type certificates. This working 
        group recently recommended process improvements based on more 
        than a decade of harmonized application of changed product 
        rules. We are working to implement these recommendations. The 
        Act requires the FAA to ensure that pilot operational 
        evaluations for transport category airplanes include foreign 
        and domestic pilots of varying levels of experience. In 
        response, the FAA issued a notice in 2021, to update the policy 
        to include pilots in Flight Standards Board operational 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        evaluations.

  <bullet> Data. As the aviation system evolves, the FAA is constantly 
        considering options to improve data accessibility and foster 
        collaboration in order to share data on identified risks 
        throughout the government and with the public. FAA continues to 
        expand the agency's capability to collect, consolidate, 
        analyze, and share safety data within the FAA and with aviation 
        and transportation stakeholders and international partners. 
        Data enhances the FAA's ability to identify and respond to 
        potential safety issues and to better identify safety trends in 
        aviation. It is key in our efforts to move to a predictive 
        system, not just preventative. The FAA continues to improve the 
        Aviation Safety Information and Sharing (ASIAS) database, 
        including incorporating rotorcraft data and voice data from air 
        traffic control to support safety analyses. Pursuant to the 
        Act, we have worked with the Transportation Research Board to 
        identify, categorize, and analyze emerging safety trends in 
        aviation and completed the first required report in August 
        2022. We have also partnered with the National Aeronautics and 
        Space Administration to establish the framework for real-time 
        data monitoring.

  <bullet> Integration of Certification and Oversight Functions. The 
        Act requires the FAA to form an interdisciplinary project team 
        for any type certificate project for transport category 
        airplane. The FAA's Integrated Program Management team includes 
        subject matter experts from Flight Standards and the Aircraft 
        Certification Service who make recommendations to improve 
        oversight during aircraft certification and operational 
        evaluations. As the team finalizes recommendations, they are 
        already integrating best practices into certification projects 
        and ensuring proper integration on those projects. In February 
        2022, the FAA expanded the Technical Advisory Board (TAB) 
        process for all new and amended type certification projects for 
        transport category airplanes, and applied this new approach to 
        the Boeing 777X certification program. We also established the 
        FAA Compliance Program Executive Council to monitor the 
        operation and effectiveness of the Compliance Program, and I 
        received the second report earlier this year.

  <bullet> Culture of Safety and Excellence. The safety culture at the 
        FAA is one that promotes continuous improvement of safety 
        systems and outcomes, while providing support for employees and 
        industry stakeholders to self-disclose safety issues and 
        noncompliance. These efforts include promoting the voluntary 
        safety reporting program (VSRP) among other efforts, and 
        recruiting talented staff. VSRP empowers all Aviation Safety 
        (AVS) employees to confidentially report safety concerns 
        without fear of reprisal or other repercussions.\4\ We recently 
        completed the first AVS safety culture assessment, which 
        included surveys of AVS employee's opinions about safety 
        culture and the implementation of VSRP. The FAA is reviewing 
        the results to determine what actions may be needed in response 
        to the data. We have also hired specialized staff within the 
        AVS organization and provided training to increase competencies 
        on human factors. FAA will continue to evaluate the safety 
        culture and implement measures to improve collaboration between 
        employees and management to identify and address safety 
        concerns.

  <bullet> Delegation. The Act requires the FAA to make extensive and 
        meaningful changes to the Organization Designation 
        Authorization (ODA) program. As required by law, we now require 
        FAA approval of individual ODA unit members for certain ODA 
        types, and established a policy to prevent interference with 
        ODA unit members. The ODA expert panel was established in 
        December 2022, and we held the kickoff meeting for the expert 
        panel earlier this month. Finally, the ODA Office within AVS 
        now has approximately 50 employees and is tasked with 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        overseeing the ODA system across all of AVS.

  <bullet> Certification and Continued Operational Safety Processes. 
        Ensuring the safety of aviation products through certification 
        is an important function of the FAA, and we are enhancing the 
        type certification process. This includes revising guidance and 
        criteria used for determining significant changes to best 
        ensure that proposed changes to an aircraft are evaluated from 
        a whole aircraft-level perspective, including human interface 
        elements. Pursuant to the Act's requirements, we recently 
        published an order that outlines the aircraft certification 
        service issue resolution and appeals processes.\5\

  <bullet> Innovation. Aviation is incredibly dynamic, and it is 
        imperative for the FAA to accelerate and enable the deployment 
        of new technologies to reduce barriers and promote innovation 
        that enhances the safety and efficiency of air transportation. 
        Through our Center for Emerging Concepts and Innovation we have 
        expanded efforts to support certification of new aircraft and 
        technologies, including structured pre-application engagement 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        with companies to identify a clear path to compliance.

    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, I want to assure you, and each 
member of the Commerce Committee, that the FAA is fully committed to 
the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act. As we 
continue this work, we will maintain a posture of transparency and 
accountability, including providing regular briefings with the 
Committee and stakeholders across the industry.

    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Acting Director.
    Prior to this, you were the Head of the Aviation Safety 
Program which is about 7,400 people at the FAA, is that 
correct?
    Mr. Nolen. That's correct.
    Senator Cantwell. And some of this may have been involved 
with this, some of it isn't?
    Mr. Nolen. That's correct.
    Senator Cantwell. OK. So on the certification, what 
concrete steps have been taken to investigate any alleged 
conflicts of interest or pressures on the FAA staff?
    Mr. Nolen. We've done a couple of things and thank you for 
the question, Chair Cantwell.
    We've done a couple of things. Certainly one of the first 
things we did for the agency itself, we stood up a Voluntary 
Safety Reporting Program for AVSM employees. We've undertaken a 
cultural survey which was completed late last year and I've 
received those results as Acting Administrator.
    We're going through those results now to ensure what the 
climate of our AVS principally, our inspectors, our engineers 
on that side. We've also published a policy on not interfering 
with ODA unit members, and we're increasing the number of human 
factor specialists within AVS.
    `So we've got a body of work. We've certainly got a ways to 
go to make sure we've got the AVS complement where we want it 
to be, but what I can say is that we to date, as of today, 
we've got 7,489 people within AVS. We plan to take that to 
7,775 by the end of this Fiscal Year, and we're moving to 
ensure we've got the kind of competencies and skill sets we 
need to go forward.
    Senator Cantwell. Congress created new civil penalties in 
this area for interference. Has FAA taken any action in 
enforcement related to that?
    Mr. Nolen. I get a regular report from our Office of Audits 
and Investigation. To date, I am aware that we've done a civil 
penalty, but I can tell you that I sit down on a regular basis 
and review every case that comes through our Whistleblower 
Office.
    Senator Cantwell. Do you think there are further steps that 
need to be taken?
    Mr. Nolen. I think as we continue to reinforce safety 
culture, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, around safety 
management system, we must continue to do everything to make 
sure that we have absolutely a culture of transparency, 
communication, and cooperation across all lines of business 
within the agency.
    Senator Cantwell. So you've entered a rulemaking now, is 
that correct?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am, we have.
    Senator Cantwell. And so what will that entail in 
implementing a safety system?
    Mr. Nolen. So for safety management systems, so as we go 
through this--let me just say one of the things we've already 
done as in the last year we now have the final rule of SMS for 
airports and we realized the entirety as an ecosystem and while 
a lot of the focus has been on Boeing and rightfully so, we're 
looking across the totality of the industry to make sure that 
as the safety management system.
    I can tell you firsthand, having lived in that world for a 
lot of my professional career, that a very robust safety 
management safety will give you the kind of regulatory 
compliance and the ability to stare into risk and provide 
meaningful corrective actions. I've seen that work firsthand.
    Senator Cantwell. When will this be fully implemented at 
Boeing as a manufacturer or other manufacturers?
    Mr. Nolen. So Boeing and all of the major manufacturers in 
the U.S. currently have accepted voluntary SMSs and they are in 
work.
    Senator Cantwell. Overseen by the FAA?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am. I can tell you--matter of fact, I 
was just at Boeing last month and our people have complete 
access to not only all of their production system and that's 
almost on an ongoing daily basis. So we are seeing the work 
from their SMS and not only theirs but others, as well, but it 
would be better for us to make sure that this is the rule of 
law so that it applies to the entire industry.
    Senator Cantwell. So when will that be implemented?
    Mr. Nolen. We expect the NPRM will be done by this year and 
we'll then work to get that to a final rule.
    Senator Cantwell. OK. I'll have more questions on this. 
Thank you.
    Senator Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Administrator Nolen, as you know very well, 346 people were 
killed in two horrific crashes because Boeing and the FAA took 
their eye off the ball when it came to certification of the 737 
MAX.
    In response, Congress enacted ACSA to ensure that what led 
to those two crashes would not happen again. It has been over 2 
years since ACSA's enactment and we now have the opportunity to 
reflect.
    Aviation safety isn't static and it's not something we can 
take for granted. Instead, we have to be constantly looking to 
identify safety trends and find areas that can be improved.
    In your opinion, have the reforms that Congress has enacted 
already sufficiently addressed the prior safety concerns in the 
wake of the MAX?
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, Senator Cruz, for the question.
    I do believe so. Number 1, we readily accept the direction 
that Congress provided to the agency on this point. We have 
enacted over 60 percent of the requirements of ACSA and we are 
working very purposefully to ensure that we get them all done.
    We are starting to see the benefits again with the uptake 
in the number of SMSs that are in place. As I spoke to earlier, 
nearly 60 plus five among the major design and manufacturing 
organizations. We're starting to see that level of transparency 
that we always expected to have.
    There is more work to be done. We want to make sure through 
our oversight process that our engineers, our inspectors, our 
managers in the field feel that they are getting the right kind 
of information, whether it be from an airline or whether it be 
from an OEM, and we will continue to do that. The work is never 
going to be done. We're just continuing to work that, sir.
    Senator Cruz. So the Chairwoman and I are working together 
on an FAA reauthorization which will provide an important 
opportunity to make further safety reforms that may be 
necessary.
    `In your judgment, are there aspects to either FAA's 
authority or discretion or direction from Congress that needs 
to be changed or improved in the area of certification?
    Mr. Nolen. Sir, thank you for the question.
    We believe that one of the areas we'd like to see is the 
SMS for Part 145 operators. As we're working through the 
progress, that's one that is not in that proposal. We have it 
for Part 135. We have it for Air Tour operators, and we have it 
certainly for OEMS.
    We believe that's something we'd love to be able to work 
with you on that for Part 145 repair stations.
    Senator Cruz. OK. That's helpful. Let me ask you just on 
Monday in Boston, two United Airline planes clipped wings prior 
to take-off. Also on Monday, a passenger on a United flight 
again going to Boston, I don't know what it is in the water in 
Boston, was arrested after trying to open a door mid-flight and 
stabbing a flight attendant with a broken-off spoon.
    What the heck is going on in air travel?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, sir, thank you again. Thank you for the 
question.
    Let me just address the unruly passengers. We have set a 
zero tolerance policy around unruly passengers, misconduct in 
the air, and I can assure you that we will take every step, 
every tool that we have at our disposal to ensure that the 
action takes place against any perpetrator. It is just simply 
not allowed.
    Senator Cruz. So what would have happened if he had 
succeeded in opening the door mid-flight?
    Mr. Nolen. Let me just say, sir, that on a pressurized 
flight, it's a plug-type door. So it is over-pressurized. He 
would not have been able to open the door in flight while it's 
pressurized.
    That being said, still it's not the kind of behavior you 
would expect to see.
    Senator Cruz. Well, that's encouraging. Let me ask a 
different set of questions.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes.
    Senator Cruz. Mr. Nolen, you're a pilot, is that right?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir.
    Senator Cruz. How many airlines did you work for prior to 
being at the FAA?
    Mr. Nolen. Three.
    Senator Cruz. Three. Which ones?
    Mr. Nolen. American Airlines, Qantas, and West Jet.
    Senator Cruz. And at those airlines, what was your role, 
and did you work specifically in aviation safety?
    Mr. Nolen. I had multiple roles. I was in Regulatory 
Affairs at one point in my career at American Airlines. I was a 
training captain at one point in my career. I worked in 
Executive Safety and Group Health during my role at Qantas. I 
was the Vice President of Safety, Security, and Quality during 
my time at West Jet.
    Senator Cruz. You know, a point I would make, particularly 
to my Democrat colleagues on this committee, as you listen to 
Acting Administrator Nolen testify today, ask yourself a simple 
question. Do you think Phil Washington could come anywhere 
close to Acting Administrator Nolen's expertise and knowledge? 
I think the honest answer would have to be no.
    I think this is an agency that is incredibly important. It 
is literally entrusted with protecting our lives and the lives 
of our children and the Biden Administration needs a Senate-
confirmed Administrator of the FAA and I would encourage the 
Chairwoman and the Democrats on this committee. I think it's 
clear Phil Washington is not going to have the votes to be 
confirmed and I think the White House should withdraw that 
nomination and nominate someone like Acting Administrator 
Nolen.
    This is a nominee who, by all appearances, has the 
qualifications we expect for someone to lead the FAA and in the 
interest of the flying public, I think a nomination like Mr. 
Nolen would likely receive widespread bipartisan support and I 
would expect he would be confirmed quickly, and I hope that 
calmer voices in the White House prevail and that they go 
forward with the nomination that can succeed.
    Senator Cantwell. Senator Wicker.
    I want to just say again thanks to Senator Wicker for all 
his work in getting the Safety Bill. He was chairman of the 
Committee at the time and we worked collaboratively many, many 
months on this legislation. So thank you again for that, and 
many other members of this committee worked on it, as well.

                STATEMENT OF HON. ROGER WICKER, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI

    Senator Wicker. Well, thank you for those kind words, Madam 
Chair, and yes, it did take an all-out effort on both ends of 
the dais by many, many members.
    Just briefly before I get into whistleblowing, do you have 
the workforce you need to implement ACSA, and do you have the 
funds you need to get the personnel you need?
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, Senator Wicker, for the question.
    I really appreciate the support that both you and Chair 
Cantwell have given the agency.
    I do believe we're on a pathway. We've done a deep diving 
on what are the skill sets that we need. We've got within a 
hundred numbers of our federally authorized number within the 
AVS, and as I mentioned earlier, we're on a course to have an 
additional--we're going to go up to 7,775 by the end of this 
year.
    We're bringing on another 75 engineers on the Certification 
side. We're hiring more safety inspectors. We're hiring more 
chief scientists and senior technical specialists. So we think 
we're on a pathway. We think we have the right sets.
    Senator Wicker. OK. Well, let me just do that. Supplement 
your answer, if you will, because I want to get on to 
whistleblowing, and I'm going to read my question to try to get 
it all in and let you respond.
    When I was Ranking Member of this committee, we collected 
investigative information for 57 whistleblowers. The 
investigation released by this committee found that common 
themes among whistleblower allegations: insufficient training, 
improper certification, FAA management acting favorably toward 
operators, and management undermining the front-line 
inspectors.
    The investigations concluded that these trends were often 
accompanied by retaliation against those who report safety 
violations and a lack of effective oversight resulting in a 
failed FAA safety management culture.
    ACSA sought to address a number of these concerns by 
establishing an ombudsman, renaming the Office of Audit and 
Evaluation as the Office of Whistleblower Protection and 
Aviation Safety, and enabling the newly renamed office to 
investigate claims of whistleblower retaliation.
    Has the FAA worked to improve accountability, aviation 
safety, and whistleblower protections, and according to a 
report released just in January of this year by the Office of 
Inspector General at DOT, there are four specific actions that 
the FAA needs to take in order to ensure compliance. FAA 
responded to this report and concurred with the Inspector 
General's four recommendations.
    Can you please update us on how FAA plans to improve AAE's 
compliance with the statutory requirements of ACSA?
    I will list the four specific actions if you need for me 
to.
    Mr. Nolen. No, sir. Well, thank you again for the question.
    So as the Committee may be aware, the Office of Audit and 
Whistleblower, if you will, that is a position that's appointed 
by the Secretary. That position reports to the Administrator. I 
have ongoing meetings at least twice a month, unless there's a 
need----
    Senator Wicker. Is it fully staffed and up and running?
    Mr. Nolen. It is fully staffed and is up and running. Yes, 
sir.
    So we take it very seriously, the role for whistleblowers, 
and I see every case that comes before me. Specifically, as you 
talk about, I believe you're talking about oversight cases for 
different airlines. I believe that's what you're referring to.
    Much of that work we've agreed with the findings of the 
Office of the Inspector General. Many of them have been closed 
out for those that happened. We are working to ensure that we 
get those closed out.
    At the same time we are working to ensure that our 
inspectors, be it at an OEM or at an airline, ensuring that 
they've got the skill sets, the level of oversight, any 
additional training that we need to do to ensure that they are 
discharging their duties correctly.
    I think there was an issue about whether or not they had 
done their own independent analysis. So I want to make sure--
now I will say to the Committee a good robust SMS would ensure 
compliance with the regulations, but we need to make sure that 
our inspectors have done their own analysis and they should be 
able to come to the same conclusion and where we have a gap, we 
will go work on that.
    Senator Wicker. Well, OK, let me just say this and I say 
this to the Distinguished Chair. I take this very seriously. 
This is a lot of information concerning really abuse of 
whistleblowers. I think transparency is important.
    There is no place in the FAA or the Federal Government for 
retaliation for people who come forward with legitimate 
information and so I hope you will follow the timeline and I 
hope you'll get back to us if you have any problems because 
this is something that was considered serious enough that was 
placed in the statute and those adjustments were made.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir. You have our commitment that we'll 
follow up.
    Senator Wicker. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Senator Moran.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JERRY MORAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM KANSAS

    Senator Moran. Chairwoman, thank you very much, and thank 
you, Member, for this hearing.
    Mr. Nolen, thank you for being with us and for your 
service.
    Just a few questions. The MAX 737 tragedies highlighted the 
critical importance of better understanding human factors and 
their integration into the aircraft certification process.
    Can you say today that the FAA and global aviation 
community has a better understanding of human factors and its 
co-existence within the certification process?
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, Senator Moran, for the question.
    I can say we've made a lot of progress in this space. We 
are working. One of the things is that we're working with the 
universities to help inform the work that we do and, 
particularly within your state, we have a project with Emory-
Riddle. We have a project with Wichita State where we're 
looking specifically at human factors and human factors 
assumptions.
    As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we see the aircraft 
as a system and that level of interplay, when you put a pilot 
within a system and how he or she interacts, especially as 
we've seen rapid advancements in technology, rapid advancements 
in innovation, rapid advancements in automation.
    We've also, as required by the Act, as we see new work on 
certification, we now require system safety analysis that our 
FAA team must go through and validate the assumptions made by 
the OEM and in this case we're specifically talking about 
Boeing.
    So any assumptions made about the technology itself and how 
crews might react to it from the human factors perspective, I 
think we're in a better place than we were, but this is an area 
we'll continue to work on.
    Senator Moran. Is the science there yet?
    Mr. Nolen. The science is there. I've spent the better part 
of my career, which is one of the things I've loved about 
aviation safety and being in the AVS organization which is 
where I started, which is where I'll return, is that I look 
across the arc of my career from my early days of flying Army 
helicopters to later on commercial, and I've watched the 
progression of human factors and our ability when we talk about 
men, machine, or human-machine interface.
    We've come a long way, but we recognize we can never be 
static and we can never take the lessons learned for granted 
and we can see as technologies continue to evolve that our 
human factors, capabilities, and assumptions have kept pace.
    Senator Moran. Mr. Nolen, I don't know whether you and I 
should be nervous or not, but everybody else has left the room 
up here. Maybe that gives me more time.
    The Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act, 
we authorized $75 million to the FAA to recruit and retain 
engineers, safety inspectors, human factor specialists, and 
other experts.
    I'm an appropriator and an authorizer in this regard. 
Adequate funding levels, I think certainly the key to success 
at the FAA has many factors. Leadership is one of them, but the 
leadership capable of providing a workforce that's highly 
educated, motivated, and trained.
    My understanding is the workforce at the FAA is relatively 
new with a lot of turnover that's occurred over the years.
    Are you capable of--you've been asked this question before, 
but have we given you the resources to hire and do those 
employees, potential employees exist, and are you able to 
retain the employees that you need at the FAA?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, on the first point, Senator Moran, I want 
to thank the Committee and want to thank Congress for the 
support and the funding that you have given us because it has 
helped us keep pace.
    Now recognize, and this is one of the points that I've made 
to industry, as well, we are all pulling from the same talent 
pool ourselves, the OEMs, airlines, et cetera, but you've given 
us some of the authorities we have, like direct hire authority, 
our ability to go to universities, our ability to go to the 
industry itself.
    So we are attracting the talent. We've got a work force, no 
doubt. So we are looking to see is there anything else we are 
missing in terms of our ability. It requires an effort on our 
part. So it's one we'll continue to stare into it.
    To the extent that we need additional resources, we'll 
certainly come back to you, but I am encouraged by the progress 
to date and it certainly is one of my top priorities and one of 
our top priorities for the agency to ensure that we've just got 
that requisite talent that helps us manage our way not only 
today but well into the future.
    Senator Moran. I know from my own experience in Kansas 
hiring and maintaining, retaining employees is a huge component 
of today's economy.
    Let me see if I can get in the 18 seconds my final 
question. An integral part of the FAA is to propel innovation. 
We are supporters and advocates for advanced air mobility. 
While you have spoken recently about your excitement around AAM 
technology, the FAA has not always issued clear-cut guidance 
when moving forward in my view. That has hindered the Nation's 
ability to be competitive in this realm.
    Will the FAA hold firm on the path it defined for 
certifying these new electric aircraft?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir. You have my promise and the promise of 
the agency that we will hold firm. We have a defined pathway to 
get there. It's one we've communicated to the industry. We've 
gotten their feedback that says they feel like that's the right 
path that we're on.
    So I believe we're in a good space with respect to new 
entrants. It's one that we'll just continue to work.
    Senator Moran. I appreciate that answer because I think 
there's nervousness that the changes may occur on something 
that's already been understood and agreed to.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir.
    Senator Moran. Thank you for your confirmation that that's 
not the case.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, sir.
    Senator Moran. Thank you.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Senator Moran, I'd be happy to--I do think, Acting Director 
Nolen, that with an appropriator here, we want to make very 
clear that getting this law fully implemented does require the 
commensurate appropriation levels and so we should just for the 
record make sure that we're clear about what that would take 
and so we can get that in writing from you.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Cantwell. OK. Senator Blackburn.

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE

    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and thank you 
for this hearing today.
    Mr. Nolen, I want to really follow along on what Senator 
Cruz mentioned about our concerns with Mr. Washington, his lack 
of experience, the way he has prioritized DEI policies, whether 
it was at L.A. Metro or at the Denver Airport, and some of the 
allegations that have been made there.
    People want to know that they're going to be safe on our 
planes and we had a near-miss, a Jet Blue flight from Nashville 
to Boston. There again, an issue with Boston and a plane that 
was taking off that was not under the command of the air 
traffic control tower and nearly hit this plane that was 
landing in Boston. So we are very concerned about that.
    A couple of questions I do want to go to you on. First, 
let's talk about experienced pilots. I've joined Senator Graham 
in raising that mandatory commercial pilot retirement age from 
65 to 67. This is because of the number of flights that are 
being canceled.
    I know American Airlines has canceled nearly 50,000 flights 
that were on their docket for the summer and they're doing it 
because of the lack of pilots, and I've noted that Canada and 
Japan have raised their age to let older pilots fly.
    So my question to you is do you support this, letting 
pilots fly until the age of 67 and allowing those younger 
pilots to gain that necessary experience and these pilots that 
say we'll take a medical exam, allowing them, if they pass that 
medical exam, to continue flying. So where are you on that 
issue?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you, Senator, for the question.
    Let me just say on the first point I do believe that Phil 
Washington is fully qualified. I support the President and I 
support the nomination and we as an agency will be prepared to 
work and support and work together quite well.
    On the issue of age, it's one that is strictly set by the 
Congress. We will execute any law or any statute that you set 
before us. So I don't have a personal opinion on whether 
raising the age to 67 or above is appropriate for me. That's 
the purview of Congress to set that.
    Senator Blackburn. OK. Let's talk a little bit about C-Band 
and 5G signals because there is--I know the wireless industry 
and the FAA have been working to meet the deadlines on this and 
the first deadline is July 2023 and a final deadline of 2024 
and the aircraft that do not meet the timelines will be limited 
in their ability to operate in the U.S.
    Senator Lujan and I sent you and Secretary Buttigieg a 
letter today about this because we're concerned by recent 
reports that the airlines might not be able to meet that 
upcoming July deadline due to, and I'm quoting the 
International Air Transport Association here and their quote 
was, ``supply chain issues, certification delays, and 
unavoidable logistical challenges.''
    So we've seen wireless carriers delay their 5G deployments 
to work with the FAA on these interference issues. So what is 
your plan on ensuring that the airlines are going to be 
prepared to meet the deadlines so that the 5G roll-outs are not 
further delayed?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you, Senator, for the question.
    Let me just say that we have done--we have taken every step 
to be very communicative. What we've said is that we believe 
that 5G in commercial aviation can safely co-exist. We have 
some voluntary mitigations that were put in place by the 
telecos, but we also have another 19 who are coming in to the 
system itself.
    Our goal is to ensure that airlines can operate safely. 
We've identified a risk in the NAS, one that must be addressed. 
We believe we've given the right amount of time to do that and 
so we have no plans at this point to change the timing on that, 
and we've communicated that very much to the industry itself.
    Senator Blackburn. OK. Thank you very much. Thank you, 
Madam Chairman.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Senator Rosen.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JACKY ROSEN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Rosen. Well, thank you, Chair Cantwell, and, of 
course, Ranking Member Cruz, for holding this very important 
hearing here today.
    And so, Mr. Nolen, I want to just dive right into the FAA's 
certification work force, if you will, because the 2015 audit 
by the Department of Transportation's Inspector General found 
that the FAA lacked a comprehensive process for determining 
aircraft certification staffing needs, and in 2019, in the wake 
of the 737 MAX 8 crashes, the Joint Authority's Technical 
Review recommended that the FAA conduct a workforce review of 
its Boeing Aviation Safety Oversight Office.
    Finally, in 2021 a Department of Transportation Inspector 
General report highlighted the FAA's need to recruit, to hire, 
and to retain its skilled workforce with the technical 
expertise and abilities required to ensure safety in a rapidly 
evolving aerospace system.
    And so to address this, the Aircraft Certification, Safety, 
and Accountability Act does direct the FAA to review its 
certification workforce to determine whether the agency has the 
expertise and capability to both assess the safety implications 
of new technologies and procedures that are used by aircraft 
designers and their manufacturers and also oversee the adoption 
of these, and so I know that the FAA publishes aviation safety 
workforce plans after 2020 through 2029 and you're taking the 
issue very seriously.
    But in your personal assessment, does the FAA today have 
the workforce it needs for effective aircraft safety oversight 
and how are you going to plan to address the evolving needs 
going forward? What can we here in Congress do to help with 
this critical workforce?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, Senator Rosen, thank you very much for the 
question. We do appreciate the support of Congress in this 
critical area.
    We are--it's one we take quite seriously. If I can just 
speak first to the BASOO and our Certificate Management Office 
on Boeing particularly, we now have those offices at 107, up 
from 82 just a couple of years ago. So we've done a lot of work 
ensuring that they're adequately staffed.
    We've also augmented Boeing in particular with another 35 
FTEs from other parts of our Certification Team. We are working 
to the point on ensuring that going forward that we do have 
those requisite skill sets among our inspectors. We have a 
robust Workforce Planning and Training Division. Our report 
will be made public here in the not-too-distant future, within 
a matter of weeks, but it's one we'll continue to work at 
because the industry continues to evolve and we want to make 
sure that we're keeping pace with it. So it is a top priority 
for us.
    We're working with outside consultants on it, as well, but 
we'd love to work with you on that to make sure that there's 
nothing that we've missed in that regard.
    Senator Rosen. Yes. I think we probably need to update it 
and keep it rolling as technologies keep improving.
    But I want to continue on this workforce training issue 
because the 2020 GAO study found the FAA only infrequently 
examined gaps in critical competencies among its safety 
inspectors and engineers. It also found that the FAA did not 
routinely assess its training curriculum for these safety 
inspectors and engineers, and the GAO did recommend the FAA 
assess the workforce competency gaps and safety curriculum.
    So have you implemented the GAO's recommendation and, if 
so, how have they impacted your workforce and skills needs and 
if they haven't been fully implemented, can you give us a 
timeline of what you're planning to do there and maybe what 
assistance you might need?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thanks again for the question.
    We are working on multiple fronts to address the 
requirements. Again, as I said, we are working within AVS, 
within both our Flight Standards and Certification, to make 
sure that the training has kept pace and we are also 
identifying the gaps but we have not completed that work yet. 
We do expect it to be done by the end of this year, if not 
sooner, but it is one that we're going to make sure that we've 
kept pace and again we'd love to work with you more on that.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. Will that include building a 
curriculum covering current and new aircraft technology, human 
factors, project management, these kinds of resources for 
continuing education and training that our inspectors and 
engineers and other employees need? Will that be part of the 
plan we can look forward to?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am, it will.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. And I just want to--well, I have 
20 seconds left. So I'll ask this for the record.
    I want to ask how the FAA is tracking and measuring 
progress toward streamlining aircraft certification and flight 
standard functions, but with the few seconds left I know there 
are folks behind me, I will submit those for the record.
    Thank you for your answers.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, ma'am.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Senator Rosen.
    Senator Budd, are you ready?
    Senator Budd. Yes, Chair, thank you.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you. Senator Budd.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED BUDD, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA

    Senator Budd. So again welcome back, good to see you again.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, Chair.
    Senator Budd. The most important job at the FAA is to 
ensure aviation safety. The Aircraft Certification, Safety, and 
Accountability Act and this hearing are squarely focused on the 
FAA's aircraft certification process.
    It's unfortunate that the nominee Phil Washington could not 
answer my questions about the FAA certification process. I was 
shocked that the candidate to lead the FAA didn't know the 
FAA's three aircraft certification requirements.
    Mr. Nolen, as you know, one motivating factor behind the 
Certification Reform Bill was that the FAA's employees had 
insufficient knowledge of the 737 MAX's complex MCAS or 
Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System which led to 
tragic crashes. In both instances pilots were unable to 
overpower the MCASs or erroneous control inputs.
    A DOT Special Committee that evaluated this incident 
recommended the FAA re-evaluate its workforce strategy for 
aircraft certification to better adapt to industry changes.
    The bill, which is the subject of today's hearing, 
authorized $75 million over 3 years for the FAA to recruit and 
retain qualified engineers, safety inspectors, and software 
technical experts.
    The point was to increase FAA's ability to understand 
evermore complex technical innovations during the certification 
process.
    So, Mr. Nolen, what is the status of the FAA's recruitment 
efforts, if you would, please?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you, Senator Budd, for the question.
    Let me just say if you walk the halls of the FAA, you'll 
see that there have been 18 administrators and four actors or a 
total of 22 and they've all brought various degrees of 
expertise.
    Again, I'll just say I fully support Phil Washington. He 
will step in and he will be a very effective executive and the 
agency will absolutely support him in every regard.
    We've done a lot of work in the area of how we continue to 
train and how we continue. We are working to complete a 
comprehensive re-review of our Senior Technical Experts 
Program. We are also working on our chief scientists and 
technical advisors. We brought more onboard. We've got 14 
senior scientists, chief scientists and technical advisors. 
We've got another four technical experts that we have on staff.
    So we continue to look into this area, but at the same time 
we want to make sure we're just not solving for yesterday. We 
recognize that as technology evolves and especially with all 
the new novel entrants coming into the market that we need 
those requisite skill sets, as well.
    So that's a piece of work we've done. We're very 
appreciative of the funds we received. It has helped us get to 
where we need to be. We are on step with our hiring this year 
and we expect to continue in that regard.
    Senator Budd. Thank you for that. Now back in December 2020 
this committee released a report finding that FAA inspectors 
tasked with reviewing operational training requirements for the 
737 MAX were insufficiently qualified. The Aircraft 
Certification Bill requires airline pilots to be more involved 
at the design stage for new and refreshed aircraft models.
    So how does the FAA increase pilot participation in 
operational evaluations for aircraft that are awaiting 
certification?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, we've done a couple of things in that 
regard. So with respect to the MAX, we use pilots from around 
the world. We wanted to make sure that we didn't have just test 
pilots but we used active line pilots with varying degrees of 
skill and expertise, if you will, to ensure that, Number 1, we 
got the assumptions right.
    We're also using test pilots as we look to those that are 
in certification now, the MAX 7, the MAX 10, as well as the 
777-9. So we will continue to do that and at the same time 
we're working to make sure that our own test pilots have the 
requisite skills that they need, you know, as we get into more 
complex technology, if you will.
    Senator Budd. Thank you. One more question with the time I 
have remaining.
    The bill discussed today directed the FAA to issue many new 
regulations and reports. If we go back to the 2018, the 2016, 
and the 2012 reauthorizations, they had numerous requirements 
for new regulations and reports, a significant number which 
have not been completed.
    In the case of the 2012 reauthorization, industry has been 
waiting for nearly 11 years for some new regs to come out of 
that. So what's causing these delays, particularly with these 
new regs?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you for the question, Senator Budd.
    If you look at--there's a piece. There's a cause. You know, 
certainly we have to work through the Administrative Procedures 
Act. It is a very--I don't want to use the word ``laborious,'' 
but I'll say you just got to work through that and part of it 
is by design to make sure we just aren't flippantly sort of 
putting the regulation out there.
    So we are methodical, required to do cost-benefit analysis. 
We're required to put it out. We first start with a Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking. We put that out for comments. We 
adjudicate the comments. We work back through different parts 
of government from the agency to the department to OIRA to OMB 
and that's the process we go through to be able to turn it into 
a final rule.
    We certainly are across the agency and the department, we 
continue to look for ways that we can streamline our own 
internal processes to make sure that we're a faster speed to 
market, but it is indeed a deliberative process but certainly 
we are giving it all the attention and priority that it 
deserves.
    Senator Budd. Thank you, and again thank you for being 
here.
    Chair, I yield back. Thank you.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Senator Thune.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA

    Senator Thune. Thank you, Madam Chair, for holding this 
important hearing today and to examine FAA's implementation of 
the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act.
    I hope that today's hearing will provide a thorough 
understanding of FAA's progress in implementing this important 
legislation as well as any opportunities to build on that 
progress in the upcoming FAA reauthorization.
    The centralization of the Organization Designation 
Authorization Office created by the FAA Reauthorization Act of 
2018 and improved under the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and 
Accountability Act was crucial to improving the consistency of 
manufacturer oversight nationwide.
    Unfortunately, the FAA's nearly 2 years behind schedule in 
forming an expert review panel to examine ODA holders and 
provide recommendations required by the certification bill.
    A separate ODA expert review panel was also convened in 
2021 pursuant to a requirement from the 2018 FAA 
Reauthorization.
    So, Mr. Nolen, could you describe for us how the FAA will 
ensure the new panel's work is complementary to the 
recommendations of the previous expert panel, and from your 
perspective, how can the agency improve the strong oversight of 
ODA holders while ensuring benefits of the program remain 
intact?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you, Senator Thune, for the 
question.
    We've done a lot of work in the ODA area. Number 1, we were 
working last year to get that office up and staffed. I can 
remember that certainly our teams came and gave your staff 
where we were at in the teens and the 20s on the numbers. We 
are now full. We have a full complement of 50 personnel in that 
office to address across the competencies.
    We have taken the work of the 103 expert review panels. So 
that's another part of the work. That team, that group of 
industry experts along with the agency met just on the first 
and second of this month. So we're taking the lead on that. 
They've got 270 days to deliver their report and we continue to 
work on everything around the ODA to make sure we've 
communicated policy out there. We have non-interference with 
unit members.
    We also are working to ensure that that level of oversight 
by our unit members but also by our leaders in the field, 
principally at Boeing but elsewhere, as well, that it is there 
and they sense that it's working well.
    Now I will tell you I have done visits to Seattle. I've 
done visits to South Carolina. I've visited Airbus. I've 
visited Embry Air. And so that's part of my first and foremost 
answer that I ask our team. How are you doing? Are you seeing 
any interference and are you getting the right amount of 
transparency that you need from the OEM? Overwhelmingly, the 
answer to that has been yes. It doesn't mean we're claiming 
victory, but we certainly have made a lot of progress in this 
regard.
    Senator Thune. Good. As I mentioned at the hearing last 
week, on February 8, Senator Warner and I introduced the 
Increasing Competitiveness for American Drones Act which 
directs FAA to establish a regulatory framework for beyond 
visual line of sight UAS operations.
    I believe that a clear framework for such operations is 
critical to the safety and efficiency of the NAS, and I intend 
to work with the Chair and Ranking Member to integrate this 
legislation into any FAA reauthorization bill.
    So could you describe the FAA's current work to create a 
beyond visual line of sight regulatory framework and otherwise 
streamline the airworthiness approval process for UAS?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question.
    As you are aware, we stood up the Beyond the VLS, Beyond 
Visual Line of Sight ARC, Aviation Rulemaking Committee. We put 
that out for public comments and we got quite a few comments 
in. We are in the process of adjudicating those and then we'll 
work to get that into NPRM. It is absolutely one of our highest 
priorities.
    We've also stood up an integrated team within the FAA. We 
have what we're calling I Teams. So we're looking at UAS. We're 
looking at EV Talls. We're looking at what will be required to 
operate in the NAS.
    So we've got very much of an integrated approach to this to 
ensure--our top priority is to ensure that we can enable this 
technology and do it as timely as we can, consistent with 
ensuring that we've met our safety mission.
    Senator Thune. So in drafting the bill, Senator Warner and 
I worked to address the concerns of incumbent users of the NAS, 
especially those operating at lower altitudes, and by that I'm 
referring to helicopters and agricultural aviation.
    That said, more work will need to be done at the agency to 
ensure the safe co-existence of UAS with these stakeholders.
    So how will the FAA work to ensure the safe co-existence of 
nascent beyond visual line of sight operations with some of 
those incumbent users at lower altitudes?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, that's exactly the body of work that we're 
taking on, sir, with our group. One of the projects they've got 
is called NNA-28 and we are working with NASA, we are working 
with Mitre. We are working internally with the department, as 
well, to ensure that we've very much got a coordinated 
integrated approach to this to ensure that we can accommodate 
all uses of the NAS.
    Senator Thune. And are you incorporating the concerns of 
these stakeholders to make sure that they're addressed?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir, we are.
    Senator Thune. OK. Good. My time's expired. Thank you, 
Madam Chair.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    I would just point out that that ODA expert review panel, 
besides, you know, representatives from machinists, I think 
it's good news that Javier de Luis is on there. He is an MIT 
aerospace engineer, unfortunately lost his sister on the 
Ethiopian crash. So we're very glad that his voice in 
representing families will be there.
    Senator Klobuchar, are you----
    Senator Klobuchar. Yes.
    Senator Cantwell.--ready? OK, OK. Senator Klobuchar.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Nolen. Good to 
see you again.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thanks again for talking to Senator 
Moran and I in our roles as head of the Travel and Tourism 
Caucus.
    As you know, Senator Moran and Capito and I worked together 
to introduce the bipartisan NOTAM Improvement Act. We've talked 
about this, I think, to create an FAA task force to recommend 
improvements to prevent future outages in light of what 
happened a month or so ago. The House version of it has passed 
actually, led by Representative Stauber, and the task force 
would be composed of representatives from air carriers, 
airports, airline pilots, aircraft dispatchers, FAA personnel, 
unions, as well as aviation safety cybersecurity experts.
    Do you agree that in order to effectively modernize our 
system, we need to have all parties involved at the table?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am, I absolutely agree.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Very good. And we're hoping we can 
get this done quickly, given that it's already passed the 
House.
    I also want to talk about the Safe Skies Act. I think 
safety isn't just about the quality of the planes. It also 
depends on our aviation work force. A tired pilot is a danger 
to themselves, others in the air, and those on the ground.
    I introduced the Safe Skies Act to take the rest 
requirements put in place for passenger pilots and apply them 
to cargo pilots who currently have looser rest requirements.
    Do you agree that cargo pilots should operate under the 
same fatigue rules as commercial airline pilots?
    Mr. Nolen. What I would say, Senator Klobuchar, is that 
these are managed vis a vis part of the safety management 
system. Every airline is required to have a fatigue management 
system, and we've looked at that in-depth and so far everything 
that we see have pointed to no additional risk on the part of 
cargo operations, but it's one we also remain open if there are 
additional findings that are an area for improvement.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Well, I hope you'll look at this 
bill.
    Rural airports, we have 256 smaller airports across the 
country that's helped by the Contract Tower Program and it 
works very well in Minnesota.
    Do you commit to ensuring that rural airports have the 
updated air traffic control towers and facilities they need to 
accommodate the rising air traffic levels that they're 
experiencing?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am. We will commit to continue to work 
with you on this. Our goal is to ensure that we've got that 
level of service across the NAS, that is, serves every one of 
the constituents of the NAS. So we will certainly look forward 
to working with you more on that.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Very good. Following the two tragic 
airplane crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that took 346 lives, 
including a man from St. Cloud, Minnesota, we worked to pass 
with the Chairman's great leadership the Aircraft Safety and 
Certification Reform Act of 2020.
    I know you already talked to my colleagues Budd and Rosen 
about FAA and how they're training existing staff. Could you 
talk about recruiting staff and what you're doing?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am. We're taking that same sort of 
approach. We've sat down as an executive team and certainly 
within our Aviation Safety Services and said what are the skill 
sets we need not only for today but for tomorrow, especially as 
we see novel entrants come into the marketplace. So we want to 
make sure we got the skill sets.
    One of the challenges I mentioned is that we are all 
pulling from the same talent pool, but we are using every 
effort at our disposal. We're reaching out to universities, 
industry itself to ensure that we get the right talent for the 
agency.
    Senator Klobuchar. All right. Thank you very much. I'll put 
the rest of my questions in writing, but I really appreciate 
you being here today.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, ma'am.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
    I know we have a couple of members who are on their way and 
we also have votes going on. So hopefully we'll get these 
members in here and questions answered but if anybody else----
    Senator Klobuchar. I actually have one more.
    Senator Cantwell. All right. Well, go right ahead.
    Senator Klobuchar. Madam Chair, I was trying to be nice to 
my fellow members.
    Senator Cantwell. I have follow up, too, but go ahead.
    Senator Klobuchar. I'll do one.
    Senator Cantwell. Yes, go ahead, go right ahead, Senator 
Klobuchar.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Automated flight control feature of 
the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft intended to assist the flight crew 
has been identified as playing a significant role in those two 
fatal crashes I mentioned before. Investigations found that the 
flight crews were not trained on how to override or disable the 
system.
    With pilots often relying on automation during flights, do 
you believe that pilots are adequately trained to recognize and 
react to unexpected events under the current training 
requirements by the FAA?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you, Senator Klobuchar, for the 
question.
    Let me say from a point of personal experience as a long-
time pilot and a captain I always felt that I was well trained 
but we want to make sure that exists everywhere.
    Our mission, my mission as the chief safety officer for the 
FAA is we believe that everyone is entitled to a level of 
safety no matter where in the world they fly and so that's part 
of my mantra. The training is here but we continue to look for 
how do we improve that.
    This is another critical aspect for safety management 
systems. You have the ability to identify. There's lots of data 
that the airlines have in terms of their training and we're 
working also with our international partners, with civil 
aviation authorities. We've published last year the Advisory 
Circular on Flight Path Management, part of which gets into 
automated system, ensuring that we don't get into state of 
over-reliance on automation, over-reliance on technology, and 
that our pilots continue to maintain and hone their manual 
flying skills. So it's one that's top of mind for us.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Thanks.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, ma'am.
    Senator Cantwell. Senator Welch.

                STATEMENT OF HON. PETER WELCH, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM VERMONT

    Senator Welch. Thank you very much.
    Welcome, Mr. Nolen. I wanted to focus on the staffing 
requirements that are necessary to make certain that there is 
careful and timely review of electronic aircraft and so I 
wanted to ask you a few questions about that. That's emerging 
technology.
    Vermont has a company that's very much involved in that, 
and the questions I have have to do with whether the FAA 
currently has an adequate number of subject matter experts on 
new and emerging technologies, including the advanced air 
mobility and electric aircraft, to be able to support the 
certification process.
    Mr. Nolen. It is one that we believe our staffing is 
adequate for the moment but it's one that we have to stay on 
top of. As I mentioned just before you walked in, sir, is that 
we have stood up an integrated project team to look at the 
entire ecosystem around advanced air mobility. We're calling 
them I Team members.
    So we have certification. We have cert engineers. We have 
flight standards inspectors. We have air traffic inspectors. We 
have human factors. So we're looking across the totality of 
what it will take to enable new entrants into the NAS and to 
ensure that our national air space can accommodate them all.
    Senator Welch. You know, we've got this company in Vermont 
that's really working hard and they're apprehensive about this 
and what you just said is a little bit in conflict with what 
they're hearing.
    Do you have an estimate of the number of subject matter 
experts on new and emerging technologies that the FAA has right 
now?
    Mr. Nolen. I don't have a number right off the top of my 
head, but I'd be more than happy to follow up with staff on 
that, sir.
    Senator Welch. Well, you know, it'd be good to do that 
because this has got to be specific and concrete. By the way, 
staffing issues are rampant everywhere. So I'm sure that's a 
real challenge.
    Mr. Nolen. If I may, sir, with your permission, I would say 
for every company that's out there, we have a very structured 
process. We stood up in 2018 the Center for Emerging Concepts 
and Innovation expressly to be able to take new entrants and 
we're doing it early in the process. They come to us. They tell 
us what they have, how they operate, the complexity of it, and 
we can decide where we need to plug them in. Those offices are 
adequately manned and we've up-gauged this at the leadership 
level, as well, to make sure we've got that level of oversight.
    Senator Welch. OK. I'd like to just be able to be in 
regular communication with you if I'm hearing that there are 
problems on the ground because----
    Mr. Nolen. You have my commitment.
    Senator Welch.--the quick turnaround, timely turnaround is 
really going to be important, as you know.
    As the FAA continues to implement provisions to the 
Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act, it's 
obviously important that the agency meets the implementation 
timeline requirements that are included in the law.
    It has been over 270 days since that bill was passed in 
December 2020, and as the Committee continues its work on FAA 
reauthorizations, it'd be helpful if you could let us know 
whether the agency needs more resources to meet workforce 
challenges, and when do you expect the FAA review will be 
completed?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, on the review itself, we do expect that to 
be completed by the end of this year. So we are working hard. 
We recognized when we got into it, sir, that we just need to 
make sure we get it right and make sure that we have the 
capacity and the capabilities and the talent to be able to 
stare into the future.
    Senator Welch. Any idea when that will be done?
    Mr. Nolen. It will be done by the end of this year. Yes, 
sir.
    Senator Welch. End of Calendar Year 2023?
    Mr. Nolen. Exactly. Yes, sir.
    Senator Welch. And as the FAA does complete that required 
review, I just want some reassurance of your commitment to 
reviewing FAA's current staff capacity in the electric aviation 
space.
    Mr. Nolen. You have my commitment, sir.
    Senator Welch. Thank you very much.
    I'm going to yield to Mr. Vance. Thank you.

                STATEMENT OF HON. J. D. VANCE, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO

    Senator Vance. Thank you, Senator Welch, and, Mr. Nolen, 
good to see you again. Welcome back.
    I just wanted to ask a couple of questions about the 737 
MAX and some of the safety remediation that's been done, maybe 
what the agency has learned in response to it.
    So just to recap here, you know, my understanding, and 
please correct this if this is wrong, my understanding is, of 
course, you have 737 MAX, which was developed on the existing 
Boeing 737 platform. They developed a couple of larger aircraft 
engines and the basic idea was that the aircraft engines, while 
it would make the plane more efficient and maybe a better 
modern plane, that one of the issues is that it might actually 
increase the angle of attack such that you would increase the 
risk of stalling and so they installed various hardware and 
software devices to sort of, you know, level off the plane if 
it reached a risk of stalling.
    Unfortunately, the manual override on some of those 
automatic stabilizers that would prevent the plane from 
climbing too quickly failed to be properly overridden or maybe 
the pilots didn't have proper training for the new avionics and 
so you had a couple of pretty catastrophic incidents and, of 
course, we're all worried about that. I know you are and 
certainly I am, too, and we want to make sure that doesn't 
happen here in the United States.
    I guess just sort of a threshold question. Is that 
basically right? Is that sort of a summation of where we are 
with the 737 MAX, is that correct?
    Mr. Nolen. I think you've captured it well, Senator 
Vance,----
    Senator Vance. OK.
    Mr. Nolen.--yes.
    Senator Vance. So maybe explain to me. My understanding is 
that as of about 2020 with some additional pilot training 
requirements you guys effectively reauthorized the 737 MAX for 
flight in the United States in 2020, is that correct?
    Mr. Nolen. That's correct.
    Senator Vance. OK. So one worry that I have, and we've had 
a couple of incidents that have come to our attention in our 
office that I just wanted to highlight here, if we could--so 
I'll just point your attention here, and if you can't read it, 
I'm happy to read it.
    So the first is an American Airlines flight January 20th 
coming from Miami. This is a very new Boeing 737 MAX, and the 
flight is American 2692 PAN PAN PAN. ``Due to a control failure 
with our stabilizer trim, we'd like to remain at 7,000 while we 
work some issues.''
    Do you know what PAN is?
    Mr. Nolen. I do. Yes, sir.
    Senator Vance. OK. So it's a non-emergent sort of call for 
help?
    Mr. Nolen. That's correct.
    Senator Vance. OK. So that was an American flight on 
January 20 and that's just a couple of months ago.
    This February 24 flight, 2023, Phoenix, Arizona. I may be 
especially worried about this because my family has flown on a 
737 at Southwest out of Phoenix, Arizona, before, but Southwest 
9017, ``We need to turn back toward Phoenix and we're going to 
declare an emergency. We just declared just because it's a 
brand-new airplane and the autopilot is not--the trim system is 
not working on the aircraft. It's not trimming at all. So we're 
having to do manual trimming.''
    When I look at that with relatively new aircraft, I guess 
my automatic reaction is is the 737 MAX actually safe. Have we 
done the necessary work here? Does your agency--do you feel 
confident that we're actually in a position here where we can 
say the 737 MAX is doing what it needs to do in light of the 
fact that we have some pretty recent safety complaints here?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir, I can. I can say categorically that 
the 737 MAX air product is safe.
    Senator Vance. OK. So maybe try to square the circle for me 
a little bit here because, you know, you say that it's safe and 
I certainly would like to believe you and I certainly know the 
agency has done a lot of work to ensure its safety.
    Why are we still having pilots express some concerns about 
very new off-the-line 737 MAXs if the FAA thinks that these 
things have been brought up to speed?
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you for the question, Senator Vance.
    What I would say without knowing the specifics of this 
particular flight or in the aftermath what may have been the 
finding from aircraft maintenance at these two carriers, I'd 
want to know more about each individual case.
    Without getting too technical, within a quick reference 
guide you have different sort of indications, different things 
that might happen in flight and with crews that are trained and 
prepared to deal with as they did in both of these cases.
    I would not want to speak out in turn without knowing more 
about these two individual cases. What I can tell you is that 
we're working very closely as we go through the certification 
of the MAX 7 and the MAX 10 and we are using active pilots with 
different, you know, degrees of experience, if you will, to 
make sure that our assumptions are correct about any new and 
novel system, recognizing that there are things on an airplane 
that have always been there, like stabilizer trim, like other 
things.
    Senator Vance. Sure.
    Mr. Nolen. Provisions for something, if you get a 
malfunction of that sort.
    Senator Vance. Sure. So let me just make a couple quick 
final comments because I know I'm out of time here.
    One just a request, Mr. Nolen, and I'd love for you to 
maybe sort of look into this in some detail and try to 
understand a little bit. You know, I understand planes have 
problems, you know. Most of the time, thank God, they're not 
catastrophic, but I'd like to have maybe a little bit more 
reassurance that we're not doing something with the 737 MAX 
that we don't see elevated rates of pilot-initiated, you know, 
concerns or pilot-initiated emergencies, the sort of things 
that cause a plane to fly back home or, God forbid, something 
worse down the road.
    The second thing I want to say is just an observation here, 
Mr. Nolen. So, you know, you obviously know your stuff and I 
appreciate that and I appreciate your forthrightness in 
responding to these questions.
    I will note that we have a nominee in front of us to 
replace you as the FAA Administrator and that person has shown 
not nearly the level of faculty with basic airline and aviation 
knowledge and I think that should raise some concerns, 
especially given how important this industry is to public 
safety.
    So with that, thank you for your time, Mr. Nolen, 
appreciate it.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Senator Schmitt.

                STATEMENT OF HON. ERIC SCHMITT, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI

    Senator Schmitt. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
    Good to see you again.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, sir.
    Senator Schmitt. I wanted to follow up. I know you've been 
asked this and I've heard bits and pieces of it, but what I 
wanted to focus on is the whistleblower----
    Mr. Nolen. Yes.
    Senator Schmitt.--protections included in the new ACSAA. 
The previous Chairman of the Committee, I know, Senator Wicker 
was very focused on this and there was a report that came out 
that essentially said that there was a retaliatory sort of 
regime in place, that whistleblowers really weren't welcome, 
which is, I think, the impetus for part of the legislation that 
we're seeing now as it relates to whistleblowers.
    But in my review of this, the so-called whistleblower 
protections, the only thing that I can really glean from this 
is, you know, it's sort of window dressing or trying to paint a 
broken down El Camino and call it a Cadillac because it looks 
like there are just some renaming of offices and an ombudsman 
that has been indicated here.
    This is a sincere question to you, which is, you worked in, 
you know, three different airlines, worked for three different 
airlines. You have a track record with, you know, ensuring 
safety. That has been one of your roles, I think, at the last 
airline you worked for. You were in a senior position on that.
    If you were king of the world here, what would you like to 
see in this legislation that goes further than what's in here 
right now to ensure that whistleblowers were protected because 
obviously culture's very important in any organization and 
particularly with the FAA, I mean, safety is the highest 
priority.
    I can't think of another industry, regulated industry like 
that that, you know, people are very concerned about that. So 
you certainly want a culture where people feel like they can 
come forward.
    Mr. Nolen. Absolutely.
    Senator Schmitt. Where would you go with this?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, Senator Schmitt, thank you so much for the 
question.
    I would say two quick things. Number 1, with respect to our 
program within the FAA, the Director of Audits and 
Investigation reports directly to me or into the Office of the 
Administrator. I meet with the person on a regular basis. I 
have not seen in my time there for this past year that I've 
been in the role an account where I've said that gives me pause 
and we've gone through every one of those.
    For the ones that we've seen in the past, what I want to 
see, what I would like to see is that we've got strong robust 
safety management systems in place at every airline and at the 
OEMs and all of the other operators that we require. I also 
want to see that there's a level of transparency and that when 
our inspectors in the field or manager or whomever highlights 
an event that we run it to ground and that we ensure that 
there's absolutely no pressure.
    I can assure you on my watch we have not tolerated any 
pressure on behalf of our employees or inspectors in the field 
that we have not addressed.
    Senator Schmitt. Well, I think that's important because 
obviously coming from the top creating that culture where 
people feel like they can come forward and they're not going to 
be, as it was quoted, ``The FAA continues to retaliate against 
whistleblowers instead of welcoming their disclosures in the 
interest of safety,'' that's a pretty damning statement.
    So it comes from the top in establishing culture, but I 
would like--I don't need to hear this today, but would welcome 
any additions to the ACSAA that would allow for additional 
protections for whistleblowers because, like I said, I think 
this is of paramount concern.
    Mr. Nolen. We appreciate the offer and we'll be more than 
happy to follow up.
    Senator Schmitt. And let me also say and add to the chorus 
of what we heard, I think the nominee that was before this 
committee, I guess that was just last week, in my view is 
wholly unqualified and I think you have demonstrated, you know, 
the Q&A that we've had now for a couple weeks certainly a 
greater mastery and I was pleased to hear your comments on 
establishing culture and welcoming people coming forward, 
whistleblowers.
    So again I think that the current nominee, not you, the 
current nominee for the highest spot here, the Biden 
Administration would be wise, I think, to pull that back.
    Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Mr. Nolen, I think we have one more colleague on their way, 
but in the meantime I wanted to ask you about service 
difficulty reports.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Cantwell. You know, the underlying safety 
legislation said we want better trend lines. We want a trend 
report every year on what are the emerging trends to be 
concerned about and your safety service difficulty reports are 
already a system in place, but what do you see any concerning 
trend lines, particularly about the MAX or any other planes in 
the marketplace today?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you, Senator Cantwell, Chair 
Cantwell, for the question.
    You know, I look at it. I do have access to all the service 
difficulty reports. I'm not seeing personally any trend that 
sort of gives me pause or sort of raises any red flags.
    What I do expect and what will be to all of our benefit is 
as we see SMSs mature net level of transparency. If I can just 
speak briefly on my own history, you know, many times when I 
was flying and I'd make a write-up, it goes into the logbook, 
goes to maintenance, they run it through their process.
    The difference we see today is that as the maturity of SMSs 
has ticked up, we're starting to see better trending. We have 
the level of oversight. For example, if you're at an airline, 
you've got a principal maintenance inspector. You've got a 
principal avionics inspector. These are our leaders in the 
field who are working in many cases on a daily basis but 
certainly on a weekly basis with the airlines that they oversee 
about everything that's happening with their maintenance 
programs. So it is a part of it.
    Senator Cantwell. How can the public get access to, if not 
the actual reports, some analysis of this is what we got this 
week or these are the issues?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am. Some of those may have proprietary 
information, but some we've been very responsive to. Some have 
had FOIA requests. There may be times where we may have to do 
some redactions and we work on those.
    Our goal is to be as forthcoming, but I think for the 
Committee we continue to work to see how we get you the 
information you need in terms of trends that we may be seeing 
in the NAS, but just specifically to this, there's nothing in 
what I am seeing to date that says there's a trend on a MAX or 
a 7 or 8, et cetera.
    Senator Cantwell. I would like to work with you. I want 
more----
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Cantwell.--transparency here. I don't want people 
to believe that there's something out there that they don't 
have access to or information that they don't have and if you 
are reviewing that, which obviously the FAA, that's a key 
charge of the safety group that you have been running, is to 
make sure that that information is disseminated or that we 
follow whatever information is there.
    But I think some of this is either leaking out or people 
are hearing about it and there's no way to resolve this issue 
about is there something there or is there not something there, 
and I feel like we need to figure out some way to give the 
public some more transparency here.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am. I couldn't agree more. It is sort of 
like this Safety Summit that we're doing. We've got a couple 
events, but at the end of NAS, 45,000 flights a day, nearly a 
billion enplanements a year. So overall the system is 
resilient, but we never take that for granted. So there's a dot 
to be connected. We'll look to see can we connect them and if 
they're not, we'll say that.
    Senator Cantwell. Senator Sullivan.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DAN SULLIVAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Sullivan. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Mr. Nolen, welcome back.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, sir.
    Senator Sullivan. You've been a busy man in front of this 
committee.
    Let me just start with a real basic--I'm sure you covered 
it, but I'd like to hear it again from you. You know, I think 
in the last 3 months we've had six near--I don't want to call 
them collisions but certainly dangerous circumstances in our 
public aviation sector.
    Can you just right now assure the American people that 
flying aircraft in the United States of America is still the 
safest way to travel, which I believe it is, and we're still 
the safest place in the world in which to do that?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir. I would just restate what I just said 
to Chair Cantwell. On any given day, 45,000 flights in the 
U.S., 1.7 to 2.4 million passengers per day. We're at nearly a 
billion enplanements per year. We've gone 14 years without a 
fatal commercial passenger accident.
    Senator Sullivan. Knock on wood.
    Mr. Nolen. Knock on wood, knock on steel. We don't take it 
for granted, but that being said, every time we start to see 
are there trends? We don't know. So one of the reasons I've got 
an Administrator Call to Action. So we are bringing in our 
stakeholders a week from today and we will sit and talk about 
what are you seeing and then we'll give them an opportunity to 
go back to their operation and then come back to us with some 
concrete examples.
    Senator Sullivan. In the Marine Corps, we call it a safety 
stand-down.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir.
    Senator Sullivan. Is that what you're doing?
    Mr. Nolen. It's effectively a safety stand-down without a 
safety stand-down.
    Senator Sullivan. OK. Good. We need that. I think it's good 
you're doing that.
    Let me turn to another issue. My office is constantly 
fielding complaints with the processing of aircraft 
registration and clearance for air medicals for pilots and 
evidence points to bottlenecks in the FAA offices at Oklahoma 
City.
    What can be done to streamline the registry modernization 
system that certainly again all signs that we're hearing about 
point to a manpower issue and it's really frustrating for a 
number of folks in Alaska, but I'm assuming it's an issue that 
impacts everybody all over the country.
    Mr. Nolen. Well, thank you, Senator Sullivan, for the 
question.
    I have indeed talked with our AVS leadership and this is 
one that I've gotten their commitment and so you have my 
commitment that we just need to do better, especially on the 
registry piece.
    They've got a plan in place to reduce the number of days 
for the registry from a 180 to 75 by the end of April and 
continue to drive it down to the balance of the year, and I've 
also directed them to go back and again ensure that we have the 
requisite level of staffing to make sure that we can maintain 
that level of commitment that we owe the flying public and 
those who need the registered airplane.
    In the medical space,----
    Senator Sullivan. Yes.
    Mr. Nolen.--we've got a good--you know, Dr. Susan Northrup, 
who's the chief flight surgeon for the agency, has got a good 
process in place, still being worked there, working on 
technology. In the meantime, our Med Express is now set up so 
that a person going for a flight physical can know exactly 
where they're in the process. So we have made improvements to 
that system, but we are working on a longer-term improvement.
    I don't have an exact date, but I'm happy to follow up with 
you on that to have a replacement for the system. In the 
meantime, MedX has given a greater degree of transparency about 
where a person stands with respect to their medical.
    Senator Sullivan. Good. So there's a streamlining effort of 
the Office of Aerospace Medicine. Of course, we don't want to 
sacrifice the safety of the flying public, but----
    Mr. Nolen. That's correct.
    Senator Sullivan.--there has to be a balance.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, sir.
    Senator Sullivan. Is that what's happening then? Is that 
what you're saying?
    Mr. Nolen. It is happening and we'll just continue to 
improve it.
    Senator Sullivan. OK. Let me ask one final question I've 
had from a couple constituents.
    You know, we have, I think, certainly more pilots per 
capita of any state in the country. Americans are clearly 
living longer. You look at our lifespan. We have a pilot 
shortage of good pilots.
    Is there any thought to extending or looking at the issue 
of mandatory pilot for commercial--mandatory retirement for 
commercial pilots who can maybe pass a rigorous annual physical 
or, I mean, we have a lot of good pilots who are in their 60s 
and 70s and what's your--especially when they fly together on 
commercial airplanes.
    What's your thinking on that? Isn't that a way to help 
address--really get experienced pilots--address a pilot 
shortage that I know is impacting the whole country without--
again without impacting safety but it seems to me there's a 
solution there that can be smart. Have you guys been thinking 
about that?
    Mr. Nolen. Well, let me just say, sir, it is one that's 
clearly within the purview of Congress. So we would not make 
any presumptions in that area. Our goal is to execute the law 
and execute the statute.
    So I would just say that----
    Senator Sullivan. And the mandatory retirement age right 
now is?
    Mr. Nolen.--is 65.
    Senator Sullivan. Don't you think there are pilots who are 
66 who are really, really good?
    Mr. Nolen. You know, if you're asking what I personally 
think about it, I think as an agency our goal is to follow the 
law.
    Senator Sullivan. I know, I know, but you actually have a 
lot of experience. So let me get your personal opinion on this.
    Mr. Nolen. My opinion, I flew till I was--you know, I'm a 
pilot, been a pilot for 42 years. In my life as an airline 
pilot I would have had to retire at 65. I don't think I'm in a 
position to offer a personal opinion as the Acting 
Administrator on this specific question.
    Senator Sullivan. OK. Madam Chair, I think it's a good 
topic to take a look at.
    Senator Cantwell. Yes. So thank you, Senator Sullivan.
    We will be having a series of four different hearings as it 
relates to the FAA reauthorization and we will certainly 
include this as a topic. I think workforce will be a very big 
topic in general as you can see from many of our colleagues who 
asked questions today, and obviously we not only want the right 
positions authorized but we want them appropriated and we want 
a full FAA and we want the commercial sector to have the pilots 
that they need. So I predict this will be a very big part of 
the discussion.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Cantwell. Mr. Nolen, I wanted to ask for the record 
about Gray Beards. So I'm going to send something to you 
because I really want a technical answer here about what has 
been established in response to the law.
    Just to be clear, we said after the MCAS System how is it 
that the FAA--you know, we were having a lot of discussion here 
this morning about, you know, what's the right leadership at 
the FAA. I would definitely say the issue of regulatory capture 
was a very big issue in us writing the safety bill and making 
sure that people reported to the FAA and the FAA felt 
responsible.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Cantwell. So one of the issues is the fact that you 
were supposed to hire Gray Beard's sophisticated people who are 
working to understand the technology at the beginning of the 
certification process.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Cantwell. So I understand that you have done that 
but that you are doing it by segmentation, is that correct?
    Mr. Nolen. That is correct, Chair Cantwell. We've hired--
we're at 14 senior chief scientists and technical assistants. 
We're looking to hire an additional four. We have four senior 
technical advisors and this is one we just have to continue to 
stare into to make sure do we have it right not only for today 
but as we stare into tomorrow, right, as they're no novel. So 
we are committed to it and like I said, so with this 14, 
another four, we've got 18, with a plan to hire four more.
    Senator Cantwell. But these are people that you think 
represent the sophistication on the technology side of today's 
certification process?
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Cantwell. OK. And you have the funding for that? 
Give me some examples of people who we're missing before but 
now are part of the team.
    Mr. Nolen. As you look at that across these sort of 
competencies, right, we think about certification and when we 
think about the changes, as we think about the evolution of 
technology, one I know you're very passionate about, this is 
the kind of, you know, skill sets we want. As we move forward, 
you know, as yet, I've gone out and I've flown the MAX 10 
simulator. I've been to Airbus and flown the A-380. I've gone 
to Embry Air and flown their newest airplane.
    Making sure we get it right and making sure that our 
technical experts, as we go through the whole design and 
certification process, that we got the level, you know, if 
there's something someone needs to go press the test, let's 
make sure we got that right. That's the kind of expertise that 
we're looking for. So we continue to work at it.
    Senator Cantwell. Well, for us, it's making sure that in 
the beginning of the certification process or anywhere during--
--
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Cantwell.--the certification process that another 
MCAS isn't projected as part of a system that people don't 
understand it.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes.
    Senator Cantwell. That's the key.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Cantwell. And so you feel like that this group that 
you now have on the technical side is providing that level of 
technical expertise up and down?
    Mr. Nolen. I do indeed, having spent time with our folks 
not only in Seattle and there but also on the cert side sitting 
with our team.
    I will say it is our expectation now and I commend the 
Congress for this, right, as part of the Act that we're getting 
all of this information. We want to make sure that we got it 
all upfront, that we understand at the very outset of either 
design for our new type design or an amended type design that 
that information is there.
    What we're seeing vis a vis these system safety analyses 
that our team are now doing, that's again giving us a better 
degree of transparency there, and we're going through those 
very purposefully to make sure we get it right, that we don't 
have a repeat.
    Senator Cantwell. Yes. Well, we'll give you some additional 
questions for the record as relates to the details on that----
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Cantwell [continuing]. Because we really want to 
understand how it's functioning within the FAA. We just want to 
make sure that we understand how it's been set up and what 
oversight it has by each type of certificate process. We think 
it's a very important aspect of the certification.
    OK. Well, that seems to complete our hearing this morning.
    We'll remain open for 4 weeks, until April 5. Any Senators 
who'd like to submit questions for the record should do so in 
the next two weeks, by March 22, and we ask that you have your 
responses by April 5.
    Mr. Nolen. Yes, ma'am.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you so much.
    Mr. Nolen. Thank you, ma'am.
    Senator Cantwell. We're adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:39 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

                            A P P E N D I X

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to 
                              Billy Nolen
Service Difficulty Reporting System
    On October 5, 2022, the Southwest Airlines (SWA) FAA Certificate 
Management Office (CMO) sent a letter to SWA identifying a significant 
problem with the FAA's Service Difficulty Reporting (SDR) System, which 
is the primary means for the aviation community to share with the FAA 
reports of failures, malfunctions, or defects on aeronautical products. 
The objective of the Service Difficulty Program is to achieve prompt 
correction of conditions adversely affecting continued airworthiness of 
aeronautical products.
    According to this letter, the FAA's automated system for processing 
SDRs was shut down in 2008 after it was found to be ``corrupted,'' 
leading to a backlog of 38,000 SDRs, which are being uploaded with 
``limited quality verification'' in an effort to reduce the backlog.

    Question 1. What is the current status of the SDR system? What 
corrective actions are being taken by the FAA to maintain the system's 
accuracy and reliability for airlines and FAA personnel?
    Answer. The Service Difficulty Reporting System (SDRS) is fully 
functional and the backlog has been addressed. In late 2021, the FAA 
began modernizing SDRS. The new system will enable enhanced data 
collection, sharing, and analysis to improve corporate decision-making 
and prioritization. The system will incorporate the use of automation 
as a quality assurance tool, highlighting errors at point of entry and 
ensuring mandatory fields are entered prior to acceptance.

    Question 2. Does the FAA agree with the SWA CMO that the SDR system 
is ``defective'' and ``corrupted'' as stated in the letter?
    Answer. No. The Service Difficulty Reporting System (SDRS) is fully 
functional and continues to accept new reports. When information is 
missing or inaccurate, the FAA works with operators to validate the 
data.

    Question 3. Does the FAA have alternative means for obtaining 
reliable information regarding the types of airworthiness problems that 
are required to be reported by operators under the SDR system?
    Answer. Operators may submit reports through the Service Difficulty 
Report, FAA Form 8070-1, or the dedicated SDRS website at: https://
sdrs.faa.gov/. The FAA receives reports through other regulatory 
reporting requirements including Title 14 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations Sec. 21.3, Reporting of failures, malfunctions, and 
defects. The FAA also receives information on service difficulty issues 
through voluntary programs, such as the Aviation Safety Action Program 
(ASAP).
737 MAX Service Difficulty Reports
    The Committee has received information that Alaska Airlines has 
filed hundreds of SDRs relating to the 737 MAX, suggesting production 
quality issues, but other operators of these airplanes have filed 
significantly fewer.

    Question 1. Please provide data on the number of SDRs relating to 
the 737 MAX, sorted by operator. How does the FAA address 
discrepancies, if any, in the number and type of SDRs for a particular 
aircraft across operators?
    Answer. Service Difficulty Reports (SDRs) are a critical component 
of safety management for an operational fleet. The FAA reviews all SDRs 
submitted by operators
to assess any safety trends or the need for additional corrective 
action. Below is a breakdown of SDRs submitted by major U.S. airlines 
for the 737 MAX.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      Percentage of 737
                     Number of 737     737 MAX SDR     MAX  SDRs among
     Operator         MAX in Fleet    Count  since    entire 737  fleet
                                          2017           at Operator
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alaska              42               721             4%
Southwest           167              464             0.6%
United              101              241             4.5%
American            42               196             1.4%
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Question 2. What actions has the FAA taken to ensure all operators 
are complying with the requirements to file SDRs?
    Answer. The FAA conducts regular oversight of U.S. operators. As 
part of this oversight, the FAA assesses an operator's compliance to 
SDR reporting requirements. If SDRs are not being reported to meet 
regulatory requirements, the FAA will initiate compliance or 
enforcement action and require the operator to take corrective action.

    Question 3. Given the significant number and serious nature of the 
SDRs filed by Alaska Airlines, what action has the FAA taken to address 
these issues and remedy these production quality concerns for the 737 
MAX?
    Answer. Service Difficulty Reports (SDRs) are a critical component 
of safety management for an operational fleet. The FAA reviews all SDRs 
submitted by operators to assess any safety trends or the need for 
additional corrective action. SDRs often include non-safety related 
issues like malfunctioning coffeemakers or inoperative seats. The SDRs 
submitted by Alaska Airlines for the 737 MAX are consistent with these 
types of issues.
Operational Control
    14 CFR 121.533 and 537 requires airlines to be ``responsible for 
operational control'' of their operations. Section 3-2269 of FAA Order 
8900.1 clarifies that airlines must ``conduct operational control by 
making decisions and performing those actions on a daily basis that are 
necessary to operate flights safely and in compliance with applicable 
regulations.''

    Question 1. What actions has the FAA taken to investigate whether 
Southwest Airlines lost operational control during Winter Storm 
Elliott?
    Answer. In December 2022, in response to Southwest Airlines 
significant flight cancellations and associated flight crew reroutes, 
the Certificate Management Office increased surveillance of the 
airline. This included surveillance of ground operations safety, 
enroute/cabin inspections, and operational control inspections for 
safety and compliance. No loss of operational control was identified. 
Flight cancellations, reroutes, etc., while not an optimum business 
situation for the airline, are indicative of the airline exercising 
operational control.

    Question 2. What does the FAA do on a regular basis to monitor the 
operational control of the airlines that it oversees?
    Answer. The FAA uses the Safety Assurance System (SAS) to plan and 
perform surveillance on the certificate holders, include heightened 
surveillance when warranted.
Special Technical Audit
    The Committee has received reports of significant systemic problems 
with Boeing's quality control system, including conformity and 
compliance issues with newly-produced aircraft, and ``relentless 
schedule pressure'' leading to breakdowns in the production process. 
The FAA has continued to withhold delegation of authority to Boeing to 
issue airworthiness certificates for both 737 MAX and 787 aircraft, 
which indicates a lack of confidence in Boeing's production quality 
control.
    On January 26, 2023, I requested the FAA initiate a special 
technical audit (STA) of Boeing's production system to identify whether 
there are systemic problems with its quality controls systems or 
supplier controls.

    Question 1. What changes in regulatory oversight of Boeing has FAA 
made since conducting a special technical audit of Boeing's production 
systems in the 1990s?
    Answer. Following the special technical audit of Boeing, the FAA 
revised the regulatory requirements for production approval holders, 
including additional requirements for the quality system and manual. As 
part of these changes, we adjusted our oversight requirements to 
include ongoing audits of the quality system. The FAA also utilizes a 
comprehensive Quality System Audit (QSA) program which evaluates the 
production systems at all production certificate holders, including 
Boeing. The QSA is used to determine if production approval holders, 
their priority parts suppliers, and delegated facilities are complying 
with applicable regulations and the procedures established to meet 
these regulations. The FAA also conducts regular supplier control 
audits to evaluate an approval holder's control of their suppliers.

    Question 2. Please describe the current audits that the FAA is 
undertaking to address concerns with Boeing's quality systems.
    Answer. The FAA regularly conducts oversight activities at Boeing. 
The QSA is used to determine if production approval holders, their 
priority parts suppliers, and delegated facilities are complying with 
applicable regulations and the procedures established to meet these 
regulations. During a QSA, 16 system elements are evaluated by the FAA, 
including supplier control, design data control (including changes to 
approved designs), and quality escapes. The FAA conducted QSAs at 
Boeing facilities in April, May, and June of this year.
    Principal Inspector audits occur more frequently based on risk and 
target focus areas identified during QSAs. The FAA performs product 
audits to ensure parts and articles conform to type design during every 
audit. Additionally, the FAA conducts regular supplier control audits 
to evaluate an approval holder's control of their suppliers.

    Question 3. In conducting these audits and oversight, has the FAA 
identified systemic problems with Boeing's quality control systems or 
supplies controls? If yes, please describe the findings in detail.
    Answer. We have identified noncompliances during audits. When the 
FAA identifies a noncompliance, we require Boeing to conduct root cause 
analysis and develop appropriate corrective action to mitigate the 
issue. The FAA monitors Boeing's corrective action and validates their 
actions to verify their effectiveness.
FAA Certification Workforce and Technical Capacity
    Section 104 of Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability 
Act (``ACSAA'') required FAA to conduct a workforce review of aircraft 
certification staff and other related technical staff to examine and 
address any shortfall in the agency's expertise regarding innovative 
aviation technologies, including future technologies. In its Aviation 
Safety Whistleblower Report, the Committee highlighted the shortage of 
safety engineers in the FAA office overseeing Boeing's ODA.
    I'm disappointed that the FAA has not met this mandate on time or 
finished the work. According to FAA briefings for the Committee staff, 
the FAA anticipates completing the workforce review in 2023.

    Question 1. In the absence of a workforce review, how is the FAA 
able to identify and address any shortfalls in the agency's technical 
and engineering expertise to carry out its certification 
responsibilities?
    Answer. The planned hiring target of 633 FTPs in FY 2023 is driven 
primarily by the continued need to increase safety critical and safety 
technical positions needed to enhance aviation safety oversight. 
Average annual hiring for FY 2023 through FY 2032 is forecasted at 503 
positions, reflecting requirements related to certification and safety 
oversight reform. AVS continues to hire additional staff with expertise 
in human factors, systems safety engineering, software engineering, 
manufacturing and industrial engineering, and data analytics and 
science.

    Question 2. Does the FAA have adequate staffing in place today to 
meet the increased ODA safety responsibilities related to overseeing 
individual ODA unit members at the manufacturers? If so, on what basis 
are you able to make this determination? If the FAA has staffing gaps 
or shortfalls in this space, when can FAA report to Congress on how 
many additional staff, including engineers, that the FAA needs to 
properly conduct certification and oversight activities to inform the 
Committee's FAA reauthorization efforts?
    Answer. The FAA's ODA Office continues to monitor the workload 
associated with implementation of the ODA-related requirements of 
ACSAA, including the assignment of FAA Safety Advisors to engineering 
unit members at certain ODA holders and FAA approval of unit members at 
certain ODA holders. To date, we have not identified any gaps in 
oversight that that the agency is unable to conduct with our current 
staffing levels.

    Question 3. What concrete steps is the FAA taking to recruit and 
train a skilled-technical workforce within the agency to oversee the 
safe certification of advanced and innovative aviation technologies?
    Answer. Recruitment: One avenue to promote FAA hiring incentives 
and flexibilities includes recruitment efforts at professional 
conferences, career fairs, aviation events, and airshows. Another is 
the use of social media. Both are used to reach a greater pool of 
applicants nationwide. Additionally, in alignment with ACSAA, the FAA 
is collaborating with our unions to develop a strategy to improve 
recruitment and retention. This strategy targets a wide group of 
technical employees, including engineers, safety inspectors, human 
factors specialists, chief scientific and technical advisors, and 
software and cybersecurity experts. Currently, the primary recruitment 
and hiring vehicle the FAA uses is the Office of Personnel Management's 
automated application system, USAJOBS. The FAA also uses applicable 
recruitment resources like the On-the-Spot hiring authority to expedite 
the process for hiring aviation safety inspectors and aviation safety 
engineers, as well as physicians. To better compete with aviation 
industry recruitment, the FAA offers a number of incentives, such as 
leave enhancements (included in job announcements), new hire pay 
flexibilities, telework, and degree completion programs.
    Training: After employees complete the initial technical courses, 
the FAA identifies additional training needs during annual calls for 
training requirements. These requirements are role-based and focused on 
competency. Supervisors work with their employees to determine what 
kind of training the employees need and when they need it. Inspectors, 
designee advisors, and flight test pilots are required to receive 
initial and recurrent training tailored to their particular job 
responsibilities. Supervisors and their employees continually review 
training requirements to keep pace with changes in the aviation 
industry.
    We have completed a review of the aviation safety engineer 
competencies and the aviation safety inspector manufacturing 
competencies. In order to assess changing training needs, the Agency is 
also in the process of reviewing existing training to identify and map 
any gaps and/or unnecessary redundancies. Based on this effort training 
will be updated or developed to meet any existing gaps. Aircraft 
certification has in place an ongoing training portfolio review, new 
training requirements process, and maintenance process to ensure 
curriculum is reviewed on an annual basis.
    We have also developed, in partnership with academia and an 
industry standards organization, an Aircraft Certifications Basics 
Course targeted at college level engineers being hired at the G and H 
Band. The course is also available to new hire engineer at higher 
grades if their managers deem they can benefit from the training. We 
have also implemented a technical mentor program where each new hire 
engineer in the G/H grade are assigned a technical mentor.
    Boeing ODA Renewal. In reviewing Boeing's request for a five-year 
renewal for its ODA authorization, the FAA instead issued a decision in 
May 2022 to renew Boeing's ODA for three years. However, this renewal 
was subject to expected improvements and assessments concerning (1) 
interference with and the independence of ODA unit members, (2) 
procedure manual updates, (3) the timely implementation of Boeing's 
Safety Management System, and (4) other corrective actions for safety.
    At the same time, the ODA expert review panel, created by Section 
103 of the aviation safety reform law, is now meeting to review 
Boeing's ODA safety management processes and issue recommendations to 
Congress and the FAA in nine months.
    Over course of the coming months, the FAA and Boeing have the 
opportunity to make safety advances in the ODA program.

    Question 1. What actions has FAA seen the company take to improve 
safety at the Boeing ODA?
    Answer. The FAA has seen a key cultural shift in ensuring a safety 
focus at the executive level within the Boeing company. A key component 
of this is the rollout of Boeing's voluntary safety management system. 
Boeing has updated their ODA Procedures Manual to include the 
requirements of FAA Notice 8100.17, which is aimed at reducing 
interference with the performance of authorized functions by ODA Unit 
Members. Boeing has also taken steps to provide ODA unit members 
additional independence and incentives for qualified staff to become 
ODA Unit members.
    In addition, from a quality perspective, the FAA now has real time 
access to internal production system. This allows the FAA to review 
factory performance for part and quality issues and enables predictive 
analysis, along with the ability to see and assess impacts related to 
Boeing's supply chain.

    Question 2. With close to two years remaining until Boeing's ODA 
authorization is subject to renewal, how will you hold Boeing 
accountable to ensure they address FAA's identified areas for safety 
improvements?
    Answer. The FAA has completed the special qualification review 
required by ACSAA to evaluate all of the Boeing ODA unit member. The 
FAA continues to work with Boeing to implement changes in their 
procedures manual and conducting oversight related to UM interference. 
The FAA is also approving all new unit members for Boeing's ODA and has 
appointed FAA Safety advisors for engineering unit members at Boeing. 
Lastly, the FAA continues to work closely with Boeing to mature their 
voluntary Safety Management System.

    Question 3. In your view, does your oversight and accountability of 
Boeing include withdrawing or limiting the FAA authorization of their 
ODA, if necessary, in the interest of safety?
    Answer. Withdrawing or limiting the authorization of an ODA holder 
is a potential outcome of our oversight and surveillance for any ODA 
holder. The FAA believes it is in the agency's interest to continuously 
improve the effectiveness of the ODA and ensure that their system is 
robust and staffed appropriately with appropriate oversight by the FAA.

    Emerging Safety Trends. Congress mandated under Section 132 of the 
safety reform law a new biennial report to Congress, conducted by the 
Transportation Research Board, identifying emerging safety trends in 
air transportation. This report is supposed to draw upon accident 
investigation data from the National Transportation Safety Board, FAA, 
air operators, and foreign aviation safety authorities to highlight the 
latest trends impacting aviation safety, domestically and 
internationally, so policymakers and FAA can stay ahead of them.
    In August 2022, the Transportation Research Board published a 
report which developed the framework for a biennial analysis and report 
on emerging safety trends in aviation. But Congress has yet to receive 
the safety trends and analysis or specific recommendations for FAA 
action.

    Question 1. As we wait for the Transportation Research Board to 
complete its work, do you commit that FAA will provide the necessary 
information to make sure this Emerging Safety Trends report is 
informative and transparent on what safety work needs to be done?
    Answer. The FAA works closely with the Transportation Research 
Board (TRB) to ensure the board receives the information needed to 
complete work under Section 132 of the Safety Reform Law, and has fully 
funded the FY23 TRB programmed work. The FAA TRB program manager meets 
regularly with the TRB point of contact to share information and 
determine additional data needs. FAA has most recently supported the 
TRB's Strategic Foresight Horizon Scanning workshop, ensuring that FAA 
leaders attend and contribute to the TRB's efforts. This partnership 
has already delivered the first of six required reports, submitted in 
December of 2022. The FAA is now supporting TRB in producing the 2nd 
Bi-annual report, which will be completed in 2024.

    Question 2. There have been a number of near-miss incidents, like 
those in Austin and New York (JFK), and operational deviations, like 
the Boeing 777 flight in Hawaii in December 2022. The FAA Safety Summit 
on March 15 was a welcomed first step in convening leaders across the 
national aviation system to discuss current safety challenges and 
constructive next steps. What concerning safety trends do you see from 
this string of recent incidents? Is FAA planning on working with the 
Transportation Research Board to adapt the emerging safety trends 
report to also account for topics discussed during the safety summit?
    Answer. Recent event analysis has not revealed any clear trends at 
this time, but the FAA is continuing to work in collaboration with 
Government-Industry safety teams such as the Commercial Aviation Safety 
Team (CAST) and General Aviation Joint Safety Committee (GAJSC) to 
investigate and to apply analyses to identify any common root causes or 
suggested enhancements to improve safety. The FAA issued a Safety Alert 
for Operators (SAFO 23002) as an outcome of the Safety Summit Call to 
Action on March 15, 2023 that informed the aviation community of 
several highly visible and notable recent events that demonstrate the 
need for continued vigilance and attention to mitigation of safety 
risks. The Safety Summit Call to Action is relevant to the work of the 
TRB and the FAA will continue to support the TRB and provide any new 
findings related to ongoing safety analysis and investigations into 
future TRB reports.

    Improving FAA Safety Culture. Section 132 of the safety reform law 
requires the Administrator to conduct an annual safety culture 
assessment, through Fiscal Year 2031. This includes surveying all 
employees in the FAA's Aviation Safety organization (``AVS'') to 
determine their opinions regarding AVS' safety culture and 
implementation of any voluntary safety reporting program.
    However, FAA has only completed one safety culture assessment so 
far--despite the Congressional mandate for an assessment to be 
conducted each year. Therefore, it has been difficult for Congress and 
FAA to measure progress at the agency in terms of improved safety 
culture.

    Question 1. I fully expect FAA will be completing and reporting 
safety culture surveys to Congress on time moving forward. Do I have 
your commitment to get this done?
    Answer. Yes, the FAA completed the initial safety culture survey in 
2022 in conjunction with OPM and a contractor. The FAA is in the 
planning phases for a follow on survey to be conducted in 2023 and is 
committed to conducting the safety culture survey annually as required 
by ACSAA.

    Question 2. The 2022 survey identified what the workforce 
considered serious weaknesses in FAA senior leadership performance. 
Specifically, employees identified slow decision-making and action from 
leadership, and a lack of transparency surrounding the logic behind 
decisions. Employees said when they identify problems their immediate 
supervisors normally help to correct them, but when looking beyond the 
direct supervisor level of leadership, results indicate a fear of blame 
for mistakes. What immediate actions are you taking to address this 
issue?
    Answer. The FAA has implemented a voluntary safety reporting 
program, which allows employees to report safety concerns, either 
anonymously or not, and provides a structured process to evaluate and 
follow up to reported safety concerns. The FAA continues to monitor the 
effectiveness of the program, including through the results of the 
safety culture survey, and make appropriate changes to enhance its 
effectiveness.

    Question 3. How can FAA maintain strong safety oversight while also 
becoming more adaptable and evolving to keep pace with changes in the 
aviation industry and technological advancements?
    Answer. The adoption of safety management systems (SMS) throughout 
the aviation industry is key to allowing the FAA to conduct holistic 
and effective oversight of the aviation industry. SMS is an 
organization-wide approach to managing safety risk and assuring the 
effectiveness of safety risk controls. It includes systematic 
procedures, practices, and policies for the management of safety risk.
    The FAA is revising Order 8100.15, Organization Designation 
Authorization Procedures, which will introduce a risk-based oversight 
approach for ODA holders to more effectively align our oversight 
resources with the areas of highest risk, including in new areas of 
technological advancement. Additionally, to keep pace with changes in 
the aviation industry, the FAA has been moving towards performance-
based regulations, such as in 14 CFR part 23. These new performance-
based regulations now establish safety objectives versus prescriptive 
design requirements, which fosters innovation and the safe adoption of 
technology.

    Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Tammy Baldwin to 
                              Billy Nolen
    In the Fiscal Year 2023 omnibus legislation (P.L. 117-328), 
Congress tasked FAA, in coordination with DOD and the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), with developing a transition plan for part 139 
airports to the MIL-SPEC within 120 days after the MIL-SPEC was 
released. That transition plan is due by May 6, 2023.

    Question. Given the importance of this plan to better serve 
airports across the country, as well as the communities they serve, I 
sent a letter with several of my colleagues to you about the need to 
complete this vital plan no later than the due date of May 6. Can you 
commit to meeting that deadline?
    Answer. The FAA completed its transition plan and shared it with 
Part 139 airports on May 8, 2023. We worked with the Department of 
Defense, the Environmental Protection Agency and industry stakeholders, 
including airports who employ firefighters who specialize in emergency 
aircraft response, to develop the plan.

  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tammy Duckworth to 
                              Billy Nolen
Topic: Civil Enforcement Authority
    An internal Boeing memo that surfaced as a result of Congressional 
investigation [enclosed] appears to document a plan to avoid using the 
term ``MCAS'' outside of the company and described the new function as 
an addition to the already existing Speed Trim system. Towards the 
bottom of the memo an Authorized Representative who is Boeing employee 
that FAA specifically authorized to conduct certification on behalf of 
FAA approved the plan to downplay the significance of MCAS.

    Question 1. Is this Authorized Representative still authorized to 
perform certification work on behalf of FAA?
    Answer. The FAA does not know the names of the individuals 
referenced. This question would be best answered by The Boeing Company.

    Question 2. I'm not asking for names, but has FAA identified the 
individuals whose plan appears to be documented in these meeting 
minutes?
    Answer. The FAA does not know the names of the individuals 
referenced. This question would be best answered by The Boeing Company.

    Question 3. Are the individuals behind this Boeing document still 
working at Boeing, and if so are they working on aircraft 
certifications?
    Answer. The FAA does not know the names of the individuals 
referenced. This question would be best answered by The Boeing Company.
Topic: Civil Penalties
    In 2021, FAA announced that Boeing settled a civil lawsuit 
enforcement action and would pay at least $17 million in penalties for 
using sensors that were not approved for certain equipment installed on 
the Boeing 737 MAX and NG aircraft. Under the agreement Boeing would 
have to pay an additional $10 million if it did not complete corrective 
actions within a certain time frame. For context, Boeing reported $20 
billion in revenue in just the fourth quarter of 2022. A $17 million 
penalty is just .08 percent of Boeing's fourth quarter revenue.

    Question 1. Are the sizes of FAA civil penalties large enough to 
deter bad behavior from large manufacturers?
    Answer. When calculating civil penalties, the FAA uses the Small 
Business Administration's North American Industry Classification System 
(NAICS) to determine if a manufacturer qualifies as a small or large 
business. For aircraft manufacturers, the NAICS threshold to qualify as 
a small business is 1,500 employees. Once the FAA determines the 
manufacturer's size, we assess a civil penalty for regulatory 
violations within the statutory limits established by Congress. Based 
on informal information the FAA has received from industry 
stakeholders, the deterrent effect increases with higher assessed civil 
penalties.

    Question 2. If Congress increased the cap on civil penalties, would 
that have a greater deterrent effect?
    Answer. Yes, based on informal information the FAA has received 
from industry stakeholders, increased civil penalties may have a 
greater deterrent effect.

    Advanced Air Mobility Sector. As you know, safety must always be 
the top priority that guides everything the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) undertakes. However, part of the responsibility to 
constantly protect aviation safety is to ensure that technological 
advances are allowed to proceed effectively while being placed within a 
properly defined regulatory structure. One such important area of 
technological advancement is the emerging advanced air mobility (AAM) 
sector, whose promising new concepts of air transportation using 
electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) could have tremendous 
benefits to currently underserved places for moving people and cargo. 
The eVTOL aircraft behind AAM may be powered by hybrid electric 
systems, batteries, or even hydrogen fuel cells and AAM aircraft will 
likely range in size from single passenger vehicles to large shuttles, 
increasing accessibility to urban centers and underserved communities. 
In order to realize such potential benefits and foster American 
leadership in AAM, the FAA must establish the necessary regulatory 
requirements for commercial operations and pilot certification for 
eVTOL vehicles.

    Question 1. Is the FAA on track to meet its announced completion 
date of December 2024 to establish this regulatory architecture that 
will allow for the commercial entry of AAM aircraft? If not, what is 
delaying this process?
    Answer. On June 14, 2023, the FAA published the notice of proposed 
rulemaking titled Integration of Powered-Lift: Pilot Certification and 
Operations; Miscellaneous Amendments Related to Rotorcraft and 
Airplanes. The comment period closes on August 14, 2023, after which 
the FAA will adjudicate comments and finalize the rule.

    Question 2. What is the FAA doing to help ensure the development of 
infrastructure in support of AAM given the expectation that AAM will 
become increasingly important in the near future?
    Answer. The FAA is working to safely integrate AAM operations in an 
efficient, sustainable, and repeatable manner. To ensure a coordinated 
approach, the FAA has established innovation teams (iTeams) that lead 
key focus areas such as aircraft and operational certification, 
airspace and air traffic management, and vertiports. The iTeams are 
developing an implementation plan that will contain a Concept of Use 
and schedule for the FAA's vision of AAM operations.
    The FAA is also building a structured approach to support the 
expected evolution of AAM. This includes preparing for near-term early 
entry-into-service operations based on industry plans, mid-term 
operations such as the operationalization of AAM at a key site in 2028 
(Innovate28), and fully mature AAM operations.
    In response to the AAM Coordination and Leadership Act, the FAA is 
playing a key role in the DOT's Interagency Working Group (IWG) to 
identify cross-agency gaps and activities. The IWG is ensuring an all 
of government approach to AAM, to ensure aircraft, air traffic, safety, 
security, frequency spectrum, infrastructure, automation, and other 
areas of focus are appropriately incorporated. The IWG is looking 
outside of the FAA's authority (e.g., electrification, and local land 
use issues) related to AAM to ensure these issues are being taken into 
consideration.

      Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ted Budd to 
                              Billy Nolen
    Question 1. In November and December, the FAA issued its first two 
sets of proposed certification requirements for eVTOL aircraft in the 
Federal Register for public comment. There was a concerted effort by 
European interests to use this opportunity to sway the FAA to adopt its 
more onerous approach to eVTOL aircraft certification. Does the FAA 
intend to adopt European regulatory standards when it responds to the 
public comments? How do we ensure continued U.S. leadership on Advanced 
Air Mobility?
    Answer. While European interests provided comments during the 
public comment period for the eVTOL airworthiness standards, the FAA 
will adjudicate and respond to all comments in accordance with the 
standards that make sense for the safety levels and operations in the 
National Airspace System (NAS). After engaging with over two dozen AAM/
eVTOL manufacturers from the United States, Europe, and Brazil, the FAA 
is in a good position to partner and collaborate with industry to 
develop and refine airworthiness criteria that provide an appropriate 
level of safety to the flying public. We will continue to harmonize 
with international authorities as appropriate, but we will not waver in 
other areas or adopt standards that would lead to overprescribing 
regulations.
    Question 2. In the three most recent FAA Reauthorization Acts, 
Congress directed FAA and DOT to conduct over three dozen rulemakings 
and nearly 200 reports. The FAA missed the congressionally directed 
deadline for most of these rulemakings and reports, and some have yet 
to be completed. FAA cannot treat Congressional deadlines enacted in 
law as mere suggestions. Accordingly, please provide the following 
information:

  a.  A list of the rulemakings Congress directed FAA or DOT to issue 
        in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (Pub. L. 112-
        95), FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 (Pub. L. 
        114-190), and FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-254) 
        for which a final rule has not been promulgated.

                                                      issues raised by
                                                      the comments
                                                      received to
                                                      determine the next
                                                      action.

  b.  For each rulemaking listed in paragraph (a), provide the status 
        of the rulemaking and an estimated date a final rule will be 
        promulgated.
    Answer. See detailed responses provided for the previous question.

  c.  A list of the reports Congress directed FAA or DOT to issue in 
        the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (Pub. L. 112-95), 
        FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 (Pub. L. 114-
        190), and FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-254). 
        For each report, indicate whether the report is publicly 
        available on the FAA's website or another government website 
        and include a link to such reports.
    Answer. See attached spreadsheet.

  d.  For each report described in paragraph (c) that has not been 
        completed, provide an estimated date the report will complete.
    Answer. See attachment included for previous response.

    Question 3. In response to my question about implementing three 
most recent FAA Reauthorization Acts, Acting Administrator Nolen stated 
``we certainly across the agency and the Department continue to look 
for ways to streamline our own internal processes to make sure that we 
are faster.'' Can you explain some specific steps the FAA is taking to 
streamline its regulatory process?
    Answer. The Office of the Administrator has taken steps to improve 
the efficiency and timeliness of its review process and has tasked 
agency executives responsible for reviewing rules for alignment with 
agency rulemaking policies to find similar ways to improve their review 
time.
    We are continuing to explore numerous ways to streamline our 
efforts, including assessing the efficiency and timeliness of the 
current FAA rulemaking process. Efforts include identifying 
availability and appropriateness of alternatives to the existing 
rulemaking process and improvements to reduce the amount of time 
associated with the existing rulemaking process.

    Question 4. Aside from waiving the Administrative Procedure Act and 
Executive Order 12866, what can Congress do to assist DOT and FAA in 
speeding up the rulemaking process, particularly for rules that 
Congress directs the agency to issue?
    Answer. There are instances in which self-enacting legislation can 
be appropriate and we would be pleased to work with you to provide 
technical assistance in those instances. It is also important to keep 
in mind that under notice and comment rulemaking the FAA must 
demonstrate the cost-benefit associated with a rule. So if Congress 
prescribes rules that are not supported by robust underlying safety 
data those rules will likely not succeed under a fast timeline and that 
is not because the agency is ignoring the direction but because the 
directed rulemaking cannot comply with the other statutory rules 
Congress has established for the rulemaking process.

                                 ______
                                 
    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. J. D. Vance to 
                              Billy Nolen
    At the ACSAA oversight and implementation hearing (March 8, 2023), 
I made reference to two recent Boeing 737-Max incidents regarding 
stabilizer trimming issues: American Airlines Flight 2692 (#N306SW; 
Miami International Airport; 1/20/23) and Southwest Flight 9017 
(#N8844Q; Phoenix Airport; 2/24/23). In response to my questions about 
the safety and certification of the 737-Max, you suggested that you did 
not want to prejudge the cause of these failures and asked for the 
opportunity to investigate further.

    Question 1. Regarding the two incidents mentioned, has the agency 
determined the root cause of the trim failures on these new aircraft. 
What was the cause? Where in the production line should the problems 
have been caught and prevented? Are there other aircraft that may have 
the same problem? What has been done to prevent recurrence of the 
system failure?
    Answer. The incidents were not caused by faulty software or 
inadequate system design. They appear to be related to failed breakers 
or relays. They resulted in an inoperative electric stabilizer trim 
motor. Certification of the airplane is based on a requirement to have 
a fail-safe design and on the need for the continued safe flight and 
landing in the case of loss of electric stabilizer trim. When the 
electric trim is inoperative, the flight crew is trained to follow 
procedures which include the use of manual trim (by use of mechanical 
cables). The need for manual trim training was emphasized during the 
return to service of the MAX. As such, we do not consider this a safety 
of flight issue. Further, the FAA continues to monitor the 737 MAX for 
in service events and there are no negative trends related to the 
breakers or relays.

    Question 2. A review of the System Difficulty Reports (SDR) data 
show 137 pilot reports of flight control problems in new 737 MAX 
aircraft in 2022 alone (see attached spreadsheet). These pilot-reported 
flight control problems include failures in stabilizer trim, autopilot, 
auto throttle, flight management computers. In several cases, in-flight 
emergencies were declared. It would seem the issues go beyond the two 
incidents above. According to this data, these issues are also not 
present in comparable aircraft of comparable age. Please provide 
information on whether the MAX indeed has more pilot declared problems 
than comparable aircraft and the basis for your conclusion. As to those 
SDR incidents, have you determined the cause of the flight control 
problems? What is the cause? Is it production quality control related? 
How many other aircraft are potentially subject to these problems? What 
did the root cause analysis show? What remedial action has been taken?
    Answer. It does not appear that the MAX has more pilot declared 
problems than comparable aircraft. In comparing to a similar aircraft 
in size, use, and age (from the time of certification), the Airbus A320 
NEO fleet at entry into service experienced a higher SDR rate per 
aircraft as compared to the mature fleet. In addition, the MAX had 
fewer SDRs reported per aircraft in service per month in comparison to 
the NEO over the same time-period.
    SDRs are a critical component in safety management for an 
operational fleet. In most cases, the issues reported in an SDR do not 
represent a safety concern. SDR data aids the FAA Certificate 
Management Office (CMO), the operator, and the manufacturer to 
understand the reliability of the fleet. The FAA continues to monitor 
the reliability of the fleet and all reportable safety issues.
    On a similar note, in light of the upcoming Federal Aviation 
Administration's reauthorization this year, I would like clarity on the 
following:

    Question 3. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254) 
created an Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC) to gather all 
stakeholders and develop recommendations to improve Part 135 pilot rest 
and duty rules. The ARC submitted its proposals in July 2021.\1\ The 
2018 Reauthorization law also directed the FAA to issue an NPRM based 
on those recommendations. According to the ARC, the 2018 FAA Act's 
directive to advance an NPRM on the Part 135 ARC consensus 
recommendations is still pending with the Agency. Could you please 
provide me and the Committee with an update on how the FAA intends to 
proceed on the ARC's recommendations?

254_Sec315_Pilot_Rest_and_Duty
_Rules.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer. The FAA included reference to the ARC report required by 
the 2018 Reauthorization Act in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
(NPRM) for Safety Management Systems, which published on January 11, 
2022. In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to require all part 119 certificate 
holders authorized to operate under part 135 and applicants for those 
certificates to develop and implement an SMS that meets the part 5 
requirements. This aligns the proposed part 5 applicability with ICAO 
Annex 19 and with other civil aviation authorities that generally do 
not differentiate between size and complexity of air carriers. The 
identification of hazards through SMS may include analyzing the 
potential risk associated with crewmember fatigue when compounded by 
variations in individual 135 operations, such as scheduling variances, 
frequency of operations, distance, and number of pilots.
                                 ______
                                 
Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Shelley Moore Capito to 

                              Billy Nolen
    Mr. Nolen, my top priority in the certification bill was mandating 
the FAA to issue updated aviation maintenance technician school (AMTS) 
certificates. My state has a vibrant AMTS community with Fairmont State 
and Pierpont, both offer great opportunities to learn the skills to 
become excellent AMTs which are critical to keeping the skies safe.

    Question 1. Can you tell us how this updated AMTS rule has 
benefited the pipeline for technicians and schools?
    Answer. On May 24, 2022, the Part 147 interim final rule was 
published in the Federal Register with an effective date of September 
21, 2022. On the date the rule took effect, 99 percent of the 189 
Aviation Maintenance Technician Schools (AMTS) were compliant with the 
regulatory requirements, which is a testament to the extensive outreach 
and education campaign conducted by the FAA and industry leading to the 
compliance date, and the considerable work by industry to prepare for 
the new requirements. The new regulations offer a performance-based 
standard providing greater flexibility for the AMTS in areas such as 
curriculum development and content, course delivery options, 
recognition of their Department of Education accreditation, and other 
areas. AMTS curriculum now align with the Airmen Certification 
Standards (ACS), providing alignment between training and testing. AMTS 
also now have the opportunity to provide training at additional 
locations other than its primary location, including locations outside 
of the United States.

    Question 2. Are there ways that this updated rule could have moved 
through the rulemaking process faster?
    Answer. The FAA agrees that AMTS play a vital role in the aviation 
system, and that its rulemaking in this area took far too long to 
finalize. The initial notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), published 
in 2015, endeavored to update requirements but, as comments 
demonstrated, was not sufficiently comprehensive. In a supplemental 
notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) published in 2019, the FAA 
considered expansion of scope from the original NPRM, and a subsequent 
interim final rule was published May 24, 2022.
    In retrospect, there were several ways that the FAA could have 
expedited this process. For example, the FAA could have addressed the 
topics in the SNPRM in a separate rulemaking document while moving 
forward with those areas of the NPRM that were not impacted by the 
SNPRM. In addition, when the FAA attempts to make an extensive overhaul 
of a particular section of its regulations, these types of rules can be 
slowed as the rulemaking team attempts to identify every potential 
unintended consequence of the rule change. While the FAA strives to 
ensure accuracy and thoroughness in all rulemaking documents, 
perfection at the expense of useful expediency when alternative 
solutions (e.g., waivers or exemptions) are available creates its own 
complications.
    I also supported having Mechanic Airman Certification Standards 
(ACS) updates included in a final rule, and I'm glad they were.

    Question 3. Has the FAA heard from schools about any challenges in 
complying with these new standards?
    Answer. There are about 190 FAA-certificated part 147 programs that 
enroll approximately 20,000 students across the United States, and the 
feedback from these schools has been that there have been minimal 
challenges with the transition to ACS. The AMTS community has applauded 
the new rule and believes it provides the opportunity to modernize and 
reorganize curriculum requirements with much needed flexibility in 
subject matter selection and instruction delivery methods.
