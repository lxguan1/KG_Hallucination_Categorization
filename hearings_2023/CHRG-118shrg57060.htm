  EXAMINING PUBLIC SAFETY AND JUSTICE RESOURCES IN NATIVE COMMUNITIES

                              ----------                              


                        WEDNESDAY, MAY 22, 2024


                                       U.S. Senate,
                               Committee on Indian Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:32 p.m. in room 
628, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Brian Schatz, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN SCHATZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII

    The Chairman. Good afternoon. I call this oversight hearing 
to order.
    As this Committee well knows, one of the fundamental trust 
and treaty obligations to tribal nations is to protect the 
public safety on their lands. As early as the 19th century and 
as recently as 2022, Congress has affirmed and reaffirmed this 
obligation, from the General Crimes Act of 1817 to the Tribal 
Law and Order Act of 2010, and even more recently with the 
Savanna's Act, the Not Invisible Act and the reauthorization of 
the Violence Against Women Act. We have recommited and doubled 
down on our obligation.
    Yet, it is abundantly clear that public safety challenges 
persist. The Committee's record is filled with examples of 
these challenges: inadequate Federal funding and public safety 
resources, including law enforcement and corrections personnel; 
patchwork criminal jurisdiction; deteriorating and unsafe 
jails, or sometimes no jails at all; the crisis of missing and 
murdered indigenous people; and the devastating impacts of 
fentanyl, just to name a few.
    With an evolving legal landscape, most notably with the 
Supreme Court's decision in McGirt, these resource-based 
challenges have become more acute. So when the Committee 
received renewed calls to focus on public safety matters, we 
answered.
    First, with our listening session in March, when over 600 
individuals listened in and commenters overwhelmingly listed 
MMIP and law enforcement officer recruitment and retention 
challenges as top priorities. Second, with our legislative 
hearing earlier this month on two bipartisan bills that would 
address both these priorities in meaningful ways.
    And today with our oversight hearing, we will hear from 
Federal witnesses whose agencies are directly responsible for 
ensuring public safety and providing victim services in Native 
communities.
    In short, this oversight hearing has been purposefully 
informed by priorities that tribal leaders and Native 
stakeholders uplifted in our listening session and legislative 
hearing. It gives the DOI, Justice and HHS the chance to 
respond and testify about how they are addressing unmet public 
safety needs and implementing the laws that Congress passed to 
address those needs.
    It is also the Committee's opportunity to remind our 
Executive Branch partners that the United States must do 
everything it can to live up to the trust and treaty 
responsibility, to protect the public safety of American 
Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians.
    Before I turn to Vice Chair Murkowski for her opening 
statement, I would like to thank all of our witnesses for 
joining us today.
    Vice Chair Murkowski?

               STATEMENT OF HON. LISA MURKOWSKI, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome to 
our witnesses. I really appreciate that we are having this 
oversight hearing today. I think it is one of those areas that, 
regardless of the part of the Country that you are from or your 
political party, this is something that we all care deeply 
about. I am honored to have worked with Native leaders in 
Alaska and across the Nation over multiple Congresses on these 
issues of public safety.
    This Committee has been a great forum to both shed light on 
the need to improve public safety and justice in Native 
communities, and also taking concrete steps to address the 
problem. We saw that through passage of VAWA 2022, which 
included the tribal title that we authored.
    My thanks to the Alaska Native Women's Resource Center, the 
Alaska Native Justice Center, the Alaska Federation of Natives 
and so many other powerful advocates who have partnered with us 
on solutions. Through listening to tribal leaders and 
advocates, we have learned how a lack of resources, combined 
with jurisdictional complexities, have contributed to a crisis 
of missing and murdered indigenous people at a 
disproportionately high rate of victimization.
    Based on this record and testimony, I think we have seen 
some real concrete steps to empower tribes to strengthen their 
own justice systems, both through changing law and increasing 
Federal resources.
    Tribes in P.L. 280 States have been calling for more 
support for tribal courts and law enforcement for years, even 
decades now. About a decade ago, the Indian Law and Order 
Commission issued its report which confirmed what all of us 
already knew, and that was Federal investment in tribal justice 
for P.L. 280 States is more limited than elsewhere in Indian 
Country.
    So in 2015, we directed BIA and DOJ to report on the 
budgetary needs of tribal courts in these States. We were able 
to follow up with funding, and the next year appropriated $10 
million for tribal courts in P.L. 280 States. Since then, we 
have continued to build on that support. In the Fiscal Year 
2024 Interior spending bill, we now have it at $21 million.
    This year, I was also able to include some language that 
directs BIA to conduct consultation on the budgetary needs in 
P.L. 280 States for tribal law enforcement as well as courts 
and other judicial needs, then to report back on available 
funding, whether that is at DOI or elsewhere. This all takes 
time, this is work. But know that there are so many of us that 
are really committed to keeping that momentum going.
    In Alaska, we all know the need for additional law 
enforcement and justice systems is so great. As many as one in 
three Native villages lack any law enforcement presence at all. 
Recognizing that there is no better way to understand the 
impact of these unique challenges than to visit in person, I 
have hosted two U.S. Attorneys General up to Alaska to see the 
impacts of these challenges on the ground. So whether you are 
in Bethel, Napakiak, Napaskiak, Galena, Huslia, or Anchorage, 
everyone deserves to live in a safe community. We need the 
commitment of our Federal partners, and in this area, I think 
we are making some progress.
    Last Congress, there were many of us here who helped to 
author and negotiate VAWA 2022. As part of that, I was able to 
include the Alaska Tribal Public Safety Empowerment Act. This 
pilot project supplements the work that the State of Alaska is 
doing with regard to public safety.
    It was an Alaska-specific solution in that it did not 
create any new Indian Country, nor did it take away any 
jurisdiction from the State. Now we are in this critical moment 
when the tribes have a chance to implement some of these newly 
affirmed authorities.
    The Alaska Intertribal Working Group met just a couple of 
weeks ago in Fairbanks for the very first time. I want to thank 
everyone who is working on those efforts. When we were thinking 
about how Alaska could be included as part of VAWA 2022, we 
knew that we were going to need an approach that would be 
Alaska-focused.
    Native communities in different regions have such different 
needs and various obstacles to funding and resources. So I am 
going to be looking forward to hearing how DOJ is working to 
support tribes across the Country and in particular, how they 
can help address the well-documented law enforcement emergency 
in rural Alaska.
    Of course, it is also important to set up systems that 
require coordination across all levels of government, such as 
what we have done with Savanna's Act. We have also gotten the 
recommendations from the Not Invisible Commission, which I was 
so pleased to be able to co-lead with my friend, Senator Cortez 
Masto.
    But we have more to do to ensure proper implementation of 
these laws and taking action on the commission's 
recommendations. Now is the time for continued partnerships and 
building accountable systems across governments.
    So I am looking forward to the testimony today and the 
discussion with our witnesses at this very, very important 
hearing.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Vice Chair Murkowski, and happy 
birthday.
    Senator Cantwell?

               STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    Senator Cantwell. Yes, Mr. Chairman, happy birthday to the 
Vice Chair. I would sing, but I don't quite have a voice. She 
does have a Hawaiian lei on, maybe you should try. No?
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Cantwell. I so appreciate the Senator from Alaska 
and her hard work on behalf of Indian Country and certainly on 
murdered and missing indigenous people. Thank you.
    Thanks for having, this is the third hearing we have had on 
law enforcement. Very much appreciate that. According to the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs, tribal communities need over 13,600 
additional law enforcement personnel just to meet the FBI's 
Community Safe standard. So that means that many tribes do not 
have enough law enforcement to tackle these big problems like 
fentanyl, or murdered and missing indigenous people.
    So these hearings have shone a light on the importance of 
passing legislation to strengthen that effort. The Yakima 
Nation police department has less than one quarter of the 
police officers needed to patrol its 1.4 million acre 
reservation and serve 30,000 residents. So clearly, they need 
more support.
    Currently, State and Federal law enforcement can provide 
retirement and other types of compensation benefits that tribes 
can't provide to law enforcement. So this disparity means even 
though tribes have been trying to keep up, we have had a great 
deal of problems keeping commissioned officers.
    The Chief of the Tulalip Police Department testified before 
this Committee earlier this month. His department lost 
approximately 50 percent of their commissioned officers due to 
retirement and by non-tribal jurisdiction overtime. The 
Kalispell Tribe lost nine officers over a five-year period the 
same way. The Colville have struggled to keep three officers on 
duty per shift patrol. The Colville is basically the size of 
the State of Delaware, so it is a pretty big geography to 
patrol.
    So that is why Senator Mullin and I introduced the Parity 
for Tribal Law Enforcement Act that we discussed, S. 2695. Mr. 
Chairman, I appreciate, many of us know how bad the fentanyl 
problem is, and part of it is if you know there is not adequate 
law enforcement, it becomes a haven for people to locate and to 
try to hide production or trade or sales of that product.
    So helping law enforcement will help all our communities. 
Thank you for this hearing.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cantwell.
    We will now turn to our testifiers. First, we have the 
Honorable Bryan Newland, Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs 
at the Department of Interior. We also are pleased to have the 
Honorable Patrice Kunesh, Commissioner, Administration on 
Native Americans at the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, and Ms. Allison Randall, Principal Deputy Director, 
Office on Violence Against Women, at the United States 
Department of Justice.
    We will remind the witnesses that we have your full 
testimony and it will be made part of the official record. 
Please keep your statements confined to five minutes or less.
    With that, Assistant Secretary, please proceed with your 
testimony.

          STATEMENT OF HON. BRYAN NEWLAND, ASSISTANT 
       SECRETARY, INDIAN AFFAIRS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE 
                            INTERIOR

    Mr. Newland. Megwiich, Mr. Chairman. Thank you so much for 
having me back here again to testify. Aanii bozhoo, good 
afternoon, Chairman Schatz and Vice Chair Murkowski. Mino-
dibishkaa, happy birthday from all of us as well.
    I want to thank you for the opportunity to present the 
department's testimony on public safety and justice in Indian 
Country. As I say every time I come here, the United States has 
a trust relationship and trust obligation to each of the 574 
federally recognized tribes in our Nation. All branches of our 
government have a trust obligation to protect the continued 
existence of Indian tribes and the physical safety of Indian 
people.
    Congress has commissioned many reports to investigate the 
public safety concerns of tribal communities, and each report 
reaches the same conclusion: we need to address big structural 
changes to guarantee the safety of people in tribal 
communities.
    The Department remains committed to strengthening tribal 
law enforcement agencies throughout Indian Country. Fulfilling 
our commitment requires us to increase funding, address 
jurisdictional complexities, and provide other much-needed 
resources for personnel.
    Our 2021 Tribal Law and Order Act report to Congress 
estimate the total cost for public safety and justice programs 
in Indian Country is over $3 billion; $1.7 billion is needed 
for law enforcement programs; $284 million is needed for 
existing detention facilities; and $1.5 billion is needed for 
tribal courts.
    In that same report, we explained that the BIA has spent 
$246 million on tribal law enforcement, $123 million for 
detention facilities, and $62.8 million for tribal courts. It 
is clear that there is a massive gap between present funding 
levels and our total obligation to public safety in Indian 
Country.
    In Fiscal Years 2022 and 2023 we were able to work with 
Congress to secure and additional $131 million for public 
safety and justice programs in Indian Country. But even with 
those increases, we are still funding these programs at only 13 
percent of our total need.
    In addition, 52 percent of the increased funding was 
directed by appropriations to just 16 tribes. That left only 
$11.5 million in additional funding to distribute across 182 
tribes in our Nation.
    Utilizing our current budget, the BIA has worked to improve 
our law enforcement operations by focusing on recruitment and 
cutting our attrition rate. One area where we have done that is 
our focus on pay parity for BIA law enforcement officers to 
ensure that they match their counterparts in other Federal 
agencies. We are continuing to reduce the time to hire for our 
own officers.
    I recently appeared before this Committee to support 
legislation that would assist the BIA in eliminating one of the 
biggest obstacles to recruitment, the lengthy background 
investigation process, and expedite the hiring of qualified law 
enforcement officers.
    Those officers must understand the complex jurisdictional 
issues within Indian Country. Jurisdiction in Indian Country 
depends on a matrix of the ownership status of the land and the 
tribal status of the individuals involved. Those issues must be 
resolved before an investigation can even begin, and if those 
issues aren't resolved, investigations can become stalled or 
overlooked entirely.
    This patchwork of jurisdiction adds transaction costs to 
policing in Indian Country that other law enforcement agencies 
simply don't have to deal with. Congress has legislated to 
clarify and affirm tribal jurisdiction in Indian Country, 
including through the 2022 reauthorization of the Violence 
Against Women Act.
    VAWA has reaffirmed Indian tribes' inherent jurisdiction to 
prosecute non-Indians for additional crimes committed in Indian 
Country. Reaffirming tribal criminal jurisdiction is consistent 
with the core principle of self-determination. The Indian 
tribes are the best situated to meet the health, welfare and 
safety needs of their communities.
    We also ask law enforcement recruits to relocate to rural 
tribal communities where there is too often a lack of available 
housing. Poor roads generate greater wear and tear on public 
safety vehicles, and old communications equipment and internet 
service gaps put the safety of our officers at risk. 
Correctional facilities need to be updated or replaced, and 
tribal courts need to be fully staffed to ensure that their 
citizens are able to have justice.
    A number of reports commissioned by Congress have affirmed 
that these structural challenges make it harder to keep people 
safe in Indian Country. We all know what we have to do. 
Addressing these challenges requires coordination across the 
Federal Government with Congress and with tribal leaders. It is 
a challenge we must meet.
    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you once again for having me 
back here today, and I look forward to answering questions from 
members of the Committee.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Newland follows:]

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Bryan Newland, Assistant Secretary, Indian 
                Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior
    Aanii (Hello)! Good afternoon Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman 
Murkowski, and members of the Committee. My name is Bryan Newland, and 
I am the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs at the Department of 
the Interior (Department). Thank you for the opportunity to present 
testimony on public safety and justice resources for Native 
communities.
    The United States has a trust relationship with each of the 574 
federally recognized Tribes and their Tribal citizens. Through these 
relationships, the United States has charged itself with obligations of 
the highest responsibility and trust-including the obligation to 
protect the existence of Indian Tribes and their citizens. This 
obligation is at its highest when it comes to protecting the physical 
safety and well-being of Indian people within Indian Country.
    The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) plays a crucial role in meeting 
this obligation on behalf of the United States.
    Under President Biden and Secretary Haaland's leadership, the 
Department has been working to improve our ability to meet our trust 
obligations to Indian Country, and to partner with Tribes to make their 
communities safer. For example, Secretary Haaland established the 
Missing and Murdered Unit (MMU) within the BIA just months after taking 
office. The MMU works closely with the Department of Justice, 
especially the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), to coordinate a 
centralized intake process for missing and murdered case referrals and 
conduct investigative activities on current and previously unsolved 
investigations. On May 25, 2022, President Biden issued Executive Order 
14074, ``Advancing Effective, Accountable Policing and Criminal Justice 
Practices to Enhance Public Trust and Public Safety,'' to ensure 
agencies across the federal government, including public health 
agencies, are working together to improve the recruitment, retention, 
and mental well-being of public safety officers. On November 22, 2022, 
the Department executed a new interagency agreement with the Department 
of Justice to ensure better coordination with the FBI on criminal 
investigations in Indian Country.
    The BIA has also partnered with Tribes to step up enforcement 
operations to combat the trafficking of illicit drugs in communities on 
Reservations across the nation. Drug trafficking and drug-related 
crime, including the ongoing opioid and methamphetamine crises, 
continue to escalate throughout Indian Country. Tribal officials have 
consistently called for action toward addressing an increasingly common 
cause of Indian Country crime by strengthening drug enforcement 
capabilities throughout the Nation. The Office of Justice Services 
(OJS) Division of Drug Enforcement (DDE) operates the largest 
nationwide network of drug enforcement agents dedicated solely to 
Indian Country. Table 1 and Table 2 demonstrate that the OJS DDE is 
making an impact by intercepting illicit drugs in Indian Country. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ For example, Table 1 below contains drug seizure data from the 
Division of Drug Enforcement from 2015 to 2023. Table 2 contains 
fentanyl seizure data from fiscal years 2018 to 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    And the Administration has worked with this Committee, and with all 
of Congress, to support legislation and enact laws to improve public 
safety in Indian Country, including the historic reauthorization of the 
Violence Against Women Act.
    Yet, there are many structural challenges that make it difficult 
for federal agencies and Tribes to fully ensure public safety in 
communities across Indian Country. I would like to focus on those 
structural challenges below.
Funding
    Presently, the Department funds public safety and justice services 
for only 198 out of the total 574 federally recognized Tribes. On March 
4, 2024, the Department issued the ``Report to the Congress on 
Spending, Staffing, and Estimated Funding Costs for Public Safety and 
Justice Programs in Indian Country, 2021'' (2021 TLOA report). \2\ This 
report contains data for funding costs in Indian Country. In 2021, 
total BIA spending for law enforcement was $446.7 million, $125 million 
for detention facilities, and $65.3 million for Tribal courts. The 2021 
TLOA report estimates the total cost for public safety and justice 
programs is $1.7 billion for law enforcement programs, $284.2 million 
for existing detention centers, and $1.5 billion for Tribal courts. 
Thus, the total estimated unmet obligations identified in the 2021 TLOA 
report for Tribal law enforcement, detention, and courts funding are 
just over $3 billion. The total estimated public safety and justice 
staffing need for Indian Country is 29,436 full time equivalent 
personnel. These numbers demonstrate the continued need for additional 
investment to improve the ability of Tribal public safety systems to 
fully serve their communities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To get more boots on the ground, BIA is utilizing different methods 
to increase the recruitment and retention of law enforcement officers 
and staff. The recruitment and retention of law enforcement officers 
and staff for Tribal law enforcement agencies continue to face unique 
challenges. These challenges include pay parity, the length of 
background investigations, lack of applicants, and officer wellness.
    Currently, our foremost strategy is addressing pay parity by 
increasing BIA law enforcement pay levels to match with other federal 
law enforcement. To accomplish this, we completed an upgrade to our 
uniformed police officer positions during FY 2023, which increased 
career advancement opportunities, along with corresponding pay 
increases up to an additional $30,000 annually for BIA law enforcement 
officers. We are also utilizing available hiring flexibilities and 
recruitment and retention bonuses to increase current staffing levels 
and better support those interested in fulfilling the Department's 
unique mission in Tribal communities.
    On November 1, 2023, the Department released ``Not One More: 
Findings and Recommendations of the Not Invisible Act Commission'' 
report \3\ (NIAC report) in coordination with the Department of 
Justice. The Commission provided recommendations to the Secretary of 
the Interior and the Attorney General on six topic areas, including the 
recruitment and retention of Tribal and BIA law enforcement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ See: https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/
34%20NIAC%20Final%20Report_version%2011.1.23_FINAL.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To increase recruitment and retention, the Commission recommended 
that Congress make Tribal law enforcement eligible for federal 
retirement benefits. The BIA testified in several hearings in support 
of the proposed legislation to extend federal benefits to Tribal law 
enforcement. This legislation will help with Tribes' ability to recruit 
and retain law enforcement and increase the overall safety of their 
communities.
    The Department's Law Enforcement Task Force (Task Force) also 
released their 2023 report on October 27, 2023, which includes a list 
of findings and recommendations to improve all the Department's law 
enforcement programs. \4\ That list includes a finding from all Bureaus 
within the Department citing the length of time to complete background 
investigations as an impediment to filling open positions in a timely 
manner. The Task Force recommends streamlining the background 
investigation process to increase the timeliness of the hiring process.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The BIA has testified in strong support of streamlining the 
background investigation process as proposed in introduced legislation, 
specifically the Parity for Tribal Law Enforcement Act. The BIA Office 
of Justice Services assists Indian Tribes in conducting background 
investigations for Tribal law enforcement recruits and welcomes a 
demonstration program to eliminate one of the biggest obstacles to 
recruitment-the lengthy background investigation process-which would 
result in the expedited hiring of qualified law enforcement recruits. 
Currently, our team meets on a weekly basis to ensure the hiring 
process and background checks move as quickly as possible.
    In the past 20 years, Congress has commissioned several reports 
assessing the state of Tribal law enforcement and public safety, 
including through the Not Invisible Act, Savanna's Act, and the Tribal 
Law and Order Act. The Department has contributed to various reports on 
the state of Tribal law enforcement. The Department has also provided 
information for many Government Accountability Office and Congressional 
Research Service reports. Each report reaches many of the same 
conclusions, including that Tribal law enforcement needs more funding. 
Strengthening the Department's continued support of 198 federally 
recognized Tribal police forces and working toward fully funding all 
574 Tribes remains a top priority.
Jurisdiction
    The jurisdictional framework between Indian Tribes, the federal 
government, and states is complex, especially with respect to 
determining criminal jurisdiction. Congress and the courts have tied 
criminal jurisdiction to several factors to determine who exercises 
jurisdiction. These factors include type of crime, Indian or non-Indian 
status of the defendant, Indian or non-Indian status of the victim, and 
whether or not the crime scene lies within Indian Country. These 
factors impose significant transaction costs on officers, policymakers, 
attorneys, judges, and advocates working to address public safety 
challenges in Indian Country. In Indian Country, determining these 
factors is often a complex element to be resolved before beginning an 
investigation.
    However, Congress, has legislated to clarify and affirm criminal 
jurisdiction in Indian Country. These enactments include:

  <bullet> The 1968 amendments to P.L. 83-280 (P.L. 280), which 
        required states to obtain the consent of the Indian Tribe prior 
        to exercising criminal jurisdiction in Indian Country and 
        permitted states to withdraw from the jurisdictional 
        arrangement;

  <bullet> The 1991 amendments to the Indian Civil Rights Act, which 
        affirmed Indian Tribes' inherent criminal jurisdiction over 
        non-member Indians;

  <bullet> The 2010 Tribal Law and Order Act, which enhanced the 
        criminal sentencing authority of Tribal courts;

  <bullet> The 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, 
        which recognized and affirmed Indian Tribes' inherent 
        jurisdiction to prosecute non-Indians for certain crimes 
        committed in Indian Country;

  <bullet> The 2022 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, 
        which expanded and reaffirmed Indian Tribes' inherent 
        jurisdiction to prosecute non-Indians for additional crimes 
        committed in Indian Country.

    These enactments demonstrate that Indian Tribes themselves can best 
meet the public welfare and safety needs of communities within their 
jurisdiction. Despite the successful restoration of jurisdiction over 
certain crimes, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) added 
more complexities to the framework.
    In McGirt v. Oklahoma, SCOTUS held that the Muscogee Creek Nation 
continued to have criminal jurisdiction over all the land reserved for 
the Tribe in an 1866 Treaty. This decision was complicated by the 
Court's decision in Castro-Huerta v. Oklahoma. In Castro-Huerta, SCOTUS 
determined that the federal government and states have concurrent 
jurisdiction over non-Indians who commit crimes against Indians in 
Indian Country. This recognition of states' expanded jurisdiction 
occurred without the consent of sovereign federally recognized Tribes, 
and without regard to the weight of the historical understanding of the 
limits on state authority in Indian Country, which Congress has relied 
upon in enacting legislation involving Indian Country jurisdiction, 
including 18 U.S.C.  1152. These decisions combined with P.L. 280 
jurisdiction make Indian Country jurisdiction more complex, confusing, 
and ripe for unintended consequences.
    The NIAC report contained recommendations on addressing the 
jurisdictional complexities within Indian Country. These 
recommendations include (1) amending P.L. 280 to allow Tribes to opt 
out of state jurisdiction and (2) restoring jurisdiction to Tribes to 
be able to prosecute all crimes that occur on Tribal lands.
Tribal Courts
    Tribal courts are an essential aspect of Tribal sovereignty and are 
an opportunity for Tribes to run their own justice systems. There are 
approximately 400 Tribal justice systems throughout the nation. The 
focus of all these courts is to address the underlying causes of issues 
``upstream'' to prevent tragic crimes from occurring which debilitate 
Native communities. Tribes are better suited to provide best practices 
and discuss challenges with their peers.
    Many Tribes are reforming or creating judicial systems which 
incorporate traditional and cultural aspects to create a more effective 
measure to address trauma induced circumstances within their 
communities through Healing to Wellness Tribal Courts.
    Healing to Wellness courts have provided positive results in 
healing and strengthening Tribal communities. These courts address 
child dependency and family matters brought by the Tribal Social 
Service Directorate and play an essential role in family reunification 
by providing support and services needed for parents who wish to 
complete a family reunification plan. Tribes have seen an improvement 
in the reunification process when relatives and community members 
provide encouragement and support to those families needing assistance. 
Reunification is more successful through the Healing to Wellness court 
process, as is addressing addiction issues, which often go hand in hand 
with child dependency cases.
    Additional resources are needed to ensure the continued success of 
Tribal courts. The NIAC report recommended increasing funding for 
Tribal Courts for safety, equipment, and technology.
Other Resource Challenges
    Many resources are needed to help fully staff Tribal public safety 
agencies. This includes housing, updated equipment, and the improvement 
of Tribal public safety data collection.
    Housing for Tribal public safety staff is important for recruitment 
and retention. Many Tribal communities are in remote areas and law 
enforcement recruits often must relocate to those communities for their 
jobs. It is no secret that housing needs within Tribal communities are 
very high. Housing conditions vary from community to community, but 
homes are often overcrowded, lack running water and heat, and need 
replacement. These conditions combined with traveling long distances 
from home to work contribute to fatigue on Tribal law enforcement staff 
and the faster deterioration of public safety equipment.
    The Task Force report and NIAC report specified that Department law 
enforcement officers identified having updated equipment and technology 
resources as one of the top priorities needed to support their safety. 
Ensuring all Tribal officers have access to reliable, top-tier 
equipment can contribute to their safety in the field. Because many 
Tribal communities and homes are located in remote areas with unpaved 
roads, public safety vehicles accumulate greater wear and tear and need 
to be routinely replaced. Tribal law enforcement officers often respond 
to highrisk calls alone in remote areas and face greater rates of death 
in the line of duty. They heavily rely on field communications, like 
land mobile radios, to respond to calls and maintain officer safety. 
Expanded radio coverage would minimize ``no coverage'' areas, and video 
and data capabilities should be included to increase officer safety and 
reduce the stress of uncertainty regarding whether assistance will be 
available.
    Another component to ensuring Tribal law enforcement officer safety 
is access to law enforcement data systems. State and federal law 
enforcement agencies utilize their own data systems to track important 
information like warrants, missing individuals, unsolved crimes, 
evidence, and the level of danger a person charged with or convicted of 
a crime poses. These systems often do not communicate with each other 
and contribute to data gaps in Tribal communities. Tribal law 
enforcement agencies also do not always have access to these systems. 
Even if they do have access, individuals must be trained to use federal 
systems and many Tribal law enforcement agencies often do not have the 
staff to take advantage of that training. Consolidating those existing 
law enforcement systems would improve the capture of public safety 
data, and allowing Tribal law enforcement agencies to access that 
consolidated system would also ensure Tribal officer safety in the 
field.
Conclusion
    Under the historic leadership of Secretary Haaland, the Department 
and BIA continue to develop and work on meaningful solutions to assist 
Tribal law enforcement and Tribal communities. This work includes 
prioritizing and reinforcing Tribal sovereignty and self-determination 
by supporting Tribal Nations and delivering important resources to 
increase public safety in Tribal communities.
    Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and members of the 
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to provide the Department's 
views. We look forward to working with Congress to affirm and support 
Tribal sovereignty and public safety within Tribal communities. I am 
happy to answer any questions that you may have.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    Ms. Kunesh, please proceed with your testimony.

        STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICE KUNESH, COMMISSIONER, 
           ADMINISTRATION FOR NATIVE AMERICANS, U.S. 
            DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

    Ms. Kunesh. [Greeting in Native tongue.] Chairman Schatz, 
Vice Chair Murkowski, and distinguished members of the 
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today and 
to offer our thoughts on behalf of the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services. My name is Patrice Kunesh, and I am 
the Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans. I 
am also the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Native Affairs in 
the Administration for Children and Families, and I serve as 
the Chair of the HHS Intradepartmental Council on Native 
American Affairs.
    My grandfather was born in 1902 on the Fort Berthold 
Reservation in North Dakota, home of the Three Affiliated 
Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Tribes, and he grew up in Fort 
Yates on the Standing Rock Reservation. Like most Native 
American families at the time, he also was impacted by painful 
separations due to boarding schools like the Carlisle Indian 
Industrial School.
    At the time he was born, Native Americans were not 
considered citizens of the United States. It feels remarkable 
that his granddaughter is now leading a Federal agency whose 
sole mission is to support the social and economic development 
of Native people and promote tribal governance and the 
revitalization of their languages and cultures.
    HHS has been tackling these and many other issues head-on 
for some time, providing a full spectrum of integrated and 
culturally appropriate care to the Native peoples it serves. It 
is deeply engaged in providing health and human services in 
every Native community.
    For example, my agency, ANA, has long provided grant 
funding to tribes and Native organizations that support trauma-
informed services and prevention efforts, as well as culturally 
grounded programs such as Native languages, indigenous art, 
agricultural practices, tribal co-development, as well as 
workforce training. Even broader work is being done through our 
HHS partners to address consequences of violence in Indian 
Country, much of which is highlighted in the recommendations of 
the Not Invisible Act Commission, or NIAC, which lays out a 
whole-of-government response to the public safety crisis in 
Indian Country.
    I was honored to be one of three HHS commissioners on the 
NIAC, and part of the drafting team for the report and 
recommendations. It has also been a privilege to partner with 
my Federal partners here, DOI and DOJ, in the interagency ICWA 
work group to strengthen child welfare practices across the 
Country.
    ACF's work in preventing violence and human trafficking and 
supporting victims and survivors is guided by our ACF Missing 
and Murdered Indigenous Peoples Action Plan. It is supported 
also by the Office on Trafficking in Persons, which leads 
national efforts to prevent trafficking and protect survivors, 
helping them rebuild their lives and become self-sufficient.
    OTIP does this through programs such as the Victims of 
Human Trafficking in Native Communities Demonstration Program, 
and the Look Beneath the Surface campaign. For 40 years, FVPSA 
tribal grants have helped tribes deliver programs that prevent 
family violence, domestic violence, and dating violence and 
provides immediate shelter and supportive services to victims.
    Our child welfare capacity building collaborative also is 
just one of a wide range of programs and resources provided by 
ACYF to address MMIP and human trafficking prevention needs of 
Native communities. ACF also funds four hotlines that 
collectively offer access to assistance and services for those 
impacted by MMIP and survivors of human trafficking.
    In addition, the Biden-Harris Administration has advanced 
rulemaking to allow HHS and Federal partners to better 
understand the status and experiences of children and families 
in Native communities, and to remove institutional barriers 
that impede their well-being.
    Thank you for the opportunity to address the health and 
well-being and safety needs of our Native peoples throughout 
the United States. I am happy to address your questions. Wopila 
tanka.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Kunesh follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Patrice Kunesh, Commissioner, Administration 
   for Native Americans, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
Introduction
    Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and distinguished Members 
of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to join my colleagues 
from the U.S. Departments of Justice and the Interior to appear before 
you today on behalf of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS or the Department). My name is Patrice Kunesh, and I am the 
Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans (ANA). I also 
am the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Native Affairs in the 
Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and serve as the Chair 
of the HHS Intradepartmental Council on Native American Affairs.
    My grandfather was born in 1902 on the Fort Berthold Reservation in 
North Dakota, home of the Three Affiliated Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara 
Tribes, and he grew up in Fort Yates on the Standing Rock Reservation. 
Like most Native families at the time, his also was impacted by painful 
separations due to boarding schools like the Carlisle Indian Industrial 
School. Those scars lasted a lifetime, and the trauma was passed on to 
the next generations. At the time he was born, Native Americans were 
not considered citizens of the United States. This year marks the 100th 
anniversary of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, which granted him 
and other Native Americans full citizenship and paved the way for their 
voting rights. Growing up, I heard his stories about the hard life of 
the ``old days'', and it feels remarkable that his granddaughter is now 
leading a federal agency whose sole mission is to support the social 
and economic development of Native people and promote Tribal governance 
and the revitalization of their languages and cultures.
    I first learned about the ANA as a law student and then a staff 
attorney at the Native American Rights Fund (NARF). My first assignment 
at NARF was to review the procedural protections of the Indian Child 
Welfare Act (ICWA) of 1978 and assess the gaps in state court 
proceedings and options for Tribes to strengthen their programs to 
rebuild the bonds of families. This extensive, multi-year project was 
supported by ANA funding. ANA was established by the Native American 
Programs Act of 1974, so we have cause to celebrate another significant 
milestone--ANA's 50th anniversary--and reflect on ANA's legacy of 
impactful investments in Native people and communities for five 
decades.
    I am pleased to have the opportunity to share some of HHS's efforts 
to promote public safety and the well-being of American Indian, Alaska 
Native, and Native Hawaiian people and communities. My testimony will 
focus on the human and social service supports provided by HHS in 
addressing two of the most dire public safety crises in Indian 
Country--missing and murdered Indigenous peoples (MMIP) and human 
trafficking.
    Research indicates that Native people have long experienced 
violence and crime victimization at exceptionally higher rates than 
non-Native people. This chronic exposure to violence originates in 
large part from the federal government's inhumane reservation and 
boarding school policies aimed at separating Native people from their 
land and cultures and Native families from their children. While Native 
communities have inherent strengths to cope with such generational 
trauma, mainly through language and cultural lifeways, generations of 
hostility and loss have left a legacy of broken systems of care and 
poor health outcomes.
    The Department is the federal agency responsible for enhancing 
social and human services at the state and Tribal levels, and for 
protecting the welfare of children and families. Thus, HHS holds a 
critical role in the federal government's collective responsibility to 
address this legacy and to mend the wounds of generations of trauma and 
violence against Native people. The Department is committed to honoring 
our Nation's obligations to support the health and well-being of Native 
people and to enhancing our coordination of these services and 
responses with our federal partners. In doing so, we also recognize the 
responsibility to elevate the capacity of Tribal governments and 
recognize their essential roles in delivering programs and making 
decisions about their use of funding and resources.
HHS Partnership and Federal Coordination
    HHS provides a full spectrum of integrated and culturally 
appropriate care to the Native peoples it serves. From the front-line 
health and triage care provided by the Indian Health Service to the 
mental and behavioral health services and supports provided by the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), as 
well as the trauma-informed care provided by ACF, HHS is deeply engaged 
in providing health and human services in every Native community.
    Much of what is being done within HHS to address the consequences 
of violence in Indian Country is highlighted in the recommendations of 
the Not Invisible Act Commission (NIAC), which lays out a whole-of-
government response to the public safety crisis in Indian Country. I 
was honored to be one of the three NIAC commissioners for HHS and part 
of the drafting team for the report and recommendations. The NIAC 
Commissioners seek real action and substantial investments in public 
safety and social and human services to prevent further harm and 
distress to Native people and then to catalyze the healing of whole 
families and communities. In addition, as Chair of the 
Interdepartmental Council on Native American Affairs, I am leading 
HHS's response to the NIAC Report. We anticipate submitting HHS 
specific responses to supplement the March 5, 2024 submitted NIAC 
Report in the coming weeks.
    The Commissioner of the Administration for Children Youth and 
Families (ACYF), which oversees the Children's Bureau, and I also are 
extensively engaged in the interdepartmental ICWA Interagency Work 
Group, along with principals from the Departments of the Interior and 
Justice. The ICWA Work Group meets regularly to address interagency 
issues such as data interoperability, Tribal representation and 
capacity building, and regulatory changes. For instance, we recently 
met to review The Way Forward Report of the Alyce Spotted Bear & Walter 
Soboleff Commission on Native Children and discuss how each of our 
agencies can implement its recommendations.
    HHS has been tackling these issues head-on for some time. Our 
approach can generally be described as providing services and grant 
funding specifically related to the prevention, intervention, and 
healing of all forms of trauma and violence to Native people. HHS has a 
strong track record in Indian Country funding programs and services to 
address behavioral health and substance use, as well as shelters and 
emergency and temporary housing, community supports for Tribal 
governments, and valuable data collection services. The ANA, for 
example, has long provided grant funding to Tribes and Native 
organizations that support trauma-informed services to victims of 
violence, including combat veterans, and culturally grounded programs 
such as Native languages, Indigenous art and agriculture ecologies, 
peer counsellors, Tribal code development, as well as work force 
training. Some of the most important work we are doing in ANA is 
helping to preserve and revitalize Native languages, which is central 
to Native identity and cultural ways of life, and integral to healing 
and resilience.
    Even broader work is being done through our HHS partners. In the 
area of behavioral health in Native communities, for instance, SAMHSA 
has promoted Project AWARE (Advancing Wellness and Resiliency in 
Education). This program provides treatment, support, and recovery 
services to survivors of violence by funding four Tribal-only grant 
programs that aim to address mental health and substance use disorders 
and crisis response in Tribal communities. In addition, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, recognizing the importance of accurate 
data on Native Americans to understand the scope of the crisis of 
murdered, missing, and trafficked persons, conducts the National 
Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS). This survey 
collects the most current and comprehensive national and state-level 
data on intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and stalking 
victimization in the United States. The data inform both intervention 
strategies and prevention efforts. These are just some of the ways HHS 
is working to positively impact the health and well-being in Native 
communities.
ACF Actions to Address MMIP and Human Trafficking in Native 
        Communities
    ACF is especially committed to preventing violence and human 
trafficking and ensuring that victims and survivors of all forms of 
violence have access to meaningful services and supports across the 
country, including in Native communities. This work is closely informed 
by both Tribal leaders through our Tribal Advisor Committee and the 
Native communities we serve.
    We know that the MMIP and human trafficking epidemics encompass a 
wide scope of crimes, including domestic violence. ACF's work in this 
area is guided by the ACF MMIP Action Plan, which identifies specific 
ways to leverage ACF's grant funding, community engagement, and 
rulemaking authority to expand and create more flexibility in funding 
programs and services to Tribes and Native communities. For example, 
ACF recently recommended, and the Department of the Interior approved, 
Tribes to integrate ACF's Family Violence Prevention and Services Act 
(FVPSA) programs related to the Public Law 102-477, the Indian 
Employment, Training, and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 
(477 Program))TribalTribal. The integration of this and other ACF 
programs not only enhances funding by streamlining service delivery and 
also empowers Tribes to address their particular needs in the most 
culturally appropriate ways.
    Our research and experiences here tell us two things: 1) the most 
successful and long-lasting work is community-driven, especially in 
Indian Country; and 2) culture is prevention-the evidence shows that 
culture is a protective social determinant of health for Native people. 
One of ACF's most engaged programs in this area is the Office on 
Trafficking in Persons, OTIP, which supports and leads systems that 
prevent trafficking and protect survivors, helping them rebuild their 
lives and become self-sufficient. OTIP serves Native communities in 
several ways:

  <bullet> The Victims of Human Trafficking in Native Communities 
        Demonstration Program, providing funding to organizations such 
        as the Alaska Native Justice Center (Anchorage, Alaska), Child 
        and Family Service (Ewa Beach, Hawaii), and the YMCA of the 
        North (Minneapolis, Minnesota), to build, expand, and sustain 
        community and organizational capacity to provide services to 
        Native peoples who have experienced human trafficking.

  <bullet> The Look Beneath the Surface Campaign raises public 
        awareness about human trafficking and the factors that make 
        certain communities more at risk.

  <bullet> OTIP and ANA are holding a listening session on Native 
        Children Missing from Care, both virtual and in-person, to 
        better understand the definition of a ``missing'' child, gaps 
        in government responses and resources, and services needed for 
        the children and youth in these situations. Specifically, this 
        OTIP and ANA joint listening session will hear directly from 
        stakeholders and partners across the country about their lived 
        experiences so we can develop strategies to intervene and 
        prevent further tragedy.

    In addition, ACF's Office of Family Violence Prevention Services 
(OFVPS) administers FVPSA programs. For 40 years, FPVSA Tribal grants 
have helped Tribes deliver programs that prevent family violence, 
domestic violence, and dating violence, and provide immediate shelter 
and supportive services. I accompanied OFVPS' Tribal team in their 
visit to one of these programs on the Standing Rock Reservation in 
South Dakota, my mother's community, and was quite impressed by the 
extensive services it provides to community members from both North and 
South Dakota and the adjoining Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation. The 
FVPSA-funded programs screen for and identify survivors of human 
trafficking, survivors of domestic violence, and those who have 
experienced dating violence. Appropriate services are provided to 
support their unique needs, including temporary housing and child care.
    Further, in fiscal year (FY) 2023, OFVPS awarded $7.5 million of 
FVPSA funding to support 35 cooperative agreements--such as with the 
Pacific Community of Alaska, the Nevada Urban Indians, Inc., and the 
South Dakota Network Against Family Violence and Sexual Assault. These 
agreements support Culturally Specific Domestic Violence and Sexual 
Assault grants for Native-serving organizations to build and sustain 
their organizational capacity in delivering trauma-informed, 
developmentally sensitive, culturally relevant services for children, 
individuals, and families affected by sexual assault, domestic 
violence, and other traumas. In addition to these awards, OFVPS 
supports the StrongHearts Native Helpline. This service offers support 
to Native survivors of domestic violence and dating violence, including 
peer support, crisis intervention, personalized safety planning, and 
referrals for Tribal and Native-centered supportive services to 
callers. StrongHearts also maintains a Native-specific referral 
database of over 318 Native-centered direct service providers.
    ACF's ACYF also provides a wide range of programs and resources to 
address the MMIP and human trafficking prevention needs of Native 
communities. For example, ACYF's Children's Bureau (CB) funds the Child 
Welfare Capacity Building Collaborative (Collaborative), a partnership 
among the Center for States, the Center for Tribes, and the Center for 
Courts. The Collaborative provides tailored technical assistance to 
jurisdictions that request assistance and resource supports to peer 
groups on Preventing and Addressing Sex Trafficking. One of these 
groups, the Preventing and Addressing Human Trafficking in Child 
Welfare Peer Group, promotes collaboration among child welfare 
professionals responsible for coordinating the response to human 
trafficking and the multidisciplinary partners they work with, 
including law enforcement, courts, and service providers. In addition, 
CB's Capacity Building Collaborative and Regional Offices support 
Tribal child welfare programs, provide grants to strengthen Tribal 
courts' capacity to oversee child welfare cases, and funding to 
strengthen State-Tribal partnerships that promote best practices in 
Indian child welfare proceedings. Further, Tribes can request technical 
assistance specifically for issues around sex trafficking from CB's 
Capacity Building Center for Tribes.
    Finally, in addition to the StrongHearts Native Hotline, ACF funds 
three other hotlines that collectively offer access to assistance and 
services for MMIP and survivors of human trafficking. These include: 
(1) the National Human Trafficking Hotline, a 24/7, confidential, 
multilingual resource that provides information and service referrals 
for people at risk for, currently experiencing, or who have experienced 
human trafficking; (2) The 24/7 National Runaway Safeline, which 
operates the National Communication System for Runaway and Homeless 
Youth program; and (3) The 24/7 National Domestic Violence Hotline, 
which provides information and assistance to victims, advocates, 
government officials, law enforcement agencies, and the public.
Regulatory Action
    Investing in Native communities by providing them the services and 
supports they need to improve their health and well-being is a high 
priority for HHS. In addition to the efforts and programs mentioned 
above, recent regulatory actions by the Biden-Harris Administration 
will advance this priority by allowing HHS and our federal partners to 
better understand the status and experiences of children and families 
in Native communities and removing institutional barriers that impede 
their well-being.
Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System--Indian Child 
        Welfare Act
    As noted above, information systems are integral to intervention 
and prevention strategies. ACF has one of the most robust data systems 
for collecting and assessing encounters in the child welfare system, 
which is also crucial to reducing family separation where possible. One 
such tool is the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System 
(AFCARS), the data from which are used for a variety of requirements, 
including providing national statistics on the child welfare population 
and sex trafficking data.
    On February 28, 2024, HHS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking 
that would require state title IV-E agencies to report additional 
information related to ICWA procedural requirements. This additional 
AFCARS information would help HHS, researchers, and policymakers better 
understand the status and experiences of American Indian and Alaskan 
Native children and families interacting with the state child welfare 
systems and better address their continuing overrepresentation in 
foster care and other poor outcomes. Further, the proposed additional 
data collection would enable HHS, other Federal agencies, states, and 
Tribes to target policy development, training, and technical assistance 
to specific areas of need to mitigate disproportionality for American 
Indian and Alaskan Native children and families, support pathways to 
timely permanency for these children, and help maintain the integrity 
of families and communities.
Kinship Final Rule
    ACF believes that families belong together, and we aim to 
strengthen and rebuild the bonds of Native families. Today, millions of 
children across the country are cared for primarily by their 
grandparents, aunts and uncles, and other relatives, who provide a safe 
and loving home when parents are unable to do so. Research shows the 
benefits of keeping children with their own relatives when parents are 
unable to take care of them, highlighting the importance of close 
family and community connections, preservation of cultural identity, 
and enhanced placement stability when compared to non-relatives. 
However, despite ICWA protections, Native children are overrepresented 
in state foster care at a rate almost three times greater than their 
proportion in the general population. Nearly every Native family in the 
United States has been deeply affected by government-induced family 
separation. Removing Native children from their families has become 
normalized and systemic--it is done bureaucratically through child 
welfare systems, court proceedings, and social services.
    On September 27, 2023, HHS issued a final regulation that allows 
states to remove barriers to kin caregivers by creating separate 
licensing standards for kin caregivers. Importantly, this includes 
recognizing Native kinship care and Tribal government kinship care 
licensing procedures. Under this rule, family care providers may become 
licensed foster care providers and receive full financial support from 
the state. Previously, all foster homes needed to meet the same 
licensing standards, regardless of whether the caregiver was family. 
While all kin caregivers will continue to be subject to criminal 
background checks, states can now create a more straightforward path to 
financially supporting kinship care. Each state will determine how to 
operationalize this opportunity. To date, CB has already approved five 
states and two Tribes to operate licensing standards designed for 
relative providers, and plans submitted by three additional 
jurisdictions are under review.
Increasing Investment
    The President's FY 2025 Budget supports the Department's mission to 
promote the health and well-being of all Americans. This budget 
outlines increases in Indian Country for the Indian Health Service and 
specifically for Public Safety, for Opioid and Substance Use ($21 
million), and Maternal Health ($7 million). In addition, the 
President's FY 2025 budget offers a historic opportunity for ACF 
programs to enhance how we support human service delivery to children, 
families, and communities across the country. The budget reflects our 
nation-to-nation commitment to Tribes with a request of $66 million for 
Native American Programs, which is a $5 million increase for Native 
American Language Programs. In addition to supporting up to 20 new 
grant awards, the increase includes $2 million to support a survey on 
the use of Native American languages in the United States, as required 
by the Durbin Feeling Native American Languages Act of 2022. The budget 
also includes a legislative proposal to provide Tribes the authority to 
create Tribally determined, culturally informed, high-quality early 
childhood services for young children and their families.
Conclusion
    Thank you again for the opportunity to address this Committee on 
the health, well-being, and safety of Native people throughout the 
United States. I appreciate the Committee's attention to this vitally 
important issue. Please let me know if you have any questions. Wopila 
tanka.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    Ms. Randall, please proceed with your testimony.

        STATEMENT OF ALLISON RANDALL, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY 
       DIRECTOR, OFFICE ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, U.S. 
                     DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

    Ms. Randall. Thank you, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman 
Murkowski, and members of the Committee for inviting me to 
speak about public safety and justice resources in Native 
communities.
    Combatting domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking and 
sex trafficking by implementing the Violence Against Women Act 
and the recommendations of the Not Invisible Act Commission are 
essential to improve public safety and reduce violent crime. 
That is not just because the rates of these crimes are 
staggering and disproportionate, though they are; it is also 
because reducing these crimes reduces other types of crimes. 
People who use violence in their communities use violence at 
home. Addressing the crimes of domestic and sexual violence can 
stop those perpetrators from committing other types of 
violence.
    This is just one crucial reason why recognizing tribes' 
inherent authority over non-Indian perpetrators of an expanded 
set of crimes was so important. I want to thank the Committee 
for your work to make that happen.
    Thanks to VAWA 2022, tribes can prosecute more crimes of 
domestic violence as well as sexual violence, stalking, sex 
trafficking, and more. They can hold perpetrators accountable 
before there is a murder, before someone goes missing. 
Accountability is prevention. There are now at least 32 tribes 
exercising some type of STCJ, with 12 exercising jurisdiction 
over the expanded set of crimes. Just last week, we announced 
funding for 14 tribes under our new VAWA program to reimburse 
expenses incurred in exercising special tribal criminal 
jurisdiction, and the President's budget request more than 
doubled last year's funding for that STCJ grant and 
reimbursement program.
    Two other crucial initiatives have been creating a 
framework for the pilot program for Alaska Native villages to 
exercise STCJ and providing dedicated funding for any Alaska 
tribe to undertake activities, updating codes or hiring 
prosecutors that they would need to have in place to exercise 
STCJ.
    I just returned from that convening in Fairbanks, and with 
a boost from Senator Murkowski, we had an overflowing crowd. I 
expect more Alaska tribes to take advantage of DOJ support this 
year. That support is desperately needed.
    At OVW's annual tribal consultation in 2022, Gloria George 
and her colleagues from the Asa'carsarmiut tribe testified 
about the horrific abuse they had experienced and the need for 
law enforcement, housing, broadband internet, and flexible 
funding. Gloria ended by saying, you know, we are here with so 
much hope, all of us, hoping that we make a change. When you 
all go back to Washington, you carry all of our hopes back with 
you.
    Then we learned that shortly before she spoke, her niece 
had been founded murdered. But still Gloria entrusted us with 
her hope.
    As a Not Invisible Act commissioner, I am proud to say that 
DOJ is actively working to address this crisis and respond to 
every NIAC recommendation within our statutory authority. We 
are launching the Healing and Response Teams initiative, 
funding more tribal special assistant U.S. attorneys, allowing 
victims of Crime Act funding to support families and search 
efforts for missing persons.
    And I have to say, making it easier to get and then manage 
Federal funding was one of the most frequent committees on the 
NIAC committees on which I served. All three DOJ grant 
components are prioritizing this. We are making progress.
    The Knik tribe recently told me that one of our streamlined 
applications was so much simpler that for the first time, they 
had been able to submit a complete application for an OVW 
grant. But there is so much more that needs to be done. DOJ 
leadership and staff are committed to making that happen.
    Our acting associate attorney general is in New Mexico 
today meeting with the Pueblo of Acoma. I do a lot of site 
visits to see first-hand what is happening on the ground in 
tribal and Native Hawaiian communities, and to build trust. I 
have promised that we would keep coming back, and we are. We 
have even hired staff based across Indian Country and Alaska.
    DOJ knows that the best solutions to public safety 
challenges come from the communities and the survivors we 
serve. So we will keep listening and keep asking to be held 
accountable for our efforts to improve. We will take that hope 
we were entrusted with and turn it into action.
    Thank you, and I welcome the opportunity to answer your 
questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Randall follows:]

   Prepared Statement of Allison Randall, Principal Deputy Director, 
      Office on Violence Against Women, U.S. Department of Justice
    Thank you, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and members of 
the Committee for inviting me here to speak with you today regarding 
implementation of the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 
2022 (VAWA 2022) and the Department of Justice's (the Department or 
DOJ) response, in coordination with the Department of the Interior, to 
the recommendations of the Not Invisible Act Commission. It was an 
honor for me to serve on that Commission alongside Tribal leaders, 
survivors, family members of victims, federal partners, law 
enforcement, and service providers, and I am grateful to Department 
leadership, including our Office of Tribal Justice, for their 
commitment to addressing the crisis of missing or murdered Indigenous 
persons and human trafficking.
    As Principal Deputy Director for the Department's Office on 
Violence Against Women (OVW), I am dedicated to carrying out the 
mandates of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and its 
reauthorizations, which include carefully crafted provisions designed 
to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, 
and sex trafficking in Tribal and Indigenous communities. OVW 
administers financial and technical assistance to communities across 
the country working to prevent and respond to these crimes and improve 
support for victims/survivors, including Tribes, Tribal organizations, 
and Native Hawaiian and other culturally specific communities. 
Advancing Tribal sovereignty, increasing public safety in Indian 
country, Alaska Native Villages, and Native Hawaiian communities, and 
supporting community-driven solutions that respond to the unique 
history of Hawai`i are all of great importance to the Department and 
OVW. OVW recognizes the diverse strengths and challenges of the 
differently situated Tribes, including those in Alaska, and Native 
Hawaiian communities.
    This work cannot be done without partnerships with American Indian, 
Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and other Indigenous communities. OVW 
consults with Tribes formally once per year--through its Annual 
Government-to-Government Violence Against Women Tribal Consultation--
and informally throughout the year to obtain feedback and specific 
recommendations as to how OVW's Tribal Affairs Division (TAD) can best 
support current and potential Tribal grantees in obtaining and 
administering grant funding. OVW consults informally with Native 
Hawaiian communities through outreach, meetings, and site visits. In 
the last six weeks, I have traveled to both Hawai`i and Alaska, as well 
as all three Pacific Territories; in addition I have made multiple 
prior trips to Indian country and Alaska and to meet with Urban Indian 
Organizations.
    In addition to increased engagement, we have strengthened our staff 
support for American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and other 
Indigenous communities. OVW's TAD is an integral part of OVW's work in 
responding to the sometimes rapidly evolving needs of different Tribal 
communities. TAD is led by Sherriann Moore, Rosebud Sicangu' Lakota, 
who serves as OVW's Deputy Director for Tribal Affairs and coordinates 
OVW's annual Tribal consultation. In recent years, TAD has experienced 
tremendous growth: OVW heard from Tribal leaders and advocates that 
they needed more support from OVW staff and, as a result, TAD has more 
than doubled its staffing to 14 staff members, many of whom are located 
in Tribal communities and have extensive experience working with 
Tribes. In addition, we have hired a Senior Policy Advisor on 
Culturally Specific Communities (a position created by VAWA 2022) and 
increased staffing for our culturally specific grant programs.
VAWA 2022
    Congress has responded to the shocking rates of violence against 
American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) women by strengthening VAWA 
and recognizing the impact of historical trauma in Tribal and 
Indigenous communities. In 2021, the rate of homicide involving AI/AN 
victims was nearly four times higher than the rate of homicides 
involving non-Hispanic white victims. \1\ In Alaska the previous year, 
the homicide rate was nearly 10 times higher for AI/AN populations than 
it was for whites. \2\ According to data from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, from 2003 to 2018, 45 percent of homicides of 
female AI/AN victims involved intimate partner violence, similar to 
women of other racial/ethnic groups. \3\ According to the National 
Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, more than two in five 
(non-Hispanic) AI/AN (43.7 percent) women were raped in their lifetime 
\4\ and more than half (57.7 percent) of (non-Hispanic) AI/AN women 
reported experiencing intimate partner violence (contact sexual 
violence, physical violence, and stalking). \5\ In an examination of 
data regarding violence against AI/AN men and women, the National 
Institute of Justice reported that AI/AN peoples were significantly 
more likely to have experienced violence by a perpetrator of a 
different race at least once in their lifetimes. \6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In VAWA 2022, Congress--with leadership from members of this 
Committee--sought to address the deeply disturbing lifetime incidence 
of violence experienced by AI/AN people by recognizing Tribal criminal 
jurisdiction over non-Indian offenders who commit an expanded set of 
covered crimes (known as Special Tribal Criminal Jurisdiction or STCJ) 
and updating and expanding other crucial Tribal provisions. The 
Department has been working diligently to implement these provisions, 
including by creating a framework for the Alaska Pilot Program--a 
multifaceted initiative addressing public safety needs in Alaska Native 
communities by supporting Alaska Native Villages interested in pursuing 
designation by the Attorney General to exercise STCJ. The Alaska Pilot 
Program, while still in its early stages, represents a collaboration 
across multiple DOJ components, including OVW, to develop a structure, 
process, and procedures for interested Alaska Tribes that are 
responsive to Tribal feedback and Tribes' understandable desire to 
exercise autonomy over the public safety needs of their Villages. The 
Department hopes that, through its implementation, this Pilot Program 
will provide Alaska Native Villages with much needed access to funding 
opportunities, training, and other forms of criminal justice capacity 
building.
    In addition, since VAWA 2022's enactment, OVW has rolled out a 
newly authorized program to reimburse Tribes nationwide for expenses 
incurred in exercising STCJ. The President's FY 2025 Budget, which 
requests a $14 million increase for grants to support expanded Tribal 
criminal jurisdiction (including funding for Tribes in Alaska) and the 
Tribal Reimbursement Program, reflects the Administration's steadfast 
commitment to supporting the sovereign authority of Tribes to address 
public safety in their communities.
    While these activities have been our main focus, OVW also has been 
deeply engaged in finding new and creative ways to improve Tribes' 
access to and administration of grant funds by making Tribal grant 
applications and progress reports simpler, reducing documentation 
requirements, holding regional workshops across the country (including 
in Alaska) and office hours with Tribal grantees and potential 
grantees, and extending the duration of grant awards. OVW takes 
seriously the directive in Executive Order 14112, Reforming Federal 
Funding and Support for Tribal Nations to Better Embrace Our Trust 
Responsibilities and Promote the Next Era of Tribal Self-Determination, 
to reform our grant processes wherever possible to better live up to 
the federal government's trust responsibilities and support for Tribal 
self-determination. We have a mandate from this Committee and Congress 
as a whole to maximize flexibility for Tribes, incorporate the voices 
of AI/AN and Native Hawaiian survivors, and preserve and protect the 
VAWA dollars allocated specifically for Tribes' sovereign responses to 
domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and sex 
trafficking in their communities.
    Furthering our commitment to supporting Native communities, OVW is 
also engaged in targeted outreach to Native Hawaiian organizations to 
increase awareness of available OVW grants and facilitate their access 
to funding. This effort includes implementing the VAWA Technical 
Amendment Act of 2022, enacted in December 2022, which broadened 
eligibility under OVW's Tribal Coalitions Program to include certain 
Native Hawaiian organizations. OVW is working to identify Native 
Hawaiian organizations, as well as advocates from Native Hawaiian 
communities, who can potentially form a coalition and apply for Tribal 
Coalitions Program funding. At the same time, OVW has set aside the 
first-ever training and technical assistance funding that will support 
capacity- and coalition-building among victim service organizations, 
advocates, and allied professionals serving Native Hawaiian and Pacific 
Islander survivors.
Implementation of Special Tribal Criminal Jurisdiction
    The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA 2013), 
codified at 25 U.S.C.  1304, sought to address a critical public 
safety gap by recognizing the inherent authority of participating 
federally recognized Tribes to exercise ``Special Domestic Violence 
Criminal Jurisdiction'' (SDVCJ) over non-Indian offenders who commit 
certain domestic and dating violence crimes against Indian victims in 
Indian country. VAWA 2013 also identified the rights that participating 
Tribes must provide to defendants in SDVCJ cases. The Department 
launched a statutorily mandated pilot project, under which five Tribes 
implemented the jurisdiction on an accelerated basis, and created an 
Inter-Tribal Technical Assistance Working Group (ITWG) for Tribes to 
share strategies, resources, viewpoints, concerns, and questions with 
other Tribes planning to exercise the jurisdiction. This group has 
continued to convene in-person twice a year since its inception, as 
well as holding monthly virtual meetings. OVW has supported its work 
through technical assistance funding since 2014.
    After the end of the pilot period, an additional 26 Tribes reported 
implementing SDVCJ. A March 2018 report published by the National 
Congress of American Indians, VAWA 2013's Special Domestic Violence 
Criminal Jurisdiction (SDVCJ) Five-Year Report, documented the 
successes and gaps in SDVCJ implementation. \9\ Successes included 
convictions of defendants with documented histories of violent 
behavior, along with acquittals and only one habeas petition--
testaments to Tribes' ability to safeguard the rights of defendants. 
Gaps included crimes that could not be prosecuted, such as child abuse, 
sexual assault, and stalking, and barriers to implementing the 
jurisdiction in Alaska.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ The report is available at https://www.ncai.org/resources/ncai-
publications/SDVCJ_5_Year_Report.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In VAWA 2022, Congress extended its recognition of the inherent 
authority of Tribes to exercise jurisdiction over non-Indian offenders, 
which it re-named Special Tribal Criminal Jurisdiction (STCJ). STCJ 
expands the list of covered crimes that Tribes can prosecute to include 
sexual violence, stalking, sex trafficking, child violence, assault of 
Tribal justice personnel, and obstruction of justice, with these last 
two crimes not requiring that the victim be an Indian. VAWA 2022 also 
removed the VAWA 2013 requirement that non-Indian offenders have 
substantial ties to the Tribe exercising jurisdiction.
    OVW moved quickly after enactment of VAWA 2022 to compete and issue 
a new technical assistance award to the Tribal Law and Policy Institute 
to continue to support the ITWG and to expand its focus to address the 
VAWA 2022 changes to STCJ. OVW also made adjustments to its grant 
program supporting implementation of VAWA 2013's Tribal jurisdiction 
provision to allow existing and new grantees to use grant funds to 
prepare for and exercise STCJ under VAWA 2022.
Implementation of the Alaska Tribal Public Safety Empowerment Act
    The Alaska Tribal Public Safety Empowerment Act, which is a 
subtitle of VAWA 2022's Tribal title, also created a pathway for 
federally recognized Tribes in Alaska to begin exercising jurisdiction 
over non-Natives for covered crimes. First, the Act recognized and 
affirmed the inherent authority of any Indian Tribe occupying a Village 
in Alaska to exercise criminal and civil jurisdiction over all Indians 
present in the Village (which is defined to mean the Alaska Native 
Village Statistical Area covering all or any portion of a Native 
village, as depicted on Census Bureau's applicable Tribal Statistical 
Area Program Verification map \10\ ). 25 U.S.C.  1305(a). Second, it 
recognized the authority of Tribal courts in Alaska to exercise full 
civil jurisdiction to issue and enforce protection orders involving any 
person in matters arising within the Tribe's Village or otherwise 
within the Tribe's authority. Id.  1305(b). And third, it established 
a pilot program under which the Attorney General designates up to five 
Alaska Tribes per calendar year as participating Tribes to exercise 
STCJ over all persons present in their Villages. Id.  1305(d). The 
Alaska Tribal Public Safety Empowerment Act directed the Attorney 
General, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and 
affected Tribes, to establish a process to designate participating 
Tribes, including (1) a preference for Tribes whose Villages have 
predominantly Indian populations and lack permanent State law 
enforcement presence, and (2) a requirement that the Attorney General 
determine that a Tribe has adequate safeguards to protect defendants' 
rights--similar to the mandate of the VAWA 2013 pilot project. Per 
statute, not more than five Tribes can be designated per calendar year 
and, at most, 30 Tribes can be designated in total--possibly more with 
Congressional notification.

    \10\ VAWA 2022  812(7), Pub. L. No. 117-103, div. W, 136 Stat. 
840, 905-06 (codified at 25 U.S.C.  1305 note).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Department held consultations with Tribal leaders throughout 
summer and fall of 2022, at which Tribes recommended that the Pilot 
Program include processes for Alaska Tribes not ready to exercise STCJ, 
that DOJ support Alaska-specific technical assistance, and that federal 
agencies coordinate with Alaska Tribes and each other to ensure 
consistent, sustained funding for the infrastructure required to 
exercise the jurisdiction. Department leadership convened a working 
group of DOJ components with relevant expertise to develop a proposed 
framework reflecting these recommendations, on which we sought further 
Tribal input at OVW's annual consultation last August and which the 
Attorney General and other DOJ officials discussed with Alaska Native 
leaders and representatives at an August 2023 roundtable in Anchorage, 
Alaska. Accordingly, DOJ created a flexible and inclusive three-track 
system for Alaska Native Villages in different stages of readiness to 
exercise STCJ, which then-Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta 
announced at the annual meeting of the Alaska Federation of Natives in 
October 2023. The three-track process is intended to identify gaps in 
criminal justice infrastructure that may prevent a Tribe from receiving 
designation and address those gaps with training and technical 
assistance, peer-to-peer support, and information about funding 
opportunities.
    As requested by Tribal leaders during consultations, DOJ also 
created an Alaska-specific Inter-Tribal Technical Assistance Working 
Group (Alaska ITWG) to facilitate the delivery of technical assistance, 
provide peer-to-peer support, and encourage the sharing of information 
among interested Alaska Native Villages. OVW is supporting the Alaska 
ITWG through a technical assistance award to the Alaska Native Justice 
Center, which is partnering in this project with the Rural Alaska 
Community Action Program, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the 
Alaska Native Women's Resource Center, the Tanana Chiefs Conference, 
and the Association of Village Council Presidents. The first Alaska 
ITWG meeting, which I attended, took place on May 9-10, 2024, in 
Fairbanks, Alaska, and was open to all Alaska Native Tribes as a way to 
learn more about STCJ, the Pilot Program tracks, and available funding, 
training, and technical assistance. There were 110 registered attendees 
and 95 of them represented Alaska Tribes, Tribal coalitions, and other 
Tribal organizations.
    The Alaska ITWG is the crucial first step of the three-track 
process. Track One invites Tribes to join the Alaska ITWG and does not 
require any demonstration of capacity or readiness to exercise STCJ. In 
Track Two, the Preliminary Pilot Program Tribes complete a 
questionnaire that closely follows the statutory requirements to 
exercise STCJ and are assigned a Federal Liaison who--along with the 
Alaska STCJ Technical Assistance Provider--works with the Tribe to 
assess their areas of need, investigate potential resources to meet 
those needs, and create a Readiness Plan. In Track Three, a Federal 
Review Team comprised of DOJ experts reviews a Tribe's final 
questionnaire and recommends either (a) Attorney General designation as 
a Participating Pilot Program Tribe, (b) maintaining the Tribe's status 
as a Preliminary Pilot Program Tribe (if applicable), or (c) inviting 
the Tribe to become a Preliminary Pilot Program Tribe.
    In addition to supporting the Department's efforts to launch the 
Alaska Pilot Program, OVW issued a special solicitation in FY 2023 to 
provide funding under its Tribal Jurisdiction Grant Program to Alaska 
Tribes interested in preparing to seek Attorney General designation to 
exercise STCJ. Two Tribes, the Village of Dot Lake and Chickaloon 
Native Village, received five-year awards of $1.5 million each in 
September 2023 under this solicitation. OVW plans to issue another $3 
million to Alaska Tribes under this initiative in FY 2024.
    Last summer, the Department also heard from Tribal leaders in 
Alaska who asked us to clarify the provision in VAWA 2022 confirming 
that Alaska Tribes have inherent authority to exercise both civil and 
criminal jurisdiction over ``all Indians present in [their Villages].'' 
In response, in October 2023, the Department's Office of Tribal Justice 
issued a memorandum reaffirming VAWA 2022's statement and describing 
the settled legal precedent that Alaska Native Tribes retain inherent 
criminal jurisdiction over Indians in their Villages.
STCJ Tribal Reimbursement Program
    Prior to the 2022 reauthorization of VAWA, Tribal leaders and 
officials identified costs, including unplanned costs, as one of the 
most serious obstacles that Tribes face in exercising criminal 
jurisdiction over non-Indian offenders. In response, VAWA 2022 created 
the Tribal Reimbursement Program, which will reimburse Tribes for 
expenses incurred in exercising STCJ. Under the Tribal Reimbursement 
Program, eligible expenses for reimbursement include expenses and costs 
associated with investigating, making arrests, or prosecuting covered 
crimes; detaining, providing supervision of, or providing services for 
offenders (including costs associated with providing health care); 
providing indigent defense services; and incarcerating, supervising, or 
providing treatment, rehabilitation, or reentry services for offenders.
    VAWA 2022 required that the Attorney General issue regulations 
governing the Tribal Reimbursement Program, including setting a maximum 
annual reimbursement amount per Tribe and establishing a process and 
conditions for waivers of the maximum amount. OVW issued an interim 
final rule on April 11, 2023, after extensive consultation with Tribal 
leaders and listening sessions with Tribal experts, as well as meetings 
with other federal agencies that manage reimbursement programs. 
Following issuance of the rule, OVW collaborated with our Tribal 
technical assistance providers and the ITWG to educate Tribes about how 
the new program would operate and to urge implementing Tribes to 
participate.
    In selecting a structure for the program, OVW considered Tribes' 
recommendations that the reimbursement process ensure (1) a 
predictable, stable source of funding, (2) a fair share of available 
funds for each Tribe, and (3) access to reimbursement funds early in a 
calendar year because some Tribes lack adequate resources to front the 
expenses of exercising STCJ. OVW also considered Tribal requests that 
the reimbursement rules be flexible and impose few administrative 
burdens. Based on this feedback, the interim final rule provides that 
each Tribe requesting reimbursement will receive, as an initial 
allocation, the same dollar amount for the maximum allowable 
reimbursement (except that the amount may not exceed the amount the 
Tribe expended the previous year in exercising STCJ). The maximum 
allowable reimbursement serves as a form of ``base funding,'' where 
each Tribe will have access to this amount early in the calendar year 
and can draw it down as expenses are incurred. At the end of the 
calendar year, Tribes may submit a waiver request seeking the actual 
amounts expended on exercise of STCJ during the calendar year. Each 
Tribe will receive the same percentage of their total actual expenses 
in excess of the maximum allowable reimbursement. This process will 
ensure that, if appropriations cannot cover Tribal expenditures on 
STCJ, remaining available funding will be equitably distributed at the 
end of the year.
    OVW issued the first Notice of Reimbursement Opportunity for the 
Tribal Reimbursement Program in December 2023, and made 14 
reimbursement awards totaling $559,825 in mid-May 2024. OVW has 
approximately $3,140,175 remaining to respond to Tribes' waiver 
requests at the end of the year based on their actual expenses for 
calendar year 2024.
Outreach to Native Hawaiian Organizations
    OVW's targeted engagement with Native Hawaiian organizations is 
designed to deepen OVW's understanding of the existing resources and 
capacities of, and identify opportunities to support, organizations 
that are or could address the needs of survivors of domestic violence, 
dating violence, sexual assault, sex trafficking, and stalking in their 
communities. OVW officials have made several trips to Hawai`i, engaging 
directly with both Native Hawaiian organizations and other entities 
that serve the Native Hawaiian community. I recently returned from one 
of these trips and saw firsthand both the significant barriers to 
safety that survivors face, and the remarkable ways advocates are 
leveraging cultural and community strengths to serve survivors and hold 
offenders accountable.
    We have met with organizations serving or representing Native 
Hawaiian domestic violence and sexual assault survivors such as Pouhana 
O Na Wahine and EPIC `Ohana. On my recent trip, EPIC `Ohana told me not 
only about the profound work they are doing with children and youth, 
but also how they are addressing domestic and sexual violence. For 
example, they have developed Pu`uhonua `o Ka Ululehua, which is a 
culturally specific program for Native Hawaiian survivors of domestic 
violence, sexual assault, and family violence. Pu`uhonua `o Ka Ululehua 
creates healing cohorts for survivors and creates spaces for survivors 
to ``participate in Native Hawaiian practices that promote individual 
and family wellbeing and healing.'' They provide ``culturally relevant, 
trauma-informed, and evidence-informed practices'' that are 
transformative.
    We have spoken with the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, the Queen 
Lili`uokalani Trust, Papa Ola Lokahi, and many others, because we 
recognize that addressing domestic violence, sexual assault, and 
stalking extends beyond victim services organizations and includes 
Native Hawaiian child welfare organizations and health systems. Every 
advocate with whom we met talked about the importance of programming 
that is deeply rooted in culture, community, spirituality, connection 
to the land, and family. This comprehensive engagement has helped us 
refine our approach to supporting advocates and organizations who can 
effectively shape responses to domestic violence, sexual assault, and 
stalking that are rooted in this culturally specific work, and we plan 
to build on and grow this outreach over the next year.
    Our immediate priority is to ensure that organizations serving 
Native Hawaiians have the information and support they need to apply 
for a wide range of OVW grant programs, including the Culturally 
Specific Services grant program, Legal Assistance for Victims Program's 
Expanding Legal Services Initiative, Transitional Housing Program, 
Restorative Practices Program, Abuse in Later Life Program, and many 
others. Once organizations are funded, we look forward to assisting 
them in managing these funds effectively. This effort also involves 
working with the State of Hawai`i's STOP Violence Against Women and 
Sexual Assault Services Formula grant administrator to support their 
outreach to Native Hawaiian and other culturally specific organizations 
to receive subgrants under OVW's formula funding to the state.
    In addition, the VAWA Technical Amendment Act of 2022 amended the 
definition of ``tribal coalition,'' 34 U.S.C.  12291(a)(42), and the 
authorizing language for the Tribal Coalitions Program, 34 U.S.C.  
10441(d), to include certain organizations addressing domestic violence 
and sexual assault against Native Hawaiian women through services to 
Native Hawaiian communities. \11\ These changes were effective on 
December 28, 2022. We incorporated these updates into OVW's FY 2023 
Tribal Coalitions Program solicitation and related program materials, 
and we have conducted targeted outreach to identify organizations 
eligible for this funding.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ See Pub. L. No. 117-315, 136 Stat. 4404.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To date, OVW has not received any requests from Native Hawaiian 
organizations for Tribal Coalitions funding. However, several 
organizations have expressed interest in submitting future 
applications. We anticipate that our continued engagement will foster 
the formation of a new coalition supporting Native Hawaiian survivors 
and advocates. In the interim, OVW will continue to make its 
grantmaking application process accessible to more organizations by 
enhancing application assistance support, eliminating unnecessary 
application requirements, increasing the use of plain language in 
solicitations, and offering webinars to potential applicants to walk 
through the grant programs and their specific application requirements.
    Our commitment extends beyond simply providing access to funding; 
it encompasses strengthening the capacity of Native Hawaiian 
organizations to serve survivors effectively. OVW staff have engaged 
with the University of Hawai`i at Manoa to learn about the University's 
work hosting capacity-building events for local and Native Hawaiian 
organizations. These meetings were crucial for assessing the needs of 
Native Hawaiian community-based nonprofits in terms of organizational 
capacity-building, ensuring that services for survivors are sustained.
    Currently, OVW supports a technical assistance project at the Asian 
Pacific Institute on Gender-Based Violence, which includes a staff 
member based in Hawai`i dedicated to working with Asian American, 
Pacific Islander, and Native Hawaiian communities. However, based on 
information learned from recent engagements, OVW's FY 2024 Training and 
Technical Assistance Solicitation called for proposals to provide 
specialized technical assistance and training to victim service 
organizations, advocates, and allied professionals serving Native 
Hawaiian and Pacific Islander survivors of domestic violence, sexual 
assault, dating violence, and stalking. The project is expected to 
establish and maintain a peer-to-peer network and to develop resources 
and training focused on victim services programming, capacity building 
and sustainability, and leadership development. OVW anticipates making 
an award for this project by September 30, 2024.
Not Invisible Act Commission (NIAC) Response
    Effectively addressing the disproportionately high rates of 
American Indian and Alaska Native people who are reported missing, 
experience human trafficking, or suffer from violent crime, including 
murder, continues to be a priority at the Department. These matters of 
public safety imperil individual well-being and the well-being of whole 
communities; the impact of a loved one disappearing from a community or 
suffering from violence is devastating. When tragedy strikes, families 
and communities deserve urgent, sustained, and meaningful responses 
from authorities.
    DOJ efforts to address violent crime in Native communities, 
including missing or murdered Indigenous people (MMIP) and human 
trafficking, are years-long and Department-wide. DOJ is grateful for 
Congress's partnership on these issues over the years, which has 
included legislation such as the Not Invisible Act and Savanna's Act, 
both of which have been instrumental in focusing our resources and 
efforts.
Support for the NIAC
    On May 5, 2022, as mandated by the Not Invisible Act of 2019 (Pub. 
L. No. 116-166), the Secretary of the Interior announced the 41 members 
of the Not Invisible Act Commission (Commission or NIAC). The 
Commission included individuals who have expertise in or are dedicated 
to addressing the MMIP crisis and human trafficking, including Tribal 
officials, law enforcement personnel, mental health professionals, 
victim advocates, scholars, survivors, and family members of victims.
    DOJ welcomed the opportunity to work with such a diverse 
Commission. As required by the Act, DOJ named six DOJ experts from the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Civil Rights Division, OVW, 
the Office for Victims of Crime, the National Institute of Justice, and 
the U.S. Attorney community to serve as Commissioners. At the request 
of the Commission, the Department later provided additional 
representatives from the FBI and DOJ's National Native American 
Outreach Services Liaison. Supporting the work of the Commission and 
addressing its recommendations have been and will continue to be 
priorities for the Department.
    The Commission delved into some of the most challenging Tribal 
public safety issues of our day, including criminal jurisdiction; 
resources; law enforcement coverage and coordination; victim rights and 
services; and the factors that increase individual vulnerability, 
including housing insecurity, substance use, and past victimization. To 
develop its recommendations, the Commission held seven in-person 
hearings in different regions of the country and a two-day virtual 
session to hear directly from survivors, family members, law 
enforcement, and subject matter experts. In total, the Commission 
collected over 260 testimonies, which were instrumental in developing 
the final recommendations. DOJ wishes to particularly thank the 
survivors and family members of victims who participated in the 
development of the Commission's report, both those who served on the 
Commission and those who testified before the Commission about their 
heartbreaking experiences. The recommendations reflect the lived 
experiences of these survivors and family members of victims, which are 
essential to our efforts to finding lasting solutions to address MMIP 
and human trafficking.
    On November 1, 2023, DOJ and the Department of the Interior (DOI) 
received the Commission's final report, entitled ``Not One More: 
Findings and Recommendations of the Not Invisible Act Commission.'' Of 
the 300 recommendations included in the final report, 148 are directed 
at DOJ and 48 are directed at DOI; the other 114 are directed at other 
agencies or branches of government. The recommendations reflect how 
seriously the Commission took the charge laid out in the Not Invisible 
Act itself. The depth and breadth of the recommendations would not have 
been possible without the broad expertise and experience of the 
Commissioners. DOJ is profoundly grateful for the work of the 
Commission, and its recommendations will be critical to our work going 
forward.
    DOJ and DOI issued a joint response addressing those 
recommendations focused on our agencies on March 5, 2024. \12\ DOJ 
strove to respond to the recommendations with the same spirit of 
respect and dedication evident in the Commission's final report and has 
dedicated resources across the Department to ensure that implementation 
of the joint response significantly advances DOJ's efforts to promote 
public safety in Native communities and address MMIP and human 
trafficking.

Responses to Commission Recommendations
    DOJ and DOI recognized how important it was to work together to 
support the Commission and to collaborate on the responses. This 
collaborative approach will be instrumental as the two agencies focus 
on implementing commitments made in the response document. As the 
Commission finalized its recommendations, it called on agencies, 
particularly those participating in Commission meetings, not only to 
respond to the recommendations but also to provide greater transparency 
where possible. DOJ took that to heart, so the response document 
provides a good deal of background information and context in the hope 
that the document is useful for a wide range of readers.
    In response to the thoughtful and focused recommendations of the 
Commission, DOJ made a variety of commitments that implicate a broad 
span of the Department's public safety work in support of Native 
communities, committing to continue or expand ongoing initiatives and 
to engage in new activities. Out of the 148 recommendations directed at 
DOJ, there are 24 that the Department is not able to move forward on in 
whole in or in part because the recommended actions go beyond the 
Department's current authorities. For example, some recommendations 
involve state or local authorities, such as medical examiners, or would 
require statutory changes, such as revising allowable uses of federal 
grant funds.
    The following are some examples of DOJ commitments from the 
response document. Tribal Access Program (TAP): The Commission 
supported expanding this program, which provides Tribes with access to 
national crime information systems for federally authorized criminal 
justice and non-criminal justice purposes. Using TAP, Tribes have 
shared information about missing persons; registered convicted sex 
offenders; entered domestic violence orders of protection for 
nationwide enforcement; run criminal histories; identified and arrested 
fugitives; entered bookings and convictions; and completed fingerprint-
based record checks for non-criminal justice purposes such as screening 
employees or volunteers who work with children. \13\

    \13\ https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-tribal-
access-program-will-continue-improve-exchange-criticaldata.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TAP has been expanded every year since its 2015 launch and now 
serves 132 Tribes with over 400 participating Tribal government 
agencies. DOJ expects to announce the next TAP expansion opportunity in 
summer 2024.
    MMIP Regional Outreach Program and Improved Collaboration: This 
program, coordinated by the Department's Executive Office for United 
States Attorneys, aids in the prevention of and response to MMIP 
through the permanent placement of 10 attorneys and coordinators in 
five designated regions to provide specialized support to United States 
Attorneys' Offices (USAOs). This support includes assisting in the 
investigation of unresolved MMIP cases and related crimes, and 
promoting communication, coordination, and collaboration among Tribal, 
federal, and state governmental and non-governmental partners. The 
program complements the significant MMIPrelated work of the existing 
local Tribal Liaisons and Indian country prosecutors and the work of 
DOJ's National Native American Outreach Services Liaison and National 
Indian Country Training Initiative Coordinator.
    In consultations prior to the creation of the Commission, and 
during discussions with the Commission, DOJ heard a call for a 
permanent MMIP outreach program, which DOJ then rolled out in June 
2023. DOJ representatives were able to discuss implementation plans 
with the Commission, and the Department expects that the program will 
continue to benefit from the Commission's recommendations, including 
with respect to improving coordination across federal agencies on MMIP 
and human trafficking efforts. To that end, DOJ newly committed 
throughout the response document to collaborating more closely with our 
federal partners to align and coordinate our efforts to address MMIP 
and human trafficking, including engaging with the Department of 
Homeland Security to better understand its existing programs that can 
address MMIP-related matters and working with DOI's Missing and 
Murdered Unit to establish review teams within the five program regions 
to conduct case solvability assessments and develop investigative 
strategic plans, among other activities.
    Tribal Special Assistant United States Attorneys: The Commission 
recommended that DOJ expand the designation of Tribal Special Assistant 
United States Attorneys (Tribal SAUSAs), recognizing the importance of 
these cross-designated Tribal prosecutors in improving coordination and 
prosecution efforts related to violent crime offenses such as domestic 
violence and sexual assault, which are often precursors to MMIP-related 
events. The Department encourages USAOs to integrate Tribal SAUSAs into 
regular operations to increase the likelihood that every violent 
offense that is appropriate for prosecution is prosecuted in either 
federal or Tribal court. In addition, DOJ grantmaking components--
including OVW--have funded Tribes to hire prosecutors, identified in 
collaboration with their local USAOs, to be designated as SAUSAs. 
Tribal SAUSAs are trained in federal law, procedure, and investigative 
techniques and complement the work of Tribal Liaisons and Indian 
country prosecutors to strengthen relationships between Tribes and 
USAOs. OVW has five open Tribal SAUSA grant awards and expects to make 
additional awards by the end of FY 2024. As resources allow, DOJ is 
committed to expanding this successful model.
    Collaborative Law Enforcement: In accordance with the Commission's 
recommendations that the U.S. Marshals Service recognize Tribal 
warrants, DOJ has developed a legislative proposal that would extend 
USMS' existing authority to execute arrest warrants-which includes 
investigating and executing state and local arrest warrants for serious 
violent felons-to assist, at the request of a Tribe, in the 
apprehension of serious violent Tribal felons. The Department has 
shared it with Members of the Committee and looks forward to working 
with lawmakers to get this legislative proposal enacted into law.
    Prosecutions: USAOs with Indian country responsibilities have 
operational plans that are updated annually in consultation with Tribal 
partners to ensure that clear protocols are established between 
federal, Tribal, and state law enforcement partners to effectively 
respond to violent crime in Tribal communities. In a July 13, 2022, 
memorandum, Deputy Attorney General Monaco declared it a Department 
priority to address the disproportionately high rates of violence 
experienced by American Indians and Alaska Natives, and relatedly, the 
high rates of Indigenous persons reported missing, and she charged the 
USAOs to address violence against women and children and MMIP in their 
operational plans. In response, USAOs have designated Tribal Liaisons 
and Assistant U.S. Attorneys assigned to Indian country work to enhance 
day-to-day intergovernmental relationships with Tribal communities to 
ensure that cases are identified and prosecuted in coordination with 
Tribal partners. The Commission's recommendations underscored the need 
for DOJ to continue efforts to prioritize prosecutions of crime in 
Indian country and coordinate effectively with Tribal agencies.
    Training: The Department's National Indian Country Training 
Initiative (NICTI) is a robust training program committed to meeting 
the training needs of not only federal prosecutors and law enforcement 
working in Indian country, but also Tribal and state partners, in a 
format that is accessible to as many federal, Tribal, and state 
partners as possible. These trainings are offered free of charge to 
federal, Tribal, and state law enforcement partners including criminal 
justice entities, social service organizations, medical providers, and 
Tribal leaders. In the past year alone, NICTI organized more than 25 
separate trainings related to violence against women and children and 
issues related to MMIP. NICTI will continue to expand its reach in 
response to the NIAC's recommendations and in consultation with federal 
and Tribal partners.
    Savanna's Act Guidelines: Savanna's Act guidelines are intended to 
improve the federal government's response to MMIP matters. All USAOs in 
federal judicial districts with Tribal lands, including Public Law 280 
states, have had Savanna's Act guidelines in place since the spring of 
2022. As recommended by the Commission and with the assistance of DOJ's 
MMIP Regional Outreach Program, USAOs with Indian country 
responsibilities will continue to refine and update their guidelines 
with input from federal, Tribal, state, and local partners to ensure 
that the guidelines remain effective in enhancing inter-jurisdictional 
cooperation as victims' families await word on their loved ones.
    Tribal Community Response Plans (TCRPs): As recommended by the 
Commission, USAOs, with assistance from the MMIP Regional Outreach 
Program, will continue to support and assist Tribal communities in the 
development of TCRPs, which are cross-jurisdictional protocols tailored 
to a specific Tribal community that govern law enforcement and 
community responses to emergent missing person cases in a Tribal 
community. In addition, in FY 2023, the Department's Office of 
Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) funded a project 
with the National Criminal Justice Training Center to support 
community-led TCRPs.
    Supporting Survivors of Crime and Improving Communication with 
Families: The Office of Justice Programs' (OJP) Office for Victims of 
Crime (OVC) administers the Tribal set aside from Victims of Crime Act 
funds as the Tribal Victim Services Set-aside Formula Grant Program 
(TVSSA Program). OVC has responded to Tribal feedback, including 
feedback received at its annual consultation, by ensuring funds can be 
used for culturally responsive services for family members of MMIP 
victims, and changing the TVSSA Program policy to permit Tribal 
governments to use grant funding to support--in limited circumstances--
private search efforts for missing persons led by friends and family 
members of a missing person, generating awareness of individual missing 
person cases, and supporting Tribal efforts to establish TCRPs. OVC 
committed to holding a listening session on issues related to the NIAC 
recommendations, including on how community-based feedback and 
culturally relevant program evaluation can be used to inform 
grantfunded services. One of those listening sessions took place in 
Anchorage in February; three more are planned for other parts of the 
country before the end of the year. OVW committed to exploring ways to 
better address the connection between MMIP and domestic violence, 
dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and sex trafficking, and has 
requested funds in the FY 2025 President's Budget to support Healing 
and Response Teams, a specific recommendation from the Commission. In 
addition to the funding opportunities available to Tribes to support 
services for victims of crime, DOJ will continue to review and enhance 
existing practices and protocols to improve timely and consistent 
communication with victims and families of victims regarding 
investigations and prosecutions. DOJ will use the updated Attorney 
General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance to reinforce how 
federal prosecutors and law enforcement agencies should engage with and 
provide culturally appropriate assistance to victims and their 
families. Finally, the National Native American Outreach Services 
Liaison represents DOJ in efforts to amplify the voices of victims and 
their families as they navigate all stages of the criminal justice 
system. The Commission rightly focused on support for survivors of 
crime throughout its report, and DOJ appreciates the renewed focus and 
recommendations aimed at strengthening the Department's work to ensure 
victims of crime receive the services they need.
    Research and Studies: Commissioners identified the need for 
additional analysis to focus resources and identify patterns. DOJ 
committed to exploring the possibility of several new studies to 
examine the causes of homicide and violent deaths of AI/AN people, to 
identify barriers and challenges in using federally funded information 
sharing resources such as NamUs and the National Center for Missing and 
Exploited Children, and to assess the feasibility of collecting data on 
law enforcement acceptance of missing persons reports from healthcare 
providers and other entities.
    Access to Funding: The Commission included recommendations to make 
DOJ funding more accessible and better aligned with Tribes' needs. DOJ 
committed to building on existing efforts to streamline grant funding 
pursuant to Executive Order 14112 and to further engaging with Tribes 
to identify and apply improvements to public safety funding models, 
including strategies to improve public safety implementation in Alaska 
and potential reforms of P.L. 280 to ensure it is consistent with the 
current and future era of self-determination. In response to Commission 
recommendations related to law enforcement needs, including access to 
grants and resources addressing officer training, mental health, and 
wellness, the response document both described existing programs funded 
by the COPS Office and OJP's Bureau of Justice Assistance and pointed 
to DOJ's Tribal Justice and Safety website with consolidated 
information on DOJ grant funding opportunities open to Tribes and 
Tribal organizations (www.justice.gov/tribal/grants).
    Media Use: The Commission identified a need for more partnerships 
and discussions on making effective use of the media, including social 
media, when someone is reported missing. DOJ committed to exploring 
further development of relationships with Tribal organizations to 
ensure public information is readily available to disseminate via 
appropriate channels, including social media. DOJ also committed to 
holding roundtables to help develop guidelines and best practices to 
promote accurate and complete media coverage of MMIP and human 
trafficking cases and identify the types of media/social media coaching 
that would be most useful to support families and communities.
    Missing or Trafficked Youth: The Commission recommended that DOJ 
take steps to address the factors that may lead children and youth to 
go missing, including the risk that children and youth in foster care, 
child welfare, and juvenile justice systems face for being trafficked. 
OJP's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention committed 
to considering appropriate opportunities to convene a roundtable to 
discuss children and youth who voluntarily go missing to better 
understand what is currently happening in the field and discuss 
possible solutions.
Implementation
    Since issuing its March 5th response, DOJ has begun implementing 
the commitments made in the response document. DOJ's MMIP Steering 
Committee, in place since November 2021, is instrumental in shepherding 
and overseeing the Department's work to respond to the MMIP crisis and 
will be central to implementation efforts. DOJ knows that our ability 
to make progress on these issues will depend heavily on our ability to 
coordinate closely with our Tribal partners, across the federal 
government, and across jurisdictions.
Conclusion
    Close and productive collaborations--within DOJ, with other federal 
agencies, and with our Tribal and Native Hawaiian partners--have been 
the linchpin of the Department's work to implement VAWA 2022, support 
and respond to the NIAC, and broaden access to the Department's 
funding. DOJ is committed to continuing these collaborations going 
forward. It has long been DOJ's philosophy that the best solutions to 
public safety challenges come from the communities and survivors we 
serve, which has been borne out time and again in the Department's 
efforts to support American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian 
communities. In her 2021 memorandum creating a Steering Committee to 
Address the Crisis of Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons, Deputy 
Attorney General Lisa Monaco stated that, ``the Department recognizes 
that challenges faced by Tribes are best met by Tribal solutions.''
    In this spirit, DOJ's work will continue to be rooted in 
consultation and coordination with Tribal governments and Indigenous 
communities. DOJ will schedule government-to-government consultations 
and listening sessions with Tribes--including OVWs 19th Violence 
Against Women Tribal Consultation, to be held November 19-21, 2024, in 
Santa Fe, New Mexico--and work with other agencies, as appropriate, to 
ensure that implementation efforts are responsive to the needs of 
Tribal governments. Similarly, we will continue our partnership and 
engagement with Native Hawaiian organizations to expand crucial 
services to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating 
violence, and stalking.
    I appreciate the time and attention of the Committee and welcome 
the opportunity to answer any questions you may have.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    I will start with you, Ms. Randall. DOJ does not officially 
report its staffing levels in Indian Country. My staff inquired 
with the department. Just this morning, we learned that 145 
assistant U.S. attorneys, 25 DEA agents and 348 FBI personnel 
serve Indian Country. But they were unable to provide us with 
any details on vacancy rates. These are just funded positions. 
We all know that doesn't mean that there is a person out there 
doing the work.
    In contrast, DOI has to report its staffing levels, not 
just the FTEs, authorized and funded, and the unmet needs, to 
Congress annually. I don't want to have to make a law in this 
space. It seems like a goofy thing to make a law about. It 
should be just part of our give and take where you tell us what 
the vacancy rates were.
    The word we got back from DOJ is, we don't count that. I 
don't actually believe that. I think it might be a pain to 
figure it out, but you have to have some way to know what 
positions are filled and not.
    Can you assure me that we are going to get fidelity on that 
data, and that we don't actually have to make a Federal law 
about it?
    Ms. Randall. Senator, I can assure you that increasing the 
resources, including staffing in Indian Country and Alaska, is 
a high priority. We will definitely bring that concern back to 
the department.
    The Chairman. That was not a yes.
    Ms. Randall. We will do everything that we can to provide 
you with the information. I don't know what exactly the 
department has available. But we will do everything that we 
can, Senator.
    The Chairman. Okay. If DOI can get us vacancy rates, you 
guys can figure it out. It may be a data base problem, maybe 
you have to assign a quarter-time staffer to collate the 
information. I do not find it acceptable that you just say, we 
will take it under advisement. This is something that the 
Department of Justice should know. Certainly, whatever version 
of your HR department is aware of where the vacancies are.
    So it may not be that easy to just run a report, because 
maybe your software is old. But you can jot it down and get 
back to us, you can give us a range. I just need a little more 
of a firm commitment that you are going to get us the 
information that we need one way or the other.
    Ms. Randall. I hear that concern and the urgency; we will 
get you everything that we can as quickly as we can.
    The Chairman. Okay. I am not sure what that means, but I 
guess I will move on.
    The OVW is doing outreach to the Native Hawaiian community 
and we are learning more about their unique needs, particularly 
your work with EPIC `Ohana and its focus on culturally relevant 
trauma informed care. How is OVW increasing access to public 
safety and victim services grants for Native Hawaiian 
organizations like EPIC `Ohana?
    Ms. Randall. I just came back a month or so ago from 
Hawaii. We have been engaged for the last two years in really 
targeted outreach to the State, but specifically to Native 
Hawaiian serving organizations. The work that EPIC `Ohana does 
is amazing. Their Pu`uhonua `o Ka Ululehua is amazing, the way 
they have developed a very specific domestic violence program 
within their greater work.
    So what we wanted to ensure is that organizations have 
access to all of our funding, whether that is our tribal 
coalitions funding or restorative practices, culturally 
specific services. To date so far this year, our applications 
from organizations in Hawaii to competitive discretionary grant 
programs has gone from the unacceptable number of one to nine. 
So I sincerely hope that we are making progress, Senator.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Commissioner Kunesh, does the ANA work with Native Hawaiian 
organizations to support trauma-informed services?
    Ms. Kunesh. Yes, thank you for that question, Senator. We 
certainly do. We have quite a lot of Native Hawaiian 
organizations that we serve, one of which is the Pua'a 
Foundation, which supports Native Hawaiians who are involved in 
the criminal justice system btu also have interactions perhaps 
with violence, perhaps with missing, murdered indigenous as 
well as human trafficking.
    The Chairman. Could HRSA assist in collaborating with OVW, 
given its role with Native Hawaiian health care systems?
    Ms. Kunesh. Yes, is that a request?
    The Chairman. That is a request for you.
    Ms. Kunesh. Yes, a request, yes, absolutely. And in fact, 
ANA does also support the EPIC program as well.
    The Chairman. I am not tricky. I am sometimes unpleasant, 
but not tricky.
    [Laughter.]
    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    Vice Chair Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't know 
about being unpleasant.
    Ms. Randall, thank you for going to Fairbanks to be part of 
the Alaska Intertribal Working Group. I think every amount of 
engagement on the ground is so much more beneficial.
    I know for certain that you heard what I hear when I am 
talking to those who are trying to make some headway when it 
comes to public safety. When we had Attorney General Barr in 
the State, his follow-on was to provide some assistance through 
grants.
    We explained to Attorney General Garland when he came later 
that what we need if we are going to do these long-term 
transformational changes, it hinges on flexible funding 
streams. I think Attorney General Garland seemed to agree with 
me, and I think that is why he directed the Office of Tribal 
Justice and the DOJ grant-making offices to figure out, let's 
figure out what all the options are here, including 
legislation, for improving these funding opportunities.
    So the question is whether or not you are looking at 
proposing legislation. We all know that the clock is running on 
advancing legislation. But are you considering initial 
consultation on any legislative proposals? If the answer is yes 
to all this, I would like to see the direction that you are 
taking with any proposed legislation.
    Ms. Randall. The department is looking at every level, from 
what can we do right now to improve the flexibility and access 
to our funds, to what type of legislative proposals might allow 
us to better streamline and address public safety and victim 
services. For any big issues, we absolutely want to consult and 
then of course work very closely with your office.
    Senator Murkowski. Again, as you are looking, legislation 
is going to be one aspect of it. If you are in that position, 
we would like to see the direction and some proposal before we 
go on the August break. We all spend a lot of time up in the 
State then. And knowing the direction that you are looking 
would be important.
    When you think about the frustration with competitive 
funding and again, the effort to try to move toward formula 
grants, DOJ's Office of Victim Servies, OVC, the Tribal Victim 
Service set-aside program, is a good example where we have seen 
that you can actually put this into place. Is there anything in 
statute that prevents other grant programs from being converted 
to formula from the competitive like OVC did with the tribal 
victims set-aside? Is that also in your array of options that 
you are looking to?
    Ms. Randall. Yes, looking at how we can make these funds 
more easily accessible, such as through formula, is absolutely 
something that we think about. We consulted on it last year, in 
fact, and have consulted on it before.
    Senator Murkowski. What is the status on that consultation?
    Ms. Randall. Our challenge is that there was very mixed 
feedback from the tribes. Whenever you have a smaller pool of 
funding, we have less funding available than OVC, that means 
that there would be a number of tribes receiving incredibly 
small grant programs. So opinion varies widely from tribe to 
tribe, and there is not consensus on doing so.
    With additional resources, it would be easier for us to 
convert to a formula.
    Senator Murkowski. Okay, well, again, we understand that 
you are going to have different perspectives that are going to 
influence one way or another. I am trying to make sure that as 
you are taking these initial steps, again, there is a sharing 
of information back and forth. I wanted to ask you, Assistant 
Secretary Newland, in my opening comments, I noted that we had 
directed the BIA to conduct consultation on the budgetary needs 
in P.L. 280 States for tribal law enforcement. They are 
supposed to report back on the available funding.
    Can you share with me the timelines for your consultations 
as we directed in the Interior bill and where you are with 
that?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Madam Vice Chair. I don't have that 
information for you this afternoon. I could likely get you an 
answer to that by tomorrow morning.
    Senator Murkowski. All right. Are you participating in the 
Alaska Intertribal Work Group meetings as they advance, as part 
of Interior?
    Mr. Newland. I am not, no.
    Senator Murkowski. But is somebody within Interior part of 
that?
    Mr. Newland. I will have to get back to you, Madam Vice 
Chair. I apologize, I don't have that information.
    Senator Murkowski. I get it, and I understand that. I am 
just looking at, there is so much intersect, there is so much 
interplay between Department of Justice, Department of Interior 
and Department of Health and Human Services. We can't have DOJ 
over here not talking and intersecting with what Interior and 
HHS is. So it is a little bit of cross-pollination that is 
going to allow us to leverage all of this.
    I would hope that it is not just when we bring you together 
for an oversight hearing that you are learning more about what 
is going on, but that this is actually happening interagency, 
interdepartmental.
    Mr. Newland. Madam Vice Chair, I can tell you that we do 
collaborate, not only with Ms. Randall's office at DOJ at 
weekly and monthly meetings with our counterparts at the 
department on the criminal justice and law enforcement side. 
That is something that is a priority, and Madam Vice Chair, if 
I may just, on the flexibility for funding, too, emphasize that 
the President has issued an executive order to direct all 
Federal agencies to make tribal access to funding and grants 
more flexible and direct all of us as agencies to work to 
streamline that process and make sure that funds are available 
to tribes.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Cortez Masto?

           STATEMENT OF HON. CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and our 
Ranking Member, for all the great work you are doing in this 
space.
    Ms. Randall, I am going to take advantage of having you in 
front of me from DOJ to ask you a couple of questions that I 
need clarification on. It is hard to, as you can tell, get 
answers from the U.S. Attorneys offices at times.
    Here is my challenge. In your testimony you highlight that 
the DOJ's MMIP regional outreach program staff is assisting 
U.S. Attorneys offices in updating and refining their Savanna's 
Act guidelines. The DOJ response to the Not Invisible 
Commission report states that all U.S. Attorneys' offices and 
Federal judicial districts with tribal lands have established 
guidelines.
    I need verification that one, every single U.S. Attorneys 
office across this Country has established those guidelines; 
and two, I want verification they actually have assigned staff 
to focus, not just an AUSA, but the FBI and anyone else within 
DOJ to focus on this work. I can't get those answers.
    I kind of want clarification here. I worked as an AUSA here 
in the Washington, D.C. office. Is it still set up that the 
Associate Attorney General oversees programs including your 
office of Violence Against Women? Is that correct?
    Ms. Randall. Yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Okay. And then the Deputy Attorney 
General oversees a separate division that includes the U.S. 
Attorney's office, DEA and FBI. Is that still set up the same 
way?
    Ms. Randall. Yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. So the Associate Attorney General has 
nothing to do with the FBI, the U.S. Attorney's office, but the 
Deputy Attorney General does, correct?
    Ms. Randall. The Deputy Attorney General also oversees 
broadly our work.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Right. But the Associate Attorney 
General does not?
    Ms. Randall. No.
    Senator Cortez Masto. So you cannot sit here and guarantee 
us that there will be that connection, oversight, and 
information, because you have to go back to the Deputy Attorney 
General to get this information, correct?
    Ms. Randall. Well, some information I have, such as that 
every U.S. Attorney with tribal obligations has had their 
Savanna's Act guidelines in place since 2022. They are, of 
course, meant to be living documents, that those U.S. 
Attorney's offices must consult and continue. They all have not 
just AUSAs, but they have --
    Senator Cortez Masto. So you have that information, but you 
don't have the information on how many have been assigned to 
focus in this area from AUSAs, FBI, and DEA?
    Ms. Randall. I apologize that I don't have all the 
information.
    Senator Cortez Masto. And I am not putting you on the spot, 
in other words, maybe you are not entitled to have that. Maybe 
you shouldn't have that. Maybe it should be in another area of 
DOJ. But those are the answers we want. If you are not the 
right person, maybe we need the Deputy here to answer those 
questions.
    Because this is my challenge all along. I can't say this, 
stress this enough, as somebody who worked in the U.S. 
Attorney's office, but also in the State of Nevada, worked as 
the Attorney General, working with our tribal communities, 
working with BIA, working with the FBI, working with the U.S. 
Attorneys, I also know that not every single U.S. Attorney's 
office focuses in this space. Nor do they assign enough staff.
    With that said, it may be that they are understaffed and 
under resourced. I know the BIA is, because I talk to BIA 
agents in Nevada. Their geographic territory is ridiculous, and 
there are very few of them. But there are very few AUSAs 
assigned and FBI agents as well.
    So this is the information we need. If we are going to 
provide the support for the resources, you need to address all 
these issues that we are now asking you to take a look at 
through Savanna's Act and the Not Invisible Act.
    That is what I want to pull from you, is that if anything 
you take back, please take it back to the top management at 
DOJ. We just need answers. We want to work together, but we 
need answers to some of these questions. Because I am tired of 
hearing from my tribal communities, and rightfully so, that 
they are just not getting any support. Not every tribal 
community in my State has the opportunity to have law 
enforcement. So they do have to rely on Federal partners, and 
they are just not there all the time.
    I can't get answers as to why DOJ is not there. So please 
take that back.
    I am going to jump to Assistant Secretary Newland. Thank 
you for being here.
    Can you talk a little bit about, in BIA's Missing and 
Murdered unit, it provides critical criminal justice services 
for MMIP. The DOI's response to the Not Invisible Act 
Commission report highlights that shortages of BIA law 
enforcement can lead to missing and murdered unit personnel to 
be temporarily reassigned to other public safety needs.
    At the time of the report response in March 2024, DOI 
stated that only 32 of the 66 positions nationwide within the 
Missing and Murdered unit were actually filled. So can you 
address that? What progress has DOI made to staffing these 34 
remaining positions?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator. I will just briefly if I 
can, Mr. Chairman, with the time, we have added some staff. We 
have had just a persistent problem in our hiring process of 
really breaking through and getting close to full staffing, 
both within the MMU and across OJS nationwide.
    The parity initiative has helped slow or stall our 
attrition rate within BIA law enforcement. It has made some 
improvements around the margin. I do think additional changes 
are needed, as I testified at the recent hearing.
    So we have added some additional staff to the MMU. But we 
are not close to full staffing yet, and that is something that 
we are putting a lot of emphasis on with our human capital team 
and looking for levers that we can pull where we have authority 
right now.
    Senator Cortez Masto. I know I am going over my time, but 
just so I understand, it is not for lack of having the people 
that are interested in the job, it is the challenges with pay 
and other challenges that need to be addressed, background 
checks?
    Mr. Newland. It is an all of the above, Senator. It is a 
matter of recruitment, but it is also a challenge getting folks 
hired in a timely manner. We are competing against States, 
cities and counties for police officers as well. It is 
frustrating, but it is a point of emphasis for us.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Rounds?

                STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE ROUNDS, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA

    Senator Rounds. Thank you, Chairman Schatz and Vice Chair 
Murkowski. And thank you to our witnesses for taking the time 
to attend today's hearing.
    Residents of tribal communities on the northern plains are 
experiencing a public safety crisis. According to recent crime 
data, numerous tribes are encountering violent crime rates five 
times higher than the U.S. national average.
    In the last year, three tribal governments in the State of 
South Dakota have declared a state of emergency in response to 
public safety threats. With low personnel numbers and a high 
number of calls for assistance, tribal law enforcement officers 
often struggle to respond to respond to emergencies in a timely 
manner. One tribal law enforcement agency in South Dakota 
relies on a total of three officers per shift to patrol over 
1.6 million acres of land.
    In response to the police shortages, some residents of 
tribal communities have even resorted to establishing citizen 
patrols to look out for crime. Criminal entities are taking 
note of the lack of manpower and are directly targeting 
reservation communities. As a result, tribal law enforcement 
officers are encountering higher volumes of illegal drugs, 
including fentanyl.
    I look forward to hearing ways that the witnesses believe 
the Federal Government can help improve law enforcement 
services in Indian Country, especially as tribal members 
continue to deal with serious threats to public safety.
    Let me close by saying that tribal members from South 
Dakota are frustrated, really deeply frustrated by the inaction 
of the Department of the Interior. Look, I really appreciate 
the fact that the Chairman and the Vice Chair have held this 
really important hearing today and provided us with an 
opportunity for some oversight. I have just a few questions I 
wanted to ask.
    I am going to begin with Assistant Secretary Newland. As 
you know, the majority of prospective tribal officers, 
including direct service and 638 officers, are required to 
receive training at the Indian Police Academy in Artesia, New 
Mexico. According to several tribal leaders, this distance has 
hampered recruitment efforts on the northern plains.
    On April 3rd, I had sent a letter specifically about this 
particular issue to you. I am just curious, Secretary Newland, 
will you commit to exploring possible alternative training 
options on the northern plains? It is my hope that not only 
will you consider that but you would agree to meet with us and 
see if we can't find a path forward, so that we can actually 
fill law enforcement positions that we can't fill today.
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator. I would be happy to work 
with anyone who wants to help us address these challenges. I 
will note that the BIA law enforcement accepts people as 
recruits who have completed State academy training, so long as 
it is supplemented with the appropriate Federal training that 
is required to become a BIA law enforcement agent.
    Senator Rounds. And I think that is part of the problem, is 
that even after they have done the local law enforcement 
training, they are still required to leave and go to basically 
Artesia in order to get training. In doing so, we are losing 
qualified candidates. So once again, I am just simply, I think 
there is an opportunity here, and I know the State of South 
Dakota has offered to assist in training. But most certainly, 
if they still have to leave, we are going to lose those 
officers.
    I just ask, would you try to work with us to find an 
alternative path to get the same types of training that right 
now we are not able to get, and keep these officers in with our 
tribes?
    Mr. Newland. Absolutely, Senator.
    Senator Rounds. Thank you.
    Then also, Assistant Secretary Newland, in the last two 
years several tribal leaders have asked the BIA for additional 
resources to deal with the uptick in serious crime. This has 
included requests for increased funding and personnel.
    When a tribal law enforcement agency is encountering 
significant threats to public safety, does the BIA offer any 
emergency resources to officers on the ground?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator. That is a tough question. 
It goes back to Senator Cortez Masto's question. Right now, we 
are in a position where, when there is an emergency or crisis 
on the ground, that if we have to detail officers, we are 
taking them out of a community where they are already 
understaffed as well. So what we have proposed, including the 
President's Fiscal Year 2025 budget, is additional funding to 
help us address this issue nationwide.
    I want to note that the President's budget would allow us 
to add 222 additional Federal and tribal law enforcement 
officers across the Country, with the 198 tribes and locations 
that we fund.
    So that is our best bet for a long-term solution. 
Otherwise, we are pulling, detailing officers out, and then we 
hear justifiable criticism and concern from tribal leaders in 
those communities when we are moving officers out to address a 
crisis elsewhere.
    Senator Rounds. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the 
time to be able to ask these questions. I don't think this is 
just in the northern plains. I think this is across a large 
swath of Indian Country. And I think we really have to get back 
in and take a look at whether or not the resources that are 
provided and those additional resources that are being offered, 
if we could streamline the process to get back down to the 
tribes, boots on the ground, see if we can't find a way so that 
these individuals that are coming in and right now are being 
required to leave their homes and communities for six months or 
more for training, if we can't get that done in a more local 
area where we can actually get them to be on the job and then 
to be able to stay on the job.
    Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Rounds.
    Assistant Secretary Newland, you previously testified that 
23 of the 96 detention centers in Indian Country are in poor 
condition and replacing them will cost at least $590 million. 
The President's budget only requests $156 million. Why the 
delta?
    Mr. Newland. That is a tough question, Chairman. I know our 
proposed budget in Fiscal Year 2025 would add over $30 million 
for new construction, which would allow us to replace on 
average about one facility. This is something that we are 
working to add money to.
    I will note if I may, Mr. Chairman, that if you look at the 
Tribal Law and Order Act report, the three categories where we 
note that we are falling short with police officers, courts and 
detention, the area where we are the closest actually right now 
is full funding for detention. But that excludes construction.
    So if you were to add construction on top of that, the 
Tribal Law and Order Act would show about a $730 million----
    The Chairman. So what is the $590 million, repair?
    Mr. Newland. Pardon?
    The Chairman. What does the $590 million represent, if it 
is not construction?
    Mr. Newland. Repair and replacement.
    The Chairman. Okay. Repair and replacement, so some 
construction. Just not new build. Your person is nodding, so 
maybe that is right?
    Mr. Newland. Yes, some construction, correct.
    The Chairman. Okay, thank you for that.
    I will just note that 16 of the 23 poor condition jails are 
located in States represented by members of the Senate 
Committee on Indian Affairs. So this is something that we ought 
to work together on, on a bipartisan basis.
    Ms. Randall, increasing the number of tribal specialist 
assistant U.S. attorneys is one of the Not Invisible Act 
recommendations, or the commission's recommendations. DOJ 
agreed with the commission in its response but the President's 
budget only requests flat funding for this program, $3 million.
    This seems to me to be a really inexpensive way to have a 
greater law enforcement presence. I understand resource 
constraints, and I understand it is a tough question. You say 
this is so important, and your real answer is, well, OMB didn't 
let me, right? I understand what happens here.
    But $3 million for this very important approach that will 
make just such an outsized difference, I really think we have 
to kind of rethink how we deploy our resources here. To the 
extent that we all cared about the Not Invisible Act and we are 
anxious to hear their recommendations, and they kind of came up 
through a real process that we are all pretty proud of, now it 
is time to do the things that they are saying we should do. And 
$3 million is not going to get it done.
    Can we work together to increase the resources in this 
space and get the DOJ sort of full-throatedly behind not just 
the funding aspect but the implementation?
    Ms. Randall. We would be delighted to work together to 
increase resources. If I may, just one example, the Mississippi 
Band of Choctaw, with their tribal SAUSA award, they brought 
some of the first Federal prosecutions stemming from the 
reservation, the first ever habitual domestic violence offender 
indictment and a homicide case. They have received and accepted 
over 90 VAWA cases and prosecuted 30 so far, just this tribal 
AUSA.
    So this is something we think could be very successful.
    The Chairman. My understanding is there is something called 
the Monaco Doctrine, which basically encourages DOJ to, the 
Monaco Memo, excuse me, that encourages DOJ to use this 
technique. So I am sure she is not necessary just staring at a 
screen watching an oversight hearing, but I would like for you 
to communicate back that we want full implementation of this 
idea, which is, hey, if we deputize folks, we can have a bigger 
law enforcement presence.
    I am so excited about this idea, and I am so frustrated at 
what I would consider the lackluster implementation. The good 
thing about this one is it is a solvable problem.
    Senator Daines, are you ready, or should I go to Senator 
Murkowski?

                STATEMENT OF HON. STEVE DAINES, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Senator Daines. I am ready.
    The Chairman. Okay, Senator Daines.
    Senator Daines. Chairman Schatz, thank you. Vice Chairman 
Murkowski, happy birthday. And thanks for the opportunity to 
discuss public safety in Native communities.
    Each time I meet with tribal leaders across Montana, law 
enforcement has become their number one priority. Indian 
Country is in crisis. Tribal leaders I have spoken with have 
told me they feel like they are at war. That is the word they 
use to describe what is happening.
    Multiple reservations in Montana have declared a state of 
emergency in response to the massive influx of fentanyl and 
meth flowing in from the southern border. Cartel members are 
operating with impunity on reservations. They are embedding 
themselves in the community. They are exploiting the lack of 
law enforcement resources and some of the jurisdictional gaps 
we see in Indian Country.
    In fact, according to our attorney general in Montana, his 
office, fentanyl seizures are up 11,000 percent since 2019. 
Montana's tribal communities are ground zero for this 
destruction. You don't always think about Montana being a 
border State. You think about it being a Canadian border State. 
But you look at the way the logistics system works, there is 
just a very short amount of time it takes for the fentanyl to 
get from where the cartels produce it in Mexico, cross the 
southern border into Montana, a matter of 48 hours.
    While the cartels operate unchecked, violent crime, crimes 
against women, crimes against children and human trafficking 
are happening more frequently as this influence spreads. I was 
proud to introduce a resolution to designate May 5th as a 
national day of awareness for missing and murdered Native women 
and girls, so it brings much-needed attention to this issue.
    However, there is much more work to be done to address the 
MMIW crisis and all crime that is going on in Indian Country.
    The BIA, alongside Federal partners like the DEA and the 
FBI, has a responsibility to enforce the law and protect our 
tribal communities.
    Assistant Secretary Newland, a vast majority of tribal law 
enforcement agencies operate under 638 self-determination 
contracts and self-governance compacts, including several in 
Montana. These agreements maximize tribal sovereignty and 
tribal autonomy by allowing the tribe to police their own 
communities and use resources as they see fit.
    But I am concerned that the funding is not being 
appropriately allocated to tribes that enter into the 638 
arrangements with the BIA. Tribal governments, from Northern 
Cheyenne, Fort Belknap, have sued the BIA over stagnant and 
inadequate 638 funding for law enforcement activities. The 
Northern Cheyenne saw an increase in funding as a result of 
those suits.
    The tribes shouldn't have to take the BIA to court to 
squeeze out more resources to serve their communities. I hear 
from our tribes in Montana that funding for 638 contracts is 
too low. It never gets raised. And it is much lower than the 
funding provided to run similar BIA programs.
    Here is my question. What specific measures does the BIA 
have in place to assure that transparency and accountability in 
the decision making process for tribes will fund law 
enforcement programs to the 638 agreements?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator. I appreciate that question 
and I have had the opportunity to spend time at Northern 
Cheyenne, as we have shared with you. The 638 process for any 
program with law enforcement at the BIA is fairly transparent. 
One of the challenges that we have is with the funding that we 
have, we cannot reduce funding for some tribes as new tribes or 
as tribes take on new contracts. So we have to use the funding 
that we have.
    As I was explaining in my prepared oral statement, we saw 
some funding increases for law enforcement for Indian Affairs 
in 2022 and 2023. But when you dive into those increases, only 
$11 million of those increases was available to increase the 
funding nationwide. So we had $11 million in new funds to 
spread across 182 tribes.
    I know this is a concern. I have heard directly through the 
tribal Interior budget committee; we have walked tribal leaders 
through how this funding gets from the appropriation stage into 
tribal accounts through 638 contracts. I would be happy to have 
our team meet with your staff, Senator, to walk them through 
that as well.
    I very much want to get more funding out to tribes to 
address these issues. I think everyone here agrees.
    Senator Daines. Thanks for visiting and engaging our tribes 
on the ground. I think it is really, really important, because 
you all, sometimes it feels like you are a long way away. Which 
you are, physically speaking, geographically speaking.
    But our tribes are exasperated. The 638 program empowers 
them to kind of take control of their destiny. I hope you do 
all you can to make sure they are resourced appropriately. This 
is literally a life and death situation going on in Indian 
Country.
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Daines. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Smith?

                 STATEMENT OF HON. TINA SMITH, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Vice Chair. And 
thanks to all our panelists. It is nice to see you again, 
especially my friend Commissioner Kunesh from Minnesota. Thank 
you.
    I think in a way I am following up on what Senator Daines 
is raising as he is talking about 638 authority, and how we can 
create a better system for tribes to be able to exercise their 
inherent authority to provide public safety on tribal lands. We 
have heard so often about this sort of revolving door that 
occurs when non-Native people come onto tribal land and commit 
horrible crimes, are arrested, then they are released and it 
happens over and over again.
    So I am going to start with you, Ms. Randall. Can you 
briefly tell me, why do you think it is that Federal 
prosecution rates are so low in Indian Country?
    Ms. Randall. Federal prosecutions are essential. As you 
know, this is a top priority for the Deputy Attorney General 
who has said that this is not just a top priority overarchingly 
for the department, but that we must bring every charge that we 
can. Her memo says that these offenses should be investigated 
wherever credible evidence of a violation of Federal law 
exists, and offenses should be prosecuted when the department's 
principles of Federal prosecution are met.
    At the Office of Violence Against Women, we are hoping to 
help reduce the declination of meritorious cases wherever they 
may be. These cases can be really hard to prosecute, whether 
you are Federal, State or local.
    We just on Monday released a framework to help prosecutors 
really successfully bring, for example, domestic violence and 
sexual assault cases.
    Senator Smith. Okay. So the prosecution rates are not what 
they should be, not what they could be, and you are working to 
improve them. I think we would maybe agree that one of the 
challenges we have are some of these, as we have discussed 
earlier, some of the jurisdictional issues that make it 
difficult and complicated, as you were saying, Secretary 
Newland, to make these prosecutions.
    I happen to think that I don't really know that we are 
doing enough in Congress. I think that we know that the best 
solutions for Indian Country are going to come from Indian 
Country. This is especially true in public safety. And we have 
learned this from the special tribal criminal jurisdiction that 
we are creating, that we have created in response to missing 
and murdered indigenous women and relatives.
    So I know that many of us are committed to working on this 
on this Committee. I believe, as I said, that I don't think we 
have done enough.
    Assistant Secretary Newland, could you address this? What, 
in your experience as a tribal leader and as Assistant 
Secretary have shown you about is working about this special 
tribal criminal jurisdiction?
    Mr. Newland. Thank you, Senator. I am sorry, just to 
understand your question, what is working about the VAWA 
jurisdiction?
    Senator Smith. Yes. What are we learning from this 
experience that we might be able to apply to other 
circumstances where similar special jurisdictions might help us 
to get better prosecution rates?
    Mr. Newland. I think, Senator, it is the core principle of 
self-determination, which you were alluding to, is that tribes 
are able to be first responders to public safety concerns. The 
U.S. attorneys, we know, handle just an enormous case load. So 
it makes it difficult for them to get to all of these cases in 
a timely manner that tribal prosecutors and tribal courts just 
don't have to deal with, because they are local.
    I have had the chance to visit some communities that are 
exercising that jurisdiction like Pascua Yaqui in Arizona, and 
see what they have been able to do with their courts and their 
law enforcement agency. It is incredible.
    Senator Smith. Yes, they are getting great results.
    Mr. Newland. Yes.
    Senator Smith. Yes, I think that is right. I think there 
are really important lessons to be learned, and as you said, 
the most important one of them is that if we recognize tribes' 
inherent authority to be able to provide for public safety in 
their nations, that we get better results for all the reasons 
that you outlined.
    Mr. Chair and Vice Chair, and all members of the Committee, 
I think this is something that we can do some more work on. We 
have learned a lot from what we have accomplished with the 
special tribal jurisdiction with VAWA. We should be looking at 
other ways we can do this, and other ways we can extend this 
knowledge to prosecuting, for example, drug crimes as well.
    I look forward to working with my colleagues on this. I 
think there is more we can do.
    The Chairman. Senator Hoeven?

                STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN HOEVEN, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA

    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thanks to both you 
and the Ranking Member Murkowski for calling this hearing on 
public safety on the reservations. It is just incredibly 
important.
    Thanks to all of our witnesses for being here. I really 
think that the key is, we have to get more law enforcement 
officers out there on the ground. BIA is coming nowhere near to 
filling the positions that they have available. We have to do 
more to get those positions filled.
    Right now, according to the testimony received by this 
Committee, there is a 39 percent, almost 40 percent vacancy 
rate for all positions in the BIA Office of Justice Services. 
One of the things, Senator Cortez Masto and I have introduced 
the Bridging Agency Data Gaps and Ensuring Safety, or BADGES 
Act, to try to expedite getting more officers into these 
positions. That would allow BIA to basically pilot a program to 
conduct background checks to try to expedite that service.
    But we have to recruit and train more agents. Of course 
that is why we started the Advanced Training Center at Camp 
Grafton. We have the program at Artesia, which you are all very 
well familiar with, but you have an incredibly even higher 
vacancy rate in the northern Great Plains. Part of it is 
proximity, just getting people recruited and going to these 
schools. Of course, it is harder to get them to go down to New 
Mexico, and if they did, to come back to the northern Great 
Plains. So that was the whole concept.
    It is working, but we have to do more. The last data I have 
is that in 2021, BIA put almost 5,500 people through the law 
enforcement and public safety training programs, 5,429. Of 
those, 3,920, so about 5,500, almost 4,000, went through the 
advanced training center.
    But we have to do more. We have a 40 percent vacancy rate. 
I brought this up to Secretary of Interior Haaland, and you 
will be pleased to know Secretary Haaland identified you as the 
guy I should talk to. So I am talking to you.
    So tell me, what can we do to get more people through, 
Artesia, too, but certainly through the advanced training 
center, and get these positions filled?
    Mr. Newland. Sure, thank you, Senator. I would be happy to 
make sure we get the BIA's vacancy rate in the record. Before 
this hearing we went and checked. It was not 40 percent, it was 
closer, it was 30 or just under 30. Not where we want to be, 
certainly.
    Senator Hoeven. In North Dakota, we are authorized for 256, 
we have about 81. In the northern Great Plains, it is higher.
    Mr. Newland. I agree, Senator. With respect to training, I 
would love to find ways, as I indicated to Senator Rounds, 
would love to find ways to come up with all kinds of solutions 
on the recruitment and retention. I was honored to come and 
support the BADGES Act a few weeks ago before the Committee.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you for that.
    Mr. Newland. We will be happy to work with you on training 
opportunities.
    Senator Hoeven. Yes, let's make this a priority. I mean, 
there is a lot of things we need to do out there. But having 
more law enforcement on the ground, particularly where we can 
get folks to come from their home area and go back to their 
home area, that makes a big difference, everything from role 
model to understanding and knowing the people and all those 
things. We just have to do better recruiting, getting more 
people this training, and getting them back on the ground.
    So that has to be a priority, and my office will work with 
you, however we can accomplish that.
    The other thing I want to bring up is the SURVIVE Act. 
Essentially the point of that was to have a 5 percent tribal 
set-aside for the Crime Victim Fund. So I want to ask Director 
Randall, are you tracking tribal-specific, I mean, the whole 
idea was to make sure we help you tribal victim services.
    Are you tracking that? How is it going? What is working? 
What is not? What are your recommendations to improve it?
    Ms. Randall. Well, on behalf of my colleagues at the Office 
of Victims of Crime, I can say they are working so hard to 
ensure that funds get to tribes. They allow an interview 
process to complete an application. They have gone out to 
Alaska and on the ground even interviewed people to reach those 
funds.
    So I know that they are doing everything possible to make 
sure that those dollars get into the hands of the tribes.
    Senator Hoeven. Do you have any specific recommendations on 
what else we can do to help victims and make the program more 
effective?
    Ms. Randall. Overarchingly, the Victims of Crime Act Fund 
is incredibly successful. It faces some funding challenges, as 
you well know. I know that there are proposals before Congress 
to continue to support the health of the Crime Victims Fund. 
When I am out in the field talking with organizations, they 
tell me how much they depend on those Victims of Crime Act 
funds.
    Senator Hoeven. Good. Again, thanks to all of you for being 
here. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Lujan?

               STATEMENT OF HON. BEN RAY LUJAN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO

    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Director Randall, last month other members of this 
Committee and I sent a letter to the Department of Justice on 
declination rates in Indian Country, which in 2021 stood at 18 
percent. I appreciate that agency staff briefed us on this 
matter, but I fully expect a written response to all seven 
questions in my letter.
    Will you make sure that I get those responses in writing?
    Ms. Randall. Senator, I presume that we can get you and Mr. 
Schatz all of the answers in writing for everything that we 
have available.
    Senator Lujan. I like yeses and noes. Is the answer yes, or 
no?
    Ms. Randall. Well, I don't work on those, so I can't say 
yes. We will absolutely be taking it back to my colleagues at 
the Office of Legislative Affairs.
    Senator Lujan. Mr. Chairman, if I may?
    The Chairman. Please.
    Senator Lujan. This notion of the line of question that you 
asked for from the Administration to get that data back should 
not take a subpoena. We are talking about the life and safety 
of people that have been getting killed and murdered and have 
been ignored. Nobody sees them, nobody goes in. We see 
declination rates with prosecution and the best that we can get 
to getting answers to this from the United States Department of 
Justice is, let me look at this, let me think about this. That 
is not how the Administration should work with the Legislative 
Branch in the United States Senate.
    I don't understand this. I am going to get back to my line 
of questioning so I can lower my blood pressure, Mr. Chairman. 
I just don't understand why it is so hard to get a yes or no on 
we are going to give you what we have. The staff are answering 
questions; I want them in writing so we can hold them 
accountable.
    The Chairman. Senator Lujan, you wrote a letter to the 
Department of Justice, and they owe you --
    Senator Lujan. And other members.
    The Chairman. And they owe you an answer in writing.
    My question, just to be fair, my question was about data 
collection. I was assuming that Ms. Randall was hedging a 
little bit because she doesn't know exactly what data exists. I 
found it irritating, but at least explainable.
    But when a member reduces to writing a question or series 
of questions, it is not, ``I presume we will get back to you,'' 
but ``We will get back to you.'' There is a difference between 
the thing I was asking for and the thing Senator Lujan was 
asking for.
    Ms. Randall. I am certain that we will be getting back to 
you in writing.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Department of Justice is required under the Tribal Law 
and Order Act to submit a yearly report to Congress on Indian 
Country investigations and prosecutions. Is that one of your 
responsibilities?
    Ms. Randall. That is not one of my responsibilities, 
Senator.
    Senator Lujan. The last time the Department of Justice 
published covered data was from 2021. Are you familiar with 
this requirement to the Department of Justice?
    Ms. Randall. Yes, I have looked at that report.
    Senator Lujan. Has anyone shared with you when Congress 
might get the next report, since the last one we received was 
information going back to 2021? If I am correct, it is 2024 
now.
    Ms. Randall. Yes, Senator. That is in clearance right now.
    Senator Lujan. So the answer is soon?
    Ms. Randall. Soon.
    Senator Lujan. So I will assume that soon we will get that 
information. I appreciate that.
    Assistant Secretary Newland, I have heard from several 
Pueblos and leaders in New Mexico, when there are efforts to 
try to cross-commission tribal police, BIA officers, with 
sheriffs' offices and things of that nature, that it cannot be 
secured because of concerns of liability or things of that 
nature. I am assuming from the local law enforcement agencies 
that there is a limited liability for cross-commissioning of 
BIA or tribal officers.
    So the question that I have for you is, yes or no, are BIA 
638 tribal law enforcement officers and other Justice staff 
covered under the Federal Tort Claims Act for liability 
purposes?
    Mr. Newland. Are BIA officers? Yes.
    Senator Lujan. Are 638 tribal law enforcement officers?
    Mr. Newland. I believe so; I can confirm afterwards.
    Senator Lujan. The reason I am interested here, maybe we 
can all submit that in writing, is I want to provide assurance 
to local law enforcement agencies in New Mexico that in fact 
there is coverage. Because I share the same concern that Mr. 
Hoeven was just raising, and that members of this Committee 
have been raising, the lower numbers of law enforcement in 
communities. When I was younger, I remember cross-commissioning 
being an important tool. There was more of a presence, where 
everyone was working to keep communities safer. I felt safer.
    I am concerned now that there is some rationale that 
reduces that. So I am hoping that we can provide that certainty 
going forward, and if there is anything missing in tort law 
that maybe it is something we could consider, find some 
bipartisan solutions to this, and see if we can help in this 
particular area.
    Mr. Newland. We can get that to you, Senator.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate it very much. Thanks, Mr. 
Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Lujan.
    Vice Chair Murkowski?
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you. At the end of my round of 
questioning, I had asked, or I had encouraged, that there be 
this cross-pollination amongst agencies. One of the things that 
we know is that programs that may work in one department are 
models that we should be looking to.
    So in that vein, when we think about the 477 Program that 
authorizes tribes to consolidate Federal funding from across 
all the Federal agencies into one more streamlined program for, 
that is designed by the tribes, we se how that works. We are 
aware that DOJ recently transferred to DOI two discretionary 
grant programs as proposed by a tribe. And these were the OVC 
Tribal Victims Service set-aside and VAWA funds.
    We saw that in a letter to the chair of the House Natural 
Resources Committee DOJ stated that the department has 
concluded that ``In this circumstance, to transfer to Interior 
funds under the two discretionary grant programs.''
    So, Director Randall, do you agree that the Department of 
the Interior has the authority to integrate programs into a 477 
plan as mandated under that law? Do you think we have that 
ability to do that?
    Ms. Randall. Yes, Senator. Following 477 is very important 
to us, and something that the Department fully supports. The 
Violence Against Women Act has a lot of very specific mandates, 
and my office has not yet consulted on how, for tribal 
communities who are implementing VAWA, this will play out.
    So we are looking forward to some continued dialogue and 
consultation. I believe the National Congress of American 
Indians Violence Against Women Task Force will also be having a 
listening session very soon.
    Senator Murkowski. Again, the efficiencies that are 
created, we have seen them in play. That is what we are looking 
for here, as well.
    In another area, this relates to technical assistance, one 
of the things that Attorney General Garland had heard about, or 
we had raised with him, was this desire to ensure that there is 
culturally appropriate technical assistance that is available 
to the tribes. I have heard from some tribes who are accessing 
OVW funding that every program has a different technical 
assistance provider. Sometimes these providers have zero Alaska 
expertise.
    The FVPSA office, though, has provided funding to Alaska 
Native Women's Resource Center to provide comprehensive 
technical assistance to tribes and tribal organizations since 
2017. It works. This is a model that is comprehensive, it is 
flexible TA to the tribes in our State. People know that this 
is something that can work.
    I guess the ask is, is whether OVW can look to the 
successful implementation of what the FVPSA office at HHS has 
done, and pattern this. We need technical assistance for tribes 
and tribal organizations that really works, not just, call 
them, but you can't get anywhere.
    Again, I am encouraging the intersect here between your 
departments and your agencies.
    Ms. Randall. Absolutely. We have funded the Alaska Native 
Women's Resource Center recently for some Alaska-wide technical 
assistance, in addition to our awards for Alaska-specific 
special tribal criminal jurisdiction assistance.
    While the VAWA programs are incredibly diverse, covering a 
huge range of professionals, it is essential to us that that 
cultural specificity be there. When responses are culturally 
specific, they are significantly more effective. So we are 
committed to continuing to work on this.
    Senator Murkowski. Sometimes it is easier to have somebody 
be that assistance in some community somewhere else in America 
where they have no idea they are speaking to people who have no 
way out of a village, there is no road, the weather is down, 
and no resources, no shelter. I think what we have seen through 
FVPSA is a good model and I would commend you to that.
    Last question is for you, Assistant Secretary Newland. Our 
tribes are exploring some different ways to set up intertribal 
appellate court systems in Alaska and regional courts. We often 
work, you are very familiar with the tribal consortia 
throughout the State, and exercise of self-determination 
throughout.
    But if tribes in a region want assistance through the PL-
280 tribal court program to set up a regional court and the 
consortia then has a resolution that designates that authority 
from each member tribe, are you able to fund the consortia's 
request? If not, share with me what obstacles there may be to 
that approach. As you well know, economies of scale in so many 
of these areas are so important to the success of any program 
out there when you have these very, very small villages, again, 
who are kind of operating in a very independent way.
    Are we okay with the consortia model and being able to fund 
them that way?
    Mr. Newland. Madam Vice Chair, so long as there are tribal 
governments that agree to it, we ought to be. I don't want to 
misspeak here in the Committee and say yes, if the answer is 
no, because I know you would want to help solve that.
    So if I can follow up with an answer, I would be happy to 
get that to your team in writing.
    Senator Murkowski. I think your team behind you is nodding 
affirmatively.
    Mr. Newland. They are telling me yes. They know.
    Senator Murkowski. Okay, good. You make sure that he gets 
all that positive encouragement there.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Murkowski. Because again, this is what we are 
trying to do: We are trying to build some efficiencies, but 
that efficiency is going to come when we leverage the resources 
of everybody. So I cannot underscore enough how important this 
is for Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human 
Services, Department of Interior, and all the agencies and all 
the folks underneath, as we are working to build out a model 
that is unique to our region, unique to our State, working with 
different constructs than you are going to have from anybody 
else who is sitting up at this dais.
    Please, work with us, be with us, come to the State. We 
have lots of space for you this summer and even more during the 
winter.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you for the effort.
    Mr. Chairman, I think it is significant for this Committee 
to have had the level of participation that we have had on this 
issue. We have all raised different things, but we all kind of 
come back to the same thread: limited resources, what are we 
doing to make sure we are leveraging them. And the need is just 
too great.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Vice Chair Murkowski, and again, 
happy birthday.
    If there are no more questions for our witnesses, members 
may also submit written follow-up questions for the record. The 
hearing record will be open for two weeks. I want to thank all 
of the witnesses for their time and their testimony. This 
hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 3:58 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

Prepared Statement of Hon. W. Frank Adams, Chief, Upper Mattaponi Tribe
Introduction
    My name is W. Frank Adams, and I am the Chief of the Upper 
Mattaponi Tribe (``Tribe''). In January 2018, Congress enacted a law 
extending federal recognition to six Indian tribes located in the 
boundaries of the State of Virginia including the Upper Mattaponi 
Tribe. Our ancestors were the first people to encounter Europeans in 
North America. We have endured centuries of hardships at the hands of 
multiple sovereigns including the State of Virginia, but we never gave 
up in our fight for official recognition of the Tribes.
    Last year, the Upper Mattaponi Tribe adopted a new Constitution 
that includes a judicial branch of government. We have confirmed three 
highly qualified justices to the Tribe's highest Court. The Tribe also 
recently acquired its first Reservation trust land. The requirement to 
govern the Tribe's territory and people in a fair and just manner is 
now a reality for the Tribe.
Statement of the Issue: BIA Denial of Federal Funds to the Tribe for 
        Judicial Services
    The Upper Mattaponi Tribe, and all the other newly-recognized 
Tribes in Virginia, have been denied federal funding for judicial 
services--funding that it available to all other Indian tribes in the 
United States--simply because the date of the Tribe's recognition is 
more recent than other tribes that were federally-recognized years ago. 
Federal law requires federal agencies to treat the Tribe, and all 
tribes, in an equal manner, regardless of the date of federal 
recognition, including providing judicial services funds on an 
equitable basis. As a federally-recognized Indian tribe, the Upper 
Mattaponi Tribe is entitled to its share of federal funding for 
judicial services, and the Congress should appropriate funds for such 
purposes to the Eastern Region of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).
Testimony
    The date of a tribe's federal recognition does not dictate whether 
or not a tribe receives funding from the BIA. Federal law requires the 
BIA to treat all federally-recognized Tribes in an equal manner 
regardless of the date of federal recognition of the tribe. The Upper 
Mattaponi Tribe, as well as the other tribes located within Virginia, 
are entitled to receive those BIA judicial services funds provided to 
other tribes.
Law--Equal Footing (Thomasina E. Jordan Act)
    Congress enacted the Thomasina E. Jordan Federal Recognition Act 
(``Act'') extending federal recognition to the Upper Mattaponi Tribe. 
Section 303 of the Act expressly requires the federal government to 
treat the Tribe in the same manner as other tribes when it states:

         ''(a)(2) Applicability of Laws. All laws (including 
        regulations) of the United States of general applicability to 
        Indian or nations, Indian tribes, or bands of Indians 
        (including the Act of Jund 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.)) 
        that are not inconsistent with this title shall be applicable 
        to the Tribe and tribal members.

         (b)(1) In General. On and after the date of enactment of this 
        Act, the Tribe and tribal members shall be eligible for all 
        services and benefits provided by the Federal Government to 
        federally recognized Indian tribes without regard to the 
        existence of a reservation for the Tribe. (Emphasis added).

Law--Equal Footing (Indian Reorganization Act)
    All federally-recognized Indian tribes, like all recognized U.S. 
states, are on an equal footing. Federal law requires federal agencies 
to treat all tribes on an equal basis and on equal footing. For 
example, the State of Hawaii is treated the same as the State of 
Delaware even though Delaware is the 1st state and Hawaii is the 50th 
state.
    Federal law makes no distinction between earlier-recognized tribes 
and later-recognized tribes, i.e, once a tribe is federally-recognized, 
the exact date of such recognition is rendered moot. In fact, Congress 
enacted the 1994 amendment to the Indian Reorganization Act (``IRA'') 
to require all existing federal regulations, and all new federal 
regulations, to treat tribes on an equal footing basis. The IRA, at 25 
USC  1523(f) and (g), states:

        (f) PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF INDIAN TRIBES; PROHIBITION ON 
        NEW REGULATIONS.--Departments or agencies of the United States 
        shall not promulgate any regulation or make any decision or 
        determination pursuant to the Act of June 18, 1934 1 (25 U.S.C. 
        461 et seq., 48 Stat. 984) as amended, or any other Act of 
        Congress, with respect to a federally recognized Indian tribe 
        that classifies, enhances, or diminishes the privileges and 
        immunities available to the Indian tribe relative to other 
        federally recognized tribes by virtue of their status as Indian 
        tribes.

        (g) PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF INDIAN TRIBES; EXISTING 
        REGULATIONS.--Any regulation or administrative decision or 
        determination of a department or agency of the United States 
        that is in existence or effect on the date of enactment of this 
        Act and that classifies, enhances, or diminishes the privileges 
        and immunities available to a federally recognized Indian tribe 
        relative to the privileges and immunities available to other 
        federally recognized tribes by virtue of their status as Indian 
        tribes shall have no force or effect. (Emphasis added).
    Federal law and federal regulations are clear. Federal law applies 
to all tribes in the same manner, and a federally-recognized Indian 
tribe must be afforded the same privileges and immunities as other 
federally-recognized tribes. Federal agencies, including the BIA, 
cannot grant privileges to one tribe while denying the same privilege 
to another tribe, including the awarding of judicial services funds to 
some tribes but not to other tribes.
BIA Denial of Tribe's Request For Judicial Services Funds
    On September 21, 2023, the Upper Mattaponi Tribe requested 638-Self 
Determination Act funding from the BIA for the Tribe's new judicial 
branch of government. On December 18, 2023, after returning and 
redirecting the Tribe's request for annual judicial services funding to 
another BIA department, the Tribe submitted its third request and 
application for 638-contract funding for judicial services.
    In a January 4, 2024, letter to the Tribe, the BIA Eastern Regional 
Office denied the Tribe's request for Self-determination Act funding 
because the BIA Eastern Region, unlike other BIA Regions, ``. . . does 
not have a Tribal Court Program'' and has ``. . . no Tribal Court 
Funding''. The BIA Regional Director provided no further explanations. 
The BIA Eastern Regional Office directed the Tribe to request an 
appropriation of additional funds to the BIA, specifically to the BIA 
Eastern Region, for judicial services programs for tribes in the 
Region.
Conclusion
    The Upper Mattaponi Tribe is a federally-recognized Tribe eligible 
for federal programs and services like other federally-recognized 
Indian tribes, including funds to assist with the operation of the 
Tribe's judicial branch of government. Recently, the BIA denied the 
Tribe federal funds for its judicial branch of government simply 
because the federal government extended federal recognition to the 
tribe more recently, and that no funds had been appropriated for the 
BIA Eastern Region for such purposes.
    The Tribe worked tirelessly for decades to achieve federal 
recognition as an Indian tribe. The Tribe should not have to continue 
to fight for access to programs and services that are regularly 
provided to other Indian tribes, as we have the same needs for judicial 
services. The Upper Mattaponi Tribe has the same as other Indian tribes 
to protect its land and people, and Congress should provide judicial 
services funds to the BIA Eastern Region for such purposes.

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Jeffrey Stiffarm, President, Fort Belknap 
                            Indian Community
    Dear Chairman Schatz, Vice-Chair Murkowski, Senator Daines, Senator 
Tester, and Members of the Committee:
    The Fort Belknap Indian Community (FBIC) appreciates the Senate 
Committee on Indian Affairs dedicating the time and attention to these 
important matters of Public Safety and Justice Resources. The purpose 
of this correspondence is to provide the FBIC's written comment to the 
May 22, 2024, Oversight Hearing titled, ``Examining Public Safety and 
Justice Resources in Native Communities.''
    Hon. Bryan Newland, Hon. Patrice Kunesh and Ms. Allison Randall 
provided some key insights to these matters of Public Safety and 
Justice Resources in our Native Communities. There are several points 
from their testimony and the FBIC's history and experience that needs 
to be stressed and considered. In particular, we agree with Hon. Bryan 
Newland that our Public Safety and Law Enforcement are seriously 
underfunded and ill-equipped and more resources and funding 
opportunities are needed, We also agree with Hon. Patrice Kunesh that 
our Native Languages need to be funded. Due to many atrocities that 
have impacted out Native Communities our Native languages have 
suffered. Our children and grandchildren need the knowledge of our 
language and culture to restore the knowledge of who they are and who 
they come from. And we agree with Ms. Randall; the Not Invisible Act 
Recommendations need to be immediately implemented,
    The Fort Belknap Reservation is located in north central Montana 
and is comprised of 652.000 acres (1,014 square miles) almost as large 
as the State of Rhode Island, and has nearly 7,000 members living on or 
near our Reservation. FBIC has 638-funding for 9 Law Enforcement 
Officers to provide 24/7 Law Enforcement Services to our Reservation. 
Tribal law enforcement is seriously underfunded by the federal 
government and by BIA Officers lack equipment and are untrained to 
handle this crisis and most importantly underfunded. In the 638-
contracting process, the federal government offered $1.2 Million 
dollars to Fort Belknap to administer our own Law Enforcement in 1997, 
and 27 years later in 2023 offers $1.3 Million. Other similar Tribes to 
Fort Belknap, have been awarded over $5 million for Law Enforcement 
Services. Due to this incredible disparity, the Fort Belknap Community 
has a pending federal 1awsuit against the United States government due 
to its breach of contract and trust responsibilities owed to our 
People. The United States has trust responsibilities that is not being 
met in particular FBI and border patrol.
    FBIC is at War with Drugs and it deeply impacts our Public Safety 
and Justice Resources. On behalf of the FBIC, I offer 6 recommendations 
to Congress: (1) Fully-Restore Tribal Criminal Jurisdiction in Indian 
Country (2) Increase Funding for Law Enforcement, Tribal Courts, and 
U.S. Attorneys (3) Congressionally Mandate the Coordination of Federal 
Services (4) Secure the South Border of the United States, (5) 
Congressional Legislation for more sever federal punishment on drugs 
such as fentanyl and methamphetamine (6) Implement the 2023 Not 
Invisible Act Commission Report Recommendations.
    The United States Supreme Court's Oliphant decision limits the 
ability of Native Nations to try and punish non-Indians. Oliphant v. 
Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U.S. 191 (1978). Currently Tribal 
Governments across Indian Country do not have the ability to exercise 
criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians committing drug-related crimes 
in Indian Country. When a non-Indian commits a crime, our Law 
Enforcement is required to contact either the County and/or the FB[. 
Tribes need the ability to detain, arrest, prosecute, and punish all 
who come onto our Homeland and cause harm.
    A few weeks ago, we had a non-Indian Drug Dealer dealing drugs and 
living on our Reservation, In the course of a Tribal Law Enforcement 
investigation, this non-Indian Drug Dealer was found with a large 
amount of methamphetamine he had a scale, drug paraphernalia, had 
beaten a Tribal Member, and a history of committing other Drug crimes. 
The local County was called, as well as the FBI. Due to the on-going 
criminal behavior of this non-Indian Drug Dealer, the Tribal Court 
issued a preliminary Order to Exclude him from our Reservation as per 
the Fort Belknap Indian Community's Constitution. The non-Indian Drug 
Dealer violated within the week of the issuance of the Order.
    On May 22, 2024, our Tribal Council had an Exclusion Hearing to 
require the non-Indian Drug Dealer to be excluded from our Reservation 
indefinitely, During the Hearing, the non-Indian Drug Dealer stood 
before our Tribal Council and boasted: YOU HAVE NO JURISDICTION OVER 
ME. THE COUNTY MIGHT, THE FEDS MIGHT, BUT YOU DON'T. He further boasted 
that when he violated the Court's Order, he did so by driving onto our 
Reservation on a ``State Highway'' implying that our Tribal Council had 
no authority to exclude him because he was on a State Highway driving 
on our Reservation in violation of the FBIC's Order to Exclude.
    Drug Dealers and Drug Cartels have targeted reservation communities 
because of the rural terrain, history of community addiction, and 
limited law enforcement resources. Cartels are specifically targeting 
Indian Country because of a dangerous combination of under-resourced 
law enforcement, legal loopholes, sparsely populated communities, and 
exorbitant profits, and it is devastating Tribal reservations as well. 
Profits for these cartels soar the farther they get from the southern 
border. A fentanyl pill that costs less than $1 in Mexico and southern 
states, can go for over $100 on our Reservation.
    As the drug cartels seep deeper into Indian Country they know of 
the limited resources that we have. Montana is 147,040 square miles--
Montana is slightly larger than Japan. It is the 4th largest State in 
the United States behind, Texas, Alaska and California. In 2024, it is 
reported that only 20 DEA Agents cover the entire State of Montana. The 
DEA sends drug testing to their Crime Lab located in California and the 
test results are not known until at least 8 months or more--after the 
crimes are committed which also raises speedy-trial issues. The cartels 
know this--so it is easy for them to attempt take-over of reservations.
    On April 231 2024, our Tribal Council met Jesse Laslovich and 
Amanda Myers with the United States Attorney's Office. Fort Belknap 
Indian Community Council requested that Jesse Laslovich and DEA attempt 
to work With the Montana State Crime Lab in order to receive faster 
drug test results and more prosecutions. As to the Montana United 
States Attorney's Office, currently there are a total of 6 Assistance 
United States Attorneys (AUSA] in Montana. 3 are located in Great Falls 
(4 hours from Fort Belknap), 2 in Billings (3 hours from Fort Belknap] 
and 1 in Helena (4 hours from Fort Belknap), Two (2) of these 6 ASUAs 
are assigned to serve all of Indian Country in Montana: an 7 
Reservations! And the last federal budget cuts1 cut a proposed AUSA 
Prosecutor from Montana. We need more AUSAs not less.
    It was reported to our Tribal Council that prior to AUSA Jesse 
Laslovich's appointment in Montana, there was 1 violent crime case 
prosecuted from fort Belknap prior to his arrival, 3 violent crimes 
prosecuted the year he arrived, 11 violent crimes prosecuted the next 
year and it was reported that they currently have 7 violent crime cases 
pending prosecution. While the United States Attorney's Office attempts 
to meet with our Law Enforcement monthly, our Tribes very rarely see 
any FBI presence. There appears to be an ongoing disconnect between the 
FBI and AUSA and Fort Belknap Law Enforcement as to the evidence 
gathering and prosecution of cases. Our Law Enforcement reports crime 
to the federal agencies and yet we get limited to no feedback from the 
FBI as to the status of any pending case. On April 23, 2024, our Tribal 
Council made a specific request through Jesse Laslovich to have the FBI 
present at the Council Meeting Discussions and the on-going monthly 
case-staffing.
    Our Tribes are finding that the FBI is reactive not proactive. And 
this is frustrating. The FBI has jurisdiction over non-Indians, our 
Tribal L.aw Enforcement Officers' hands are tied because we only have 
jurisdiction over Tribal Members. So we get into a situation where if 
the FBI has jurisdiction over a criminal case and that person is not 
immediately arrested, the County Sheriff won't arrest because they say 
the FBI has jurisdiction. So the Suspects are not arrested and allowed 
to continue to victimize Tribal Members of our Community, Further the 
federal punishment is less severe with the federal-side for drugs than 
it is for the State/County Prosecutions. And the Border Patrol on the 
other hand cannot initiate contact with anyone that they believe may be 
illegal unless there is a local law enforcement agency that makes 
contact first and requests them. Which a]so slows the process when the 
Northern Border is within 40 Miles of our Reservation.
    The National Congress of American Indians authored a Report to 
Congress in 2006 which put the federal government on notice that drug 
cartels were moving onto the Reservations but they did nothing. The 
other federal government arm that fails us is the Border Patrol. They 
know Mexican or other illegal aliens are on Reservations but do 
nothing. Our People get harassed when they cross the Border with sacred 
objects even though our Border crossing rights are supposed to be 
protected by the Jay-Treaty, yet the cartel seem to be able to get 
right through.
    The Detention of our Tribal Members is administered by the BIA-OJS. 
Our Tribal Members are transported to a Detention Facility in Oklahoma, 
where they are detained with little to no contact with family. Yet, 
there is a +400 Cell Detention Facility in Hardin, Montana wherein the 
BIA Staffs it for 20 Inmates rather than the +400 capacity. What a 
waste of transportation costs to Oklahoma when our Tribal Members could 
be detained within the State of Montana. Further, the FBIC Court had to 
recently issue a Complaint against a BIA Detention Officer for 
subjectively releasing Inmates which violated Court Orders of 
Detainment.
    BIA Law Enforcement Training is located in Artesia, New Mexico, 
which is located 1,279.5 Miles away from the Fort Belknap Indian 
Community. If Law Enforcement Applicants are trained by State Law 
Enforcement Training, they are required to receive the additional 
federal training in Artesia, New Mexico. Our Law Enforcement 
recruitment and retention challenges are hard enough with the basic 
requirements of needing the Training. BIA needs to be on-board with 
finding Law Enforcement Training locations in the Great Plains Region 
or work with State Law Enforcement Trainings to implement federal law 
enforcement requirements.
    It is repeatedly reported to us that drug cartels are targeting our 
Native women and using homes on reservations as safe houses and 
distribution hubs. They are able to operate with impunity because of 
complex jurisdictional rules and the fact that Tribal law enforcement 
agencies have been under-resourced and under-staffed for decades. This 
problem is directly connected to our War on Drug Crisis, our 
communities are reporting more instances of sexual abuse, human 
trafficking, child abuse and domestic violence. And it creates an 
environment of a scary place of lawlessness. Why should we be afraid in 
our own Country? Congress funds billions in federal aid to foreign 
countries to protect its borders and to kill. The Fort Belknap Indian 
Community needs the funding to protect the Fort Belknap Indian 
Community's Borders in order to live.
    As recent as November 2023, the Not Invisible Act Commission 
Congressional Report, the Commission reported Indian Country's response 
to Congress regarding the lack of law enforcement, lack of federal 
coordination and cooperation with Tribal and Local Governments, the 
lack of training of Law Enforcement, lack of jurisdictional 
understanding, lack of jurisdictional coordination, and lack of 
funding. And the Commission developed specific recommendations Congress 
should implement. Fort Belknap Indian Community agrees with the Not 
Invisible Act Commission's recommendations and urges Congress to 
implement the recommendations. Congress and Indian Country have proven, 
through these Commission Reports, that in order to protect ourselves, 
Tribal governments need to have the financial resources and the ability 
to exercise Tribal Criminal jurisdiction over all People and all crimes 
that occur within our Reservations. (See also Commission Reports from 
the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 (TLOA) and the Violence Against 
Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA) of 2013 and its 2022 Amendments.)
    We cannot continue to allow cartels to take advantage of the holes 
in our justice system and we cannot win this War on Drugs by ourselves. 
I encourage you to do everything possible to ensure we have the tools 
and resources we need to keep our communities safe.
    In Conclusion, as recently as yesterday, June 4, 2024, during the 
Committee on Natural Resources Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigations Oversight Hearing. BIA Director Darryl LaCounte 
testified that the BIA is funded to meet 13 percent of Indian Country's 
NEED! 13 percent is NOT ACCEPTABLE. Nearly 100 Years Ago, Congress 
Passed the Indian Citizenship Act of June 2, 1924. Congress mandated 
United States Citizenship to all Native Americans born in the United 
States, Many of our Treaties--the Supreme Law of the Land--promised 
Protection of our People. By the promises of our Treaties and the 
Indian Citizenship Act of the United States: Congress has an absolute 
legal and moral duty to protect Us--and not at 13 percent. Congress 
needs to start with the legislative action to restore our Criminal 
Jurisdiction, and to provide the resources and funding to Protect the 
Borders of our Reservations and Tribal Homeland.

  Re: Funding for Tribal Courts to Ensure Access to Justice
Dear Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, Chair Simpson, and 
Ranking Member Pingree:

    On behalf of the American Bar Association (ABA), the largest 
voluntary association of lawyers and legal professionals in the world, 
I write to express our concerns over inadequate funding of tribal 
criminal justice that has contributed to staggering rates of violent 
crime and victimization on many Indian reservations. This is not a new 
problem.
    The underfunding of the tribal justice systems has been well-
documented in report after report for over two decades. \1\ Most 
recently, in 2024, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) submitted its 
Report to the Congress on Spending, Staffing, and Estimated Funding 
Costs for Public Safety and Justice Programs in Indian Country, 2021 
estimating that $1.5 billion was needed for tribal courts to provide a 
minimum base level of service to all federally recognized tribal 
nations in 2021. According to the same report, however, funding for 
tribal courts in FY 2021 was only $65.3 million.

Rights Act: A Report of the United States Commission on Civil Rights;

Funding and Unmet Needs in Indian Country; the Indian Law and Order 
Commission 2013 report A Roadmap for Making Native America Safer:

Report Not One More; and the Alyce Spotted Bear & Walter Soboleff 
Commission on Native Children 2024 Report The Way Forward.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Notably, the methodology used by the BIA to estimate the funding 
needs of tribal courts does not take into account an important recent 
Supreme Court decision that dramatically increased the caseload of 
tribal nations in Oklahoma. In July 2020, the United States Supreme 
Court recognized the inherent tribal jurisdiction over Native American 
sovereign lands in Oklahoma. In its decision in McGirt v. Oklahoma, the 
Court recognized that simply because a State encroaches onto sovereign 
Indian lands, that does not give the State authority to exercise 
jurisdiction to prosecute state law crimes in contravention of treaty 
provisions. As a result, tribal and federal courts and law enforcement 
must now devote substantial resources to criminal cases that had been 
heard in state court prior to the decision in McGirt.
    The ABA has long affirmed that tribal justice systems are the 
primary and most appropriate institutions for maintaining order in 
tribal communities. We have repeatedly urged the United States 
government ``to support quality and accessible justice by ensuring 
adequate, stable, long-term funding for tribal justice systems.'' \2\ 
Despite urgent pleas by tribes, tribal courts, and concerned 
organizations representing myriad disciplines for the U.S. government 
to appropriate the funds that are needed to provide the more than 350 
tribal justice systems with the resources they need to do this 
important work, there is a critical funding shortfall that needs to be 
recognized and rectified as we enter the FY 2025 budget cycle. The 
funding of tribal courts is an area of longstanding neglect and 
requires immediate attention.

    \2\ The ABA has adopted extensive policy supporting tribal court 
funding, accessible at: https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We understand that the Tribal Interior Budget Council \3\ and the 
Not Invisible Act Commission \4\ have both urged Congress to 
appropriate funding sufficient to meet the estimated needs of tribal 
courts. We, likewise, urge you to address this important funding 
priority and stand ready to assist you in whatever way we can.

                                 ______
                                 
    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Brian Schatz to 
                          Hon. Patrice Kunesh
    Question 1. Not One More: The Not Invisible Act Commission Final 
Report (Final Report) includes more than 20 recommendations directed to 
the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Per your testimony, 
HHS is planning to issue a formal response to these recommendations. 
What is the timing for issuing this response? Please provide the 
Committee with a copy of HHS' response.
    Answer. HHS is planning to issue a formal response to these 
recommendations at the later this summer and will provide the Committee 
with a copy.

    Question 2. In 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ)'s Office for 
Victims of Crime and HHS's Office on Trafficking in Persons partnered 
on a joint initiative to develop standards of care for anti-trafficking 
service providers. What is the status of the joint initiative?
    Answer. The Standards of Care (SOC) Technical Working Group (TWG) 
subcommittees have completed drafts of the first five themes: 
accessibility, cultural responsiveness, collaboration, organizational 
ethics, and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging. The TWG 
subcommittees are reviewing and providing feedback on the content 
drafted by their peers through July 2024. Once the review is complete, 
the themes will move forward to for collective opinion and feedback 
from panel members (utilizing the Delphi Process).
    This year, there have been two quarterly sessions with the TWG 
(March 5th and June 4th) where they discussed SOC themes and overall 
project progress. The SOC award recipient continues meeting with the 
U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and HHS federal representatives 
monthly. DOJ awarded a 12-month No-Cost Extension to the SOC award 
recipient which extended the project period end date to September 2026.

    Question 2a. In light of the Final Report's recommendation urging 
more collaboration across federal agencies to support organizations 
serving Native survivors of human trafficking and other violent crimes, 
is HHS developing other initiatives or other programs with DOJ?
    Answer. In April 2024, the Office on Trafficking in Persons (OTIP) 
within the Administration for Children and Families finalized a 
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with DOJ's Office for Victims of Crime to 
coordinate and enhance programs addressing child trafficking, including 
the Victims of Human Trafficking in Native Communities Demonstration 
Program. The MOA includes a commitment to:

  <bullet> Convene regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings specifically 
        focused on our agencies' efforts to combat child and youth 
        trafficking;

  <bullet> Engage OVC in the efforts of the National Advisory Committee 
        on the Trafficking of Children and Youth in the U.S. supported 
        by OTIP;

  <bullet> Identify opportunities to improve coordination and build 
        capacity of grant program services and assistance focused on 
        minors who have experienced or at-risk for human trafficking in 
        underserved communities;

  <bullet> Coordinate on the development and dissemination of training 
        and technical assistance for grant recipients serving minor 
        victims of human trafficking; and

  <bullet> Develop and disseminate resources to increase awareness and 
        educate the public about child and youth trafficking.

    Question 3. In April, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration (SAMHSA) issued a final rule allowing jails and 
prisons to treat inmates with methadone as appropriate to manage 
substance use disorder as a secondary condition, as long as they 
register as a hospital or clinic with the Drug Enforcement Agency. This 
rule will increase access to treatment for opioid use disorder in jails 
and prisons across the country. Are Tribal detention facilities 
captured in the rule? If not, how is HHS addressing treatment of 
substance use disorder in Tribal detention facilities?
    Answer. The flexibility described in the question and found in 42 
CFR 8.11(h)(3) of the revised rule is a restatement of existing law 
(DEA Hospital/Clinic designation to dispense methadone in accordance 
with stipulations outlined in 21 C.F.R.  1306.07(c)). 42 CFR part 8 
does not explicitly define a `correctional facility' nor the 
jurisdiction that administers such facilities. For questions concerning 
the scope of 21 C.F.R.  1306.07(c), SAMHSA defers to the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, which administers this regulation.

    Question 4. Existing resources available through the Health 
Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), including the Rural 
Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP-Overdose Response and RCORP-
Behavioral Health Care Support Program), promote healing in Indian 
Country by working to address substance use disorder and other 
behavioral health needs in Indian Country. How is HHS promoting these 
resources to Tribes and are they fully subscribed?
    Answer. HRSA is committed to promoting grant opportunities for 
which Tribes are eligible, including through regular engagements during 
the Secretary's Tribal Advisory Committee and the HRSA-specific Tribal 
Advisory Committee. HHS also promotes these resources to Tribes through 
HRSA's Office of Tribal Affairs' Monthly Newsletter communications and 
the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy's Weekly Announcements. We 
also promote these resources through the bi-weekly HHS Tribal Affairs 
Newsletter, sent out to over 6,000 subscribers by the HHS Office of 
Intergovernmental and External Affairs. Lastly, HRSA shares grant 
opportunities and other resources through partnerships with the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Tribal 
Opioids Response program and Indian Health Service's Division of 
Behavioral Health. The Rural Communities Opioid Response Programs are 
highly competitive and HRSA awards all available funding.

    Question 5. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF)'s 
Office on Trafficking in Persons (OTIP) established the Victims of 
Human Trafficking in Native Communities demonstration program, which 
currently provides funds to six community-based organizations, 
including Child and Family Service in Ewa Beach, Hawai`i. Given the 
reported success of the program, how does OTIP plan to expand the reach 
of this program to address human trafficking across Hawai`i?
    Answer. Within current funding, OTIP plans to disseminate the 
learnings from the program in Ewa Beach to inform the replicability of 
efforts in other localities.

    Question 6. In 2022, ACF's Family Violence Prevention and Services 
Act Program provided funds to Pouhana O Na Wahine to serve as the 
Native Hawaiian resource center on domestic violence. How has this 
funding strengthened the capacity of Native Hawaiian organizations to 
offer culturally-appropriate support to victims of family, domestic, 
and dating violence?
    Answer. Over the past eighteen months Pouhana O Na Wahine (PONW), 
the Native Hawaiian Resource Center on Domestic Violence, funded 
through ACF, has strengthened the capacity of Native Hawaiian (NH) 
organizations to offer culturally specific support to victims of 
family, dating and domestic violence.
    PONW's focus is dedicated to recognizing and restoring the voices 
and teachings of ka pae `aina o Hawai`i-O`ahu, Hawai`i, Maui, Lana`i, 
Moloka`i, Kaua`i, and Ni`ihau. Their goal is to address the 
foundational need for domestic violence intervention and prevention in 
Hawaii, ensuring their impact is felt deeply within the community and 
is sustained. PONW provides leadership and support by engaging with 
relevant social services systems and conducting research to help 
restore safety for Kanaka Maoli (Hawaiian) survivors and their 
children. Advocating for a Kanaka Maoli voice in the effort to 
eradicate high levels of violence against Kanaka Maoli victims is a 
critical component of their mission.
    PONW offers culturally relevant technical assistance and solution-
based strategies that are survivor-centered, trauma-informed, and 
grounded in Kanaka Maoli, values that are based on a Hawaiian world 
view. The organization's collectivistic approach factors into their 
resilience as Kanaka Maoli understanding that there can be many 
approaches to domestic violence prevention and response efforts. PONW 
recognizes and shares unique local histories tied to `aina kupuna 
(ancestral land) through the lessons from `ike kupuna (ancestral 
knowledge) of each community to build resilience and prevent domestic 
violence.
    PONW has developed a road map for Native Hawaiians organizations to 
provide culturally specific intervention and prevention strategies to 
address domestic violence in their communities.
Training and Technical Assistance
    PONW has continued to increase the number of training events held, 
the number of staff at Native Hawaiian organizations trained, and the 
number of responses to technical assistance requests. For instance, 
PONW developed a curriculum that is culturally specific and is offered 
across all islands in Hawai`i. These curriculum sessions were created 
by and for survivors and communities and are based upon the work of 
Native Hawaiian elders. These sessions, called Papa `Olelo, honor and 
create a space for everyone affected by domestic violence to come 
forward into a safe space to share their experiences. These sessions 
support Native Hawaiian organizations and communities to explore and 
promote culturally grounded responses that are specific to each unique 
community. Kanaka Maoli healing interventions have been used in these 
spaces to support participants. PONW staff have both behavioral health 
and Kanaka Maoli healing experiences and skills to support survivors as 
they address challenges to healing. Papa `Olelo session have taken 
place on O`ahu, Hawai`i Island, Kaua`i, and Molokai and is continuing 
on all Hawaiian islands. The sessions have been successful across the 
islands with new communities and Native Hawaiian organizations 
requesting new and additional sessions facilitated by PONW.
    The sharing of Kanaka Maoli practices reinforces culture as a 
protective factor for communities and individuals, as evidenced by the 
feedback received by partners and participants. Through sharing of 
Kanaka Maoli, PONW has helped to build the capacity of communities and 
Native Hawaiian organizations to address violence in ways that are 
specific to each community.
    In addition, PONW developed a training to connect with Native 
Hawaiian kane (men) who are survivors and/or have used violence in 
their relationships. PONW staff designed the training to share cultural 
knowledge of the practices and wisdom of a revered Native Hawaiian 
kupuna/elder who cared for the health and well-being of the Native 
Hawaiian community. These sessions emphasized self-care and self-
assessment exercises designed to build accountability to self and the 
wellbeing of the community. PONW continues to move forward by 
approaching domestic violence from a path not normally taken, by 
addressing the vast needs of, and by creating, finding, and providing 
solutions to increase safety for wahine (women).
    In 2023, PONW hosted a resource fair that allowed local agencies to 
network and build new partnerships. They co-sponsored a conference on 
Native Hawaiian culture, values and storytelling designed to end 
gender-based violence.
    Last year, they launched a three-part webinar series on Native 
Hawaiian health and its intersection with domestic violence as 
identified through Papa `Olelo and other community engagement sessions.
    As PONW continues to create space for conversation and collective 
sharing of the challenges caused by domestic violence, NH organizations 
and non-NH organizations seek out PONW to bring forth the knowledge 
they carry forward to shed light on the issues at hand and to open up 
opportunities to create solutions together. This reflects the concept 
of kakou, where each person of the unit has a function, has an 
honorable role. This could be within a community, an organization, a 
church, a club, and especially within the `ohana. This concept emotes a 
life of perpetual unity and harmony that is based on a foundation of 
Aloha. This has opened up further opportunities between PONW leadership 
and Native Hawaiian leaders.
Missing and Murdered Native Hawaiian Women and Girls
    PONW is involved in the Missing and Murdered Native Hawaiian Women 
and Girls Task Force in Hawaii and assisted in the research and 
development of the Missing and Murdered Native Hawaiian Women and Girls 
(MMNHWG) Report. The work done on MMNHWG in Hawai`i is part of the 
larger, Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) 
movement that originated on Turtle Island (the North American 
continent) in response to the disproportionate rates of violence 
experienced by Indigenous women. PONW has been a Task Force partner on 
the report since the Task Force was convened in 2022 and has been 
instrumental in the creation and dissemination of the first MMNHWG 
report that was released in December 2022.
    PONW has hosted and attended community awareness events to discuss 
the MMNHWG research process and findings and the applicability of the 
research to specific communities and agencies. PONW hosts the Missing 
and Murdered NH Women and Girls/MMIWG Week of Action in May of each 
year. MMNHWG research will offer practical tools such as checklists and 
recommendations to NH organizations and other service providers and 
professionals to respond to and prevent violence in communities. PONW 
is developing guidelines on program policies, screening tools, and 
promising practices to support NH survivors of domestic violence and 
families and communities impacted by intimate partner violence.
    The research for the MMNHWG is by and for Native Hawaiians and 
takes the methodological approach of community-based action research. 
Aligned with PONW's mission and vision, the ultimate goal of the MMNHWG 
research is to raise awareness about the various ways that Native 
Hawaiians experience violence and contribute, by way of advocacy and 
community awareness/education, to ending violence against Kanaka `Oiwi.

    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Brian Schatz to 
                           Hon. Bryan Newland
    Question 1. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)'s ongoing efforts to 
increase recruitment and retention of law enforcement officers include 
a pay parity initiative and wellness benefits. How have these ongoing 
efforts addressed BIA's double-digit vacancy problem?

    Is BIA filling vacancies at a faster rate than before its pay 
parity initiative?

    For 638 Tribes, is the agency doing anything similar to address pay 
parity for these officers?

    Answer. The pay parity initiative brings BIA direct service law 
enforcement pay levels in line with other Federal law enforcement; this 
change results in up to an additional $30,000 in annual salary for BIA 
law enforcement officers, as well as more robust career advancement 
opportunities. We have completed the process of converting current 
staff to the new pay levels, and openings for new vacancies are being 
advertised at this higher pay rate.
    The Office of Justice Services (OJS) is now seeing law enforcement 
officers return from employment elsewhere to OJS to work for Indian 
Country. As of May 2024, OJS has also retained about four more current 
officers than last year. OJS hopes the numbers will gradually increase.
    For 638 Tribes, the Indian Self-Determination and Education 
Assistance Act (ISDEAA) provides authority for Tribes to set their own 
pay levels. If Tribal programs choose to increase pay levels or employ 
the use of other recruitment and/or retention incentives, as OJS did, 
they have the discretion to do so through their own resources.

    Question 2. During the hearing, you testified that the President's 
proposed Fiscal Year 2025 budget would add ``over $30 million'' for new 
construction of Tribal detention facilities, which is enough to fund 
the replacement of a single facility. According to your previous 
testimony in the House of Representatives, 23 of the 96 detention 
centers in Indian Country are in ``poor'' condition. Assuming ``poor'' 
condition includes facilities that require replacement/new 
construction--What is BIA's existing process for replacing facilities 
in poor condition?
    Answer. BIA utilizes the Facility Condition Index (FCI) to identify 
facilities in poor condition. Once identified, the location enters the 
Indian Affairs, Public Safety and Justice (PS&J) Construction Site 
Assessment and Capital Investment (SA-CI) Program. The program 
implements a comprehensive approach to assessing conditions of PS&J-
funded facilities, based on empirical data, with an emphasis on 
improving detention, law enforcement, and judicial facilities. The 
program establishes a methodology for determining eligibility and 
selecting PS&J facilities for annual site assessments, third-party 
technical assessments, on-site reviews, recommendations, Facilities 
Investment Review Board (FIRB) review, and approved project planning.
    At the end of FY 2023, out of the sixty-five OJS facilities, 
twenty-three were identified as in poor condition. Of the twenty-three 
facilities in poor condition, we currently have full funding to replace 
five of them. We estimate the cost of replacing the remaining eighteen 
facilities to be over $600 million, which will be accomplished as 
appropriations become available. Currently, Indian Affairs is 
appropriated a funding level that would fund about one new facility 
replacement a year.

    Question 2a. Is there a replacement priority list, and if so, how 
is it developed? What are the criteria for identifying and listing such 
facilities?
    Answer. The replacement priority list is developed through the PS&J 
SA-CI Program, as described in the response to question 2(a).
    The Indian Affairs, PS&J SA-CI Program implements a comprehensive 
approach to assessing conditions of PS&J-funded facilities, based on 
empirical data, with an emphasis on improving detention, law 
enforcement, and judicial facilities. The program establishes a 
methodology for determining eligibility and selecting PS&J facilities. 
Criteria for identifying and listing such facilities includes, but is 
not limited to, the FCI, age of facility, life safety and health 
issues, facility intended use, inmate population, population trend 
analysis, proximity to healthcare facilities, and proximity to Tribal 
courts.

    Question 2b. What is BIA's long-term plan to address growing 
replacement and construction costs for poor condition facilities as 
part of future budget requests and communications with Congress?
    Answer. Facility needs are addressed through appropriations. The 
2025 budget includes a total of$51.6 million for Public Safety and 
Justice Construction, which is $5.6 million above the FY 2024 enacted 
amount. This additional investment will replace facilities in poor 
condition, expand employee housing, and address deferred maintenance 
needs.

    Question 3. In April, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration (SAMHSA) issued a final rule allowing jails and 
prisons to treat patients with methadone when registered with the Drug 
Enforcement Agency as a hospital or clinic. This rule will increase 
access to treatment for opioid use disorder in jails and prisons across 
the country. Does BIA plan to expand access to substance use treatment 
in BIA jails?
    Answer. Yes, we currently coordinate through the Indian Health 
Services Pharmaceutical Division for inmate prescriptions while in 
custody. We are developing a Memorandum of Agreement for the use of 
Narcan in BIA and Tribal jails with training for staff. The BIA OJS 
Pathways to Wellness Recidivism Reduction Initiative currently partners 
with SAMHSA in areas pertaining to screening, intervention, healing to 
wellness court treatment, and aftercare-re-entry. BIA OJS welcomes 
further opportunities to partner with SAMHSA and/or the Drug 
Enforcement Agency to make access to methadone treatment a new 
partnership.

    Question 4. Three commenters at the Committee's March 20, 2024 
listening session on Public Safety and Justice Resources in Native 
Communities specifically recommended establishing a Tribal Justice 
Advisory Committee to advise the Department of the Interior (DOI) and 
the Department of Justice (DOJ) on addressing public safety and justice 
concerns within Indian Country, including complex criminal 
jurisdictional issues. Such an Advisory Committee could assist the 
agencies in responding to the Not Invisible Act Commission's Final 
Report recommendations, including:

  <bullet> reviewing public safety budgets across federal agencies;

  <bullet> exploring how Tribal courts can be used by victims of 
        domestic violence;

  <bullet> advising on policies regarding communication among agencies, 
        providers, and advocates, and on ensuring communication with 
        families and Tribes is clear, accessible, and appropriate;

  <bullet> advising on the creation of a process for victim advocacy 
        and information sharing, centered around those directly 
        impacted by violence; and

  <bullet> advising on policies related to information access for 
        family members and victims (police reports, for example) and 
        appropriate return of human remains and belongings.

    Will DOI commit to working with DOJ to support such a committee to 
elevate Tribal interests within each agency and to advise on public 
safety matters, including how best to advance and implement 
recommendations included in Not One More: the Not Invisible Act 
Commission Final Report? Would DOI support legislation to create such 
an advisory committee?

    Answer. DOI would be supportive of such an effort, but it is 
important to highlight the current work DOI does with other federal 
agencies.
    During the 2021 White House Tribal Nations Summit, Secretary 
Haaland announced the formation of the Department's first-ever 
Secretary's Tribal Advisory Committee (STAC). The STAC ensures Tribal 
leaders have direct and consistent communication with current and 
future Department officials regarding intergovernmental 
responsibilities, exchanging views, sharing information, and providing 
advice and recommendations on Departmental programs and funding that 
impact Tribal Nations. Additionally, Tribal leaders are able to voice 
their priorities and concerns on the Public Safety and Justice 
workgroup through the Tribal Interior Budget Council, which works 
directly with DOI bureaus overseen by the Assistant Secretary for 
Indian Affairs.
    DOI also currently coordinates with the Department of Justice (DOJ) 
in a taskforce-like manner to address public safety and justice 
concerns within Tribal communities. In March 2024, DOI coordinated with 
DOJ to issue the Federal Response to Not One More: the Not Invisible 
Act Commission Final Report. In November 2022, the FBI and BIA 
finalized a new MOU to establish guidelines on the respective 
jurisdictions in certain investigative matters and for the effective 
and efficient administration of criminal investigations in Indian 
country.
    In July 2022, DOI and DOJ published a joint strategy (available at 
https://www.justice.gov/tribal/page/file/1553226/dl?inline) to prevent 
and respond to violence against Native Americans, including addressing 
missing or murdered Indigenous persons. This strategy underscores the 
agencies' support for the work of the Not Invisible Act Commission and 
a recognition that the Departments' work going forward will be informed 
by the findings and recommendations of the Commission.
    The Department continues to prioritize and reinforce Tribal 
sovereignty and self-determination by providing support and resources 
to improving public safety in Indian Country.
                                 ______
                                 
    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Steve Daines to 
                           Hon. Bryan Newland
    Question 1. Assistant Secretary Newland, Tribal leaders from 
Montana have indicated to me that while BIA detention facilities in 
Montana operate significantly below capacity, Montana Tribal members 
have been bussed as far as Oklahoma to serve jail and prison time, over 
one thousand miles away. Similar reports that Tribal members, upon 
release, have been forced to wait as long as seven days for 
transportation back to Montana are troubling. Does the BIA utilize 
facilities operated by county, state, or other federal partners if the 
nearest BIA facility is deemed insufficient?

    Does the BIA prioritize housing Tribal members in neighboring 
jurisdictions when the closest facility is deemed insufficient?

    Please explain the process and coordination between the BIA and 
county, state, and other federal partners in the decision to house a 
Tribal inmate in another facility if the nearest BIA facility is deemed 
insufficient.

    Answer. The BIA Corrections program has an operating procedure that 
addresses the inmate population and works to keep the staff and inmates 
safe and secure in a healthy environment. The process in determining 
placement is based on an inmate's sentence, medical condition, and 
release date. BIA Corrections also operates a transport program for the 
movement of inmates for certain locations and assists with long-range 
transports.

    Question 2. The 1975 Indian Self-Determination and Education 
Assistance Act, Pub. L. 93-638, requires the Secretary of the Interior 
to enter into 638 contracts with tribes who are willing to provide law 
enforcement which otherwise would have been provided by BIA at the same 
amount of funding the BIA would use if it were providing the service. 
Does PL 93-638 require the BIA to fund Tribal law enforcement activity 
based on a historical funding basis?
    Answer. A funding level is established for a Tribally contracted/
compacted program under ISDEAA when the contract/compact first 
incorporates the law enforcement function. When that incorporation 
occurs, BIA establishes a funding level equal to the current amount the 
Secretary would have otherwise provided for operation of the program, 
as required by the ISDEAA. This amount is commonly referred to as the 
Secretarial Amount, and it may be increased by BIA in subsequent years 
if additional appropriations are received. That amount cannot be 
decreased unless Congress specifically reduces appropriations for the 
corresponding BIA budget line item. Thus, a Tribe's Secretarial Amount 
can change over the years, but comparing Secretarial Amounts can only 
be relevant in the initial year. However, if a function or service is 
not currently being provided by BIA, then there are no funds available 
for a Tribe to contract/compact under ISDEAA.
                                 ______
                                 
    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Brian Schatz to 
                            Allision Randall
    Question 1. How many Assistant United States Attorneys currently 
serve Indian Country? Please provide the number and state/district 
locations for these positions.
    Answer. Given the broad scope of casework that each United States 
Attorney's Office faces, the majority of the Assistant United States 
Attorney (AUSA) positions provided to each USAO come with the 
flexibility to direct their efforts towards any type of casework that 
the office may face, provided that such casework is not otherwise 
prohibited. For this reason, vacancy rates for specific categories of 
casework are not available, as most AUSAs are not allocated for a 
specific category. However, across all USAOs and for all types of 
casework combined, our overall attorney vacancy rate averages 
approximately 12 percent.
    While vacancy rates for specific categories of casework are not 
available, we do track the quantity of AUSA workyears directed towards 
specific categories of casework. As it relates to Indian country cases, 
our latest records indicate that a total of 171 attorney Full-Time 
Equivalents (FTE) are currently serving Indian country in FY 2024. No 
vacancies are included in the 171 figure.
    Included within the workyears attributable to Indian country are 
the efforts of 51 Tribal Liaisons, with one assigned for each USAO 
whose judicial district contains Indian country. Tribal Liaisons are 
AUSAs who specifically focus on communication, collaboration, and 
coordination with the federally recognized Tribes within their 
districts. Tribal Liaisons, as well as Indian country AUSAs and other 
AUSAs, are responsible for prosecuting matters in Indian country.
    Tribal Liaisons positions are statutorily required and filled by 
AUSAs who are designated by the USAs. They assume responsibilities in 
addition to or as part of their regular work. As a result, there are no 
vacancies in the Tribal Liaison positions. If someone were to leave a 
USAO or stop serving as a Tribal Liaison, the USA would appoint someone 
else from within the office to serve.

    Question 2. In its Final Report, the Not Invisible Act Commission 
recommended increasing the number of Tribal Special Assistant U.S. 
Attorneys (SAUSAs) throughout Indian Country. In its response to the 
Final Report, the Department of Justice (DOJ) agreed with the 
Commission, but to date, eligible Tribal SAUSA applicants have been 
limited to seven Tribes in seven states even though DOJ ``encourages'' 
U.S. Attorney's offices across the country to integrate Tribal SAUSAs 
in their operations per the Monaco memorandum. How many Tribal Special 
Assistant United States Attorneys (SAUSAs) currently serve Indian 
Country? Please provide the number and state/district locations for 
these positions.
    Answer. Based on a recent survey of United States Attorney's 
Offices (USAOs) with Indian country responsibilities, at least 23 
Tribal Special Assistant United States Attorneys (SAUSAs) positions are 
available to serve Indian county, including positions that are 
federally funded and positions that are solely funded by their Tribe. 
Based on that survey, eight USAOs partner with Tribal communities to 
host these 23 SAUSAs: Arizona (15 SAUSAs, including one federally 
funded SAUSA funded under an Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) 
grant award to the partner Tribe), Colorado (one OVW federally funded 
SAUSA), Minnesota (one SAUSA), Southern District of Mississippi (one 
OVW federally funded SAUSA), Montana (two SAUSAs, including one OVW 
federally funded SAUSA), Western District of Oklahoma (one OVW 
federally funded SAUSA), Oregon (one SAUSA), and Western District of 
Washington (one High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area federally funded 
SAUSA). Some districts host more than one Tribal SAUSA. As noted above, 
multiple SAUSA positions are compensated through two DOJ grants, 
including the OVW Violence Against Women Tribal SAUSA initiative and 
specialized drug enforcement funding. Four of the OVW-funded positions 
in the list of 23 above are currently open (i.e., vacant) and in the 
process of being filled (Colorado River Indian Tribes, Southern Ute, 
Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, and Blackfeet Nation.) In 
addition, OVW plans to make four new awards under its Tribal SAUSA 
initiative in fiscal year 2024, which will support four additional 
Tribal SAUSAs. If these awards are made, USAOs will partner with the 
Tribal communities to fill the awarded the positions.

    Question 2a. What is DOJ's plan to integrate and increase the use 
of Tribal SAUSAs in Indian Country operations?
    Answer. The Department encourages USAOs to integrate Tribal SAUSAs 
into regular operations to increase the likelihood that every violent 
offense that is appropriate for prosecution is prosecuted in either 
federal or Tribal Court. See Memorandum on Promoting Public Safety in 
Indian Country from the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) to Director, ATF, 
et al. (July 13, 2022). SAUSAs complement the work carried out by 
Tribal liaisons and Indian country prosecutors in Indian country 
districts. The benefits of integrating Tribal SAUSAs include successful 
prosecutions of unresolved cases, stronger relationships between Tribes 
and USAOs, and victims coming forward with confidence that their cases 
will be seriously considered. SAUSAs, including qualified Tribal 
prosecutors and other qualified attorneys, may be appointed under 28 
U.S.C.  543 to assist USAOs in prosecuting federal offenses committed 
in Indian country. As indicated above, numerous districts with Indian 
country responsibilities leverage federally funded and non-federally 
funded SAUSA appointments, governed by a memorandum of understanding 
between the USAO and the participating Tribe.
    Since fiscal year 2012, OVW has administered its Violence Against 
Women Tribal SAUSA initiative, which was initially launched as a pilot 
project in response to requests from Tribal leaders. Beginning in 
fiscal year 2022, OVW has received annual appropriations to continue 
the initiative, which, since its inception, has awarded funds to 16 
federally recognized Tribes to help them work with their local USAOs to 
hire or retain mutually agreed-upon Tribal prosecutors to be cross 
designated as SAUSAs. These cross-designated prosecutors maintain 
active caseloads involving the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) crimes 
of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and 
sex trafficking in Tribal court, federal court, or both (OVW-funded 
TSAUSAs cannot prosecute non-VAWA crimes.) Cross-designated OVW-funded 
TSAUSAs help promote higher-quality investigations and better 
intergovernmental communication between Tribes and USAOs. Overall, the 
OVW TSAUSA initiative has achieved some notable successes, including 
enhanced collaboration between federal and Tribal partners and federal 
prosecutions of unresolved cases. On occasion, Tribal grant recipients 
have difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified candidates for OVW 
Tribal SAUSA positions, which has slowed or prevented expenditure of 
grant funds. In some instances, the OVW-funded Tribal SAUSAs have been 
hired by their USAOs, which may result in vacancies but demonstrates 
the development of a successful Tribal-federal partnership.
    In the absence of grant funding, USAOs coordinate and collaborate 
whenever possible with Tribal partners and appoint non-federally funded 
SAUSAs to assist with Indian country prosecutions. Depending on Tribal 
resources and Tribal court obligations, Tribes may be unable to cross-
designate a Tribal prosecutor or attorney as a SAUSA. In those 
instances, USAOs work collaboratively with the Tribal prosecutor's 
offices to ensure communication regarding Tribal and federal 
prosecutions.
    The Department appreciates the Committee's interest in the 
utilization of federally funded and Tribally funded Tribal SAUSAs in 
USAOs with Indian country responsibilities. Working in collaboration 
with Tribal partners and Department grant components, USAOs will 
continue to use and expand the use of SAUSAs whenever possible.

    Question 3. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Tribal Prisoner Program was 
made permanent by the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women 
(VAWA) Act in 2022. Recently, DOJ briefed Committee staff and shared 
that, as of May 2024, there are 49 participants from eight Tribes in 
five states--nearly half of the 100-person cap set by law. Does DOJ 
expect demand for the Program to exceed the 100 Tribal offenders cap? 
If so, how soon does the BOP expect demand to exceed the current cap?
    Answer. As of July 2024, there are 55 participants from eight 
Tribes in five states. Based on the increased volume in Tribal Prisoner 
Program applications and referrals received, and increased public 
awareness of the Program, BOP expects demand for the Program to exceed 
the 100 Tribal offenders cap in approximately 12 to 14 months.

    Question 3a. Has DOJ conducted Tribal consultation to improve BOP 
Tribal Prisoner Program access and participation from additional Tribes 
in more states? If so, how has the Department integrated feedback from 
Tribes, and what barriers exist to expanding this program to ensure 
Tribes in every state are able to transfer eligible offenders?
    Answer. DOJ held nationwide Tribal consultations on October 3 and 
6, 2022, to discuss implementation of the BOP Tribal Prisoner Program 
established in the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 
2022 (VAWA 2022). The discussions were extremely substantive and 
helpful to the BOP in both identifying unique considerations and 
refining the program design. The final report available on DOJ's Tribal 
Justice and Safety website provides a detailed summary of the BOP's 
response to ideas and feedback received during these consultations. 
Currently, Tribes in Oklahoma, Washington, Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, and 
Wyoming are participating in the Program. DOJ will continue to promote 
participation in this program. There are no barriers to eligibility--
Tribes in every state are already eligible to participate. However, due 
to the location of many BOP facilities, participation may mean that 
individuals placed with BOP may be located far from their Tribal 
communities, which is a concern for some Tribes. As with any adult in 
custody, BOP makes every effort to designate an individual to a 
facility as close as possible to the individual's release residence and 
community ties after taking into account a variety of factors.

    Question 4. Tribes have pointed to untimely notification from DOJ 
declining to prosecute concurrent jurisdiction crimes as negatively 
impacting their ability to undertake prosecution themselves. 
Specifically, Tribes have complained that such late notice has allowed 
the statute of limitations to bring charges and prosecute to run out. 
What is DOJ's existing process to timely notify Tribes of its intent to 
decline prosecution? If none exists, will DOJ commit to creating one?
    Answer. Consistent with 25 U.S.C.  2809, if a United States 
Attorney's Office (USAO) declines to prosecute, or terminates the 
prosecution of, an alleged violation of federal criminal law in Indian 
country, the USAO is required to inform Tribal law enforcement and 
prosecutors of the decision and coordinate with those officials on the 
use of evidence relevant to the case.
    The same requirements extend to law enforcement personnel if the 
investigation is not referred to a USAO for prosecution decision. See 
25 U.S.C.  2809(a)(1). All USAOs with Indian country responsibilities 
and law enforcement partners were reminded of their statutory 
obligations in July 2022. See Memorandum on Promoting Public Safety in 
Indian Country from the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) to Director, ATF, 
et al. (July 13, 2022). As noted in the DAG's memorandum, USAO and law 
enforcement partners were encouraged to promptly inform Tribal law 
enforcement and prosecutors of investigative and declination decisions.
    Each USAO is required to address coordination of prosecution 
decisions within their Indian Country Operation Plan. The timing of 
prosecution decisions is often dictated by investigation complexities, 
including witness cooperation, available forensic evidence, and 
available law enforcement resources. Therefore, USAOs regularly 
communicate, coordinate, and collaborate with Tribal law enforcement 
and prosecutors on investigations through either multi-disciplinary 
team (MDT) meetings or investigator meetings to provide case status 
updates.
    USAOs comply with their obligation to provide timely notice to 
Tribes concerning prosecution and declination decisions, as required by 
25 U.S.C.  2809. However, there is no Department-wide process or 
protocol governing such notice. Generally, USAOs are mindful of Tribal 
statutory limitations and strive to ensure prosecutorial decisions are 
promptly communicated and evidence is made available to their Tribal 
partners. The Department will explore and evaluate whether a 
Department-wide process or protocol is necessary to ensure prompt 
notification of prosecution decisions to Tribal law enforcement and 
prosecutors and considerations when providing notifications of such 
decisions.

    Question 5. A report issued by the Office of Inspector General in 
2004 recommended that DOJ meet with Tribes and the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs (BIA) to develop a strategic plan for jail replacement and 
renovation. Has DOJ met with BIA and Tribes to fulfill this 
recommendation? If not, why not?
    Answer. Since 2009, DOJ's Office of Justice Programs (OJP), through 
its Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), has consulted with BIA on the 
strategy regarding detention infrastructure projects funded under the 
competitive Tribal Justice System Infrastructure Program (TJSIP) 
solicitation. In response to the DOJ Office of Inspector General Tribal 
Justice System Infrastructure Program Audit (January 2017), BJA has 
worked with BIA to improve coordination to ensure that appropriately 
sized facilities can be funded, completed, opened, and fully 
operational. The coordination improvement effort included developing a 
formal agreement between BJA and BIA to document the roles and 
responsibilities of each agency, expectations of each agency, and areas 
of coordination as it relates to justice infrastructure projects. The 
formalized Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two agencies 
was executed in 2018 and continues to be in effect. BJA shares all 
TJSIP grant proposals related to corrections, courts, and law 
enforcement with BIA for review and comment. As part of this process, 
BJA ensures that there is adequate operational funding available to 
support new permanent facilities as well as the expansion or renovation 
of existing tribal justice facilities. Additionally, BJA reporting 
provides guidance for any BJA-funded projects to the submit design 
reviews and life safety review for facilities as appropriate. As 
memorialized in the MOU, BJA confers with BIA regarding significant 
changes to the TJSIP grant solicitation, participates in bimonthly 
federal partners meetings with BIA, collaborates with BIA on tribal-
justice related training events, works with BIA on efforts to 
operationalize justice facilities, and cooperates with BIA in other 
mutually beneficial areas as needed.

    Question 5a. Has DOJ developed a strategic plan? If not, why not?
    Answer. The 2004 Office of the Inspector General (OIG) report 
states Department of Interior (DOI) should work with BIA, tribes, and 
DOJ to develop strategic plans for jail replacement and renovation. 
DOJ/BJA has been responsive in our collaboration with BIA, as governed 
by the MOU, and documented in the response to the TJSIP Audit.
    As DOI indicated in the 2016 OIG report update to the 2004 OIG 
report, the DOI/BIA Office of Justice Services (OJS) continues to work 
with DOJ in providing guidance to tribes receiving planning, 
renovation, and construction grants as needed and/or requested. They 
further highlighted that OJS continues to work with DOJ on ranking of 
tribes applying for new construction and renovation.

    Question 6. In 2022, DOJ's Office for Victims of Crime and HHS's 
Office on Trafficking in Persons partnered on a joint initiative to 
develop standards of care for anti-trafficking service providers. What 
is the status of the joint initiative?
    Answer. In September 2022, under the OVC FY 2022 Human Trafficking 
Training and Technical Assistance Program solicitation, Freedom Network 
USA was awarded a cooperative agreement to work with OJP's Office for 
Victims of Crime (OVC) and HHS's Office on Trafficking In Persons 
(OTIP) to develop National Standards of Care for Anti-Trafficking 
Service Providers. The project consists of multiple phases. Phase 1 
``Project Planning and Research'' has been completed, and Phase 2 
``Drafting, Public Comment, Peer Review, and Publication'' has 
commenced. Phase 2 is anticipated to be completed in Fall 2026. OVC and 
OTIP also anticipate supporting future phases of this project 
associated with dissemination, training, and technical assistance 
(TTA), and implementation.

    Question 6a. In light of the recommendation included in the Not 
Invisible Act Commission's Final Report urging more collaboration 
across federal agencies to support organizations serving Native 
survivors of human trafficking and other violent crimes, is DOJ 
developing other initiatives or other programs with HHS?
    Answer. In April 2024, the Office for Victims of Crime finalized a 
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with HHS's Office on Trafficking in 
Persons (OTIP) to coordinate and enhance programs addressing child 
trafficking. The MOA includes a commitment to:

  <bullet> Convene regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings specifically 
        focused on our agencies' efforts to combat child and youth 
        trafficking;

  <bullet> Engage in the efforts of the National Advisory Committee on 
        the Trafficking of Children and Youth in the U.S. supported by 
        OTIP;

  <bullet> Identify opportunities to improve coordination and build 
        capacity of grant program services and assistance focused on 
        minors who have experienced or are at-risk for human 
        trafficking in underserved communities;

  <bullet> Coordinate on the development and dissemination of training 
        and technical assistance for grant recipients serving minor 
        victims of human trafficking; and

  <bullet> Develop and disseminate resources to increase awareness and 
        educate the public about child and youth trafficking.

    The Not Invisible Act Commission (NIAC) conducted several hearings 
throughout 2023 and the final report included a recommendation to 
combat violent crime against American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) 
people on tribal lands by providing tribes with information to enhance 
leveraging of federal funding to support all crime victims.
    The Office for Victims of Crime's (OVC) Tribal Division and the 
Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) have discussed strategies and 
activities to address how tribes can better leverage federal funding. 
In developing a plan to support Tribes on how to strategically make use 
of Victims of Crime ACT (VOCA) and Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) 
grants, DOJ's Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) and Office on Violence 
Against Women (OVW) recognized the need to include HHS's Office of 
Family Violence and Prevention Services (OFVPS), which administers 
funding for AI/AN victims of domestic violence and their families, in 
this work. OVC, OVW, and OFVPS formed a new working group to 
collaborate on the development of a searchable database to support the 
improved use of funding managed by all three offices.

    Question 7. Three commenters at the Committee's March 20, 2024, 
listening session on Public Safety and Justice Resources in Native 
Communities specifically recommended establishing a Tribal Justice 
Advisory Committee to advise the Department of the Interior (DOI) and 
DOJ on addressing public safety and justice concerns within Indian 
Country, including complex criminal jurisdictional issues. Such an 
Advisory Committee could assist the agencies in responding to the Not 
Invisible Act Commission's Final Report recommendations, including:

  <bullet> reviewing public safety budgets across federal agencies;

  <bullet> exploring how Tribal courts can be used by victims of 
        domestic violence;

  <bullet> advising on policies regarding communication among agencies, 
        providers, and advocates, and on ensuring communication with 
        families and Tribes is clear, accessible, and appropriate;

  <bullet> advising on the creation of a process for victim advocacy 
        and information sharing, centered around those directly 
        impacted by violence; and

  <bullet> advising on policies related to information access for 
        family members and victims (police reports, for example) and 
        appropriate return of human remains and belongings.

    Will DOJ commit to working with DOI to support such a committee to 
elevate Tribal interests within each agency and to advise on public 
safety matters, including how best to advance and implement 
recommendations included in Not One More: the Not Invisible Act 
Commission Final Report? Would DOJ support legislation to create such 
an advisory committee?
    Answer. DOJ is fully committed to working collaboratively, in 
partnership with fellow agencies and with Tribes, to further its 
efforts to promote public safety within American Indian and Alaska 
Native communities. The Departments of Justice and the Interior (DOJ 
and DOI, respectively) deeply value the input we receive from Tribes 
and Tribal organizations on how we can better meet their needs, and 
both agencies have established Tribal advisory councils to incorporate 
Tribal input and perspectives to discussions and decisionmaking at the 
highest levels in each Department. The Secretary's Tribal Advisory 
Group and Tribal Budget Council are the active advisory councils at 
DOI. The Attorney General's Tribal Nations Leadership Council (TNLC), 
established in 2010, is comprised of a group of Tribal leaders selected 
by Tribal governments from each of twelve regions across the country. 
The TNLC is charged with providing the Attorney General with advice and 
perspective on emergent and ongoing issues facing Indian Country as 
well as providing feedback on DOJ activities in support of Tribes in 
each region. DOJ holds monthly meetings with the TNLC. These Tribal 
advisory groups were established in consultation with, and with the 
support of, Tribal governments. They currently serve meaningful and 
valuable roles in each agency that meet the goals outlined in the above 
question. DOJ would support increasing opportunities for the 
established advisory groups to work together and would like to explore 
the possibility of jointly holding a portion of our meetings with DOI.
