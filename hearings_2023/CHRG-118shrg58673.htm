   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM 
             OREGON, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON FINANCE

    The Chairman. The committee will come to order. This 
morning, the committee welcomes Commissioner Werfel back to the 
Senate to discuss the IRS budget and this filing season, which 
of course came to a close yesterday. Let me begin by thanking 
staff at the IRS for the hard work that made this the smoothest 
filing season in many years.
    Democrats made a big investment in taxpayer service with 
the Inflation Reduction Act, and it goes without saying that 
now the American people have a right to know what they got with 
that investment. The numbers paint a clear picture.
    Last year, the IRS was able to answer 15 percent of the 
phone calls it got. This year, it was 87 percent. The IRS 
answered 2 million more calls and helped 100,000 more taxpayers 
in person. The return backlog is now way down. The technology 
upgrades are helping to get the refunds out the door more 
quickly. So these are real, concrete improvements.
    Now looking ahead, at the top of our agenda needs to be 
reducing the tax gap. This is money that is owed to American 
taxpayers and just has not been collected. The official 
estimate says that $540 billion of taxes owed go unpaid every 
year. Other estimates, including from Donald Trump's IRS 
Commissioner, believe that it could be $1 trillion. These 
estimates are so far apart because sophisticated, wealthy tax 
cheats excel at hiding in the shadows. The IRS cannot measure 
the lawbreaking because it does not have all the resources to 
identify it in the first place.
    So, the bottom line is pretty clear. You cannot get at the 
tax gap without focusing on these wealthy tax cheats and highly 
complicated businesses like large partnerships. That is what 
Democrats have sought to accomplish with the tax enforcement 
funding in the Inflation Reduction Act.
    The IRS plan for that funding came out a few weeks ago. I 
am sure members have a lot to say about it. It is clear to me 
that the IRS is focusing on the key issues that the law has 
subscribed to. The reality is, there are big challenges for the 
Congress to address: shoring up Medicare and Social Security; 
child care and education for families; paid leave for workers.
    Both sides have made it clear they want to address the 
country's fiscal health. Reducing the tax gap helps create the 
head room to be able to address those issues. If the first 
priority is making it harder for wealthy tax cheats to get away 
with breaking the law, the next priority ought to be to make 
tax filing season easier for everybody else.
    I think we all have heard from our constituents the last 
few weeks continued stories about how complicated it is, how 
much time it takes, how many forms. Why is all of this 
bureaucracy necessary? Now, the Inflation Reduction Act took an 
important step on an alternative. It is called free direct 
filing. It would provide another option for taxpayers and, 
colleagues, it is voluntary. It is something they can choose to 
have, a voluntary option when they are sick of the hassle and 
expense that comes with filing online today.
    There is a study underway looking at how to go about 
building such a system. Republicans and the tax prep lobby in 
the past have reacted as if this is just going to be pretty 
much the end of western civilization. There used to be 
bipartisan interest in building a free-file system that saved 
taxpayers money each year.
    Making it easier to file was a key component, for example, 
of the bipartisan tax reform proposal that I wrote with Senator 
Dan Coats a little more than a decade ago. His seat was right 
down there. We put together a bipartisan tax reform proposal 
that included a simplified system should middle-class folks 
want to choose it. And I am always, always, colleagues, going 
to hope that one day we can have another bipartisan proposal to 
include free-file, the kind of idea Senator Coats and I pursued 
for so many years.
    Unfortunately, these days too many Republicans are on the 
side of the big tax prep companies, the big companies that 
squeeze Americans for billions of dollars each year in various 
fees and markups. They have even objected to the organization 
that is conducting the free-file study.
    I am sure these legislators would prefer to have the tax 
prep lobby in charge of studying the issue, to smother it from 
the get-go. It has always been the same pattern each time free-
file came up. An army of well-paid lawyers and lobbyists 
descends on Congress to squash it, and too many Republicans 
stand there, right there with them.
    This must not be allowed to happen again. Democrats are 
committed to the proposition that it should not cost hundreds 
of dollars and many more hours of time simply to follow the law 
and to pay what you owe. When it comes to filing taxes online, 
the status quo is unacceptable.
    So these are some of the agenda items that Democrats are 
focused on, including reducing the tax gap by going after 
cheating by wealthy scofflaws, and making tax filing easier for 
everybody else. Those are our priorities.
    Here are some of the things we are seeing from the other 
side. When they talk about fiscal health, they are talking 
about giving billionaires a free pass to cheat on their taxes. 
It is in the proposals--in the proposals: billionaires get a 
free pass. Speaker McCarthy works overtime to rally Republicans 
around a plan that would gut health care and increase hunger 
among tens of millions of Americans.
    Apparently, if he does not get what he wants, he is willing 
to let this country go through a catastrophic default--and that 
is the operative word here folks: ``default.'' There is a lot 
of lingo about debt ceilings and all these kinds of things. 
What is really at issue is whether this country is going to be 
clobbered by a default.
    The Congress ought to take a smarter approach. That 
includes making sure the IRS can meet the needs of the American 
people and enforce the law when billionaires skip out on paying 
what they owe.
    So there is plenty to talk about today. I want to thank 
Commissioner Werfel for joining us again, and as always, 
Senator Crapo and I try to find as much common ground as we can 
on these issues.
    Senator Crapo?

             OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE CRAPO, 
                   A U.S. SENATOR FROM IDAHO

    Senator Crapo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
Commissioner Werfel, thank you for testifying this morning and 
also for your conduct in these first few weeks of your tenure. 
I hope you will continue to be transparent, accessible, and 
willing to work with me and my colleagues, particularly 
regarding support for taxpayer services and modernization of 
our outdated IT, which House Republicans passed in their bill, 
showing their support.
    While not the focus of today's hearing, the IRS's recent 
150-page response to Secretary Yellen's directive to deliver to 
her a 10-year operational plan for spending its Inflation 
Reduction Act funding requires comment.
    Secretary Yellen promised a plan that would allow the 
public and Congress to hold the IRS accountable for the 
project. While dense, what has been delivered is noticeably 
light on many essential attributes of a plan and will be 
extremely challenging to use as a document to hold the IRS, the 
Treasury Department, or anybody else accountable for missteps.
    A few things it almost entirely lacks include quantitative 
targets to measure against; backup data to analyze; and various 
key operational details including, for example, who at the IRS 
or Treasury Department is ultimately responsible for making 
decisions on any particular issue.
    It does not give any detail on how the IRS will implement 
Secretary Yellen's $400,000 pledge, and details really matter 
here. It also does not estimate what any of the 42 initiatives 
or 190-odd key projects are expected to cost or clearly answer 
the basic question of which initiatives or key projects can be 
fully implemented with the $80 billion in funding.
    What the document quietly admits is astonishing. Despite 
contrary rhetoric, the IRA did not give the IRS enough funding 
to fully realize the plan's vision, this despite having given 
the agency a slug of funding more than six times its annual 
budget. The IRS's annual budget justification goes further, 
asking for 15-percent increases in the IRS's discretionary 
appropriations in the short term for areas where the IRA 
funding falls short, particularly in taxpayer services and IT 
modernization.
    The IRS's annual budget justification also warns that if 
Congress fails to increase future IRS discretionary budgets on 
top of the $80 billion, and in particular spend even more for 
taxpayer services and IT modernization, the IRS's future 
service delivery will actually suffer. Finally, the President's 
budget requests still more IRS funding for future enforcement 
efforts--$29.1 billion more. That is on top of the $80 billion.
    Americans rightly have a hard time understanding how an 
agency provided more than six times its annual funding can 
still claim poverty, and given that the plan the IRS delivered 
is not transparent and does not allow for any meaningful 
accountability, this plea is essentially for another blank 
check.
    I have heard some argue that future uncertainty prevents 
the IRS from making firm estimates beyond a fiscal year or two. 
Indeed, that sounds like a tacit admission that circumventing 
the annual appropriations process for the $80 billion was a 
huge ``spend first, plan later'' mistake.
    But this ``uncertainty'' excuse falls completely flat when 
one observes the countless other examples of long-term budget-,
revenue-, and cost-estimating--both in the public and private 
sectors. When you last testified before us, you promised to 
regularly update the IRS's spending plan and solicit this 
committee's feedback. Based upon what has just been delivered, 
I strongly suggest you accelerate your timeline and return to 
this committee in short order with an actual plan.
    Returning to the subject of this hearing, my colleagues and 
I eagerly await discussing the IRS's annual discretionary 
budget request and current performance measures. I have learned 
more in the last few weeks about the sometimes-puzzling ways 
the IRS measures its own effectiveness, such as on answering 
phones.
    What I have learned would be more troubling if not for the 
hope that you will adhere to your promise to enhance the rigor 
and meaningfulness of the IRS's data collection and analysis. I 
recognize that you are only a few weeks into your tenure and 
are already facing momentous decisions that will likely have 
lasting consequences.
    I was encouraged by your commitments, which include full 
and prompt transparency, utilizing best management practices, 
making decisions based on sound and unbiased data, ensuring the 
IRS is strictly nonpartisan, not making any policy decisions 
that are Congress's responsibility, and turning to Congress at 
every possible opportunity for guidance and authorization.
    How well you adhere to these promises will determine the 
legacy you leave the IRS and the American taxpayers with, as 
well as your relationship with Congress. I urge you to walk the 
straight course and set a positive trajectory, and above all 
keep the IRS out of the partisan gamesmanship.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    [The prepared statement of Senator Crapo appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague, and as my colleagues 
all know, we will have further briefings this week on the 
strategic operating plan by Mr. Werfel, so we appreciate that.
    Our witness today is Daniel Werfel, 50th Commissioner of 
the IRS. He previously was a managing partner at the Boston 
Consulting Group. Before joining Boston Consulting, he was 
nominated to be Controller at the Office of Management and 
Budget, where he served for 4 years before becoming Acting 
Commissioner of the IRS in 2013. He began his career at OMB in 
1997. We welcome him.
    Why don't you go ahead, Mr. Werfel, and we will have 
questions.

  STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL I. WERFEL, COMMISSIONER, INTERNAL 
                REVENUE SERVICE, WASHINGTON, DC

    Commissioner Werfel. Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, 
and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to 
testify on the filing season and the IRS budget. I am pleased 
to report the IRS provided substantially better service to 
taxpayers during the 2023 filing season.
    We delivered a strong tax season for the Nation, the best 
in several years. Through April 7th, the IRS received more than 
101 million individual Federal returns and issued more than 69 
million refunds, totaling about $199 billion. IRS employees 
were able to make substantial improvements this tax season 
because of the funding Congress provided through the Inflation 
Reduction Act.
    This funding made a difference. It allowed us to hire more 
than 5,000 phone assistants, which led to a phone level service 
averaging 87 percent during the filing season. The average wait 
time on the phones was 4 minutes. This is a major improvement 
from last year, when service levels were under 15 percent and 
wait times averaged 27 minutes. Perhaps most telling was this: 
IRS employees answered 6.5 million calls to help taxpayers. 
That is 2.5 million more calls than last year.
    Improvements were seen in other areas. We increased face-
to-face visits at our Taxpayer Assistance Centers to 474,000--
that is up more than 30 percent from the year before--and we 
expanded digital scanning efforts to speed up the processing of 
paper returns.
    Providing a better filing season experience this year was 
an important step, but more work remains. The long-term funding 
from the Inflation Reduction Act gives us a unique opportunity 
to transform our agency over the next decade. Historically, the 
IRS received funding that allowed our staffing and operations 
to keep pace with the size of the U.S. population.
    In 2010, that changed. Cuts in annual funding caused IRS 
staffing levels to decline by nearly 17 percent, to less than 
80,000 full-time employees by 2022. While the IRS shrank, the 
U.S. population grew by more than 7 percent, reaching 334 
million. These reductions caught up with us. You could see that 
in the poor taxpayer service levels in previous years, 
including last year.
    We were able to improve this filing season by shifting 
Inflation Reduction Act funds over to our day-to-day 
operations. If we continue using Inflation Reduction Act 
funding this way, however--focused on short-term operations 
rather than long-term systemic improvements--we will not be 
able to transform the taxpayer experience, modernize outdated 
IRS technology, and deliver more effective enforcement of the 
tax laws as the Inflation Reduction Act envisions.
    The IRA funding was designed to restore IRS core operations 
and prepare the agency to serve the Nation in its future. But 
that work is outside of our base-level funding. That level of 
funding, which is $12.3 billion for Fiscal Year 2023, has not 
materially increased since Fiscal Year 2010. In fact, in real 
terms, we are 33 percent below our funding level in Fiscal Year 
2010 if we had just received inflationary adjustments. It is 
not enough resources to fund a tax system in an economy that 
grows in size and complexity every year.
    So I ask for your help to build on the remarkable progress 
we saw this filing season by supporting the $1.8 billion in 
incremental discretionary funding requested for Fiscal Year 
2024. This funding will enable us to maintain our current 
performance in the next filing season, while allowing us to use 
the Inflation Reduction Act resources as Congress intended: to 
modernize our operations so we can sustain and improve our 
service to taxpayers into the future.
    Our strategic operating plan lays out in detail our path 
forward, describing how we will improve all aspects of our 
operations. The plan, which I call our public ``to do'' list, 
lays out roughly 200 projects for improvements for taxpayers, 
tax professionals, and IRS employees that will transform our 
work on the phones, in person, and online.
    Inflation Reduction Act funding also gives us an important 
opportunity to improve enforcement efforts to promote fairness 
while respecting taxpayer rights. The agency will follow 
Secretary Yellen's directive not to raise audit rates above 
historical levels for small businesses and households making 
less than $400,000.
    I want to be crystal clear. We are not increasing audit 
rates for hardworking taxpayers making under $400,000. That is 
my pledge. There is no surge of new audits coming for workers, 
retirees, and others. We have plenty of other areas we need to 
focus on.
    Instead, we will build capacity to pursue high-income and 
high-wealth individuals, complex partnerships, and large 
corporations that are not paying the taxes they owe. We will 
use Inflation Reduction Act resources to hire highly skilled 
employees to address noncompliance among this group of 
taxpayers.
    I plan to provide regular updates to Congress and the 
public on our efforts to transform the IRS, and I would be 
happy to delve deeper into the details with committee members. 
For example, I will provide a supplemental document that 
provides, in one place, extensive details on planned 
expenditures over a 10-year period, and on hiring over a 3-year 
period.
    Within the next 3 to 6 weeks, I will be able to add more 
detail showing expected hiring across the full 10-year window. 
I am optimistic we can build on the accomplishments of this 
filing season.
    The question is not whether the IRS can improve service to 
taxpayers. This year, we proved that dramatic improvement is 
possible. The question is whether we can continue to improve. I 
am confident that we will continue this trajectory if we have 
adequate annual funding for day-to-day operations, coupled with 
the long-term resources. Combined, these will transform the IRS 
over the long term into an agency that taxpayers and the Nation 
expect and deserve.
    Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of the 
committee, that concludes my statement. I would be happy to 
take your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Commissioner Werfel appears in 
the appendix.]
    The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Werfel.
    We know in this country we have a tax gap of hundreds and 
hundreds of billions of dollars. This is money owed to the 
American taxpayer but not collected. Your predecessor sat where 
you are this morning not very long ago and said the tax gap may 
be as high as a trillion dollars a year, and he also said you 
are not going to be able to collect those monies, deal with the 
tax gap, unless you go after the very wealthy tax cheats.
    That is because--and you have mentioned this--the workers 
who have wages and salaries, we already know essentially a lot 
about them with respect to the taxes owed. It is these wealthy 
tax cheats--who can pretty much decide what they want to pay 
and when they want to pay it--that are the challenge.
    So my question is, a couple of weeks ago, the Senate 
Finance Committee completed a long investigation, finding that 
the big bank Credit Suisse violated a plea deal with the 
Department of Justice, where again you are seeing massive tax 
evasion by thousands of wealthy Americans.
    Our investigations team uncovered an ongoing conspiracy, in 
one instance involving a single family, of failure to disclose 
$100 million in secret offshore accounts. If that was not bad 
enough, the investigation found that Credit Suisse in total 
concealed from U.S. authorities 23 large accounts worth more 
than $700 million. And this kind of flagrant abuse, flagrant 
tax evasion, highlights the point that you and I have been 
talking about, which is that this ball game is all about going 
after these wealthy tax cheats.
    So my question to you is, Commissioner, how will the 
agency, the IRS, use the funding you have gotten to step up 
enforcement to crack down, for example, on the use of secret 
offshore accounts, something that is ongoing, by wealthy 
Americans? How are you going to use the funds to tackle that?
    Commissioner Werfel. Well, as I have said, Mr. Chairman, 
the enforcement funds in the Inflation Reduction Act will be 
focused to improve capacity in these areas of reviewing the 
taxes of high-wealth individuals, large corporations, and 
complex partnerships. It has been a place that we have been 
historically severely under-resourced to take on, and the 
Inflation Reduction Act provides much-needed resources for us 
to finally build the capacities that we have not had.
    Now, your point. Critical to doing this is, we have to ID 
certain patterns of activity where tax dodging is most rampant, 
and you point out, you know, offshore. You are not the only one 
to point this out. In a recent GAO report on the tax gap, they 
identified abusive tax shelters as an area where the IRS has to 
do more.
    So our plan is to build capacity, and that means subject 
matter experts, specialized accountants, data scientists, 
lawyers, all of who understand how these things are set up and 
can help us navigate them, and figure out where the funds are 
that should have been paid back to the Nation that have not 
been. And I----
    The Chairman. So you will go after foreign banks like 
Credit Suisse? And the reason I want to ask that question first 
is, Credit Suisse got busted almost a decade ago for doing what 
we found they have continued to do. In other words, they came 
to the Federal Government. Their CEO raised his right hand, 
promised 100-percent compliance, and then all of a sudden, what 
we found is, we are dealing with it all over again.
    So you have recidivists here, you know, people who have 
ripped off the American taxpayer, because it is those working-
class people who pay when the wealthy Americans get out of 
their obligations. And I think it is very important that the 
American people hear that when you are talking about a 
recidivist like Credit Suisse that promised that they would 
stop doing it and then continued to do it, I think it is 
important that we know those are the kind of people you are 
going to go after.
    Commissioner Werfel. Mr. Chairman, I am prohibited from 
discussing any individual taxpayer in a public setting.
    The Chairman. I am talking about the kind of action that I 
believe needs to be a priority. You do not need to go into the 
specific names.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes, and I was going to say lifting 
up--absolutely, the goal is to understand these patterns of 
behavior across these very complicated organizations. Because 
they are so complicated--large multinational corporations, 
complex partnerships--they have many divisions and subdivisions 
that are operating across different countries. They have 
different financial structures. It is a lot to unpack.
    The Chairman. My time has expired. And your last point, 
Commissioner, is very much on point, where you said the 
patterns are what is important. With Credit Suisse, the pattern 
was all there. Huge violations, huge violations. They enter an 
agreement with the government, and then basically, after a 
little bit of time goes by, they do exactly the same thing.
    So when you talk about patterns, it is exactly the kind of 
issue that Credit Suisse presented, because after they made all 
these grandiose promises in 2014, they just went back to 
ripping off American taxpayers.
    Senator Crapo?
    Senator Crapo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And, Commissioner Werfel, I want to start out with an issue 
which my colleague, Senator Wyden, raised in his introductory 
remarks, where we do have a big disagreement, namely whether 
the IRS should be the entity that prepares people's taxes for 
them.
    Some want the IRS to prepare tax returns for taxpayers, and 
several colleagues have actually introduced legislation in 
Congress to authorize the IRS to do that. The IRA gave the IRS 
$15 million to study such an outcome. That idea is concerning, 
and not just because of the apparent bias in favor of doing so 
by those who were selected to conduct this study, but for a lot 
of other reasons.
    Having the IRS act as tax preparer, tax collector, and tax 
enforcer raises significant conflicts of interest in many of 
our minds. It would incur billions of dollars in cost in 
development and would expose exponentially more taxpayer 
information to misuse or abuse.
    The private sector of this country already prepares and 
files free tax returns for tens of millions of Americans, and 
millions more of Americans are already eligible for that. The 
IRS's strategic plan has an entire initiative devoted to an 
IRS-run tax preparation program, which seems to me odd, because 
it's still being studied right now.
    The question I have for you is, has the IRS made the 
determination that it is going to pursue this, and if so, where 
does the IRS find its statutory authorization to do so or the 
funding allocated and appropriated to do so?
    Commissioner Werfel. Senator, no decision has been made on 
moving forward with a direct-file solution, and in large 
measure because of the point you raised. The Inflation 
Reduction Act mandated that the IRS produce a study for this 
committee and for Congress on the feasibility of such a 
solution. That study is due in mid-May. We are on track to 
complete that study.
    I do not want to jump ahead of the conclusion, because the 
study is not done yet, and so we are still working through. 
What we plan to produce will hopefully create an important 
dialogue between the IRS, the administration, and this 
committee on what the study says and whether it is feasible or 
not and what the various issues are, because you have raised 
some questions, and hopefully, the study will help us have a 
good dialogue on those questions.
    Senator Crapo. Well, can we agree that--I am glad to hear 
your answer, that it is not a predetermined outcome already. 
And can we agree that the decision is one that Congress can 
make, not the IRS independently?
    Commissioner Werfel. I am not sure of where the legal 
authorities are. I would--actually, I think it is a good 
question to ask in the context of issuing the report. The 
report really focuses on, operationally, what it would take to 
produce such a solution.
    Your question in terms of who has the legal authority is 
something I am not sure is within the scope of the report. But 
it is clearly an important question to ask on any go-forward 
basis.
    Senator Crapo. Well, I would tell you that I encourage you 
to recognize that Congress has the authority to make this 
determination.
    Let me move on; my time is running out.
    Senator Wyden also asked you about the tax gap. Have you 
done an analysis, or has the IRS done any kind of an in-depth 
analysis you can show us as to where the tax gap lies?
    And what I am referring to is something like what we have 
seen out of the Joint Tax Committee, that goes by income 
increment or cohort. Where is the tax gap--whether we can 
decide on what the amount of that tax gap is--where is the tax 
gap among people who live in the United States, or who are 
taxpayers?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes. We released our latest tax gap 
assessment in October of 2022. It covers years 2014 to 2016. I 
don't think we have time to unpack all of the rich content in 
there. I will say that it does give us a good roadmap for where 
to assess where there is a difference between the balance owed 
and the balance paid.
    One of the things that is important to understand is, we 
are constantly trying to improve the way we measure the tax 
gap, and when I was answering Chairman Wyden's question, when 
we have better capacity to assess, for example, high-income 
taxpayers, individuals, large corporations, and complex 
partnerships, we will learn more about how those financial 
structures are laid out and be able to hone more detail in 
terms of what the tax gap is in those areas----
    Senator Crapo. Well, thank you, and my time is running out, 
and I want to ask my last question, so----
    Commissioner Werfel. Please.
    Senator Crapo. I was very interested in your, again, making 
the pledge that you will not increase audits on those making 
less than $400,000. As you have likely gathered from my opening 
statement, I am concerned that the strategic plan did nothing 
to flesh out the details of this, and I do not have time for 
you to get into it today, but we know even less about what the 
IRS believes will happen to actual audit numbers for taxpayers 
making less than $400,000 than we did before.
    There is some kind of a historic rate that is being 
referenced. There is some kind of a pledge now, and a pledge 
from both Secretary Yellen and you. But we need to get details 
as to exactly how this pledge will be honored as we move 
forward.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes, sir. I am prepared to provide 
additional details, maybe in additional questions that are 
coming up. I know that we have a member meeting with me 
tomorrow. Of course, I understand that there's a request for 
more details, and I think the plan that was issued is robust. 
As you said, it is dense.
    Does it answer every question? No, and that is because we 
want to work with you to figure out what the questions are that 
we need to answer, to make sure that what we are doing is very 
clear in terms of how we are going to improve the IRS.
    Senator Crapo. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Cardin?
    Senator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Commissioner 
Werfel, thank you for being here, and congratulations on this 
tax season. You have triaged the IRS in order to deal with the 
necessary services to taxpayers, and you have done it well. I 
appreciate the point that you make, and that is, you need to 
have the ability now to invest for the future in regard to 
technology and workforce so that you can maintain that type of 
service level.
    One of my highest priorities for the IRS is to recognize it 
needs to be a customer-based organization. You need to be able 
to answer questions of taxpayers. You need to be able to 
provide those services. So I thank you for giving us the hope 
that we can in fact do that in a more acceptable way.
    I want to first acknowledge that our chairman and ranking 
member have been very sensitive to the concerns of small 
businesses. I chair the Small Business Committee, and we are 
going to have some joint efforts between this committee and the 
Small Business Committee to deal with the challenges that small 
businesses are confronting in regard to our tax code.
    As you know, small businesses depend very much on the IRS 
improving its customer services and improving its technology. 
So it will help--the investments you are talking about making. 
But small businesses do not have the same type of tax literacy 
that larger companies have, and they certainly do not have the 
personnel to deal with complexities in the tax code related to 
their business if they only have one or two employees and they 
are trying to struggle with the challenges of a young, new 
entrepreneur.
    So, I appreciate the discussion you had with the ranking 
member and chairman in regards to direct filing and the study 
that is being done. I would encourage you to also include small 
businesses, as to the impact it could have on our small 
business population, on trying to simplify the way that they 
can comply with our tax code.
    I would just point out that the authority issue is 
interesting, because we have not given you the authority you 
need to go after paid preparers. And one of the issues, 
particularly for low-income families is, yes, there is free tax 
service available, but there are also paid preparers that they 
are paying for, and we are not sure they are getting value in 
all of these circumstances.
    Unfortunately, we do not have the accountability that is 
necessary here. So I hope that your advice to us will be 
comprehensive, particularly how we can deal with low-income 
families and small companies in getting through our tax code 
more efficiently.
    Then lastly, we urge you to give us areas where you believe 
the tax code needs to be modified as it relates to small 
companies, because again, small companies are using the 
individual tax returns to deal with their taxes, and it is not 
as convenient as the corporate tax system is generally for 
larger companies. We need your help in making that a reality.
    So, just give me a brief reply, if you might, as to 
sensitivity in the work that you are doing right now, to help 
smaller businesses deal with our tax code?
    Commissioner Werfel. Thank you, Senator Cardin. I want to 
start out by just acknowledging that the point about the filing 
season that we have had, all the credit goes to the IRS 
workforce. I mean, I am fortunate enough to be here and talk 
about it and talk about their success. But it is just a 
remarkable group of employees who care so much and are so 
dedicated to this mission that we have, this critical mission.
    Senator Cardin. And please extend our appreciation. We 
recognize that. This is a stressful period for everyone, but 
particularly the IRS workers who are dedicated, who have stuck 
with the mission, recognizing the importance of public service. 
I agree with you.
    Commissioner Werfel. And I think the ranking member made 
reference to the plan as being dense--and it is--and I want to 
lift up what are the three main things that we are trying to 
achieve with the plan, and I think in doing so, I will get to 
your question about small businesses.
    First, we want to build capacity to do better customer 
service. That is the first thing. The second thing is, we want 
to build capacity to ensure that wealthy and very wealthy 
people pay what they owe. That's individuals, large 
corporations, complex partnerships. And third, we need to 
modernize the IRS infrastructure so we can better protect data 
and we can better automate our processes.
    So in all of the planning, those are the three things that 
I want taxpayers to take away. So, if you are a small business, 
based on what I just read and what I am committing to, our 
focus for you is improved service. It is not some wave of 
audits. It is improved service, and how do we improve service 
for small businesses?
    We have to meet them where they are. We have to help them 
understand their obligations under the tax law. We have to 
figure out how to put new solutions online for them, to make 
their journey easier. If they are paper filers, we have to 
figure out is there a bridge to get them to electronic files? 
Can we work to process their paper files more quickly so they 
can get their refunds and have tax certainty more clearly?
    So, if we can modernize the IRS, then we can also keep pace 
with how complex the law is and how it is changing, and we can 
meet taxpayers where they are more effectively. We just 
historically have not been able to do that because of the 
incremental and aggressive funding cuts that have happened 
since 2010.
    But the Inflation Reduction Act provides us an opportunity, 
and again, if you are a small business, our emphasis, our 
focus--what I am going to go to sleep at night thinking about 
and wake up in the morning thinking about--is, how do we help 
small businesses meet their obligations?
    Senator Cardin. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    Senator Cornyn is next.
    Senator Cornyn. Commissioner, is it not true that a tax 
credit or a tax subsidy, dollar for dollar adds to Federal 
expenditures, and in the case of a $31-trillion debt, it adds 
to the debt? In other words, tax credits are just another way 
for the Federal Government to spend money; correct?
    Commissioner Werfel. I think technically it is like an 
outlay or a spend with respect to measuring the deficit.
    Senator Cornyn. We talked a little bit about the Inflation 
Reduction Act. In addition to throwing gasoline on the fire of 
inflation, with $700 billion of additional spending and added 
to the debt, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act--this 
partisan bill, which was voted on exclusively by our friends on 
the Democratic side of the aisle, signed into law by the 
President--it lavishes rich subsidies for electric vehicles, up 
to a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles. I wanted to point 
out that contrary to the original estimate about how much this 
would actually cost in terms of outlays--it was originally 
advertised as being a $30-billion expenditure, and the truth 
is, it looks like it is going to be closer to $200 billion, 
6\1/2\ times higher than advertised.
    The President, as you know, has said by 2032 he wants to--
by his magic wand--say that two-thirds of all the vehicles 
being built will be electric vehicles, even though we now have 
280 million cars on the road, and almost all, except 2 or 3 or 
4 percent, have internal combustion engines.
    Added to that, we know that about 60 percent of the 
electricity that would be needed to charge those batteries 
comes from fossil fuels. Only about 22 percent of electricity 
is generated by renewables. And we know that, basically, this 
mandate and this expenditure, this lavish expenditure for the 
rich, would do virtually nothing to reduce carbon emissions.
    But I want to ask you about the supply chain. Seventy-seven 
percent of the batteries made in the world are made by China. 
We know they are on a path to increase their capacity to build 
electric batteries sevenfold by 2027. Is there any way that 
this mandate President Biden has ordered with the stroke of his 
pen, is there any way that it will do anything except increase 
the sale of 
Chinese-made batteries here in the United States?
    Commissioner Werfel. Senator, I do not know the answer to 
that question. What I do know is that what the IRS's 
responsibilities are, are to issue regulations and guidance for 
how these credits will be evaluated and who will be eligible 
for them based on a very intricate array of requirements that 
are in place.
    What we are doing now is issuing--we are on a path to issue 
regulations for comment. So the questions that you are raising, 
the tensions, the policy tensions that you are raising, will be 
fleshed out in the comments that we receive on the regulations.
    And then I will be able to come back and sit in this chair 
and be more illuminating in terms of what those comments are 
and talk to you about what those tensions are.
    Senator Cornyn. You will agree with me that those 
regulations are going to have to be consistent with what is in 
the law?
    Commissioner Werfel. Absolutely.
    Senator Cornyn. Okay. And actually the Inflation Reduction 
Act, misnamed I might add, actually provides a smorgasbord of 
credits for electric vehicles. For example, there's a $4,000 
credit for used electric vehicles in section 25E. There's a 
$40,000 tax credit for commercial electric vehicles; that's 
section 45W. And then there is a tax credit for fuel cell cars, 
which is section 30B.
    Do you know if these other credits have the same critical 
mineral and battery sourcing requirements as the $7,500 EV 
credit?
    Commissioner Werfel. Senator, I do not have that at my 
fingertips, but I can certainly provide you with information on 
that.
    Senator Cornyn. I appreciate that, because it appears to me 
that the American taxpayer will be subsidizing the purchase of 
Chinese-made commercial and used electric vehicles by virtue of 
these tax credits. So, we would appreciate your getting back to 
us with that information.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague. We are going to go to 
Senator Johnson, but I just want to say, as the lead author of 
this package of more than $200 billion in clean energy tax 
credits, we felt very strongly about the point Senator Cornyn's 
talking about, about batteries being made in China. The 
legislation--and this was at my direction--provides incentives 
for batteries made in the United States, and it was something 
we worked on for some time.
    Senator Cornyn. Mr. Chairman, if I can just respond 
briefly. It is not possible to meet that requirement, due to 
this constraint on supply chain and battery manufacturing. So 
it is either going to subsidize Chinese-made batteries, or it 
is an illusory promise.
    The Chairman. There are plenty of supply chain issues. The 
fact is--and I am going to go to Senator Johnson--it is 
something I happen to agree with about batteries being made in 
China. It is something that we took direct action to deal with 
when we were marking up that legislation. We want batteries 
made in the United States. We pushed to make that possible with 
the incentives.
    Senator Johnson?
    Excuse me, Senator Thune is next.
    Senator Johnson. I appreciate it, but I realized that.
    The Chairman. I am sorry for getting out of order. Senator 
Thune is next.
    Senator Thune. My apologies. I know how you love that, 
right, Senator, when people come in.
    Commissioner Werfel, welcome. Thank you for being here, and 
I know you are probably answering a lot of questions on this 
front. But at the confirmation hearing you said that you have 
dual priorities at the IRS, and I quote, ``equally focused on 
improving taxpayer services and improving the IRS's capacity to 
unpack complex returns.'' Now--and I appreciate and respect 
your aspirations there, but the funding priorities in the 
Inflation Reduction Act and the President's budget show very 
different priorities.
    For example, of the $80 billion provided to the IRS in the 
partisan IRA, more than half, or about $46 billion, is directed 
toward enforcement activities, and only 4 percent of the $80 
billion--and I repeat, 4 percent, 4 percent--was earmarked for 
improving taxpayer services.
    And President Biden recently proposed boosting the IRS 
budget by 15 percent, over and above the massive funding 
increase the IRS received from the Inflation Reduction Act. The 
President's budget would provide a separate, additional $29 
billion to the IRS for enforcement; again, in addition to the 
$46 billion for enforcement the IRS received last August.
    So, given the overwhelmingly disproportionate funding 
towards enforcement compared to taxpayer services, would you 
agree that some of the IRA enforcement funds could be more 
effectively spent on improving customer service?
    Commissioner Werfel. That is a good question, Senator. I 
think that we actually need funds to do both, and I worry that 
if we were to redirect funds out of one bucket into another, we 
would lose important ground that we need to cover in one 
particular area.
    And I say that--I know it seems like for the enforcement 
dollars, that there is a lot. The reality is that today, we 
have 2,600 staff who work on high-income, high-wealth 
taxpayers, individuals, corporations, and complex partnerships. 
There are more than 390,000 of those.
    So, 390,000 high-wealth, high-income taxpayers, 
corporations, individuals, and partnerships, and we have 2,600 
staff. A lot of these filings are thousands of pages, tens of 
thousands of pages, and some come in hundreds of thousands of 
pages. So every dollar we move off of our efforts to build the 
capacity to unpack those returns means, I think, we are leaving 
money on the table for the American people in terms of our 
ability to close the gap in terms of what is paid versus what 
is owed.
    Senator Thune. Well--and I do not dispute the fact that 
there probably could be some need for additional enforcement. 
It just seems like the way this skews--you think about 4 
percent for taxpayer services. You had, you know, 90 percent of 
the phone calls into the IRS were not answered in 2021, and I 
think it was a little better last year.
    And then you have this massive amount of funding infused 
into the enforcement, not only out of the IRA, but now also out 
of the budget, the President's budget, which we are considering 
and talking about here today.
    But I want to make one other point, and I think it maybe 
was touched on just now by Senator Cornyn. But in the Inflation 
Reduction Act, only 4 percent, $3.2 billion of the overall 
funds, go toward taxpayer service. The IRS Inflation Reduction 
Act strategic operating plan, which was recently released--more 
than 45 days late, I might add--proposes a total of $3.9 
billion for energy security, which includes $1.2 billion of the 
total allotment for taxpayer services.
    Now by energy security, is the IRS referring to an all-of-
the-above energy approach, including conventional energy 
production, or simply provisions related to green energy?
    Commissioner Werfel. The funds that we need are to 
implement the energy credits. It is a lot of work. There are a 
lot of customer service reps that we need. So for example, in 
the budget for 2024, we have asked for a $1.8-billion 
incremental increase.
    Part of that $1.8 billion is to fund about 1,200 new 
customer service agents and staff to help us implement the 
energy credits, because we are going to get a lot of questions 
coming in, and we are going to have to process additional 
applications for credits. So that is what that funding is 
talking about.
    Senator Thune. But as IRS Commissioner, what is a higher 
priority for you, delivering better taxpayer services, or is it 
advancing Green New Deal policies, which I will note are 
projected to blow past, way past initial CBO projections? I 
mean, is it taxpayer services or is it Green New Deal 
priorities?
    Commissioner Werfel. It is taxpayer service, and the reason 
is because----
    Senator Thune. Well, why doesn't the budget reflect that?
    Commissioner Werfel. The IRS's responsibility is to 
administer the law that is enacted by Congress. And so, we do 
not take policy preferences. We basically try to manage the 
portfolio----
    Senator Thune. I know you do not do that, but you do--you 
do have to prioritize. You have a certain amount of allocated 
resources.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes.
    Senator Thune. And what I am saying is, when 4 percent is 
going to taxpayer services, with the deplorable record the IRS 
has in responding to people across this country--I am all for 
secure and sustainable energy policies, but I am deeply 
concerned that the IRS has made more IRA funds committed to 
promoting the administration's radical energy agenda than for 
improving taxpayer services.
    And I know my time has expired. I am working with Senator 
Grassley on an IRS Funding Accountability Act, which hopefully 
will bring some transparency and accountability to this massive 
infusion of dollars and resources and employees the IRS now 
has. I would just really urge you to reconsider your 
priorities.
    The Chairman. Senator Thune, just very quickly, and then we 
will go next to Senator Warner. On this question that you 
started with respect to service and enforcement--and you and I 
have worked on so many of these tax issues over the years--I 
would just hope that we would not say these are mutually 
exclusive; we ought to do both.
    We desperately need to improve services. Our citizens are 
telling us that is important. But we also need enforcement, 
because that is what the tax gap is all about. If we do not 
enforce the tax gap, we will not get the money from these 
wealthy people. But I will look forward to the kind of 
proposals that you are going to be making, and I will always be 
willing to work with you.
    Senator Warner?
    Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for 
holding these hearings. Commissioner, it is good to see you. 
You do not look that much worse for the wear. Again, I think 
many of us on both sides of the aisle--regardless of whether we 
may disagree or agree with specific policies--are really 
grateful for your willingness to take on this job.
    I know the chairman's already mentioned this, but I want to 
commend the fact that we are working through that backlog, and 
we are going to have, I think, an efficient, hopefully, 
taxpaying season. I want to drill down on two issues, one which 
I have raised with you already and one that I have not.
    The first is--and this was the call we had in late March--
the Employee Retention Tax Credit, one of the things we put in 
place during COVID; again, a bipartisan piece of that 
legislation, which I think was well-intended to make sure that 
folks, that employers kept people on during COVID, rather than 
having to put them on unemployment.
    As I shared with you, you know, there are a number of 
businesses in Virginia--and I imagine this is probably the case 
in other States as well--where there has been a backlog. They 
cannot get clarity. They are not getting these tax credits 
which I think they deserve, since these were businesses that 
did, from a policy standpoint, what I think we all thought was 
the right thing, by keeping folks employed during that period.
    Can you update us on the overall ERTC backlog and where we 
stand?
    Commissioner Werfel. I can, Senator. Thank you for the 
question. And what I would like to do is just very quickly walk 
you through the situation, as I am finding it in my first weeks 
at the IRS, the actions that we are taking, and the results 
that I expect, or we should expect.
    So the situation is, the employee retention credit is an 
extremely complicated filing to process. It is paper-based. It 
is often coming through as an amended return, and you have to 
align resources across multiple tax years. So the staff at the 
IRS has a lot of work to do when these come in, to make sure 
they are processed correctly.
    Secondly, we see a lot of potential fraud and issues in 
terms of, you know, nefarious individuals seeking these credits 
when they are not eligible, or trying to dupe people into 
thinking that they are eligible, and they are not. So that also 
clutters. So that is the situation.
    The action is that now that filing season has ended, we now 
expect less calls coming in as people have--most of them have 
filed their taxes. We can redeploy people off the phones and 
reset, so that we are managing paper.
    Now, prior to this move of moving people off the phones, we 
were resolving about 20,000 of these employee retention credits 
a week using overtime and any down time when the phones are not 
up, moving people to do it. Like every resource, it is an all-
hands-on-deck situation.
    Post this filing season, now that we can reset the staff, I 
think we can maybe double per week the amount of credits that 
we are processing. So that is the action that we are taking, 
and in particular I want to make sure--and I have talked to the 
team about making sure--that we go with the older ones first, 
like those that have been waiting the longest, so you know, 
really focus on if it was received in 2022 or prior. Because 
they are still coming in, and under the law, they can come in 
until 2025. So this is a filing that we are going to be dealing 
with for years, but I think we are going to make progress.
    Senator Warner. How many--well, what you are saying is a 
great answer, but I also took away the fact that you are going 
to double per week the number of these that are dealt with, how 
many are being processed. How much of the backlog is being 
taken care of on a weekly basis?
    Commissioner Werfel. Twenty thousand.
    Senator Warner. Twenty thousand.
    Commissioner Werfel. Twenty thousand a week.
    Senator Warner. We can look at 40,000 a week going forward?
    Commissioner Werfel. That's the hope. That is what I have 
asked the team to do.
    Senator Warner. Okay. You just said it on the record, so I 
am going to hold you to it.
    Last question. You know, section 127 of the code has 
something that has again been bipartisan supported for years, 
which basically, as you are aware, allows an employer to go 
ahead and send an employee back to school to get additional 
education and that additional education, up to $5,250 a year, 
goes tax-free to the employee.
    Great retention tool, great ability to get additional 
skills. And my friend John Thune and I put a bill in that got 
broad bipartisan support--the chairman supported it as well--
that said if we do this on a going-forward basis, shouldn't we 
also allow those employees who have student debt to go ahead 
and qualify as well, and be able to let the employer pay down 
that $5,250 a year tax-free?
    We had it put in place for a year. It was extended to 2025. 
The take-up rate though--it seems like such a no-brainer--the 
take-up rate hasn't been great. What can we do to help further 
promote--and this is an area where, regardless of how we feel 
about student debt, you know, everybody is kind of all in, and 
it is, again, a great retention tool.
    I know I am over time, so I will let you--I will not say 
anything else, Mr. Chairman, but I would really appreciate an 
answer.
    Commissioner Werfel. Absolutely. So, as I mentioned, the 
three priorities of our work going ahead are to improve 
customer service, to increase capacity to assess high-income 
filers, and to build the backbone of the IRS so that it is on a 
more stable, modernized footing.
    That first priority is to improve customer service. In my 
mind, that is doing outreach. That is making sure that 
taxpayers are aware of the credits that they are eligible for, 
the benefits that they can participate in. I think there's an 
education gap of what is available, and then a sense of, well, 
the IRS is so complicated. Even though that benefit might be 
there, how am I going to navigate the tax laws to get there?
    These are two things that we have to close the gap on. We 
have to make sure that people understand what they are eligible 
for, and then we have to make sure that they understand that we 
are working hard to create a much easier path for them to 
navigate these types of rules--in this case, the benefit to 
them.
    The Chairman. The time of the gentleman has expired.
    Senator Hassan?
    Senator Hassan. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, 
Ranking Member, for this hearing. And, Commissioner, it is 
great to see you. I want to congratulate you on your recent 
confirmation, and thank you for testifying today.
    Mr. Werfel, before turning to my questions, I want to 
highlight the importance of remote notarizations for consumers 
and small businesses, something I just heard about from some 
constituents last night. As Commissioner, I encourage you to 
look closely at permanently extending the IRS's common-sense 
policy that makes it easier for families and businesses to use 
secure, remote notarization for tax paperwork.
    Now, on to my questions. Recent reporting has shown how 
emerging artificial intelligence technologies such as ChatGPT 
could be used to scam taxpayers by impersonating IRS employees. 
These AI tools could be used to quickly generate many well-
composed, convincing messages that trick taxpayers into 
providing scammers with personal financial information.
    For example, one cybersecurity expert used ChatGPT to 
easily generate a scam message on the employee retention credit 
that requested sensitive personal information such as Social 
Security numbers. So how do you expect AI tools to change how 
the IRS protects taxpayers from scams? Are the IRS's current 
anti-fraud programs well-suited to help combat scams that use 
emerging AI technologies?
    Commissioner Werfel. It is a great question, Senator, and 
we do have embedded in our operations tools, forensic tools, 
fraud detection, data, and analytics that have been 
strengthened over time. And I think, as I arrive at the IRS, I 
find it to be in very good shape in terms of our understanding 
of the portfolio of fraud that is out there and how we detect 
it.
    But we have more work to do, and in particular, this is 
fast-
moving. You know, this is like this--there is this concept of 
Moore's Law in terms of how exponentially these things move. 
This is why the Inflation Reduction Act funds are so important. 
I mean, it is the difference between us being underresourced 
and allowing these scams and AI and these emerging solutions to 
outpace us, or the ability for us to keep pace.
    Senator Hassan. Okay. And I would look forward to 
continuing the conversation with you about ways we can make 
sure that you are all in a position where you can deal with 
evolving threats.
    Commissioner Werfel. Absolutely.
    Senator Hassan. The National Taxpayer Advocate has called 
paper tax returns the IRS's kryptonite. Many of the frustrating 
IRS issues faced by my constituents are because of the backlog 
of unprocessed paper returns. The issues range from families 
who are struggling to get their refunds, to small businesses 
waiting for Employee Retention Tax Credit payments.
    How does the IRS plan to improve processing of paper 
returns, and how we will help our constituents stuck in the 
backlog?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes. So, a couple of things. First, 
scanning is a critical part of this, and we have really started 
to scale our investment in scanning solutions. We are scanning 
hundreds of thousands of paper forms now, and that just makes 
the entire process much quicker. I anticipate this--you know, 
we are getting better and better at it week by week, and I 
think we are going to start to be able to do a lot more 
scanning, especially next tax filing season, but also right now 
to deal with our backlog today.
    The second thing--and I mentioned this to Senator Warner. 
With the end of tax filing season, we need to start redeploying 
some of the people who have been on the phones, move them to 
paper processing. This is just good seasonal adjustment of 
workforce, and I anticipate that we are going to make 
substantial progress on some of the paper backlog as a result 
of just resetting where the employees sit.
    But there are other things that we can go into, and again, 
I go back to the fact that we have to make a decision in terms 
of what we want from the IRS. If we are funded at a steady 
level or cut, then all we can do is maintain our current 
operation. We have to make investments to deal with the 
complexity of what we see today.
    Senator Hassan. Okay. Well, thank you, and I have a 
bipartisan proposal that would use bar codes to make paper 
returns easier to process, and I hope you will look into that.
    One last thing before my time runs out. A recent report 
found that innovative partnerships between nurses and tax 
professionals can help first-time mothers fully access the tax 
benefits available to families. For example, through the Nurse-
Family Partnership, nurses have helped connect new mothers to 
tax filing information and tools which can help moms get 
benefits such as the Child Tax Credit.
    How does the IRS support new mothers in accessing tax 
benefits, and how do you think the IRS can best promote these 
kinds of innovative partnerships?
    Commissioner Werfel. I love the idea of partnering with 
HHS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to do more 
to figure out how we can support these types of individuals. It 
goes back to this significant priority of improved customer 
service, meeting taxpayers where they are, making sure (a) they 
understand what they're eligible for, but some taxpayers need 
more help than others.
    And if you are a new mother, if you are struggling 
financially in another situation, I want the IRS to have a 
better understanding of that portfolio of different taxpayer 
situations, and then better strategies for how to reach them. I 
think we can work with other Federal agencies to do it.
    Senator Hassan. Thank you very much.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    Senator Lankford is next.
    Senator Lankford. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Mr. Werfel, it 
is good to see you again. In the process, you have jumped right 
into the frying pan. There are a lot of things that need to be 
done, obviously, at IRS. I am grateful that you are engaging in 
this, but we are obviously lacking a lot of details--as you 
mentioned--on some of the plan, and you have said that some 
detail is coming on this.
    One of the things that you have--and I appreciate that the 
detail is coming, but we are tracking that. One of the issues 
that you raised was that we are not going to do audits or 
increase audits for those individuals and businesses with 
$40,000 or less, as per Janet Yellen's statement from Treasury.
    It is difficult for me to be able to track what historic 
levels may mean, because if I look back on it--and we have gone 
back to be able to look at what are the historic levels of what 
audits were done of $40,000 or less--some years it was very low 
and some years it was particularly high, statistically, on 
this.
    We do not know if that is a number, if that is a 
percentage, and if it is a percentage or a number, which year 
that that is. Is it going to be a group of years? Because if 
you say this is the historic level and then you look back 10 
years ago versus 5 years ago versus 15 years ago, that is a 
very different number. So help us with understanding what the 
words ``historic level'' mean.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes; thank you for the question, 
Senator. Just to clarify, the pledge is $400,000 a year, and 
what I believe--and the message I want to provide to you and to 
the American people--is that we are, for the next number of 
years, going to be so focused on increasing capacity for high-
wealth taxpayers, individuals, corporations, and partnerships--
and complex partnerships--that there will be no change to the 
most recent audit rate we have, the most final, complete audit 
rate we have, for years.
    And then, even once we feel like we have done the necessary 
capacity building in the high-wealth area, then it will take 
years to even get close to what might be a historical average 
versus where we are today. So, when I say ``where we are 
today,'' I want to make clear that we do not have a final audit 
rate for 2022, 2021, 2020, because it is still possible that 
there could be audits issued.
    So we will take the most recent final audit rate--and it is 
historically low, so it addresses some of your concerns that 
you raised in your question--and we will allow that to be the 
marker for at least several years, and then we will revisit it.
    Senator Lankford. So the historic level means the 2021, 
2022 audit rates?
    Commissioner Werfel. It goes earlier than that. It is more 
in the 2018-2019 range, because actually 2018 is now closed, 
and that is a final audit rate----
    Senator Lankford. Right.
    Commissioner Werfel [continuing]. Where in the other years, 
there is still the potential that the audit rate could change.
    Senator Lankford. Yes. I do not mean to pick on this, but 
this is an issue that we debated, actually on the floor, during 
the IRA debate, and Republicans actually brought an amendment 
saying it cannot include that $400,000. It cannot include that.
    The Democrats actually voted that amendment down and 
blocked it, and so this is why this is such a question now. And 
I know everyone is saying it will not be that $400,000, but 
there is nothing in statute that does that in defining the 
historic norm, and what that is seems to be a moving target on 
it. So that is helpful for us to get a clarification. So the 
2018 number is what it is going to be?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes.
    Senator Lankford. Okay. That is helpful to be able to get, 
and we will follow up on it.
    There are a lot of questions about the Individual Master 
File and some of the updating there in the technology. You and 
I have talked about that before, the issue of technology at the 
IRS.
    I have been in the Senate 8 years. Every single year I hear 
the IRS has legacy hardware and software, okay, and that is 
every single year. Now you are saying with the additional 
funding, you are going to be able to update all those software 
and hardware systems. Thank you for that.
    The issue on the Individual Master File, where does that 
stand in the process, because a lot of things are built on 
that.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes. Well, I think one of the 
priorities that we put in our plan is the desire to fully 
update the Individual Master File by 2028. I think the reason 
we need to modernize it is--a couple of different reasons. One, 
we want to make sure--and we think the American people 
deserve--to have the most up-to-date technology that is housing 
that data, so that it is as secure as possible.
    And then, obviously, with a more technologically 
sophisticated platform, we can automate more. We can do more. 
We can meet emerging requirements more quickly. The technology 
is not all old. You said there have been investments. The issue 
is, we have not crossed the finish line, and my goal is to make 
sure that we are not just updating this part and that part and 
not bringing together the full suite of solutions, so that that 
final solution is modernized and then it will be less expensive 
to operate and easier to update in the future. So it is a 
central priority for us going forward.
    Senator Lankford. I look forward to that.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    Senator Johnson is next.
    Senator Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Quick little comment. You know, if this committee would 
focus on, spend all of your time and energy on simplifying the 
tax code, stop trying to socially engineer through the tax 
code, a lot of these issues, a lot of these problems, would 
just evaporate, or would be a whole lot easier to tackle. So 
that is just my commentary.
    Mr. Commissioner, welcome. You are quoting statistics of 87 
percent response rate versus 15 percent last year. Where are 
you getting those numbers, because I have something completely 
different. Do you have the numbers to back up those 
percentages?
    Commissioner Werfel. We do, Senator. This is the same 
methodology, and we have used it for years.
    Senator Johnson. Okay. Well, please provide me those 
numbers, because mine are--the numbers I have, by the way, are 
last year 63 million calls, and you answered 21 million for 
about a response rate of 33 percent. This year the calls are 
way down. I think people just got discouraged. Twenty-six 
million calls and 16 million were answered.
    So you actually answered less, according to the numbers I 
got from the IRS. So I would like to figure out what that 
discrepancy is.
    Commissioner Werfel. Absolutely.
    Senator Johnson. Secondly, with $45 billion flowing into 
your coffers on enforcement, I am highly concerned about how 
you are going to keep partisanship out of your enforcement 
efforts. How do you make sure that enforcement is apolitical? 
We have examples of the IRS being weaponized, the Tea Party, 
targeting the Tea Party.
    The lack of enforcement, quite honestly--when we have 
emails showing Hunter Biden simply did not disclose income, we 
do not see any enforcement action. And the most recent, and I 
would say outrageous example of this was when journalist Matt 
Taibbi was testifying before the House Judiciary Committee on 
their weaponization of government.
    Basically, the day he is testifying, an IRS agent ends up 
showing up at his home. First of all, how common is that? 
Listen, I have filed a lot of tax returns, paid a lot of taxes. 
I have never had an IRS agent show up at my home or my place of 
business. I mean, how unusual is that to have an IRS agent show 
up at any taxpayer's home as kind of a first notice that you 
have an issue with your tax returns?
    Commissioner Werfel. So, first of all, Senator, I want to 
repeat something I said earlier, which is I am prohibited from 
discussing----
    Senator Johnson. I understand. So that is why I asked you a 
general question. What is the normal course of action for 
notifying a taxpayer if you are going to, for example, reject 
their tax return?
    Commissioner Werfel. So we have made it public for all 
taxpayers to see, what they can expect from the IRS in terms of 
when we might call you, when a home visit might occur. It is 
something that we want to make sure that the taxpayers have an 
understanding of, because there are a lot of scams out there.
    Mostly, if the IRS is reaching out to you, it is probably 
not the IRS. So we as part of our----
    Senator Johnson. No. So, I think this is pretty well 
documented, that an IRS agent showed up, put a note on Mr. 
Taibbi's door to call him in 4 days, which he did. They 
explained what the situation is. I find that unbelievably 
unusual, and I am asking you as IRS Commissioner, does that 
happen often? How unusual is that, that an IRS agent would show 
up at a taxpayer's home and tell him ``give us a call.''
    Now throw on top of that, an IRS agent showing up at a 
taxpayer's home as a taxpayer just happens to be testifying 
before the House Judiciary Committee on the weaponization of 
government against U.S. citizens. I mean, the chance of that 
happening is infinitesimal, but it happened.
    So, I am just saying in general, how often does the IRS 
show up as the first notice that there may be an issue or a 
problem with a taxpayer's return, and makes a personal 
appearance at that taxpayer's home? Is that part of your 
procedures? Does that happen very often?
    Commissioner Werfel. Again, I want to be cautious in my 
answer, to make sure that I am not violating a prohibition.
    Senator Johnson. That is fine. Talk in general. How often 
does that happen?
    Commissioner Werfel. I will talk generally, that if a 
taxpayer, if the IRS is reaching out to you directly, it is 
more likely the case that there has been some issue with your 
return. We have tried reaching you through less-intrusive 
means. We have been unsuccessful. We want to help and get a 
handle on why you may not have filed, on why you might have an 
outstanding balance due.
    Senator Johnson. You are doing--you are not answering my 
question in terms of how often that would happen. My time is 
running out, so all I can say is, I know Chairman Jordan has 
sent you and Secretary Yellen a letter requesting all the 
information on that. I will be sending you a similar letter.
    I would like it if the chairman would join me in that 
letter to get this information, because this is very troubling, 
to have the IRS take that type of action. Again, the chances 
are so infinitesimally small, that an IRS agent would show up 
at a journalist's door the day that journalist is testifying 
before a House Committee.
    So, I am also going to be requesting that all the 
documentation, all the information on that specific case--I 
believe Mr. Taibbi has already issued a waiver for the IRS to 
provide that information. So, I am asking, will you comply with 
that, those requests for you to turn that information over to 
myself and to Chairman Jordan?
    Commissioner Werfel. As long as we can do it consistent 
with section 6103, yes.
    Senator Johnson. Okay; thank you.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    Senator Blackburn is next.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome 
back to us. Just tacking on to what Senator Johnson was saying, 
I think it is important to note, with the Lois Lerner scandals 
and targeting that took place at the IRS--you are very familiar 
with that because you were brought in to help clean that up.
    And when there's the perception that people are being 
targeted and there is anecdotal evidence and that information 
makes it to us, it does mean that we need to question you about 
this, and you know what a debacle that was during Ms. Lerner's 
time.
    I want to return to where I was with you in the first 
hearing, and we talked about the SITCA and the $400,000 limit, 
how you were going to be able to put that in place and not have 
it affect people who have tip income that are actually making 
less than $400,000 a year.
    And as we discussed, I do not think you were able to give 
me an example of someone you knew or any profession you knew 
that would make $400,000 a year that was working for tips. So 
if that IRS enforcement focus is on taxpayers who are making 
$400,000, then how do you justify this SITCA program, and how 
are you going to handle this so that it does not become a 
mandate on employers?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes. I appreciate the question, and 
again, I think it is absolutely the case, and I want to 
reaffirm, that those individuals who are making less than 
$400,000 will see no new wave of audits or no increase in the 
audit rate, as I have described earlier in this hearing. On the 
question of----
    Senator Blackburn. But you will be increasing their taxes?
    Commissioner Werfel. This is a question where I think we 
need to do better outreach with the associations, restaurants, 
tipped workers, to make sure that we are getting better 
aligned----
    Senator Blackburn. Is your goal to make the program 
mandatory? Right now, it's voluntary. Are you trying to make 
this mandatory?
    Commissioner Werfel. I have no intention----
    Senator Blackburn. No intention; okay.
    Let me move on. You talked earlier about the historical 
rate of audits, but previously you had said--you and Yellen had 
each said that you were not going to raise taxes. The President 
has said no one making under $400,000 a year is going to see 
their taxes raised.
    So now that has changed to no more than historical levels. 
So if you will, give us in writing how you are couching that. 
Is it 5-year levels, is it 10-year levels? Is it going back to 
2018 and setting it there? Was that a high mark, was it a low 
mark? I think there needs to be a little bit more clarity on 
that, and I would also like to hear from you, because this is 
causing great confusion.
    How do you calculate the $400,000? How are you--is it based 
on adjusted gross? Is it based on the net? How are you arriving 
at this number? And the reason I ask this, Commissioner, is 
because Tennessee is a very entrepreneurial State, and as you 
know, we have a lot of people in the music industry.
    We have a lot of people who do tours, who work with these 
tours. They are self-employed. They are independent 
contractors, and while they may have a higher gross, their net 
is very low. So it is important to have definition around what 
do you mean--what is $400,000? Gross, adjusted gross, net? 
Where are you pegging that?
    Commissioner Werfel. Okay. So on that question, we are 
going to look at total positive income as our metric. So, if 
the return comes in and the total positive income on the return 
is under $400,000, then we will know that it is in a segment of 
population that would receive no----
    Senator Blackburn. Does that increase their audit rate?
    Commissioner Werfel. No; that is the point. There would be 
no increased likelihood of an audit if they have less than 
$400,000 in total positive income.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. Let us go back to the issue we 
previously discussed about teleworking, and I know that Senator 
Thune talked a little bit about the phones not being answered, 
which is something that we hear quite a bit. You have a heavy 
lift to go, and I would love to know what percentage of your 
employees are currently in the office working and how many are 
teleworking, and are you pulling that VPN data and auditing 
that?
    That is what you ought to be auditing, to see if they are 
actually conducting business, logged in working, or if they are 
asleep on the job.
    Commissioner Werfel. Senator, let me, let me offer you 
this. First of all, I want to clarify. All employees are 
working. In my first few weeks at the IRS, I focused my 
questions as follows. Are we answering the calls, and we 
answered 87 percent. Are we in our Taxpayer Assistance Centers, 
in our walk-in centers, keeping the lines short, meeting all of 
our appointments, and we are. Are we making progress on 
processing the paper backlog? We are. Are we defending 
cyberattacks, and we defend a billion cyberattacks successfully 
a year. I understand the question. I think also OMB just issued 
guidance last week on telework, so I am going to now turn to 
that and figure out how to make sure that the IRS is aligned 
with the rest of the government.
    But I would say that the success we had with the filing 
season was the most important metric for me to start with, 
before I got into the details of where someone might be 
working.
    The Chairman. The time of the gentlelady has expired.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I just want to say, because we are getting 
ready to make sure that everybody gets a chance to ask 
questions, the program Senator Blackburn has been talking 
about, a small business program, is voluntary, and I want to 
assure colleagues, as long as I am chairman of this committee, 
it will not be mandatory, period, full stop. It will not be 
mandatory.
    Senator Bennet?
    Senator Bennet. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very 
much for being here. We really appreciate your service.
    During your confirmation hearing, I raised concerns about 
how the IRS considered taxing Colorado's State tax refund, 
which we call TABOR refunds. I also sent a letter out about 
this yesterday.
    As you may remember, the IRS notified Colorado taxpayers in 
the middle of filing season, right when people were filing 
their taxes, that it could tax their TABOR refund. In 30 years, 
the IRS has never done that before, and in February, the IRS 
issued guidance saying it would not tax TABOR refunds for the 
2022 tax year, which we appreciate.
    But the guidance also opened the door to tax these refunds 
in the future. In the fine print, the IRS groups State tax 
payments into two categories. The first category was State tax 
refunds which the IRS almost never taxes, and the secondary 
category was general welfare and disaster relief payments, 
which the IRS is more likely to tax down the road.
    And for reasons that I still cannot understand, the IRS put 
Colorado's TABOR funds in the second category. I think that the 
TABOR refund should have been placed in the first category. 
They are State tax refunds. This is how the IRS has treated 
them for 30 years.
    TABOR refunds only go out, as I think you know, 
Commissioner, to Coloradans when the State collects more in 
taxes than we allow in State law. It is a tax refund. It is not 
a form of income, and it has been treated that way for 3 
decades.
    During your confirmation hearing, you committed to working 
with my office and the State of Colorado ahead of the next 
filing season about this. Could you talk about how you are 
thinking about this now, and give some assurance, I hope, to 
people in Colorado about how this is going to be treated?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes. I appreciate the question. I have 
had some time to start to roll up my sleeves and look at the 
issue, and obviously there are multiple States that are 
impacted here. There are questions about the transition out of 
the pandemic, where there are different treatments for COVID 
payments versus not, and I agree. There is confusion, and we 
need to remediate that confusion.
    The one thing I will tell you is that we will not allow 
there to be confusion next filing season, and I want to make 
sure that you and the State of Colorado and other States 
impacted have a heads-up in terms of how we are sorting through 
this issue, so that there is great clarity going into the next 
filing season next year.
    I also need to sort through, Senator Bennet, whose decision 
it is. This is a question that came up earlier. Who gets to 
decide? Is it you, Commissioner? Is it the Secretary of the 
Treasury? Is it Congress? On this one, I am working with my 
colleagues at Treasury to make sure that I understand, is this 
a tax policy call or an IRS administrative call.
    Bottom line, as we head deeper into spring but before the 
summer, I will come meet with you in your office and let you 
know where this is headed in terms of what the process is, and 
make sure that you and the State have a heads-up in terms of 
what the moving pieces are.
    Senator Bennet. I appreciate that, Commissioner. I hate to 
say this, but I think, probably, I do not get to make the call, 
and I hope though that the people who are looking at this 
understand, come to understand, that the IRS has made this call 
the same way for 30 years.
    I mean, it is really aggravating and irritating that this 
happened during the middle of tax filing season. I appreciate 
your saying that that will not be repeated, but that is only 
part of it. Part of it is upsetting an expectation that really 
has existed for decades. I know there are other States involved 
in this. There is no other State that has TABOR. And so I hope 
you will consider that.
    I have another question for you, but I do not have time, so 
I am going to submit it for the record, about the importance of 
staffing at the IRS, and the importance, for example, of having 
a tax counsel there to be able to help do the work that you are 
going to be required to do.
    Because, honestly, I think part of the problem we ran into 
the last time we were going through this was the Department was 
not staffed up in the way that it needed to be, and people were 
making decisions maybe without being in a position to feel like 
they had the latitude.
    I do not know. I cannot explain it. But can you say a word 
about the importance of having a tax counsel at IRS----
    Commissioner Werfel. It's actually critical. Look, there 
are only two Senate-confirmed positions in the IRS, my position 
and the Chief Counsel's position. It is really important that 
we have a chief lawyer at the IRS because, as we have been 
discussing, so many of these issues--and every one of these 
issues actually--has complicated legal elements.
    So you know, we have to recruit lawyers in. We have to work 
with other Senate-confirmed General Counsels across government. 
And not having a Senate-confirmed General Counsel is an 
impediment. I am hoping that we can--and that the 
administration can--put a name before this committee soon.
    The Chairman. That is the point. Senator Bennet is 
absolutely right. We need a nomination.
    The time of my colleague has expired.
    Senator Daines is next.
    Senator Daines. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
    Commissioner Werfel, I would like to begin by addressing my 
Putting First Responders First Act, which was signed into law 
as part of the retirement legislation that we considered in 
this committee last Congress.
    This law will make compensation received by disabled first 
responders tax-exempt even after retirement and, importantly, 
will end the improper audits of disabled first responders that 
stem from ambiguity around the retirement age.
    However, the version that was signed into law moved the 
effective date of the bill to 2026, which was different from 
the 
committee-passed version that had this provision taking effect 
immediately. The unfortunate consequence of this is that 
erroneous IRS audits of disabled first responders could 
continue for the next few years.
    I ask for your commitment to immediately end the improper 
audits of disabled first responders. In a question for the 
record following your confirmation hearing--and frankly, I was 
very dissatisfied with the response. Now you have been 
confirmed; congratulations. I am going to give you another 
opportunity to answer this, which I believe is a very 
straightforward question: will you commit to ending the 
improper audits of disabled first responders?
    Commissioner Werfel. Well, first of all Senator, I want to 
thank you for championing this really important issue. I think 
it is absolutely critical, and I am committed to helping you 
with your objective. What I can commit to you is us issuing 
clarifying guidance that will assist disabled first responders 
when they are preparing their tax returns.
    We are going to conduct outreach with them. We are going to 
walk them through the guidance. We are going to try to mitigate 
the risk of there being an issue of follow-up. If there is an 
issue of follow-up, we will work directly with them to address 
it. I cannot commit, kind of, to exclude all audits on any one 
topic. I just cannot go that far.
    But it has my attention. It is a priority for me, and we 
will work with this community to get it right.
    Senator Daines. I tried to make it easy. I said, ``improper 
audits.'' That is why I said it that way. Let me give you a 
chance to answer it again.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes.
    Senator Daines. Will you commit to ending improper audits 
of disabled first responders? I think----
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes, I will.
    Senator Daines. That is a ``yes'' or ``no,'' and I am 
trying to give you the lanes here to make it clear. Look, as 
you know, a lot of folks watch these responses, and our first 
responders, when you hear their stories, who have been disabled 
while on duty, there are a lot of terrible stories about what 
has happened here in terms of the IRS coming after them. And 
they live in fear, not knowing that the most frightening letter 
to get in the mail is a letter from the IRS saying ``audit,'' 
and they are already dealing with so many issues. So I heard 
you say ``yes.''
    Commissioner Werfel. I did.
    Senator Daines. Okay. Thank you for that answer, and you 
have a lot of families of disabled first responders who will be 
relieved to hear that answer. And look, this committee passed 
it. This was our intent, and thank you for taking some anxiety 
and anxiousness away from families that are already dealing 
with a lot of pain.
    Commissioner Werfel. Absolutely.
    Senator Daines. I appreciate it.
    Commissioner Werfel, you have been quick to tout the 
success of the IRS in the taxpayer experience. However, I think 
it depends a bit on what metric you are looking at. Prior to 
getting into public service, I was working for companies, 
Procter & Gamble being one of them; another was a cloud 
computing company.
    We focused on a CRM suite for large, both public entities 
and private entities that had a B2C kind of model here in 
taking care of customers. You are touting an 84-percent 
customer satisfaction rate for toll-free assistance, but 
simultaneously the IRS is seemingly deprioritizing suspended 
tax returns, amended tax returns, and correspondence.
    There are literally tens of millions of items languishing. 
I know all of us here, when we are working with constituent 
services, deal with our constituents who are saying--we feel 
like we are tow trucks, to go in and get some return that is in 
a ditch somewhere and pull it out, to help the people that we 
serve.
    Should Treasury and the IRS really be taking a victory lap 
at this point based on cherry-picked metrics like the highly 
misleading and often criticized level of service for some of 
its toll-free assistance?
    Commissioner Werfel. So let me--I have several thoughts in 
response. First of all, I think the issue with the backlog of 
paper returns is, we actually are making dramatic progress. I 
mean, we were at a 20 million backlog, and that was caused by 
COVID.
    We never had a backlog like this before, but we had to shut 
down our operations right in the spring of 2020 as the world 
was shutting down. So, days and days of paper piling up, and we 
are still catching up, and we are making progress--like, we cut 
it in half last year to this year. Now we have to--during 
filing season, we have to redirect resources to the phones. We 
do not have as much staff so that we can manage the paper 
backlog.
    With the end of filing season, we anticipate making more 
progress. But I also want to address your question about the 
victory lap. I think it is absolutely critical for the American 
people to understand that when we are funded at the right level 
and we can be there to answer the call, that they do not have 
to wait for 25-30 minutes on the phone wondering if they are 
ever going to get through.
    If we do not have that funding, then we cannot staff the 
customer service centers with the right amount of people. It is 
just--it is math. It is a question of volume, and can we meet 
the demand, and I think that is why we want to celebrate this.
    Senator Daines. So, I am out of time, but my just one 
thought on that is, as you look at your metrics, perhaps in 
some instances it is not as much enjoyment in looking at 
metrics that still are very discouraging.
    But you can talk about the improvements. So, if 20 million 
was the number and you are down to 10 million, let us track 
that number and report on that, and just keep it public as you 
are chipping away on that and the score-boarding idea here to 
get that down to----
    The Chairman. The time of the gentleman has expired.
    Senator Warren?
    Senator Daines. Okay; all right. Thank you.
    Commissioner Werfel. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Warren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    So for years, lobbyists and antitax extremists have worked 
to gut the IRS, to prevent it from chasing down wealthy tax 
cheats, and to keep it from being able to help Americans who 
are honestly trying to file their taxes.
    But thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRS now has 
the resources it needs to make tax filing free and easy. This 
has been on the IRS agenda, their ``to do'' list, for decades. 
Back in 2003, the IRS set up the Free File program, which was a 
partnership with companies like Intuit and H&R Block, that was 
supposed to make filing free for 70 percent of taxpayers.
    But today, that Free File program serves just 2 percent of 
Americans, and that is because the tax prep companies sabotaged 
the program so they could keep raking in money, deliberately 
hiding Free File web pages from Google searches and confusing 
eligible taxpayers by marketing other fake free programs to 
them, only to scam them by collecting a fee later on.
    So let me start here, Commissioner Werfel. Do you agree 
that the current Free File program is a failure?
    Commissioner Werfel. I agree. It is not reaching as many 
people as it should.
    Senator Warren. Yes, the difference between 2 percent and 
70 percent.
    Commissioner Werfel. It is massive.
    Senator Warren. I think that's a failure. Tax prep 
companies have sabotaged the Free File program. They have 
tricked and trapped American taxpayers into paying for 
alternative services that should be free, that are marketed as 
free, but in fact they do not make free.
    And the result is that today, the IRS reports that 
Americans waste an average of 13 hours and $250 each year 
filing their taxes. The Treasury Department analysts estimate 
that about 12 million low-income Americans miss out on 
thousands of dollars in refunds, likely because it is too 
expensive and too difficult to file through these supposedly 
free options.
    So, Commissioner Werfel, do you agree that the private tax 
filing option that companies are pushing instead of Free File 
is also failing American taxpayers?
    Commissioner Werfel. The whole process needs to be 
improved; I agree. We need better clarity. When I hear the 
premise of your question, I think about the Taxpayer Bill of 
Rights, and just ticking off, three of them were violated just 
in your question, in terms of the implication. So we have an 
obligation to make the tax system easier for taxpayers to 
navigate, and you know, Congress hands us a very complicated 
tax code.
    Senator Warren. I understand that.
    Commissioner Werfel. We have to make it simpler. And so, 
yes, I want to work with you and with this committee and with 
taxpayers to make that process easier. If they are eligible for 
Free File and they are not taking advantage of that or are 
getting tripped up along the way, what can we do to help?
    Senator Warren. Okay. So look, the Government 
Accountability Office, the National Taxpayer Advocate, Treasury 
Secretary Yellen, many of our colleagues on this committee all 
agree, that it is high time for the IRS to develop its own 
truly free and easy way for hardworking Americans to file their 
taxes and to claim their refunds.
    Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRS now has the 
resources to do so, including dedicated funding to develop a 
roadmap for direct e-filing options with a report to Congress 
due next month. Now, I am looking forward to the report. You do 
not have to say here what it is going to do. I know we will 
have an opportunity then to talk more about the specifics of 
what the IRS can do to help tax filers. But broadly speaking, 
Commissioner Werfel, can you explain why offering a free and 
easy way to file directly with the IRS would help American 
taxpayers, particularly low-
income and middle-income families?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes. Again, as you said, we are 
issuing a report by congressional mandate in mid-May, and that 
will walk through a lot of the issues. I think one of the goals 
that we have at the IRS is to increase the options that 
taxpayers have to engage with us. If they want it fully 
digital, they should have it fully digital. If they want to do 
it in paper, we are not thrilled with that, but we have to meet 
taxpayers where they are.
    And if they want to come directly to the IRS versus working 
through a third party, we now have the opportunity to study 
that and tell Congress what the implication of that is. As a 
guiding principle, the more workable options, the better.
    But because Congress asked and has legitimate questions 
about the issues associated with the direct-file program, we 
are going to answer them, and then I will come back in mid- or 
late May, and we can talk through what the report said.
    Senator Warren. Good. Well, I look forward to that, and I 
think it is clear though. Americans deserve an IRS that ensures 
that folks at the top pay what they owe, and that honest 
hardworking Americans can file their taxes without spending an 
excessive amount of time or a lot of money to get that done. I 
think that is where we are aiming.
    Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Commissioner, and thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    The Chairman. I am just thinking as I listen to this, we 
have been working for more workable options for decades now, so 
it is time to figure it out.
    Okay. Next is--let us see--Senator Cortez Masto.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Hit the lottery here. How are you? 
Good to see you.
    Commissioner Werfel. I am good.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you for joining us, 
Commissioner. I always appreciate your attentiveness in 
response to questions and calls as well.
    Let me talk to you about something that has not been 
discussed here, but it is important for many of us who are 
dealing with, unfortunately, disasters in our community and 
Governor-declared disasters.
    This winter, Nevada has dealt with a series of severe 
storms, which have resulted in major damage causing widespread 
flooding, rockslides, landslides. They have threatened 
communities and contributed to more than $10 million in damages 
to our public infrastructure. The Governor and our Federal 
delegation have asked President Biden to issue a major disaster 
declaration.
    But I wanted to discuss how issues like this can impact tax 
filing. I have a bipartisan bill that would allow the IRS to 
delay the tax filing deadlines upon the written request of a 
Governor, when a disaster has been declared. It is very 
critical that we have this. What we are seeing--wildfires, 
disasters happening--it has an impact, and I am hearing from my 
constituents, unfortunately, who are dealing with these 
disasters, on their ability to try to file these taxes.
    So my question, I guess, Commissioner, to you, is, do you 
agree with the need to provide taxpayers flexibility in meeting 
that filing deadline when something like a natural disaster 
occurs?
    Commissioner Werfel. I do. I mean, we have a long history 
of extending deadlines and creating flexibilities for 
individuals impacted by natural disasters. I think it is an 
important function for the IRS to not have a one-size-fits-all 
approach and assume every taxpayer is in the same situation.
    We appreciate having those tools. The final position the 
administration can offer on any bill rests with the Treasury 
Department. But as a guiding principle, tools to help taxpayers 
in need are something that we are very interested in at IRS.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. That is what I am hearing 
from you today in your answers to my colleagues' questions.
    Let me jump to a separate subject. Immigrants face unique 
barriers to filing taxes. As a result, we have seen lower 
immigrant uptake rates of tax credits, such as the Child Tax 
Credit, especially in Latino families.
    The two questions I have for you are what steps the IRS is 
taking to remove barriers to filing taxes and receiving tax 
credits, and currently it is my understanding that the IRS does 
not allow ITIN applications to be processed electronically, and 
requires that ITIN applicants file a tax return along with 
their application.
    I guess my question to you is, would you consider 
eliminating these barriers for ITIN applicants? So two 
questions, if you would, regarding the ITIN applications, and 
how do we deal with these barriers to filing taxes and 
receiving tax credits for some members of our immigrant 
community who want to file taxes?
    Commissioner Werfel. I think it has been a theme of this 
hearing in terms of taxpayers who are eligible for benefits, 
refunds, credits, you know. We have recently announced it 
publicly, and we tried to make a lot of press about it, to 
file, because the statute of limitations on your refunds is 
expiring. We have a lot of unclaimed refunds. People who can 
file, who can claim their refunds, are not doing so, and we 
want to make sure that we are paying people what they are owed.
    Senator Cortez Masto. So how do you reach out to those 
immigrant communities, the Latino communities, who are paying 
taxes or want to pay their taxes but there are barriers?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. There may be a language barrier.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes. We have to do more with our 
stakeholders, the intermediaries. We have to work more in 
communities. I mean, Senator, earlier I was talking about--one 
of the reasons why I am excited about the Inflation Reduction 
Act plan that we issued is that it really does allow us to 
establish three very clear priorities.
    The first priority I listed was customer service, and that 
is not just about answering the phones, and it is not just 
about improving the call center, both of which are important. 
It is also about outreach. It is about better understanding 
taxpayers.
    They are a diverse group. They are not all in the same 
situation. Some are struggling because of a disaster. Some are 
struggling because they are acclimating to the United States in 
some way. And some are struggling because they financially 
cannot afford to pay what they owe, and we want to get them on 
installment agreements and help them that way.
    We can do better in all of those outreach efforts, and I am 
looking forward to working with the team at the IRS to do that.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, and I know my time is up.
    Finally, in response to your conversation earlier with 
Senator Johnson, as you provide that feedback, that information 
that he requested from the chair, can you distinguish between 
the two?
    You have auditors and you have investigators. You have 
criminal investigators that investigate fraud, criminal fraud, 
and then you have auditors who are looking at the tax returns 
of individuals and corporations. Can you, when you provide that 
information, distinguish between the two?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. And would an individual receive 
outreach from an auditor if there is a technical question that 
auditor has about their tax return?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Okay. So that could be separate from 
a criminal investigator who may be responding to an 
investigation they are doing for criminal fraud; correct?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes. Yes; and we try to be clear, and 
we can ramp up our communication efforts on this, when you can 
expect to be contacted by the IRS. It can happen, and it 
typically happens because there are questions that we have 
about what you filed. It might be a criminal question, it might 
just be an audit question, but it does happen.
    One of the things that I am worried about is that we need 
to make clear that more often than not, if someone is telling 
you they are from the IRS, they are not, and it is a scam. It 
is not easy to navigate, but we do need at times--and we are 
going to try to be as transparent as possible--to reach out to 
taxpayers.
    I am really committed to creating a culture in the IRS 
where, when we are doing outreach, it is to help. This is this 
customer service point.
    The Chairman. The time of my colleague has expired.
    Senator Brown?
    Senator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Commissioner, as I 
have said to you privately, thank you for returning to public 
service. IRS Commissioner, not the easiest job on the planet, 
especially when you are subject to political attacks pretty 
much all the time, but I'm glad you are up to the task.
    Earlier, you told Senator Wyden how much the IRS's service 
has improved since last filing season. Things are getting 
better. My constituents are still frustrated with the IRS--no 
surprise--particularly small businesses waiting to receive the 
Employee Retention Tax credit, to which they are entitled. I 
know your staff is working on resolving these cases. I 
appreciate your attention to it.
    I know you touched on outreach with Senator Warner earlier. 
Last fall, IRS sent letters to 9 million households that 
appeared to be eligible for the EITC or CTC--something that 
Senator Wyden has made such a priority in this committee--but 
have not claimed them.
    We know that roughly one in five EITC-eligible households 
do not claim it. What are some of your findings from last 
fall's outreach? How will you build off it to improve outreach 
to these households?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes. I think the reality is that we 
have work to do, in particular, Senator, because what we are 
seeing happen too often is that individuals are seeking to 
encourage people to apply for the credit that are not actually 
eligible. So we are seeing some challenges--improper payments 
or fraud in the system--that we have to weed through.
    That does not mean we do not want to make sure that people 
again understand what they are eligible for. So I think there 
is more take-up rate that can happen, and we are seeing 
employee credits come in; retention credits and other types of 
credits still come in the door. But every time we do an 
outreach effort, we learn something, and we are on a continuous 
improvement journey.
    So the challenge is, how do we hit the right people with 
the right set of guidance, make sure they understand, help them 
navigate the complexity? They may be disincentivized because 
they think it is going to be too hard. How do we answer those 
questions effectively, and how do we also create an important 
firewall, to make sure that people are not duped by nefarious 
players that are trying to take advantage of that?
    Senator Brown. Speaking of that, could you reduce improper 
payments if Congress let you regulate paid tax preparers?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes.
    Senator Brown. Okay; important to know.
    When you were here last, I asked you about the 1099-K 
reporting threshold.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes.
    Senator Brown. My concern is, this was a burden on Ohioans, 
a burden on third-party platforms, and a burden on the IRS. 
Would a higher threshold make this simpler for you to 
administer, so that IRS could focus its resources more 
efficiently, and therefore would you support congressional 
efforts to increase the threshold?
    Commissioner Werfel. So, I will answer the first question: 
absolutely, yes. The higher the threshold--it would reduce 
volume, it would reduce complexity. It would make the IRS's job 
a lot easier. In terms of whether we could support it, that is 
an issue that I always have to defer to Treasury on.
    Senator Brown. Okay.
    Commissioner Werfel. On any piece of legislation, I do not 
have the authority to give the administration's position. It is 
the Treasury that does that.
    Senator Brown. Okay. And I know Senator Hassan--you know, 
we have talked about this. Senator Hassan and I are working on 
this, to increase the threshold to $10,000, cutting down red 
tape for taxpayers and providing the advantages to IRS that you 
mentioned.
    Last question. I would like to see the new energy credits 
from the IRA work in support of American manufacturing, 
spurring genuine domestic supply chains, particularly in the 
solar industry where so much capacity needs to be built 
quickly. My State, in northwestern Ohio, has the largest solar 
manufacturer in the country. Tell us about IRS plans to 
administer these manufacturing credits to minimize the 
administrative burdens and delays to issuing the credits, so 
that the critical IRA funding will truly benefit these 
reshoring efforts.
    Commissioner Werfel. And we have a lot of work to do, 
Senator. We have issued a variety of different notices. We have 
requested information. We are taking in a ton of input from a 
variety of different stakeholders about how they want to see 
IRS regulation and IRS guidance issued. I expect that we will 
issue, in the coming months, additional notices of proposed 
rulemaking, and we are going to get a lot of comments.
    I was answering a question earlier, I think, from Senator 
Cornyn about--you know, there are a lot of moving pieces to 
track in terms of different input and different stakeholders. 
And the right way to do it is to go out with an advance or a 
notice, lay out the issues, collect the feedback, and then 
publicly discuss, as much as possible, the various tradeoffs we 
need to make in making these work.
    I look forward to talking to you once we have a fuller set 
of feedback from the various stakeholders as part of our notice 
and comment rulemaking, to see where things are landing and 
getting your feedback.
    Senator Brown. Thank you, Commissioner.
    The Chairman. Senator Brown, good points. And I 
particularly appreciate your hammering away on solar 
manufacturing. We are going to regret it deeply in this country 
if we look back at this period and we gave short shrift to 
solar manufacturing.
    A lot of panels are coming from overseas. I get all that. 
We've got to manufacture more at home. Thank you for making the 
point.
    Our next questioner will be Senator Young.
    Senator Young. Good to see you, Commissioner. Thanks for 
being here today. I know you have only been on the job for a 
short period of time, and there are, no doubt, a whole number 
of improvements that you would like to see made that have not 
yet been fully carried out.
    So, with that in mind, I want to first focus on some trends 
that we have seen in this 2023 tax filing season. In your 
remarks today, you stated that the tax filing season has gone 
well. Among other things, you point to the IRS's phone 
performance, claiming to have answered more calls from 
taxpayers seeking your help than in 2022.
    On this particular point, I would have to refer you back to 
our own reported numbers: 3.9 million is the number of lower 
calls as of April 8th that the IRS has answered in 2023, as 
compared to that same time last year. So there were 3.9 million 
fewer calls. Beyond this, I would like to reflect on a few 
additional IRS-provided numbers given to us by TIGTA, that are 
not routinely reported to the public, all as of April 1st of 
this year.
    Ten-point-five million is the number of Calendar Year 2022 
and 2023 original tax returns that have not been fully 
processed because they have been suspended. Three million is 
the number of these returns that the IRS considers to be 
``overaged,'' which works out to nearly 30 percent.
    Six-point-seven million is the number of Calendar Year 2022 
and 2023 amended tax returns that have not been processed, and 
4.7 million is the number of fees returns that the IRS 
considers to be overaged, which works out to be more than 70 
percent. I am almost done painting the picture here.
    Ten and a quarter million is the number of Calendar Year 
2022 and 2023 items of taxpayer correspondence that have not 
been worked, and 5.9 million--the last number here--is the 
number of these items that the IRS considers to be overaged, 
which works to be almost 60 percent.
    So you know, it is nice to hear that the average call wait 
times have decreased for those who call and are actually able 
to connect to the IRS. Call volume to the IRS is down 
significantly year to year. Despite this decrease, the backlog 
of taxpayer inventory continues.
    So, just to clarify, Commissioner Werfel, after getting all 
these numbers on the record and trying to bring some clarity to 
the picture, do you believe that the tax filing season has gone 
well for the tens of millions of Americans whose original 
returns remain suspended, amended returns remain unprocessed, 
or correspondence languishes in a bin somewhere, none of whom 
are receiving their refunds or having their questions or issues 
addressed in the meantime?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes. I would say compared to last 
year, the tax filing season has been a dramatic improvement. I 
think it is important to amplify that, Senator, because it was 
only possible with additional resources and our ability to add 
more staff.
    We did make progress on the backlog, but not enough 
progress. This started during COVID. We never had a backlog 
like this before, but when we had to shut down our operations, 
we had trucks full of returns sitting in the parking lots that 
we could not process until we could get back to operations.
    I will say this: IRS employees came back earlier than any 
other Federal employees, had to work, social distance. It was 
really heroic what the IRS was able to do in the spring of 2020 
as COVID was unfolding. But this raises the key point, which 
is, how do we build an infrastructure in the IRS so that we can 
do both, so that we can manage the call volume and reduce the 
call volume?
    I do not know if my number is right, or your number is 
right. We will get to the bottom of that.
    Senator Young. These numbers are right; these numbers are 
right.
    Commissioner Werfel. But if you say that the call volume 
went down, that is actually a good thing. That means that our 
website is working effectively. That means that our apps are 
working on our smartphones more effectively. If we can build 
that infrastructure and modernize it--it is an example----
    If we just operate at the same budget or less, then maybe 
we can answer the calls. If we have investments, then maybe we 
can build, and build the callback option so that people do not 
have to wait.
    Senator Young. Right. What the committee wants, what I 
want, what I think you and certainly my constituents want, 
Commissioner, is to make sure that we are getting and giving 
the whole picture here, in terms of what the taxpayer is 
experiencing and what the IRS's performance is. So, you want to 
be transparent. I voted to confirm you in this position because 
I still believe that, and I did at the time.
    Yet it is not transparent when the bad news of filing 
season--there is a mix of good and bad. It is provided by 
Inspectors General, while the IRS solely highlights what it 
believes to be, you know, their most positive facts. So going 
forward, just in short, will you do everything you can to 
increase full transparency with respect to the IRS's 
performance, good and bad, Commissioner?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes. I love the idea of a balanced 
scorecard, Senator, absolutely.
    Senator Young. Yes.
    Commissioner Werfel. I think the reason why I want to 
amplify the positives is because I want to make sure that it is 
understood how important fully funding this base operation is.
    Senator Young. Thanks, Commissioner.
    Senator Crapo. Senator Whitehouse?
    Senator Whitehouse. Commissioner----
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes.
    Senator Whitehouse. I want to talk to you about the use and 
abuse of 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) entities in the political 
space.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes.
    Senator Whitehouse. That is an area that the IRS has 
responsibility for overseeing; is that correct?
    Commissioner Werfel. That is correct.
    Senator Whitehouse. So, the Citizens United decision of the 
Supreme Court posited something that I have no disagreement 
with, which is, that if big political spending is not 
transparent, it is corrupting. That is why transparency was so 
important to that decision. Political spending that is not 
transparent is corrupting. That is the law of the land, and we 
have massive non-transparent political spending taking place, 
corrupting political spending.
    It is over $2 billion, and it could be a lot more, 
depending on reporting glitches. So here are some of the 
problems that we see emerging. First of all, to play in the 
political space with 501(c)(3)s and 501(c)(4)s, the current 
State of the art is to have a twinned 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4).
    The 501(c)(3) is not supposed to do any politics at all. 
The 501(c)(4) is only supposed to do half. The 501(c)(3)s and 
the 501(c)(4)s tend to have the same locations, the same staff, 
the same boards, the same funders, and yet nobody's looking at 
piercing the corporate veil and seeing whether the 501(c)(3)s 
are being used to improperly support 501(c)(4) political 
effort. So, I would like to have you take a look at that 
question.
    Second, 501(c)(4)s are only supposed to do less than half 
on politics. But what we see is associated 501(c)(4)s that are 
providing an orchestrated cascade where the donor gives, let us 
say a million dollars, to 501(c)(4) front group number one, 
which spends half of that on politics, and gives the other half 
to front group number two, which spends half of that on 
politics.
    Now we are up to $750,000, which gives that other $250,000 
to another related fund group, another $125,000. Now you are up 
to $875,000. One more, and you are over $900,000 out of the 
million being spent on politics in a coordinated way, 
conceivably around a single table in a single meeting room.
    Finally, we have instances of what seems to be massive 
self-
enrichment in this environment, as people seem to be paying 
each other off, again using these 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) 
mechanisms. My challenge to you is that I have seen big 
blowback from big special interests when the IRS has tried to 
do its job in this space.
    I think you saw some of that pretty close to hand, and I 
think that the IRS has chickened out and refused to do its job 
in this space because they fear that political blowback, and 
they have created basically a lawless arena here in which the 
ref has chickened out and left the field.
    I ask you to pull up your socks, do your job, look at these 
501(c)(3)s and 501(c)(4)s, and in particular, look at these new 
behaviors with the numbers being so massive, with the 
coordination between 501(c)(3)s and 501(c)(4)s being so 
suspect, and with the 50-percent rule being flouted--to the 
extent it made any sense in the beginning--being flouted by 
coordinated groups of 501(c)(4)s operating in conjunction. Will 
you do that?
    Commissioner Werfel. Well, Senator, it is interesting that 
you used the referee analogy. I shared with the team when I 
arrived at the IRS that it does feel like the IRS is the 
referee, in that we get booed whether we get the call right or 
we get the call wrong. There is nothing wrong with that; that 
is our role.
    But we cannot leave the field, you know. We can take the 
boos, but we have to be on the field. So my answer to you is, 
if we are falling short of our responsibilities, then we have 
to take a close look at that and figure out what we are doing--
--
    Senator Whitehouse. It looks to me like you are completely 
falling short, that you have vacated the field, that there is 
no effort being put into any of this because of the harassment 
that the IRS received when it last took a look in these areas.
    Commissioner Werfel. I think I would ask----
    Senator Whitehouse. If I am wrong, please correct me with a 
response for the record.
    Commissioner Werfel. Well, I think there is--you are not 
wrong in that it is an extremely complicated space. We learned 
10 years ago how complicated a space it is. It asks the IRS to 
answer questions that are extremely, extremely sensitive, and 
places that onus on the IRS in an environment where we are 
trying to build trust with taxpayers and improve the overall 
dynamic that we have with taxpayers. So I think----
    Senator Whitehouse. My time is up, so let me--we will 
follow up as needed on that.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes, we are going to have to follow up 
on that.
    Senator Whitehouse. Let me also just quickly thank you for 
your work on our reciprocal FATCA bill, and I think that is 
important to both stemming offshore tax evasion and dealing 
with kleptocrat assets, and I yield back.
    Commissioner Werfel. Thank you.
    Senator Crapo. Thank you.
    Senator Carper?
    Senator Carper. Thanks. Thanks, Senator Crapo. Welcome 
back. It seems like a month ago we were sitting here, and we 
were having your confirmation hearing, your appearance, and 
your spouse and your children were all sitting behind you full 
of joy and pride, and I hope they still feel that way. Again, 
we are so grateful to all of them for sharing you with our 
country.
    Commissioner Werfel. Somehow, I am 2 inches shorter now, 
Senator.
    Senator Carper. Well, you do not look it; you do not look 
it.
    Commissioner Werfel. I have a great team holding me up 
here.
    Senator Carper. That is good.
    Today, there are no minimum standards, as you know, for our 
professional requirements for paid tax preparers. It is not a 
new issue. This is one we have talked about, and frankly not 
done enough about, for years. But the problem too often results 
in error-filled tax filings, sometimes outright fraud, as you 
know.
    While most preparers provide excellent service to their 
clients, the IRS receives tens of thousands of complaints, tens 
of thousands of complaints each year, about bad actors, and for 
these reasons the Government Accountability Office has 
recommended again and again and again that the Congress give 
the IRS the authority to establish standards to properly 
regulate paid preparers, especially those who may be acting in 
bad faith or preparing inaccurate tax returns.
    Again, this is not a new issue. It is one that we have 
actually, I think, discussed before. How is the IRS managing 
the risk associated with paid preparers who knowingly or 
unknowingly prepare inaccurate returns, and what more should 
the Congress do to further protect taxpayers?
    Commissioner Werfel. Senator, it is such an important 
issue. As I move up my learning curve every day on tax 
administration, I start to see that there are moments where 
problems occur and there is not a victim. It is just--it is a 
mistake. The wrong amount might be paid. The victim might be 
the government's finances, but there is not an individual 
person who is a victim.
    But in the cases that you raise, there are victims. There 
are people who are being taken advantage of, often vulnerable 
populations, unsuspecting, and it can be heartbreaking, and it 
is angering. I want the IRS to be doing its part to really kind 
of close this type of stuff down and to be as aggressive as we 
can be in dealing with these nefarious individuals who are 
creating victims in order to financially benefit themselves 
through the tax system.
    More tools would be helpful. As I said earlier, I cannot 
comment formally on legislation. That is the domain of the 
Treasury Department. But you know, we always welcome tools that 
can help us do more outreach or crack down on fraud and on the 
type of behavior where the result is a victim.
    And so, I know that we have teams of people at the IRS that 
are looking at these nefarious preparers, trying to determine 
how we can get to them earlier. There is a lot of education. 
During filing season, Senator, we do something we call ``The 
Dirty Dozen,'' which is where we outline the tax scams that are 
out there.
    We try to promote it, get as much publicity as we can out 
to Americans, that these are the types of things to be on the 
lookout for. And scamming preparers is one of the things that 
is always front and center in our Dirty Dozen.
    Senator Carper. Okay; thank you.
    Commissioner Werfel. So helping get the message out is 
critical.
    Senator Carper. Good. Thanks for that.
    I think Senator Warren may have raised, before I arrived at 
the hearing today, the issue of no-cost filing services and 
expanding those.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes.
    Senator Carper. But with the 2023 tax filing season coming 
to a close, many of my constituents recently went through the 
complex and often costly process of filing their tax returns. 
My wife and I did too. A lot of the Free File program was 
created to simplify this process at no cost for low-income 
taxpayers. The program is not working as intended.
    And a review of the program that I requested from GAO, from 
the Government Accountability Office not long ago, found that 
the program's utilization rate is drastically low, 
disappointingly low. I think some 4 percent of eligible 
taxpayers used the program in 2020--4 percent.
    In response, the GAO recommended that the IRS offer 
additional options for a free online filing service. 
Fortunately, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, as you 
know, the IRS now has the resources to expand access to free, 
simplified filing options, which would improve tax compliance 
and strengthen the fairness of the tax system.
    Here is my question. What are the benefits of expanding no-
cost filing options for low- and middle-income taxpayers, and 
what action is the IRS taking to make it easier and more 
accessible now for taxpayers to file their tax returns in 
future years?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes. So the main benefit is options, 
you know. Different taxpayers have different preferences, based 
on their preference, based on their position, in terms of how 
they are going to engage with the IRS. We would love all 
taxpayers to engage with us in a more digital way, but not all 
taxpayers can.
    Some of them want to walk into our walk-in centers, and we 
have been able to open more walk-in centers with the Inflation 
Reduction Act. The benefit, Senator, is options. Taxpayers need 
options. And the other benefit is, if we can implement these 
options in a way that simplifies a very complicated journey 
that can often be very intimidating, then we have created a 
true benefit to America and to citizens, that they have 
optionality, and we have made their job easier of complying 
with the code.
    Senator Crapo. Thank you.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes, and the Inflation Reduction Act 
does provide us needed resources to be able to build those 
channels. Now, I know there is this one question that is out 
there on direct file, and as I mentioned earlier, we are 
mandated by the Inflation Reduction Act to study it. I think 
when we produce that study, we will be able to discuss 
potential issues, strategies, and what to do from here.
    Senator Carper. All right. Thanks so much.
    Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Crapo. Senator Cassidy?
    Senator Cassidy. Thank you. Commissioner, thank you for 
being here.
    During your confirmation hearings, I asked if the IRS would 
consider having a third-party vendor to do your IT management. 
And at the time, I submitted for the record news reports going 
back to the 1980s, where IRS has requested lots more money, and 
then a lot of news reports that said they have not accomplished 
what they attempted to do.
    It is like, you know, Christmas. Every year, IRS wants more 
money for IT, and every year there are reports that it is 
delayed. So you suggested an openness to the concept then. Has 
that been acted upon, analyzed, and in any way encouraged?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes, absolutely. Looking at our IT 
strategy, you know, I am moving up my learning curve on where 
we are with our technology. What I have learned is, look, there 
have been successes, and I am very interested in those 
successes, and I can talk to you about them. Why am I so 
interested in these successes? Because what were the 
preconditions for those successes? Why were we able to build 
and deploy a successful, modernized e-file program? How did 
that happen?
    And then there are non-successes, as you know. There are 
areas where we set out to accomplish something--for example, to 
fully modernize the Individual Master File--and we have only 
made progress, but we have not fully modernized it.
    Senator Cassidy. But that is how many years overdue?
    Commissioner Werfel. You could look at different time 
frames, but it is years overdue in terms of being fully 
modernized. But there are elements of it that are modern.
    Senator Cassidy. So let me ask, just because I have other 
questions----
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes, please.
    Senator Cassidy [continuing]. Has contracting with a third 
party, such as the Department of Defense does for some of these 
services, been part of the considerations?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes, and you know, one of the things 
that I have also learned is that two-thirds of our IT spend is 
on contractors, one-third on IRS employees. That does not mean 
that that is the right level.
    Senator Cassidy. Now of course, contractors are separate 
from going to the cloud with----
    Commissioner Werfel. I think--you raised that during the 
confirmation hearing, and I am absolutely pushing the team to 
look at cloud service-oriented architectures like cloud as an 
alternative.
    Senator Cassidy. So great.
    Commissioner Werfel. Absolutely.
    Senator Cassidy. I do not mean to cut you off; I just have 
limited time.
    Commissioner Werfel. No, I get you.
    Senator Cassidy. Okay, next. In 2020, the IRS proposed, 
made final regulations regarding guidance on the definition of 
medical care under section 213(d) of the IRS code--essentially, 
what primary services are and are not qualified medical 
expenses for the purposes of HSAs.
    And the final rule said that direct primary care is 
``expenses for medical care under section 213 of the code. 
Because these payments are for medical care, a health 
reimbursement arrangement provided by an employer generally may 
reimburse an employee for DPC arrangement payments.''
    That is great. It works for businesses. But it stops short 
of saying the same things for individuals, and IRS still takes 
the position that DPC arrangements are insurance or some sort 
of health plan. So we have two separate treatments for a piece 
of--you see where I am going with that.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes, I totally see where you are going 
with it, and I think it is a really good question. It was not 
on my radar screen. It is now, and I want to get to the bottom 
of whether these things are insurance or not. I have started to 
have conversations. I understand there is a complication. I 
understand there are benefits to an interpretation that would 
not have it treated as insurance, and I want to get back to you 
on it.
    Senator Cassidy. I appreciate that.
    Secondly, we have had, my office has pushed--you know, part 
of the reason for the backlog is that they have these services 
that kind of fill up your phone calls with automated services, 
so that you have to go to them to get through.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes.
    Senator Cassidy. And you had a pilot program as to how to 
address that. How is the pilot program going, may I ask?
    Commissioner Werfel. It worked, you know. And part of it is 
that we were able to get the reporting time down to 4 minutes--
or the waiting time down to 4 minutes.
    Senator Cassidy. Is that by taking out the automated calls?
    Commissioner Werfel. It was partly that. The reason is, we 
were----
    Senator Cassidy. So is that pilot going to be expanded to 
the entirety of this, because I was told it was a pilot. Has it 
now become----
    Commissioner Werfel. I do not know that I can say--we are 
going to continue to leverage that type of solution, to make 
sure that we are preventing that practice, because that is not 
a fair practice.
    Senator Cassidy. Yes, it seemed like----
    Commissioner Werfel. We had success, which is the bottom 
line, and you always want to replicate that success. So we are 
very interested in figuring out why it went right and how to 
scale it.
    Senator Cassidy. Sounds great.
    Then if you are filing--someone in the private sector is 
obviously filing returns for people, but do you perceive a 
conflict of interest where the IRS, which is going to tax 
people, is also helping them to fill out their forms? The 
interpretation, which an independent filer may take on their 
behalf, might then be taken in a different way.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes, it is an important question. I 
think it is a policy question, actually. What I want to do is 
answer the question, what are the operational implications of a 
direct file program? The idea that the IRS would be more 
involved in tax preparation through a direct file--I mean, I 
think other countries do it.
    It is a debate. I don't want to weigh in on the debate. I 
want you and the Treasury Department and the President to 
decide, and then we will figure out how to administer it.
    Senator Cassidy. Thank you for your great answers.
    I yield.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague. I think he missed some 
of the earlier discussion, because I and Senator Crapo, Senator 
Warren, a number of Senators, have asked questions about Free 
File. The history of this is pretty interesting. Down at the 
end of the dais on your side, Dan Coats was with me on a 
bipartisan Free File proposal years ago, and of course, all of 
the powerful interests came out and said western civilization 
was going to end.
    We tried to simply say, it would be voluntary. In other 
words, all parties agree that if we go forward with such a 
thing for the people of Louisiana and Oregon and everywhere 
else, it will be an option. It will not be required in any way, 
shape, or form. So we look forward to having that discussion. I 
thank you.
    Senator Menendez?
    Senator Menendez. Congratulations, Commissioner, on your 
confirmation.
    Over the last year, I led eight letters to the IRS about a 
range of customer service issues impacting taxpayers. Just as 
the IRS expects taxpayers to file on time, taxpayers and tax 
professionals should be able to count on the IRS to answer the 
phone, respond to questions, and process refunds in a timely 
manner.
    Thanks to the resources provided by the Inflation Reduction 
Act, the IRS has hired 5,000 new customer service workers to 
help meet taxpayer needs. It is now consistently answering the 
phones, as I understand it, between 80 and 90 percent of the 
time, at an average speed of 4 minutes compared to last year, 
when the average level of phone service was 17 percent with a 
speed-of-answer rate of 27 minutes.
    So that is good. But there is still more work to be done. 
Currently, it takes approximately 20 weeks to amend paper and 
electronic returns. Commissioner, can we expect a more 
acceptable timeline for the IRS to process amended returns?
    Commissioner Werfel. You should expect it, and we should be 
held accountable for it. I mentioned earlier, we have the 
ability post-filing season to redirect some of our staff to the 
paper backlog versus being on the phones, because the call 
volumes should go down. That will enable us to process more. We 
are scanning more paper forms. The more we scan, the easier it 
is to get them processed. It makes the process more fluid.
    And then there are longer-term solutions, whether it is 
hiring more people to help process these paper and amended 
returns, or building technology solutions to automate it more, 
because right now in most cases, we can't accept an amended 
return electronically. This is why the Inflation Reduction Act 
is not just about managing the day-to-day. It was not supposed 
to be about that. It was supposed to be about modernizing, and 
I am hoping we can preserve those funds in the Inflation 
Reduction Act.
    Senator Menendez. So with all of that, what can we get this 
down to, and in what time frame do you think that can happen?
    Commissioner Werfel. Well, as an example, I mentioned that, 
on the employee retention credit--I mentioned to Senator Warner 
we are resolving about 20,000 a week right now post-filing 
season. I am asking the team to double that output, and to 
focus on the oldest first, obviously, to make first those that 
have been waiting the longest.
    But I appreciate the question. It is part of the challenge 
that we have in terms of this paper backlog, but we are making 
progress.
    Senator Menendez. Okay. Well, correcting a small mistake 
should not lead to a 5-month delay in receiving a refund, and 
so I am proud of the progress you have made, but we need to do 
better.
    Let me ask you, with reference to a joint report from 
Stanford University and the Department of Treasury, it found 
that Black taxpayers are at least three times as likely to be 
audited by the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS does not 
collect data on race or ethnicity, and reports suggest that the 
disparity is attributed to discrimination in the IRS's computer 
algorithms that select returns for audit. The report also found 
that the IRS disproportionately audits people who claim the 
Earned Income Tax Credit.
    So, Commissioner, the last time you were before this 
committee, you committed to providing a report on this issue 
within 60 days of your confirmation. That would be May 9th, so 
we are not there yet; I understand that.
    But with that commitment nearly 3 weeks away, what have you 
learned about the issue, and how is the IRS planning to address 
this inequity?
    Commissioner Werfel. So, I want to start with the important 
premise that it is essential that our tax system is fair. 
Fairness is what anchors our mission statement. And when I got 
the directive from this committee to issue a report in 60 days, 
I engaged with my team on Day 1 to make sure it is a priority 
to fully understand what is going on with this report from 
Stanford, and how do we get to the bottom of it and figure out 
what we need to do going ahead.
    I do not want to get ahead of the final report, because it 
is not done yet. I will share that we are asking, I think, the 
right set of questions. We are asking questions like, what are 
the major tenets of IRS's current corrective plan to address 
improper payments? Do existing EITC case selection processes 
unfairly raise audit rates for Black taxpayers in relation to 
non-Black taxpayers? There are about six or seven key questions 
that we are answering.
    Senator Menendez. Are you still committed to providing a 
written report to the committee by May 9th?
    Commissioner Werfel. Absolutely.
    Senator Menendez. Okay.
    And then finally, while we are on the topic of tax equity 
and tax administration, the IRS contracted with ID.me for 
verification services this tax season, despite a track record 
of inequitable outcomes for minority taxpayers. When can we 
expect the IRS to use login.gov for verification services?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes, and we are very interested in 
adding additional authenticating providers, and login.gov is 
one that we are interested in. It is my understanding that they 
are working through, at GSA, some security issues, and they 
want to make sure that they have wrapped up. Once those 
security issues have wrapped up, we will move forward with 
login.gov as a provider.
    Senator Menendez. Well, I would like you to be able to give 
us a report when you see you are on your way to that.
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes, absolutely.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you.
    Commissioner Werfel. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Menendez, for coming down 
strongly on this matter of racial disparities. It was so 
striking when we heard the original conversation. If they got 
that kind of information when they were not looking for it, it 
just struck us that we had better get on it, because if you are 
going to look for it, it could be significantly more serious. 
So, thank you. I look forward to working with you.
    All right. Senator Tillis?
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Commissioner Werfel, 
I appreciated the time we spent in the office. I was one of the 
four Republican members of this committee who voted for your 
confirmation, along with two others off the committee, because 
I think you bring a private-sector experience and deep 
knowledge of the IRS.
    If I were confronted--if I were back in my job at Price 
Waterhouse consulting with enterprise transformation, and I was 
assigned to a client that was struggling to meet current 
service level agreements, trying to get customer service right, 
trying to get the technical people you need to fulfill the 
primary mission of the organization, the first thing that I 
would tell my client is, do not think about a big new system 
that expands your responsibilities before we fix the current 
plumbing, which I believe you are well qualified to do.
    Why shouldn't I look at all the calls for free filing as 
one of those at-risk projects for enterprise transformation, 
when 70 percent of the taxpayers are already eligible for Free 
File? If my data is correct, anybody making less than $73,000 a 
year, with a public-
private partnership that the IRS has today with tax filing 
entities--they already have it.
    So, even if you felt like you needed to get to 100 percent, 
why would you not figure out how to plus-up that relationship 
versus build your own and compete with the private sector that 
is already fulfilling the need?
    Commissioner Werfel. Senator, it is an excellent question, 
and you know, as you were talking, I was thinking, you 
absolutely have to keep the lights on. We have to be there to 
answer the calls. We also have to concurrently build 
incremental improvements----
    Senator Tillis. Yes, and I get it. And you are going to 
answer that question in a way that is going to satisfy me, so I 
am going to stipulate that you are going to give me a good 
answer, because I want to move on.
    Commissioner Werfel. Okay; yes, yes.
    Senator Tillis. So you are confirmed. Can you tell me 
whether or not you believe that the IRS has the authority, 
without new authorizing legislation and appropriations, to 
develop and implement a system for the service to prepare 
returns for taxpayers or allow them to file directly with the 
Service using the government-run software? I know there is $15 
million out there to study it, but----
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes, yes. No, I got this question 
earlier, and I think I committed to come back, because the 
remit under the Inflation Reduction Act is for us to assess the 
feasibility. Most often we are doing that, because----
    Senator Tillis. I suspect you do not have--I suspect--I 
hate cutting people off, but I want to stick to my time.
    Commissioner Werfel. I understand.
    Senator Tillis. I suspect that you do not have the 
appropriate authorizations and funding. And so now, we are 
going to take our attention away from your core mission--which 
is to transform the IRS--and say we also want you to focus on 
this other big project, which really does not have a lot to do 
with a lot of the KPIs you need to be working on now.
    So, last question related to this: recognizing the well-
documented leaks of taxpayer information and outdated computer 
technology, what is your assessment of the Service's technical 
capabilities to develop a complicated program that would 
actually do that? Or do you view that as an implementation risk 
for all the other big rocks that you need to turn over, now 
that you have been confirmed?
    Commissioner Werfel. Well, I think I mentioned during my 
confirmation hearing, in many ways it has to begin and end with 
data security. It is fundamental. People have to know and trust 
that their tax information----
    Senator Tillis. And we have some credibility issues to deal 
with there.
    Commissioner Werfel. There are mixed results. I have looked 
at it, and I said, ``Okay, tell us about our technology.'' 
Well, we did successfully defend a billion cyberattacks a year, 
and we need to continue on that path, because one successful 
attack----
    Senator Tillis. So let us harden the base that we are 
already the data stewards of.
    Commissioner Werfel. Exactly, yes.
    Senator Tillis. Prove that we can do that on a sustained 
basis, and then decide whether or not we want to dramatically 
increase that basis that would be subject to the same 
vulnerabilities.
    I know that your training and experience in the private 
sector put you in a position to say, ``You are asking me to 
move things ahead of the implementation time line that are 
standing in the critical paths of the things that I need to get 
done quickly.''
    And I think Congress needs to hear that, to understand that 
we do not do alla prima when it is technology, cybersecurity, 
everything else. If we do not focus on the primary goals so the 
taxpayers can be more satisfied, so that your customer 
satisfaction ratings can go up, then we are going to lose.
    The last thing--and I will submit a question for the 
record--but also on the tax gap----
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes.
    Senator Tillis. The left is going to say it is all about 
finding a handful of billionaires and trillionaires--if there 
is one; there will be one soon. And the right is going to say, 
all you are doing is hurting small businesses with the tax gap. 
But we do not have the information to even know that.
    I have asked a simple question: let us stratify all of the 
people who contribute to the tax gap, so that we have a 
distributional analysis of where we need to go after it. I 
cannot get an answer to that question. So why is it that I 
cannot get an answer when somebody says that we have a 
trillion-dollar tax gap, that I cannot have at least at the 
30,000-foot level, what bucket they fit into?
    Because I think we are talking past the fundamental issue. 
If somebody owes taxes--we could have a separate discussion 
about whether or not that tax should exist. But to the extent 
that it is in the tax code, then the taxpayers need to pay it, 
and then we can work on repealing it.
    But I really need more information at a more granular level 
than a trillion dollars, so that I can start applying a 
rationality test to some of the statements that are coming out 
of these committee hearings and out of the mouths of my 
colleagues, because I do not think that they actually have the 
data upon which they can base some of these assertions.
    I am going to--I am going to try and set up a meeting to 
come with you. Would you commit with me to have a meeting in 
your office, to go through your enterprise transformation plan?
    Commissioner Werfel. Absolutely.
    Senator Tillis. I look forward to it.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague. And just to give him 30 
seconds' worth of history, before you were on the committee, 
the reason that this tax gap issue was so relevant over the 
last year is because it was not some member of this committee, 
a Democrat or a Republican, it was Donald Trump's Commissioner 
who held the post that Mr. Werfel did.
    Mr. Rettig, Chuck Rettig, who had been a long-time auditor, 
was the one who made the statement (a) that he thought it could 
be up to a trillion dollars, and (b) it was his opinion that it 
was overwhelmingly due to those who are extremely wealthy 
because of the argument--and I certainly have made it--that for 
somebody who is a trucker, for example in Oregon or North 
Carolina, the government actually has the information in the 
vast majority of cases.
    Senator Tillis. That, Mr. Chair, is why I find it 
extraordinary that I cannot get an answer to my question. If 
people have made that assumption, then hopefully someone who 
made that statement actually had accurate data upon which to 
base that statement, and we do not have it. So whether it is 
the Trump administration, the Biden administration, Obama, 
Bush, Clinton, that does not matter to me.
    What matters to me is, I have not seen anybody share that 
with me. So all we have is a trillion-dollar number and a great 
political whipping boy. But I am not here to do that. I am here 
to solve the problem, even if it is applying a tax code that I 
disagree with.
    If you owe it, pay it. But let us get more strategic about 
the way we go about dealing with the--if we want to solve the 
problem, if we want to keep it at the high level and use it as 
a talking point in committee, that is great. But if we want to 
solve the problem, we have to have data to drive our 
priorities.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    The Chairman. And I would only say, my colleague is 
absolutely right in saying that it is smart to get more detail. 
And as you and I talked about, an example of a detail is our 
Credit Suisse investigation, where Credit Suisse got busted a 
decade ago and our investigators found they are doing exactly 
the same thing.
    So we have hard information on it. So, as you seek to get 
more detail on it, put me down. I am happy to work with you.
    Okay. Senator Barrasso?
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair. And, Mr. 
Werfel, thanks very much for being here.
    When you visited my office and when you were here for your 
nominating hearing, I asked you for your opinion on the funding 
priorities in this reckless tax and spending bill. I expressed 
my concern about $80 billion in additional funding for the IRS, 
and specifically, we talked about the enforcement amount versus 
the amount for taxpayer services--you know, $45 billion for 
enforcement, and only $3 billion for taxpayer services; so, the 
ratio of $15 of enforcement for every $1 of services, you know.
    In the IRS strategic operating plan for the spending of all 
of this money, the first objective that you list is to 
dramatically improve services to help taxpayers meet their 
obligations and receive the tax incentives for which they are 
eligible. Yet the money ratio is 15 to 1 enforcement over 
providing for services. This does not even include the 
additional $29-billion request for supplemental funding that 
you have come up with. So why would the IRS in its 
discretionary budget request, despite $45 billion in funding 
for enforcement, request again more money for enforcement, $5.9 
billion, than it is requesting for taxpayer services, $3.4 
billion?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes. So I am really appreciative of 
the question, because I think it is really important to break 
down our budget in a way that makes sense and can be 
understood. So our base budget pays for our day-to-day 
operations, the volume of things that come in both from a 
services and an enforcement standpoint.
    And as I explain in my testimony, if you look at our base 
budget over the last 10 or 15 years, it has been on a steep 
decline, while the U.S. population has grown and the tax laws 
and filers have all been much more complicated.
    So, when COVID hit, everything kind of broke, and at that 
point it was basically we could not do and continue to manage 
the way we would want, and services plummeted, and frankly 
audit rates plummeted.
    So what we need to do now is not think about the Inflation 
Reduction Act as, let us use that to patch the holes in our 
base budget, because what the Inflation Reduction Act does is 
that it spends for increased capacity so that we can improve 
operations. It's the difference, Senator, between just 
answering the calls versus having a callback option, having 
more digital channels, having more bots in the phone line so 
that people can get through quicker on things they can do in an 
automated way.
    So now to your question. Look, there is room for us to 
increase our capacity in enforcement. The stats on this are 
pretty eye-
opening. We only have today 2,600 staff who are responsible for 
assessing compliance with our highest-wealth taxpayers, and 
there are more than 390,000 high-wealth taxpayers.
    So, to give you a ratio, that is one IRS person for every 
150 high-wealth taxpayers, and these filings are big and 
complicated. They can be thousands of pages, tens of thousands 
of pages long. So look, if we started to move money out of 
enforcement into services, we would lose the ability to develop 
the capacity in that area, and that ratio would suffer.
    So the reality is, we need to do both. It is our job and 
our role to make sure that the tax system is operating 
effectively--answering the calls, improving the calls, but also 
making sure people pay what they owe.
    Senator Barrasso. Because, as we discussed, what I hear 
about in Wyoming is people who have called the IRS trying to 
get information, cannot get somebody to answer the phone, all 
of those issues. So you know, sticking to the issue of taxpayer 
service, when you look at the justification that you have 
printed for this fiscal year budget, it says ``unless the IRS 
realizes sustained increases in discretionary funding, service 
quality is going to continue to suffer.''
    I still do not know why the IRS, in its plea for more money 
in its budget request, is threatening to cut back taxpayer 
services instead of wanting more and more money for 
enforcement. So that is where I am on that.
    You know, the other issue is this long-awaited strategic 
plan for the so-called Inflation Reduction Act. It is well-
documented, very late, despite the extra time to pull together 
this highly anticipated plan. It is lacking in measurable 
targets. Basically, to summarize, the indicators said ``we will 
do better.''
    So The Wall Street Journal reported that your Deputy 
Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo referred to the plan, and he 
said, ``We don't want to be locked into numbers on a piece of 
paper.'' I would just tell you, Mr. Werfel, every taxpayer in 
this country believes that they are locked into numbers on a 
piece of paper, or they can go to jail. That is the difference.
    But if your Deputy Secretary thinks you do not want to be 
locked into numbers on a piece of paper, I have taxpayers all 
around Wyoming who have very similar concerns. So, thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    Senator Casey?
    Senator Casey. Mr. Chairman, thanks very much. 
Commissioner, good to be with you.
    I wanted to start with a program that is little known and 
probably underappreciated, but is enjoying, I think, great 
success. It is not a program that many people have heard about, 
so-called VITA, V-I-T-A, the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance 
program.
    I was just up in--not far from where I live in northeastern 
Pennsylvania--up in Stroudsburg, PA, the Pocono Mountains, and 
I met with a group of volunteers who work as part of VITA. And 
we know that last year VITA helped nearly 2 million Americans 
do their taxes and claim tax refunds for free.
    VITA tax returns are very, very accurate. Its volunteers 
have a 96-percent accuracy rate in preparing returns, while 
paid preparers have only a 40---40---percent accuracy rate 
according to a GAO study in 2014. So 96-percent accuracy rate 
versus 40 for paid preparers.
    Also, it is great; you get a great bang for our taxpayer 
buck. The IRS spends about only $21 per return prepared through 
VITA, and ten times that much, about $220 per return, through a 
tax preparer. So it is clear that VITA is a great deal for 
taxpayers, and we are getting good results from it.
    It saves taxpayers time and money and penalty fees, and it 
saves the IRS time in correcting incorrect returns. However, 
the IRS was not specific about its plans for the VITA program 
in the strategic plan. How does the IRS plan to use the 
infusion of funds from the Inflation Reduction Act to improve 
the volunteer taxpayer services in VITA?
    Commissioner Werfel. Thank you for the question, Senator, 
and I was very--I agree with you. It is a critically important 
and successful program, and I was pleased to see that the 
number of VITA-prepared returns increased. It was 1.8 million 
last tax season; it is over 2 million this year. So it is nice 
to see the program expanding.
    Part of what we are doing in the IRS is working more 
towards engaging these types of programs and stakeholders to 
meet taxpayers where they are, better understanding how we can 
lend that helping hand to taxpayers how they need it. Do they 
need more digital channels? Do they need more help from trusted 
partners like VITA? It absolutely has to be an area of 
investment.
    I can provide you with more details in terms of how we 
might scale and continue to invest in that program. But it 
absolutely is--you know, I am a personal champion of that 
program and will continue to work with them.
    Senator Casey. I appreciate that, and I want to salute you 
and your team on the great success you have had in providing 
better taxpayer service this year. The numbers are very 
compelling and irrefutable about better service and the 
investment that we made.
    Another area I want to ask you about is the bonus tax 
credits in the Inflation Reduction Act that reward companies 
that are either building new energy projects in coal 
communities--that's a provision that I worked on and pushed 
forward--or companies who use American manufactured products.
    So, we do not want to just improve supply chains generally; 
we do not want to simply create the clean energy future which 
we have to create, but we want to make sure that we can have 
the elements of those energy products, the content of them, 
made in America.
    We know that last year we gained almost 800,000 
manufacturing jobs, or I should say over 2 years, and we want 
to build on that. So we need strong domestic content rules to 
reward companies for building their energy components in 
America. It is not good enough to have a clean energy future if 
it is all going to be built by some other country, for example 
like China.
    However, the IRS and Treasury have not released guidance on 
how companies can claim these bonus credits for domestic 
content. So I would ask you, can you commit to working with me 
to release a strong and clear domestic content set of rules 
very soon?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes, absolutely. It is on--you know, I 
talked to the team. They are working on that very guidance 
document, along with others that are coming up in the next few 
months related to the energy provisions in the Inflation 
Reduction Act. So the answer is ``yes,'' Senator.
    Senator Casey. Commissioner, thanks very much. I will send 
a question or two for the record, but thank you.
    Commissioner Werfel. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Commissioner, we are waiting for a moment for 
Senator Cantwell. I do want to take up just for a minute, as we 
wait, this last point with respect to these communities that he 
is speaking of. In designing the clean energy tax credits--and 
this was something I was involved in for a full decade since 
Joe Manchin asked me to come to West Virginia--we said we were 
going to come up with a tax code that was technology-neutral, 
so as to be market-oriented and be a system that would reward 
those out there who would reduce carbon emissions. We had a 
number of Senators in this committee and elsewhere saying, ``I 
want to be part of the future. I want to be part of something 
better.''
    But we've got to make sure that we have tangible, concrete 
tools out there for communities that are serious about being 
part of the future and want to know how you can actually get it 
done. Senator Casey, with the effort, and we--I believe 
sometimes we called it the incentives program, sometimes we 
called it the bonus tax credit provision. We said very bluntly 
that these communities had to have an opportunity to be part of 
the future that Senator Casey and Senator Brown and others 
envisioned.
    So I want you to know, Senator Casey, we are going to be 
with you every step of the way until all of this is fully 
implemented. As you know, we have made progress on the other 
side of the coin, the energy communities. But you just keep 
raising it. I am going to be pushing for you every step of the 
way.
    Okay. Senator Cantwell has joined us, and----
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Please go ahead.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it. 
I appreciate it, this important hearing, particularly at this 
time.
    Last week, the IRS announced that nearly 1.5 million 
Americans have unclaimed tax refunds from 2019. In Washington 
State, the pandemic and other disruptions prevented as many as 
42,000 people from filing their 2019 tax return, leaving a 
total of $44 million in unclaimed refunds.
    When you were here last February, you said that the IRS 
should be able to communicate in a much more timely and 
aggressive fashion for taxpayers. I agreed with that. On April 
12th, the unclaimed refunds, you stated, frequently see 
students, part-time workers, and others with little time to 
really realize this. I know that to ensure these individuals 
have the money they are owed, they need to be ahead of the July 
17th deadline.
    So, what is the IRS doing to create greater public 
awareness for these unclaimed refunds, and do you have plans to 
reach out to individuals, to ensure they file before the July 
deadline?
    Commissioner Werfel. Yes, and I was pleased with the type 
of publicity that was created when we announced the July 
deadline. A lot of media outlets covered it and basically said, 
look, the IRS is informing you that you are eligible for a 
refund, and you should come, because we want people who are 
eligible, whether if it is for a credit or a refund, to claim 
it.
    Now, how do we continue to build on that outreach? There 
has to be more that we can do than just issuing a press 
release. We can use social media. We can engage with 
intermediaries and associations and groups, and this is part of 
the vision that we have for improved customer service.
    It is not just, ``Hey, we are here. We are going to answer 
your call. That is part of it, and that is critical. But it is 
also outreach, to meet taxpayers where they are, and so it is 
two-way. It is us here when you need us, whether it is an 
assistance center, a walk-in center, or the call. But also, we 
want to meet you where you are to help, to help small 
businesses meet their obligations.
    Senator Cantwell. How many taxpayers do you estimate are 
missing the Earned Income Tax Credit because they failed to 
file in 2019--overall, besides our State?
    Commissioner Werfel. I do not think we have an exact 
number, but I think we believe it is over a million people who 
could be claiming refunds who are not. But I will try to get 
you more precise numbers.
    Senator Cantwell. Yes, I think it--I mean, just given the 
numbers in our State, I would think that would easily make a 
million. Well again, I think we communicated also about this 
notion that, when it comes to owing money to the IRS, we have a 
lot of direct communication with people.
    So, I am for creating a more virtual experience for 
taxpayers, particularly by segmentation--these are the 
problems, these are the issues, right? I know you have 
frequently asked questions and things of that nature. But I 
just think the response from the IRS and direct communication 
with people on these issues would go a long way.
    Commissioner Werfel. I appreciate that.
    Senator Cantwell. All right.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    We are going to liberate you momentarily, Commissioner. I 
just want to give you my sense of where we are. I mean, the 
reason the tax gap is so important and I started talking about 
it--it has come up, you know, repeatedly--and my take, looking 
at all the data we have and what Chuck Rettig and others have 
said, is closing the tax gap cannot really be addressed unless 
you also beef up enforcement against those very wealthy 
individuals who are not paying taxes.
    Second, I think you made the case with respect to improving 
customer service, and I think you have done it in an 
appropriate way. You have not stood up and shouted, ``We are 
done; we are done.'' You said, ``Look, we are making a lot of 
progress here.'' It is high time that we did in terms of calls 
and shorter waiting times and reducing the backlog.
    I like the fact that we have made it clear we have a lot of 
heavy lifting to do. Nobody is having a victory parade today. 
Your comments with respect to auditing taxpayers, again with 
incomes below $400,000--we are going to clearly make progress 
compared to what we saw a few years ago, and I think that is an 
important objective as well.
    With the release of the strategic operating plan, we have 
an opportunity to really do this right in terms of making sure 
we protect people who should not be subjected to audits, and at 
the same time going after the high-income individuals and 
corporations and partnerships.
    One last point that I think I have kind of touched on is, 
when I look at this question of the high-fliers and people who 
have repeatedly skirted the law, I am especially focused on the 
IRS going after repeat tax evaders. People asked me when they 
heard about Credit Suisse, they said, ``Ron, you are kidding 
me. I read that they got busted just a few years ago, and their 
CEO came in and raised their hand and said `never going to 
happen again.' ''
    You cannot explain to taxpayers how you are not doing 
anything about it if it happens again and you basically--we 
actually gave them a discount on their penalties the first time 
because they made all these claims that, you know, we will be 
honest. So how you deal with these repeat tax evaders is 
particularly important to me.
    I want to close with three quick points. Tomorrow, the 
Finance members will have a briefing by the Commissioner, 
Commissioner Werfel, on the strategic operating plan. We thank 
you for giving the opportunity for members to ask additional 
questions.
    I and Senator Menendez both asked you today about this 
question of these racially biased audits. Very, very troubling, 
and you know, from the very first day I asked about whether it 
would be on time, and for a repeat response, you said, ``You 
bet it will be on time,'' which is going to be something 
members pay attention to because you are following through. 
With respect to that, we will follow through.
    And for the information of members, questions for the 
record are going to be due by 5 p.m. next Wednesday; that's 
April 26th.
    Commissioner Werfel. Mr. Chairman, before you gavel close, 
I just wanted to make one procedural point, which is, I 
mentioned to both you and Senator Crapo that after the plan was 
issued, we got questions from Congress--both authorizers and 
appropriators--with questions about numbers, and we have been 
providing information.
    As a result of providing that information, there is now 
available to you 10-year spend numbers over the life of the 
IRA, and more detailed FTE numbers over a 3-year window. But I 
realize that as we provide that information, it is not simple 
for you to know where it is. So we put together a compendium of 
that. I would like to introduce that for the record, so that 
you have a one-stop shop for it and the public can see it as 
well.
    The Chairman. Without objection, the welcome news that 
there will be a one-stop shop is introduced in the record at 
this point. We look forward to tomorrow as well. And again, I 
just want to thank you for saying you are going to be hands-on 
and you are going to follow through.
    [The compendium appears in the appendix beginning on p. 
62.]
    The Chairman. That is what the job is all about, and you 
are saying that is your focus.
    With that, we are adjourned.
    Commissioner Werfel. Thank you.
    [Whereupon, at 12:55 p.m., the hearing was concluded.]

                            A P P E N D I X

              Additional Material Submitted for the Record

                              ----------                              


                Prepared Statement of Hon. Mike Crapo, 
                       a U.S. Senator From Idaho
    Commissioner Werfel, thank you for testifying this morning, as well 
as for your conduct in these first few weeks of your tenure. I hope you 
will continue to be transparent, accessible, and willing to work with 
me and my colleagues--particularly regarding support for taxpayer 
services and modernizing outdated IT, which the House-passed IRS 
funding bill shows Republicans support.

    While not the focus of today's hearing, the IRS's recent 150-page 
response to Secretary Yellen's directive to deliver to her a 10-year 
operational plan for spending its Inflation Reduction Act funding 
requires comment.

    Secretary Yellen promised a plan that would allow the public and 
Congress to hold the IRS accountable for the project. While dense, what 
has been delivered is noticeably light on many essential attributes of 
a ``plan,'' and it would be extremely challenging to use the document 
to hold the IRS, Treasury Department, or anyone else accountable for 
any missteps.

    A few things it almost entirely lacks include: quantitative targets 
to measure against; backup data to analyze; and various key operational 
details--including, for example, who at the IRS or Treasury Department 
is ultimately responsible for making decisions on any particular issue.

    It does not give any detail on how the IRS will implement Secretary 
Yellen's $400,000 pledge--and details really matter here. It also does 
not estimate what any of the 42 ``initiatives'' or 190-odd ``key 
projects'' are expected to cost or clearly answer the basic question of 
which initiatives or key projects can be fully implemented with the $80 
billion in funding.

    What the document quietly admits is astonishing. Despite contrary 
rhetoric, the IRA did not give the IRS enough funding to fully realize 
the ``plan's'' vision--this despite having given the agency a slug of 
funding more than six times its typical annual budget.

    The IRS's annual budget justification goes further, asking for 15-
percent increases in the IRS's discretionary appropriations to make up 
in the short term for areas where the IRA funding falls far short, 
particularly in taxpayer services and IT modernization. The IRS's 
annual budget justification also warns that if Congress fails to 
increase future IRS discretionary budgets, on top of the $80 billion--
and in particular spend even more for taxpayer services and IT 
modernization--the IRS's future service delivery will actually suffer.

    Finally, the President's budget requests still more IRS funding for 
future enforcement efforts--$29.1 billion more. That is on top of the 
$80 billion. Americans rightly have a hard time understanding how an 
agency provided more than six times its annual funding can still claim 
poverty. And given that the plan the IRS delivered is not transparent 
and does not allow for any meaningful accountability, this plea is 
essentially for another blank check.

    I have heard some argue that future uncertainty prevents the IRS 
from making firm estimates beyond a fiscal year or two. Indeed, that 
sounds like a tacit admission that circumventing the annual 
appropriations process for the $80 billion was a huge ``spend first, 
plan later'' mistake. But this ``uncertainty'' excuse falls completely 
flat when one observes the countless other examples of long-term 
budget-, revenue-, and cost-estimating--both in the public and private 
sectors.

    When you last testified before us, you promised to regularly update 
the IRS's spending plan and solicit this committee's feedback. Based 
upon what has just been delivered, I strongly suggest you accelerate 
your timeline and return to this committee in short order with an 
actual plan.

    Returning to the subject of this hearing, my colleagues and I 
eagerly await discussing the IRS's annual discretionary budget request 
and current performance measures. I have learned more in the last few 
weeks about the sometimes-puzzling ways the IRS measures its own 
effectiveness, such as on answering phones. What I have learned would 
be more troubling if not for the hope that you will adhere to your 
promise to enhance the rigor and meaningfulness of the IRS's data 
collection and analysis.

    I recognize that you are only a few weeks into your tenure and are 
already facing momentous decisions that will likely have lasting 
consequences. I was encouraged by your prior commitments, which 
include: full and prompt transparency; utilizing best management 
practices; making decisions based on sound and unbiased data; ensuring 
the IRS is strictly nonpartisan; not making any policy decisions that 
are Congress's responsibility; and turning to Congress at every 
possible opportunity for guidance and authorization.

    How well you adhere to these promises will determine the legacy you 
leave the IRS and American taxpayers, as well as your relationship with 
Congress. I urge you to walk the straight course, set a positive 
trajectory and above all, keep the IRS out of partisan gamesmanship.

                                 ______
                                 
             Prepared Statement of Hon. Daniel I. Werfel, 
                 Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service
                              introduction
    Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of the committee, 
thank you for the opportunity to discuss the 2023 filing season and the 
IRS budget.

    I am honored to serve as the 50th IRS Commissioner and have the 
chance to lead a group of extremely dedicated and talented public 
servants at a pivotal moment in IRS history. My first few weeks as 
Commissioner have reinforced my belief in the importance of the IRS to 
the Nation, as I have witnessed the ongoing efforts of our workforce to 
fulfill the critical mission of administering the Nation's tax system. 
This includes administering the tax filing season, which has gone 
smoothly in terms of processing tax returns, the operation of our 
information technology systems and improvements in taxpayer service.

    As I begin my new role, I have a unique opportunity coming into the 
agency to bring a fresh perspective on our operations, examining them 
to determine where improvements can be made and what processes and 
controls need to be strengthened to better fulfill our mission. 
Ensuring a high-performing IRS is critical for our Nation, as the 
agency collects more than $4 trillion in revenues each year, generating 
about 96 percent of the funding that supports the Federal Government's 
operations--everything from roads and other infrastructure to education 
and the Nation's military.

    We greatly appreciate the funding provided by Congress in the 
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), which has already allowed us to 
make improvements in many areas, including our levels of service on the 
phones and in person during the 2023 filing season. In tandem with the 
IRS's annual discretionary budget, this critical, sustained multi-year 
funding will allow the agency to transform its operations--through 
improved taxpayer service, smarter enforcement, upgraded technology and 
better data security.

    As we continue implementing the IRA, we welcome congressional 
oversight of our efforts. I believe in the oversight role of this 
committee and others, and I will always strive to be accountable to you 
for the investments we make using the IRA funding. Accountability will 
be essential for the IRS to maintain public trust.

    We must be transparent about our work, be responsible stewards of 
the taxpayer dollars we receive, and collaborate with Congress and 
other oversight entities. A good example of how we are striving for 
better transparency is the IRA Strategic Operating Plan we issued 
earlier this month. This plan lays out our objectives, initiatives and 
milestones for transformation of the agency, and will be described in 
more detail later in this testimony. In all of our efforts, our 
ultimate goals are to provide all taxpayers with world-class customer 
service and implement the tax code in a way that safeguards the rights 
of taxpayers and promotes tax fairness.
                    update on the 2023 filing season
    I am pleased to report the 2023 tax filing season, which began on 
time on January 23rd, has gone well. Through April 7th, the IRS 
received more than 101 million individual Federal tax returns and 
issued approximately 69 million refunds totaling more than $198 
billion. It is important to note that, although we are now past the 
April 18th filing deadline, the work of the filing season continues, as 
IRS employees continue to process tax returns, including amended 
returns and returns for which taxpayers have requested an extension 
through mid-October.

    This filing season, following the infusion of IRA funding, the IRS 
has been able to provide taxpayers with a substantially better 
experience than they have seen for several years. Notably, we have 
answered more calls from taxpayers seeking our help than in 2022, and 
we have significantly reduced their wait time on the phones, provided 
more in-person assistance at our Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) 
around the country, and provided more online services for taxpayers who 
prefer using this service channel.

    Examples of the improvements seen this filing season include:

          Phone service. We hired more than 5,000 additional customer 
        service representatives (CSR) for our toll-free lines. That 
        allowed us to achieve a level of service (LOS) on the phones 
        averaging 87 percent this filing season through April 7th. This 
        is a significant increase from approximately 16 percent for the 
        same period last year. Our CSRs have answered over 2 million 
        more calls this filing season compared to this time last year 
        during filing season. The IRA resources also have allowed us to 
        reduce the average time it takes to answer a taxpayer call to 
        about 4 minutes, compared with 27 minutes a year ago.
          In-person assistance. We have already hired hundreds of new 
        employees for our TACs, with more to come. So far this year 
        through April 7th, TACs have provided face-to-face service to 
        more than 474,000 taxpayers, compared with 361,000 during the 
        same period last year. IRA funding has also allowed us to 
        reopen many TACs that were closed due to lack of resources. As 
        of early April, 334 of our 362 TACs are open, with 28 closed or 
        not staffed. That compares with August 2022, when we had 317 
        TACs open out of a total of 359, with 42 closed or not staffed. 
        Additionally, again this year, we have had special Saturday 
        openings of certain TACs in dozens of locations across the 
        country to assist taxpayers.
          Electronically filed forms. We launched an online portal, 
        the Information Returns Intake System (IRIS) for businesses to 
        electronically file 1099-series forms, saving time and effort 
        for both businesses that issue these forms and the taxpayers 
        that receive them. Though available to businesses of all sizes, 
        IRIS is especially helpful to small businesses that currently 
        submit their 1099 forms on paper.
          Scanned returns. We began a new initiative called Digital 
        Intake to scan paper tax returns to save time and effort for 
        taxpayers and businesses, as well as for the IRS. We have 
        scanned more than 410,000 paper Forms 940, Employer's Annual 
        Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) Return, since the start of 
        2023. In March, we expanded this effort to include scanning of 
        Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, and Form 941, 
        Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return. We hope to scan more 
        than a million forms this year, a major accomplishment for the 
        agency.
          Easier response to IRS notices. We gave taxpayers the option 
        to respond to a range of IRS notices by uploading documents 
        electronically using our Document Upload Tool. At the current 
        stage of this ongoing effort, we estimate this can help serve 
        more than 500,000 taxpayers each year who respond to these 
        notices, which include military personnel serving in combat 
        areas and recipients of important tax credits such as the 
        Earned Income Tax Credit.
          Faster refunds on amended returns. This filing season, for 
        the first time, taxpayers who electronically filed Form 1040-X 
        to amend their tax returns had the option to choose direct 
        deposit for their refund--which can save weeks over delivery of 
        a paper refund check. This helps a significant segment of 
        taxpayers, as a total of 3 million amended returns are filed 
        each year.
           transforming the irs: ira strategic operating plan
    The IRA legislation provides the IRS with a unique opportunity to 
transform our agency and the taxpayer experience over the next decade. 
To ensure we are on the right path in implementing the IRA, we recently 
issued our Strategic Operating Plan, which provides a long-term vision 
for how we will use these historic investments to better serve 
taxpayers. This robust plan provides the roadmap for the IRS to enhance 
the taxpayer experience, improve fairness in tax administration by 
reducing the tax gap and strengthen our operations to be more 
efficient.

    By implementing the plan, the IRS will provide the American public 
the customer experience they deserve, modernize outdated technology and 
tools for taxpayers, and deliver more effective enforcement of tax laws 
that apply to high-income taxpayers, large corporations, and complex 
partnerships which do not pay the taxes they legally owe. This plan, 
which IRS and Treasury staff started working on in advance of my 
confirmation as IRS Commissioner, lays out a solid foundation for 
transforming the IRS. This vision is achievable with the long-term 
funding provided by the Inflation Reduction Act and assuming the IRS 
receives sufficient discretionary funding each year through the annual 
appropriations process.

    Taken as a whole, the plan provides a vision for the future of the 
IRS as an organization that will deliver:

          A world-class customer service operation where taxpayers can 
        engage with the IRS in a fully digital manner if they choose, 
        where helpful tools for taxpayers to navigate the complexity of 
        our tax laws are deployed and then refreshed and updated 
        regularly based on taxpayer feedback, and where our customer 
        service workforce is maintained at the right size and with the 
        right resources and training to always be ready to meet the 
        taxpayer demand for assistance.
          New capacities, including specialized skills, to unpack the 
        complex filings of high-income taxpayers, large corporations, 
        and partnerships so Americans have confidence that all 
        taxpayers, regardless of means, are doing their part to meet 
        their responsibilities under our tax laws.
          Modern technology that provides taxpayers with increased 
        confidence that data is secure and that we are prepared and 
        able to more rapidly meet new requirements or responsibilities 
        as they emerge in the future.

    The plan is organized around five objectives:

          Dramatically improve services to help taxpayers meet their 
        obligations and receive the tax incentives for which they are 
        eligible.
          Quickly resolve taxpayer issues when they arise.
          Focus expanded enforcement on taxpayers with complex tax 
        filings and high-dollar noncompliance to address the tax gap.
          Deliver cutting-edge technology, data, and analytics to 
        operate more effectively.
          Attract, retain, and empower a highly skilled, diverse 
        workforce and develop a culture that is better equipped to 
        deliver results for taxpayers.

    The IRS that emerges from this plan will deliver an improved 
taxpayer experience that mirrors what best-in-class public and private 
organizations now provide. Among the improvements, taxpayers and tax 
professionals will have the ability to interact with the IRS in the way 
they prefer, whether online, over the phone, or in person. This 
approach will also help the IRS reach more underserved communities, 
providing the assistance to taxpayers in the ways that they want and 
deserve.

    Along with improving the taxpayer experience, another component of 
the plan involves enforcement to ensure fairness in tax administration 
and address the tax gap. This focus will not be a concern to compliant 
taxpayers; the emphasis will be on pursuing those who do not follow the 
tax law. In conducting these enforcement activities, we are committed 
to following the Treasury Department's directive not to increase audit 
rates relative to historical levels for small businesses and households 
earning $400,000 per year or less.

    Instead, our compliance efforts will focus on complex issues and 
high-dollar noncompliance. This is important, because over the past 
several years, our ability to enforce the tax laws against non-
compliant taxpayers with complex returns--including large corporations, 
complex partnerships and high-wealth individuals--has been hampered by 
a lack of resources. We have been unable to audit a reasonable 
percentage of these groups, and we are often limited in the issues 
reviewed among those we do audit. Many of these taxpayers can afford to 
spend large amounts to drag out proceedings unnecessarily or bury the 
government in paper, leaving us unable to assure a reasonable degree of 
compliance with the laws passed by Congress.

    Funding provided under the IRA will allow us to hire and train more 
specialists across a wide range of complex areas needed to assist with 
the audits of the complex issues we will be focusing on. For example, 
we will focus the IRA enforcement resources on hiring the accountants, 
attorneys, engineers, economists, and data scientists needed to pursue 
high-income and high-wealth individuals, complex partnerships, and 
large corporations that are not paying the taxes they owe. Using 
improved data and analytics, we will enhance detection of noncompliance 
and increase enforcement activities for such high-risk and novel 
emerging issues as digital assets, listed transactions, and certain 
international issues. All of this will be done with an eye toward 
fairness and always respecting taxpayer rights.

    It is important to note that our plan to focus on these types of 
complex issues will be resource intensive. But achieving our goals will 
result not only in a fairer tax system, but also in benefits for 
taxpayers and the Nation, because detecting and stopping noncompliance 
in these areas would result in significant additional revenues and 
reduce the deficit.

    This plan is only the beginning of our work. As we stand up the IRS 
Transformation and Strategy Office and begin specific implementation 
sequencing and planning efforts, we will provide additional information 
to the Treasury, to our oversight bodies, and to the American people 
outlining the details of our transformation.

    We will hold ourselves accountable to achieving the plan vision by 
regularly monitoring and reporting to Congress on our progress. We will 
also update the plan's details as we learn more about what works and as 
the operating environment changes. More important than any detail in 
this plan, however, is our responsibility to improve the customer 
experience we provide to the American people. The IRS looks forward to 
demonstrating how the actions under this plan will translate into real 
improvements in how taxpayers engage with us and in the assistance we 
provide. The plan articulates how, through both service and technology 
enhancements, the experience of the future will look and feel much 
different from the IRS of today.

    I also want to note that the IRS will continue looking for feedback 
from Congress, from people inside and outside the tax community, 
including taxpayers, as we work to put these changes in place. This 
feedback is important to make sure that we strengthen IRS operations 
and transform the agency to serve taxpayers and the Nation.
              the president's fiscal year (fy) 2024 budget
    The President's FY 2024 budget proposal for the IRS provides $14.1 
billion in discretionary appropriations, an increase of $1.8 billion, 
or about 15 percent, above the 2023 enacted level of $12.3 billion. 
This request provides funding to maintain basic IRS service, operations 
and technology functions, which, when paired with IRA funding, will 
ultimately lead to increased voluntary tax compliance. The request also 
aims to ensure the IRS stays current with paper inventory and can 
provide both live phone assistance and in-person service; facilitates 
optimal oversight of high-income, large corporate and large partnership 
tax returns; and maintains digital tools to enable efficient and 
cleaner communication with taxpayers.

    As noted above, the historic funding provided by Congress under the 
IRA will allow us to transform tax administration and taxpayer service 
in ways not possible under the annual budget alone. Years of 
underfunding left the IRS understaffed and unable to deliver the modern 
customer service experience taxpayers deserve, and also left the agency 
with challenges operating on outdated information technology systems 
and unable to keep up with a changing economy. But the transformative 
investments to be made using IRA funding can only be put to work if 
Congress continues annual funding for steady-state maintenance of 
agency operations.

    The IRS's plan for IRA implementation assumes that IRA funds will 
support transformation efforts, while day-to-day operations would 
continue to be supported by annual appropriations. Any reduction in 
annual discretionary funds--including failing to sufficiently provide 
for inflationary increases to maintain current levels--would require 
IRA funding to be shifted to general operations. This would mean worse 
service for the taxpayer.

    The President's FY 2024 budget requests total program increases of 
approximately $1 billion, including the following:

          Improving the Taxpayer Experience: $41.4 million. This 
        investment will allow the IRS to continue helping taxpayers and 
        tax practitioners meet their tax obligations. Funding will be 
        used to maintain and expand the number of digital assistance 
        options taxpayers may use to access resources for complying 
        with the tax laws. Additional online self-service options to be 
        funded include account updates, secure messaging and notice 
        delivery, and refund tracking.
          Green Tax Credit Implementation: $105.6 million, which will 
        be used to support the various IRA tax credit provisions. This 
        funding will supplement IRA funding for this area to develop 
        and modify forms, instructions and notifications; conduct 
        taxpayer education and research; address increased taxpayer 
        demand for assistance with the new credits; and ensure 
        compliance with tax credit requirements.
          Improving Phone Level of Service (LOS)/Reducing Paper 
        Inventory: $267.2 million. This investment will enable the IRS 
        to achieve and maintain high LOS performance outcomes and 
        exceed FY 2023 levels. This is important, given that taxpayer 
        research continues to indicate phone service is a preferred 
        service channel. Research also shows that inadequate phone 
        service causes taxpayers to increase usage of other service 
        channels, such as paper correspondence, so keeping phone LOS 
        high will reduce incoming paper inventory.
          Restoration of Staffing Levels: $167.6 million. This 
        investment will restore discretionary funding for the IRS 
        staffing levels in place prior to enactment of the IRA. While 
        the IRA provided the IRS with significant resources for a 
        transformative expansion of its tax enforcement and taxpayer 
        services efforts, there remains a need for a reversal of the 
        multi-year inflation-adjusted decline in the IRS's foundational 
        staffing resources.
          Sustaining IT Capabilities: $55.9 million. The IRS intends 
        to use funds provided under the American Rescue Plan Act and 
        the IRA to accelerate the modernization of its core 
        foundational technology. But it must continue to operate the 
        existing core tax processing system while planning and 
        executing the modernization initiatives. This funding will 
        allow the IRS to fund operations and maintenance of these key 
        existing systems.
          Business Systems Modernization: $289.6 million. This 
        investment will restore discretionary IT modernization funding 
        to help IRS continue to develop into a 21st-century tax 
        administration. Although the IRA provides funding for business 
        systems modernization, sustained annual discretionary funding 
        is necessary for the envisioned transformative modernization to 
        be realized and sustained going forward.
        legislative proposals in the president's fy 2024 budget
    Along with the funding requested in the President's FY 2024 budget 
request, we are also requesting legislative proposals that would 
improve tax administration, including the following:

          Direct Hire Authority and Streamlined Critical Pay. The 
        President's Budget includes two administrative provisions 
        within the appropriations language designed to expand Direct 
        Hire Authority (DHA) and provide the ability to offer 
        Streamlined Critical Pay (SCP) to certain new hires to 
        accelerate IRS hiring efforts. DHA provides the ability to 
        expedite the normal hiring process to hire more efficiently 
        when there is a severe shortage of highly qualified candidates 
        or during a critical hiring need. DHA has helped the IRS 
        address the backlog of paper returns and other issues. Expanded 
        DHA will help ensure hiring delays are not an obstacle to 
        implementing plans for utilizing IRA resources and achieving 
        broad mission-related functions. SCP authority gives the IRS a 
        management tool to quickly recruit and retain a limited number 
        of employees with high levels of expertise in technical or 
        professional fields that are crucial to the success of the 
        IRS's transformative efforts.
          Information reporting by financial institutions and digital 
        asset brokers for purposes of exchange of information. Over 
        time, the U.S. has established a broad network of information 
        exchange relationships with other jurisdictions based on 
        established international standards. The information obtained 
        through those relationships has been central to recent 
        successful IRS enforcement efforts against offshore tax 
        evasion. The ability to exchange information reciprocally is 
        particularly important in connection with the implementation of 
        the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Currently, 
        however, the U.S. provides less information to foreign 
        governments than we receive from them. The proposal would 
        expand reporting by financial institutions and digital asset 
        brokers in a number of ways--for example, by requiring 
        financial institutions to report the account balance for all 
        financial accounts maintained at a U.S. office and held by 
        foreign persons. These new reporting requirements would enable 
        the IRS to provide equivalent levels of information to 
        cooperative foreign governments in appropriate circumstances to 
        support their efforts to address tax evasion by their 
        residents. The proposal would be effective for returns required 
        to be filed after December 31, 2025.
          Require reporting by certain taxpayers on foreign digital 
        asset accounts. Section 6038D(b) of the Internal Revenue Code 
        contains an annual reporting requirement for individuals in 
        regard to two categories of foreign financial assets, but there 
        is no reporting requirement under this section for digital 
        assets. Against this backdrop, tax compliance and enforcement 
        with respect to digital assets is a rapidly growing problem. 
        The global nature of the digital assets market offers 
        opportunities for U.S. taxpayers to conceal assets and taxable 
        income by using offshore digital asset exchanges and wallet 
        providers. The proposal would amend section 6038D(b) to require 
        reporting with respect to a new third category of asset: that 
        is, any account that holds digital assets maintained by a 
        foreign digital asset exchange or other foreign digital asset 
        service provider. Reporting would be required only for 
        taxpayers that hold an aggregate value of all three categories 
        of assets in excess of $50,000. The proposal would be effective 
        for returns required to be filed after December 31, 2023.
          Extend the statute of limitations for certain tax 
        assessments. Section 6501 of the Internal Revenue Code 
        generally requires the IRS to assess a tax within 3 years after 
        the filing of a return. But for complex audits in the largest 
        cases, critical issues may not be identified until late in the 
        process of an examination, and in many cases these issues 
        cannot be pursued further due to time and resource constraints. 
        The proposal would amend section 6501 to extend the 3-year 
        statute of limitations to 6 years if a taxpayer omits from 
        gross income more than $100 million on a return. This change 
        would give the IRS enhanced agility and flexibility in 
        evaluating and staffing its case inventory and appropriately 
        allocating its limited enforcement resources.
          Increase oversight of paid tax return preparers. Paid tax 
        return preparers have an important role in tax administration 
        because they assist taxpayers in complying with their 
        obligations under the tax laws. The proposal would amend title 
        31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide the Secretary with 
        explicit authority to regulate all paid preparers of Federal 
        tax returns, including by establishing mandatory minimum 
        competency standards. The proposal would be effective on the 
        date of enactment.
          Expand and increase penalties for return preparation and e-
        filing. Inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers 
        harms taxpayers through the filing of inaccurate returns, 
        erroneous refunds and credits and personal tax return 
        noncompliance. Tax return preparer misconduct continues, in 
        part, because the amounts of the penalties under current law do 
        not adequately promote voluntary compliance. The proposal would 
        increase the amount of the tax penalties that apply to paid tax 
        return preparers for willful, reckless or unreasonable 
        understatements, as well as for forms of noncompliance that do 
        not involve an understatement of tax.
          Expand authority to require electronic filing for forms and 
        returns. Under this proposal, electronic filing would be 
        required for returns filed by taxpayers reporting larger 
        amounts or that are complex business entities, including: (1) 
        income tax returns of individuals with gross income of $400,000 
        or more; (2) income, estate, or gift tax returns of all related 
        individuals, estates, and trusts with assets or gross income of 
        $400,000 or more in any of the 3 preceding years; (3) 
        partnership returns for partnerships with assets or any item of 
        income of more than $10 million in any of the 3 preceding 
        years; (4) partnership returns for partnerships with more than 
        10 partners; (5) returns of real estate investment trusts, real 
        estate mortgage investment conduits, regulated investment 
        companies and all insurance companies; and (6) corporate 
        returns for corporations with $10 million or more in assets or 
        more than 10 shareholders. Further, electronic filing would be 
        required for the following forms: (1) Forms 8918, ``Material 
        Advisor Disclosure Statement''; (2) Forms 8886, ``Reportable 
        Transaction Disclosure Statement;'' (3) Forms 1042, ``Annual 
        Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign 
        Persons''; (4) Forms 8038-CP, ``Return for Credit Payments to 
        Issuers of Qualified Bonds''; and (5) Forms 8300, ``Report of 
        Cash Payments Over $10,000 Received in a Trade or Business.'' 
        Return preparers that expect to prepare more than 10 
        corporation income tax returns or partnership returns would be 
        required to file such returns electronically. The Secretary 
        would also be authorized to determine which additional returns, 
        statements, and other documents must be filed in electronic 
        form in order to ensure the efficient administration of the 
        internal revenue laws without regard to the number of returns 
        that a person files during a year.
          Improve reporting for payments subject to backup 
        withholding. The proposal would treat all information returns 
        subject to backup withholding similarly. Specifically, the IRS 
        would be permitted to require payees of any reportable payments 
        to furnish their TINs to payors under penalty of perjury. The 
        proposal would be effective for payments made after December 
        31, 2023.
                               conclusion
    Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of the committee, 
thank you again for the opportunity to update you on the filing season 
and IRS operations. This has been a strong filing season for the IRS, 
and the future holds great promise for the agency and the taxpayers we 
serve. As Commissioner, I am committed to leading the IRS's 
transformation efforts in close collaboration with this committee, and 
I look forward to working with you to achieve a more modern and high-
performing IRS, which will better serve taxpayers and our Nation.

      Questions Submitted for the Record to Hon. Daniel I. Werfel
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
    Question. The IRS Strategic Operating Plan for IRA funding says the 
IRS will help taxpayers avoid errors at the point of filing, such as 
math errors, missing forms, or missing income. Can you expand on how 
this would work?

    Answer. Initiative 2.1 of the Strategic Operating Plan (SOP) aims 
to identify potential issues as early as possible during filing to help 
taxpayers get it right the first time. When a taxpayer submits a tax 
return electronically, we will systematically check for errors in real 
time, match the return against available third-party and internal data, 
and evaluate the taxpayer's eligibility for credits and deductions. We 
will explain each potential issue in plain language in notifications 
that could be delivered to taxpayers or preparers directly or through 
their tax software. Each notification will include instructions on how 
to correct the issue and resubmit the return. For example, beginning in 
2024, taxpayers will be able to receive prompts to correct simple 
processing errors at the timing of filing, ensuring refunds are 
delivered quickly. In the future, taxpayers will receive real time 
notifications. Implementation will require improvements to technology 
and data, as well as testing and policy development to continue to 
protect taxpayer privacy and security.

    Question. At the hearing you mentioned that some people don't file 
returns even if they're eligible to claim a refund of the EITC. The 
plan says the IRS will ``develop tailored treatments to help taxpayers 
claim missed incentives for which they are eligible.'' Can you explain 
how this would work?

    Answer. Currently, the IRS identifies taxpayers who filed tax 
returns but did not claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the 
Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) even though they seem to meet the 
eligibility criteria. Throughout the filing season, the IRS reviews tax 
returns as we receive them. To avoid unnecessarily burdening taxpayers, 
we use all data sources available to determine potential eligibility. 
For example, we check the validity of taxpayers' Social Security 
numbers (SSNs) and the SSNs of their qualifying children listed on 
their tax returns. In addition, we check other requirements based on 
age, income, foreign earned income and investment income.

    The IRS sends notifications to taxpayers when system filters flag 
them for potential eligibility. We use a series of computer paragraph 
(CP) notices to inform these taxpayers of potential eligibility for 
credits. We send the CP08 notice for the ACTC for qualifying children, 
the CP09 notice for the EITC for qualifying children, and the CP27 
notice for the EITC without qualifying children. Typically, we send 
these notifications within two to 4 weeks of the filing date. The 
notices explain to taxpayers the reason they are receiving the notice 
and provide a simple worksheet for them to complete and return 
electronically or by mail. Once we receive the worksheet, the IRS 
calculates the amount of credit and issues a refund to the taxpayer. 
Based on information available at filing, we issue notices to taxpayers 
who are apparently eligible for a refundable credit, but do not claim 
it on their return. We issued a total of more than one million of the 
above notices for tax year 2021.

    The IRS and the Treasury Department also previously leveraged the 
``Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here Tool'' to create an enhanced 2022 
non-filer portal that allowed individuals to claim the EITC, as well as 
the CTC and 2021 recovery rebate credit. The 2022 non-filer portal 
leveraged lessons that the Treasury Department and the IRS learned from 
prior non-filer portals to create a significantly enhanced electronic 
process for individuals not otherwise required to file 2021 Federal 
income tax returns to claim those expanded Federal tax benefits, and a 
refund of withheld Federal income tax for taxable year 2021.

    We will continue to engage with Federal agencies whose programs 
(Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for 
Needy Families, Federal Student Aid, etc.) can provide information on 
life changes that could impact refundable credit eligibility The 
interactions taxpayers have with those programs and data collected by 
the administering agency will inform the IRS on projects to improve the 
administration of refundable credits, such as creating proactive alerts 
as referenced in the IRS SOP Initiative 1.8 and helping taxpayers 
accurately claim credits that they are eligible for as referenced in 
IRS SOP Initiative 1.9.

    The IRS pursues a variety of efforts to ensure those taxpayers 
eligible for refundable credits can receive them with minimal burden. 
We leverage internal and external stakeholders in carrying out a robust 
outreach and education program to reach the approximately 4.3 million 
non-claimants. EITC Awareness Day, for example, is an annual collection 
of local events across the country where the IRS invites community 
organizations, elected officials, State and local governments, and 
other entities throughout the Nation to raise awareness of EITC 
publications and online tools. We also collaborate with members of the 
private, public, and nonprofit sectors by hosting the Refundable Credit 
Summit, an annual gathering where IRS executives share current 
modernization efforts and updates to IRS forms and publications. The 
IRS's Stakeholder Partnership, Education, and Communication 
organization leads outreach activities at the summit. The summit also 
includes breakout sessions of the Refundable Credits Participation and 
Software Development Working groups to strategize future awareness and 
compliance approaches. We further engage with the public by 
collaborating with State and local municipalities and presenting 
information at the National Tax Forums, as well as conferences such as 
the Latino Tax Festival. Partnering with information technology and our 
online services organization, we have created tools and content on 
IRS.gov dedicated to EITC such as EITC Central (https://
www.eitc.irs.gov/) and the EITC Assistant (https://www.irs.gov/credits-
deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/use-the-eitc-
assistant).

                                 ______
                                 
               Questions Submitted by Hon. John Barrasso
    Question. In the Internal Revenue Service Inflation Reduction Act 
Strategic Operating Plan, it says that $3.9 billion will be needed to 
implement the energy tax incentives from Public Law 117-169. This is 
far above the $500 million given to the IRS for this specific purpose.

    How much is the IRS pulling from taxpayer services to implement the 
energy tax portion of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act? How is the 
IRS using existing dollars to come up with $3.9 billion and where are 
those dollars coming from, specifically?

    Answer. The IRS estimates it will need about 1,800 Customer Service 
Representatives annually beginning in Fiscal Year 2024 to handle phone 
calls associated with the energy security tax provisions included in 
the Inflation Reduction Act. To fund these positions through 
implementation, we plan to use the $500 million in Energy Security 
appropriations and estimate requiring an additional $1.2 billion, which 
could come from the IRA Taxpayer Services appropriations. This would 
further speed the funding cliff for Taxpayer Services. Additionally, 
the IRS anticipates using $1.3 billion in IRA Enforcement 
appropriations to fund approximately 480 legal and compliance 
enforcement staff and reimbursable agreement costs with the Department 
of Energy, as well as about $900 million in IRA Operations Support 
appropriations to fund required support staff, information technology 
costs, rent, and facilities costs.

    Question. In the Internal Revenue Service's budget justification, 
the IRS says, ``. . . unless the IRS realizes sustained increases in 
discretionary funding, service quality will continue to suffer.''

    In this situation, would the IRS first look to cut back on 
providing taxpayer services, instead of enforcement? If so, please 
explain the reasoning behind this decision.

    Answer. The IRS delivered dramatically improved service in filing 
season 2023. Thanks for the 5,000 new hires made possible by IRA 
resources, IRS customer service representatives answered more than 6.5 
million taxpayer calls this year, 2.4 million more calls with live 
assistance since the start of the year through April 7th, compared to 
the same period in 2022. The IRS cut phone wait times to 4 minutes, 
down from 27 minutes in filing season 2022. The IRS achieved an 87-
percent Level of Service (LOS) with live assistance this filing season. 
This is a more than fivefold increase in LOS over filing season 2022.

    IRS discretionary funding is split into four discrete 
appropriations--Taxpayer Services, Enforcement, Operations Support, and 
Business Systems Modernization--and the IRS has some ability to move 
funds across these appropriations as prescribed in Administrative 
section 101 of our appropriations bill. On its own, the current level 
of discretionary resources for Taxpayer Services is insufficient to 
provide the service quality taxpayers deserve. As a result, the IRS 
plans to use IRA resources to supplement appropriated Taxpayer Services 
funds to continue the high levels of customer service that it achieved 
this year. If taxpayer services discretionary funding increases are not 
appropriated, the IRS anticipates exhausting Taxpayer Services IRA 
funding by FY 2025. Without sustained long-term increases in taxpayer 
service funding, many taxpayers will be unable to reach a 
representative on the phone for assistance in future years.

    Question. Public Law 117-169 provided $15 million to conduct a 
study on a possible IRS run direct filing initiative. Though the IRS 
has no statutory authority to prepare or directly assist taxpayers in 
preparing returns as envisioned by the direct filing initiative, a 
direct filing initiative would greatly expand the IRS and its 
authority. It would also make the IRS a one-stop shop as tax preparer, 
tax collector, and tax enforcer.

    Will the report include an unbiased estimate about the cost of 
creating the program and the projected annual cost of maintaining such 
a program over an expanded period (e.g., 2-, 5-, and 10-year 
estimates)?

    Answer. The IRS's Direct File Report to Congress includes an 
unbiased estimate on the cost of creating and maintaining such a 
program on an annual basis. The cost estimates for the Direct File 
report are based on IRS subject matter experts' experience with 
launching new IRS digital services, and the experience of other digital 
projects from across the Federal Government.

    The cost estimates recognize that providing a Direct File service 
is not a one-time cost. As with most IRS systems, it will need to 
provide ongoing taxpayer support and to keep pace with changes to tax 
law. Therefore, the report includes the cost of building a long-term 
team necessary to develop and maintain Direct File. That team would 
include both Federal employees and contractors.

    The intent of the estimates in the report is twofold. We provide 
Congress with a general estimate of the cost of such a system, 
including the range of uncertainty of such costs. In addition, the 
estimates show the effect of different assumptions, including the 
complexity of the supported tax situations and uptake by taxpayers. In 
particular, we see that costs increase with the number of users, mainly 
due to the cost of providing customer support.

    Question. What steps were taken to ensure the study is free from 
bias so as to give American taxpayers a clear, honest picture of the 
positive and negative factors of the IRS running a direct file program?

    Answer. In its report, the IRS covers both the benefits and 
operational challenges that it will have to consider and overcome if we 
move forward with a direct file system. Further, as required by the 
IRA, the report includes the opinion of an independent third party that 
provides an independent, external perspective on the IRS's ability to 
run a direct file program.

    Question. What steps would be taken to deal with the inherent 
conflicts of interest in having the Nation's tax collecting and 
enforcement authority also be in charge of preparation independent of 
any study?

    Answer. Running a direct file system does not create a conflict of 
interest for the IRS. Authority for the IRS to run a direct electronic 
filing option is not in question as the IRS possesses the authority to 
develop and run such a system. There is substantial precedent for the 
IRS providing tax preparation assistance and advice to taxpayers to 
meet their tax filing obligations and complete their returns 
accurately, such as through the Tele-File program, that allowed 
taxpayers to file simple tax returns by telephone. The IRS also offers 
individualized tax preparation assistance by phone, through calculators 
and other tools on its website, through formal private letter rulings, 
and by partnering with third-party volunteer organizations including 
those participating in the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA)/Tax 
Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) programs to provide tax advice. We 
also launched the new Information Returns Intake System (IRIS) 
application this year, allowing payers to file Forms 1099 
electronically.

    Direct file offers taxpayers an additional option allowing 
taxpayers to accurately and directly file returns for free with the 
IRS. Taxpayers can still use commercial tax filing software, 
professional preparation services, or other options.

    Question. What is the agency's current view on its ability to 
create, manage, and maintain a direct filing program?

    Answer. As the IRS discusses in its report, while there are 
operational challenges, we have the capacity to create, manage, and 
maintain a direct file program.

    Question. On April 19th Commissioner Werfel explained that the 
pledge applies to taxpayers with ``total positive income'' in excess of 
$400,000, and the ``historical level'' means the audit rate on 2018 tax 
returns. It was also reported Commissioner Werfel opened the 
possibility that the IRS would revisit that audit rate some years down 
the road but doubted that the threshold would rise to ``any historical 
average'' for a long time.

    Why was ``Total Positive Income'' selected and not another measure 
(e.g., adjusted gross income)? What forms, schedules, and lines will be 
added to calculate Total Positive Income? Could you expand on your 
comment about changing the audit rate for those making $400,000 or 
less, including if such an adjustment could increase the audit rate for 
those making $400,000 or less? What factors could increase the 
probability that audit rates for those making $400,000 or less would 
rise?

    Answer. Since 1981, the IRS has used Total Positive Income (TPI) as 
a method to group individual tax returns (Form 1040). The IRS's 
computer system currently computes TPI at the time returns are 
processed, so no new forms, schedules, or lines will be added to 
calculate TPI. The IRS also publishes examination statistics for 
returns classified by TPI as part of the annual Data Book. The IRS 
switched from adjusted gross income (AGI) to TPI, which is the sum of 
all positive income values appearing on a return with losses treated as 
zero, to ensure that high income return filers were not able to use 
losses to reduce AGI and appear as low income return filers for 
examination selection purposes.

    The IRS is committed to ensuring that none of the funds provided by 
the IRA will be used to increase audit rates for small businesses and 
households making less than $400,000 annually, relative to historical 
levels. Instead, the IRS's compliance efforts will focus on complex 
issues and high-dollar noncompliance. This is important, because over 
the past several years, the IRS ability to enforce the tax laws against 
noncompliant taxpayers with complex returns--including large 
corporations, complex partnerships, and high-wealth individuals--has 
been hampered by a lack of resources. The IRS been unable to audit a 
reasonable percentage of these groups and is often limited in the 
issues reviewed among those it does audit. Many of these taxpayers can 
afford to spend large amounts to drag out proceedings unnecessarily or 
bury the government in paper, leaving us unable to assure a reasonable 
degree of compliance with the laws passed by Congress. The IRA 
resources will enable us to reverse those trends.

    Question. In Secretary Yellen's August 10, 2022 letter to 
Commissioner Rettig, she states, ``I direct that any additional 
resources--including any new personnel or auditors that are hired--
shall not be used to increase the share of small business or households 
below the $400,000 threshold that are audited relative to historical 
levels.''

    For purpose of Secretary Yellen's directive, how does the IRS 
define a ``small business?'' Considering many small businesses operate 
as a pass-through entity, how will separately stated items reported on 
Schedule K-1 be calculated for purposes of Total Positive Income? How 
would Total Positive Income be calculated for a small business 
operating as a C corporation, including whether the C corporation's 
Total Positive Income would be imputed to its shareholders?

    Answer. As stated above, the IRS is committed to ensuring that none 
of the funds provided by the IRA will be used to increase audit rates 
for small businesses and households making less than $400,000 annually, 
relative to historical levels. Instead, the IRS's compliance efforts 
will focus on complex issues and high-dollar noncompliance. The IRS 
only uses TPI for individual income tax returns (Form 1040).

                                 ______
                                 
              Questions Submitted by Hon. Marsha Blackburn
    Question. Last week, you reiterated the importance of ensuring that 
taxpayers under $400,000 would not see an increase in audits beyond 
historical levels.

    Can you provide detailed information on how the historical level 
will be calculated?

    Answer. The IRS is committed to ensuring that none of the funds 
provided by the Inflation Reduction Act will be used to increase audit 
rates for small businesses and households making less than $400,000 
annually, relative to historical levels. Instead, the IRS' compliance 
efforts will focus on complex issues and high-dollar noncompliance. 
This is important, because over the past decade, the IRS's ability to 
enforce the tax laws against non-compliant taxpayers with complex 
returns--including large corporations, complex partnerships, and high-
wealth individuals--has been hampered by a lack of resources. The IRS 
has been unable to audit a reasonable percentage of these groups and is 
often limited in the issues reviewed among those it does audit. Many of 
these taxpayers can afford to spend large amounts to drag out 
proceedings unnecessarily or bury the government in paper, leaving us 
unable to assure a reasonable degree of compliance with the laws passed 
by Congress. The IRA resources will enable us to reverse those trends.

    Question. Can you provide detailed information on how total 
positive income will be calculated and how the IRS determined that 
total positive income should be used compared to adjusted gross income?

    Answer. Since 1981, the IRS has used Total Positive Income (TPI) as 
a method to group individual tax returns (Form 1040). The IRS switched 
from adjusted gross income (AGI) to TPI, which is the sum of all 
positive income values appearing on a return with losses treated as 
zero, to ensure that high income return filers were not able to use 
losses to reduce AGI and appear as low income return filers for 
examination selection purposes. The IRS currently publishes examination 
statistics for returns classified by TPI as part of the annual Data 
Book.

    Question. Can you provide a numerical breakdown of which IRS 
employees are considered essential versus nonessential at the beginning 
of the pandemic as compared to now?

    Answer. ``Essential'' and ``nonessential'' describe functions and 
personnel associated with sustaining continuity of operations during a 
catastrophic event, which would otherwise severely impact operations. 
Department of Homeland Security Federal Continuity Directive 1 requires 
all Federal agencies to identify essential functions and implement 
safeguards to ensure that an agency's mission is accomplished with 
minimal or no interruption in any threat environment. Federal 
Continuity Directive 2 further categorizes essential functions into 
Mission Essential Functions (MEF) or Essential Supporting Activities 
(ESA). MEFs are essential functions directly related to accomplishing 
an agency's mission, as set forth in its statutory or executive 
charter. ESAs are functions that support performance of MEFs. ESAs are 
important facilitating activities performed by most organizations (for 
example, providing a secure workplace, or ensuring computer systems are 
operating).

    The IRS has three MEFs--processing remittances, processing tax 
returns, and processing refunds; the IRS has nine ESAs--physical 
security, facilities, information technologies, legal advice/counsel, 
finance, procurement, communication, payroll, and workforce relations. 
IRS MEFs and ESAs remained the same before, during, and after the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

    During the COVID-19 pandemic, the IRS instituted previously 
developed protocols from our ``Infectious Disease in the Workplace'' 
plan, along with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and 
other Federal entities. By applying the protocols, the IRS was able to 
ensure employee safety while maintaining business operations.

    Question. Last year through the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRS 
received $80 billion in taxpayer dollars. Now, the IRS has requested 
taxpayer dollars from Congress to make up for apparent insufficient 
Inflation Reduction Act funding for taxpayer services and IT 
modernization, culminating in budget increases in all four budgetary 
accounts.

    The IRS recently released its strategic operating plan for the 
Inflation Reduction Act Funding, and it was devoid of specifics on how 
the resources would be spent.

    Do you commit to providing a complete, transparent, and detailed 
account to this committee of how this money will be spent and what the 
initiatives will cost within 3 months?

    Answer. The IRS is committed to being transparent about how it 
plans to use the funds provided in the IRA. We will share staffing 
information as we move forward, and more detailed technology spending 
in advance of major technology investments. We're refining initiative 
cost estimates and anticipate sharing additional details as they are 
available. Our annual budget submission in FY 2024 provided IRA 
spending and staffing information by account and activity; we will 
continue to include that data going forward.

    Question. There continue to be significant delays in processing the 
Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC), with the IRS site stating that 
the 941-X backlog is 929,000 as of April 5th, up from 135,000 in August 
of 2022. This delay is causing significant financial hardship for small 
businesses waiting for their refund for up to 2 years. Some have had to 
shut down their businesses, and many that are still operating have had 
to lay off employees, take high-interest loans, or even mortgage 
personal residences.

    What steps do you intend to take to resolve the ERTC backlog? And 
specifically, that for aggregate filers?

    Answer. The IRS has received approximately 3.6 million ERTC claims 
over the course of the program. While we experienced a backlog in 
processing these claims earlier this year, the IRS has cleared the 
backlog. Our current inventory is over 600,000, virtually all of which 
was received within the last 90 days.

    Since enactment, the IRS has taken steps to modify how we process 
the claims to provide better service to businesses, but we've faced 
challenges in ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the credits. These 
challenges stem from the ERTC's complicated eligibility requirements, 
limited data availability, resources to process claims and balance 
phone demand, limited enforcement resources, and the aggressive 
promotion of ERTC schemes.

    As we worked to get current with our inventory this summer, we 
noticed a fundamental change taking place with a growing amount of 
aggressive marketing touting misleading information about the 
requirements and documentation necessary to qualify for the credit. 
This is adding risk for businesses improperly claiming the credit at 
the advice of these promoters. They are scamming many small businesses 
who fall victim to the aggressive marketing. To protect honest small 
business owners from scams, the IRS announced an immediate moratorium 
starting on September 14, 2023 through at least the end of the year on 
processing new ERTC claims. The moratorium will help protect taxpayers 
by adding a new safety net onto this program to focus on fraudulent 
claims and scammers taking advantage of honest taxpayers.

    During the moratorium, the IRS will continue to work ERTC claims 
filed prior to September 14, 2023. However, because of increased fraud 
concerns, we're undertaking stricter compliance reviews for these 
claims. That means that the processing times for them will be longer, 
increasing from 90 days to 180 days and perhaps longer if a claim faces 
further review or audit. We may also seek additional documentation from 
taxpayers to ensure their claims are legitimate. Payouts for these 
claims will continue during the moratorium period but at a slower pace 
due to the detailed compliance reviews. The detailed compliance reviews 
will include audit work and criminal investigations on promoters and 
businesses filing dubious claims. These enhanced compliance reviews of 
existing claims submitted before the moratorium are critical to protect 
against fraud but also to protect businesses from facing penalties or 
interest payments stemming from bad claims pushed by promoters.

    The IRS is developing new initiatives to help businesses who found 
themselves victims of aggressive promoters. The first is to provide 
businesses an opportunity to withdraw current claims. Tax professionals 
report they have businesses ready to come in after realizing they had 
been lured into claiming the credit. This option will allow the 
taxpayers, many of them small businesses who were misled by promoters, 
to avoid possible repayment issues and paying promoters contingency 
fees. Filers of these more than 600,000 claims awaiting processing will 
have this option available. In addition, we also are exploring a 
voluntary disclosure program for repayments for those who received an 
improper ERTC payment.

               Questions Submitted by Hon. Sherrod Brown
    Question. The backlog of Form 941-X has grown from 500,000 to 
929,000. Please outline what steps you are currently taking to reduce 
this backlog. How many IRS employees and/or contract employees are 
currently working on processing the backlog of 941-X forms? 
Approximately how many forms are they processing a day? When do you

report they have businesses ready to come in after realizing they had 
been lured into claiming the credit. This option will allow the 
taxpayers, many of them small businesses who were misled by promoters, 
to avoid possible repayment issues and paying promoters contingency 
fees. Filers of these more than 600,000 claims awaiting processing will 
have this option available. In addition, we also are exploring a 
voluntary disclosure program for repayments for those who received an 
improper ERTC payment.

    Question. Will you commit to have your staff engage with the 
historic preservation community to address concerns with respect to the 
conservation easement safe harbor? Will you consider whether the safe 
harbor should provide additional clarity to historic building owners 
that account for the differences between deeds conveying easement 
rights over open space and those protecting certified historic 
structures?

    Answer. Section 605(d) of the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 (the Act) 
directed the IRS to issue safe harbor language for extinguishment 
clauses and boundary line adjustments within 120 days of enactment. 
Section 605(d)(2) of the Act gives taxpayers a 90-day period to amend 
an easement deed to substitute the safe harbor language for the 
corresponding language in the original easement deed. The 90-day period 
began on April 24, 2023, when the IRS published Notice 2023-30, and 
ended on July 24, 2023. Nothing in section 605(d) of the Act authorizes 
the IRS to supplement or amend the safe harbor guidance within the 90-
day window; therefore, the IRS doesn't have current plans to supplement 
or amend Notice 2023-30.

    The legislation excluded certain taxpayers from using the safe 
harbor, including taxpayers with contributions that were part of a 
reportable transaction, taxpayers engaged in transactions described in 
Notice 2017-10, and taxpayers with cases concerning disallowance of the 
related deduction that are docketed in Federal court. The safe harbor 
language, if used, will enable eligible taxpayers to qualify for 
retroactive relief under section 605(d)(2)(A)(ii). The IRS is committed 
to continuing to administer the Internal Revenue Code in a way that 
encourages preservation of historic buildings and open space while 
curbing the abuses that have overshadowed the true purpose of the law.

    Question. What specific lessons has the IRS learned from the Fall 
2022 outreach effort to potential EITC filers? What steps will IRS take 
to build on this effort moving forward?

    Answer. Our outreach efforts have demonstrated that we need to 
develop tailored, easy-to-understand communications based on a 
taxpayer's unique circumstances to educate, minimize burden, and use 
multiple communication formats, including texts and email.

    The IRS will take a comprehensive approach to help taxpayers claim 
any incentives for which they are eligible. We will use appropriate 
channels to alert taxpayers of potential credits and deductions that 
they may qualify for but did not claim on their return. For example, we 
will redesign and digitalize notices and ensure that notices written in 
other languages are as simple and accessible as plain-English 
documents. We will build two-way communication channels so that 
taxpayers can respond to notices online.

    The IRS pursues a variety of efforts to ensure those taxpayers 
eligible for refundable credits can receive them with minimal burden. 
We leverage internal and external stakeholders in carrying out a robust 
outreach and education program to reach the approximately 4.3 million 
non-claimants. EITC Awareness Day, for example, is an annual collection 
of local events across the country where the IRS invites community 
organizations, elected officials, State and local governments, and 
other entities throughout the Nation to raise awareness of EITC 
publications and online tools. We also collaborate with members of the 
private, public, and nonprofit sectors by hosting the Refundable Credit 
Summit, an annual gathering where IRS executives share current 
modernization efforts and updates to IRS forms and publications. The 
IRS's Stakeholder Partnership, Education, and Communication 
organization leads outreach activities at the summit. The summit also 
includes breakout sessions of the Refundable Credits Participation and 
Software Development Working groups to strategize future awareness and 
compliance approaches. We further engage with the public by 
collaborating with State and local municipalities and presenting 
information at the National Tax Forums, as well as conferences such as 
the Latino Tax Festival. Partnering with information technology and our 
online services organization, we have created tools and content on 
IRS.gov dedicated to EITC such as EITC Central (https://
www.eitc.irs.gov/) and the EITC Assistant (https://www.irs.gov/credits-
deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/use-the-eitc-
assistant).

    The IRS continues to engage with taxpayers, including small 
business taxpayers, in underserved rural and urban communities to 
deliver education and technical tools that directly address issues or 
opportunities identified on filed returns. Through our Volunteer Income 
Tax Assistance (VITA)/Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) programs, we 
will continue to strategically target populations eligible for the 
EITC. We continue to share communications focused on refundable credits 
including the EITC with VITA/TCE partners. We've asked our VITA/TCE 
partners to share this information directly with their clients, post 
information on their web pages and social media, etc. During 2022, in 
addition to eligible taxpayers who have a filing requirement, the IRS 
educated individuals that may not have a filing requirement on how to 
claim the EITC. The IRS conducted a series of targeted outreach events 
to individuals raising children who lost both parents, foster parents, 
and those living in domestic abuse centers or homeless shelters. With 
our community partners, we accomplished this outreach by identifying 
and sharing information with individuals, agencies and organizations 
that actively serve these populations. During fiscal year 2023, we've 
expanded our outreach activities to rural communities, persons with 
disabilities, and Native American/Hawaiian and Pacific Islander/Alaskan 
communities. We realize the importance and the need to inform as many 
taxpayers as possible about the EITC, as 1 out of every 5 eligible 
taxpayers do not claim the credit. The IRS will continue to 
strategically target underserved populations through its VITA/TCE 
partners and/or direct contact with agencies and organizations to 
educate individuals and families on how to claim the EITC.

    We will continue to engage with Federal agencies whose programs 
(Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for 
Needy Families, Federal Student Aid, etc.) can provide information on 
life changes that could impact refundable credit eligibility The 
interactions taxpayers have with those programs and data collected by 
the administering agency will inform the IRS on projects to improve the 
administration of refundable credits, such as creating proactive alerts 
as referenced in the IRS Strategic Operating Plan (SOP) Initiative 1.8 
and helping taxpayers accurately claim credits that they are eligible 
for as referenced in IRS SOP Initiative 1.9.

    Question. In February, Chairman Wyden and I released Left in the 
Dark, an investigative report that tells the story of older adults and 
people with disabilities living in long-term care facilities affected 
by extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent due to 
climate change.\1\ The investigation examined the 2021 Texas winter 
blackout, which resulted in half the State's 1,200 federally certified 
nursing homes reporting emergency incidents such as power loss, water 
loss, or evacuations. The Texas Long-Term Care Ombudsman described the 
blackout as the worst disaster she has experienced in her 15-year 
career.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://www.aging.senate.gov/press-releases/casey-wyden-
examine-long-term-care-shortfalls-during-texas-winter-blackout.

    However, the Texas blackout is just one example of larger, more 
frequent, and longer-lasting power outages caused by the growing 
incidence of extreme weather. The report identified hurricanes, 
wildfires, tornadoes, floods, and other extreme weather events since 
2018 that resulted in evacuations, building damage, resident injuries, 
and deaths at nursing homes and assisted living facilities in at least 
17 States. One such event occurred in December 2022, when a blackout 
cut power to 1.5 million people, including people living in my home 
State of Pennsylvania.\2\ Despite more frequent power outages, Federal 
regulations do not require nursing homes to have backup power in case 
electricity goes out. Most States also do not require assisted living 
facilities to maintain backup power.

    The report recommended that renewable energy be incorporated into 
emergency preparedness plans, particularly as the costs of renewable 
energy and energy storage continue to decline (see Recommendation 6, 
``Incorporate Renewable Energy into Emergency Preparedness,'' at 54). 
The report called on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to 
work with the Internal Revenue Service to offer guidance that educates 
nursing homes about the availability of Federal tax credits, that 
further reduce clean energy installation costs because of provisions in

the Inflation Reduction Act, and other programs.

    Question. Will you work with me and Chairman Wyden to see this 
recommendation through this year?

    Answer. We welcome the opportunity to work with you and Chairman 
Wyden, as well as with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 
to educate nursing homes on the available Federal tax credits reducing 
clean energy installation costs. We will work with our colleagues in 
the Department of Treasury to coordinate with CMS and determine what 
guidance would be helpful.

                Questions Submitted by Hon. Bill Cassidy
    Question. Federal historic preservation programs are extremely 
important to Louisiana, and specifically to urban cities like New 
Orleans that have an abundance of at-risk historic buildings. Last 
year, other members of the Senate Finance Committee and I crafted and 
included reforms to protect historic preservation conservation 
easements in reforms others were pushing as part of SECURE 2.0, which 
moved in the omnibus that passed at the end of session. Our goal was to 
ensure that the historic preservation community in Louisiana and 
elsewhere across the country can utilize historic preservation 
easements to protect and rehabilitate historic buildings in our urban 
centers. We also directed the IRS to issue a safe harbor to clear up 
some of the most litigated issues surrounding conservation easements, 
related to the extinguishment clause.

    On April 10, 2023, Treasury and the IRS issued safe harbor deed 
language for extinguishment clauses. Unfortunately, this language is 
deficient in a number of ways, including: (1) it will do nothing to 
clear the backlog of 1,200+ cases that I understand are headed to Tax 
Court relating to conservation easements, many of which include 
controversy related to the extinguishment clause; (2) the safe harbor 
language essentially restates a number of IRS positions that were 
already deemed invalid; and (3) most concerningly, the safe harbor does 
not account for new exceptions included in our conservation easement 
reform law that treat historic preservation conservation easements 
differently, and issues generic language that doesn't account for 
inherent differences between deeds on historic buildings and those on 
open space land.

    Will you please consider amending the safe harbor language to 
specifically addresses the unique characteristics of historic buildings 
in urban neighborhoods?

    Answer. Section 605(d) of the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 (the Act) 
directed the IRS to issue safe harbor language for extinguishment 
clauses and boundary line adjustments within 120 days of enactment. 
Section 605(d)(2) of the Act gives taxpayers a 90-day period to amend 
an easement deed to substitute the safe harbor language for the 
corresponding language in the original easement deed. The 90-day period 
began on April 24, 2023, when the IRS published Notice 2023-30, and 
ended on July 24, 2023. Nothing in section 605(d) of the Act authorizes 
the IRS to supplement or amend the safe harbor guidance within the 90-
day window; therefore, the IRS doesn't have current plans to supplement 
or amend Notice 2023-30.

    The legislation excluded certain taxpayers from using the safe 
harbor, including taxpayers with contributions that were part of a 
reportable transaction, taxpayers engaged in transactions described in 
Notice 2017-10, and taxpayers with cases concerning disallowance of the 
related deduction that are docketed in Federal court. The safe harbor 
language, if used, will enable eligible taxpayers to qualify for 
retroactive relief under section 605(d)(2)(A)(ii). The IRS is committed 
to continuing to administer the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) in a way 
that encourages preservation of historic buildings and open space while 
curbing the abuses that have overshadowed the true purpose of the law.

    Question. Will you engage with taxpayers, historic building owners, 
non-profits, and stakeholders from across the historic preservation 
community who utilize this tool to save historic buildings to ensure 
that safe harbor language provides clear guidance?

    Answer. The IRS issued the safe harbor notice within 120 days as 
required by law. Taxpayers who are not excepted by the legislation may 
amend their deeds to include the safe harbor language for boundary line 
and extinguishment clauses. We look forward to working with the 
historic preservation community to raise awareness about these 
distinctions and to help develop our efforts toward future potential 
guidance. The IRS will work with taxpayers, historic building owners, 
non-profits, and other stakeholders who use the safe harbor provisions 
in Notice 2023-30 to preserve historic buildings as well as those who 
preserve open space.

    Question. Will you ensure that such guidance accounts for State-law 
property rights and that events after the original donation may have 
created or transferred property rights to individuals or entities other 
than the original donor and donee?

    Answer. Yes, we will be mindful of property rights, which are 
governed by State law, as we consider additional IRC section 170 
guidance. Through the normal guidance process, the IRS will work with 
stakeholders in this area to ensure taxpayers have clear guidance 
regarding the opportunity for the deduction under IRC section 170(h) 
for contributions that meet the IRC requirements.

    Question. Will you ask your team to ensure that historic 
preservation easements, operating as Congress intended, are not 
inadvertently being captured in broader conservation easement 
enforcement campaigns?

    Answer. The IRS has taken necessary steps to ensure that taxpayers 
who donate conservation easements that satisfy the IRC requirements and 
applicable Treasury Regulations are not inadvertently captured in 
broader conservation easement enforcement efforts and will continue to 
do so.

    Question. Will you report back to me on these issues to ensure that 
historic preservationists are not being deterred from using this 
important tool to protect historic buildings?

    Answer. As stated previously, the IRS is committed to continuing to 
administer the IRC in a way that encourages preservation of historic 
buildings and open space while curbing the abuse that has overshadowed 
the true purpose of the law. The IRS will address any future inquiries 
you may have on this topic.

    Question. On September 9th of last year, I sent Former Commissioner 
Rettig and Secretary Yellen a letter and have yet to receive a 
response. The body of the letter was as follows:

_______________________________________________________________________

Dear Secretary Yellen and Commissioner Rettig,

    Last year Louisiana was devastated by Hurricane Ida, on top of 
major storms in 2020. As a consequence, millions of Louisiana residents 
were left without electricity for days, and in some cases weeks. Today, 
the State of Louisiana remains committed to repairing and upgrading its 
critical infrastructure, such as electric transmission and distribution 
systems, that the people of our State rely on for their own health, 
safety, and productivity.

    To facilitate this commitment, the State of Louisiana recently 
enacted legislation that will decrease borrowing costs to our utilities 
which will lessen the financial burden on Louisiana ratepayers of 
necessary infrastructure repairs and upgrades. Other States have passed 
similar laws. When a major storm or natural disaster hits, whether it 
is a hurricane, wildfire, or devastating winter storm, utilities are 
required to take prompt action to remediate damage as quickly as 
possible. Typically, utilities will recover the costs of the repairs 
from ratepayers over time through regulator-approved surcharges. The 
legislation passed in Louisiana would allow utilities to raise required 
funds through an instrumentality of the State by securitizing these 
surcharges. This type of arrangement will benefit ratepayers by 
reducing the overall borrowing costs for the utility.

    For over 15 years, guidance from the IRS has facilitated the 
ability of utilities to finance certain costs that can be recovered 
from ratepayers over time through a special purpose financing entity 
owned by the utility. However, such guidance would not apply to a 
special purpose vehicle owned by the State of Louisiana. As such, we 
write to respectfully request that you consider broadening existing IRS 
guidance to cover State owned special purpose vehicles. Doing so would 
have the same tax consequences to utilities as the existing IRS 
guidance, while enhancing the benefits to ratepayers through lower 
borrowing costs.

    We sincerely appreciate your consideration of this matter. Thank 
you in advance for any assistance you are able to provide.

_______________________________________________________________________

    Will you please respond to this letter as soon as possible?

    Answer. We provided a response to you and Senator Kennedy on July 
21, 2023. We apologize for the delay. We understand the importance of 
considering guidance that expands the ability of utilities to finance 
repair and upgrade costs through State-owned special purpose vehicles. 
We are actively considering how to proceed on this important issue.

                                 ______
                                 
                Questions Submitted by Hon. John Cornyn
    Question. In October 2022, the Internal Revenue Service released 
tax gap estimates for tax years 2014 through 2016. The gross tax gap is 
the difference between what the IRS believes is the ``true'' tax 
liability for a given period and the amount of tax paid on time by 
taxpayers. What percentage of the tax gap is not collectible?

    Answer. The gross tax gap is the amount of true tax liability that 
is not paid voluntarily and timely. The net tax gap is the gross tax 
gap less tax that subsequently will be paid, either voluntarily but 
late, or collected through IRS administrative and enforcement 
activities. The net tax gap, which reflects the enforcement and other 
resources available at a particular point in time, is the portion of 
the gross tax gap that will never be paid. Changes in the level of 
enforcement and other resources available will change the relative size 
of the gross and net tax gap.

    The estimated annual gross tax gap for Tax Years (TYs) 2014 through 
2016 is $496 billion. An estimated $68 billion of the gross tax gap 
eventually will be paid, resulting in an annual net tax gap for TYs 
2014 through 2016 of $428 billion. The Net Compliance Rate (NCR) is 
defined as the sum of ``tax paid voluntarily and timely'' and 
``enforced and other late payments,'' divided by ``total true tax,'' 
expressed as a percentage. The estimated NCR is 87 percent.

    The October 2022 release of the tax gap estimates includes tax gap 
projections for the TYs 2017 through 2019. The projected annual gross 
tax gap for TYs 2017 through 2019 is $540 billion. An estimated annual 
$70 billion of the gross tax gap is expected to be paid eventually 
resulting in an annual net tax gap of $470 billion. The NCR projection 
is 87 percent.

    Question. Please provide a breakdown of the tax gap by income. 
Specifically, what percentage of the tax gap is attributable to 
households making less than $50,000; $100,000; $250,000; $400,000; 
$1,000,000 and over $1,000,000? Please also include a breakdown by 
income--for the numbers of taxpayers/households contributing to the tax 
gap for each group and the dollars for each group.

    Answer. Although the IRS does not currently have an approach for 
estimating the overall tax gap by income, the IRS published a working 
paper that includes 2011 to 2013 estimates of selected components of 
the tax gap--the individual income tax and self-employment tax 
underreporting tax.\3\ Of note, our best estimate of the distribution 
of the tax gap for 2011 to 2013 associated with underreporting by 
individuals with $500,000 of income, including self-employment taxes, 
is nearly $41 billion per year. This would be higher if adjusted for 
inflation to 2022 dollars. In addition, we believe that the estimates 
for higher-income taxpayers may understate the actual noncompliance for 
that taxpayer segment. This is because higher-income taxpayers are more 
likely to have opaque sources of income and complex business 
arrangements. Decades of IRS research show that noncompliance is higher 
for this type of income, which is not subject to third-party reporting.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ See https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/event/12th-annual-irstpc-

analysis tables.

    Question. Please provide a breakdown of the tax gap attributable to 
sole proprietorships; pass-through entities; and C corporations--in 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
terms of percentage, numbers, and dollars.

    Answer. In Publication 5365, we break down the tax gap attributable 
to certain types of taxpayers for TYs 2014-2016, including individuals 
and large and small corporations.\4\ This summarizes the information in 
Publication 1315. Table 2 in Publication 1315 shows our current tax gap 
estimates by tax gap component.\5\ Table 5 from Publication 1315 
provides additional detail on the Individual Income Tax Underreporting 
tax gap by source of income, including proprietorship income and other 
pass-through income. Because compliance data is lacking, the IRS does 
not currently have an approach for breaking down the tax gap 
attributable to partnerships versus sole proprietorships. Also, due to 
the complex nature of partnerships and the difficulty in uncovering 
noncompliance associated with these entities, we believe the true tax 
gap associated with partnership income may be larger than what we are 
currently able to capture.

\2\ Less than 0.5 percent.
\3\ Less than $0.5 billion.
\4\ The Other Taxes component includes the Alternative Minimum Tax,
  Excess APTC Repayment, and taxes reported in the ``Other Taxes''
  section of the Form 1040 except for self-employment tax and unreported
  Social Security and Medicare tax (which are included in the employment
  tax gap estimates).
\5\ The Unallocated Marginal Effects component reflects the difference
  between (1) the estimate of the individual income tax underreporting
  tax gap where underreported tax is calculated based on all
  misreporting combined and (2) the estimate of the individual income
  tax underreporting tax gap based on the sum of the tax gaps associated
  with each line item where the line item tax gap is calculated based on
  the misreporting of that item only. There may be a difference whenever
  more than one line item has been misreported on the same return and
  the combined misreporting results in a higher marginal tax rate than
  when the tax on the misreported amounts is calculated separately.
Detail may not add to total due to rounding.

    Question. For every dollar initially assessed against taxpayers, 
what percentage is collected by the IRS?

    Answer. The IRS collects 76 percent of every dollar initially 
assessed post-filing against taxpayers. Results are based on 
assessments made between Fiscal Years 2010 and 2020 and collected by 
February 2023.

    Question. What is the current ``no-change'' audit rate? Please 
break it down by type of audit (that is, mail/correspondence, office, 
field, National Research Program).

    Answer. The Internal Revenue Service Data Book, 2022, released on 
April 14, 2023,\6\ provides no-change rates by type and size of return 
for TYs 2012 through 2020.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ See Table 17, available at https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-
tax-stats-irs-data-book.

    Question. During your confirmation hearing in February 2023, I 
raised the issue of Notice 2016-66, which identifies micro-captives as 
a ``transaction of interest,'' and the ``one-size-fits-all'' approach 
that the IRS appears to have taken in this area. This approach 
reportedly forced many taxpayers to settle due to the high cost of 
litigation and effectively eliminated the opportunity to have a hearing 
in the Independent Office of Appeals, resulting in a backlog in the 
courts. As you know, the Taxpayer First Act (Pub. L. 116-25) provides 
taxpayers with an Appeals hearing on the merits of their case. I have 
also authored legislation called the Small Business Taxpayer Bill of 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rights that, among other things, would improve the Appeals process.

    Last year, a Federal district court vacated Notice 2016-66 on two 
grounds: (1) the IRS did not comply with the Administrative Procedure 
Act's (APA) notice and public comment requirements and (2) the agency 
acted arbitrarily and capriciously in issuing the notice. On April 10, 
2023, the IRS decided to start the process over by issuing notice of a 
new proposed rulemaking relating to micro-captives and asking for 
public comment on the proposed regulation. Upon examination, it appears 
that the proposed notice fails to include a supporting record of facts 
and data that would support IRS claims that micro-captives have the 
potential for tax avoidance or evasion.

    Does the IRS intend to follow the requirements of the APA, which 
requires that an agency examine relevant data and articulate a 
satisfactory explanation for a rulemaking, should the new proposed rule 
move forward?

    Answer. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the IRS will 
follow the requirements of the APA in promulgating any rule finalizing 
the current proposed rule relating to micro-captive transactions. 
Treasury and the IRS are committed to a tax regulatory process that 
encourages public participation, fosters transparency, affords fair 
notice, and ensures adherence to the rule of law. We will carefully 
consider public feedback on the proposal before issuing any final rule.

    Question. In addition, please provide the following:

    b.  The total approximate dollar amount of aggregate assessments 
asserted against taxpayers in section 831(b) related cases that are 
currently pending in the U.S. Tax Court.

    Answer. The total approximate dollar amount of deficiencies and 
penalties asserted against taxpayers in IRC section 831(b) cases 
pending in the U.S. Tax Court is $661,268,170.51.

    c.  The number of Tax Court cases referenced immediately above 
where the judgment or settlement amount represented 10 percent or less 
of the deficiency or assessment, including penalties and interest, 
asserted against the plaintiffs.

    Answer. The cases in which a judgment has been entered or a 
settlement has been reached are no longer docketed. As a result, there 
are no cases responsive to this request. The following paragraphs 
discuss previously docketed cases in which there was a judgment or 
settlement.

    Generally, each examination related to an entity that has elected 
to be treated as a IRC section 831(b) insurance company (the ``section 
831(b) company'') that results in cases docketed in the Tax Court 
involves a ``family'' of related cases. These related cases may 
include: each entity that claimed deductions for amounts characterized 
as premiums paid to the section 831(b) company (the ``insured entity'') 
if that entity is a C corporation; the partners or shareholders of each 
insured entity that is a partnership or S corporation for Federal 
income tax purposes; the section 831(b) company; and the owners of the 
section 831(b) company.

    There were no previously docketed Tax Court cases resolved by 
judgments in which the judgment amount represented 10 percent or less 
of the deficiency. In fact, as discussed in the response to question 
(d) below, the judgments in each of the IRC section 831(b) cases 
represented 100 percent of the portion of the deficiency attributable 
to the disallowance of the claimed deductions for payments to the 
section 831(b) company and 80 percent or more of the deficiency 
attributable to the claimed deductions for payments to the section 
831(b) company including penalties.

    Since January 2020, the IRS Office of Chief Counsel (``Counsel'') 
has offered to settle certain docketed cases pursuant to the terms of a 
settlement initiative. The settlement initiative resolves both docketed 
tax years and all non-docketed tax years involving the section 831(b) 
company for which the statute of limitations is open (``open years'').

    For example, because the terms of the settlement initiative 
characterize the section 831(b) company income as income to the owners 
of the section 831(b) company on liquidation (or deemed liquidation) of 
the section 831(b) company in a year that is generally not docketed, 
the settlement of the docketed case with respect to the section 831(b) 
company generally reflects no deficiency for the years docketed.

    Counsel has settled a small number of families of docketed cases 
for 10 percent or less of the deficiency. These settlements do not 
reflect a conclusion by Counsel that the adjustments were incorrect, 
but instead result from decisions in the interest of sound tax 
administration to preserve scarce examination and litigation resources 
for other cases.

    In certain circumstances, Counsel has settled for 10 percent or 
less of the deficiency in one or more cases within a family of cases. 
These settlements include:

          Cases in which substantial unrelated adjustments were 
        conceded.

          Cases asserting that the section 831(b) company was required 
        to include the amounts it received in income that have been 
        conceded on grounds unrelated to that substantive issue. The 
        adjustments to deny the deductions claimed by the taxpayers who 
        paid the premiums to these section 831(b) companies have not 
        been conceded, and litigation continues with respect to those 
        taxpayers.

          Cases in which the taxpayer received credit for additional 
        taxes paid during the course of the controversy or was allowed 
        a net operating loss carryback that reduced or eliminated the 
        deficiency.

    Some of the previously docketed cases were within the jurisdiction 
of and were resolved by the Independent Office of Appeals 
(``Appeals''), rather than as part of the Counsel settlements. In 
general, Appeals has consistently held that taxpayers claiming 
deductions in these transactions face significant litigating hazards. 
Accordingly, to the best of our knowledge, all Appeals settlements as 
to deductions by the insured entity have been government-favorable.

    Considering all of these circumstances, we do not believe the 
number of previously docketed Tax Court cases in which the settlement 
amount represented 10 percent or less of the deficiency, including 
penalties and interest, asserted against the Tax Court petitioners is 
meaningful. We have, however, determined the number of previously 
docketed Tax Court cases in which the settlement amount represented 10 
percent or less of the deficiency, including penalties, but excluding 
interest, which continues to accrue until the liability is paid in 
full. The total number of previously docketed Tax Court cases resolved 
through settlement is 546. In 150 of these cases, the settlement amount 
represented 10 percent or less of the deficiency, including penalties.

    d.  The number of Tax Court cases referenced immediately above 
where the judgment or settlement amount represented 90 percent or more 
of the deficiency or assessment, including penalties and interest, 
asserted against the plaintiffs.

    Answer. There are no cases responsive to question (d) because cases 
in which a judgment has been entered or a settlement has been reached 
are no longer docketed. However, in each of the IRC section 831(b) 
cases decided on the merits, the Tax Court held that the transactions 
at issue did not meet the requirements for treatment as insurance for 
Federal income tax purposes and denied the claimed deductions. In one 
of these cases, the court imposed penalties and in another of these 
cases, the court required the electing entity to include the alleged 
premiums in income.\7\ The judgments in each of the IRC section 831(b) 
cases represented 100 percent of the portion of the deficiency 
attributable to the disallowance of the claimed deductions for payments 
to the section 831(b) company and 80 percent or more of the deficiency 
attributable to the claimed deductions for payments to the section 
831(b) company including penalties.

    Question. To be eligible for the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit 
(section 30D), what critical mineral and battery sourcing requirements 
must be met?

    Answer. IRC section 30D(e)(1)(A) provides that the Critical 
Minerals Requirement with respect to the battery from which the 
electric motor of a vehicle draws electricity is satisfied if the 
percentage of the value of the applicable critical minerals (as defined 
in IRC section 45X(c)(6)) contained in such battery that were (i) 
extracted or processed in the United States, or in any country with 
which the United States has a free trade agreement in effect, or (ii) 
recycled in North America, is equal to or greater than the applicable 
percentage (as certified by the qualified manufacturer, in such form or 
manner as prescribed by the Secretary). The applicable percentage for 
the Critical Minerals Requirement is set forth in IRC section 
30D(e)(1)(B)(i) through (v) and varies based on when the vehicle is 
placed in service. In the case of a vehicle placed in service after the 
date of issuance of the proposed guidance described in IRC section 
30D(e)(3)(B) and before January 1, 2024, the applicable percentage is 
40 percent. In the case of a vehicle placed in service during Calendar 
Year 2024, 2025, and 2026, the applicable percentage is 50 percent, 60 
percent, and 70 percent, respectively. In the case of a vehicle placed 
in service after December 31, 2026, the applicable percentage is 80 
percent.

    IRC section 30D(e)(2)(A) provides that the Battery Components 
Requirement with respect to the battery from which the electric motor 
of a vehicle draws electricity is satisfied if the percentage of the 
value of the components contained in such battery that were 
manufactured or assembled in North America is equal to or greater than 
the applicable percentage (as certified by the qualified manufacturer, 
in such form or manner as prescribed by the Secretary). The applicable 
percentage for the Battery Components Requirement is set forth in IRC 
section 30D(e)(2)(B)(i) through (vi) and varies based on when the 
vehicle is placed in service. In the case of a vehicle placed in 
service after the date of issuance of the proposed guidance described 
in new IRC section 30D(e)(3)(B) and before January 1, 2024, the 
applicable percentage is 50 percent. In the case of a vehicle placed in 
service during Calendar Year 2024 or 2025, the applicable percentage is 
60 percent. In the case of a vehicle placed in service during Calendar 
Year 2026, 2027, and 2028, the applicable percentage is 70 percent, 80 
percent, and 90 percent, respectively. In the case of a vehicle placed 
in service after December 31, 2028, the applicable percentage is 100 
percent.

    Treasury issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, published in the 
Federal Register on April 17, 2023. These proposed regulations have not 
been finalized; there was a 60-day window for the submission of public 
comments and a public hearing.

    Part III, The Critical Minerals and Battery Components 
Requirements, of the Background section for the proposed regulations 
provides detailed information concerning the component requirements to 
qualify for the credit. Proposed section 1.30D-3(a) proposes a three-
step process for determining the percentage of the value of the 
applicable critical minerals in a battery that contribute toward 
meeting the Critical Minerals Requirement. Proposed Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) section 1.30D-3(b) provides rules for determining 
compliance with the Battery Components Requirement, outlining a four-
step process for determining the percentage of the value of the battery 
components in a battery that contribute toward meeting the Battery 
Components Requirement. We will carefully consider public comments 
before issuing final rules.

    Question. To be eligible for the (i) $4,000 tax credit for used 
electric vehicles (section 25E); (ii) the $40,000 tax credit for 
commercial electric vehicles (section 45W) and; or (iii) the tax credit 
for fuel cell vehicles, what critical mineral and battery souring 
requirements must be met?

    Answer. IRC section 30D(e) sets forth the critical mineral and 
battery component requirements. In contrast, neither IRC Sections 25E 
nor 45W provide any critical mineral nor battery component sourcing 
requirements in their respective IRC sections. Similarly, although IRC 
Sections 25E and 45W cross-reference specific subsections of IRC 
section 30D, neither IRC section 25E nor 45W cross-reference IRC 
section 30D(e) to incorporate those requirements into their respective 
code sections. Consequently, neither IRC section 25E nor section 45W 
provide any requirements regarding critical minerals or battery 
component requirements.

    Question. I wish to bring to your attention a tax issue that is 
critically important to public school systems across Texas. The Texas 
Permanent School Fund (PSF) is a multibillion-dollar public endowment 
belonging to the State of Texas. Since its inception in 1845, the PSF 
has evolved to support public education in two very important ways: (1) 
it provides direct funding to help pay for the cost of public and 
charter school education that is backed by physical assets owned by the 
State of Texas; and (2) it serves as a financial backstop to the bond 
issues underwritten by individual school and charter districts across 
Texas. PSF's bond guarantee program means lower borrowing costs for 
school construction, saving Texas taxpayers millions annually.

    Unfortunately, the bond guarantee program is subject to an obsolete 
IRS regulation that limits its capacity based on an outdated value of 
the PSF. In fact, the IRS regulation forced the program to close 
recently, causing dozens of Texas school districts to incur either 
avoidable financing costs or delays in the construction and renovation 
of much needed educational facilities. It is important to note that 
Treasury and IRS provided the program with relief when it faced a 
similar issue in 2009.

    In 2020, the PSF began discussions with Treasury and IRS to seek 
relief once again, providing the agencies with options that would 
ensure the bond guarantee program could remain open and provide Texas 
school districts that include both public and charter schools with 
access to the lowest possible financing.

    Treasury has the authority to fix the issue again. However, despite 
over a year of attempted communication with IRS and Treasury, it 
appears that the status of the current request for relief remains 
uncertain. This is not a sustainable situation for students, parents, 
or hardworking taxpayers across Texas. A growing public and charter 
school population requires many Texas school systems to build new 
school facilities and make critically necessary updates and repairs to 
current facilities. And without the bond guarantee program, the 
borrowing costs combined with today's high inflation, will drastically 
limit the ability of school districts across Texas to meet demand.

    It is my understanding that Treasury and IRS have been in 
communication on this issue for some time now but that stakeholders 
have not received an update for more than 6 months. What is the status 
of the PSF's request for relief?

    Answer. Treasury and the IRS released Notice 2023-39 on May 10, 
2023, which addresses whether certain perpetual trust funds created and 
controlled by States, and pledged as credit enhancements to guarantee 
tax-exempt bonds, will be treated as replacement proceeds for purposes 
of the arbitrage investment restrictions.

    Briefly, the existing regulations under IRC section 148 provide an 
exception to the arbitrage investment restrictions that applies to 
certain perpetual trust funds that are created and controlled by a 
State and pledged as credit enhancement to guarantee tax-exempt bonds. 
The existing regulations limit the outstanding amount of bonds subject 
to the exception to 500 percent of the total costs of the assets held 
by the fund as of December 16, 2009. Notice 2023-39 provides that 
Treasury and the IRS intend to issue proposed regulations that would 
remove the ``as of December 16, 2009,'' limitation from the existing 
exception. In general, the guidance described in Notice 2023-39 may be 
relied upon for bonds sold on or after May 10, 2023.

                                 ______
                                 
           Questions Submitted by Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto
    Question. In response to my recent letter regarding phasing in 
changes in tip rates for Nevada workers covered by Tip Rate 
Determination Agreements, the Department of Treasury wrote in its March 
7, 2023 letter to me that ``. . . tip rates are a product of 
significant work by the IRS, employers, and tipped employees over the 
last 2\1/2\ years, which include compiling and reviewing data for each 
establishment, position, and shift. There is an administrative burden 
on both the employers and the IRS to implement tip rate changes.'' I 
appreciated at your nomination hearing that you pledged to work with me 
on this issue.

    Does this response indicate the IRS is ruling out phasing in the 
changes to tip rates?

    Answer. The IRS is committed to implementing fair, consistent, and 
accurate tip rates across the country. Our tip reporting programs--
voluntary for both the employer and employee--are data driven and have 
the flexibility to correct tip rates when employer and employee data 
shows that the amount of cash and charged tips received (or shared) by 
tipped employees is less than the established tip rate. Factors the IRS 
considers when adjusting tip rates include changes in sales, staffing, 
or employee tip-sharing policies. Because tip agreements are specific 
to each employer, venue, and employee position, tip rate reductions are 
applied on an individualized basis. In making tip rate adjustments for 
a particular establishment, the IRS welcomes and considers any data 
that shows a tip rate adjustment is needed and considers any approach 
that may fairly implement those changes. In considering any approach, 
data would need to be presented showing evidence of deficiencies in 
current tip rates. As noted above, the tip program has a current 
process in place to reduce tip rates when warranted on an 
individualized basis. The IRS is dedicated to ensuring the tax law is 
administered fairly and welcomes suggestions and comments to improve 
our voluntary compliance programs.

    Question. Currently, the IRS does not allow Individual Taxpayer 
Identification Numbers (ITINs) applications to be processed 
electronically and requires that ITIN applicants file a tax return 
along with their applications. Would the IRS consider eliminating these 
barriers for ITIN applicants?

    Answer. As part of our efforts to become fully digital and 
modernize processes to improve the taxpayer experience and 
organizational efficiency, the IRS continues to consider ways to 
streamline and improve the ITIN application process to help ensure that 
all eligible applicants receive the Federal income tax benefits for 
which they qualify. The parameters of any electronic filling and intake 
process would need to conform to the statutory requirements set forth 
in Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 6109, which provides special 
rules regarding the IRS's issuance of ITINs.

    In general, IRC section 6109 authorizes the IRS to issue an ITIN to 
an eligible individual only if the eligible individual submits an 
application that meets all requirements under that statute, as well as 
guidance published by the Secretary.\8\ IRC section 6109 describes 
documentation that an eligible individual must submit with their ITIN 
application in order for their application to be valid. Specifically, 
IRC section 6109(i)(2)(A) requires eligible individuals to submit all 
documentation that the Secretary may require that proves the 
individual's identity, foreign status, and residency. For purposes of 
making a final determination on an eligible individual's ITIN 
application, IRC section 6109(i)(2)(B) provides that the IRS may accept 
only original documents or certified copies meeting the requirements of 
the Secretary. Lastly, IRC section 6109(c) provides general authority 
to the Secretary to require such information as may be necessary for 
the IRS to assign an identifying number to any person. Based on those 
statutory rules and current Treasury Department guidance, the IRS 
currently requires a manual submission of Form W-7, Application for IRS 
Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. Once the IRS assigns an 
ITIN, individuals can file tax returns in subsequent years 
electronically using an ITIN.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ The term ``Secretary'' in IRC section 6109 refers to the 
Secretary of the Treasury, including her delegate.

    The IRS is committed to improving the ITIN application process in a 
manner that reflects Congress's continued strengthening of the ITIN 
program. Therefore, any potential application process that incorporates 
electronic processing components, and any revised intake procedures 
published by the Treasury Department and the IRS, would balance the 
benefits of improving the ability for eligible individuals to receive 
an ITIN with the IRS's responsibility to administer and enforce the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
integrity of the ITIN program.

    Question. There is currently a moratorium on new applications for 
Certified Acceptance Agents (CAA), which provide crucial service to 
immigrants so that they can verify original documents as part of their 
applications for Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs). 
When will the CAA moratorium be lifted?

    Answer. The IRS placed a moratorium on the Acceptance Agent 
Application Process on August 15, 2022, lasting until the end of 2023. 
When we lift the moratorium, we'll issue a notification of rescission. 
The moratorium allows for significant modernization efforts resulting 
in a more efficient application process. In the interim, there are 
currently over 9,000 approved Acceptance Agent locations, with 
representation in all 50 States and 51 foreign countries, that are 
available to assist individuals that need ITIN services. Additionally, 
the IRS also provides this service at local Taxpayer Assistance Centers 
(TAC). As of April 29, 2023, the local TAC offices have recorded 63,335 
document authentications so far for fiscal year 2023.

    Question. Would the IRS consider allowing Certified Acceptance 
Agents (CAA) to electronically upload copies of documents they have 
verified?

    Answer. Yes. In May 2022, the IRS made the Documentation Upload 
Tool (DUT) available to Certified Acceptance Agents (CAA). This 
provides CAAs with the ability to send documentation electronically to 
the IRS. After receiving more than 200 submissions, we paused CAA use 
of the DUT to design and implement features that will improve 
application process efficiency and the overall taxpayer experience. We 
expect to make the DUT available again to CAAs later this year.

                                 ______
                                 
               Questions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley
                           taxpayer services
    Question. The Treasury Department and Democrats have been touting 
that Inflation Reduction Act resources have enabled the IRS to achieve 
an 87-percent level of service on its taxpayer help line. However, this 
is largely because there's been 30 million fewer taxpayer calls this 
year than last, not because of a dramatic improvement in service. In 
fact, when accounting for all calls, including those answered through 
automation, 4 million fewer taxpayer calls have even been answered.

    Given the additional resources and personnel, why hasn't the IRS 
been able to answer a greater number of taxpayer calls either live or 
through automation?

    Answer. The IRS delivered dramatically improved service in filing 
season 2023. Thanks to the 5,000 new hires made possible by Inflation 
Reduction Act resources, IRS customer service representatives answered 
more than 6.5 million taxpayer calls this year, 2.4 million more calls 
with live assistance since the start of the year through April 7th, 
compared to the same period in 2022. The IRS cut phone wait times to 4 
minutes, down from 27 minutes in filing season 2022. The IRS achieved 
an 87-percent Level of Service (LOS) with live assistance this filing 
season. This is a more than fivefold increase in LOS over filing season 
2022.

    Question. Since only around $3 billion of the $80 billion provided 
to the IRS in the IRA was for taxpayer services, according to 
information shared with tax writing committees, that taxpayer services 
money will run out by FY 2026. What impact will the exhaustion of 
taxpayer services money from the IRA have on the ability of the IRS to 
answer the phone, and how much money do you recommend Congress 
reallocate from enforcement to taxpayer services to keep up levels of 
service?

    Answer. Overall, the IRS expects to need approximately $1.9 billion 
more in taxpayer services funding than Fiscal Year 2023 discretionary 
levels. For FY 2024, the IRS requested an additional $642 million in 
discretionary funding for taxpayer services. In FY 2024, the IRS is 
also apportioning $969 million in IRA taxpayer services funding. To 
deliver the LOS taxpayers expect and deserve, the IRS would need to 
make up the remaining different with an inter-appropriation transfer 
request and/or allocation of user fees. This level includes 
inflationary increases needed in FY 2024, but inflationary increases 
will be needed annually thereafter. Without sustained, long-term 
increases in taxpayer services, many taxpayers won't be able to reach a 
representative on the phone for assistance once we exhaust the IRA 
funding, which we estimate will be exhausted after FY 2025.
                     strategic plan/lack of detail
    Question. The recent IRS ``Strategic Operating Plan'' is full of 
lofty aspirations, but short on details. It falls far short of the 
detailed spending plan than would be required by the IRS Funding 
Accountability Act that Senators Thune and I introduced earlier this 
year. When can Congress expect the IRS to provide a fully detailed plan 
that includes cost estimates for individual projects and metrics for 
determining project success?

    According to plan documents ``progress updates will be provided at 
least annually.'' During your confirmation process you spoke at length 
about your dedication to transparency and openness. A single annual 
progress update with respect to several multibillion-dollar spending 
projects hardly fits that bill. Will you commit to providing progress 
updates on at least a quarterly basis?

    Answer. The Strategic Operating Plan (SOP) is comprehensive and 
will involve hundreds of projects, some short-term and some longer-
term. We are committed to transparency and want to regularly highlight 
the progress we are making. For example, we have committed to report to 
Congress quarterly on actual obligations and number of full-time 
employees, and we are posting quarterly management updates on 
IRS.gov.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ Available at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5803.pdf.

    Additionally, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration 
(TIGTA) plans to provide quarterly reporting of the IRS's use of IRA 
funding, the first report to include funds expended through June 30, 
2023, with subsequent reports issued after the end of each quarter. The 
reports will provide cumulative results along with specific 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
expenditures for the quarter being reported.

    Finally, you will also see visible improvements to tax 
administration announced regularly. In the first full year of the IRA, 
we have published results \10\ from improvements like increased levels 
of service, new online taxpayer tools, new digital forms, increased 
scanning, customer call back features, with much more to come.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    strategic plan/who is in charge?
    Question. The ``Operating Plan'' was due February 17th, but wasn't 
completed until April 5th. You of course were not confirmed as 
Commissioner until March 9th. Between your confirmation and the release 
of the plan on April 5th, how much, if any, input did you have into 
what was included in the plan?

    Answer. I was briefed about the SOP components after I was 
confirmed, and I provided feedback. While much of the SOP was developed 
prior to my confirmation, the final document represents my priorities 
and strategic vision for the agency.

    Question. Who, in your understanding, was the primary person in 
charge of making decisions related to the plan prior to your 
confirmation? What role did Secretary Yellen or other Treasury 
Official's play in writing the plan?

    Answer. Prior to my confirmation, the then-Acting Commissioner 
worked with the former Chief Transformation Officer to develop the SOP 
as part of a collaborative process with the Department of Treasury.

    Question. According to plan documents, implementation of the 
funding plan will be coordinated by a newly formed ``Transformation and 
Strategy Office.'' Will you have complete control over this new office, 
including determining who will serve as its ``Chief Officer''?

    Answer. Yes. The Chief Transformation Coordination Officer is 
responsible for spearheading improvement efforts under the SOP. The 
official ultimately reports to me.
                      history of irs cost overruns
    Question. The ``Operating Plan'' includes aspirations to replace 
the outdated Individual Master File and Business Master File, which 
still use technology architecture dating back to the 1960s. This has 
been a stated goal of the IRS for decades. After the 1998 IRS 
Restructuring Act, IRS received multiple years of funding in the hopes 
of retiring these legacy systems. However, that attempt was plagued by 
cost overruns, a lack of functionality, and to this day the legacy 
systems persist. What steps are you taking to ensure history doesn't 
repeat itself?

    Answer. We are committed to complete transparency and 
accountability in delivering for America's taxpayers with the funding 
provided. We have numerous oversight measures in place to track the 
performance and intended outcomes of our technology investments.

    By congressional directive, the U.S. Government Accountability 
Office (GAO) provides continuous oversight of IRS technology spending 
plans and delivery. In addition, the IRS submits reports on major 
information technology project activities to the Appropriations 
Committees and to GAO. The reports include detailed, plain language 
explanations of the cumulative expenditures and schedule performance to 
date, any changes in schedule, and current risks and mitigation 
strategies. The Department of the Treasury also conducts a semiannual 
review of the IRS's technology investments to ensure the cost, 
schedule, and scope of the projects' goals are transparent. This 
reporting structure provides more certainty and clarity to Congress as 
the IRS becomes a fully digital agency.

    We are already seeing the impacts from modernizing IRS technology 
within the first year of the Inflation Reduction Act, which has 
contributed to a dramatically improved 2023 filing season. These 
include:

          Expanding the availability of customer callback option to 
        cover up to 95 percent of callers seeking live assistance. The 
        main goal of the customer callback feature is to enhance the 
        taxpayer's experience by giving them more options when call 
        volumes are high.

          Making significant progress scanning and e-filing paper 
        returns as part the Paperless Processing Initiative. The IRS 
        has scanned about 849,000 forms this year, including about 
        481,400 Forms 940, 304,000 Forms 941, and 64,000 Forms 1040. 
        This is 225 times more forms than were scanned the previous 
        year.

          Providing taxpayers with the ability to respond to notices 
        online. During filing season 2023, taxpayers were able to 
        respond to 10 of the most common notices for credits, and we 
        have since provided this capability to an additional 51 notices 
        and letters received from the IRS.

          Launching an online portal to allow businesses to file Form 
        1099 series information returns electronically. These forms 
        previously needed to be submitted through the mail. Small 
        business owners often prepare their own taxes, rather than hire 
        professional preparers, and this new tool is saving thousands 
        of small business owners time and money.

          Offering new voice and chatbots to help taxpayers with a 
        wide range of issues, including securing account transcripts, 
        getting answers to questions about balances due, and getting 
        help from the Taxpayer Advocate Service. Whether people call 
        the IRS or visit online, there are new self-service options 
        available around the clock.

          Enabling a direct-deposit refund option for 1040-X amended 
        returns. These refunds were previously only available by paper 
        check, delaying taxpayers' receipt of their refunds.

    Technology modernization will also enable the IRS paperless 
processing initiative, which will eliminate up to 200 million pieces of 
paper annually, cut processing times in half, and expedite refunds by 
several weeks. By filing season 2024 taxpayers will be able to go 
paperless if they choose to do so, and by filing season 2025, the IRS 
will achieve paperless processing digitizing all paper-filed returns 
when received. In effect, this means all paper will be converted into 
digital form as soon as it arrives at the IRS.

    In 2021, we developed an Individual Master File (IMF) Retirement 
Plan that a third party independently verified and validated; the plan 
continues to guide our approach. Retiring the IMF is incredibly 
complex, and we have developed an aggressive schedule to achieve it by 
fiscal year 2028. The plan may evolve over time to maintain alignment 
with IRS priorities, strategic initiatives, and advances in technology. 
We are happy to provide these independent reviews upon request.

    Transforming core tax processing is vital to all our essential 
functions: successfully delivering the annual tax filing season, 
ensuring the health of the Nation's tax system, and supporting the 
Federal Government's financial strength. The IRS has migrated to cloud-
based technologies and embraced modern technology practices--resulting 
in major improvements to our legacy systems. However, more work 
remains. For the IMF, we will soon begin testing to ensure our 
modernized alternative operates as intended, providing accurate and 
reliable results for taxpayers and the agency.

    As noted in the SOP, we have dedicated resources to retiring 
outdated databases including the IMF and Business Master File (BMF). 
Replacing legacy databases with a modern, flexible system will ensure 
the data in the IMF and BMF is captured timely and is accurate and 
complete for both taxpayers and employees. Part of the reason the IRS 
has methodically replaced components of the IT infrastructure slowly 
over time is due to the complexity of our ecosystem. The IRS maintains 
hundreds of interrelated systems that collectively have major impacts 
on the financial workings of the Federal Government, as well as 
individuals, families, small businesses, and corporations. Changes to 
the heart of core tax processing systems have a ripple effect, 
requiring the IRS to move iteratively and carefully to avoid disrupting 
tax processing operations.
                       irs whistleblower program
    Question. According to the ``Operating Plan'' IRS intends to 
develop and implement a plan to improve the IRS Whistleblower Program. 
I appreciate that the IRS recognizes the value and benefit of the 
whistleblower program. The improvements identified include ``using 
high-value whistleblower information effectively, rewarding 
whistleblowers fairly and as soon as possible'' and ``keeping 
whistleblowers informed of their claims.'' These are all common-sense 
initiatives that the IRS ought to be doing today. When do you expect to 
implement these and other Whistleblower Program improvements?

    Answer. The IRS is developing a Whistleblower Program Improvement 
Plan. The draft plan has seven objectives:

        1.  Increase the capacity for claim submissions the IRS can act 
        on.

        2.  Use high-value whistleblower information effectively.

        3.  Reward whistleblowers fairly and as soon as possible.

        4.  Keep whistleblowers informed of the status of their claims 
        and the basis for IRS decisions on claims.

        5.  Strengthen collaboration with Whistleblower Program 
        stakeholders.

        6.  Safeguard whistleblower and taxpayer information.

        7.  Ensure that our workforce is supported with effective 
        tools, technology, training, and other resources.

    These objectives serve as the framework for the improvement plan. 
Within each of the objectives, the IRS Whistleblower Office is 
identifying initiatives to improve the Whistleblower Program. For 
example, under the first objective, initiatives include increasing 
staffing resources where needed, making it easier to file a claim by 
obtaining an on-line digital intake portal for whistleblower claims, 
and expanding digitalization. The current draft of the improvement plan 
has specific initiatives to support the seven objectives.

    We shared an early draft of the Whistleblower Program Improvement 
Plan with internal and external stakeholders so that we could receive 
feedback. At the same time, the Whistleblower Office is not waiting for 
full development of the plan before starting or continuing specific 
efforts to improve the program. For example, the Whistleblower Office 
has already made foundational changes such as revising its mission and 
vision statements. The Whistleblower Office is prioritizing 
disaggregation of claims to allow for earlier award payments to 
whistleblowers. It is working with Counsel to evaluate how the IRS can 
use Internal Revenue Code section 6103(k)(13)(A) to work more closely 
with whistleblowers. It partnered with Counsel to provide training to 
IRS attorneys and others on the value of whistleblower information in 
fraud cases. Also, it is temporarily adding staff members on detail 
assignments to help with claim processing matters until it can make 
permanent selections. In addition, the Whistleblower Office is testing 
a new digital Document Upload Tool to receive electronic documents from 
whistleblowers through a secure online portal.
               irs compliance with tigta recommendations
    Question. During a conversation with members of the Finance 
Committee held on Thursday, April 20, 2023, you commented that the IRS 
would now have the resources to comply with recommendations made by the 
Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA).

    Please list all outstanding TIGTA recommendations and note which 
recommendations had not been implemented due to a lack of funding, and 
note the timeline for their implementation.

    Please note which unimplemented TIGTA recommendations relate to 
protection of taxpayer data, information technology systems, and IRS 
use of cloud systems.

    Answer. Please see below.

    Detailed below are specific items of note for understanding the 
data provided in the ``QFR Final'' tab.

    * The data was pulled from the Joint Audit Management Enterprise 
System (JAMES), the system that is used to monitor and approve planned 
corrective actions arising from TIGTA or GAO audits. The date of this 
data pull was May 15, 2023.

    * There are a number of recommendations whose text is redacted. 
This is because the Final Report issued by TIGTA had redactions on 
those recommendations. The information provided is equivalent to what 
is provided by TIGTA on their public-facing website. Since QFRs are on 
the record and publicly available, Counsel advised us that the 
submission for Question 6 on the QFR should reflect TIGTA's Final 
Report.

    * This information was prepared by Enterprise Audit Management 
(EAM), which is part of the Office of the Chief Risk Officer.

    * The F#, R# and P# shown in columns B, C and D are the ``finding 
number,'' ``recommendation number,'' and ``planned corrective action 
(PCA) number.'' This sequence is generally referred to as the ``PCA 
number.''

    * The current number of open recommendations is low in comparison 
to other times during the year. IRS currently has 11 pending TIGTA 
Final Reports, three pending Management Responses that will be coupled 
with the Draft Report to formulate the TIGTA Final Report, and nine 
Discussion Draft Reports which are projected to become final reports 
late in FY23. The response is a snap-shot in time.
                         total positive income
    Question. During a conversation with members on the Finance 
Committee held on Thursday, April 20, 2023, when asked how the IRS 
would determine the $400,000 number that has been used as a threshold 
for whether taxpayers would face increased scrutiny from the IRS, you 
said the IRS would use Total Positive Income.

    Total Positive Income is not a concept defined in statute, but is 
referenced in the Internal Revenue Manual. The IRS Data Book says that 
``[i]n general, total positive income is the sum of all positive 
amounts shown for the various sources of income reported on an 
individual income tax return and, thus, excludes losses.''\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-irs-data-book-
glossary-of-terms.

    Will the Total Positive Income concept used to determine which 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
taxpayers fall below the $400,000 threshold disregard losses?

    Answer. Response below.

    Question. If so, why did the IRS decide to use a measure of income 
that excludes losses? Wouldn't such a measure include many small 
businesses, including sole proprietorships and family farms with 
adjusted gross income or taxable income far below $400,000?

    Answer. Response below.

    Question. In 2018, how many taxpayers would have been at or below 
the $400,000 threshold based on Total Positive Income, or adjusted 
gross income, or taxable income. Please note the number of taxpayers 
that would meet each separate threshold.

    Answer. Since 1981, the IRS has used Total Positive Income (TPI) as 
a method to group individual tax returns (Form 1040). The IRS switched 
from adjusted gross income (AGI) to TPI, which is the sum of all 
positive income values appearing on a return with losses treated as 
zero, to ensure that high income returns were not able to use losses to 
reduce AGI and appear as low income returns for examination selection 
purposes. The IRS currently publishes examination statistics for 
returns classified by TPI as part of the annual Data Book. Based on tax 
year 2018 filings, over 98 percent of individual returns had less than 
$400,000 TPI.
                       irs fy 2024 budget request
    Question. The President's FY 2024 budget request requests around 
$29 billion in additional mandatory funding for enforcement and 
attributes around $105 billion in deficit reduction to this funding. 
This suggests the calculation of a return on investment (ROI) of 4.6.

    The IRS FY 2024 Budget Justification includes ROI's for various 
enforcement programs that range from an ROI of 33.2 for collections in 
FY 2022 to an ROI of 2.2 for Examinations in FY 2020.

    How was the ROI for the request for new mandatory funding made in 
the FY 2024 budget request calculated? Which enforcement programs would 
receive additional funding, and what specific ROI was assumed for those 
programs.

    Is mandatory funding for enforcement, either already enacted or 
requested, allocated to maximize revenues or to achieve a policy or 
social outcome?

    Answer. IRS research maintains detailed historical records for 
enforcement programs that allow for the calculation of the return on 
investment of enforcement spending. To estimate revenue for the budget 
proposal, the IRS used these ROIs to generate revenue estimates for 
extending investments funded by the Inflation Reduction Act because IRA 
enforcement funding expires in 2031.

               Questions Submitted by Hon. James Lankford
    Question. According to a February 2023 GAO report (GAO-23-104719), 
the IRS suspended initiatives to replace the Individual Master File 
(IMF), including the Customer Account Data Engine 2. The IRS Inflation 
Reduction Act Strategic Operating Plan projects retiring the Individual 
Master File (IMF) by fiscal year 2028.

    Given the suspended initiatives and high-level explanations in the 
strategic operating plan, please provide a breakdown of costs by fiscal 
year to achieve retirement of the IMF by FY 2028.

    What is the timeline to deliver a comprehensive IT modernization 
plan with specific time frames and cost tracking?

    Answer. Retiring the IMF is incredibly complex, and we have 
developed an aggressive for doing so. We currently estimate the 
breakdown of costs by fiscal year as follows and will update estimated 
spending in future updates of the IRS Inflation Reduction Act Strategic 
Operating Plan (SOP) and budget submissions.

    If the total allocated funding--whether from discretionary or 
mandatory Business Systems Modernization (BSM)--falls below the 
estimated costs, then delivery of IMF Modernization will be delayed, 
with potential impacts such as: taxpayers will not receive faster 
account updates and real time data/view of their actions with IRS; 
refunds will not be provided faster or account adjustments like 
payments posting quicker; calls for assistance will continue impacting 
level of service without faster/more available information to share 
with taxpayers.

    The IRS SOP represents an integrated holistic plan for how we will 
deliver transformational change for taxpayers. It supersedes any 
previous IRS strategic planning documents including the IRS Integrated 
Modernization Business Plan. There is no intention to release a 
separate technology modernization plan because comprehensive technology 
modernization is woven into the IRA SOP. The SOP assumed that 
modernization would be funded from a combination of IRA and annual 
discretionary BSM funding. Full success is dependent on restoring the 
annual BSM funding that was eliminated in the FY 2023 appropriations 
bill. Time frames and cost tracking will be reflected within 
supplemental budget materials and progress reporting. Additionally, the 
IRS will continue to submit reports on major information technology 
project activities to the Appropriations Committees and to the 
Government Accountability Office. These reports will include detailed, 
plain language explanations of the cumulative expenditures and schedule 
performance to date, any changes in schedule, and current risks and 
mitigation strategies.

    Question. The Taxpayer Advocate Service has advocated adopting 
multiple measures of customer service measurements, including the First 
Contact Resolution metric. The measure would account for the percentage 
of calls that are resolved on the first attempt, without the agent 
needing to refer the taxpayer to a colleague, their manager, or calling 
the taxpayer back. Taxpayers and Congress deserve to have the full 
understanding of how the IRS is bringing resolution to taxpayer's 
inquiries, especially during high call volume times during tax season.

    What is currently preventing the IRS from adopting the First 
Contact Resolution Metric? Could the metric be applied for the 2024 tax 
season?

    Answer. The IRS is implementing its new SOP. First Contact 
Resolution is one of the key performance indicators that we are 
exploring. Part of the IRS customer service strategy is to adopt an 
omnichannel service that seamlessly routes customers between channels 
and service representatives to get them to the right person quickly and 
resolve their issue in a single contact. The IRS will need to ensure it 
has the right data and policies in place to define and assess progress 
toward the goal of resolving issues on the first contact accurately and 
consistently. In addition, the IRS is exploring ways to measure 
effectiveness of service channels more broadly than just phone service. 
As we move toward more self-service and automated options, we want to 
ensure all service points are effective. Instituting First Contact 
Resolution as a key performance indicator would be complex and we are 
still exploring this as an option.

    Question. The IRS Inflation Reduction Act Strategic Operating Plan 
notes the use of digital transformation dollars to enable flexibility 
for all employees and points to the need for employees to ``have 
control over how and where work gets done.'' However, the plan does not 
go into detail on current work-from-home policies or estimates on costs 
for the expanse of policy. As such, please provide the following 
information.

    What is the current work-from-home policy for the IRS by 
department? Please provide the number of employees that are working 
full time from home and employees that have a hybrid model option.

    Answer. The IRS offers telework as a workplace flexibility for 
employees across the agency; the IRS does not have a separate policy by 
business unit, excluding Chief Counsel. Additionally, the 2022 national 
agreement with the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) contains 
provisions on telework for bargaining unit employees. Approval for 
participation in the IRS telework program is within a supervisor's 
authority and is not guaranteed for an employee. Telework may not be 
suited for all positions and is not an employee entitlement. The 
operational needs of the IRS are paramount. The mission of the IRS, 
roles and responsibilities of a particular office, and the extent that 
the employee meets the eligibility requirements determine how often and 
to what extent a supervisor approves telework.

    The IRS does not currently offer permanent, full-time telework to 
any employees. The only exception would be those with an approved 
reasonable accommodation. Employees are offered three types of telework 
options: ad hoc, recurring, or frequent telework.\12\ Under each of 
these IRS telework options, an employee is required to report to their 
official post of duty a minimum of twice per pay period as required by 
OPM and Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) section 6.800.2, IRS Telework 
Program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\ A telework agreement is required for all types of telework. 
Under a recurring telework agreement, eligible employees work from an 
approved telework location (typically home) and perform recurring work 
assignments for 80 hours or less per month. Recurring telework is 
appropriate for low hours of repeat telework. Under a frequent telework 
agreement, eligible employees work from an approved telework location 
(typically home) and perform regular and recurring duties for more than 
80 hours each month. Under an ad hoc telework agreement, eligible 
employees telework on a short-term or episodic basis at the approved 
telework location (typically home). Ad hoc telework is not appropriate 
for repeat instances of telework over time. It requires that an 
employee request and receive manager approval in advance of each 
instance of telework. See IRM 6.800.2.3.1.3.1, available at https://
www.irs.gov/irm/part6/irm_06-800-002.

    Currently, the IRS is testing a remote work project to assess 
whether remote work can become a permanent workplace flexibility. This 
15-month project began on March 12, 2023. We will measure key 
performance indicators during this period. Those measures include: 
productivity; technology; collaboration; and location and physical 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
workspace.

    Question. Please provide what IRS departments you expect to expand 
work-from-home policies and costs associated with the expansion.

    Answer. The IRS must remain compliant with Departmental 
requirements and abide by the NTEU 2022 National Agreement and any 
other NTEU negotiated agreements. The IRS offers telework as a 
workplace flexibility for its employees. However, approval for 
participation in the IRS telework program is within a supervisor's 
authority and is not guaranteed for an employee. Telework may not be 
suited for all positions and is not an employee entitlement. The 
operational needs of the IRS are paramount. The mission of the IRS, 
roles and responsibilities of a particular office, and the extent to 
which the employee meets the eligibility requirements determine how 
often and to what extent a supervisor approves telework. The IRS 
launched a 15-month Remote Work Project to a limited IRS population in 
March 2023. It is too early to determine the cost-savings of this new 
workplace flexibility. Currently, the IRS does not have plans to 
introduce any expanded work-from-home policies.

    Question. How are you going to ensure that taxpayer services is not 
negatively impacted by employees working from home? Please provide what 
systems you will put in place to ensure that employees are doing their 
necessary duties.

    Answer. Not all IRS positions are eligible for telework. For 
example, employees who perform certain face-to-face compliance 
activities, regular face-to-face interactions, tax return processing 
and correspondence, handle more than intermittent mail volume, have a 
recurring need to shred documents, or work with high security and/or 
highly sensitive documents that may not be transported to an alternate 
worksite are not eligible.

    Moreover, for any employee to participate and to continue 
participating in the IRS's telework program, they must receive a 
``fully successful'' rating on their annual review. Any employee who 
does not receive a ``fully successful'' rating is removed from the 
telework program and is required to work from their official post of 
duty until their next rating of record is completed. The Telework 
Program Office and the business unit telework leads in each business 
unit manage the process of removing employees. Performance management 
is the responsibility of each employee's manager. IRS business units 
set the goals and metrics for each employee's annual review to ensure 
employees meet the business unit's goals, and, thereby, IRS goals.

    IRS employees continue to work to deliver for taxpayers. IRS 
employees worked throughout the COVID-19 pandemic delivering results 
for taxpayers including hundreds of millions of Economic Impact 
Payments and advanced payments of the Child Tax Credit. We have 
continued to improve our service, eliminating return and Employee 
Retention Tax Credit processing backlogs, and reaching an 87-percent 
Level of Service on our main taxpayer help line.

    Question. The IRS Fiscal Year 2024 budget cites a 145-day average 
to hire. What, if any, consultation has the IRS has sought from OPM to 
address accelerating hiring to accomplish its workforce needs?

    Answer. The IRS requested and received approval for three direct 
hire authorities from OPM and will request extensions as necessary. Our 
ability to have immediate access to the applicants and to make 
immediate job offers not only increased the rate of acceptance but has 
also resulted in onboarding applicants using direct hire authority in 
an average of 56 days, a savings of 94 days in comparison to the 
delegated examining process.

    Question. A 2019 GAO report found that it takes 4 to 5 years to 
train a new hire to become an experienced senior or expert revenue 
officer at the IRS. The IRS Inflation Reduction Act Strategic Operating 
Plan projects that 63 percent of the IRS workforce becoming eligible 
for retirement over the next 6 years and then another 4 to 5 years of 
training to make up for the loss of skill.

    What are you doing to address the almost 12 years of IRS training 
gaps?

    Answer. To address training gaps, the IRS is redesigning and 
revising its training curricula to align to the various competency 
levels for a given position and for delivery using a blended learning 
approach. We're revising the training in a modular fashion. This 
practice will allow us to provide flexibility to address any competency 
gaps identified by targeted modules without an employee having to 
retake the entire training. We've also developed career path guides for 
Mission Critical Occupations (MCOs). These guides help IRS employees 
progress into more complex positions in their occupational series. The 
guides also provide training for a different position. Consistent with 
the Taxpayer First Act (TFA) training strategy, the IRS is using 
technology to enhance the employee training experience and ensure they 
have resources on the job to support their training and development 
needs.

    In fiscal year 2024, the IRS plans to launch IRS University. This 
will be a corporate training organization with a blended learning model 
that uses a combination of traditional classroom training, virtual 
training, asynchronous (self-directed) learning, on the job 
instruction, and coaching to optimize training and development 
activities for various positions. This will allow the IRS to tailor 
training and development activities to equip individuals with the 
competencies required for success in their current role. It will also 
ensure that individuals gain proficiency as they progress in their 
career at the IRS.

    Question. What departments face the steepest learning curves and 
where are early retirements going to be the most impactful to those 
departments?

    Answer. Individual competency levels, position complexity, and the 
quality and level of training support provided to employees all 
influence learning curves. The Wage and Investment, Large Business and 
International, Small Business/Self Employed, Taxpayer Advocate Service, 
and Tax Exempt and Government Entities divisions face the steepest 
learning curves given the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code and 
the challenging nature of their work. It takes time for an individual 
to learn to apply our Nation's tax laws and IRS policy and procedures 
to advise taxpayers, resolve taxpayer issues, examine tax returns, and 
collect taxes.

    The IRS is implementing the TFA Training Strategy included in the 
TFA Report to Congress (2021) to ensure our entire workforce is 
equipped with the competencies necessary to deliver on the IRS mission. 
The TFA Training Strategy will streamline and organize learning and 
development activities. The IRS is establishing a corporate university 
called IRS University that consists of academies and schools with 
specialized curricula. Learning teams are comprised of learning and 
development professionals and technical subject matter experts who will 
identify, develop, acquire, and deliver employee training.

    IRS workforce demographic data and analyses indicate the actual 
retirement eligible population is declining overall. The data indicate 
age is the prime driver of retirements. The IRS permanent/full-time 
workforce has historically maintained a stable age distribution with 53 
percent of the population over age 50. That trend declined to 48.8 
percent in Fiscal Year 2022.

    The percentage of retirement eligible population in the 10 most 
populated MCOs has declined over the past 5 years. The volume of 
retirements has also declined over the past 5 years for the 10 most 
populated MCO positions.

    As the IRS continues to grow under the IRA, this trend is expected 
to continue to decline because our new hires tend to be younger.

              Questions Submitted by Hon. Robert Menendez
    Question. What percentage of users are able to proceed through the 
ID.me enrollment process without any issues?

    Answer. From June 20, 2021 through May 13, 2023, approximately 80 
percent of taxpayers successfully completed the ID.me enrollment 
(verification) process to access IRS services. This pass rate is much 
higher than before the IRS modernized its authentication platform. The 
legacy system the IRS used prior to modernizing resulted in a 40-
percent pass rate on average. The improved pass rate means the IRS has 
been able to reach previously underserved taxpayers.

    This metric excludes taxpayers who voluntarily abandoned the 
verification process without any failures. It also excludes 
verification attempts that ID.me halted due to suspected fraud.

    Question. What percentage of people experience problems with ID.me, 
and what are the main challenges they encounter in using it?

    Answer. From June 20, 2021 through May 13, 2023, 21 percent of new 
users failed a step in the verification process when attempting to 
access IRS services. The two main challenges taxpayers encounter during 
the self-service process are: trouble uploading identity documents (for 
example, blurry images that cannot pass document security checks); and 
failed financial records and telecom verification checks (for example, 
information entered does not match third-party records or third-party 
records for the user do not exist).

    Question. What percentage of filers experiencing issues with ID.me 
are Black, Hispanic, Asian, Asian American, or Pacific Islander?

    Answer. The IRS does not collect data on the race of taxpayers.

    Question. How will you ensure that verification of taxpayers is 
done in an equitable manner?

    Answer. Taxpayer assistance services are in place to ensure all 
taxpayers are able to authenticate in an equitable manner. Any taxpayer 
who encounters issues or fails a step in the self-service verification 
process is given the option to verify on a video call with a trained 
ID.me Trusted Referee. To verify using video call, taxpayers are 
prompted to upload accepted identity documents and show the physical 
copies to an ID.me Trusted Referee. Taxpayers are also given the option 
to start the verification process by going directly to a video call, 
also referred to as Direct to Trusted Referee. Additionally, the ID.me 
Member Support team is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 
days a year at https://help.id.me to assist taxpayers with technical 
issues.

                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Tim Scott
    Question. The delayed processing of payroll tax credits, 
particularly the Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC), is creating 
significant hardship for thousands of small businesses and their 
employees across the country. Employers are now even having to pay ERTC 
tax liabilities prior to receiving ERTC funds, which is further 
exacerbating liquidity hardships in this tight credit and inflationary 
environment. Since your confirmation hearing, the backlog of 941-X 
filings--the IRS form used to apply for ERTC--is now over 929,000. This 
is an increase of 400,000 since December 2022 and over half a million 
since August 2022. I realize you were asked multiple questions 
pertaining to the ERTC backlog during your confirmation hearing in 
February. Your consistent response was that: ``if confirmed, I commit 
to prioritizing this issue.''

    Now that it has been over a month since the Senate voted to confirm 
your nomination, how have you prioritized this issue? What is the IRS 
doing to expedite the processing of the ERTC and reduce the payroll tax 
credit backlog? When will the IRS be in a position to timely deliver 
ERTC and other payroll tax credits to businesses?

    Answer. The IRS has received approximately 3.6 million ERTC claims 
over the course of the program. While we experienced a backlog in 
processing these claims earlier this year, the IRS has cleared the 
backlog. Our current inventory is over 600,000, virtually all of which 
was received within the last 90 days.

    Since enactment, the IRS has taken steps to modify how we process 
the claims to provide better service to businesses, but we've faced 
challenges in ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the credits. These 
challenges stem from the ERTC's complicated eligibility requirements, 
limited data availability, resources to process claims and balance 
phone demand, limited enforcement resources, and the aggressive 
promotion of ERTC schemes.

    As we worked to get current with our inventory this summer, we 
noticed a fundamental change taking place with a growing amount of 
aggressive marketing touting misleading information about the 
requirements and documentation necessary to qualify for the credit. 
This is adding risk for businesses improperly claiming the credit at 
the advice of these promoters. They are scamming many small businesses 
who fall victim to the aggressive marketing. To protect honest small 
business owners from scams, the IRS announced an immediate moratorium 
starting on September 14, 2023 through at least the end of the year on 
processing new ERTC claims. The moratorium will help protect taxpayers 
by adding a new safety net onto this program to focus on fraudulent 
claims and scammers taking advantage of honest taxpayers.

    During the moratorium, the IRS will continue to work ERTC claims 
filed prior to September 14, 2023. However, because of increased fraud 
concerns, we're undertaking stricter compliance reviews for these 
claims. That means that the processing times for them will be longer, 
increasing from 90 days to 180 days and perhaps longer if a claim faces 
further review or audit. We may also seek additional documentation from 
taxpayers to ensure their claims are legitimate. Payouts for these 
claims will continue during the moratorium period but at a slower pace 
due to the detailed compliance reviews. The detailed compliance reviews 
will include audit work and criminal investigations on promoters and 
businesses filing dubious claims. These enhanced compliance reviews of 
existing claims submitted before the moratorium are critical to protect 
against fraud but also to protect businesses from facing penalties or 
interest payments stemming from bad claims pushed by promoters.

    The IRS is developing new initiatives to help businesses who found 
themselves victims of aggressive promoters. The first is to provide 
businesses an opportunity to withdraw current claims. Tax professionals 
report they have businesses ready to come in after realizing they had 
been lured into claiming the credit. This option will allow the 
taxpayers, many of them small businesses who were misled by promoters, 
to avoid possible repayment issues and paying promoters contingency 
fees. Filers of these more than 600,000 claims awaiting processing will 
have this option available. In addition, we also are exploring a 
voluntary disclosure program for repayments for those who received an 
improper ERTC payment.

    Question. Can you speak to how you plan to leverage modern cloud-
based commercial technology to improve IRS operations, taxpayer 
experience, case selection and anomaly detection to prevent fraud, 
etc.? And will you be leveraging those proven commercial technology 
systems to retire failing legacy systems?

    Answer. We have leveraged cloud-based commercial technology for 
more than a decade and consider cloud our single most important guiding 
principle for our information technology enterprise's architecture. 
Many if not most of our public-facing services, such as IRS.gov, are 
operated from the cloud. In addition, we use numerous software as 
service capabilities for service delivery, which traditionally have 
``low code'' capabilities that require less customization than custom-
build platforms. Looking ahead, we will continue to leverage proven 
commercial technology systems to improve IRS operations across the full 
range of mission-critical work:

          Transforming the IRS data ecosystem. We are moving to a data 
        architecture on par with institutions of similar size and scale 
        as the IRS. For example, the agency's Enterprise Data Platform 
        is a cloud-based platform built using cloud-native tools and 
        developed as a component-based open architecture. It will 
        deliver universal data access for authorized users and systems 
        at the enterprise level, meeting a range of needs while also 
        supporting case management workflows. We protect data within 
        our Enterprise Data Platform while at-rest and in-transit using 
        strong encryption to ensure only appropriate and authorized 
        use.

          Cloud-smart acceleration. Many of the IRS's information 
        systems already operate in the cloud, particularly those 
        providing customer-facing services. The IRS is investing 
        heavily in building its new modernized systems and transforming 
        legacy systems to leverage the benefits of the cloud. We are 
        using cloud-native technologies and services to accelerate 
        time-to-market and automatic scalability for new capabilities 
        that quickly improve the taxpayer experience. One of our 
        guiding principles is cloud smart. This means that building to 
        an on-premise infrastructure is the destination of last resort, 
        only to be considered after we've fully exhausted viable cloud 
        alternatives.

          Transforming the enterprise IT architecture. We are shifting 
        to an event-based architecture that is modular and technology-
        agnostic. By using common services and micro-services, we can 
        process in real or near real-time and quickly change tools and 
        technologies to keep up with industry advancements. This 
        approach allows us to stack technologies more quickly and more 
        efficiently and to provide taxpayers with a personalized and 
        seamless customer service experience. We're also enhancing 
        customer service by offering self-service capabilities through 
        cloud-based tools, such as chatbots and voicebots, and 
        providing employees with access to these capabilities to 
        address taxpayer requests and concerns more efficiently. An 
        event-based architecture also enables the IRS to more 
        efficiently implement digitalization capabilities that speed up 
        processing time for paper-based submissions and other taxpayer 
        interactions.

                 Questions Submitted by Hon. John Thune
    Question. Earlier this year, South Dakotans experienced severe 
winter storms. My office heard from a number of farmers, ranchers, and 
certified public accountants in the State that experienced significant 
burdens with filing before the March 1st deadline. Some South Dakota 
producers, for example, were forced to delay tax appointments in order 
to clean up the storm's aftermath and tend to their livestock. Farmers 
who file hardcopy returns were especially burdened, as mail services 
were delayed to many rural areas.

    The IRS may postpone deadlines for federally declared disasters, 
but not State-declared disasters. As IRS Commissioner, what do you find 
to be the advantages and disadvantages of allowing State-declared 
disasters eligible for temporary tax relief (that is, extended 
deadlines)?

    Answer. Currently, Internal Revenue Code section 7508A allows the 
IRS to postpone certain deadlines for up to 1 year in response to a 
federally declared disaster, a significant fire, or a terroristic or 
military action. Under Treasury regulations, ``federally declared 
disaster'' includes both a major disaster declared under section 401 of 
the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and 
an emergency declared under section 501 of the Stafford Act.\13\ A 
``significant fire'' is any fire that received assistance under section 
420 of the Stafford Act.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ 26 CFR 1.165-11(b)(1).
    \14\ IRC section 7508A(e).

    The IRS is not in a position to assess or make determinations about 
disasters, damage, local conditions, etc. The IRS does not have a role 
in the declaration process, but instead relies on FEMA. That is why IRS 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
disaster relief definitions are based on the Stafford Act.

    It is important for the IRS to apply a standard across all States 
fairly and consistently. FEMA applies rules across the entire country 
which provides that standard.

    The Governor can request FEMA Individual Assistance along with the 
public assistance already rendered under the Stafford Act (if a 
previous request was denied an appeal can be initiated).

    Question. The IRS Inflation Reduction Act Strategic Operating Plan 
States that ``The IRS has been significantly underfunded for the past 
decade, with a budget reduction of 22 percent in real terms from 2010 
to 2021,'' but that is compared to the agency's all-time high budget of 
2010, which spiked under all-Democratic rule.

    In order to gain a more complete picture of IRS funding, please 
provide the fiscal year appropriation and enacted IRS budget for each 
year from 2000 through 2023, with both the nominal amount and the 
amount adjusted for inflation.

    Answer. Please see attachment.

    Question. Our Nation has a relatively high and stable voluntary tax 
compliance rate. In fact, tax compliance levels remain substantially 
unchanged since at least the 1980s.

    What is the IRS's latest data on the percentage of taxes paid 
voluntarily and on time? Please include the year.

    After enforcement efforts and late payments are taken into account, 
what percentage of taxes were paid? Please include the year.

    Answer. Our latest estimates are for tax years (TYs) 2014 through 
2016. We estimate that 85 percent of taxes were paid voluntarily and on 
time. After considering enforcement efforts and late payments, the 
estimated share of taxes eventually paid is 87 percent.

    The TYs 2014 through 2016 estimates also included projections of 
the tax gap for TYs 2017 through 2019. Based on these projections, 86.1 
percent of taxes are estimated to have been paid voluntarily and on 
time for TYs 2017 through 2019. After enforcement efforts and late 
payments are considered, we project that 87 percent of taxes will 
eventually be paid.

    Question. What percentage of IRS employees are currently working in 
a full-time telework capacity?

    Answer. The IRS does not offer a full-time telework option for its 
employees. The only employees that may have a full-time telework 
agreement are those that have an approved reasonable accommodation that 
requires them to telework full-time. However, the IRS is currently 
testing a remote work project to a small participant group, and it is 
not offered to all employees at this time. The project began in March 
2023 with an anticipated 15-month timeline to test the effectiveness 
and efficiency of remote work in the IRS.

    Question. Was a competitive bid process followed for the $15 
million allocated by the Inflation Reduction Act to study the 
feasibility of a direct ``free'' e-file tax return system? If so, 
please elaborate on the process and the criteria considered.

    Answer. The IRS considered several options for the independent 
third party required by the IRA, including contractors, non-profit 
organizations, academics, and other government agencies. New America is 
a non-partisan, non-profit think tank dedicated to public problem 
solving with expertise in technological change, the tax code, and the 
taxpayer experience of everyday Americans. Professor Ariel Jurow-
Kleiman is a nationally recognized expert on tax law and policy and 
Associate Professor of Law at Loyola Law School. The IRS selected these 
two highly qualified parties because of their expertise in the areas 
needed for an independent evaluation of the study. The IRS entered into 
Gratuitous Services Agreements with both parties, meaning that neither 
is receiving compensation from the IRS for their contributions.

    The IRS's Direct File Report to Congress includes an unbiased 
estimate on the cost of creating and maintaining such a program on an 
annual basis. The cost estimates for the Direct File report are based 
on IRS subject matter experts' experience with launching new IRS 
digital services, and the experience of other digital projects from 
across the Federal Government.

    The cost estimates recognize that providing a Direct File service 
is not a one-time cost. As with most IRS systems, it will need to 
provide ongoing taxpayer support and to keep pace with changes to tax 
law. Therefore, the report includes the cost of building a long-term 
team necessary to develop and maintain Direct File. That team would 
include both Federal employees and contractors.

    The intent of the estimates in the report is twofold. We provide 
Congress with a general estimate of the cost of such a system, 
including the range of uncertainty of such costs. In addition, the 
estimates show the effect of different assumptions, including the 
complexity of the supported tax situations and uptake by taxpayers. In 
particular, we see that costs increase with the number of users, mainly 
due to the cost of providing customer support.

    In its report, the IRS covers both the benefits and operational 
challenges that it will have to consider and overcome if we move 
forward with a Direct File system. Further, as required by the IRA, the 
report includes the opinion of an independent third party that provides 
an independent, external perspective on the IRS's ability to run a 
direct file program.

                                 ______
                                 
                Questions Submitted by Hon. Thom Tillis
    Question. I appreciated our conversation during the April 19th 
Senate Finance Committee hearing regarding the ongoing study of the 
feasibility of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) developing and 
implementing a system to prepare returns for taxpayers or allow them to 
file directly with the IRS using a government-run software. During the 
hearing, Senator Crapo and I both asked you if you believe the IRS 
currently has the authority, without new authorizing legislation and 
appropriations, to develop and implement such a system. As part of the 
study on the feasibility of the IRS providing a free-file tax system, I 
believe it is necessary to address that question.

    Does the IRS require new authorizing legislation and appropriations 
before it would have the authority to develop and implement a free-file 
system? Please provide both your personal view as well as any legal 
opinion held by IRS as an agency.

    Answer. Running a Direct File system does not create a conflict of 
interest for the IRS. Authority for the IRS to run a direct electronic 
filing option is not in question as the IRS possess the authority to 
develop and run such a system. There is substantial precedent for the 
IRS providing assistance and advice to taxpayers to meet their tax 
filing obligations and complete their returns accurately, such as 
through the Tele-File program, that allowed taxpayers to file simple 
tax returns by telephone. For example, we administered the Tele-File 
program that allowed taxpayers to file simple tax returns by telephone. 
The IRS also operates taxpayer assistance centers (TACs), in which IRS 
employees previously provided in-person tax preparation services (note 
that the IRS stopped providing tax return preparation assistance at the 
TACs in 2014). The IRS also offers by phone as well as through 
calculators and other tools on its website, through formal private 
letter rulings, and by partnering with third-party volunteer 
organizations including those participating in the Volunteer Income Tax 
Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) programs to 
provide tax advice. We also launched the new Information Returns Intake 
System (IRIS) application this year, allowing payers to file Forms 1099 
electronically.

    Direct File offers taxpayers an additional option allowing 
taxpayers to accurately and directly file returns for free with the 
IRS. Taxpayers can still use commercial tax filing software, 
professional preparation services, or other options.

              Questions Submitted by Hon. Elizabeth Warren
    Question. For months, House Republicans have threatened to refuse 
to raise the debt ceiling unless Democrats acquiesce to massive 
spending cuts. Last week, Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans 
unveiled their official legislative proposal. Disingenuously entitled 
the Limit, Save, and Grow Act, the bill takes a hacksaw to critical 
government spending.

    One specific provision of the bill targets the IRS. According to 
former IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, the tax gap--the difference 
between true total tax liability and the amount paid on time \15\--sits 
at roughly $1 trillion, due largely to the agency's lack of resources 
to be able to catch tax cheats.\16\ Democrats recognized that the 
solution is to provide the agency with the resources it needs, and 
secured $80 billion in additional funding for the IRS in last year's 
Inflation Reduction Act.\17\ But House Republicans instead want to nix 
that funding.

    By cutting the additional IRS funding passed in the IRA, how would 
the Limit, Save, and Grow Act affect the IRS's ability to go after 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
wealthy tax cheats?

    What impact would cutting this funding have on agency efforts to 
improve taxpayer services for working families?

    What effect would cutting this funding have on tax receipts and on 
the tax gap?

    Answer. We are transforming tax administration to dramatically 
improve service to taxpayers, ensure fairness in all we do, build a 
workplace that attracts and retains top talent, and modernize our 
technology. Inflation Reduction Act funding is an investment that 
complements our annual funding to dramatically improve tax 
administration.

    Cutting Enforcement resources from the IRA funding would halt the 
IRS's efforts to ensure high-income, high-wealth individuals, large 
corporations, and complex partnerships pay the taxes they legally owe, 
undermining the IRS' ability to enforce tax laws with integrity and 
fairness. Our ability to significantly increase audit coverage on high-
income/high-wealth individuals, partnerships, and large corporations 
would be at the unacceptably low levels that we have seen over recent 
years. Whereas audit coverage on Tax Year (TY) 2010 returns was 9.1 
percent for individuals with income over $1 million, it had fallen to 
just 1.6 percent for TY 2018 returns (the last year of complete audit 
coverage data), while the number of returns filed for individuals with 
income over $1 million increased by 91 percent over that same time 
period. The amount of additional recommended tax on those audits fell 
from $1.284 billion to $468 million, a loss of $815 million (not 
accounting for inflation). The IRS audited just 2,700 TY 2018 
partnership returns, versus 15,700 TY 2010 returns, even though the 
number of partnership returns increased by 23 percent over that same 
time period (4.01 million in TY 2018 vs. 3.25 million in TY 2010). 
Audit coverage on corporations with balance sheet assets over $250 
million fell from 28.5 percent on TY 2010 returns to 12.6 percent on TY 
2018 returns, while there were 15 percent more corporations of that 
size, and additional recommended tax was $12.4 billion less for TY 2018 
returns vs. TY 2010 returns.\18\

    \18\ IRS Data Book, 2022, Table 17, and IRS Data Book, 2020, Table 
17, available at https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-all-
years-irs-data-books.

    The IRS delivered dramatically improved service in filing season 
2023. Thanks to the 5,000 new hires made possible by Inflation 
Reduction Act resources, IRS customer service representatives answered 
more than 6.5 million taxpayer calls this year, 2.4 million more calls 
with live assistance since the start of the year through April 7th, 
compared to the same period in 2022. The IRS cut phone wait times to 4 
minutes, down from 27 minutes in filing season 2022. The IRS achieved 
an 87-percent Level of Service (LOS) with live assistance this filing 
season. This is a more than fivefold increase in LOS over filing season 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2022.

    Annual appropriations are a recognition that we need to continue to 
operate while we transform. Both of these funding streams are critical 
to deliver and improve service for taxpayers. Cutting additional IRS 
funding provided by the IRA will increase the tax gap, undermine 
taxpayer services, and compromise the modernization of tax 
administration. For example, the IRS used over $800 million of IRA 
funding (one-quarter of the total in taxpayer services) in FY 2023 to 
provide the significantly higher service levels that you all have heard 
about this past filing season. In future years, if Congress doesn't 
provide sufficient discretionary funding to cover inflation and pay 
raises, we anticipate exhausting all IRA taxpayer services funding by 
the end of FY 2025. This would lead to worse service for our small 
businesses, working families, and other taxpayers: fewer calls 
answered, less help in person at taxpayer assistance centers, and more.

    The IRS has requested in our FY 2024 budget that Congress fund all 
inflationary increases and pay raises. We also requested that it fund 
program increases to add over 4,700 full-time equivalents (FTEs) to 
taxpayer services to pay for increased phone coverage to answer calls 
and assist walk-in taxpayers on regular tax issues. We also need this 
funding to answer questions specific to the Green Tax credits that the 
IRA authorized. The IRS will need continued increases for pay raises 
and inflation on top of the FY 2024 budget level in order to keep our 
overall level of service at high levels through FY 2031, when the IRA 
funding expires.

    Question. A new analysis from Moody's Analytics examines the 
impacts of the cuts proposed by the Limit, Save, and Grow Act. The 
analysis lays out the macroeconomic effects: 780,000 jobs lost by the 
end of 2024 and a roughly 40-percent decrease in GDP growth.\19\ And 
these effects would persist, with nondefense discretionary spending at 
2 percent of GDP by Fiscal Year 2033, its lowest level since the 1960s. 
But as Dr. Mark Zandi, one of the authors of the analysis, noted in a 
hearing of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Subcommittee 
on Economic Policy that I chaired, the estimates produced by Moody's 
models are static, meaning they don't ``account for the economic 
consequences of those cuts on the economy and what that means for 
revenue and spending.''\20\ Dr. Zandi added that taking revenue impacts 
into account would likely increase the effect of the cuts.\21\ A 
proposal like the Limit, Save, and Grow Act that makes massive cuts and 
simultaneously diminishes revenue, then, does not seem to promote 
``growth.''

    What would be the impact on tax receipts of the lessened economic 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
growth caused by the Limit, Save, and Grow Act?

    Answer. The IRS does not maintain models appropriate for the 
macroeconomic analysis of proposed legislation nor does it score 
legislation apart from legislation affecting tax administration. We 
recommend reaching out to the Congressional Budget Office.

                                 ______
                                 
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young
    Question. The most common complaint my office receives about the 
IRS is that Hoosiers still cannot reach anyone via the IRS's customer 
service line. In investigating this issue, I have learned some 
illuminating things about the way the IRS measures its phone 
performance, which make me wonder if the IRS is evaluating the right 
things to actually measure and improve the service taxpayers are 
receiving. For example, the IRS apparently does not track how long it 
takes callers to navigate through the automated screening systems for 
the IRS's toll-free lines, measures average ``wait times'' by only 
looking at callers who successfully connect to a live or automated 
assistor, and considers a live assistor call to be ``answered'' the 
moment an assistor connects to a caller on hold regardless of whether 
the call continues from that point.

    The IRS has also long portrayed its reported phone data as 
reflecting the entire universe of its toll-free phone performance, or 
allowed the data to be characterized as such, when in fact the stats 
are being reported only for a fraction of the hundred-plus toll-free 
lines the IRS operates.

    Would you agree that it is imperative that the IRS increases its 
transparency in how it reports phone data and also enhances the scope 
and utility of information it collects, yes or no?

    Answer. The IRS currently reports phone data for all public-facing 
toll-free phone lines in various forums, including the Treasury 
Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), Government 
Accountability Office (GAO), congressional briefings, congressional 
budget requests, and to the public on irs.gov. Additionally, phone 
performance is a topic for congressional hearings and media requests, 
that provide additional avenues for public awareness.

    Question. Will you commit to having measures in place before next 
filing season to do these things, and if so, what will those measures 
be?

    Answer. In addition to the publicly shared information, an IRS 
project team is working to identify the best metrics to provide a more 
complete view of the taxpayer experience. This team conducted a 
benchmark study of private business, other government agencies, and 
other countries' tax administration performance metrics, with specific 
focus on call sites to determine the data being reported by other 
organizations. In 2024, we will begin testing new performance metrics 
as recommended by this team, with the goal of fully implementing the 
metrics by 2025. This time frame allows for modifying existing systems 
and reports, testing the data and outcomes, and confirming data 
accuracy and integrity.

    Question. Some of my Senate Finance colleagues and I wrote a letter 
to your predecessor regarding a company called ``EnQ'' that floods the 
IRS with robocalls and sells front-of-the-line access to individuals 
who pay as much as $1,000 a year.

    Do you believe taxpayers should have to pay money to a private 
company in order to reach someone at the IRS in a timely manner?

    Answer. No, taxpayers should not have to pay money to a private 
company in order to reach someone at the IRS in a timely manner. These 
types of companies came into existence in response to inadequate 
resources that left IRS staff unable to meet increased telephone demand 
in past years. The IRS leveraged Inflation Reduction Act funds in the 
2023 filing season along with its annual discretionary budget to 
provide an exemplary Customer Service Representative Level of Service 
(LOS) of 87 percent. As a result, we saw some robocall services reduce 
the number of calls.

    Question. Do robocall services such as EnQ ultimately increase wait 
times on the IRS call lines?

    Answer. Yes, robocall services have the potential to increase wait 
times on the IRS call lines. However, in many instances these services 
don't have a paid subscriber on the line when the IRS assistor answers 
the call. These short calls are considered answered and reduce handling 
times on the IRS call lines. In addition to potentially increasing wait 
times, robocall services have the ability to deny service to taxpayers 
who are unwilling or unable to pay for what should be a free service.

    The IRS is partnering with industry leaders to identify solutions 
to nuisance calls from bots. The IRS completed a 6-month pilot from 
October 2022 to March 2023 on the Practitioner Priority line. The pilot 
used speech recognition to help ensure a live person was calling and 
not an automated system. The pilot was successful in reducing the 
number of calls from bots during a low Level of Service (37.5 percent) 
period from October 2022 through December 2022. However, because the 
IRS experiences more bot calls during periods with lower LOS, the 
increased staffing for the 2023 filing season, which improved the LOS 
to 87 percent, played a more significant role in changing calling 
behavior from companies owning bots. The average answer speed during 
the first half of the pilot (October 2022 to December 2022) was 27 
minutes compared to 3 minutes in the second half of the pilot (January 
2023 to March 2023).

    The IRS continues to research alternatives to combat bots. We plan 
to launch another 6-month pilot with a second technology vendor in 
January 2023.

    Question. In response to a question asked by my colleague, Senator 
Blackburn, during your live questioning, you noted that during your 
first few weeks as Commissioner you had focused your time asking 
several questions, including whether the IRS was ``. . . in [its] 
Taxpayer Assistance Centers and walk-in centers keeping the lines 
short, meeting all of [its] appointments . . . ,'' and you commented 
that it was. This stands in contrast to what I heard from my 
constituents at the beginning of this year. Specifically, many of my 
constituents struggled to get appointments as they were unable to get 
through to the nationwide telephone scheduling service to set up said 
appointments and were unable to set up walk-in appointments as many of 
the centers were not open during regular business hours.

    In response to the questions for the record submitted following 
your nomination hearing before the Senate Finance Committee earlier 
this year, you committed to ``ensuring taxpayers can access Taxpayer 
Assistance Centers.''

    Can you please provide updated data, broken down by city and State, 
on the number of Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) that are currently 
fully staffed and open for walk-in appointments during normal business 
hours?

    Answer. If a TAC is not operating during normal business hours, 
it's generally due to employee attrition. However, we are focused on 
hiring to fully staff our TACs and keep them open to assist taxpayers.

    Question. For the centers that are not operating during normal 
business hours, can you please provide information on why this is the 
case and how the IRS plans to ensure taxpayers have access to in-person 
TAC services?

    Answer. If a TAC is not open and operating during normal business 
hours, it's generally due to employee attrition. However, we are 
focused on hiring to fully staff our TACs and keep them open to assist 
taxpayers. (Please see attachment). With IRA funding, we will enable 
taxpayers to schedule service through digital and in-person channels. 
We are also developing a plan to provide estimated wait times and on-
demand service through all channels, including at TACs.

Note: Updates as of 10/17/2023.


    Question. Earlier this year following your nomination hearing, you 
stated in response to a question for the record related to the 
ProPublica leak, where troves of confidential taxpayer information were 
leaked to the public:

        Working with this committee and other oversight entities will 
        be an important priority of mine, if confirmed. I commit to 
        learning more about this issue and timely follow-up with you 
        and this committee, in line with applicable laws and 
        regulations.

    Since your swearing in on April 4, 2023, have you requested a 
status update on the ProPublica investigation from the Office of 
Inspector General, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax 
Administration, and the Department of Justice, yes or no?

    Answer. Yes.

    Question. If your response is ``yes,'' please provide details as to 
the dates and relevant offices for each and every status update request 
you have placed during that time. If your response is ``no,'' please 
explain why you have not requested a status update despite your 
commitment to learning more about this matter in a timely manner. If 
you requested status updates prior to April 4, 2023, please provide 
details on those inquiries.

    Answer. We cannot comment about law enforcement procedures outside 
IRS authority. This matter falls under the jurisdiction of the 
appropriate authorities, TIGTA and the Department of Justice. These 
authorities conduct their investigations, and any related briefings, 
independently.

    Question. At any point following your March 9, 2023, confirmation, 
have you or anyone on your staff briefed the Senate Finance Committee 
chairman or majority staff on the matter, yes or no? If your answer is 
``yes,'' please provide dates and attendee details.

    Answer. As noted in the prior response, the appropriate authorities 
conduct their investigations, and any related briefings, independently.

    Question. As the IRS looks to bring in additional contract workers 
to continue to address the processing backlog, what guardrails has the 
IRS put in place to ensure that a leak like ProPublica does not happen 
again?

    Answer. Protecting taxpayer information is a fundamental IRS 
principle. We continue to leverage congressionally provided funds to 
implement a multilayered information protection strategy. We also 
continuously identify and implement the most current cybersecurity 
protections available. Guard rails that help ensure the protection of 
taxpayer data include:

          Policy: Taxpayers have a right to privacy and 
        confidentiality. The IRS protects taxpayer information, and 
        discloses such information only as authorized by the taxpayer 
        or by law. The IRS takes appropriate action against government 
        employees, return preparers, and others who wrongfully use or 
        disclose taxpayer return information. The IRS fosters a culture 
        of privacy and confidentiality. We ensure that employee and 
        contractor access to information is limited to what is relevant 
        and necessary to administer the tax laws.

          Training: Every employee, must complete mandatory training 
        which clearly defines when access to taxpayer information is 
        authorized. The training also details the consequences of 
        unauthorized access and disclosure under IRC section 6103. 
        Consequences include potential termination of employment, 
        fines, and imprisonment.\22\ Any unauthorized disclosure of 
        confidential government information is illegal, and we take 
        allegations or indications of any such disclosures seriously.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \22\ See IRC Sections 7213 (criminal penalty for unauthorized 
disclosure) and 7431 (civil damages provision).

          Protective Controls: The IRS implemented the Privileged User 
        Management and Access System (PUMAS) to manage privileged 
        access accounts to servers, mainframes, and network devices. 
        This system also manages software on IRS endpoints with white/
        blacklisting of software applications to ensure we use the most 
        secure technology products. Our Business Entitlement Access 
        Request System (BEARS) allows us to rigorously control who can 
        access what types of data on which system within the IRS using 
        an entitlement approval process that often includes multiple 
        levels of review. We aggressively manage our physical access 
        control systems and other associated physical security 
        measures, limiting facility access to only those with requisite 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        approvals.

          Detective Controls: The IRS has several different methods of 
        monitoring audit logs for multiple security threat and 
        compliance purposes, including Unauthorized Access, which we 
        call UNAX. We evaluate the audit logs and reports on a daily, 
        weekly, and monthly basis. Data availability drives variation 
        of frequency, analytic platform capabilities, and policy. As a 
        result of these efforts, the IRS has processed over 460 
        violations resulting in suspension, resignation, and removal 
        over the past 10 years. The IRS requires that individuals 
        recertify their access to IRS applications on a regular 
        schedule. For ``non-privileged'' roles such as an employee's 
        access to the agency's official timekeeping system, the 
        recertification process occurs annually. For ``privileged'' 
        roles, the recertification process occurs every 6 months.

          Oversight: TIGTA regularly audits employee access to 
        taxpayer information. As required by law, the IRS provides an 
        annual report to the Joint Committee on Taxation that describes 
        disclosures of taxpayer information during the year and the 
        statutory authorization for each type of disclosure. GAO also 
        provides oversight on the protection of taxpayer information. 
        IRS systems undergo a variety of assessments throughout the 
        year to test the efficiency of the detection and protective 
        controls we have in place.

    Question. Based on your testimony, I understand the IRS is 
preparing to spend vast sums of taxpayer dollars on data warehousing 
and analytics. There is a significant debate underway in our country 
about Big Tech, privacy, and misuse of data. How are you going to avoid 
the IRS becoming the focal point of that discussion?

    Answer. The IRS is building an enterprise data platform that will 
store the data we use to fulfill our diverse missions, from performing 
research and analysis to fighting identify theft. We are building the 
platform in the cloud, which will allow us to proactively weave 
protective and detective data security controls directly into the 
platform's operational fabric. This development comes as a contrast to 
dated data security management approaches in which data security 
controls are wrapped around platforms, or ``bolted on.'' The platform 
will also absorb thousands of databases we use in our current 
operations, which are individually operated and secured.

    While we have always been a data-centric organization and have a 
robust, multi-layered data protection strategy, we have taken strategic 
steps to ensure that posture does not change as we begin to embrace the 
promise of automation and analytics more fully. We very deliberately 
established responsible, ethical use of data as a core principle in the 
Strategic Operating Plan (SOP). Reinforcing this, we are standing up a 
Data Security Executive Steering Committee. The committee will focus 
executive attention on advancing how we protect taxpayer and mission-
support data to enable the IRS to achieve its priorities, build agency 
credibility, and develop taxpayer trust. This Executive Steering 
Committee will take a cross-
functional, collaborative approach to ensuring data security guiding 
principles.

    Additionally, in 2022, we initiated a security and privacy program 
focused on increasing the rigor of our application of ``least 
privilege.'' Within this program, users have the minimum amount of data 
required to fulfill their responsibilities in data and analytics. This 
program has greatly strengthened our security posture, ushering in 
opportunities for data segmentation, advanced data classification, 
anonymity, streamlined access controls, enhanced auditing and 
monitoring, the use of data loss prevention tools, and the development 
of security and privacy awareness training. Finally, the IRS has 
dedicated staff who are developing training, tools, and policies that 
we will use to validate analytics and models before implementation. We 
will ensure the analytics training models are not subject to bias and 
work as expected.

    Question. In response to my question for the record submitted 
following your nomination hearing this year, you committed to (i) 
investigating whether high net worth individuals' tax information is 
set aside in a separate location (whether physically or electronically) 
from the taxpayer information of the general population, and (ii) 
reporting back to me and the committee on your findings within 4 months 
of confirmation.

    Can you please reaffirm your commitment to conducting that 
investigation and maintaining the requested timeline for reporting back 
to me and the committee?

    Answer. We take the security of all taxpayer data seriously; all 
data is protected in the same way. We have the same security standards 
for all taxpayers.

    Question. Last year, my Democratic colleagues enacted a 1-percent 
excise tax on stock buybacks as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. At 
the time, my constituents expressed concern over the lack of clarity as 
to how that tax would be applied to preferred stocks. While there was 
initially an indication that the IRS would exempt preferred stocks from 
this excise tax, recently released guidance indicates that the IRS is 
going to take the position that the tax does apply. This interpretation 
seems out of line with the general intent of the new law.

    As an example, let's say a corporation has outstanding common stock 
that is traded on an established securities market, as well as 
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock that is not traded on an 
established securities market. The preferred stock is stock for Federal 
tax purposes. On January 1, 2023, that same corporation redeems the 
preferred stock pursuant to its terms. Under some practitioners' 
interpretation of the IRS's Notice 2023-2,\23\ redemption by the 
corporation of its mandatorily redeemable preferred stock would be 
considered a repurchase and is therefore taxed as such.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \23\ https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-02.pdf.

    Do you agree with the interpretation that, pursuant to the IRS's 
initial guidance, the 1-percent excise tax would apply in this 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
circumstance, yes or no? Why or why not?

    Answer. Yes. Notice 2023-2 explicitly addresses the fact pattern 
that you described above. Example 1 of Notice 2023-2 \24\ provides a 
fact pattern in which a corporation (Corporation X) has outstanding 
common stock that is traded on an established securities market, as 
well as mandatorily redeemable preferred stock that is not traded on an 
established securities market. Example 1 further provides that (i) the 
Corporation X preferred stock is stock for Federal tax purposes, and 
(ii) on January 1, 2023, Corporation X redeems the preferred stock 
pursuant to its terms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \24\ Notice 2023-2, section 3.09(1) (entitled ``Example 1: 
Redemption of Preferred Stock'').

    Based on this fact pattern, Example 1 provides the following 
analysis and conclusion: ``The redemption by Corporation X of its 
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock is a repurchase because (i) 
Corporation X redeemed an instrument that is stock for Federal tax 
purposes (that is, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock issued by 
Corporation X), and (ii) the redemption by Corporation X is a [Internal 
Revenue Code (IRC)] Sec. 1A317(b) redemption.''\25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \25\ Id.

    Accordingly, all practitioners should interpret Notice 2023-2, and 
the excise tax statute, as providing that a redemption by a corporation 
of its mandatorily redeemable preferred stock is a repurchase and 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
therefore is taxed as such under the excise tax statute.

    Question. If your answer to previous question is ``yes,'' please 
explain whether you believe this outcome is consistent with the 
Inflation Reduction Act.

    Answer. The first rule of the excise tax statute provides that the 
tax is imposed on ``the fair market value of any stock of the 
corporation which is repurchased by such corporation during the taxable 
year.''\26\ Similarly, that statute defines a ``repurchase'' to mean 
``a redemption within the meaning of [IRC] Sec. 317(b) with regard to 
the stock of a covered corporation'' and any transaction determined to 
be economically similar to such a redemption.\27\ Congress's decision 
not to provide any exception for preferred stock (or any other type of 
stock) is confirmed by IRC 4501(f)(2), in which Congress explicitly 
requested the Treasury Department to consider regulations or other 
guidance to address special classes of stock and preferred stock.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \26\ IRC section 4501(a) (emphasis added).
    \27\ IRC section 4501(c)(1) (emphasis added).

    Notice 2023-2 mirrors the excise tax statute by defining the term 
``stock'' in relevant part to mean ``any instrument issued by a 
corporation that is stock or that is treated as stock for Federal tax 
purposes at the time of issuance.''\28\ To implement Congress's request 
that the Treasury Department consider special treatment for preferred 
stock and other special classes of stock, Notice 2023-2 provides the 
following request for public comments:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \28\ Notice 2023-2, section 3.02(25) (providing a definition for 
the term ``stock'') (emphasis added).

        Are there circumstances under which special rules should be 
        provided for redeemable preferred stock or other special 
        classes of stock or debt (including debt with features that 
        allow the debt, whether by the issuer, the holder, or 
        otherwise, to be converted into stock)? If so, please provide 
        objectively verifiable criteria that such special rules should 
        incorporate to provide certainty for taxpayers and the IRS.\29\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \29\ Notice 2023-2, section 6.01(1) (under the heading entitled 
``Comments Regarding Rules Included in Notice'').

    The Treasury Department will consider such public comments for 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
purposes of the proposed excise tax regulations.

    Question. As part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRS received 
over $80 billion in additional funding. At the request of Congress, on 
April 6th, the IRS released the Internal Revenue Service Inflation 
Reduction Act Strategic Operating Plan detailing how the agency would 
allocate the appropriated funds. It is important for members of 
Congress in our oversight role and for the public at large to be 
educated on and understand the IRS's plans for the $80 billion. 
Therefore, this topic deserves public discussion. We discussed this 
issue in a private Senate Finance Committee member briefing, but I 
wanted to ensure my concerns here are noted in the record.

    Will you be willing to testify before the Senate Finance Committee 
before the end of June 2023 on the IRS's Strategic Operating Plan, yes 
or no?

    Answer. Yes. I intend to regularly update Senate Finance Committee 
members on the IRS's progress toward the SOP goals. We are committed to 
transparency and want to regularly highlight the progress we are 
making. For example, we have committed to report to Congress quarterly 
on actual obligations and number of full-time employees, and we are 
posting quarterly management updates on IRS.gov.\30\ In addition, in 
the first full year of the IRA, we have published results \31\ from 
improvements like increased levels of service, new online taxpayer 
tools, new digital forms, increased scanning, customer call back 
features, with much more to come.

                                 ______
                                 
                 Prepared Statement of Hon. Ron Wyden, 
                       a U.S. Senator From Oregon
    This morning the Finance Committee welcomes Commissioner Werfel 
back to the Senate to discuss the IRS budget and this filing season, 
which came to a close yesterday.

    Let me start off by thanking the staff at the IRS for their hard 
work that made this the smoothest filing season in many years. 
Democrats made a big investment in taxpayer service with the Inflation 
Reduction Act, and it goes without saying that taxpayers have a right 
to know what they got with that investment.

    The numbers paint a clear picture. Last filing season, the IRS was 
able to answer 15 percent of the phone calls it got. This year it was 
87 percent. The IRS answered 2 million more calls and helped 100,000 
more taxpayers in person. The return backlog is way down. Tech upgrades 
are helping get refunds out the door more quickly. A big improvement 
all the way around.

    Next, looking ahead, right at the top of our agenda is reducing the 
tax gap. The official estimate says that $540 billion of taxes owed go 
unpaid each year. Other estimates, even from Donald Trump's IRS 
Commissioner, say it could be $1 trillion. Those estimates are so far 
apart because sophisticated, wealthy tax cheats excel at hiding in the 
shadows. The IRS can't measure the law-breaking that's going on if it 
doesn't have the resources to identify it in the first place.

    Here's the bottom line on this issue. You cannot get at the tax gap 
without focusing on wealthy tax cheats and highly complex businesses 
like large partnerships. That's what Democrats sought to accomplish 
with the tax enforcement funding in the Inflation Reduction Act. The 
IRS plan for that funding came out a few weeks ago. I'm sure members 
will have a lot to say about it, but it's clear to me that the IRS is 
following the law as intended.

    And the reality is, there are big challenges for the Congress to 
address: shoring up Medicare and Social Security; child care and 
education for families; paid leave for workers. Both sides want to 
address our country's fiscal health. Reducing the tax gap helps create 
the headroom to address those issues.

    If the first priority is making it harder for wealthy tax cheats to 
get away with breaking the law, the next priority is making tax filing 
easier for everybody else. The Inflation Reduction Act took an 
important step on a free, direct-filing system. It would provide 
another option for taxpayers who are sick of the hassle and expense 
that comes with filing online today.

    There's a study underway looking at how to go about building such a 
system. Republicans and the tax prep lobby have reacted as if this is 
going to bring on the end of western civilization.

    There used to be bipartisan interest in building a free-file system 
that saved taxpayers time and money every year. Making it easier to 
file was a key component of the tax reform proposal I wrote with 
Senator Dan Coats a little more than decade ago. These days, 
Republicans are siding with the big tax prep companies that squeeze 
Americans for billions of dollars every year with various fees and 
markups. They've even objected to the organization conducting the free-
file study.

    I'm sure Republicans would prefer to have the tax prep lobby in 
charge of studying this issue to smother it from the get-go. It's 
always the same pattern every time this proposal comes up. An army of 
well-paid lawyers and lobbyists descends on the Congress to squash it. 
Republicans are standing with them.

    That cannot happen this time. Democrats are committed to the 
proposition that it shouldn't cost hundreds of dollars and many, many 
hours of time simply to follow the law and pay what you owe. When it 
comes to filing taxes online, the status quo is unacceptable.

    Those are some of the agenda items for Democrats--reducing the tax 
gap by going after the cheating by the wealthy, and making tax filing 
easier for everybody else. What are Republicans up to?

    For all their talk about our country's fiscal health, they're still 
committed to giving billionaires a free pass to cheat on their taxes. 
Speaker McCarthy is also working overtime to rally Republicans around a 
plan that would gut health care and increase hunger among tens of 
millions of Americans. If he doesn't get what he wants, he's 
threatening a catastrophic default.

    The Congress ought to take a smarter approach. That includes making 
sure the IRS can meet the needs of the American people and enforce the 
law when billionaires skip out on paying what they owe.

    There's a lot for us to talk about today. I want to thank 
Commissioner Werfel for joining the committee. I look forward to our 
discussion.

                      Statement of Michael Bindner

Chairman Wyden and Ranking Crapo, thank you for the opportunity to 
address this issue.

It is a tradition to hold a hearing about this time of year concerning 
the IRS filing season. Perhaps this would be better done after most 
refund checks have been mailed and the number of taxpayers filing after 
an extension is known--including their income class.

On the IRS budget, as I mentioned last year, support contractors could 
be more widely used for customer and information technology services. 
This would identify the balance of spending to justify the budget 
request for FY 2024.

Additional analytical resources are required for tax reform initiatives 
such as Fair Tax initiative and exploration of options due to 
expiration of the Trump/Ryan/Brady tax cuts.

The repeal of Roe v. Wade makes returning to the Pandemic era child tax 
credit essential. Increased funding is included in the President's 
Budget.

As we have said before, to end the ``stink of welfare'' that Senator 
Manchin so objects to, CTC payments should be included with wages for 
all employees--not just those with three or more children. They should 
also be distributed through other federal and state assistance 
programs--some of which can be reduced to do so.

For middle-income taxpayers whose increased credits are less than their 
annual tax obligation, a simple change in withholding tables is 
adequate. Procedures are already in place to deliver refundable credits 
to larger families. For the coming year, they merely need to be 
expanded to all families with children.

Employers can work with their bankers to increase funds for payroll 
throughout the year while requiring less money for their quarterly tax 
payments (or estimated taxes) to the IRS. The main issue is working out 
those situations where employers owe less than they pay out. This is 
especially true for labor intensive industries and even more so for 
low-wage employers.

A higher minimum wage would make negative quarterly tax bills less 
likely. Indeed, no one should have to subsist mainly on their child tax 
payments.

Please ask, either orally or in written form, how such a CTC proposal 
might work and how it would make things easier for taxpayers whose 
returns would be simpler--with fewer having to file at all.

As usual, we have attached the latest version of our tax reform plan, 
with a separate attachment on how implementation of this plan would 
affect IRS manpower. The answer is that the change would be drastic. It 
would also allow the Committee to focus more on how social welfare is 
being delivered in general, as well as eliminating current roadblocks 
to promptly filing for Social Security Disability Income.

Thank you, again, for the opportunity to add our comments to the 
debate. Please contact us if we can be of any assistance or contribute 
direct testimony.

Attachment One--Tax Reform, Center for Fiscal Equity, March 24, 2023

Synergy: The President's Budget for 2024 proposes a 25% minimum tax on 
high incomes. Because most high income households make their money on 
capital gains, rather than salaries, an asset value-added tax replacing 
capital gains taxes (both long- and short-term) would be set to that 
rate. The top rate for a subtraction VAT surtax on high incomes (wages, 
dividends and interest paid) would be set to 25%, as would the top rate 
for income surtaxes paid by very high income earners. Surtaxes 
collected by businesses would begin for any individual payee receiving 
$75,000 from any source at a 6.25% rate and top out at 25% at all such 
income over $375,000. At $450,000, individuals would pay an additional 
6.25% on the next $75,000 with brackets increasing until a top rate of 
25% on income over $750,000. This structure assures that no one games 
the system by changing how income is earned to lower their tax burden.

Individual payroll taxes. A floor of $20,000 would be instituted for 
paying these taxes, with a ceiling of $75,000. This lower ceiling 
reduces the amount of benefits received in retirement for higher-income 
individuals. The logic of the $20,000 floor reflects full-time work at 
a $10 per hour minimum wage offered by the Republican caucus in 
response to proposals for a $15 wage. The majority needs to take the 
deal. Doing so in relation to a floor on contributions makes adopting 
the minimum wage germane in the Senate for purposes of Reconciliation. 
The rate would be set at 6.25%.

Employer payroll taxes. Unless taxes are diverted to a personal 
retirement account holding voting and preferred stock in the employer, 
the employer levy would be replaced by a goods and receipts tax of 
6.25%. Every worker who meets a minimum hour threshold would be 
credited for having paid into the system, regardless of wage level. All 
employees would be credited on an equal dollar basis, rather than as a 
match to their individual payroll tax. The tax rate would be adjusted 
to assure adequacy of benefits for all program beneficiaries.

High-income surtaxes. As above, taxes would be collected on all 
individual income taxes from salaries, income and dividends, which 
exclude business taxes filed separately, starting at $400,00 per year. 
This tax will fund net interest on the debt (which will no longer be 
rolled over into new borrowing), redemption of the Social Security 
Trust Fund, strategic, sea and non-continental U.S. military 
deployments, veterans' health benefits as the result of battlefield 
injuries, including mental health and addiction and eventual debt 
reduction.

Asset Value-Added Tax (A-VAT). A replacement for capital gains taxes 
and the estate tax. It will apply to asset sales, exercised options, 
inherited and gifted assets and the profits from short sales. Tax 
payments for option exercises, IPOs, inherited, gifted and donated 
assets will be marked to market, with prior tax payments for that asset 
eliminated so that the seller gets no benefit from them. In this 
perspective, it is the owner's increase in value that is taxed. As with 
any sale of liquid or real assets, sales to a qualified broad-based 
Employee Stock Ownership Plan will be tax free. These taxes will fund 
the same spending items as high income and subtraction VAT surtaxes. 
There will be no requirement to hold assets for a year to use this 
rate. This also implies that this tax will be levied on all eligible 
transactions.

The 3.8% ACA-SM tax will be repealed as a separate tax, with health 
care funding coming through a subtraction value-added tax levied on all 
employment and other gross profit. The 25% rate is meant to be a 
permanent compromise, as above. Any changes to this rate would be used 
to adjust subtraction VAT surtax and high-
income surtax rates accordingly. This rate would be negotiated on a 
world-wide basis to prevent venue seeking for stock trading.

Subtraction Value-Added Tax (S-VAT). Corporate income taxes and 
collection of business and farm income taxes will be replaced by this 
tax, which is an employer paid Net Business Receipts Tax. S-VAT is a 
vehicle for tax benefits, including:

      Health insurance or direct care, including veterans' health care 
for non-
battlefield injuries and long-term care.
      Employer paid educational costs in lieu of taxes are provided as 
either 
employee-directed contributions to the public or private unionized 
school of their choice or direct tuition payments for employee children 
or for workers (including ESL and remedial skills). Wages will be paid 
to students to meet opportunity costs.
      Most importantly, a refundable child tax credit at median income 
levels (with inflation adjustments) distributed with pay.

Subsistence-level benefits force the poor into servile labor. Wages and 
benefits must be high enough to provide justice and human dignity. This 
allows the ending of state administered subsidy programs and 
discourages abortions, and as such enactment must be scored as a must 
pass in voting rankings by pro-life organizations (and feminist 
organizations as well). To assure child subsidies are distributed, S-
VAT will not be border adjustable.

As above, S-VAT surtaxes are collected on all income distributed over 
$75,000, with a beginning rate of 6.25%. replace income tax levies 
collected on the first surtaxes in the same range. Some will use 
corporations to avoid these taxes, but that corporation would then pay 
all invoice and subtraction VAT payments (which would distribute tax 
benefits). Distributions from such corporations will be considered 
salary, not dividends.

Invoice Value-Added Tax (I-VAT). Border adjustable taxes will appear on 
purchase invoices. The rate varies according to what is being financed. 
If Medicare for All does not contain offsets for employers who fund 
their own medical personnel or for personal retirement accounts, both 
of which would otherwise be funded by an S-VAT, then they would be 
funded by the I-VAT to take advantage of border adjustability.

I-VAT forces everyone, from the working poor to the beneficiaries of 
inherited wealth, to pay taxes and share in the cost of government. As 
part of enactment, gross wages will be reduced to take into account the 
shift to S-VAT and I-VAT, however net income will be increased by the 
same percentage as the I-VAT. Inherited assets will be taxed under A-
VAT when sold. Any inherited cash, or funds borrowed against the value 
of shares, will face the I-VAT when sold or the A-VAT if invested.

I-VAT will fund domestic discretionary spending, equal dollar employer 
OASI contributions, and non-nuclear, non-deployed military spending, 
possibly on a regional basis. Regional I-VAT would both require a 
constitutional amendment to change the requirement that all excises be 
national and to discourage unnecessary spending, especially when 
allocated for electoral reasons rather than program needs. The latter 
could also be funded by the asset VAT (decreasing the rate by from 
19.25% to 13%).

Carbon Added Tax (C-AT). A Carbon tax with receipt visibility, which 
allows comparison shopping based on carbon content, even if it means a 
more expensive item with lower carbon is purchased. C-AT would also 
replace fuel taxes. It will fund transportation costs, including mass 
transit, and research into alternative fuels. This tax would not be 
border adjustable unless it is in other nations, however in this case 
the imposition of this tax at the border will be noted, with the U.S. 
tax applied to the overseas base.

Attachment Two--Tax Administration, Treasury Budget, February 12, 2020

Shifting to a single system for all business taxation, particularly 
enacting invoice value-added taxes to collect revenue and employer-
based subtraction value-added taxes to distribute benefits to workers 
will end the need for filing for most, if not all, households. Any 
remaining high salary surtax would be free of any deductions and 
credits and could as easily be collected by enacting higher tiers to a 
subtraction VAT.

Subtraction VAT collection will closely duplicate the collection of 
payroll and income taxes--as well as employment taxes--but without 
households having to file an annual reconciliation except to verify the 
number of dependents receiving benefits.

Tax reform will simplify tax administration on all levels. Firms will 
submit electronic receipts for I-VAT and Carbon Added Tax (C-AT) 
credit, leaving a compliance trail. S-VAT payments to providers, wages 
and child credits to verify that what is paid and what is claimed match 
and that children are not double credited from separate employers.

A-VAT transactions are recorded by brokers, employers for option 
exercise and closing agents for real property. With ADP, reporting 
burdens are equal to those in any VAT system for I-VAT and A-VAT and 
current payroll and income tax reporting by employers.

Employees with children will annually verify information provided by 
employers and IRS, responding by a postcard if reports do not match, 
triggering collection actions. The cliche will thus be made real.

High-salary employees who use corporations to reduce salary surtax and 
pay I-VAT and S-VAT for personal staff. Distributions from such 
corporations to owners are considered salary, not dividends.

Transaction-based A-VAT payments end the complexity and tax avoidance 
experienced with income tax collection. Tax units with income under 
$84,000 or only one employer need not file high salary surtax returns. 
Separate gift and inheritance tax returns will no longer be required.

State governments will collect federal and state I-VAT, C-AT, S-VAT 
payments, audit collection systems, real property A-VAT and conduct 
enforcement actions. IRS collects individual payroll and salary surtax 
payments, performs electronic data matching and receive payments and 
ADP data from states. SEC collects A-VAT receipts.

I-VAT gives all citizens the responsibility to fund the government. C-
AT invoices encourage lower carbon consumption, mass transit, research 
and infrastructure development. A-VAT taxation will slow market 
volatility and encourage employee ownership, while preserving family 
businesses and farms. Very little IRS Administration will be required 
once reform is fully implemented. All IRS employees could fit in a 
bathtub with room for Grover Norquist.

RE: April 19, 2023 Hearing entitled ``The President's Fiscal Year 2024 
IRS Budget and the IRS's 2023 Filing Season''

We congratulate the IRS on taking a fresh perspective on its 
operations. A high-performing IRS will increase tax revenue, 
contributing to balancing the budget while avoiding unduly burdening 
either taxpayers or IRS employees. Countries like Estonia, Finland, and 
Sweden demonstrate that effective processes that simplify and 
facilitate filing build trust with taxpayers and improve compliance, 
which results in a steady and predictable revenue stream.

U.S. persons residing abroad are in particular need of such process 
improvements. Tax filing for non-residents is made difficult by three 
concerns: (1) insufficient information as to filing requirements, (2) 
complex reporting obligations that demand weeks of work to complete and 
a level of expertise that exceeds that of most CPAs, and (3) extremely 
high administrative penalties for any error, omission, or lateness. We 
here explore these concerns by examining three forms that are commonly 
required of non-residents: Forms 3520/3520-A (e.g., for foreign private 
pensions), 8621 (for ``passive foreign investment corporations'' 
(PFICs) also held by the foreign private pensions, or any non-U.S. 
mutual fund), and Form 5471/8992 (for those starting a small business).

Incomplete information:

U.S. persons residing abroad are not adequately informed about what 
they need to do to be in compliance with tax laws. Tax forms and 
related documentation lack clear explanations of laws and IRS 
procedures. For example, Publication 54--described as general guidance 
for non-residents--does not alert non-residents to reporting 
obligations with respect to foreign pensions, passive foreign 
investment companies, or foreign corporations. Form 3520 and 3520-A, 
for example, are information filings for foreign trusts that do not 
imply any tax liability. While most ordinary citizens would not have 
any reason to think that their pensions and investments may be foreign 
trusts, U.S. citizens residing abroad can inadvertently find themselves 
acquiring what the IRS classifies as a foreign trust through a normal-
life activity like investing in a private pension plan where they live. 
Non-residents do not learn about these obligations from the IRS or 
guidance in tax-preparation software, but rather from advocacy groups 
and social media--or an IRS audit. There is no systematic notification 
to U.S. non-residents of these requirements.

For these common reporting types, the instructions available from the 
IRS cannot be understood by a non-expert, and do not allow ordinary 
non-resident taxpayers to know how it might apply to their situation 
and what action they need to take. A non-expert taxpayer who suddenly 
learns from a Facebook group or webinar organized by an organization 
like Democrats Abroad that their private pension may require the filing 
of 3520 and 3520-A and who goes to the IRS website is not able to 
connect the IRS material to their own situation.

U.S. persons residing abroad who understand the requirement to file 
Form 8621 typically decide against investments that might require it 
because of the punitive tax treatment, the extraordinarily heavy 
reporting burden, and the draconian administrative penalties that risk 
resulting from even non-willful errors in such reporting. But, because 
there is no warning in places like Publication 54 of the possible need 
to consider whether a given investment might be classified as a PFIC, 
such individuals often only discover the consequences after investment, 
when it is too late to avoid the 8621 filing requirement. The same 
individual investing in an equivalent pension or mutual fund 
domestically benefits from clear guidance, a functional process, and no 
punitive taxes or disproportionate administrative penalties.

This lack of information is compounded by the difficulties that non-
residents have in reaching the IRS. It is difficult for non-residents 
to set up an online IRS account. Reaching the IRS by telephone--already 
difficult for residents--is even more difficult for non-residents. 
Democrats Abroad regularly receive desperate calls from non-residents 
who have not been able to reach the IRS--or if they reached someone at 
the IRS, that person lacked the expertise to answer their questions 
about these common obligations.

The first Right of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights specifies that 
``Taxpayers have the right to know what they need to do to comply with 
the tax laws. They are entitled to clear explanations of the laws and 
IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, 
and correspondence.''\1\ This Right is denied to non-resident U.S. 
citizens simply because of their place of residence.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://www.irs.gov/taxpayer-bill-of-rights.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excessively burdensome reporting obligations:

The IRS website estimates the filing burden of Forms 3520 and 8621 at 
over 50 hours per form per year. The IRS is not able to estimate the 
filing burden of Forms 5471 and 8992, but it is generally considered to 
take weeks rather than hours. A U.S. citizen who starts a small 
business and looks to save for retirement in a private pension will 
typically find themselves needing to file all of these forms. Suppose 
the pension fund invests in 35 mutual funds. The filing burden is now 
measured in months or tens of thousands of dollars for professional 
support. Not only does this have a devastating effect on the small 
business owner, but it requires considerable processing by the IRS, yet 
it produces little in tax revenue. The key revenue source for these 
filings appears to come from penalties. In a number of cases, such as 
retirement accounts where the PFIC cannot be disposed of, the cost of 
annual ongoing compliance will exceed gross income.

This excessive reporting burden is compounded by the need for the 
taxpayer to make multiple filings. Form 3520 is due in paper form on 
April 15th: It is not filed together with the tax return. The deadline 
is the same as that for the tax return, and it is automatically 
extended with a request for an extension. Form 3520-A, however, is due 
on March 15th. An extension can be requested, but requires a separate 
request from the general extension request. The information on timing 
provided in the IRS instructions is difficult to understand, making 
accidental late filing likely.

The last Right of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights specifies the Right to a 
Fair and Just Tax System: ``Taxpayers have the right to expect the tax 
system to consider facts and circumstances that might affect their 
underlying liabilities, ability to pay, or ability to provide 
information timely.'' For non-residents, there is no mechanism to 
ensure that the reporting burden on individuals is reasonable. The cost 
of the expertise required to complete these forms is high, adding to 
the burden on these ordinary citizens. The IRS seeks to ensure that the 
tax reporting burden for domestic residents stays reasonable. This care 
and attention do not exist for non-residents. Note that the reporting 
requirements described here come from efforts to identify assets held 
by ultra-wealthy citizens who hold foreign bank accounts, most of whom 
are U.S. residents. The ultra wealthy are able to use their resources 
to hire expert advisors and navigate the system. Wealth is also needed 
to pay the $5,000-$15,000 that is required to apply for regulatory 
relief. The millions of non-residents of modest income are left on 
their own, with no protection from being crushed by this burden.

Excessive penalties:

The IRS has increasingly adopted a penalty-as-revenue model over recent 
years due to the difficulties of collecting taxes from the ultra-
wealthy, most of whom are U.S. residents. Penalties of $10,000 and more 
can easily be assessed against ordinary non-residents who don't realize 
that they have reporting requirements for ordinary actions that would 
not entail reporting requirements were they U.S. residents. Draconian 
penalties for errors easily wipe out a lifetime of savings for an 
individual or small business, and this occurs solely because that 
individual or small-business owner happens to live abroad.

Here we will add FinCEN's FBAR to the set of forms that we have 
considered so far. Failure to file the FBAR because of not knowing that 
it is required (recalling that there has been no systematic 
notification of the obligation to file to the large number of U.S. 
persons living abroad, many of whom do not even have a U.S. passport or 
social security number due to being a dual citizen born abroad to a 
U.S. parent) incurs penalties of up to $10,000 per year even when it is 
clear that the person involved was not aware of the obligation to file. 
The April 7, 2022 report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax 
Administration \2\ described a potential penalty gap of $3.3 billion 
for the 330,082 potential non-filers of Form 8938 identified by the 
system for taxpayers with a TIN, calling for action to improve 
collection of these penalties. U.S. persons living outside of the U.S. 
are at risk of non-compliance because understanding FATCA and FBAR is 
objectively hard (recalling that the U.S. no longer offers any tax help 
to those living outside of the U.S. aside from an international phone 
line--and those who are confused by FBAR and FATCA are typically those 
who are least equipped to place such a call). It is important to note 
that this $3.3 billion does not represent a tax liability, but a 
penalty for those caught in a trap because they lacked the wealth and 
sophistication to understand this complex filing requirement.

202230019fr.pdf, Highlights.

A recent article by Hale Sheppard \3\ describes the ``decision tree'' 
instructions that IRS auditors are given to decide whether to abate the 
penalty that had been automatically assessed when Form 5471 was filed 
late or is otherwise counted as incomplete. Auditors are informed that 
being unaware of the filing requirements, financial problems short of 
bankruptcy, complicated transactions/laws/business structure, or delays 
due to difficulties in obtaining foreign information or multiple layers 
of ownership do not count as reasonable cause: They are told to deny 
abatement requests that give these reasons. Completing the form 
requires the use of GAAP and the conversion of all financial 
information into USD, creating a major reporting burden that goes 
beyond the capacity of any ordinary taxpayer. That the conversion to 
GAAP and USD would cause excessive cost to the taxpayer was taken by 
the IRS to not warrant a penalty abatement.\4\ These requirements do 
not apply to the taxpayer living in the U.S. who starts a similar small 
business.

We request the following process improvements from the IRS to protect 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
U.S. persons residing abroad:

     1.  Commit to making filing processes for non-resident individuals 
reasonable and consistent with the filing burden for residents;
     2.  Update materials such as Publication 54 to advise non-
residents of their filing obligations and provide detailed guidance on 
the steps that an ordinary taxpayer needs to take to be in compliance;
     3.  Publish clear information about how common retirement account 
types for each country are regarded with regards to tax treaties and 
obligations to file forms 3520, 3520A, and 8621 for the account or its 
contents;
     4.  Terminate the use of penalties aimed at non-residents to 
compensate for the failure to collect ordinary domestic tax liabilities 
from wealthy individuals residing in the U.S.;
     5.  Collect and publish data about the use of penalties to ensure 
that they are not used to target weaker individuals who have fewer 
resources to defend themselves;
     6.  Reduce the penalties to a level that is commensurate with the 
tax liability and proportional to any alleged violation;
     7.  Adjust penalties for the context, such that ordinary taxpayers 
are not charged penalties designed to punish those who are ultra-
wealthy;
     8.  Remove information reporting requirements that do not add 
value such as FBAR;
     9.  Urgently take action to mitigate the harm that U.S. citizens 
abroad face in opening bank accounts, saving for pensions, or having 
access to other financial services as an unintended consequence of 
measures taken relative to the ultra wealthy. Once an individual has 
around $500,000 in liquid assets, the difficulties of the 
extraterritorial tax code are greatly reduced--the ultra-wealthy are 
not harmed by the annual cost of compliance and face no problems with 
denials of accounts, while ordinary U.S. citizens are unable to obtain 
necessary financial services because they lack the financial resources 
necessary to justify their compliance risk and burden to banks.
    10.  Continue to improve access to help from the IRS, including 
help with issues specific to U.S. persons that reside abroad;
    11.  Publish information about the decision processes and standard 
operating procedures used by the IRS in audits. These decision 
processes and standard operating procedures should be overseen by 
Congress to ensure due process and equal treatment of all U.S. 
citizens.

The United States imposes unique, burdensome, and ruinous tax 
obligations and penalties on its overseas citizens, yet its efforts to 
inform citizens are limited to a footnote on page 52 of passports that 
refers to IRS Publication 54. The use of complex procedures and lack of 
information and guidance to entrap ordinary U.S. non-residents who 
legally owe little in taxes to the U.S. so that they can be charged 
large administrative penalties goes against every principle of fairness 
and justice.

In Section 611 of Public Law 95-426, Congress began by affirming that 
U.S. citizens living abroad should be provided fair and equitable 
treatment by the U.S. Government with respect to taxation and other 
areas, and that U.S. statutes and regulations should be designed so as 
not to create competitive disadvantage for individual American citizens 
living abroad. No one disagrees with this affirmation, which aligns 
with Constitutional protection of equal rights for U.S. citizens who 
are non-resident. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights applies to non-residents 
as well as residents.

A first step is improving the process to ensure that filing 
requirements for these ordinary U.S. citizens are reasonable, clearly 
and systematically communicated to those with potential filing 
obligations, and freed from unreasonable penalties.

Our belief in effective, administrable, and progressive taxation is 
what motivates the support of Democrats Abroad for Residency Based 
Taxation.

Force with any questions about the information and recommendations 
provided here.

          Statement of Anthony M. Reardon, National President

    Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and distinguished members of 
the Committee, I would like to thank you for allowing me to provide 
comments on the IRS budget request for FY 2024. As President of the 
National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), I have the honor of 
representing over 150,000 federal workers in 34 agencies and 
departments, including the men and women at the IRS.

    Mr. Chairman, NTEU strongly supports the Administration's FY 2024 
budget request of $14.1 billion for the IRS, an increase of more than 
$1.8 billion above the current level. We are particularly pleased the 
Administration's request would provide the IRS with the resources 
necessary to maintain recent improvements in customer service and 
continue rebuilding its depleted workforce which is down by more than 
15,000 since FY 2010.

                           Taxpayer Services

    Providing quality customer service to the taxpayer is an important 
part of IRS efforts to help the taxpaying public understand their tax 
obligations while making it easier to comply. Unfortunately, the IRS' 
ability to provide excellent taxpayer service has been severely 
challenged due to reduced funding in recent years. Without additional 
resources, recent gains in customer service will be reversed, 
jeopardizing our voluntary compliance system.

         Impact of Funding Reductions on IRS Taxpayer Services

    Mr. Chairman, funding reductions in recent years have had a 
devastating impact on IRS' ability to provide taxpayers, including 
victims of identity theft, with the service they need in a timely 
manner. Since FY 2010, the IRS customer service workforce has shrunk by 
over 40 percent. In particular, the reduction of Customer Service 
Representatives (CSRs) and other employees assigned to answer taxpayer 
inquiries in recent years led to a rapid decline in the phone level of 
service (LOS). In 2010, there were 21,057 CSRs--11 years later, the 
number was down to 15,482. The drastic decline in CSRs resulted in just 
21 percent of taxpayer calls being answered during FY 2021, down from 
74 percent in FY 2010. In addition, wait times to speak to IRS 
representatives more than doubled to 21 minutes on average.

    In addition, as a result of budget cuts, the IRS was forced to 
reduce the number of Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) located around 
the country from 401 to 362, reduce hours of operation, and move to 
appointment-only. Taxpayers are able to visit the TACs when they have 
complex tax issues, need to resolve tax problems relating to their tax 
accounts, have questions about how the tax law applies to their 
individual income tax returns, or feel more comfortable talking with 
someone in person.

    The importance of providing taxpayers with timely assistance over 
the phone or in person is of particular importance for victims of 
identity theft and other types of tax refund fraud. These cases are 
extremely complex cases to resolve, frequently touching on multiple 
issues and multiple tax years and the process of resolving these cases 
can be very frustrating for victims.

    While the IRS has made considerable progress in this area, 
additional work remains. Fighting identity theft is an ongoing battle 
as identity thieves continue to create new ways of stealing personal 
information and using it for their gain. Therefore, it is critical that 
the IRS has the resources and staffing necessary to prevent refund 
fraud from occurring in the first place, investigate identity theft-
related crimes when they do occur and help taxpayers who have been 
victimized by identity thieves as quickly as possible.

    That is why NTEU strongly supports the President's request of $3.4 
billion in funding for taxpayer services in FY 2024. This additional 
funding will enable the IRS to increase overall staffing for taxpayer 
services by more than 4,700 FTEs, including an additional 3,450 FTEs to 
improve the telephone level of service to 80 percent for the fiscal 
year and drastically reduce the correspondence inventory.

    Mr. Chairman, it is evident that funding reductions in recent years 
have seriously eroded the IRS' ability to provide taxpayers with the 
services they need. Without stable funding, taxpayers will continue to 
experience a degradation of services, recent progress in providing 
taxpayers with timely assistance on the phone will be reversed, and 
correspondence inventories, including letters from victims of identity 
theft and taxpayers seeking to resolve issues with taxes due or looking 
to set up payment plans, will increase.

                              Enforcement

    Mr. Chairman, NTEU believes a strong enforcement program that 
respects taxpayer rights, and minimizes taxpayer burden, plays a 
critical role in IRS' efforts to enhance voluntary compliance, combat 
the rising incidence of identity theft and reduce the tax gap.

  Impact on Funding Reduction on Efforts to Reduce the Federal Deficit

    Unfortunately, funding reductions in recent years has also 
undermined the Service's ability to maximize taxpayer compliance and 
generate critical revenue that can be used to reduce the federal 
deficit or pay for critical services.

    Since FY 2010 overall enforcement staffing has been reduced by 30 
percent, including IRS revenue officers (ROs) and revenue agents (RAs) 
who are critical to ensuring the integrity of the tax code and reducing 
the tax gap. According to the IRS the number of RAs who handle complex 
enforcement cases, fell by 41 percent, while ROs, who manage difficult 
collections cases, dropped by 52 percent.

    The loss of so many highly trained enforcement staff has led to 
drastic declines in audit coverage for wealthy individuals and large 
corporations. In particular, the audit rate for millionaires is down 
roughly 75 percent in the last decade, while audits of corporations 
with more than $20 billion in assets are down almost 50 percent, which 
increases the risk to the integrity of the nation's voluntary tax 
compliance system.

    Sufficient enforcement staffing is also critical if the IRS is to 
make further progress on closing the tax gap which former Commissioner 
Rettig believes could total $1 trillion this year, and an estimated 
$7.5 trillion over the next decade. And as previous IRS Commissioners 
have repeatedly noted, a simple one-percent decline in the compliance 
rate translates into $30 billion in lost revenue for the government.

    While the tax gap can never be completely eliminated, even an 
incremental reduction in the amount of unpaid taxes would provide 
critical resources for the federal government. At a time when Congress 
is debating painful choices of program cuts and tax increases to 
address the federal budget deficit, NTEU believes it makes sense to 
invest in one of the most effective deficit reduction tools: collecting 
revenue that is owed but hasn't yet been paid.

    That is why NTEU was happy to see the Administration's budget 
request would provide an increase of more than $466 million for tax 
enforcement above the current level, ensuring IRS has the ability to 
maximize taxpayer compliance and close the tax gap. This includes 
dedicated funding to hire additional specialized examination personnel 
that will help facilitate optimal oversight of high income, large 
corporate, and large partnership tax returns.

          Impact of Limiting FY 2024 Funding to FY 2022 Levels

    Mr. Chairman, I would be remiss if I did not mention NTEU's concern 
with Congressional Republicans' proposals to cap overall FY 2024 
discretionary funding at the FY 2022 enacted level. Such a plan would 
force the IRS to divert funding provided in the IRA to simply maintain 
current levels of operation and would undermine its' ability to meet 
its long-term plans to improve customer service, modernize its aging 
technology and building up its enforcement capacity.

    In particular, the IRS has warned that if it does not receive 
funding for FY 2024 at the level requested by the President, it will be 
forced to use 100 percent of IRA taxpayer service funds to ensure it is 
able to provide acceptable levels of phone and walk-in assistance, and 
that these funds would be fully exhausted in less than four years.

    Failing to fund the IRS at the FY 2024 requested level would also 
prevent IRS from meeting its long-term IT modernization project goals. 
Funding for BSM was zeroed out in the FY 2023 Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, and because current funding for operations support 
is insufficient to cover normal IT operations costs, the IRS would be 
forced to delay or withdraw approximately one-third of the planned 
modernization.

                  The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022

    Last August Congress approved the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 
2022 which included more than $79 billion in funding over the next 
decade for the IRS to improve taxpayer services, modernize its outdated 
technological infrastructure, and restore IRS' capacity to ensure tax 
compliance among high-income individuals, complex partnerships, and 
large corporations.

    Taxpayers are already seeing the benefits of this historic 
investment in the form of improved service during the current filing 
season. With funding provided by the IRA, the IRS was able to hire an 
additional 5,000 CSRs to answer taxpayer calls and process 
correspondence in advance of the filing season. These additional hires 
have helped IRS achieve a live assistance level of service of 87 
percent, up from around 15 percent during the previous filing season, 
while the wait time to speak to an IRS employee has been reduced to 
about four minutes, compared with 27 minutes a year ago.

    The IRS plans to hire another 5,300 CSRs by the end of 2023, and 
coupled with funding requested for FY 2024, the IRS projects it will 
achieve an 85 percent level of service for the current filing season, 
and an 80 percent level of service for FY 2024.

    Funding from the IRA has also allowed the IRS to reopen more 
Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) around the country where taxpayers 
can meet face-to-face with an agency professional to get answers to 
their questions. As of early April, 335 of the IRS 362 TACs were open, 
with 27 closed or not staffed. That compares with August 2022, when the 
IRS had 317 TACs open out of a total of 359, with 42 closed or not 
staffed.

    Prior to passage of the IRA, the IRS lacked the resources to 
modernize its outdated IT infrastructure hampering efforts to better 
service taxpayers in this digital age. This inability to plan for 
stable IT funding led to a ``start and stop approach'' to modernization 
that did not allow for sustained progress. But with funding provided in 
the IRA, the IRS will finally be able to advance significant technology 
modernization initiatives that directly benefit taxpayers. These 
initiatives will greatly improve the taxpayer experience and include 
more options for digital communications, secure document exchange, 
expanded payment options, digital signature authorizations and an 
automated callback program, all of which will allow our customer 
service staff to provide more comprehensive service to taxpayers.

    NTEU strongly supports the Strategic Operating Plan released by the 
IRS proposes to use the IRA funding to rebuild and modernize the agency 
by providing the necessary staffing to deliver services to taxpayers, 
technology to make compliance with the tax laws easier and expand 
enforcement efforts for large corporations and partnerships and for 
high wealth individuals with complex returns. The plan recognizes that 
as our nation grows and the tax system is increasingly complex the IRS 
requires appropriate funding, staffing and technology to meet its 
mission.

    NTEU strongly supported the influx of funding provided by the IRA 
and encourages Congress to continue providing proper annual 
appropriations. As the IRS notes, its employees are its greatest asset, 
and the plan rightly focuses on the importance of a workforce that has 
the tools and resources it needs to deliver for American taxpayers. 
That includes increased staffing, proper training, modern technology, 
and systems.

                               CONCLUSION

    Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to provide NTEU's views 
on the Administration's FY 2024 budget request for the IRS. NTEU 
believes that only by providing stable funding for effective 
enforcement and taxpayer service programs can the IRS provide America's 
taxpayers with quality service while maximizing revenue collection that 
is critical to reducing the federal deficit.
