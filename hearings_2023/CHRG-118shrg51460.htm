                              ----------                              


                      THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
                 Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:07 a.m. in 
Room SD-366, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Joe Manchin 
III, Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

    The Chairman. The Committee will come to order.
    On February 24, 2022, nearly one year ago, Putin launched 
an unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This war has 
taken precious human lives and has had immediate international 
consequences that will be felt for decades. Food, energy, and 
shipping prices have all increased, making it difficult for 
families all over the world to meet their most basic needs. We 
are here today to reflect on how we got here and what the 
impact has been on global energy security, and discuss our 
pathway forward. Putin has played the long game in weaponizing 
Russia's abundant energy resources in the region by getting 
Europe hooked on their cheap gas and energy. And more recently, 
in an effort to weaken the national resolve, Russia is 
targeting and systematically destroying Ukraine's water and 
energy infrastructure, leaving millions without power, water, 
or heat during the coldest winter months.
    The U.S., the EU, and our other allies are working together 
to support Ukraine and have enacted various sanctions targeting 
Russian entities, trade, and specific economic sectors. On 
energy, the U.S. has led the free world's response. We have 
more than doubled LNG shipments to Europe, exported record 
levels of crude oil, and have grown our coal and refined 
product exports to meet the demand and break the chokehold 
Putin has on Europe. We have worked with the EU and the rest of 
the G7 to set price caps on Russian oil exports, which has 
helped to reduce Putin's oil revenue by more than one-third. We 
are also responding by working with the Ukrainian Ministry of 
Energy to ship emergency electricity equipment for Ukrainian 
grid repairs, led by the Department of Energy. The Department 
continues coordinating with public-private entities to deliver 
critical resources to Europe and Ukraine. I look forward to 
learning more about these efforts from Dr. Light, who is with 
us today.
    Approximately one quarter of Europe's energy is generated 
from natural gas, and prior to the war, Russia supplied the 
bulk of that energy. Throughout 2022, Russia began decreasing 
natural gas supplies to Europe, but still supplied roughly 15 
percent of the EU's natural gas consumption in 2022, but that 
is down from 40 percent the prior year. As shown on the chart 
behind me, within six months of Putin's invasion, the U.S. sent 
more natural gas to Europe via ship than Russia sent by 
pipeline.
    [The chart referred to follows:]

    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    The Chairman. That was an incredible feat that no one would 
have thought possible only one year ago. But as the chart also 
shows, we still have a long way to go to replace the Russian 
energy which Europe has relied on. In 2023, the EU is facing a 
supply shortfall roughly equivalent to what Russia supplied in 
2022--approximately 2 trillion cubic feet. The EU has been 
remarkably successful in diversifying its natural gas supplies, 
but the shortfall means the EU must continue to arrange for 
increased LNG imports, build out infrastructure, and also look 
to other generation technologies to fill that gap. I was 
encouraged to hear that this week European Commission officials 
met with representatives from our natural gas industries to 
discuss additional export agreements.
    Director-General Jorgensen, we look forward to hearing from 
you about Europe's progress in moving off Russian energy and 
how our energy industries can continue to help. Now, I think it 
is important to point out that we, the United States, are not 
currently immune to the threat of resource weaponization. At 
the beginning of the war, we were importing 500,000 barrels of 
Russian oil daily, despite having huge oil and gas resources 
domestically, and our Canadian friends to the north were happy 
to send us even more. I am proud that immediately following 
Putin's invasion last year, members of this Committee acted 
quickly, on a bipartisan basis, to introduce legislation to ban 
U.S. imports of Russian energy. President Biden followed our 
lead and implemented the ban, but still, we are reliant on 
Russia for the uranium needed for our zero-emission baseload 
nuclear fleet and advanced nuclear reactors of the future. That 
is why Senators Barrasso, Risch, and I are introducing bills to 
cut our reliance on Russian nuclear fuel while reestablishing 
our uranium conversion and enrichment capacity to meet our 
domestic nuclear fuel needs. As the superpower of the world, we 
must evaluate our supply chains and ensure that we are not 
beholden to countries that do not share our values, lest we 
fall victim to the same weaponization that we have seen play 
out over the last year.
    The fact is, business leaders and policymakers on both 
sides of the Atlantic have an opportunity to do much more to 
help Ukraine, our European allies, and ourselves. Energy 
companies and shareholders must prioritize energy security, 
which may mean focusing on growing production before near-term 
profits. But that also goes for the Federal Government, which 
must start balancing lofty climate goals with geopolitical 
needs if we are going to remain a superpower of the world while 
also making progress on decarbonization. You see, my view of 
decarbonization includes displacing dirtier fuels sourced from 
around the world, whether that be dirty environmentally or 
politically, and we have the abundant natural resources right 
here to do it. Let's be honest, increased energy imports from 
the U.S. mean a cleaner fuel for our European friends. Russia 
emits 38 percent more methane and more than three times as much 
carbon dioxide from flaring per barrel of oil production than 
we do in the U.S.
    To that end, industry also needs the Federal Government to 
signal with both words and actions that we will support the 
responsible development of all types of energy here in the 
United States. This means timely, predictable energy permitting 
and an end to the regulatory assault on fossil fuels, which we 
can produce and use cleaner than anywhere else. Our country 
continues to need fossil fuels, and our allies are desperate 
for greater access to our resources. As of today, the war shows 
no sign of coming to a peaceful resolution. The U.S and our 
allies must continue to work in concert to respond and prepare 
for the coming challenges while we continue to seek an end to 
these hostilities. The U.S. has a responsibility and 
opportunity to support our friends and allies. We must not 
allow Russia to dictate the economic and security terms of 
post-war Europe. That is why Senator Murkowski and I just 
introduced a bill that would enhance the ability of the 
Secretary of Energy to establish international partnerships to 
secure our supply chains while reducing our allies' reliance on 
Russian energy resources. We must create a future of energy 
independence and security from any undemocratic regime seeking 
to weaponize energy to win a war.
    I appreciate our witnesses joining us today to discuss the 
important issues, and look forward to the discussion. With 
that, I will turn it over to Senator Barrasso for his opening 
remarks.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING

    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks so much, Mr. Chairman and 
thanks for your incredible remarks as we open this Committee 
hearing today. I want to thank you for holding the hearing. I 
want to thank you for your opening statement. And as we know, 
Europe has learned some very hard lessons following Russia's 
invasion of Ukraine. None are clearer than the need to have 
access to an affordable and dependable supply of energy. 
Unfortunately, President Biden has not learned a thing from 
Putin's war of aggression and the energy crisis in Europe. 
Europeans understand the crucial importance of increasing U.S. 
oil and natural gas production and exports. The President still 
does not.
    A week after Russia's invasion began, President Biden 
delivered his 2022 State of the Union Address. With Russia 
rampaging through Ukraine, energy prices in Europe skyrocketed. 
President Biden did not say a word about increasing American 
energy production, and he should have. Just last week, at this 
year's speech, the President again refused to support any 
policies that would increase American energy production. He 
would rather increase energy taxes than increase U.S. energy 
production. It does not seem to matter to him about the cost, 
he is focused solely on the climate. The President also seems 
to believe that we can stop producing oil and gas in just ten 
years. That is a dangerous fantasy. No wonder oil and gas 
companies are thinking twice before investing in American 
energy. The reality is that the world still runs on oil, 
natural gas, and coal. It will do so for the foreseeable 
future, even as we reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Killing 
American production is not going to change that. It will just 
enrich our adversaries and leave America and our allies weaker 
and less secure.
    The President has also doubled down on his zealous approach 
to climate. His focus on climate change above all else is 
hurting American families, and it is harming our national 
security and our national competitiveness. Look at the damage 
that Europe's climate policies have inflicted so far. They 
brought the continent some of the highest energy prices in the 
world and they increased the continent's dependence on Russian 
energy. Many in Europe have had to turn to wood, to peat, and 
to garbage to heat their homes. But for President Biden, 
Europe's energy policy is a model. He believes that he can 
impose the same goals and policies here and somehow get 
different results. But following Europe's example means living 
with Europe's results. Europe's energy policy is a warning, not 
a model. What has not worked in Europe will not work here. 
Europe's experience should also teach us the folly of depending 
on tyrannical regimes for energy.
    Thanks to the shale revolution, the United States no longer 
needs to depend on cartels and rogue nations for our energy. It 
took us decades to achieve that. But the President's assault on 
American energy production will surrender this vital economic 
and geopolitical advantage. His unrealistic renewable and 
electric vehicle goals will also make us much more dependent on 
our adversaries, like China and Russia, for critical minerals 
and materials. The President's goals would require massive 
amounts of copper, cobalt, nickel, lithium, graphite, and many 
other minerals. China and Russia control the supply chains of 
many of these minerals. We need more American production, but 
it is almost impossible to get a permit for a new mine in the 
United States. In fact, the Biden Administration recently 
killed two U.S. copper mines. President Biden would prefer that 
we import these minerals, even sending money to our enemies.
    It is a disgrace that we do not have the capability to fuel 
our own nuclear reactors. You mentioned it, Mr. Chairman. 
Ensuring a secure supply of American uranium for existing and 
advanced reactors is a top priority of mine. Yesterday, our 
Chairman, Senator Manchin, as well as Senator Risch and I, 
introduced legislation to do just that. We also plan to 
introduce a bill to ban Russian uranium imports. We cannot 
allow President Biden to throw away America's hard-won energy 
independence and increase our reliance on China and Russia. 
Europe's plight makes it abundantly clear that this would be a 
colossal mistake.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Barrasso.
    I would like to turn to our witnesses, and we will begin 
with Assistant Secretary, Dr. Andrew Light.
    He will be followed by Director-General for Energy of the 
European Commission, Ms. Ditte Juul Jorgensen.
    And finally, a Fellow in Energy Studies at Rice University, 
Dr. Anna Mikulska.
    I want thank you all for joining us, especially Director-
General Jorgensen, for traveling so far, and you know, maybe 
the jet lag, you will be able to turn it around so quickly, it 
will not affect you.
    [Laughter.]
    The Chairman. But I do appreciate the effort you have made 
to be here, and it is a pleasure.
    Assistant Secretary Light, we are going begin with your 
opening remarks, sir.


STATEMENT OF HON. ANDREW E. LIGHT, ASSISTANT SECRETARY, OFFICE 
      OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

    Dr. Light. Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member Barrasso, and 
members of the Committee, it is an honor to appear before you 
today to discuss energy security in Europe and the role of the 
U.S. Department of Energy in supporting Ukraine.
    Nearly one year ago today, Putin's Russia brutally, 
illegally, and immorally began its full-scale invasion of 
Ukraine. Even before Russia attacked with tanks and troops, it 
had already used energy as a weapon to terrorize the Ukrainian 
people, actions which were quickly expanded to Europe and the 
rest of the world. Let me be clear: Russia's use of energy as a 
weapon has backfired. It has spurred an international response 
unprecedented in the history of global energy cooperation, and 
the United States has been a leader in that response. 
Nonetheless, the current status of the energy system in Ukraine 
is dire. Over the last four months, an estimated 700 Russian 
missiles have hit energy facilities throughout the country. The 
Ukrainian grid operator is using rolling blackouts to meet 
about 75 percent of normal customer demand, sometimes losing up 
to 50 percent of generation. Make no mistake, Russia's attacks 
on Ukraine's grid are brutalizing the civilian population.
    The U.S. Department of Energy has a special relationship 
with our Ukrainian counterparts across a range of issues. 
Secretary Granholm led the U.S. Presidential delegation to Kyiv 
in August 2021 to attend the ceremonies marking the 30th 
anniversary of independence, and our relationship has been very 
close since then. This relationship enabled the Department to 
deliver indispensable assistance quickly after Russia's further 
invasion of Ukraine.
    Before the war, Congress appropriated my office $30 million 
to assist Ukraine in creating a permanent interconnection with 
the European energy grid and eventual capacity to export 
electricity to neighboring countries. Following Russia's 
attacks on Ukraine's grid, DOE began delivering some $15 
million worth of critical energy infrastructure equipment, 
starting last December, primarily from surplus supplies in the 
U.S. By early March, we will deliver the third tranche of this 
equipment. DOE is also monitoring Ukraine's nuclear power 
infrastructure and working closely with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency to ensure proper safeguards remain in 
place. And finally, DOE and our national labs are working to 
help Ukraine build a secure, resilient, independent, and 
adaptable energy system. We have invested $10 million in our 
national labs to help plan Ukraine's future energy system, post 
reconstruction.
    It is clear to us that energy security and the energy 
transition are two sides of the same coin. There can be no 
lasting energy security without diversifying energy supply, 
including expanding the use of clean energy. Recognizing the 
danger posed by Russia's unitary position in the European 
energy market, the President took decisive action and directed 
the Administration to take all available measures to work with 
our allies in Europe and around the world to ensure a surge of 
LNG and pipeline gas was available for Europe, as the Chairman 
indicated earlier. Last year, some two-thirds of U.S. LNG 
shipments went to Europe, more than doubling the volumes 
exported to Europe in 2021. President Biden also launched the 
U.S.-EU Task Force on Energy Security with President von der 
Leyen to help the EU reduce overall demand for natural gas and 
to more quickly decarbonize. And just yesterday, Secretary 
Granholm co-chaired a meeting on the current natural gas crisis 
in Europe with over 40 countries through the International 
Energy Agency to prepare options to help ensure European and 
global natural gas security, consistent with net-zero 
transitions through the 2023-2024 winter. Make no mistake, next 
winter will almost certainly be harder with China ramping back 
to pre-COVID consumption levels and no Russian gas for European 
storage.
    Over the past year, the United States has also led 
coordinated efforts to ensure a secure supply of oil to the 
global market by working with partners and allies on a 
coordinated release of 270 million barrels of oil from 
strategic reserves around the world. We have also worked to 
limit Russia's profits from oil sales through our efforts with 
G7 partners, the EU, and Australia on a price cap on Russian 
crude oil and now on refined products.
    However, energy security is not only about oil and gas, and 
is not only about Russia. Overreliance on a single supplier, 
any supplier, leaves the United States and the rest of the 
world vulnerable to other countries. China currently produces 
about 75 percent of all lithium-ion batteries and controls most 
of the midstream capacity for battery supply chains, as well. 
Congress has recognized this vulnerability and provided the 
tools to counter it through the historic investments in the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and IRA. DOE's work on 
diversifying energy supply, stabilizing energy markets, 
ensuring secure supply chains, and accelerating the energy 
transition, benefit all of our partners and allies around the 
globe and will also create hundreds of thousands of good-
paying, clean energy jobs here at home.
    With continued perseverance, we will win this energy 
conflict and come out more secure than before. I look forward 
to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Light follows:]

    The Chairman. Thank you so much. I appreciate it, Dr. 
Light.
    And now, first of all, I would like to introduce some of 
the dignitaries we have with us. We want to thank the EU 
Ambassador Lambrinidis for being here with us, and also the 
Head of Global Issues for the EU, Ms. Perez. I want to thank 
you all. We appreciate it very much.
    And also, again, Director, we are so happy that you made 
this effort and we would like to hear from you now.

STATEMENT OF DITTE JUUL JORGENSEN, DIRECTOR-GENERAL FOR ENERGY, 
                      EUROPEAN COMMISSION

    Ms. Jorgensen. Thank you, Honorable Chairman Manchin, 
Ranking Member Barrasso, members of the Committee, fellow 
speakers Anna and Andrew, thank you very much for the 
invitation, and to you, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership in 
the Senate response to the global energy crisis.
    Today I want to focus on three messages. First, one year 
into the Russian war on the European continent, the crisis is 
not over, but the European Union's response has been immediate, 
strong, and effective. We have managed to combine energy 
security with the objectives of clean energy transition and 
climate neutrality. Within weeks of Russia's invasion into 
Ukraine, the European Commission proposed the REPowerEU plan, 
which aims to reduce our dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 
reducing our overall consumption by more and faster renewable 
energy and by replacing Russian energy sources with supplies 
from reliable partners. Quickly replacing Russian natural gas 
was, of course, key. The transatlantic alliance has been 
essential in this regard, and I would like to thank you for 
that. Imports of U.S. LNG almost tripled in 2022, and the 
United States is now the biggest LNG exporter to the European 
Union.
    The EU also lowered its consumption and increased the share 
of renewable energy. In just a few months, we reduced our gas 
demand by 20 percent. We filled our gas storage facilities 
ahead of winter from a historically low level. We upgraded our 
infrastructure to ensure gas from alternative sources. We 
created an EU energy platform that can aggregate demand and 
jointly purchase gas. We reduced our peak electricity demand. 
We accelerated permitting for renewable energy. And we have 
significantly increased installed capacity of renewables. 
Russian natural gas supply to the European Union is now less 
than half of what it used to be and we are working under the 
assumption--we have prepared for that scenario that there would 
be zero natural gas imports from Russia next winter.
    My second message today is that we have supported our 
neighbors in Ukraine, but also in Moldova, who suffer from the 
war. We provided economic and technical support to Ukraine. We 
synchronized our electricity grid so as to make their system 
independent from the Russian electricity system. And we have 
provided both Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova candidate 
status to join the European Union. In total, the European Union 
and member states have provided more than =50 billion--$73 
billion--so far in financial, military, humanitarian, and 
refugee assistance of support to Ukraine. We have sent more 
than 5,000 generators to Ukraine and we will continue to 
provide aid and assistance to the Ukrainian people. We have 
also demonstrated our solidarity and support for Ukraine by 
swiftly imposing unprecedented sanctions. We have adopted nine 
sanctions packages, and just yesterday proposed a tenth 
sanctions package.
    My third and final message is on our very strong 
transatlantic cooperation. The United States has been a 
reliable ally in supplying energy, particularly LNG, and in the 
global clean energy transition, supporting us in this crisis. 
We have had a close cooperation with the Administration, and 
the fight against climate change is, indeed, a shared 
responsibility, as is the response to the energy crisis. With 
our European Green Deal, we have shown global climate 
leadership. We enshrined climate neutrality by 2050 into law 
and we are transforming our energy system to achieve that 
objective. We in the European Union see natural gas as an 
important energy source for the transition. We count on further 
engaging with the United States, including as regards the 
supply of LNG, the exports of LNG, to reduce methane emissions, 
to spur investments into renewables and into hydrogen, to roll 
out heat pumps, to make sure that the transition is just and 
fair, working together for access to critical raw materials and 
reliable supply chains, while of course ensuring that global 
markets also in energy and related products are fair and open 
for both sides.
    In summary, the European Union has shown unity and 
determination in handling this crisis. We have also shown that 
energy security and the transition toward climate-neutral 
energy systems are aligned and mutually reinforcing. But above 
all else, peace on our continent and Ukraine's reconstruction 
are our highest immediate priorities, and we look forward to 
continuing the partnership with the United States toward that. 
I look forward to your questions. Thank you.

    The Chairman. Thank you so much, Ms. Jorgensen.
    And finally, we have Dr. Mikulska from Rice, thank you.

STATEMENT OF DR. ANNA MIKULSKA, FELLOW IN ENERGY STUDIES, BAKER 
          INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY, RICE UNIVERSITY

    Dr. Mikulska. Chairman Manchin, Senator Barrasso, and the 
Committee, thank you very much for inviting me here to share my 
expertise.
    The Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought back the issue 
of energy security to energy policy in the EU in a way that 
probably could only be compared with the 1970s oil shocks. At 
that time, Western European nations decided that reliance on 
crude oil would be attenuated by bringing in Russian natural 
gas to support European energy and European industry and 
heating needs. Now, half a century later, the EU is facing 
another energy crisis that results from mismanagement of energy 
security, including overreliance on Russian energy, 
underestimation of Russia's readiness to use gas flows for 
geopolitical purposes, and a general lack of alternatives for 
immediate and seamless substitution. As a result, for almost a 
year now, Europe has relied on energy efficiency measures, 
demand curtailment, and ability to pay record prices for 
energy.
    Also critical has been support from the U.S. oil and gas 
industry, which turned out record volumes, helping to sustain 
anti-Russian efforts around the world with flexible and 
commercially oriented supply and active energy diplomacy that 
U.S. status as an energy exporter has made possible. While 
these measures prevented a complete breakdown of Europe's 
energy system, they do point to the fact that Europe failed to 
ensure its energy security, as defined by availability, 
accessibility, affordability, and acceptability of supply. The 
mismanagement of the energy security dimension of energy policy 
has been especially stark for natural gas, where immediate and 
full replacement of lost ration volumes has not been possible 
due to insufficient infrastructure that would allow access to 
globally traded liquefied natural gas. Recent infrastructure 
additions, especially floating storage regasification units 
being installed hastily and at a great cost in Germany, the 
Netherlands, and Italy may help, but only to an extent, given 
that global supply of LNG will not expand much over the next 
two to three years. There is also the potential for rebounding 
Chinese demand that could tighten the markets even further.
    Europe will need to continue competing for supply with 
added LNG-importing countries. And while wealthy European 
countries are likely to outbid others, as they did last year, 
this will impact the affordability of their energy supply. Last 
fall, wholesale prices of natural gas in Europe peaked to $90 
per million BTU, which is compared to the average of $6 to $10 
from before the invasion and about $6 in the U.S. at the peak 
of gas prices last year. Similarly, prices of electricity and 
coal, used to substitute for natural gas, have risen to record 
highs, and even though prices have abated, right now, they are 
still at multiples of what they were before. High energy prices 
have dealt a blow to European industry, including most 
prominently the chemical and fertilizer industries. The 
prospect of high energy prices in the short- to medium-term 
also creates concerns about potential de-industrialization as 
companies consider options to re-shore to countries where the 
costs of energy are lower and less volatile.
    In the face of energy crisis, Europe accepted natural gas 
as well as nuclear power as decarbonizing options. This allowed 
for certain investment, as I mentioned, FSRUs, as well as gas 
interconnections. However, many European countries see this fix 
as short-term, which translates into a hesitant approach and 
insufficient commitment to longer-term contracts, deficiency 
that can impact availability, affordability, as well as nature 
of LNG flows in the future, as some currently planned 
commercially oriented projects, including those in the U.S., 
may not come to fruition without sufficient financial backing. 
At the same time, state-supported enterprises, including 
Russian entities, do not face the same constraints. As the 
European crisis shows, responsible energy policy can and should 
consider ``all of the above'' options. Plans that are 
realistic, well-founded, and accessible will have a chance to 
propel actual change rather than those that are only written 
out as policy goals. For the U.S., this means responsible 
development and use of all of its resources that allow the 
country to use its competitive advantage while ensuring the 
well-being of its population. The abundant and diverse 
resources also increase U.S. geo-economic power, which, as we 
have seen over the last year, allows the country to step in and 
help its allies when the need arises.
    Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Mikulska follows:]

    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    The Chairman. Thank you so much.
    Now we will start our questioning, and I will start. I will 
begin with Director Jorgensen. The prices that Dr. Mikulska 
mentioned are absolutely accurate. It is just unbelievable the 
prices that Europe was paying at the peak of things, but we 
didn't have the production at that time and the spot markets 
were just out of control. We understand all of that. We are 
putting about 13 billion cubic feet a day into LNG. We have 
four more terminals coming online, so we should be up near 20 
to 25 billion cubic feet a day fairly soon, I am understanding. 
And with that, and other opportunities--I think Qatar is 
bringing more gas into the market--are you able, and Director 
Jorgensen, are you all looking at your longer-term contracts? 
Because I know the American producers are looking for a longer-
term contract with the Europeans to make sure you don't have 
that spike as you had.
    And one final thing, I want you to compare--everything that 
we are hearing about ESG, you have been hearing about that 
being kind of a governance. I am concerned, if you are only 
looking at ESG and you are not looking at the geopolitical risk 
and what you all have fallen into, geopolitical risk, that we 
never thought that Russia would do what they have done, but the 
havoc it has created in the economy and the suffering of the 
people, and also, just throwing caution to the wind on 
environmental concerns when it's survival, and could that be 
prevented or should that be taken into consideration with, 
basically, countries and companies making these decisions based 
only on one parameter and not on both equally?
    I know that is a lot in one question, but do the best you 
can.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Jorgensen. Thank you. Thank you very much, Senator.
    So first of all, we have expanded our import capacity. I 
just want to mention it, that there is significant additional 
capacity to import LNG as a response to the crisis. So we are 
able to offtake any additional supplies that will come online 
globally. Secondly, as you have said, long-term contracts are 
an important feature of the global natural gas market, and in 
particular, of the global LNG market, and it is a commercial 
position for companies whether they want to sign long-term 
contracts. And I think one consideration there is that the 
extreme volatility and uncertainty in global markets is 
certainly not helpful in that regard.
    We see an interest in long-term contracts to provide the 
security of supply, the stability in markets. We see with some 
concern that a number of U.S. suppliers have signed long-term 
contracts with Chinese buyers, and so we are following that 
market very closely and looking at what we can do from the 
European level, from the European Commission and member states 
to further support the development of long-term, stable markets 
and offtake. One of the things we have done there, as I 
mentioned, is to establish an energy platform that will work on 
joint purchasing, and we are currently working both with 
suppliers, but also with energy companies in Europe to see how 
to best support developments there to get more stability into 
the market and what is the role of long-term contracts in that 
context----
    The Chairman. I noticed this morning, so this morning's 
prices--you are at about $17 per million BTU, and we are down 
to about $2.50. But it has come down tremendously.
    Ms. Jorgensen. Yes.
    The Chairman. But it's still multiples. Where is your sweet 
spot? What are you looking for as far as the stability of your 
economy?
    Ms. Jorgensen. I would not be able to put a specific price 
level on that, but I do think we have seen the worst in the 
volatility.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    Ms. Jorgensen. Last year, we had in Europe--our gas prices 
at our domestic benchmarks were around 350 and they are now 
down close to 50. And so, in other words, we are out of that 
very worst volatility and extremely high prices. We have done 
what we can to avoid it by the demand reduction by the 
investments.
    The Chairman. Can you talk about the ESG versus, basically, 
geopolitical risk----
    Ms. Jorgensen. Yes.
    The Chairman [continuing]. And what the geopolitical risk 
has cost? I am understanding the UK has kind of thrown caution 
to the wind completely just trying to get through difficult 
times.
    Ms. Jorgensen. So ESG remains an important factor to guide 
our taxonomy as an important element----
    The Chairman. Sure.
    Ms. Jorgensen [continuing]. To guide investors to the 
extent they want to have a green profile or a green portfolio--
green funds, and that is useful in itself. That does not mean 
that investments into security, security of supply, are not 
relevant. It is an important selling point as well, if you 
will, from a sector perspective. And the way we have looked at 
it in terms of our public financing, our European financing, is 
that we will be financing more into the energy transition, but 
financing into the security of supply has been high priority, 
not least this last year, which is why we have helped fund a 
number of the new infrastructures that have come online.
    The Chairman. And I think the mild winter, the European 
mild winter, basically helped tremendously, I think, with your 
supply chain and also your reserves. What are you all 
anticipating for next year? Are you preparing for next winter--
next year, 2023?
    Ms. Jorgensen. Yes.
    The Chairman. Or this year.
    Ms. Jorgensen. So this winter we were indeed helped by 
somewhat milder weather, but it was not that unusually mild. It 
was milder, and that was a good thing in the current 
circumstances, but we were also helped by our measures on 
storage filling, on demand reduction, on price stabilization 
mechanisms, on solidarity mechanisms, and we were helped by the 
very close cooperation and support by allies, and in 
particular, the United States, supplying significant amounts of 
LNG to the European Union over the last year.
    As we go into next winter, and my co-panelist referred to 
the International Energy Agency ministerial yesterday, which 
indeed focused on energy security going into this next winter. 
It was an interesting discussion and there is interesting 
analysis from the International Energy Agency, essentially 
confirming that in the scenario of things continuing where they 
are, we are actually ready for next winter. We have given 
ourselves the instruments we need. We have built the supply 
opportunities that we need. We have built the infrastructure 
that we need. So barring a very cold winter, barring shortages 
from suppliers, barring other accidents, exogenous factors, we 
would be ready for next winter, provided of course, that we 
continue to reduce our demand and do the right thing across the 
European Union.
    The Chairman. One final thing, real quick before I turn to 
Senator Barrasso is, when you talk about long-term contracts, 
what time frame are you talking about? That means you are going 
to be needing this product and you are willing to sign a 
contract for--is it 5, 10, 15, 20, or longer?
    Ms. Jorgensen. So as I mentioned, we see natural gas as 
being part of the energy transition in the European Union. So 
our forecast, our analysis of how to get to climate neutrality 
in 2050 includes a share of natural gas in our energy system 
all the way between now and 2050.
    The Chairman. 2050.
    Ms. Jorgensen. The duration of long-term contracts, again, 
is up to the commercial actors, but there is nothing in our 
system that would stand in the way of that.
    The Chairman. That is very good. Thank you very much.
    Now to Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks so much, Mr. Chairman. I 
think your questioning is very insightful and informative. So 
thank you.
    I have a question for each of the three. I want to start 
with Dr. Mikulska.
    You know, many European countries have dramatically reduced 
their reliance on Russian natural gas. You can see where 
Russian natural gas supplies were up there in 2017 in terms of 
Europe's need. The two charts are showing it. The Russian 
natural gas is being replaced by liquefied natural gas, and 
where we are today, in 2022, LNG is the top. It used to be at 
the bottom. Now it is up at the top. And all of you have 
mentioned that.
    [The charts referred to follow:]

    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Barrasso. So before the war, Russia was the lead 
source of Europe's gas with LNG imports from all countries 
limited. The second chart, 2022, LNG imports moved to the top 
of the list, replacing Russian gas.
    So my question to you is, as more of our allies in Europe 
and around the world look to wean themselves off of Russian 
gas, how important is it, here in the United States, that we 
increase U.S. LNG export capacity?
    Dr. Mikulska. It is very important and that is because of 
the type of capacity that the U.S. releases--commercially 
oriented, not driven by politics or policy. So while we can 
talk about the different ways in which markets may be 
unpredictable, they still react to the demand and supply 
equation. And that is why Europe was able to attract so much 
LNG, because the prices were there and they were supporting the 
movement of U.S. LNG and other LNG into Europe.
    I think it is interesting to see that part of the LNG that 
Europe receives is from Russia though. So that is something 
also that needs to be considered going forward and it is 
probably better to have the U.S. commercially oriented LNG in 
Europe.
    Senator Barrasso. And then let me just turn then to Dr. 
Light regarding that answer and what you have just seen here on 
these charts. So we have heard how important increasing U.S. 
LNG export capacity is for European energy security. Now, I am 
aware of at least one project that, right now, is awaiting 
Department of Energy approval to build a floating LNG terminal 
off the coast of Mexico which would use U.S. natural gas. Would 
exporting this U.S. LNG from such a facility help boost global 
energy security?
    Dr. Light. It would, Senator Barrasso. If you are referring 
to the two Sempra projects, both of them have been permitted 
though, as of December.
    Senator Barrasso. All right. Well, we are going to continue 
to make sure that the permitting goes through.
    The Chairman. Build-out, right?
    Senator Barrasso. Well, yes. There are a number of issues 
and different permits for different components of it.
    Dr. Light. Absolutely, sir. And anything that you would 
like to flag for our attention we, of course, welcome it.
    Senator Barrasso. Great, thanks.
    And now for Director Jorgensen. So last month, the 
Washington Post published a front-page story. I have it right 
here: ``Power Titan Quietly Aids Russian War Effort.'' And the 
first line of the article reads, ``Russia's State nuclear power 
conglomerate is working to supply the Russian arms industry 
with components, technology, and raw materials for missile 
fuel, aiding Russia's deadly onslaught on Ukraine.'' Washington 
Post, front page story.
    [The article referred to follows:]

    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Barrasso. The article provides proof, and it is a 
long, involved article, that Russia's state-owned nuclear 
energy company, Rosatom, uses revenue from its nuclear sales, 
including uranium, to fund Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine. 
The article suggests that the European Union may soon implement 
sanctions against Rosatom.
    Can you update us on the status of the European efforts to 
cut off Russian uranium?
    Ms. Jorgensen. Yes, thank you, Ranking Member, indeed. 
First of all, the role of Russia and Rosatom in the global 
nuclear market--the fuels market--is indeed of concern. Within 
the European Union, we have five member states that are 
specifically dependent on Rosatom for the technical support for 
the fuel type, and that is for historic reasons that these 
countries have Russian-built nuclear facilities in their 
countries. So one priority for us is to reduce that dependence, 
to get out of that dependence, and help those countries and 
those nuclear facilities step out of the dependence on Russian 
supplies. That is part of our REPowerEU plan, and we will 
continue working on that and working with international 
partners, because some of the alternative fuel supplies could 
come from American companies or European companies. So we are 
working on that. And as Chairman Manchin mentioned, there is 
also concern about the high dependency on uranium, and that is 
a global concern that we need to work together to address.
    As regards sanctions, our approach is the following: we 
seek to apply the sanctions that are most effective vis-a-vis 
Russia--that have the most significant impact on Russia, while, 
of course, harming ourselves as little as possible. And in the 
field of the nuclear sector, we see that the impact would, at 
this point in time, probably be limited and it could cause a 
number of challenges for ourselves. We presented a tenth 
sanctions package yesterday. It does not cover these aspects, 
but, of course, we will see what happens and we will continue 
developing our response.
    Senator Barrasso. Mr. Chairman, if I could just ask Dr. 
Light to follow up on what we just heard there?
    The Chairman. Sure.
    Senator Barrasso. So in 2021, Russia was our third largest 
supplier of uranium to the United States, about 14 percent of 
our demand. It seems every dollar we give to Russia supports 
Putin's war against Ukraine. Our nuclear energy industry is 
ready to transition away from Russian uranium. My home State of 
Wyoming has vast uranium resources. It does seem that our 
nuclear fuel suppliers need assurance that Russia is not going 
to be able to continue to flood our market with cheap uranium. 
Do you agree we need to ban Russian uranium to provide American 
nuclear fuel suppliers with some market certainty?
    Dr. Light. Yes, Senator, I completely agree. We have got to 
explore all tools to limit Putin's ability to continue funding 
his invasion of Ukraine, certainly including nuclear. I think 
any uranium ban must be accompanied by, obviously, strategic 
investments in our own supply chain. So we completely support 
your efforts, all the efforts here, to try to include that in 
previous legislation, but also in proposed legislation. We look 
forward to discussing that with you. We definitely believe that 
our current nuclear reactors need to wean themselves off of the 
Russian supply. Absolutely.
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Heinrich.
    Senator Heinrich. Thank you all for being here.
    Director-General, can you talk a little bit about the role 
of electrification, and particularly heat pumps, in eliminating 
Europe's over-dependence on Russian fossil gas?
    Ms. Jorgensen. Yes, thank you. Electrification in general, 
and the deployment of heat pumps is an important part of 
becoming independent from Russian gas--Russian fossil 
supplies--but it is also an important part of the overall 
energy transition. We are going to see significantly increased 
electrification of our energy systems as a necessary part of 
the transition. It is going to rely on renewables, but also 
nuclear, as just discussed, and move away from fossil. And in 
that context, heat pumps are a very interesting option. We use 
about a third of our natural gas to heat homes, and if we can 
replace just some of that with heat pumps, we are better off. 
In addition to that, heat pumps are significantly more energy 
efficient. So it is an overall saving as well as a saving in 
fossil. So that is part of our REPowerEU plan. We have got a 
heat pump plan to secure the fastest possible rollout of heat 
pumps.
    In some of our member states last year, and I can state one 
example--in Poland, there was an increase of 120 percent in the 
installation of heat pumps last year. So quite an interesting 
example of the response to the crisis.
    Senator Heinrich. Director-General, with regard to ESG, 
which our Chairman brought up, do you think that governments 
should dictate governance priorities for private businesses, or 
should we generally leave that to the market and to the boards 
of those businesses to make those decisions?
    Ms. Jorgensen. Those decisions are business decisions, and 
for companies, the government role, the way we have approached 
it in Europe, is to set out guidance of what we would consider 
green investments. That is our taxonomy, but it is obviously 
from our----
    Senator Heinrich. So basically, a standard, and leave the 
decisions to the businesses themselves.
    Ms. Jorgensen. Indeed. And not a binding standard.
    Senator Heinrich. Right.
    Ms. Jorgensen. A type of guidance.
    Senator Heinrich. Yes.
    Dr. Light, U.S. utilities depend on imports of Russian-
enriched uranium for about 20 percent of their needs in our 
fleet of commercial nuclear reactor plants. That enriched 
uranium, as we heard from the Ranking Member, comes from 
Rosatom, which was exposed, as he mentioned, in the press 
recently as providing materials and other support to Russia's 
war effort in Ukraine. So in addition to a potential domestic 
ban on imports of Russian uranium, which I think is highly 
appropriate, what else could the U.S. be doing internationally 
to ensure that other nations do not indirectly support Russia's 
war effort through their nuclear sectors?
    Dr. Light. Thanks for the question, Senator.
    So there are a number of things here. While it is true 
that, for example, let's take some of the legacy Soviet-built 
plants in Eastern Europe that are dependent on a particular 
version of nuclear fuel. We are seeing U.S. providers, 
Westinghouse, in particular, moving into that market and trying 
to develop capacity there and have signed a number of MOUs, 
including with Ukraine, to help to displace that fuel. So that 
is a very good signal there.
    Number two, my office has been working with the State 
Department, with Commerce, and with others, to really increase 
U.S. competitiveness on the market on nuclear power, and not 
just on the fuel side, but also on power generation itself. I 
am very pleased to say that we just recently saw this great 
deal emerge between the U.S. and Poland to build three of their 
first six civilian nuclear reactors, which is going to be a $45 
billion deal, which will support 130,000 American jobs.
    And I think, third, it is that supply chain at home, but 
also the supply chain in other countries where we can rely on 
them as good partners. So diversification doesn't only mean 
independence, but it also means having reliable partners around 
the world, and through different international forums, we are 
trying to create the capacity there so we can stand together 
against Russia.
    Senator Heinrich. So we should leverage our allies to 
create that independence?
    Dr. Light. Absolutely, yes. I think that is a great way of 
putting it. We have to leverage our allies. We have to leverage 
our relationships. That is why our engagement in the world on 
energy in the midst of a struggle or even outside the current 
energy struggle is so important.
    Senator Heinrich. In June of last year, the Biden 
Administration announced the Partnership for Global 
Infrastructure and Investment with the G7. As part of that 
initiative, our government provided $14 million to support the 
first-of-its-kind deployment of NuScale Power's small modular 
reactor in Romania. What role do you see SMRs playing to 
support our EU allies' transition away from Russian fossil 
gas--Russian fossil fuels, broadly--and what are the hurdles to 
SMR deployment in Europe that we may be able to assist with?
    Dr. Light. So, very quickly, this is the most exciting 
thing, I think, we have on the energy horizon right now, is the 
final emergence of SMRs as a real viable possibility. And I 
have to say, I have been absolutely impressed with the fact 
that the part of the world I focused on the most with respect 
to who will deploy SMRs first is Eastern and Central Europe, 
and that was before the war started. So it's not only Romania, 
but it's interest in Bulgaria. It's interest in Poland. It's 
interest throughout the region where they have the expertise 
and the comfort of this kind of technology and seeing the 
advantages of SMRs, not only for electricity, but for district 
heating, for industrial decarbonization across the board. And 
we have many providers we have been incubating, with your 
support for decades now, and they are ready to unleash.
    I think we have got to work with these countries on the 
regulatory side, making sure that they are ready for the import 
of this technology, and even becoming regional hubs. And we 
have various programs throughout, again, many different 
international platforms we have been working on with our 
partners at State and Commerce and others to help to create 
that groundwork so countries can accelerate their import of 
that technology as these become available. It is incredibly 
exciting.
    Senator Heinrich. Thank you. Thank you, Chair.
    The Chairman. Senator Hyde-Smith.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you 
all for being here today. This is most helpful, and we 
certainly appreciate the efforts you have made to get here. And 
it is amazing that we are approaching the one-year anniversary 
of the invasion, and the effects of that and the continued 
Russian hostility certainly make it necessary for us to analyze 
everything we can of the critical role the United States has in 
a stable source of energy across the globe. But we can only do 
this with energy policies that allow Americans to flourish, 
that we can produce and not be paralyzed by policies and the 
agendas that harm that, and we witnessed the dangers firsthand 
when the Biden Administration enabled Russian energy 
initiatives before Putin's invasion. I believe more can be done 
to help stabilize that, both at home and across the globe if we 
were to unleash domestic energy production, including oil and 
gas, here in this country.
    Dr. Mikulska, this question is for you. In your written 
testimony, you discussed the four A's of energy security and 
your struggle to incorporate them, as well as some countries' 
willingness to overlook the risk associated with Russian energy 
dominance and dependence, particularly when it comes to the 
natural gas market. And the world watched as this came to a 
head after Russia's illegal invasion on Ukraine, and in 
response, U.S. LNG exporters boosted shipments to Europe by 
more than 137 percent in the first 11 months of 2022 from that 
same time period in the previous year in 2021, supplying more 
than half of Europe's imported LNG and helping the region 
survive a nearly 55 percent plunge in pipe shipments from 
Russia.
    What else besides LNG can the United States do that we can 
supply to help Europe grasp the four A's of energy security? 
What more can we do to accomplish that?
    Dr. Mikulska. I think nuclear power and engagement of the 
U.S. in Europe is critical, especially in Central and Eastern 
Europe. The deal in Poland has been extremely important on both 
ends, for energy security but also for the geopolitical 
security and for the working together of the two nations. Some 
countries in Europe do not have the environment to support 
efficient and effective solar or wind generation, and nuclear 
power helps accomplishing the goals of having domestically 
available supply at any given moment while also kind of 
addressing the goals that the EU is setting for those states.
    So I think nuclear energy cooperation is very important. 
SMR is as well--a lot of industry is quite interested in that. 
I know in Poland, in particular, industry parks and so on, so I 
think this is going to be critical, and having the U.S. as an 
ally and as a partner is extremely important.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Okay. You were pretty confident and 
quick in that answer of nuclear energy.
    And how did the Biden Administration's early action to 
restrict U.S. oil and gas production, how did that aid Russia's 
plan for energy dominance to flourish?
    Dr. Mikulska. Well, I think it allowed Vladimir Putin to 
feel sure that the invasion that he was planning would actually 
put a bigger hardship on Europe, for example. So that probably 
emboldened President Putin in getting through with his plans. 
Thankfully, these plans did not realize, but this is because of 
the way that U.S. LNG exports were ramped up. When we look at 
the exports and how they ramped up toward the peak of capacity, 
it has been something that is exceptional, something that U.S. 
industry--not only the government, but also U.S. industry--
helped Europe weather the storm, or at least until now, and 
hopefully going forward.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Hawley.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the 
witnesses for being here.
    Assistant Secretary Light, if I could just start with you. 
In the years leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, almost 
a year old now, many European governments prioritized what they 
called the climate objectives. I'm not sure that their policies 
actually improve their environment, but that was their 
surmise--climate objectives over energy abundance, and in 
particular, they prioritized cheap energy from an authoritarian 
regime over energy independence. Do you think that that 
playbook, executed by governments in Europe, is something we 
ought to be doing in the United States?
    Dr. Light. I think that the clear lesson is that no country 
should be beholden to one supplier for its energy sources, or a 
very large proportion of its energy sources, and that energy 
security is built on energy diversification. I think that 
energy diversification is at the backbone of U.S. energy 
policy, and so I do not see any risk that the United States 
will follow suit in that respect.
    Senator Hawley. Well, you say energy security is built on 
energy diversification. I would have thought energy security 
would be based on energy independence. Am I wrong about that?
    Dr. Light. I think it's independence, but I also think that 
it's not just one source of energy, because things can go 
wrong. No one should put all of their chips right on one marker 
when it comes to energy security. So I think to have as diverse 
a supply as possible while still looking at other goals, like 
climate goals, is a very good path forward for countries to 
take, and it is something that the United States wants to 
support other countries in helping to do.
    Senator Hawley. Why wouldn't we put our chips on American 
energy? We have got various sources of energy in this country. 
Why wouldn't we put our chips there?
    Dr. Light. I think we are putting our chips----
    Senator Hawley. No, we are not. We are producing less oil 
and gas in this country than we were previously. The President, 
when he came to office, his first day in office, he imposed a 
moratorium on oil and gas leases on federal lands. Since then, 
he has leased the fewest acres of federal land for oil and 
natural gas since the Truman Administration. Why are we 
shutting down American oil and natural gas production, taking 
away American jobs, and making ourselves more dependent on 
foreign sources of energy? I don't understand this policy.
    Dr. Light. Well, the U.S. will produce a record amount of 
both crude oil and natural gas in 2023, even higher than the 
spikes, the pre-COVID levels. And the President is actively 
encouraging U.S. oil producers to increase production and 
reinvest their profits back into production rather than buying 
back stocks, and I think that is the right policy to pursue.
    Senator Hawley. He is doing that while he is shutting down 
the ability to lease federal land for oil and natural gas, the 
fewest acres of federal land leased since the Truman 
Administration. He has boasted about how he hopes--he just said 
in the State of the Union that we may not need American oil 
after another ten years. I mean, what kind of a message does 
that send? Is that energy security?
    Dr. Light. So any questions about leasing on federal land, 
I would direct to the Department of the Interior, not the 
Department of Energy, sir.
    Senator Hawley. Listen, don't play that game with me. We 
are talking here about energy production. Oil and natural gas 
are energy production. And the facts of the matter are, this 
President has reduced our ability to be energy independent. And 
you are sitting here telling me that that increases our energy 
security. It looks just the opposite to me. It seems to me that 
you are recommending the European playbook, which left them 
dependent on foreign nations, left them dependent, ultimately, 
on hostile actors, and that is what you are trying to replicate 
here again in the United States. I just don't understand why 
this course of action is being recommended, why your 
Administration is pursuing it. I also don't understand why you 
would shut down pipelines that canceled thousands of good-
paying American energy jobs. I mean, why is that a healthy 
energy policy for this country?
    Dr. Light. With all due respect, sir, I really don't see 
much of a comparison between where Europe was before the 
outbreak of the war and their energy mix and where they were 
getting energy from and where the United States is today.
    Senator Hawley. Well, let me just ask you, just on the 
topic of dependence on authoritarian regimes, about China. 
China is one of the largest processors of the materials that 
serve as the building blocks for many of the so-called green 
energy transition that the Administration is pursuing. 
According to the IEA, China processes 40 percent of the world's 
copper, more than 30 percent of the nickel in the world, 60 
percent of cobalt, 60 percent of lithium, and more than 80 
percent of rare-earth minerals. Now, in light of that, many 
commentators have suggested that the United States is even more 
dependent on China for key components of solar power panels, 
wind turbines, and batteries than Europe was on Russia in the 
lead-up to the invasion of Ukraine.
    So I say again, in light of all of that, don't you think 
that this Administration's climate agenda is making us more 
dependent on China while we lessen our reliance on our own 
domestic energy sources?
    Dr. Light. Well, sir, as I said in my testimony before, I 
think you are absolutely right. China does own too much of the 
critical minerals supply chain from the beginning--from 
ownership of resources through processing and through the 
creation of modules and other parts of clean energy 
components----
    Senator Hawley. So why would you want to make us more 
dependent on them?
    Dr. Light. That is why we use the tools that the Congress 
has given us, sir, to make sure that we diversify the supply 
chains, reshore many of them, and create sound relationships 
with non-Chinese suppliers. That is absolutely a top priority 
of this Administration.
    Senator Hawley. For heaven's sake. Here's what you have 
done. You came to office. You took us from being an energy 
independent nation to being an energy dependent nation. You 
have made us more dependent. Now this Administration has gone 
begging to OPEC and dictators all around the world. You have 
made us less energy secure. Now you are making us energy 
dependent on China. You are canceling good-paying American 
jobs. It's a disaster. And all the while, increasing the costs 
of energy across this nation. It is an absolute disaster, and I 
can't imagine why, in light of what happened in Ukraine, we 
would want to replicate those disastrous policies here.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    And now we have Senator Hickenlooper.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you all 
for being here. It's a lively discussion.
    Let me start with Ms. Juul Jorgensen. Ms. Director-General, 
ten years ago, it would have been impossible to imagine anyone 
responding to an acute energy shock primarily by accelerating a 
move to renewable energy, but I think that is what we have seen 
over the last 12 months. We have a map here that shows a small 
sampling of headlines from across Europe over the past year.
    [The map referred to follows:]

    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Hickenlooper. Wind, solar, EV--records being set 
almost monthly. Permitting reforms to accelerate deployment. 
First-of-kind projects, proving out promising clean 
technologies, like floating offshore wind and green hydrogen. 
What has made modern renewable and other clean technologies 
Europe's first and best tools for heading off the acute energy 
crisis you are dealing with now?
    Ms. Jorgensen. Thank you, Senator.
    I think the first part of my response is a fact of geology 
and geography. We do not have the abundance of energy sources 
in Europe. We are net importers, to a very significant extent. 
So in other words, becoming completely independent is not 
possible. We need to rely on partners like the United States 
for secure energy. But we also need to become as resilient as 
possible within that reality. And one of the aspects, one 
necessary component of that resilience and that independence is 
renewable energy--solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, as the most 
used ones as well as biofuels and biomethane in the European 
Union. So the green transition is an absolute necessity for our 
security, for our independence, for our resilience in energy 
terms. Those two objectives--security of supply and the green 
transition--go hand-in-hand. The green transition is necessary 
for security of supply.
    The other aspect that I just want to flag briefly is the 
fact that the technology for renewable energy has developed 
very, very significantly over the last decades. The first 
offshore wind turbines that were established about three 
decades ago were essentially onshore turbines that were just 
put out into the water and they said let's see how it works. It 
worked, but with a fairly limited production generation. Now 
they are specifically produced. The technology has developed 
very, very significantly. And so, there is a significant 
quantity of energy coming from our renewable sources--offshore 
wind, but also solar, as the map shows.
    Thank you.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes. And as you say, it is able to 
allow geographies that don't have traditional access to their 
own energy resources to create energy resources where they did 
not exist before.
    Dr. Mikulska, last year, our LNG exports provided a vital 
lifeline to our European allies. You have heard a fair amount 
about that. While Europe's need for LNG is acute now, and will 
remain so for the near- and mid-term, who knows how long, what 
the long-term looks like is somewhat uncertain. What should the 
U.S. be doing now so that we can best continue to support 
Europe's energy security through the shipment of LNG while 
planning for a range of possible futures? Do you understand the 
question?
    Dr. Mikulska. Right.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Good.
    Dr. Mikulska. So what the path of the U.S. should be, 
right? And as the Director-General has mentioned here, the U.S. 
situation is quite different than the European situation. So it 
would be a mistake not to think all-of-the-above, in 
particular, what is currently available and what are currently 
the most reliable sources of energy supply. Renewable energy is 
there. It provides electricity. It provides additional sources, 
but it is not reliable yet. And that provides an issue for 
economic development, and it does create an issue of what kind 
of backup power do we want. So until then, we will be relying 
on fossil fuels--that we know--and nuclear energy and 
geothermal if it gets developed a little bit more or hydro. And 
the U.S. should look at all-of-the-above while making sure that 
its resources now are well-developed, and make sure that we 
have them, not only for ourselves, but also can supply our 
allies. And as we have seen, and by the admission of the 
Director-General, our allies want those resources, it is just 
the question which you actually put out there, what is the 
length of the short-term or medium-term that they need it for?
    Senator Hickenlooper. Got it.
    Dr. Mikulska. We don't know that.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes, I agree.
    And I am out of time, but Dr. Light, I just wanted to thank 
you for all your work, and I do agree that having more 
solutions--more energy sources--makes our country and the world 
more resilient and creates redundancy that is of immense value 
in times of hardship. So keep up the good work.
    The Chairman. And now we have Senator Daines.
    Senator Daines. Chairman Manchin, thank you.
    Over the past year--in fact 11 months--I have traveled to 
Europe several times. I visited ten countries across the 
continent--Ukraine, Romania, Germany, Lithuania, Estonia, 
Poland, Latvia, Moldova, Slovakia, and Hungary. One lesson 
stood out in every single country I visited--energy security is 
national security. I met with high-level leaders in government 
and industry. They all told me about the importance of reducing 
dependence on Russian energy and the critical role the United 
States can play. In Lithuania, I had a chance to visit their 
new LNG import terminal. By the way, that big ship that has the 
regasification process on top of it is called the Independence, 
for good reason, because with this terminal they now can turn 
away from Russia and begin importing LNG from the United States 
and other friendly nations. It's a big step for the energy 
security of Eastern Europe. We should be applauding and 
promoting more projects like it.
    What I fear though, is, we have an Administration that 
might say one thing occasionally in public, but they are not 
learning from the lessons of Europe. Europe's green delusion 
resulted in a near complete dependence on Russia for energy. 
Many countries shut down their baseload coal and nuclear plants 
without having a real plan. One leader in Europe, describing 
some of his colleagues to the north, said, ``a vision without 
an action plan is a hallucination.'' In fact, Europe went so 
far as to set a condition for Lithuania to get into the EU to 
decommission their nuclear plant. Lithuania used to be a net 
energy exporter, but because it was the green whim of the 
moment, went anti-nuclear for a period of time, they had to 
shut down their plant to get in the EU, leaving them very 
vulnerable. And thank God for LNG that is helping make up now 
for that loss of baseload power. It's truly baffling. We can't 
let this Administration take us down this same dangerous path. 
I don't think this Administration is learning anything from it. 
This religion, this pursuit of this green hallucination, is a 
dangerous moment in U.S. history and for the world.
    They are talking out of two sides of their mouth. On one 
hand, DOE is approving more LNG terminals to supply our allies. 
On the other hand, FERC is slow-walking pipeline approvals that 
would support these export terminals. You have to have 
infrastructure to get the gas to the ports. We take a step 
forward by banning Russian oil imports, but then the Department 
of the Interior cancels lease sales, increases fees and taxes 
on small producers, stalls a plan for offshore oil, enacts 
regulation after regulation to close on domestic production, 
and of course, he shuts down the Keystone Pipeline in Montana, 
which was, besides being a million barrels a day of oil, is $80 
million of tax revenues every year to impoverished counties 
across Montana. You have the President of the United States, in 
a State of the Union speech, he ad-libs, and he says we only 
need oil for the next ten years. It was a laughable moment. But 
even his own Energy Information Administration (EIA) says, 
``petroleum and natural gas will remain the most consumed 
sources of energy in the United States through 2050.'' That is 
coming right out of a subset of the DOE.
    Dr. Light, what's the deal? Does this Administration have a 
real plan to stop Putin's stranglehold on Europe, cut off his 
war chest that is funded by energy exports, or is this 
Administration talking out of both sides of its mouth?
    Dr. Light. Thank you very much for the question, Senator 
Daines. And I just have to say, personally, thank you very much 
for the travel that you have done in the region and the 
expressions of support of the American people to these 
countries who are on the front lines of everything. We really 
do appreciate that.
    I do believe we have a plan. I think that we have seen it 
in action. We have seen an absolute surge in LNG exports to 
Europe, far more than we did in 2021 and 2022. This did not 
happen by accident. It was not just, you know, purchasers in 
Europe deciding that they were going to turn to LNG out of 
desperation. There were a lot of concentrated efforts by this 
Administration, including at a very critical moment when there 
was a price crunch, and a supply crunch last year persuading 
the Japanese and the Koreans to defray some of their LNG tanker 
shipments that they were getting there, instead, to send some 
to Europe where they were more needed.
    Senator Daines. Yes.
    Dr. Light. So there is an effort here for cooperation that 
we were----
    Senator Daines. But I will tell you what, and I appreciate 
that. If I may interrupt, we just put the 100th judge on the 
bench of the Biden Administration. So while you talked about 
something that says it is necessary as an important step, it is 
not sufficient. When these far-left ideological judges are 
being put on the bench here, that interject themselves, 
stopping projects on the natural resource side of the equation 
that are lifetime appointments. And until we fix this problem, 
which is a long-term problem, permitting reform is a very good 
thing, but we still run a very real risk right now to 
activists, judicial leaders here who are driving an ideological 
agenda here who are anti conventional sources of energy.
    I want to move on to gas stoves. Europe is begging us for 
American energy, and now we have got the DOE throwing out all 
common sense, prohibiting 96 percent of existing gas stoves. 
Just when I thought it could not get more ridiculous, it did. 
My question is, the White House recently said it does not 
support banning gas stoves, but the proposed rule effectively 
bans 96 percent of existing gas stoves. What is the truth?
    Dr. Light. The President does not support the banning of 
gas stoves, Senator----
    Senator Daines. I want to know what the rule is though. I 
understand what the President says up in front because he 
knows, politically, he has got an absolute firestorm on his 
hands because people are looking back and they are saying this 
is ridiculous.
    Dr. Light. So sir, I would be very happy to arrange for a 
meeting between the staff for the----
    Senator Daines. Is it the truth? Does the rule ban 96 
percent of existing gas stoves?
    Dr. Light. Right, and that is outside the purview of my 
office. I am sorry, sir, but I am International Affairs.
    Senator Daines. You don't have an answer. We want to get an 
answer to that. Yes.
    Dr. Light. EERE, I am sure, would be very happy to have a 
meeting with your staff to talk about those questions and get 
to a good answer.
    Senator Daines. Thank you.
    Senator Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Cortez Masto.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to 
the panel members who are here today.
    Assistant Secretary Light, both you and Director-General 
Jorgensen, in your testimonies, discussed the need for the U.S. 
and European Union to work together to secure reliable access 
to critical mineral supply chains. And as you know, Secretary 
Granholm was in northern Nevada last week to announce a $2 
billion loan guarantee to help Nevada-based Redwood Materials 
manufacture and recycle critical components of lithium-ion 
batteries. We all know these batteries are going to play a 
crucial role in expanding our clean energy economy. These 
investments are possible due in part to the creation of the 
battery grant program that was created here as part of the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, something that I absolutely 
supported and will continue to, and we need to continue to 
support the processing and refining that we have done here 
through the programs that we have passed.
    Nevada, and I cannot stress this enough, is really the 
growing nexus for a clean energy and critical mineral future 
because it is the only state in the U.S. that encompasses every 
facet of the critical mineral and advanced battery economy, 
from the mining of the critical mineral deposits, to the 
research and development, to processing and manufacturing, and 
finally, to the recycling operations. This is a perfect example 
of the economy that we believe that we should be investing in.
    So let me ask you this, and let me start with Assistant 
Secretary Light. One, how is DOE utilizing these new programs 
that we have been talking about, and authorities to address 
these international supply chains? And then, how do you 
envision the collaboration that the two of you have been 
talking about that we need to do? So Secretary Light, let me 
start with you.
    Dr. Light. Thanks very much, Senator, for the question. I 
know the Secretary enjoyed her trip to Nevada very much. I 
mean, it is, as you said, just a great object lesson in how we 
can sort of see the future, where all of it is done, you know, 
in one place, from the mining to the manufacturing and 
refining, and it goes on through the entire supply chain. So 
using the authority and the funds provided by the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure legislation and the Inflation Reduction Act, we 
are doing a number of things. We have already issued a number 
of awards and announcements, including $74 million in funding 
to selected advanced domestic battery recycling and reuse, $315 
million for a long-duration energy storage demonstration 
project FOA, $30 million for energy storage lab calls, $12 
million for lithium extraction and conversion from geothermal. 
It just goes on and on and on. The people working on that, in 
that part of the building, have one of the greatest jobs 
because they get to be as creative as possible on this to make 
sure that we can, as Senator Barrasso pointed out, respond to 
China, which is already way out in front in a very dangerous 
way, in a way that is analogous to where Russia was with Europe 
on the gas supply. And so, we have got to stop that and we are 
deploying everything we can, not only to reshore, but to create 
those supply chains here on those credits.
    I would also like to say that we are doing this globally, 
internationally. DOE, along with the European Commission, is 
part of four platforms, separate platforms from the Mineral 
Security Partnership, where we are looking at how we can 
combine resources on acquisition of this technology to advance 
work through different platforms to work on recycling and all 
these other measures to increase diversification of supply in 
critical technologies. And I am very proud to say that one of 
the singular achievements that Secretary Granholm achieved when 
she chaired the International Energy Agency Ministerial last 
March, was to create a new voluntary stockpiling program for 
critical minerals in the International Energy Agency. IEA, as 
you know, was created to stockpile oil. Now we are going to 
look at stockpiling critical minerals as well in case we get 
these bottlenecks, whether they happen by accident or 
intentionally, and have something to hedge against them.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    And Director-General Jorgensen, any thoughts on the 
collaboration, what we should be thinking about here?
    Ms. Jorgensen. Yes, I think first of all, that indeed, 
collaboration, cooperation with partners, with allies, is 
absolutely essential for our energy security because our energy 
security relies on critical raw materials--in particular, raw 
materials for renewable energy, but also for batteries and 
energy storage. So it is essential that we work together.
    We have our own program, and will be presenting in just a 
few weeks a Critical Raw Materials Act within the European 
Union, as well as a Net Zero Industry Act, and so that is our 
European part of it. And linked to that, of course, is the very 
close international cooperation. We have got the Critical Raw 
Materials Alliance. We have got work in the International 
Energy Agency. And so, we are going to continue the close 
cooperation and step it up, also, in the context of the USEU 
Energy Council meeting just a few months from now.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    I know my time is just about up. I will submit the rest of 
my questions for the record.
    Thank you again for the panel members that are here today.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Now, we are going to Senator Risch because of the 
generosity of Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Risch. Thank you, Senator Murkowski. Well, and 
thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I wanted to come today to talk a little bit about a really 
significant and serious problem that the U.S. is facing, and I 
am going to ask Dr. Light about it a little bit, but first of 
all, let me set the stage for this. The world collectively 
relies on Russia for the nuclear fuel supply chain, with one-
third of conversion and half of the enrichment capacity coming 
out of Russia. This is for nuclear generating electric 
facilities. The U.S. receives about 20 percent of its enriched 
uranium from Russia, which is not currently sanctioned. We have 
almost no domestic uranium processing with no operational 
conversion and only one active enrichment facility. We cannot 
currently produce the necessary enriched uranium to supply the 
current nuclear fleet that we have, and for research needs, and 
obviously, for national defense needs. Idaho, as most of you 
know, is the home of the Idaho National Lab, the birthplace and 
flagship lab for nuclear energy in America--indeed, in the 
world--indeed, in the universe. In 1951, we generated the first 
electricity there using nuclear energy. And since then, we have 
been on the cutting edge of that.
    Right now, all of us are familiar with the fact of what 
Russia has done, this illegal war that it is pursuing against 
Ukraine, and its absolute lack of judgment in conducting its 
affairs in the world is really remaking the face of Europe and 
the face of the world when it comes to supply chains in a lot 
of matters. When this war is over, it won't be over. We, along 
with 29 other countries, formed NATO to push back against 
Russia, and it kind of went to sleep as we went along over the 
decades, everybody thinking that when the Iron Curtain came 
down that Russia was going to more or less behave itself and 
join the international players, maybe poison a few people once 
in a while. That is what they do. Interfere in elections once 
in a while. That is what they do. But other countries do that 
too, and we started doing business with them, as did Europe, 
and Europe got tied into them even more than we did.
    Nobody believed that they would start a medieval war in the 
21st century, but that's where we are. When this is over, our 
relationship with Russia is not going to repair for a long, 
long time, nor is, obviously, Ukraine or Europe. There is not 
going to be a reconciliation commission where we all get 
together. What these people--what the Russians have done in 
Ukraine is barbaric. It's unforgiveable. And it's going to be 
decades and decades before anybody that is in their right mind 
does business with Russia again. So that brings me to the 
problem that we have. And that is that we have this supply 
chain with the fuel coming out of Russia. Now, the Ranking 
Member and Chairman and I have produced legislation that we are 
going to get in and try to resolve this problem to a degree, 
but this is a serious problem.
    So Dr. Light, your question, since you are in charge of 
International Affairs at the Department of Energy, what would 
you do tomorrow if you got to the office and somebody handed 
you a pink slip that said, oh, the Russians called and they are 
done. They are not giving us any more supply. What plan do you 
have to respond to that situation?
    Dr. Light. Can I say, sir, that the way that you 
articulated where we are with Russia and the problems going 
forward, I could not agree more, a thousand percent. I think 
you are absolutely right. It is astonishing what has happened, 
and this energy struggle will continue.
    Senator Risch. It changes the world, and for the 
foreseeable----
    Dr. Light. It totally does, sir, and having grown up in the 
Cold War, I can't believe we are here again, frankly.
    Senator Risch. Here we are.
    Dr. Light. But I will not take up your time with that.
    If we had that pink slip, sir, then I hope we have your 
legislation in hand to already start the process to get out of 
that dependency. We absolutely have to make strategic 
investments to strengthen our domestic supply chain so that we 
are not in this position--we never are in that position again. 
Our current reactors will need some time to wean off, but if it 
is shut off, then we have got to be there, and I think that we 
are going to do everything we can to make sure, with the 
current authority that we have already in the legislation that 
you planned, that we are in a position where we can respond to 
that.
    Secondly, we have got to look also at the technologies of 
the future. The most amazing thing about Idaho today is these 
test beds on the small modular reactors, which are just so 
encouraging and so fantastic and so, I think, where we really, 
definitely need to----
    Senator Risch. Those are the future. There is no question 
about that.
    Dr. Light. Those are the future, and we need to make sure 
that the fuel for those SMRs, again, we do not find ourselves 
in a position where the United States is not producing its own 
supply for that, so in HALEU as well, we have got to move 
forward and make--and move toward nuclear fuel independence.
    Senator Risch. Well, thank you, Dr. Light. And I am sure 
you will agree with me, as the Ranking Member and Chairman and 
I believe that this is not a partisan issue. This is an 
American issue.
    The Chairman. For sure.
    Senator Risch. And it is an issue that is of critical 
importance, and more importantly than that, the issue, 
unfortunately, does not lend itself well to the pace at which 
we move around here. And this really needs to move forward. So 
thank you for your thoughts in that regard. I hope you will 
join us in doing our best to get this legislation passed.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Kelly.
    Senator Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Dr. Light, there are some U.S. oil companies that are still 
operating in Russia, despite pledges to wind down their 
operations. National Oilwell Varco, which is a U.S. company 
based in Houston, has oil field services in Russia, still even 
after announcing in a press release a year ago that it was, and 
this is a quote, ``actively examining our alternatives, 
including the potential to further curtail our activities.'' In 
March of last year, 2022, Schlumberger announced that it would, 
another quote, ``immediately suspend new investments in 
technology deployment to our Russian operations.'' But just 
seven months later, Schlumberger, still in Russia, was caught 
distributing military draft notices to 9,000 of its Russian 
employees to supply forces to Putin's mass mobilization effort.
    So Dr. Light, for some of these companies, it sounds just 
like business as usual in Russia. In May, I wrote a letter to 
Secretary Granholm and Secretary Yellen asking them to evaluate 
oil companies that are still operating in Russia. So could the 
Department please take a closer look into this and provide me 
with a report on the operating status of U.S. oil companies 
still in Russia? And things specifically like this, I mean, I 
just find this, you know, just very concerning that a company 
that is based in London, that trades on the New York Stock 
Exchange, is assisting Vladimir Putin in getting his draft 
notices to his citizens. That is just unacceptable.
    So I would appreciate you looking into this.
    Dr. Light. I am happy to take that on, sir, and even though 
it is Treasury and Commerce who enforce those sanctions and 
compliance, I am very happy to work with you and your staff to 
schedule a briefing as soon as possible to talk about the 
Russian sanctions, their impact on the industry, and what we 
know and what we need to know in order to address this problem 
moving forward. So we would welcome that conversation.
    Senator Kelly. Yes, I think these companies should have had 
plenty of time to wind down operations by now and shouldn't be 
assisting in Russia's war in Ukraine.
    Ms. Jorgensen, as you know, oil revenue is how Putin 
finances his illegal invasion, and in December, the West capped 
the price of Russian oil at $60 a barrel, well below the global 
market price of $85. It appears that the cap is having the 
intended effect of depressing revenue without directly cutting 
the global supply. The Kremlin's income from oil and gas is the 
lowest that it has been since the beginning of the pandemic. 
Some analysts estimate that Russia only earned $5 billion from 
fossil fuels in January, which is about half compared to 
January of the previous year. So on Friday, Russia--this past 
Friday--Russia announced it was cutting crude oil production by 
500,000 barrels per day, which is about five percent of the 
country's output, and the propagandists there say that the cuts 
are in retaliation for the oil price caps, but I think it is 
worth noting that Russia's decision came days after it endorsed 
the OPEC Plus plan.
    So Ms. Jorgensen, how would you describe the effectiveness 
of these price caps, and could they eventually diminish 
Russia's ability to invest in future production?
    Ms. Jorgensen. Thank you, Senator.
    So far, as your question indicates, we have seen quite a 
significant effect of the price cap. I think it is important to 
note that the price cap comes on top of what was already a full 
embargo on oil and coal exports, with a small exception for 
some pipeline oil for reasons of security of supply for a 
couple of member states, but really 90 percent of our oil 
imports were already under a full ban. We have banned 
investments into the energy sector in Russia and we have banned 
exports of any technology that is necessary for extraction or 
LNG. So the price cap comes on top on these very significant 
sanctions already in place.
    Senator Kelly. And are our allies complying with this, 
fully complying with this cap?
    Ms. Jorgensen. So far, the results are good, both in terms 
of reducing the profits for Russia in this sector, but also in 
terms of ensuring compliance. This measure, put together 
jointly with partners, including the United States, seems to be 
effective. We have, within the European Union, appointed an 
official to be responsible, including formulations with 
international partners to ensure that there is compliance with 
the sanctions. So, I think, so far so good, but we of course 
continue to monitor very, very closely.
    Senator Kelly. What would happen if we changed the cap to 
$50 or $40?
    Ms. Jorgensen. It is possible within the cap, within the 
measure we have taken, to reduce downward, so we will see over 
time how the markets develop and what is the most effective way 
of approaching it. So I think we have, so far, as I said, put 
in place nine sanctions packages. We have presented a tenth. 
And we will be ready to do what is necessary----
    Senator Kelly. Yes, I think that is worth looking into.
    Thank you.
    Senator Barrasso [presiding]. Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And I want to thank both you, Ranking Member Barrasso, and 
Chairman Manchin for convening this really timely discussion on 
global energy security and thank the panelists for your 
contribution to this. I think it is absolutely clear, the 
energy world has changed. It has changed in the here and now, 
and to the point that Senator Risch made, you know, you can't 
undial this. You cannot take back the atrocities that we have 
seen perpetrated on the innocent people of Ukraine. You can't 
just say that once this war is ended, we are back to normal. 
There is no new normal. Well, there will be a new normal, but 
the normal will not be what we know today. So when we think 
about the disruption of a global pandemic and what that meant 
to energy supply and security and then you overlay the war in 
Ukraine, brought about by Russia, it is transformational in a 
way that I am not sure that any one of you, with as much 
expertise as you bring to the table, really can anticipate how 
we build this out in a way that is capable of really 
recognizing the changed dynamic.
    And so, you kind of look back when you are trying to figure 
out how you move forward. There is a little bit of a parallel, 
historically, when you think about the oil crisis of the 70s, 
and here in this country we woke up and said, well, we have an 
opportunity to weigh in and make a difference here. We can 
produce more supply, and it was that very transformational 
decision in the mid-70s that allowed Alaska to help lead the 
country with building our oil pipeline from the North. It 
really helped to make a difference, not only for the United 
States, but for our allies.
    It has been noted that Russia has just made this 
announcement that they are cutting production another 500,000 
barrels a day. We have an opportunity in Alaska, as we speak, 
the Administration has just a matter of weeks to determine 
whether they are going to announce a final record of decision 
on a project up north, the Willow Project, that would provide 
for 180,000 barrels a day. That's real production. That's real 
production in the here and now, and yet, there is some concern 
by the Administration that perhaps the recommendation from 
their own agency might take them in a different direction--
might take them in a direction where they either do not approve 
the Willow Project or, worse, it's kind of a sleight of hand 
and they approve it, knowing that what they have changed 
results in an economically unviable project. That would be a 
travesty, not only to Alaska, but to the country, and, I think, 
our allies, who are wondering--we have got issues here that we 
are facing.
    Director-General, you have noted the efforts that the 
European Union has taken to work through some very scary winter 
months, and looking at next year, you think you can make it 
again, but our reality is that when we move to address the 
supply, supply makes a difference.
    And so, I have not asked a question here, but I want to 
just make clear my message to you, Dr. Light. You may say that 
this is a decision within the Department of the Interior and 
you are Energy, but you are also part of the Administration, 
and I would kindly ask you to take back to the White House the 
imperative of what it can mean to bring on meaningful 
production in this country in an area where we are poised to 
refill that pipeline that we built in the mid-70s.
    I want to direct a question to you, Director-General. I 
spent a lot of time with our Arctic partners. I was in Norway 
just recently and they shared with me how they had really 
ramped up their production of natural gas to help offset Europe 
at this time of real crisis with supply, and it has been 
remarkable what they have been able to do just as one producing 
nation there. And when I asked them, well, how sustainable is 
this? If this continues, and again, we have a new energy world 
in front of us, can you continue to meet that demand? And it's 
not unlike what we face here. It's about the capacity. How do 
you move it through existing pipe?
    So my question to you is, have these discussions continued 
at a level where you are looking to the longer-term solutions 
of additional supply within Europe that can help move the 
European Union forward?
    Ms. Jorgensen. Thank you, Senator, and indeed, we have had 
as an immediate focus to get through that first winter of 
crisis, that first year of the war to make sure we got that 
security, and I have outlined the mechanisms, the instruments 
we have given ourselves. The next focus was then on the coming 
years, the coming winter, how do we fill our storage for the 
coming winter? How do we put more renewables online, more 
alternative energy sources online, and how do we reduce our 
consumption so that we can help contribute also to stabilizing 
global markets? And the focus, then, is on the years after 
that. As I said, the next winter looks encouraging. We have 
done what we can. We still have to be careful. There is no room 
for complacency, but we are prepared. And if we look between 
now and 2030, we can see that global energy markets and the 
natural gas markets will remain tight. There will be some 
supply/demand gap, and so we need to respond to that together.
    Our planning in terms of how the energy system stays both 
secure, affordable, and sustainable goes to 2050 with the Green 
Deal plan for the changes in the system. And that includes all 
the different relevant energy sources. We have mentioned 
natural gas as part of that transition. That will stay with us 
over the coming decades, increasing--significantly increased 
levels of renewables, continued nuclear as part of the European 
energy system, and a continued effort and investment into 
energy efficiency to lower consumption. So that long-term 
planning is very much part of what we do and part of what we do 
together with our member states. Each member state is 
responsible for its own energy mix and each member state draws 
up a national energy and climate plan for how to achieve the 
targets for 2030 and beyond. So there is a close coordination 
as part of that.
    You mentioned Norway. We have seen significantly increased 
supplies from Norway, primarily of pipeline gas. We had, in the 
second half of last year, the very important opening of the 
Baltic Pipe that transports natural gas from Norway to Poland. 
So that has been a very important contribution to making that 
part of Europe energy secure.
    Senator Murkowski. But we also recognize the vulnerability 
of those pipelines as well, something that the Ranking Member 
has focused on as well.
    Thank you, Madam Chairman. I am well out of time.
    Senator Cortez Masto [presiding]. Thank you.
    Senator Cantwell.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to thank 
the Chairman of the Committee and Senator Murkowski for leading 
the charge last year in banning Russian energy imports and I 
commend the Administration for putting a price cap on Russian 
oil to help cripple Russia's key revenue efforts in funding its 
war. I think the vast majority of Congress and the American 
public agree that we need to continue to punish Putin and his 
cronies for the outrageous assault on Ukraine.
    I think what we also need to think about is how we continue 
to learn lessons here and move forward to make sure that our 
economy is not as vulnerable to the continued rule and pain 
from various markets, and to continue to make investments that 
are going to help us diversify off of the sources of energy 
that we are on today.
    I do want to focus on an aspect of this hearing though, and 
that is the vulnerability of our nation to cyberattack, our 
pipeline to foreign agents. The weapon here is not withholding 
oil or natural gas supplies, but rather disrupting them. I see 
a nod already from the Director-General. The Colonial Pipeline 
system cyberattack two years ago was a wakeup call, exposing 
the threat facing our nation's pipeline infrastructure, and it 
was not just pipelines. According to a CEO who testified before 
this Committee on cybersecurity threats last year, Russian 
hackers got dangerously close to knocking out a big chunk of 
the American grid, and the Russian malware they used is still 
out there.
    So after Colonial Pipeline, as well as the Texas big freeze 
event, it became clear that we cannot ensure the reliability of 
the bulk power system without ensuring the reliability of the 
natural gas pipeline, and the two are linked--our bulk 
electricity system and our energy pipeline system. So this 
Committee, thanks to the leadership of Senators Manchin and 
Murkowski, recently directed FERC to establish incentives for 
cybersecurity technology investment in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure bill, but I believe more needs to be done. FERC 
Chair Chatterjee and Commissioner Glick called for a 2018 
mandatory cybersecurity standard for pipelines, and with the 
help of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation--
NERC and FERC--they have approved and enforced vital mandatory 
cybersecurity standards for the electricity system. These 
standards work and have been around for over a decade, but as I 
understand it, there are no comparable mandatory comprehensive 
standards for nearly three million miles of natural gas, oil, 
and hazardous liquid pipelines across the United States. That 
is why I plan to introduce legislation that FERC has a clear 
role in protecting our pipelines from cybersecurity attacks.
    So Dr. Light, do you believe that cybersecurity threats to 
the national gas pipeline system, including those by foreign 
state actors like Russia, represent a serious threat to our 
national security?
    Dr. Light. I do, Senator.
    Senator Cantwell. Okay, thank you. Well, we will look 
forward to working with the Administration then on trying to 
get that done.
    Dr. Light. Absolutely, Senator. And can I say----
    Senator Cantwell. Yes.
    Dr. Light. Can I add one quick thing?
    Senator Cantwell. Yes.
    Dr. Light. We have also been working out of my office on 
strengthening cybersecurity with our partners in Eastern and 
Central Europe. We started with Ukraine. Some of the $30 
million appropriation that my office got before the war started 
was focused on trying to clean out the Ukrainian energy system 
so that it could prepare for integration with the European 
energy system. We have our signature partnership with Eastern 
and Central Europe, which is called the Partnership for 
Transatlantic Energy and Climate Cooperation, our ministerial 
with 24 countries, and Secretary Granholm will be in Zagreb on 
March 1 and 2. We have a working group on cybersecurity that I 
co-chair with Lithuania and several members there so we can use 
the abilities that we have at Idaho National Lab and at PNNL, 
as well, to train a number of governments in the region, also, 
to know how to hunt out, find, and secure themselves against 
cyberattacks from actors like Russia.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Dr. Light, I appreciate that.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Senator Lee.
    Senator Lee. Thank you.
    Director-General Jorgensen, I would like to start with you, 
if that is all right?
    In your opening statement, in your written statement 
submitted to the Committee, you have indicated that you have, 
in your words, ``doubled down on a clean energy transition'' 
and that recent events have ``proved that European institutions 
and democracy are robust and prepared for the challenge.'' 
Recent events, however, tell a little bit of a different story, 
a slightly different story than that. Russia extorted the EU by 
throttling gas flows into the continent, and member countries 
started the winter with severely depleted natural gas stores. 
EU energy prices doubled in many member states, and mercifully, 
the EU was bailed out of a dire situation when 56 billion cubic 
meters of U.S. natural gas came through, along with an 
unusually mild winter. We saw Green New Deal member states 
cutting down old growth forests and starting coal-fired power 
plants just to keep warm. These are not necessarily signs of 
things going well.
    So what can you tell me about what steps the EU is taking 
to ensure that we have got proven, dispatchable energy sources 
that will be available in the future when these interruptions 
occur, because as I am sure you would agree, burning wood is 
one of the dirtier things people can burn.
    Ms. Jorgensen. Indeed, thank you, Senator, for the 
question. I think there is a history until the 24th of February 
2022 and the history after that. Before February 2022, before 
the 24th of February, we were highly dependent on Russian 
fossil fuels as part of our energy mix. As I mentioned earlier, 
we are net importers. We do not have significant domestic 
extraction of energy, and so the most domestic source we have 
is renewable energy. And we have invested in that to build that 
out as part of our energy system.
    Senator Lee. Is sawdust considered part of that? Sawdust? 
Wood chips? I am told by some definitions those are considered 
renewable when they burn the pelletized sawdust.
    Ms. Jorgensen. Part of our renewable mix is what we call 
biofuels, and we have sustainability criteria to make sure that 
there is not a negative impact overall in the environment and 
climate in using biofuels as part of the energy mix.
    From the 24th of February 2022, very shortly after that, we 
decided to reduce that dependence on Russia. We decided that 
that was not an acceptable situation. This was decided 
unanimously by all European heads of state in government. And 
what you have seen since the 24th of February last year is a 
significant reduction--more than a significant reduction, as a 
cut in that dependence on Russia. We got through that year 
without any shortages. We got through that year with secure 
supplies. We got through that year, as you said, with very high 
energy prices as a result of the global energy crisis, as a 
result of that global supply/demand gap in natural gas.
    Senator Lee. Right, even during a wet, mild winter, right?
    Thank you. I have got limited time.
    Dr. Mikulska, you described the potential impact of EU 
countries, in effect, crossing their fingers, and not 
purchasing long-term gas contracts, hoping that they will be 
able to sort of will themselves into carbon neutrality, hoping 
for the best, despite past performance and no sign that they 
are going to be able to do that.
    What impact could this have on Russia's ability to continue 
to use natural gas as a geopolitical tool for economic 
extortion?
    Dr. Mikulska. Well, we do know, as many tables here have 
shown, that the Russian gas is still flowing to Europe both via 
pipeline and as LNG, which speaks to the persistence of that 
fuel. While EU was able to ban oil in most of the cases, this 
has not been the case for Russian gas, and that creates 
instability that is there. Thankfully, there are ways in which 
LNG imports can be ramped up. However, for the next two to 
three years, those LNG imports will be limited by the supply, 
so there is a big problem with potential instability--
volatility of prices--even if the storage that is currently at 
really high levels remains at high levels.
    Senator Lee. Right, and that--this could all lead to a 
problem, I assume, if, especially--what I would like to know 
is, what would happen if American LNG were no longer available 
to flow into foreign markets, particularly into Europe? I ask 
because on the domestic front, we have seen extraordinary 
efforts by the current Administration to prevent future oil and 
gas exploration. What would be the effect of that if we no 
longer had American LNG to go into global markets?
    Dr. Mikulska. It is almost hard to imagine, so I am hoping 
that is not going to be the case, because what U.S. LNG is 
helping with is making the markets much more commercial, 
depending on supply and demand, and in a way, actually reducing 
the volatility that could be caused by political actors. And I 
think that is very important. We will see potentially high 
prices based on shortages of supply and hikes in demand, but 
having those shortages based on political decisions of foreign 
actors that are not friendly toward us or our allies is the 
biggest problem, and we have seen this with Russia and the war 
in Ukraine. And that is something that we would like to 
absolutely avoid. And U.S. exports of both oil and gas have 
provided the U.S. with geopolitical power that literally checks 
the power of other actors, the large producers, that are often 
authoritarian states, and that do not necessarily have the best 
interests of the U.S. or its allies in mind.
    Senator Lee. Thank you. I see my time is expired. Thanks.
    The Chairman  [presiding]. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Hirono.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Ms. Jorgensen, I commend the EU for its decision to reduce 
its dependence on Russian oil and to lend a lot more support 
for renewables. That is exactly what Hawaii is doing. It is 
going to take all of us to stop the Russians.
    Hawaii has made a lot of progress toward its renewable 
energy goal, reaching over 40 percent last year, but it is 
still the most petroleum-dependent state in the nation, and 
basically, Hawaii started off being 100 percent, pretty much, 
dependent on importation of oil from outside of our state 
because we are not an oil-producing state at all. So after 
Russia's invasion, people in Hawaii faced high prices at the 
gas pump and on their energy bills. Not the only state to have 
that experience, but with Hawaii having increases of 10 to 20 
percent due to the use of oil to generate electricity. 
Fortunately, oil prices have come down and the addition of new 
renewable projects is set to lower bills across Hawaii.
    Ms. Jorgensen, your testimony mentioned that the EU has, 
``ensured tailored support for vulnerable households and 
businesses to withstand high and volatile energy prices.'' What 
are the policies that you think have been helpful to people in 
Europe?
    Ms. Jorgensen Thank you, Senator.
    Indeed, households and businesses across the European Union 
were faced with extremely high energy prices during this crisis 
over the last year, since the war and before the war, as Russia 
was starting to weaponize energy----
    Senator Hirono. Yes.
    Mr. Jorgensen [continuing]. And bring up prices. We have 
put in place a series of measures. First of all, given 
flexibility, given room for member states to support some of 
their industries with the very, very high energy prices, we 
have created fiscal space to compensate consumers--both 
households and businesses--through a revenue cap in electricity 
generation and through a solidarity contribution. So we have 
created instruments, at a European level, common European 
instruments that give room for member states to provide the 
compensation and help households. One of the issues we are 
seeing in this energy crisis is, we of course need to maintain 
the incentives for demand reduction. Continued demand reduction 
is necessary for the European Union to remain energy secure. We 
need to act both on the demand and on the supply side. And so, 
in order to do that, we have sought to design the measures in a 
way that did not take away the energy-saving incentives that 
high prices do constitute.
    Senator Hirono. So what role do you see for the additions 
of renewable energy in the European Union for reducing the 
level and volatility of energy prices in the future?
    Ms. Jorgensen. We see a significant role for renewable 
energy in that context, again, both for our security of supply, 
for our resilience, and for our climate targets, our climate 
goals. We have already, last year, accelerated significantly 
the build-out of renewables in the European Union, a 
significant amount of gigawatt was added. What we did to 
achieve that was both to facilitate our permitting rules to 
accelerate permitting because there is typically some delay in 
the procedures----
    Senator Hirono. For renewables.
    Ms. Jorgensen. For renewables.
    And in addition to that, we have made investment and 
funding available at the European level to go into renewable 
energy. We will continue with that over the coming years, so as 
to achieve the targets we have set for ourselves for the 
renewable share.
    Senator Hirono. What are your targets in terms of reliance 
on renewables? Do you have a percentage target? Because Hawaii 
is seeking to be 100 percent renewable for electricity by 2045. 
What are the EU's targets, as a percentage?
    Ms. Jorgensen. We aim to have a 45 percent share of 
renewables in our energy mix by 2030. That is a proposal from 
the European Commission that is currently under discussion with 
our co-legislators.
    Senator Hirono. My best to you in achieving those targets.
    Ms. Jorgensen. Thank you.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    And now, we have a returning member, who just can't stay 
away from this electric type of committee we have and the 
vibrant hearings that we hold. So we are happy to have you 
back, Senator.
    Senator Lankford. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, thank you for 
allowing me to be able to slip back in as well. So the 
witnesses, thank you for your ongoing work on this.
    I do have just a couple of questions dealing with LNG, 
specifically, and how we are getting natural gas to Europe and 
some of the gaps that are there.
    Dr. Light, let me start on the permitting process for the 
export terminals. Obviously, we have additional export 
terminals that are coming online, trying to increase additional 
capacity. What is our timeline to be able to increase our 
capacity for exporting LNG to Europe and those allies that are 
really interested in getting replacement gas at this point? How 
long will it take to increase that?
    Dr. Light. Thank you for the question, Senator. I would 
need to know what particular permit you are talking about.
    Senator Lankford. Yes, I am not looking for a specific one, 
I am just talking--because there is no specific company I am 
trying to pursue to say, can theirs go faster.
    Dr. Light. Yes, yes, sure.
    Senator Lankford. I am just trying to figure out how fast 
can we ramp-up, because this is not an instantaneous thing to 
say, well, let's just send more natural gas to be able to 
substitute.
    Dr. Light. Absolutely.
    Senator Lankford. We have natural gas, but it is the 
infrastructure to actually get it out and the terminals 
themselves to be able to permit, obviously, to make the 
decision that it's in our national interest.
    Dr. Light. Right.
    Senator Lankford. And I think that would be my first 
question. Is it in America's national interest for our allies 
to get more access to American gas?
    Dr. Light. Absolutely, yes.
    Senator Lankford. Okay, so then, how quickly could we ramp-
up over the next couple of years to increase capacity going to 
Europe?
    Dr. Light. So the Department is involved in a number of 
internal conversations to try to streamline the process, to try 
to look at what is in the pipeline in terms of applications and 
make sure that those move forward expeditiously. There is 
another problem that we are facing, which is that we have 
permitted much more capacity than we are actually currently 
seeing, that we are going to ramp-up 20 billion cubic feet per 
day permitted by the end of this decade. We have 29 that has 
already been permitted, but there isn't movement to construct, 
based on those permits yet. And so that is an additional 
problem, where we don't actually have to wait on the permitting 
process. It's really how do you make sure that you don't create 
this interminable gap and ledge where companies are not moving 
forward on permits that they already have. And that is 
something we are looking at as well.
    Senator Lankford. So is the focus on getting permits to say 
we will get you a permit to be able to do this, if you are 
actually going to do it? What is the emphasis there?
    Dr. Light. That is part of the calculus there, and we would 
be happy to work with your staff. It is my colleague, Brad 
Crabtree, who runs the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon 
Management, who is at the front line of that, but I am in 
constant conversations with him every day about this.
    Senator Lankford. Well, part of the issue for them is, they 
are always looking for long-term contracts, to say, okay, we 
actually spend the billions of dollars to be able to create 
this. Are we going to be able to get the long-term contracts to 
be able to actually do it? That will actually pay for it, 
obviously, to be able to recoup that cost on it. Is that what 
seems to be holding some of the companies back, is just the 
long-term contracting portion of it?
    Dr. Light. I think there is a concern there, and that is 
one of the reasons that President Biden and President von der 
Leyen created this U.S./EU gas task force last March, to try to 
actually drill down into that as one of the key things in order 
to create investment confidence into the future.
    Senator Lankford. Okay, we have had sections of the 
northeastern United States that have actually been purchasers 
of Russian gas, which has always been the most ironic thing to 
me, that the United States is a purchaser, long-term, of 
Russian gas, because we don't have the pipeline capacity to be 
able to get American--we have American gas not very far away 
from it, but you don't have the pipeline capability to actually 
get there.
    Where is that gas coming from now that is coming into the 
northern part of the United States, because we are not buying 
it from Russia anymore. Where are we getting it from?
    Dr. Light. I am--so this is sort of outside of my lane.
    Senator Lankford. Sorry.
    Dr. Light. So I don't know the answer. I will make sure I 
get it to you. I believe some of that is coming up from the 
Gulf and getting redirected, but I don't want to swear to that 
here. I think that, you know, one of the important things here, 
as we move forward on this as well, is to make sure that we 
have the cleanest, most competitive gas supply system in the 
world. Russia did not have that.
    Senator Lankford. Right.
    Dr. Light. It was not a transition fuel that they were 
selling to Europe and the rest of the world. The United States 
wants that to be a secured, decarbonized supply. That is 
something you and I have talked about before, and I really see 
that as the future there. But I will absolutely get you an 
answer back.
    Senator Lankford. Thank you. I appreciate that. And that is 
one of the issues for me is, we produce energy and our 
exploration cleaner than anyone else in the world, in the way 
that we do it, actually going to pursue the natural gas. And 
so, for me, there is an incentive to say, if we are going to do 
this as clean as possible, because we are going to need natural 
gas for decades and decades still in the future as we are 
transitioning to whatever that other fuel source will be in the 
day to be able to substitute for that consistent power source 
that natural gas is. We need to make sure it is coming from the 
cleanest possible production and exploration that we possibly 
can.
    Dr. Light. That's right. And I also think investment in 
abatement technologies as well.
    Senator Lankford. Right.
    Dr. Light. I mean, this is the way that we are going to 
make the world secure and decarbonize and solve all the 
problems together with respect to energy security, diversity of 
supply, and attending to our climate goals as well.
    Senator Lankford. Okay, I appreciate that. And I know I 
don't have a lot of time to be able to do this. Mr. Chairman, 
thank you for allowing me to be able to jump in and ask 
questions because this is a big issue--just a steady supply. We 
have, obviously, got a lot of natural gas companies here that 
are producing, that are hoping that they are actually helping 
support global peace, quite frankly, and not only American 
stability of our energy prices, but also ----
    The Chairman. And we have to have the pipelines to move 
them, right?
    Senator Lankford. We have to have the pipelines to move 
them. We have to have the export terminals to be able to get it 
there. They have got to be able to regasify on the other side 
as well. But it's also the contracting portion.
    The Chairman. Well, Senator, you are always welcome to come 
back anytime you want.
    Senator Lankford. Thank you.
    The Chairman. I appreciate it.
    Let me just finish up real quick. Dr. Light, if you want to 
talk about the IRA and the effect it's having and basically, my 
problem, as you know, is that that bill was designed to be 
energy secure. There is a basic, balanced approach, and I think 
a lot of people have been misled because--and honestly, the 
Administration has sold it as an environmental bill only, or 
they used that more to their base. And I have been very engaged 
with them, trying to change and be accurate.
    But as you see that bill, basically, for a ten-year period, 
the bill is designed to have the United States of America 
totally energy independent. That means we will produce more 
fossil, but we do it cleaner than anywhere in the world. So as 
we replace to our friends around the world, they are getting 
the cleanest extraction of gas and oil, and coal even, than 
anyplace else, and that helps the climate tremendously from 
relying on the dirtier areas of the world that produce and not 
with the environmental oversight such as methane capturing, 
carbon capture utilization, things of that sort.
    So if you can just speak briefly on that, and I am having a 
problem with the permitting too. We are slow on permitting. You 
know that. And we have got to speed that up in order to do the 
job.
    I don't know if you all understand that basically, all the 
people who want more renewables, more renewables--we tied the 
two together. Remember, there's not going to be any big 
movement on more wind out on the Gulf unless we are extracting 
gas and oil from the Gulf. There are not going to be large 
projects, as far as solar projects on BLM land, unless we are 
extracting the critical minerals that we need and other 
resources that we have. I don't know if they are really 
realizing they are inextricably connected. You can't do one 
without the other. That gives us a balanced approach. So all of 
us have reasons to want to decarbonize and be environmentally 
friendly and understand our responsibility. On the other hand, 
the risk that we take, and the dependency that we have and our 
allies have on what the abundance that we have that we can 
produce for at least the next decade, depends on us being 
accurate with that.
    So if you have any insight on that whatsoever, any 
comments.
    And then, Director, I am going to go to you, Director 
Jorgensen, to see your European comments on the IRA, which I 
know, with all of your friends sitting behind you, is going to 
be quite lively.
    Dr. Light. Thanks very much, Senator Manchin, and for your 
leadership in creating this astounding revolution, frankly, in 
energy legislation, the likes of which I don't think we have 
seen in the world before. This is our all-of-the-above energy 
strategy.
    The Chairman. Right.
    Dr. Light. It's the only way we are going to see a real 
transition to net-zero emissions in the world, in the energy 
sector, which is going to actually provide security of supply, 
and will not increase prices, which will not hurt consumers. We 
have got all across the board, all the chips are covered, from 
renewables, to nuclear, advanced nuclear, to abated carbon 
energy.
    The Chairman. I will say one thing, if I may interrupt you 
for one second. The whole reason we call it the Inflation 
Reduction Act--if we put more product in the market--pure 
economics. So you put more product in the market, you have 
better pricing. So you are helping the consumer. That was the 
reason for what we have done.
    Dr. Light. Exactly right. And it also attends to those 
over-the-horizon technologies.
    The Chairman. Yes.
    Dr. Light. Clean hydrogen, everything else.
    I have to say, sir, that I--that you have created--it is 
not only here in the United States where we have this vision, 
and now the resources to do that, and seriously move forward on 
it. Unstalling conversations about carbon capture and 
sequestration, making that a reality, finally, it has inspired 
the world. I was in Bangalore, India last week for the G20 
negotiations. I have to tell you that India is ready to move 
forward on green hydrogen and on carbon capture and 
sequestration in a way that they can scale up in a way that is 
amazing, if you look at over a billion people, then, you know, 
in an energy system that is using that, as well as, now they 
want to talk with us about SMRs.
    So that is coming from the capacity that has been created 
by this legislation. If you can see the United States 
partnering with countries like that, countries in Europe, you 
know, other countries around the world, that is where we are 
seeing an investment in new energy technology as important as 
the investment in, frankly, in military technology that we had 
before because it will really give these countries true 
independence and true security of supply.
    The Chairman. I appreciate it. I know you are hearing a 
good bit as you go around, too, and we have been hearing it, 
and now to hear from our dear friend, Ditte Jorgensen, on your 
perspective of this. And I have heard from your colleagues and 
we hear you loud and clear.
    So tell me how it's working, or not working, or 
challenging.
    Ms. Jorgensen. Thank you very much, Senator, for that 
opportunity.
    So the Inflation Reduction Act--there are two perspectives 
that I would like to draw out. Now, the first one is that it is 
welcome that the United States is investing in green 
technologies and clean technologies, investing in climate 
change. That is good in terms of technological developments, 
innovation. It can help lower costs. So that is a welcome 
overall direction that is closely aligned with what we are 
doing in the European Union. We welcome that partnership and 
look forward to continuing that partnership. And our President, 
Ursula von der Leyen, has very clearly welcomed that direction 
of the Inflation Reduction Act.
    At the same time, we are deeply concerned with some of the 
elements of the Inflation Reduction Act that are clearly 
discriminatory. There are domestic content requirements. There 
are requirements that will make it more difficult for Europe to 
attract investments, more difficult for Europe to stay 
competitive. If I put that into the wider context of the global 
energy crisis we are in and the current geopolitics, we are 
each other's most important trading partners. We are each 
other's most important investment partners. So we have an 
interest in both of our markets continuing to develop, to 
remain competitive, because that can help innovation, that can 
help energy security, that can help create the technologies 
that are necessary for the future.
    So I think our take on that is we need to work together to 
solve those concerns, and we welcome the engagement we have 
seen from the U.S. on this. We need to continue that work to 
find solutions to the outstanding concerns and to the 
discriminatory elements of the Inflation Reduction Act so that 
Europe can also remain competitive and our partnership can 
remain a fair and open one.
    The Chairman. Well, let me give you a little bit of insight 
as to how this all came about. It came about because we were 
not able to help our allies with the Ukraine war, what it 
created in the EU, and that was the purpose of having energy 
security here. I could not get this Administration to move in 
that direction because they were moving more toward just 
everything on the renewable end of it. Well, that is fine, and 
that is aspirational, but it is basically not reality. It is 
not what we needed. We needed hard fossil in order to replace, 
but we can do it cleaner and better.
    So we put more for carbon capture utilization. We went from 
$60 to $85. We went from $35 to $50 on utilization, and on 
sequestering we went to $85. So we really upped the ante to 
find the new technologies that we can, and that was the whole 
thing. We are just trying to mature the industry and all these 
new technologies.
    The difference of what we used--I have had a lot of my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle, especially on my side of 
the aisle, criticize me for not adapting to cap and trade or 
carbon pricing. And the reason I didn't do that, and the reason 
I thought it was wrong was because once that pricing gets 
absorbed into the market, there are no resources going toward 
finding the cure, or finding a new technology. So we 
incentivized it with the money we put toward this so that it 
will mature it quicker so that we can share with you all and 
the rest of the world that wants to get less carbon, but be 
able to be realistic and meet the needs of your energy. We did 
that.
    The other thing is, you all had a concern, and rightfully 
so, and I heard you all loud and clear concerning, basically, 
on when we said we are going to choose to secure our critical 
minerals from North America or from countries with free trade 
agreements. We need to expand that to our NATO allies. We 
understand that. We cannot be held captive, which we are right 
now, by Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, or countries that 
have nothing in common with our way of life and our desired 
governance and democracy and freedom.
    So those are the things we are concerned about. We can work 
through that. I think we are going to see Europe move in a 
competitive mode, competing, and that is what it's all about. 
That is what we have been so great at, all of us have been, in 
the things that we have done together. It is amazing what we 
have accomplished together since World War II. We can continue 
to go into the 21st century, and on to the 22nd century, if we 
do it together, and we understand that. The value of the free 
world is based on allies and relationships. It's not based on 
one superpower. We know we can't do it without you. We know 
that. And we are going to have to make sure that we all do this 
together, if you will.
    So I would hope that you will look at what we have done, 
not in retrospect of it harming or that it was intended to 
harm, especially our allies, our dearest allies, but it was 
basically to jump-start the technology that is going to be 
needed to take us into the future. But you are still going to 
have, you know, even the President said for ten years, but I 
think longer than that, we are going to be depending on fossil. 
So can we extract and utilize natural gas and capture all of 
our methane so there is no venting and no harm to the 
environment? Can we basically be able to develop hydrogen, 
which the technology has been around forever, and now be able 
to do it and do it cleaner than even blue hydrogen? We have got 
pink hydrogen. We have got green hydrogen. We can do it all. 
And every part of the world can benefit from this technology.
    And then, we have small modular reactors with molten salt 
cooling, and basically, you can take those up and down like a 
peaking plant. That is all coming on strong. We are going to, 
with the amount of money, because, if not, they have got a ten-
year window. They have never had a ten-year window in any 
government from the standpoint of giving you ten years of 
certainty that you have this pool of money to work out of, 
because it has always been a couple years and then another 
Administration or another philosophical ideology comes into 
play with a new Administration and things change. This one is 
locked in and funding is secured from the 15 percent minimum 
tax that we have on our largest corporations.
    So we think it was a win-win, but we want to share that, 
truly. I don't want anyone to think--and when you see something 
that is being hindering or that you think it has been an 
obstacle, just let us know, because I think you brought it to 
my attention. I appreciate it very much, and we are working 
now. We have been working with the Secretary of Treasury, Janet 
Yellen, to make sure that we are able to apply this properly.
    So hopefully you know that we value your friendship, your 
relationship, and most importantly the alliance that we have 
had--that the free world has basically profited by what we have 
been able to do for the last 60, 70 years. We intend to do it 
for a lot longer.
    So I want to thank all of you for joining us. Dr. Mikulska, 
thank you for making an effort to be here.
    And Dr. Light, as always, we appreciate having you and we 
are working with you on a piece of legislation that is going to 
give you the ability to do more of what you can do and what you 
need to do to help us be stronger with our allies and our 
friends around the world.
    And again, Director-General Jorgensen, thank you so much 
for the effort that you made to be here and how much you have 
added to this hearing. I appreciate it very much.
    Members will have until the close of business tomorrow to 
submit any additional questions for the record.
    The Committee stands adjourned.
