                       THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
                 Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:06 a.m. in 
Room SD-366, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Joe Manchin 
III, Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

    The Chairman. I want to begin the 118th Congress by 
welcoming our new members, especially our new member, Senator 
Hawley. He is not here yet, but when he does come we will 
officially do it again.
    We will be kicking off this year with a discussion of the 
Department of Energy's implementation of the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law--the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. 
I would like to welcome and thank David Turk, Deputy Secretary 
at the Department of Energy, for appearing before the Committee 
today.
    In 2021, Congress worked in a bipartisan way to enact the 
most significant federal investment in our nation's 
infrastructure in decades, including approximately $100 billion 
in this Committee's jurisdiction alone between the Interior and 
Energy Departments. This, combined with the energy security 
investments provided in the Inflation Reduction Act, will be 
game-changing for us to become more energy secure through the 
increased domestic production of energy in the cleanest ways 
possible, leading the world in innovation, and onshoring 
critical supply chains.
    This Committee considered 74 amendments and agreed to 48 
before reporting our portion of the bill with bipartisan 
support. Now that the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill has been a 
law for more than a year, we are here today to discuss how the 
Department of Energy is implementing the authorizations and $62 
billion that we provide them over the next five years. This 
bill marked a transformational investment in our energy future 
and will allow America to be more secure and lead the way on 
energy innovation for many years to come.
    The benefits of both the BIF and the IRA are already being 
felt across the country, including in my home State of West 
Virginia, where we have been very happy to have new investment 
announcements in recent months. The BIF funds demonstration and 
pilot projects through an all-of-the-above energy approach by 
allowing us to continue using our fossil fuel resources in the 
cleanest way possible through new investments in hydrogen and 
carbon capture technologies. And we double down on hydrogen and 
CCUS in the IRA with new and enhanced tax credits. It also 
drives new energy manufacturing investments to coal country to 
support communities where coal mines or coal plants have 
closed, both in my home state and in Senator Barrasso's home 
State of Wyoming. That will provide good jobs and new tax 
bases. The $62 billion appropriated to DOE through the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was one of the largest 
investments in the Department that they have ever seen. This 
works hand-in-hand with the Inflation Reduction Act to really 
boost American innovation, competitiveness, and security. So we 
have clearly given the Department of Energy a lot of work to 
do.
    Congress has spoken clearly over the last two years, 
between the Energy Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill, and 
the Inflation Reduction Act, that the United States has an all-
of-the-above energy policy that supports using all of our God-
given resources in the cleanest way possible. That is how we 
shore up energy security and achieve energy independence while 
also addressing climate change. It is my intention to make sure 
that these laws are implemented swiftly, effectively, and in 
line with that clear Congressional intent, which I can assure 
you, this Administration does not seem to want to do, but we 
are going to make sure they do it. For that reason, I am very 
glad that Deputy Secretary Turk has agreed to appear before us 
today for this important discussion.
    I just want to mention one last thing, unrelated to our 
hearing topic today: Gas--and I appropriately repeat--gas 
stoves have been in the news lately, and I have come out 
strongly against the Consumer Product Safety Commission 
pursuing any ban of gas stoves. In fact, I am introducing 
legislation today with Senator Cruz that would ensure that they 
don't, and am separately sending a letter to the Commission 
with Senator Lankford, seeking clarification about the 
Commission's sudden desire to conduct an RFI on gas stoves.
    Yesterday, DOE published its first ever efficiency standard 
for cooktops, including gas stoves. Now, I have always been a 
proponent of energy efficiency, but the draft rule proposes 
efficiency levels that DOE says, at the highest level, up to 96 
percent of gas stoves don't currently meet. I don't like where 
I think they are going with this and I can tell you one thing, 
they are not taking my gas stove out. My wife and I would both 
be upset. Now, I know DOE is required to write a rule on 
stovetop efficiencies, and that this is the beginning of this 
process, not a final rule. But in light of broader concerns 
about the Administration looking to find ways to push out 
natural gas, which basically the rest of the world wishes they 
had the abundant supply that we do, doesn't make any sense at 
all, it really doesn't. As I have said before, the Federal 
Government does not have any business telling American families 
how to cook their dinner. If there is technology down the road, 
and we transition into the new technology, that is fine. But 
basically, retrofitting or removing stoves that people have had 
for years is not going to happen.
    So I want to thank David for being here today and I 
appreciate you and we look forward to talking to you. And now I 
am going to go to my friend Senator Barrasso to give his 
opening statement.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING

    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks so much, Mr. Chairman. 
Thanks for your leadership of this Committee over the last 
Congress and for the productive partnership that we have shared 
and will continue to share. I am looking forward to working 
with you and all the members of the Committee again this year.
    I would like to welcome Senator Hawley, from the great 
State of Missouri. We are excited to have him as a member of 
the Committee, and I look forward to his continued advocacy for 
American energy. Sad to see Senator Marshall and Senator 
Lankford leave the Committee. We owe both of them thanks for 
the work they did in advancing American energy.
    Mr. Chairman, thanks for holding today's hearing. It was in 
November 2021, Congress passed the $415 billion spending bill, 
and the Congressional Budget Office said that the legislation 
is going to increase our nation's deficit by $256 billion over 
the next ten years. Under this legislation, Congress approved 
over $62 billion to the Department of Energy. Now, that amount 
is in addition to the Department's annual appropriation of 
roughly $40 billion. So on top of these sums, Democrats in 
Congress gave another $35 billion to the Department in their 
Inflation Act. That amount of money that the Department has 
received over the last two years is staggering. So the question 
is not whether the Department is going to waste taxpayer 
dollars, but how to reduce the amount that it will waste. And 
for that reason, I am glad to have the Deputy Secretary here 
today. I supported his nomination. He came out of this 
Committee unanimously. We appreciate the work you are doing and 
we all are interested in learning what, if any, new controls or 
protocols the Department has put in place to reduce any of the 
waste, fraud, and abuse that is likely to come with that kind 
of money being spent.
    Last year, the Department's Inspector General wrote this 
Committee, and she explained that she does not have sufficient 
resources at the Department to monitor the amount of money that 
is now flying out of the Department's doors. She stated--this 
is the Department's own Inspector General--stated that she 
``anticipates substantial losses due to fraud, waste, and 
abuse, in part because the law expands programs with a history 
of serious problems.'' So I would note that the legislation 
provided nearly $100 million for the Department of the 
Interior's Inspector General, but it provided only about half 
the amount for the Department of Energy's Inspector General. 
This seems reckless, given that the Infrastructure Act 
appropriated more than twice the amount to the Department of 
Energy than it appropriated to the Department of the Interior. 
So I would like to know whether Mr. Turk would support 
redirecting some of the existing appropriations to the Office 
of the Inspector General within the Department of Energy.
    I am also interested to learn what, if any, new controls 
and protocols the Department has put in place to ensure the 
legislation does not fund our nation's adversaries, like China. 
One program is already raising concerns. Last year, the 
Department of Energy provided a $200 million grant to a battery 
manufacturer called Microvast. This company's filings with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission reveal very troubling 
connections to the Communist Chinese government. One filing 
states that ``the People's Republic of China exerts substantial 
influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business 
activities and may intervene at any time and with no notice.'' 
The company goes on to state, ``we may not be able to protect 
our intellectual property rights in the PRC.'' Supporters of 
the legislation said it would help increase America's 
competitiveness. Now we know the Department has funneled 
hundreds of millions of dollars to a company that publicly 
admits it is at the beck and call of the Chinese government. In 
December 2022, I wrote to Secretary Granholm asking her for 
information about the Department's review process for grants. 
The Secretary has not yet responded, and I know that perhaps 
she will respond today.
    Finally, I would like the Deputy Secretary to pledge that 
funds from the Infrastructure Act won't be used to ban or 
restrict the use of natural gas in new buildings. Senator 
Manchin already asked the question and raised the issue of 
natural gas in cookstoves. In 2021, I warned that this 
legislation would allow the Secretary to finance entities that 
seek to ban the use of natural gas in new buildings. I have 
offered an amendment to stop this. All ten Democrats on this 
Committee voted against that amendment in the past. They said 
it wasn't an issue. Thanks to Commissioner Trumka, that mask 
has slipped. We now know that the Biden Administration is 
seeking to restrict the use of natural gas in new buildings. We 
can't let that happen. So I look forward, Mr. Chairman, Mr. 
Deputy Secretary, to your testimony.
    Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thanks, Senator Barrasso.
    And now we are going to turn to Deputy Secretary Turk for 
your statement, sir.

               STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID M. TURK, 
          DEPUTY SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

    Mr. Turk. Well, thank you very much, Chairman Manchin, 
Ranking Member Barrasso, Senator Cantwell, Senator Cassidy, 
Senator Cortez Masto, and I know we will have several others 
come as well. Thanks for this opportunity to provide you all an 
update on the Department of Energy's implementation of the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
    The bill, just as you said, Chairman, truly is a historic 
investment in renewing American infrastructure, not just for 
this year or next year, but for decades to come. We are, 
together, rebuilding American manufacturing and increasing 
American competitiveness. We are creating millions of lasting, 
good-paying jobs all across our country, and at the same time, 
we are reducing energy costs for our fellow Americans, 
improving our energy security, promoting energy justice, and 
tackling climate change head-on. The bill is also the 
culmination of years and years of this Committee's excellent 
work, including the critical bipartisan Energy Act of 2020, and 
I want to particularly call out the Senators and your staffs 
for all your phenomenal work, for all the provisions that are 
in the bill. On behalf of our entire Department, let me thank 
you sincerely for all of your leadership and partnership.
    Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we have 
investments, as the Chairman mentioned, of more than $62 
billion for the Department of Energy to administer. The bill 
launches 60 new programs--6-0--new programs and enhances 12 
other programs. Of the $62 billion, nearly 90 percent of this 
funding is directed toward these new programs, just to give you 
a sense of the opportunity and the scale of responsibility in 
our Department. In the 14 months since President Biden signed 
the bill into law, DOE has been working with a real sense of 
urgency. We already have $37 billion of that $62 billion 
available so communities across our country can benefit as 
quickly as they possibly can.
    We are also wanting to do this right. We have completed a 
major realignment of the Department to ensure maximum impact, 
but also, oversight and integrity. And I am certainly happy, 
Senator Barrasso and others, to get into details of what we 
have put in place to make sure we are doing this right. We have 
hired now more than 400 new staff, with many of those being 
contracting experts and others who can help on the oversight 
and the integrity of the process. We are also working hand-in-
hand with our Inspector General, as you mentioned, Senator 
Barrasso. I have spoken many times with Teri Donaldson and we 
are supportive of budget increases for her office.
    Let me just give you a few highlights of our work so far, 
and of course, I am happy to get into any of these in detail. 
The bill provides historic funding and support for hydrogen, I 
know an issue of interest for many members on this Committee. 
We developed a National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap. We 
have made $7 billion available so far for Regional Clean 
Hydrogen Hubs, I know of interest to many of you at the dais. 
And we have issued announcements for another $750 million for 
electrolyzer manufacturing research and demonstrations to build 
out that critical capability in our country.
    We have issued funding announcements for game-changing 
carbon management programs--$2.25 billion for carbon storage 
validation and testing, $2 billion for carbon dioxide 
transportation projects, and $1.2 billion for Regional Direct 
Air Capture Hubs. You put that together with the 45Q 
enhancements and that is a powerful recipe for CCUS really 
taking off in our country. $3.9 billion, so far, has been made 
available to modernize our electric grid, $3 billion for 
weatherization and energy efficiency in homes and businesses, 
driving down costs for consumers across our country, $2.8 
billion for battery materials processing and component 
manufacturing across 12 states, creating more than 5,000 
permanent jobs. In fact, since the President took office, the 
U.S. has seen over $92 billion of public and private investment 
in new and expanded battery manufacturing operations. That is 
an awful lot of good jobs--manufacturing heft across our 
country.
    And we have created a new Office of State and Community 
Energy Programs--SCEP is the acronym, which is a terrible 
acronym, I will admit, but we have a lot of those terrible 
acronyms at DOE. The SCEP Office will ensure our infrastructure 
build-out is driven by and benefiting communities across our 
country. Not all knowledge, in fact, maybe not that much is in 
DC. We need to listen to communities about what we can do to 
help support them across the country with this funding. As a 
preview of coming attractions, we will be announcing very soon 
something I am particularly excited about. It is a billion 
dollars that you all funded for implementing community-driven 
energy projects across rural and remote America. And I could go 
on and on.
    The Department of Energy looks forward to the continued 
guidance of this Committee as we implement the bill and take on 
this enormous responsibility. This law provides an unparalleled 
and catalytic investment in our nation's infrastructure in 
energy security, and the Department looks forward to working 
hand-in-hand with all of you to meet this moment. Chairman 
Manchin, Ranking Member Barrasso, members of this Committee, 
thank you again for entrusting the Department of Energy with 
this historic responsibility--and I use that word very 
purposefully--to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, 
and I look forward to answering all your questions in this 
session and in the coming days and weeks. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Turk follows:]
   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Turk.
    I will start the questioning now, and my first question, 
sir, would be concerning the EV battery supply chain. I don't 
think there is any secret here about my concerns, along with a 
lot of my colleagues, on the absolute capture that China has on 
this market, and how we break that. But I understand that there 
are concerns about a company called Microvast that was awarded 
a grant through the infrastructure law's battery grant program, 
and what ties that company has to China. I know that Microvast 
also received an award from the Trump Administration. So I am 
hoping that you can alleviate some concerns we have about this 
particular company, and more globally, DOE's process for 
vetting applicants to ensure that we are not giving our best 
ideas to China and funding them to be able to take advantage of 
it in their marketplace along with ours.
    So if you can explain the vetting process and what you know 
about this company and what you are doing to make sure that it 
is not going in the wrong direction.
    Mr. Turk. Well, thanks for the question, Chairman, and I 
know, Senator Barrasso, you are interested in this and we just 
responded to your letter on this, that you should have in your 
in-box as well.
    So first of all, I think we have to acknowledge, and 
Chairman, you have said this many times, more eloquently than I 
could possibly. Our country--and I put all of us in that 
category--has fallen asleep at the switch with some of these 
key critical technologies--battery manufacturing, solar PV. The 
vast majority of that, right now, is produced in China and it 
is not just the mining piece, in fact, what China really has a 
stranglehold on now is processing and all those intermediate 
steps. So we are in a hole right now. I feel incredibly proud 
to be a part of a Department of Energy that has been given 
tools in our tool belt to really get our act together and to 
have a proactive, robust strategy to onshore, to re-shore, and 
to reassert U.S. leadership. So, just as kind of a backdrop of 
where we are coming from.
    The Chairman. Let me just say one other thing, if I may. I 
am concerned with the geopolitical risk that this 
Administration is not concerned with right now by trying to 
push more EVs out before we are able to supply the batteries 
without dependence on China. That is the biggest concern I 
have, and the recent ruling from Treasury, that still allows 
$7,500 credits and just completely violates the IRA by delaying 
the necessary guidance that they were supposed to have in place 
by December 31. They have avoided that, and cherry-picked it, 
and they are still paying $7,500. It's just ridiculous what's 
going on, and we are pushing EVs to the point that we are going 
to continue to rely on China for supply of these batteries. 
That is the problem.
    Mr. Turk. Well, let me make a point on the EVs and then get 
into the Microvast and the process that we have in place on 
that front.
    The Chairman. Sure.
    Mr. Turk. And of course, we are providing technical help 
and expertise to our Treasury colleagues and conversations to 
try to help move that process along, but it is not a process, 
of course, that we control. What we do have are the tools that 
you have given us through the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
legislation to move out as quickly as we possibly can in 
reshoring, asserting this U.S. leadership, doing it as 
strategically robust and as urgently as we possibly can, so we 
are not in the hole that we are currently. We have got to dig 
ourselves out of that hole as quickly as we possibly can.
    As I mentioned in my opening, the vast majority of our bill 
grants are competitive. And these are administered by civil 
servants. They are done that way for a reason--to ensure 
integrity in the process, to ensure fairness in the process. 
There is an extensive merit review process where we get experts 
who know the industry and provide guidance where we have these 
competitive grants before us. We are continually improving that 
process to make sure all our civil servants have the 
geostrategic perspective of what we are trying to do here, just 
as you said, Chairman. We also have a robust process where we 
get intelligence officials to be part of that process in making 
sure that we have all publicly available information as well as 
privately available information through our extensive 
intelligence channels. And we are also purposely taking 
advantage of expertise that we have in the Department. Those of 
you who are familiar with the CFIUS process that we have been 
working on for many, many years--we have got expertise 
available to help us interpret that intelligence information 
and make sure that we are being smart, eyes-wide-open, in terms 
of what we do going forward.
    The Chairman. So I am going to tell the clerk we will go to 
seven minutes, okay, until we have more members so it would not 
cut you all short. If you can keep your answers with us short.
    Mr. Turk. Yes, I know this is an issue----
    The Chairman. Just tell me about Microvast.
    Mr. Turk. This is an issue of interest. The other thing I 
will say is a general rule, but these are specific restrictions 
that we have in place. Every applicant, not just for the 
battery manufacturing one that we are talking about here, the 
$2.8 billion, but every one of ours, every applicant has to be 
a domestic entity incorporated in the U.S. with a majority 
domestic ownership in control and have a physical place of 
residence in the U.S.
    The Chairman. You know about our concern with China and the 
economic war I think they are going to wage on us if they 
haven't already started. Are you looking at, basically, any 
ties whatsoever? Because they have ways of camouflaging 
minority ownership.
    Mr. Turk. So we absolutely do, and we are doing it eyes-
wide-open on this. The other specific requirement I wanted to 
point out, again, for this grant, but other grants as well is, 
any persons participating--and this is particularly relevant to 
China, but not just China--in a foreign government-sponsored 
talent recruitment program--and I think many of you have heard 
those words before--are prohibited from participating in 
projects selected for federal funding, so another specific 
piece.
    So Microvast, in particular, was selected--and this is 
important, where it is at in the process--it was selected to 
negotiate an award. There are no taxpayer funds going to 
Microvast or any of the other 20 companies right now. They were 
selected to participate in a negotiation for an award. What 
that----
    The Chairman. Got you. Let me just----
    Mr. Turk [continuing]. Triggers for us is an extended due 
diligence process where we look in and we also verify all the 
accuracy of the information----
    The Chairman. I am going to jump to another subject right 
now.
    The $12 billion projects that deploy carbon capture at a 
commercial scale, okay? We know that CCUS is going to be 
necessary for us to meet our targets, our goals, as far as 
emissions reductions. This Administration continues to wage war 
on coal. They can say what they want to, but I am from coal 
country so I know what's happening. The wells that we are 
talking about require a Class VI permit from EPA. We had $12 
billion to deploy carbon capture at a commercial scale, the 
infrastructure bill provides the EPA $75 million for Class VI 
well permitting, including providing grants to states that take 
over the responsibility for permitting these wells. However, 
only two active Class VI wells have ever been permitted, and at 
least 30 applications are pending at the EPA. What is that 
going to do to meet the timetables that we have?
    Mr. Turk. So, as I said, we have a phenomenal opportunity 
on CCUS and the tools that you have given us.
    The Chairman. Yes, but not the way they are moving.
    Mr. Turk. What we are trying to do at DOE, and Senator 
Cassidy and I were just talking a little bit about this before 
the hearing began, we are trying to work with EPA. I have had 
several conversations with my counterpart.
    The Chairman. We are going to bring them in here too, if 
you all want. Okay, we are bringing EPA here too.
    Mr. Turk. I have had several conversations with my 
counterpart, Senator, Deputy Secretary McCabe. We are engaged 
right now with them on technical----
    The Chairman. Well, you know the problems that we are 
dealing with here, and we are never going to meet what we need 
to do with carbon capture because of the permitting process----
    Mr. Turk. We understand the urgency. We are trying to work 
with our interagency colleagues and are doing everything we can 
from our end.
    The Chairman. With that, I apologize.
    Senator Barrasso, your questions.
    Senator Barrasso. Thanks so much, Mr. Chairman. Thanks, Mr. 
Turk.
    You know, in commenting on the Infrastructure Act, the 
Office of Inspector General, Department of Energy, has said 
that, ``History is clear: when money moves quickly, so does 
waste, fraud, and abuse.'' So the question I have is, is the 
Department taking enough time to review the grants to reduce 
the chance of waste, fraud, and abuse?
    Mr. Turk. So we are certainly moving urgently because 
communities need this help, but we are also trying to do this 
right. And with the IG we are not only trying to support the 
funding for our IG on the back end, but we are in extensive 
conversations with the IG, with her team, to hear any lessons 
learned that they have about setting up these new offices, 
these new programs in the right way. We are spending an awful 
lot of time in due diligence on that.
    Senator Barrasso. There does seem to be a value to set 
those programs up before money starts going out the door.
    Mr. Turk. So we are in the position of trying to move 
urgently and doing it right. And so we take both of those 
responsibilities very seriously, but we appreciate that $62 
billion is an awful lot of money. I came from a pretty humble 
background. That is a lot of money.
    The Chairman. A lot of zeros.
    Mr. Turk. And we are trying to make sure we leverage that 
as best as we can.
    Senator Barrasso. As I mentioned in my earlier statement, 
the Department has awarded this $200 million grant to 
Microvast. The Chairman mentioned it as well. In its filings 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company 
states, and it is right here on the board behind me, that it is 
under the substantial influence--the substantial influence--of 
the People's Republic of China, the PRC. It goes on to say, 
``our success depends on our ability to obtain, maintain, and 
protect our intellectual property rights.'' The very next 
sentence, ``we may not be able to protect our intellectual 
property rights in the PRC [the People's Republic of China].''
    [The poster with the aforementioned quotes follows:]
    [GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Barrasso. So the term PRC--this is the SEC filing, 
there is a lot to it--the term PRC is mentioned 471 times in 
the company's filings. The term China is mentioned 110 times in 
the company's filings. So you know, how did the Department let 
this happen? Did the Department rush the process? I know this 
is long, but did anyone at DOE actually do their homework? Do 
you know if anyone actually bothered to read this?
    Mr. Turk. So again, we are in the stage right now, again, 
no taxpayer funding is going to any of these companies yet. We 
are doing a due diligence review. We are making sure that 
everything that was included in the application was truly 
represented, any awardee, any potential awardee, that is the 
responsibility that they have on that end. As a broader 
perspective, one thing--we are in a hole right now. 
Unfortunately, most of--in fact, the vast majority of battery 
manufacturing is in China right now. And a lot of that IP is in 
China right now. And so we have to have an eyes-wide-open 
strategy, spending taxpayer funding in the way that we all 
would want taxpayer funding to be spent, reasserting our 
leadership, and trying to bring as much of that, as quickly as 
we can, to Chairman Manchin's point, here in the U.S. And that 
is what we are trying to do.
    Senator Barrasso. I mentioned the letter and then you said 
it would be in my inbox. It has come in. It was dated 
yesterday, arrived today, on taking some of these selections 
for something like this. The letter says that we do a thorough 
post-selection, risk-based due diligence review--after 
selection. It makes you wonder why we don't make those 
decisions before, as opposed to after the decision. Why 
wouldn't we assess the risk before making a grant decision 
about something like this?
    Mr. Turk. So our goal is to be thorough and diligent 
throughout the process, just to be incredibly clear. Certainly 
before we spend any taxpayer money we go through a due 
diligence process with these companies that were selected and 
negotiate an award and do it again, and make sure we are being 
diligent on that process. And again, making sure that our 
intelligence colleagues are part of the process, our other 
colleagues who have worked on these issues for years and years. 
So we do this eyes-wide-open, looking for our strategic 
interests.
    Senator Barrasso. And I would just suggest that eyes-wide-
open would have been before making the selection, before making 
the decision when you have this, to this level and this kind of 
a history.
    I want to move on to something that the Chairman also 
mentioned, which were gas stoves. Last month, in an interview 
with Bloomberg, Richard Trumka, Commissioner for the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission, said that any options are on the 
table, products that cannot be made safe can be banned. In 
response, the White House said the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission is not banning gas stoves. Secretary Granholm called 
the story ridiculous and not true, she said. Well, I have 
obtained the memo from October 25, 2022 from Commissioner 
Trumka. Notice for proposal, ban on gas stoves--ban on gas 
stoves. Here it is. This is the Administration.
    [The memo referred to follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Barrasso. First sentence of this: ``The need for 
gas stove regulation has reached a boiling point.'' I would say 
what has reached a boiling point is anger against the Biden 
Administration's insanity of proposing to ban gas stoves. It is 
astonishing.
    So who is lying? Is Mr. Trumka lying? Is the White House 
lying? Is the Secretary lying? Because they are saying very 
different things.
    Mr. Turk. Let me be very clear, and the White House has 
been clear on this. The President does not support banning gas 
stoves. The Department of Energy does not support banning gas 
stoves. We do efficiency regulations for all sorts of 
appliances, household appliances. We have some pending right 
now, some for electric stoves and gas stoves. We treat those 
separately. And what I am told--and we need to make sure that 
we are not talking past each other, Chairman, the nugget that 
you referenced--what I am told is that these rules that would 
come into effect in 2027, every major manufacturer already has 
models, gas stove models that meet or exceed the level that we 
are proposing for 2027.
    So again, we are talking past each other. Let's figure that 
out and make sure that we know what we are dealing with here.
    Senator Barrasso. And my last question--the Infrastructure 
Act included $6 billion for a credit program to prevent 
existing nuclear reactors from closing prematurely. Since the 
enactment of the bill, existing reactors become eligible for a 
production tax credit. The tax credit is more than sufficient 
to address the economic needs of the existing reactors. These 
same reactors are now facing a new challenge, a different 
challenge, and that is eliminating their dependency on Russian 
uranium. Now, I believe a portion of the $6 billion should be 
used to ensure the availability of U.S. nuclear fuel rather 
than continuing to be dependent on Russia. America's nuclear 
utilities agree. Do you support redirecting a portion of this 
funding to ensure that we can supply our existing and advanced 
reactors with U.S.-produced nuclear fuel?
    Mr. Turk. So we support both taking care of our existing 
reactors and we support a very robust, aggressive uranium 
strategy for low-enriched uranium and HALEU. And thank you, 
Senator, for your leadership on this issue for many, many 
years.
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I just ask, 
finally, unanimous consent to put this SEC filing in the 
record.
    The Chairman. Without objection.
    [Microvast SEC filing of December 14, 2021 follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    The Chairman. Senator Cantwell.
    Thank you, Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Deputy Secretary Turk, thank you for your statement this 
morning and for the agency's leadership in implementing these 
important pieces of legislation. I think you captured it 
correctly, we are making a record level of investment in the 
United States to unleash an unprecedented level of private-
sector investment so we can win the innovation and opportunity 
war, I guess, of the future, and to also make our grid more 
secure. And while we hear a lot of different things here this 
morning, the bottom line is, I know you were intimately 
involved in the aftermath of the Colonial Pipeline, so I know 
that you have been on the front lines of this fight. And so, 
this is about strengthening both our resiliency and building a 
system that makes the United States economy more secure. So I 
appreciate your leadership on that.
    One thing I wanted to ask about--we were able to author and 
include the $2.5 billion transmission facilitation program as 
part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill. So that helps 
support the establishment of microgrids and updating 
transmission lines. And we also--through the forthcoming anchor 
tenant contract aspect of this--try to make sure that we are 
enabling the kinds of development that we think are so 
essential for a more secure, smarter grid. And that is 
everything on fire and helping us with more intelligent 
responses to fire. It is helping us with, as I said, on moving 
energy around more effectively. So the deadline for those 
proposals was just yesterday, February 1st. Can you share any 
initial assessment, and do you anticipate a second round of 
those RFPs in 2023?
    Mr. Turk. Well, thank you, Senator. Let me thank you for 
your leadership, not only for that particular provision--your 
focus on grids and transmission for many, many years, but also 
your leadership in the Science Committee as well. As we are 
deploying and demonstrating, we have to keep our eye on 
innovation in science and our national labs, and you have just 
been a phenomenal leader. So I just want to appreciate that.
    This transmission facilitation program, $2.5 billion, this 
is a big, big deal. I am not sure people appreciate how 
important this is as part of the overall package of what we are 
doing. Part I did close just yesterday and we are moving into 
Part II. I am very pleased with how things are moving along 
with that program and happy to get into depth as helpful as 
appropriate going forward, but----
    Senator Cantwell. So you think there will be a second 
round?
    Mr. Turk. There will be a second phase of this. A lot of 
what we are doing here to try to make sure we are spending this 
money as wisely as we possibly can is having a part one and a 
part two, similar to what we are doing on the hydrogen hubs, 
where we have a concept paper and then ask for much more 
fleshed-out information. We are trying to move deliberately 
along those lines.
    Senator Cantwell. Okay. So you just don't know if that is 
2023 or not, is what you are saying.
    Mr. Turk. We will move as quickly as we can, but again, 
doing it right.
    Senator Cantwell. Right. I appreciate that. I am just 
trying to get a picture of----
    Mr. Turk. Yes.
    Senator Cantwell [continuing]. How we are doing on that. 
But you like the projects, so that is important and I mean, are 
you seeing quality investments is, I guess, my question.
    Mr. Turk. We are seeing quality investments, and the need 
here is just immense. One data nugget for this, and the 
importance of transmission--and I know you understand this, 
Senator, and I think a lot of your colleagues do as well--all 
of the climate benefits that we get out of the bill and the 
Inflation Reduction Act, if we can't improve the rate of 
transmission build-out in our country, we lose 80 percent of 
those climate benefits. So just to underscore how important 
transmission is, and this program in particular.
    Senator Cantwell. Exactly. Thank you for making that point. 
That is exactly why we did it because the transformation needs 
to include the grid. And if you don't make the grid smarter, 
more capable, you are not going to be able to implement any of 
it.
    Mr. Turk. Absolutely.
    Senator Cantwell. So you can't spend the money on electric 
vehicles and then not have a grid that is capable of the 
intelligence required.
    Okay, let me turn to hydrogen. You know, one of the 
provisions there in the bill was how can we accelerate the use 
of hydrogen, both as an energy storage medium and to power 
transportation, and it's particularly certain more in areas 
that are difficult to decarbonize. And one of the provisions 
was to produce and deploy benefits from green hydrogen. So on 
the production side, our region is obviously blessed with 
abundant carbon-free hydropower, and we already have several, 
what I would call hydrogen fuel production facilities, and more 
are in development, and I wanted to hear what you are thinking 
as it relates to--I mean, this is so important for us in the 
Northwest because we are already a big transportation area, so 
you know, we want a robust freight network. We want our 
maritime ports, you know, these applications, we continue to be 
a big driver. The agricultural sector alone, on driving down 
fertilizer cost, a key issue.
    The infrastructure bill included $8 billion to establish 
Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs. And one, at least, that is 
produced from renewable energy. So what are you guys thinking? 
What should applicants be thinking about as it relates to this 
particular program? Can you describe how the Department is 
thinking about this issue?
    Mr. Turk. Yes, happy to do it, and just as you said, the 
opportunity space here for us on hydrogen, whether it is in the 
Northwest or Louisiana or many parts of our country, is just 
huge, and this can be part of not only our solution here in the 
U.S. to decarbonize hard-to-decarbonize sectors, but there is 
also a global race going on right now to develop hydrogen 
technologies and to be the manufacturing hub of the world for 
these technologies as well. So as I mentioned in my opening, we 
have a phenomenal opportunity in front of us, the $8 billion in 
hydrogen hubs, $7 billion of which we have in a first tranche. 
We had proposals from all across the country and what we 
decided to do there is have a shorter concept paper, and now we 
are in the stage of encouraging 33 of those applications, and 
we discouraged an additional 46 of those applications to try to 
give them an early signal before too much work is done that 
this is meeting the criteria to get the most out of this money 
as part of the overall hydrogen solution.
    We now are going over those more detailed applications. 
April 7th is when those are due, and we will be able to fully 
look at those, and we are going to get the funding out by the 
end of this year. So we are moving quite quickly on that front. 
But that is just one part of our hydrogen strategy. We have 
$750 million in green hydrogen, which is very much part of that 
$7 billion. We also have the $750 million to drive the cost 
down of electrolyzers, which are what make green hydrogen work. 
And we have incredibly potent tax incentives for hydrogen, 
especially green hydrogen production. That is part of the 
Treasury tax regulations. All of these things work together.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you. I know I am out of time, Mr. 
Chairman, but if I could just get further--I will follow up 
with you, but I want to talk to you about the Advanced Nuclear 
Demonstration Program, particularly in our state. So thank you 
so much.
    And I will just say, WSU, Washington State University, is 
doing great work on hydrogen. It is amazing what we are going 
to unleash. So thank you.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Cassidy.
    Senator Cassidy. Thank you, Mr. Turk.
    Mr. Turk, when one of your coworkers, Mr. Crane, was here, 
he and I spoke about the DOE's proposed definition of clean 
hydrogen that would change the legislative definition from two 
kilograms of CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen 
produced at the point of production to a life cycle requirement 
of four kilograms of CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent per kilogram of 
hydrogen. Now we are told that an all-natural gas grid would be 
counted in the life cycle analysis, but that an all-renewable 
grid would not be required to take into account the mining, 
refining, and manufacturing that went into developing that 
renewable grid life cycle analysis. We are also told that small 
producers of natural gas, who have received no compensation in 
the hub, would nonetheless be considered contributors to the 
life cycle analysis. This really seems like a thumb on the 
scale, again, against natural gas--this, kind of, war on fossil 
fuel the Administration seems to pursue.
    Now, just let me ask. Where are we with this? And have we 
modified those definitions that go against that which was 
legislated?
    Mr. Turk. Well, thank you, Senator, for your leadership on 
hydrogen and CCUS and a variety of other key technologies for 
your state and for our country. You are referring to the 
production standard, which is trying to take a beyond-the-
fence-line life cycle analysis, making sure that we take into 
account all the emissions associated with it. That is not a 
regulatory standard and that is not a barrier to any applicant, 
whether it is the hydrogen hubs or otherwise. And so we are 
trying to be true to the legislative intent and trying to make 
sure that with all of our funding, we are taking into account 
the full range of emissions and being smart, smart about that--
--
    Senator Cassidy. Now, but let me ask. When you said full 
range, you are not including the life cycle of the renewable 
grid and you are talking about solar and you are talking the 
mining of lithium, the transportation of it, typically from 
Asia, et cetera, et cetera. It's pretty dirty, actually.
    Mr. Turk. So we need to take into account all of these----
    Senator Cassidy. So is it? So I know you need to, but is 
your current life cycle analysis still taking into account the 
upstream on natural gas, if it is a natural gas fired plant, 
and not taking into account the mining associated with lithium, 
et cetera, to develop that solar panel farm?
    Mr. Turk. So let me talk further. You mentioned David 
Crane. Brad Crabtree is our colleague in charge of our Fossil 
Energy and Carbon Management office as well. Our life cycle 
analysis should be life cycle analysis and take into account 
all the emissions throughout the life cycle.
    Senator Cassidy. And so, again, I don't mean to drill, but 
``it should''--that is a subjunctive. Is it?
    Mr. Turk. That is what I need to talk to our colleagues on.
    Senator Cassidy. And is it still taking into account the 
small producer of natural gas who has no relationship 
whatsoever to the hub, and yet we were told previously that 
whatever the profile would be of that, would go into an 
industry average as to the production of natural gas.
    Mr. Turk. Well, we appreciate your continued guidance and 
feedback on the hubs. We were trying to do this in the right 
way to solicit information, to make sure that what we are 
looking at, the criteria that we are looking at, we certainly 
are being very solicitous, rightfully so, of not just looking 
out for the big players, but also----
    Senator Cassidy. But that is beside my point because I 
don't--you mentioned earlier we are talking past each other. 
Right now we are told that on the average emission profile of 
the natural gas that will go to the natural gas-fired plant, 
they have taken into account the smaller producers, which may 
have not as good a profile. They are lumping it into an 
average, so the folks that really care about this are not at an 
advantage. In fact, they are being disadvantaged by including 
those who, for whatever reason, may not have the same positive 
profile. So again, I am asking specifically, does the current 
rule still include those small producers in an industry average 
when taking into account the life cycle profile?
    Mr. Turk. So let me take that back with my colleagues, and 
I am happy to have further conversations with you, Senator. I 
don't know the current state on that particular nuance. So I am 
happy to take that back.
    Senator Cassidy. Sounds good. And I appreciate you coming 
back with that.
    Now, let me move on, kind of echoing what some of my 
colleagues have spoken about. The issue of how do we--you 
mentioned you have these different proposals for hydrogen hubs. 
And in blue hydrogen we need to sequester that carbon. 
Louisiana has worked incredibly hard, and collaborated with 
Oklahoma and Arkansas to put together a proposal. Now, on the 
blue hydrogen aspect of it, obviously, you sequester the 
carbon. Louisiana cannot get primacy. We are told that our 
application is actually being referred to as a model as to how 
to get primacy when other states come and say, okay, what 
format should we use? And we are told, and all due respect to 
my Ranking Member, Wyoming, which is the only state, I 
understand, or maybe one of two, that has gotten primacy, that 
ours written a few years after meets more concerns of the 
Federal Government. Theirs was good, ours is better. And we 
still can't get it. It has been held up for, I think, years 
now.
    And so, if we are going to achieve these goals with all 
these great, kind of, ``oh my gosh, don't we want to do it,'' 
and we can't get primacy. I feel like quoting Pogo--``we have 
met the enemy and he is us,'' except in this case, it is the 
Federal Government. So what can DOE do to actually move from 
``yes, we really want it to happen,'' to ``yes, it has 
happened.''
    Mr. Turk. So we have a phenomenal opportunity on CCUS. 
Thank you for the tools in our tool belt at DOE. We have got 
the tax credit, which I think is going to be a game-changer, 
and the 45Q enhancement as well. And we are trying to do 
whatever we can with our EPA colleagues. I have had several 
conversations. We have teams of ours working with EPA 
colleagues, trying to inform their decision-making process and 
we are certainly happy to continue that----
    Senator Cassidy. But can the EPA stop this by themselves? 
Is there no one over at the EPA that says, listen, you were 
supposed to give us the decision a year ago last October and 
yet, now we are still past October, not to mention past a year 
ago October, and we still don't know when it is going to 
happen?
    Mr. Turk. So I am happy to talk about this with our White 
House colleagues as well and try to make some progress and 
understand the urgency of what you are saying. And we need to 
make sure--whether it is permitting more generally or Class VI 
wells--we need to make sure all parts of the equation are in 
place so that we can move forward aggressively and ambitiously. 
I Certainly take your point on that.
    Senator Cassidy. I will finish by saying this: Part of the 
goal of the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill is to leverage 
private dollars. It was a lot of money but it is going to 
unleash a lot more. One thing that lot more needs is certainty. 
And the only thing they are getting right now is uncertainty. 
So if the Administration actually wants to trigger this, and 
the President really wants to be known for being an 
environmental President, then we have got to unleash that 
capital, and it will not, as long as they continue just to kind 
of mess with people.
    Mr. Turk. Point incredibly well taken. I think this is why 
the tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act are so 
important. Those are ten-year tax incentives. There is a lot 
more window of certainty. There is a lot more planning horizon 
out there. But I certainly take your point. We have got to have 
all parts of the equation moving forward so that we have 
certainty across the front for private-sector developers.
    Senator Cassidy. Thank you, sir.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Now we have Senator Cortez Masto.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    Deputy Secretary, it is great to see you again. Thank you 
for joining us.
    You know this, that there are exciting times right now in 
Nevada with the emerging technology, and because of it, the 
exciting economic boon it has been to my state. I do want to 
talk about the battery grant program because I did work with 
Chairman Manchin to include the creation of that battery grant 
program at DOE for both manufacturing and recycling. And 
obviously, we have to bolster the growth of our supply chains 
in North America. So I do want to associate myself with some of 
the concerns mentioned today about making sure that DOE is 
vigilant about not funding operations with connections to the 
Chinese Communist Party. That is why we included language that 
related to foreign entity of concern. So I appreciate your 
comments today on it, but can I just clarify what you said 
today, that the money has not been allocated to Microvast. Is 
that correct?
    Mr. Turk. That is right. The term of art is ``selected to 
negotiate an award.'' And so, that negotiation and that due 
diligence is going on right now.
    Senator Cortez Masto. And because of what you are learning 
today and because of what we know, there is still a possibility 
of ensuring that the money does not go to Microvast?
    Mr. Turk. So for Microvast or any other company that is in 
that category, there are 20 total companies as part of that 
$2.8 billion.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Okay, so, just verification that as 
we sit here today, based on your review, still moving forward, 
what you heard today from my colleagues, there is the 
possibility, based on that new information that we are hearing 
today, that Microvast may not get allocated funds from the 
grant program.
    Mr. Turk. So for Microvast and any other company, that is 
the process that we are in right now. And there is a purposeful 
reason we do this ``selected for negotiating an award'' so that 
we can do that due diligence, the additional due diligence. We 
can make sure we are learning from our intelligence colleagues. 
We are verifying all the accuracy of all the information that 
was submitted in that first selection.
    Senator Cortez Masto. We are going to follow up because I 
want to move on here, but I absolutely have similar concerns 
here. So please, please, know that, and we will be watching as 
well.
    I also want to stress what I have underscored with 
Secretary Granholm multiple times. There is a lot more interest 
for federal support in job creation, as you well know, in 
Nevada--good domestic enterprises that can help us ensure we 
are less reliant on foreign competitors for our critical 
batteries and their components. Given that, can you speak to 
the timeline of rolling out the other half of the battery 
manufacturing funding from DOE? Because I have, obviously, in 
my state, there are companies like Borman Specialty Materials, 
Cox Automotive, and others that can re-apply to help drive our 
needed economy in our recovery in Southern Nevada.
    Mr. Turk. Well, I should have said at the outset, thanks 
for your leadership on this work. And Nevada is incredibly 
well-positioned. Many of your states are incredibly well-
positioned to take full advantage to get the jobs out of this. 
We have got the first tranche, that we are in the process we 
just talked about. I was just talking with my colleagues this 
morning. We are trying to get that second tranche out as 
quickly as we possibly can, and at the same time, learn from 
what we got in the first tranche. So the first tranche just had 
lithium battery companies. We would like to make sure that we 
are broadly building out a diversified battery supply chain. 
And so we will make sure that there is additional language and 
focus to make sure that we are having our eyes wide open and 
the aperture wide open.
    We also want to make sure there are battery supply 
companies across the board, across the manufacturing. We do not 
want to have a certain point in the supply chain still be 
beholden. So we are going to try to make sure that is right. 
But we are moving quickly on that. Our team is working to learn 
lessons from the first tranche and trying to do that as quickly 
as we can.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    Mr. Turk. And you know our Secretary, she wants to move 
quickly on these things.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Quickly, but at the same time----
    Mr. Turk. Do it right.
    Senator Cortez Masto [continuing]. Making sure we get it 
right.
    Mr. Turk. Exactly.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Good. Thank you.
    Critical minerals are increasingly essential for our 
country to have that reliable supply of domestic critical 
minerals. Nevada is a key partner in supplying the critical 
minerals and that is why I fought to secure authorization in 
the $400 million for DOE in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
to prioritize grants that focus on strengthening, like you have 
talked about, every stage in our domestic critical mineral 
supply chain. What can we expect from the forthcoming DOE 
Fiscal Year 2024 budget to support this and other critical 
mineral programs?
    Mr. Turk. Critical minerals are absolutely key. It is a key 
part, and I know you know that, Senator. I know others on the 
Committee know that as well. We did an extensive piece of 
analysis, I think it was 12 total reports. Other agencies did a 
number of other reports analyzing where the critical minerals 
are right now, not just the mining piece, and a lot of people 
focus on the mining piece. It's important. But it's the 
processing. It's the separation. It's all those intermediary 
stages that, right now, are dominated by China, just to be very 
clear.
    Senator Cortez Masto. That's right.
    Mr. Turk. And so we have to have a robust strategy that 
takes that on. The bill funding is incredibly helpful here. The 
IRA tax incentives and other funding, incredibly helpful here, 
but we do think there are other things that could be done. Our 
FY24 budget request, which we are negotiating right now with 
the White House, will have significant additional funding and 
programs to make sure we are moving very aggressively in that. 
And it is domestic strategy, but there are also key partners, 
whether it is Canada, countries in Latin America, or others, we 
want diversified supply chains for critical minerals.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Well, and I would hope as you move 
through this process, you come back to us. It's one thing to 
have the funding available. It's another not to have the 
infrastructure at all for that funding. So I am hoping that you 
are talking to us about the full supply chain here and where we 
can continue to make investments.
    Mr. Turk. Absolutely, and we need your continued guidance 
and feedback, absolutely.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for being 
here.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    And now we want to welcome our newest member, Senator Josh 
Hawley, and thank him for gracing us with his appearance here 
and also being part of this great committee. Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would 
also like to welcome Senator Hawley to the Committee. We are 
delighted to have you representing the great State of 
Missouri--excited, look forward to your continued advocacy for 
American energy. Welcome to the Committee.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman. Thanks to the Ranking Member.
    The Chairman. And now for your questions, but if you have 
any comments we are glad to have them too.
    Senator Hawley. Well, no, I just want to say it is great to 
be here. Thank you for having me.
    Mr. Turk, you are familiar with the Manhattan Project, I 
assume?
    Mr. Turk. I am.
    Senator Hawley. Are you familiar with the effects of the 
Manhattan Project's radioactive waste on schoolchildren in 
Missouri?
    Mr. Turk. I am familiar with not only schoolchildren in 
Missouri, but we have projects all across our country. We have 
an environmental management program, about $8 billion a year 
that works on those efforts.
    Senator Hawley. Great. Well, let's talk about Missouri, if 
we could. In the Hazelwood School District in the St. Louis 
area, I would hope that you are aware that radioactive material 
has been found in Coldwater Creek, which runs right near Jana 
Elementary School. Are you familiar with this?
    Mr. Turk. I am. I have had several conversations with our 
team on this.
    Senator Hawley. Good. Well, you will be aware then that 
radioactive material has been found within 600 feet of Jana 
Elementary School. Coldwater Creek has long been a site 
designated with radioactive waste and material. Again, it goes 
through the school district. There are multiple schools in the 
Hazelwood School District. There was private testing done in 
Jana Elementary itself, in the school building itself, paid for 
by private parties that found radioactive material in the 
building. On the basis of this, the Jana Elementary School is 
now closed. The School Board took the very difficult decision 
in having to close that school. Those students have been sent 
home. They are now distance learning, which as we have learned 
through COVID, is really not much learning at all. You have got 
working parents who now have kids at home not able to learn, 
all closed down.
    I have asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to do 
additional testing on Jana Elementary. They have refused. The 
school district has asked them to do additional testing. They 
have refused. The school district has now written to your 
department, asking DOE to authorize testing of Jana Elementary 
and every other school in the Hazelwood School District. Have 
you seen their letter? They sent it to you a week ago.
    Mr. Turk. I have seen their letter. We have talked about 
it.
    Senator Hawley. Good.
    Mr. Turk. And we are eager to work with you and your staff 
on this.
    Senator Hawley. Okay. Does that mean you will be doing the 
testing?
    Mr. Turk. So we have had conversations, including with the 
Army Corps, and I don't particularly understand where the Army 
Corps is coming from.
    Senator Hawley. Neither do I.
    Mr. Turk. And so we are having conversations with them in 
terms of the jurisdictional nature of it. But happy to have 
conversations, happy to do right by citizens in Missouri and 
elsewhere where we deal with the Manhattan Project 
implications.
    Senator Hawley. Well, with all due respect, I am not 
particularly interested in the conversations. I am interested 
in getting a result here. These parents have been waiting for 
years, frankly, years, to get some cleanup done. I don't think 
it's too much to ask that this school district, beginning with 
Jana Elementary, but the entire school district, get proper 
cleanup done and these kids be able to go to school in a place 
that doesn't have radioactive waste within 600 feet of their 
school or maybe in the building itself. So what the school 
district has asked you to do is to authorize testing 
immediately at the Jana Elementary site and every other school 
building in the Hazelwood School District. They are not asking 
the Army Corps for that, we have already tried that. They are 
asking you. They are asking DOE.
    So my question to you is, will you authorize it?
    Mr. Turk. So I am happy to work with you on that, Senator. 
I need to talk to the team and understand the particulars of 
what is involved there. I don't understand right now the 
particular intricacies of jurisdiction from the Army Corps and 
what our involvement is. We need to have the statutory ability 
to get involved in cases along these lines. So I just need to 
talk to the team, but happy to work urgently on this.
    Senator Hawley. What does that mean, you need to have the 
statutory ability? Unlock that for me----
    Mr. Turk. So the way it has been described to me is, the 
Army Corps has been the principal government agency that has 
been involved here, relevant here, as far as these issues go. I 
just don't know what our involvement is from the DOE side of 
things. What is our particular jurisdictional hook? What is our 
ability to help in this particular situation? So that is what I 
need to go back to our team on and get an answer for you.
    Senator Hawley. Well, let me tell you how this sounds to 
the parents. How this sounds to the parents is, they have, for 
years, been asking to have the site cleaned up. Then they are 
told that there is radioactive waste in a creek that their kids 
play along, right adjacent to their elementary school 
playground. Then they are told that another analysis has found 
radioactive waste in the building. Then they are told that 
their school will be closed and their kids were sent home.
    So now the parents are wondering, have the kids been 
exposed to radioactive material? The kids are now at home, not 
able to learn. And what they hear from the Federal Government 
is, and I have gotten the same runaround--``oh we're not sure, 
oh we don't know.'' The Army Corps says ``well, I am not sure 
we have authority to do any testing.'' You say you don't know 
what your statutory authorizations are. Can we get some people 
in a room together and figure this out so that we can get this 
school tested and get it reopened? And if you are sensing a 
certain impatience in my voice, it is because I am very 
impatient about this.
    Mr. Turk. Well, I am a parent too, and can certainly 
appreciate and understand----
    Senator Hawley. Well, let's do something about it.
    Mr. Turk. Happy to get in a room. Happy to do it with the 
Army Corps. We got the letter just a few weeks ago. We have 
already had several conversations about what we can do to help 
from the DOE side.
    Senator Hawley. Well, if you got it weeks ago, I mean, why 
is it that you don't have anything for me today?
    Mr. Turk. I need to go back to our team and see where they 
are at.
    Senator Hawley. Okay.
    Mr. Turk. The last communication I had was about a week and 
a half ago on it.
    Senator Hawley. Oh, for heaven's sake. Well, listen, while 
we are sitting here talking----
    The Chairman. Senator, if I could help you, maybe, on that, 
because I just got information from staff. Sam has been here 
longer and seen most of this legislation and I was told that 
back maybe 20 years or more ago, Congress transferred that 
authority to the Corps.
    Mr. Turk. That's what I was alluding to.
    The Chairman. He is trying to find out. We have to do that 
here. And I agree with you, it should be done. It should be in 
their hands. He doesn't have the authority right now. I am 
understanding that it is still within the Corps' jurisdiction. 
That's why it's so confusing. That should have never have 
happened.
    Senator Hawley. That may be true, Senator, and I appreciate 
that. It's not so clear to me, actually. It looks like to me 
there is maybe overlapping authority, but what I am trying to 
do here is to light a fire.
    The Chairman. No, I think----
    Senator Hawley. And I just want, just on behalf of the 
parents.
    The Chairman. Sure.
    Senator Hawley. I just want them to, you know, they have 
gotten the runaround for, literally, years. I just wanted to 
let the record reflect that as we are sitting here chatting 
about this, their kids are at home not getting educated. So 
what I am asking you to do is figure it out and get me an 
answer. And if we need to do something legislatively, we are 
going to do it.
    The Chairman. We have to do it. He cannot do that, what you 
just asked him. We can and we must and we should do it as 
quickly as possible. If you put your staff in touch with Sam 
Fowler, we will have it ready for you immediately.
    Senator Hawley. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, but I still 
want an answer from you. I would like the school district, the 
school district has a letter in to you. I would like you to 
answer that. I want to be copied on it and I would like to see 
a response.
    Mr. Turk. We are more than happy to make this a top 
priority, work with Sam, work with the Chairman, work with your 
staff, Senator, and try to do whatever we can from our end to 
be helpful. If there is legislation that is needed, great. This 
is what we do. This is what our environmental management 
program does.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    And now we have Senator Kelly.
    Senator Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Turk, thank you for being here again. I want to talk a 
little bit about the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. It contains 
a provision that I authored, which directs the department to 
promote the installation of demand-response technology in 
federal buildings. And as you know, demand-response technology 
includes smart thermostats and appliances that could save 
consumers money and also stabilize the electrical grid during 
those times when we have peak energy demand and demand is too 
high.
    DOE promotes demand-response in federal and commercial 
buildings already, but the Infrastructure Law explicitly added 
demand-response to the mission and authorizes grants to states 
to implement this. And we have seen this work in Arizona. In 
2020, in the summer, there was a regional heat wave that 
spanned 12 western states and it forced the State of California 
to implement some rolling blackouts, or brownouts.
    Arizona, though, was able to keep its lights on and the air 
conditioning running because our utility providers deployed 
networked smart thermostats in tens of thousands of homes and 
buildings. And these smart devices, they were remotely adjusted 
by utilities to conserve power. So they turned down or they 
turned off, essentially, the air conditioning, in tens of 
thousands of homes, just temporarily. If this happened in your 
house and you wanted to turn it back on, you could just walk 
over to the thermostat and turn it back on immediately. But 
that saved Arizona from a significant problem that summer. In 
exchange--and this is a good deal--in exchange for voluntary 
participation, customers got a rebate or a discount, and some 
Arizona utilities were able to sell excess electricity to 
California and post the revenues as savings to customers' 
monthly bills. And this was done--remember this--this was done 
during a heat wave.
    So Mr. Turk, could you provide an update on the 
implementation of the demand-response provisions in the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and to the extent you can today, 
here, but also, could you provide us with a more detailed 
written report of where we are?
    Mr. Turk. Yes, thank you, Senator, and thanks for your 
focus on demand-response. This is a big, big deal, and done 
right, could be, just as you said, a winner for everybody 
involved--saving money, making sure that we are using the 
assets that we have, especially in peak load and challenging 
weather situations. We have focused on this for many years. The 
additional tools that you and other colleagues have provided in 
the bill are going to be incredibly helpful on this, including 
working through FEMP, but otherwise as well. We have something 
called the Smart Buildings Accelerator that is trying to get 
this out there even more broadly. Our Building Technology 
Office is a real leader in this area, working with states, 
local communities, and utilities across the country.
    So this is a big deal and will leverage those build 
resources as much as we can, but we are building demand-
response into a lot of our other tools in the tool belt, 
looking at ways we can use our loan program to help aggregators 
and others make sure we get the most out of these tools. But 
this is a big deal now, and it is going to be a big deal even 
more in the future. And thank you for your leadership and 
Arizona's leadership on this.
    Senator Kelly. Yes, if you could get us, you know, 
something in writing----
    Mr. Turk. Happy to do it.
    Senator Kelly [continuing]. About where we are, how many 
buildings to date, if there have been any that it has been 
implemented in, and you know, what are the future plans.
    Mr. Turk. Happy to do that, Senator.
    Senator Kelly. Thank you.
    Another subject: as you know, the West has been 
experiencing its driest period in 1,200 years, and we are in a 
drought that has been going on for over two decades. And 
according to DOE estimates, the drought has reduced hydropower 
generation at our federal dams on the Colorado River by 30 
percent already. And DOE's Western Area Power Administration, 
WAPA, and the Bureau of Reclamation deliver that hydropower to 
certain public entities, like irrigation and rural electrical 
districts, tribes, and local governments. In exchange, these 
public entities pay rates and maintenance fees for the dam and 
the transmission infrastructure that goes with it. 
Unfortunately, their power contracts require that these public 
entities pay the operation and maintenance fees even when the 
dams can't generate electricity. And for a lot of us in the 
West, it doesn't make a lot of sense.
    You know, additionally, these customers, at the same time, 
have to buy more expensive electricity on the open market when 
the dams cannot generate the electricity that they were 
intended to produce. So Mr. Turk, could you direct the 
Department and WAPA to provide my office with an estimate of 
the amount of funding needed to cover the operations and 
maintenance obligations of the public entities that receive 
hydroelectric power from federal dams on the Colorado River?
    Mr. Turk. Yes, absolutely, Senator, and the drought is a 
big, big deal, including on the energy infrastructure--
hydropower, in particular. So we are spending a lot of time, 
including working with the Department of the Interior and 
others on this.
    The estimate I have right on hand, and we will get you the 
full details, is about $125 million, but we will follow up with 
a lot more detail on that. Happy to work with you and WAPA and 
others on that.
    Senator Kelly. All right, thank you. I appreciate it.
     I yield back.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Hirono.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Turk, thank you very much for visiting Hawaii last 
month to take part in the Hawaii Clean Energy Forum hosted by 
the University of Hawaii. I am glad that you were able to meet 
people directly and see for yourself part of what Hawaii is 
doing to achieve its goals of 100 percent renewable power by 
2045 and to build an economy with net-zero carbon pollution 
emissions by the same date. And Hawaii is creating a blueprint 
that others can follow. I am going to give you a broad 
question. What did you learn in your trip to Hawaii, aside from 
that it is a beautiful place, about Hawaii's leadership on 
clean energy?
    Mr. Turk. Well, it was a pleasure to come and visit your 
beautiful state. I was there for about 36 hours and then got 
back on a red-eye plane coming back to DC.
    Senator Hirono. Yes.
    Mr. Turk. I have to say, I came away incredibly impressed. 
Your new Governor, Governor Green, who I had a chance to spend 
several hours with, and his new team coming in, was incredibly 
impressive. Everyone who is involved in energy, especially in 
clean energy, and Hawaii has been a leader for many, many 
years, including having some of the most ambitious goals, 
earliest, of any state out there. It seemed like there was a 
wind at the back and everybody was working well together. So 
the conversation we had and we are following up on is, all 
these tools now in our tool belt--expanded tool belt--how can 
we bring those to help, whether it's on PV, whether it's on 
grid, whether it's on wind, onshore and potential for offshore, 
geothermal potential in Hawaii. I visited an agri-voltaic site, 
which I think is incredibly exciting, to do the PV, but also at 
the same time, grow crops, incredibly, for potential use in 
Hawaii, but elsewhere as well.
    So I came away incredibly impressed, and especially in the 
Governor's new term, it feels like this is a real window to 
double down, working with you, working with your staff and 
again, trying to leverage all these tools that you all have 
given us through the Bipartisan Infrastructure legislation and 
the IRA as well.
    Senator Hirono. We put in a lot of money to enable states 
like Hawaii to get on with moving away from dependence on 
fossil fuel, which Hawaii has made incredible progress on, 
because we were the most fossil fuel dependent state in the 
entire country, and we paid more for our electricity than any 
other state, and all of the things that we are doing are for 
the purpose of not only environmental issues, but to enable us 
to pay far less. Part of what we need to do is grid 
modernization. And as we move forward with enabling more homes 
to get the storage units into their homes and get a rebate, or 
an incentive to that, so grid modernization will enable the 
homeowners to not only pay zero for their home energy, but also 
to be able to put energy into the system. So the grid has to be 
able to handle all that. It is pretty complicated. So, is part 
of the kind of tools and resources that we have made available 
through the various bills that we enacted going to help Hawaii 
be able to modernize its grid so that all this can be happening 
in as rapidly a fashion as possible so we can meet our 2045 
goals?
    Mr. Turk. So the short answer is yes, but we have to work 
deliberately and with an urgency and sense of purpose and look 
at the tools on the tool belt. We have this new Office, the 
State and Community Energy Program Office. The head of that 
office was actually with me in Hawaii to make sure that we had 
that follow-up so that we can work hand-in-hand following the 
lead of what Hawaii wants to do, but use these tools to support 
that. One effort that I referenced to the Governor, which I 
think is a pretty impressive tool, is something our National 
Renewable Energy Lab, NREL, has developed. They worked with Los 
Angeles on LA100. The Secretary actually is, right now, down in 
Puerto Rico for Puerto Rico 100 (PR100). The idea is to use the 
technical expertise that we have in the U.S. Government, 
working hand-in-hand, not only with elected officials, but 
local groups and utilities and others, and develop a plan going 
forward.
    How do we actually build out that grid? The grid is so 
important, just as you mentioned, along those lines. So we 
would be eager to have further conversation to see if that kind 
of broader analysis, that kind of stakeholder engagement--
obviously, it will be Hawaii-driven and Hawaii-led, but we are 
eager for the Department of Energy to support that in any way 
we can.
    Senator Hirono. So speaking of things like technical 
assistance et cetera, could you provide an update on what DOE 
is doing to implement the 21st Century Advisory Workforce 
Board, because presumably all of this effort to get us to a 
renewable situation is going to create different kinds of jobs. 
So this was an amendment that I offered to the IIJA, with 
Senator Cantwell, to establish a board of experts to promote or 
provide recommendations to the Secretary of Energy supporting 
current and future energy sector workforce needs. So can you 
update me on what is happening with the creation of this 
workforce board?
    Mr. Turk. Well, first, thanks for your leadership with 
Senator Cantwell on this incredibly important provision. The 
charter for this is coming out in two weeks and then we will 
have nominations in May. So we are trying to move very quickly 
on this.
    Senator Hirono. Good. Thank you very much.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator King.
    Senator King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Turk, thank you very much for being with us today.
    I think the three essential priorities to getting us to a 
clean energy future are: number one, storage; number two, 
storage; and number three, storage. You are astride a whole 
series of provisions of the infrastructure bill involving 
research and development for storage technologies. I guess the 
first thing is to get from you, I hope, a sense of urgency 
about this.
    Mr. Turk. So there is an absolute sense of urgency on this, 
and not just for the near-term storage, the battery technology, 
but the long-duration energy storage as well. It was one of our 
very first--I think it was in our second Energy Earthshot that 
we put out a very aggressive goal to drive down those costs of 
long-duration energy storage because we will need to have that 
in our tool kit as well.
    Senator King. Well, long-duration, and one of the concerns 
I have is there is a bipartisan letter that went out just in 
the last week----
    Mr. Turk. I saw it.
    Senator King [continuing]. On how we can't just put all of 
our eggs in the lithium-ion basket, and I hope that there is a 
diversity of research on other technologies. We had testimony 
here, fascinating testimony, about iron-oxygen, which I think 
is happening in West Virginia and other--you know, molten salt 
and old-fashioned pumped storage. So I am very much hopeful 
that the Department will have a wide aperture in terms of the 
technologies that you are looking at.
    Mr. Turk. So absolutely. There is a wide variety of really 
impressive technologies, a lot of them that have been developed 
in our labs or in partnership with private companies out there. 
As you referenced in the letter, and thank you very much for 
the letter, the first $2.8 billion that went out on battery 
manufacturing did just have lithium. It was open to other types 
of technology, but those were the ones that our team--and these 
are civil servants making these judgments--felt were most 
mature for this first tranche. What we have said is, let's go 
back with the second tranche, which we are trying to get out as 
quickly as we can, and make sure that aperture is open wide. 
But that is just one tool in the tool belt. We have ARPA-E. We 
have any number of other funding streams that are working on a 
wide variety of other energy storage technologies. And because 
it is so important, we need to have a diversified array of 
potentials.
    Senator King. And one of the potentials that you did not 
mention that I think is important is recycling, in two ways--
recycling batteries themselves, but also using after-life 
automobile batteries in accumulation to provide longer-term 
grid storage.
    Mr. Turk. I completely agree. And one of the best parts of 
this job is going out to our labs and visiting with 
entrepreneurs who are working on some of these technologies. 
And some of the technologies have the greater potential for 
recycling. And we certainly want to take advantage of all of 
these. We are building out our battery manufacturing here in 
the U.S., $92 billion of public and private investments----
    Senator King. Amazing investment in the last----
    Mr. Turk. It is just amazing. That is going to be an awful 
lot of batteries out there, and we need to make sure we have a 
plan in place to recycle, to make the most out of that 
resource.
    Senator King. Well, that leads me to my next question, 
which is the establishment of standards. There is a provision 
in the law, I think it is Section 40111, that talks about 
establishing standards and safety measures because--you say an 
awful lot of batteries--we have got to be sure they are safe 
and effective. And I hope that is also a focus of your work.
    Mr. Turk. Absolutely, a real priority. Thanks for flagging 
that one in particular.
    Senator King. Well, I think that is very important. Now, 
this leads us to permitting reform, Mr. Chairman. Permitting 
reform is--we are in a race against time here and we can't--we 
have had testimony before this Committee that it takes over ten 
years to permit a pumped storage project, which is a 100-year-
old technology. It is very well-established and well-known. We 
cannot afford that. And the same thing goes with whether it's 
acquiring lithium. I did some research recently. It turns out 
that about 70 percent of the lithium that we use comes from 
Australia. That's good. The problem is, 87 percent of the 
processed lithium comes from China. And we have got to develop 
that kind of technology as well, and that is going to involve 
being able to do it on a timely and predictable basis because, 
again, the goal here is clean energy, but we cannot allow the 
permitting process itself, not standards, but the process 
itself, to become a barrier to having us achieve that clean 
energy future. It would be ironic if environmental objections 
to copper, for example, which we need to expand the grid, ended 
up compromising or crippling our ability to expand the grid in 
order to accommodate a cleaner energy future. Do you follow me?
    Mr. Turk. I completely agree, and we have to do a better 
job, and we have to do a better job across the board on 
permitting. And it's not just the mining piece, it's the 
processing piece, it's the separation and diversifying those 
supply chains, working with Australia and other partners, but a 
lot of those jobs can be here in the U.S. as well. One area in 
particular that we are very focused on is transmission 
permitting.
    Senator King. Well, I was just--that was my next question. 
And one of the issues about transmission is, there is this odd 
incentive structure in the utility business where you get your 
rate of return based on how much you spend to build the 
project. What we have got to talk about in transmission is 
improvements to the existing grid that may be way less 
expensive than building all new towers and wires, but would 
give us increased capacity. And perhaps this should be a 
discussion with FERC, but I think we really need to talk about 
how to develop the technology to increase the grid's capacity 
without starting all over.
    Mr. Turk. I think it makes perfect sense, and one of our 
new offices we created with the bill funding is the Grid 
Deployment Office. Phenomenal leadership in that office, 
phenomenal team, working on exactly those kinds of things and 
being smart about it.
    Senator King. And I think we do need to talk to FERC and 
NARUC about the disincentive to cost-effectively upgrade the 
grid as opposed to building a whole new transmission.
    Mr. Turk. We don't have the time to just let things 
organically happen. We have got to accelerate. We need to 
connect those dots.
    Senator King. And the permitting is a lot easier if you are 
putting gizmos on existing towers rather than cutting a new 
path through the people's backyards.
    Mr. Turk. Absolutely.
    Senator King. Final, just quick point. How are you doing on 
staffing? What you are stepping into now is a huge undertaking 
in terms of grants and monitoring, frankly, and the accounting 
and all of that, the contract work. I have heard recently you 
were about a thousand people down. You have done some hiring 
back. Where does that stand?
    Mr. Turk. Yes, so I have been very pleased with the 
applicant pool, even though it is a tight labor market, when we 
established our clean energy corps, which was a way to build up 
our staffing to staff all these new provisions. We ended up 
getting tens of thousands of applications, incredible talent, 
not just----
    Senator King. People that are interested in the mission.
    Mr. Turk. I think they are interested in the mission. They 
are interested in doing what we can in the U.S. to save our 
planet, and at the same time, an awful lot of jobs and 
communities benefiting from it.
    So we are now at an additional 400, just over 400 new staff 
that have come on for the bill and IRA provisions as well. We 
have got about another 100 in the pipeline that will be coming 
on shortly, and we will need to staff-up further from there. 
But we are trying to do it in a very disciplined way and in a 
very deliberate way, but still urgently as well. And some 
phenomenal talent--I have to say, it is one of my favorite 
things to meet with some of the new staff coming on, the 
mission drive, the excitement to be part of the Department of 
Energy at this golden era is really inspiring.
    Senator King. Great. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    The Chairman. Senator Hickenlooper.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great, thank you for your testimony 
and your time and your service.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    The IIJA--I-JA, as we call it--revived an important federal 
authority to identify areas that need transmission, and it 
provided a federal path for siting and permitting when states 
fail to do so, and some of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission started their process for implementation of the 
backstop siting authority. Can you update us on that timeline 
for DOE's identifying and designating corridors of interest?
    Mr. Turk. Yes, so we are working very quickly on that. We 
have got this Grid Deployment Office focused on it. And I am 
told the report, the Needs Study, will be out very soon. So I 
don't know, Jeremiah, if you have a further update on that, but 
hopefully that is days and weeks. Days--oh wow.
    Senator Hickenlooper. That's a good answer.
    Mr. Turk. And that leads to the corridors, right? That is 
the process.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes, no, I got that. Good answer. 
Thank you.
    The Bipartisan Infrastructure bill's Regional Clean 
Hydrogen Hubs program is a, I think, generational opportunity 
for commercializing clean hydrogen across sectors. We have to 
acknowledge that not all end-users are created equal. What we 
are showing here is what Michael Liebreich, founder of 
Bloomberg New Energy Finance, calls his Hydrogen Ladder.
    [Poster of Liebreich's Hydrogen Ladder follows:]

    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T1458.276
    
    Senator Hickenlooper. It is simply one expert's prediction 
as to where hydrogen will find the most promising uses, taking 
into account both the attributes of hydrogen, but also the 
competition it is up against from other clean resources. 
Specific predictions aside, what is DOE doing to critically 
assess the long-term promise of different end-uses with 
evaluating applications for hydrogen hubs, and are you thinking 
about supply or demand side support measures as well?
    Mr. Turk. So we are absolutely thinking about both the 
supply and the demand and the pipeline, another way to get the 
hydrogen around. Michael Liebreich is a friend of mine. I have 
worked with him for years, and I find his ladder incredibly 
interesting and helpful. We are doing our analysis. We put out 
our report--our strategy, our hydrogen roadmap that is trying 
to think very comprehensively about this, what tools we have in 
our tool belt. We have got a lot more tools now, thanks to your 
leadership and others on the hydrogen front to really move out 
on that. And we have the tax credit, which I think is going to 
be a real game-changer on hydrogen as well. It is a very potent 
tax incentive along those lines.
    The other thing we have done internally so that we can be 
coherent and strategic is, we have created a hydrogen joint 
strategy team. So there are a lot of offices in DOE that have 
some hydrogen tools in their tool belt, and we want to make 
sure it is part of a comprehensive strategy. So this joint 
strategy team, it is made up of dozens of people across many, 
many offices, is working, I think, quite well, to make sure we 
have a coherence in the strategy, just as you are suggesting.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great.
    And last question--even if we stopped emitting all 
CO<INF>2</INF> today, we would still benefit considerably from 
removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In our most recent 
FY23 appropriations bill, Congress included language 
establishing a pilot program expanding the kinds of carbon 
dioxide removal technologies that could receive federal support 
through the direct procurement of atmospheric CO<INF>2</INF>. 
How does the Department plan on implementing this provision as 
a complement to provisions in the IIJA?
    Mr. Turk. Well, thanks for your leadership on that. I 
completely agree, we are going to need cost-effective carbon 
dioxide removal technologies, and there is a variety of 
different technologies that are potentially relevant here. And 
we are going to move out aggressively on that. We do have 
funding from the bill, the Direct Air Capture Hubs, which we 
are moving out quite quickly on, and I appreciate your thought 
leadership and your guidance to make sure we are eyes-wide-open 
with a wide aperture in terms of the technology space here and 
trying to be smart about that funding.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right. Sometimes when you start off 
on that slower rate you can actually have your eyes dilated and 
you get more--I guess you see more color saturation is what 
someone would say.
    Mr. Turk. Well, in one of our Earthshots, it is exactly to 
try to accelerate--compress timelines and use all tools, 
including ARPA-E and other parts of our DOE offices to be 
helpful in this space.
    Senator Hickenlooper. You are either going to have a great 
time or you are going to have a really hard time.
    Mr. Turk. We have got to work it, we have got to work it.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Got to make it work. You have no 
choice. Thank you.
    Mr. Turk. Absolutely.
    Senator Hickenlooper. I yield back to the Chair.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Really quickly on that--when do you expect to make some of 
your announcements on the hydrogen hubs?
    Mr. Turk. So the hydrogen hub timeline is--we have done the 
33 encouraged, 46 not--April 7 is when the full applications 
are in, and they are going to make selections no later than Q4. 
But as you know from our Secretary, she is going to try to move 
that timeline up, but do it right.
    The Chairman. Got you.
    Real quick, I just have a couple questions, if I may?
    The infrastructure bill provided $300 million for DOE's 
Carbon Utilization Program, which includes projects to 
commercialize innovative uses of coal. The CHIPS Act also 
authorized coal innovation projects at DOE. We know that coal 
has so many values to it, not just for burning, creating fire, 
and heating and making steam to produce energy. Projects have 
shown that coal and waste coal can be used to process graphite 
for batteries, metal composites, building materials, rare earth 
elements, and other essential products that are going to be 
needed for the construction, defense, and energy industries in 
more sustainable ways than the traditional methods being used 
today. However, the DOE recently terminated some promising 
projects to commercialize new uses for coal. It seems like they 
have a hard time accepting that coal has more values, since 
they want to eliminate it. DOE has said that there is a lack of 
funding for these projects, despite the hundreds of millions of 
dollars that Congress has made available.
    So my question would be, will you all continue to support 
commercialization of innovations, uses for coal, including from 
newly mined coal or from coal waste? We have a commercial 
project now where rare earth minerals are being extracted from 
coal waste. It has already been mined. You don't have to do 
anything. Just clean it up. And are you all going to ensure 
that funding from the infrastructure bill and the CHIPS Act 
will be used to support this work?
    Mr. Turk. Well, and you know, Senator, we have been working 
as a Department on this, including our NETL colleagues that you 
know very well.
    The Chairman. Very well.
    Mr. Turk. Brian Anderson and the team there.
    The Chairman. Yes.
    Mr. Turk. We have got a whole team, the Minerals 
Sustainability Division in our Fossil Energy and Carbon 
Management Office, focused on this. What I am told is, we have 
got four smaller pilot projects out there.
    The Chairman. Right.
    Mr. Turk. And there are plans to try to build from that. So 
I'm happy to talk further with you and your staff to make sure 
we are going forward in a way that makes sense.
    The Chairman. I just think what we have to do is, you know, 
I have already talked about using the all-of-the-above energy 
that we have and all the resources we have. We have been, for 
far too long, asking other parts of the world to do what we 
consider the dirty work that we would not do for ourselves. And 
we do it better and cleaner and more environmentally correct 
than anyplace else in the world. So I will be talking to 
Secretary Granholm more about this, and to the White House.
    The other one I have is that the White House recently 
issued guidelines about how greenhouse gas emissions are 
considered for NEPA reviews. One of my concerns with this 
guidance is that it clearly favors renewables over fossil 
projects. Let me be very clear--this Administration has 
misaligned the purpose of the IRA. The IRA is for energy 
security, and it has been touted by the Administration as 
strictly an environmental bill. I don't know if people know, 
you cannot put a windmill up unless you are extracting. You 
cannot put a solar farm on BLM lands unless you are extracting. 
We have to have fossil fuels in our mix and be fossil fuel 
independent rather than asking Iran to produce more oil to 
bring the market prices down, knowing it has a global effect, 
and we are saying, oh, let's ask Iran, the most prolific 
terrorist supporter in the world, to give them more resources 
to do more destruction to humankind. It makes no sense, but on 
that, we seem to be fighting this continuously. And all we are 
doing is saying we do it better than anyplace in the world. And 
if we do it--replace our dirty fossil from around the world 
with our clean fossil from the U.S.--that is a tremendous, 
tremendous support of the environment. I like to think we take 
a balanced approach.
    The guidance says agencies should accelerate permitting for 
projects that have no emissions, or that reduce emissions, and 
the guidance provides only solar and wind projects as an 
example. It does not even talk about, you know, the fossil fuel 
emissions that can be reduced with carbon capture. So I guess, 
how do you look at NEPA reviews for grants and loans, and are 
you going to give carbon capture the same priority as you do 
for renewables?
    Mr. Turk. Well, thanks for the question, Chairman, and I 
should say a big thanks, certainly on behalf of the Department, 
and frankly, the American people, for all your leadership, not 
only on the bill but the IRA and the energy security benefits--
--
    The Chairman. Do you know how frustrating it is to 
basically have a piece of legislation that every Democrat voted 
for and see the Administration trying to change the 
implementation of it? Do you know how frustrating it is to go 
and fight the way we did and have to then go back and fight our 
own Administration to do the right thing?
    Mr. Turk. Well, just to put it on the record for myself and 
our Department, the energy security benefits, the affordability 
benefits, we are seeing benefits already from the IRA and the 
bill, all across the country.
    The Chairman. Well, how about the world? And if you could 
talk about this, David, about the interest that the rest of the 
world has in the United States. We came from last place--as far 
as our investments, being convinced that we could do things 
more innovative and creatively--to first. And now, because I 
heard from all of Europe--trust me, I am hearing from Europe.
    Mr. Turk. I know you are hearing it. I am hearing it. I 
think, frankly, there is a jealousy, and that is a good 
motivator for others to get their acts together as well. And we 
are seeing that in Europe with President von der Leyen and 
others. We need to race to the top. And you, through your 
leadership, have put us in the lead.
    The Chairman. Well, all of us here.
    Mr. Turk. All, thank you.
    The Chairman. And the bottom line is, is that we met with 
the representatives from the European Union yesterday in my 
office, letting them know that we want to do things. The thing 
I was discouraged by was that we could not, being the 
superpower of the world, help our European friends and our 
neighbors and our allies quickly enough when Putin weaponized 
energy, trying to destroy their economy and harm their 
citizens. That is why we said, let's do a piece of legislation 
that uses the resources that we have in the cleanest fashion to 
be energy independent, using the fossil power we have, 
investing $369 billion to create the new technology--less 
carbon, if you will, but also not replacing what we need now 
until we have the other of them do the job. That is all we try 
to do. And I don't know why we are in denial.
    Mr. Turk. Well, my hope is we are going to have such cost 
reductions because of all that you have done, other Committee 
members have done----
    The Chairman. We are accelerating.
    Mr. Turk. That is going to help us not only in the U.S.----
    The Chairman. That is----
    Mr. Turk. But it is going to help the rest of the world, 
including the developing countries of the world who need these 
technologies so that they can have energy, they can have the 
benefits----
    The Chairman. I want to put this on the record too. When I 
was meeting with all the Europeans, I said, listen, I did not 
fault you all when you all went down and you wanted cap and 
trade and you went carbon pricing. It did not accelerate the 
innovative and creative spirits it would take to fix it. Once 
the pricing got into the market, do you follow me?
    Mr. Turk. Yes.
    The Chairman. It was accepted, this is what you are going 
to pay. This is the cost of the product. And it was all 
accepted. We took the, you know, the carrot and the stick. They 
used the stick for years and we were not able to mature and 
accelerate quickly enough. We did not pick energy technologies 
that were conceptual. We picked energy technologies that we 
knew were already, you know, proven. We just never matured 
them. Now we are going to mature hydrogen, small modular 
reactors, and battery storage, all of the things that need to 
be done to go the direction we want.
    And I told the Europeans, we are sharing that with you all. 
We will share it with you. If you can come to, you know, to 
innovative and creative opportunities quicker than we, you will 
share it with us. We did this because we were not able to, I 
think, to be able to perform our responsibilities as a 
superpower of the world, to help all the freedom-loving 
democracies that we have to support, and we have taken an oath 
to. That was the reason, what we have done. Please quit 
fighting, just tell them. Work with us.
    Mr. Turk. This is a race to the top and this is how we get 
it done. And I think the dynamic and your leadership--our 
leadership in the U.S.--is playing an incredibly helpful role, 
and I know history will record this very favorably. People may 
not appreciate that.
    On Ukraine, I have to say, just to tell the Committee we 
have a second tranche going over on military transport right 
now of electrical equipment going to Ukraine. We have a third 
tranche coming about a month from now, but that is just a 
direct part of what we are trying to do to help our incredibly 
brave Ukrainian friends and colleagues.
    The Chairman. Senator King, I think you had a follow-up?
    Thank you.
    Senator King. First, I just love the image of you giving 
them hell in Davos.
    The Chairman. It was front and center. It was a frontal 
attack, I will tell you one thing, but I had to convince them 
that we are still allies and we are on the same side here. We 
are trying to help each other and we think we can do it 
quicker.
    Senator King. I have this picture in my mind on that.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator King. I would've loved to have been a fly on the 
wall.
    The Chairman. You would have enjoyed it.
    Senator King. I'm sure I would have.
    The Chairman. Chancellor Scholz, myself, and Macron and the 
whole group, it was something.
    Senator King. I dare say they've never seen nothin' like 
you.
    [Laughter.]
    The Chairman. I won't comment on that.
    Senator King. Okay.
    Mr. Turk, we have been talking about large projects--energy 
storage, batteries, all those kinds of things. I hope that 
there is attention being paid also to smaller, sort of, 
individual things. I have an app on my phone that controls my 
furnace at home and I can turn the temperature down to 65 or 66 
during the day when I am not there and an hour before I go 
home, I turn it up to 72 or 70. And I got a message from the 
company that makes the thermostat--it saved me 29 percent on my 
energy bill last year. And all over America, we are heating 
space where nobody is, we are cooking water that nobody needs 
at that particular moment, and I think there is a huge 
opportunity for using personal technology.
    The other factor is providing people with information about 
their energy use. A simple dashboard that people can look at to 
see what they are using in their home heating and their 
electricity. There is something called the Prius Effect, which 
is they find that people that drive automobiles that tell them 
how much energy they are using tend to use less energy. Forget 
about the technology of the automobile. If you ever hear about 
me running into a tree, it will probably be because I am 
looking at that chart trying to get an extra tenth of a mile 
out of the mileage.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator King. So what I am suggesting is, think small as 
well as big, and think about these technologies. There is 
enormous potential in this device [the Senator holds up a 
cellphone] for energy control and using energy much more 
efficiently. The cheapest and cleanest kilowatt-hour is the one 
that is never used. And I believe there is still room for 
conservation and creative use of energy as opposed to the 
profligate heat the house all day, even though nobody is there.
    Thoughts?
    Mr. Turk. So I could not agree more with you, Senator. Just 
another nugget on there, and I think the potential here is 
huge. And frankly, some of our IT companies are not doing what 
they should be doing. This is a great way to leverage their 
business resources and be a helpful corporate partner as well.
    Google and Google Maps has a new feature, I guess it has 
now been out for maybe a year or so. It has a little leaf when 
you plot what course you want to go in. That leaf is powered by 
NREL and our analysis. So our national labs are putting 
information in there that allows Google Maps to say this route 
is more energy efficient. You may consider doing this, and it 
is only one minute longer than the route that you might have 
been going otherwise. So I think that is an incredibly powerful 
example of exactly what you are talking about,
    Senator King. People will often make--or usually make--the 
right decision if they have the data.
    Mr. Turk. If they have the data and if you make it easy for 
them, this is where, to Senator Hickenlooper's question, smart 
demand-response, and automating it, and people can override it, 
right, if they, if their Nest thermostat is doing something 
that they don't want, override it, but you save an awful lot of 
money if you are smart about it. And we need to have the 
incentives in place for the aggregators, for the IT companies, 
to leverage that. But I could not agree more on that.
    Senator King. Well, I hope you might have a small bureau, a 
small office of cool stuff.
    Mr. Turk. We will call it the ``Cool Stuff Office.''
    Senator King. Yes, of people that are thinking about, you 
know, not the huge, big, multimillion or billion dollar 
projects, but thinking about these kinds of apps and 
technologies that can be used to conserve and save energy, 
which, as I say, the cheapest and cleanest kilowatt-hour is the 
one that is not used.
    Mr. Turk. I was talking with Cass Sunstein, who may be 
someone that some folks know. He was helping the Department of 
Homeland Security. He called it the ``default effect.'' If you 
are able to use technologies and get people using less energy 
as a default, they can still override, but you save an awful 
lot of energy if you do it in a smart, kind of, thoughtful way. 
So I love your idea. I will take it back and we will see what 
we can do to be even more helpful in this space.
    Senator King. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Hickenlooper, do you have any follow-
ups?
    Senator Hickenlooper. No, just, I think this is a great 
conversation to have. As always, well put together and I really 
appreciate you taking the time and the staff to really be well 
prepared to come in and answer these questions quickly and 
pretty much give encouraging, you know, ambitious answers, 
which is, you know, what we need to do.
    The Chairman. Well, let me just say, David, thank you. As 
you can tell, the interest everyone has here and all that, but 
you know, truly if they--the position we are in right now is 
enviable for the whole world. We never thought we would get 
here. It was a very trying and hard time to get here. We have a 
balanced approach, and that is all we are saying is the United 
States of America should not depend on any other nation to 
supply us the energy that we need to defend ourselves and help 
our allies. That's it. What we should do is continue to be a 
leader, and if you want to be a superpower, you had better be 
energy independent and secure, and that's what we are trying to 
do.
    So please tell my dear friend, the Secretary, that we are 
in this together. We are all working together and we will make 
it happen. And I can tell you, you have the support from this 
Committee.
    So with that being said, members will have until close of 
business tomorrow to submit any additional questions that you 
may have for the record.
    The Committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:46 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
