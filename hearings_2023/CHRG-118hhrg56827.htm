                              ----------                              

                       Tuesday, December 12, 2023

               U.S. House of Representatives,
                      Committee on Homeland Security,
                           Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, 
                           Law Enforcement, and Intelligence,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:41 p.m., in 
room 310, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. August Pfluger 
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
    Present: Representatives Pfluger, Bishop, D'Esposito, 
Crane, Magaziner, Correa, and Titus.
    Mr. Pfluger. The Committee on Homeland Security, 
Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Law Enforcement, and 
Intelligence will come to order.
    Without objection, the subcommittee may recess at any 
point.
    The purpose of this hearing today is to evaluate the 
unprecedented uptick in organized retail crime in the United 
States and to hear testimony from key witnesses from Federal 
Government and private industry.
    I now recognize myself for an opening statement.
    Good afternoon. We welcome you to today's important hearing 
on organized retail crime and threats to our public safety. The 
topic of today's hearing is the issue of organized retail crime 
which has been rising throughout the country demonstrating a 
threat to tens of thousands of retailers of all size and 
subjecting employees and customers to real harm.
    As many Americans flock to stores to complete their holiday 
shopping this Christmas season, large organizations of 
professional shoplifters or boosters are exploiting soft-on-
crime policies to ransack American businesses and carry out an 
unprecedented spike in retail crime.
    Generally, organized retail crime involves the association 
of two or more persons engaged in illegally obtaining 
merchandise of value from retail establishments through theft 
and/or fraud as part of a criminal enterprise. This is not the 
same thing as shoplifting or petty theft, both of which 
obviously are illegal. This type of organized activity involves 
multiple occurrences and may transpire across various stores 
and State jurisdictions further complicating matters for law 
enforcement agencies to combat these crimes.
    We also have reports that transnational criminal 
organizations or TCOs that are taking advantage of our open 
borders are also engaging in retail theft. It's important to 
note that these criminals do not show any bias when selecting 
targets, and this crime occurs across a wide spectrum, from big 
cities to small towns, in both urban and also rural areas.
    It has been said that organized retail crime is overblown. 
That's false. We cannot remain oblivious to the surge in 
organized retail crime throughout the country impacting every 
one of our districts.
    As many of us have seen, retailers are not overhyping the 
threats or challenges posed by the criminal activity. They are 
taking steps to ensure the safety of their staff, customers, 
and products. This includes measures like placing common items 
like detergent and baby formula behind antitheft plexiglas and 
utilizing smart shopping carts equipped with automatic locking 
wheels to prevent thieves from exiting the stores with the cart 
without paying.
    In Washington, DC, where the progressive city council has 
implemented soft-on-crime legislation that has emboldened 
criminals to run rampant through the District, one CVS has 
resorted to displaying tissue paper and rolls of toilet paper 
as photographs, not the actual product but as photographs, to 
prevent theft. In situations like this, we must look at the 
immediate impact on families and consumers. This right here 
directly drives away a mother looking to buy diapers and 
formula at her neighborhood store or a family looking to 
quickly grab over-the-counter medicine for their loved ones. 
These chaotic, calculated robberies not only pose a risk to 
employees, customers, and store owners, but there's a 
multifaceted domino effect on our communities as well as the 
workload that occurs on law enforcement.
    The National Retail Federation, which will be participating 
in the second panel today, serving over 230 retail asset 
protection professionals and found that 90 percent indicated 
that organized retail crime is more of a risk to retail 
businesses now than it was just 3 years ago.
    Businesses of all size and all locations, from big box 
stores like Home Depot, Macy's, Gap, Walmart, Target, CVS, 
Walgreens, and many others to mom-and-pop shops like 
Eggemeyer's General Store in my hometown in San Angelo, Texas, 
are all worried about these alarming trends and are sounding 
the alarm on the rise of criminal activity tied to them.
    In addition to wide-spread theft, some of these cases have 
turned deadly. Just last week a security guard at a Macy's in 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was fatally stabbed by a man 
attempting to steal merchandise. A second security guard was 
also injured. According to reports, the suspect who was later 
arrested has a history of retail theft, of robbery, and drug 
offenses across the Philadelphia region. Moreover, at this 
Macy's location alone, they filed over 250 reports of retail 
theft in a year.
    Then last year at a Home Depot in Hillsboro, North 
Carolina, an elderly employee of Home Depot, Gary Rasor, was 
assaulted by a man attempting to steal power washers. According 
to reports, Mr. Rasor, who was 82 years old, was violently 
shoved during the attempted theft and later died of his 
injuries. Sadly, these incidents are not isolated, and similar 
tragedies have occurred across the country, notwithstanding the 
violence tied to organized retail crime has resulted in damage 
to storefronts and other property as we've seen on the news in 
many locations.
    Organized retail crime is also responsible for financial 
losses to retailers. As a result, they have begun closing 
stores in certain locations which also creates a negative 
impact on those communities that they serve and kills jobs for 
thousands of Americans. According to a report by the Retail 
Industry Leaders Association on the impact of organized retail 
crime, nearly $70 billion worth of goods was stolen from 
American retailers in 2019.
    On a micro level, Walmart has stated that it loses nearly 
$3 billion per year in U.S. revenue due to theft. The severity 
of large-scale theft and other factors has led Walmart to close 
several stores and has a raising of prices effect Nation-wide. 
Reports also indicated that Walmart plans to open a police work 
space within one of its Atlanta stores, a recent drastic 
measure aimed at mitigating criminal activities.
    Target recently announced it would be closing 9 stores 
across 4 cities--New York, Seattle, San Francisco, and 
Portland--due to concerns about employee and customer safety 
from violence tied to organized retail crime.
    Part of the challenge in addressing organized retail crime 
includes the high felony theft threshold and bail reform laws 
that have emboldened criminals to participate in organized 
retail crime. Criminals often pilfer items below the threshold 
for felony charges recognizing that such offenses are typically 
not subject to prosecution in certain jurisdictions. Criminals 
also know that they will be released under certain weak bail 
reform laws. Upon release these criminals proceed to engage in 
similar or more severe criminal activities without encountering 
any consequences.
    I look forward to hearing from San Diego County District 
Attorney Summer Stephan, who will also be the next president of 
the National District Attorneys Association, on the important 
role that prosecutors play in the safety of our communities, 
including addressing the challenge of organized retail crime.
    I also look forward to this hearing as an opportunity for 
bipartisanship, for us to come together and hopefully agree 
that we do have a real issue here and, if so, what can we be 
doing at this level. This surge in retail theft is more than 
just teenagers looking for a thrill, but it's an abuse of soft-
on-crime policies and evidence of a deeper-rooted issue driving 
crime and fear amongst our communities.
    We have a distinguished panel of witnesses testifying 
today, including a Federal panel of witnesses, to examine 
efforts to combat the rising trend of organized retail crime. 
We will also hear from a second panel of witnesses from 
industry and State government about their perspective on this 
serious challenge.
    I would like to thank all of the witnesses with us this 
afternoon, and I look forward to the discussion.

    Thank you to all our witnesses for being with us this afternoon, 
and I look forward to our discussion.

    Mr. Pfluger. I now recognize the Ranking Member, my friend, 
the gentleman from Rhode Island, Mr. Magaziner, for his opening 
statement.
    Mr. Magaziner. Thank you, Chairman Pfluger, for working 
with us to call this hearing on the issue of organized retail 
crime.
    Many of us have heard from retailers concerned by organized 
retail crime, and so today's hearing is for us to explore the 
scope of the problem and determine best how to respond.
    Crime overall continues to be at historically low levels 
and has fallen even more in recent years. According to the FBI, 
between 1993 and 2022, the violent crime rate across the United 
States has fallen by more than half, with homicides falling 35 
percent, robberies falling 76 percent, and burglaries falling 
78 percent, and the trend continues to this day. The FBI 
reports that violent crime decreased a further 2 percent in 
2022 compared to the previous year.
    However, we must always strive to do better to ensure that 
all Americans are safe in their homes, their schools, and their 
neighborhoods. We have heard reports of organized retail crime 
becoming more prevalent, which leads us to today's hearing.
    We all need to understand the nature of organized retail 
crime and the best practices for ending it. I want to be clear 
what we are talking about here. We are not talking about 
ordinary shoplifting committed by individuals working alone. We 
are talking about large organized groups who engage in 
systematic theft of retail goods and the subsequent resale of 
stolen goods for financial gain.
    Organized retail crime does not just impact large 
retailers. It also affects mom-and-pop shops and especially 
retail employees. Beyond the important concerns about safety, 
these crimes also raise costs for American consumers. Every 
time a store is robbed of products, it has to hire more 
security, replace broken windows, or install new security 
systems; some of those costs are inevitably going to be passed 
on to shoppers.
    It is important that we get to the root of the problem of 
organized retail crime to keep people safe and lower costs for 
everyone across the country. This bipartisan hearing is a 
chance for us to hear from both industry leaders in retail and 
from Federal law enforcement agencies about their efforts to 
combat organized retail crime.
    I want to thank our panelists for joining today and look 
forward to your remarks.
    Without any objection, Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield 
the final 2 minutes of my opening statement to the gentlelady 
from Nevada, Ms. Titus, who has been a leader in Congress on 
this issue.
    [The statement of Ranking Member Magaziner follows:]
    
               Statement of Ranking Member Seth Magaziner
               
                           December 12, 2023
                           
    Many of us have heard from retailers concerned by organized retail 
crime, and so today's hearing is to explore the scope of this problem 
and determine how best to respond.
    Crime overall continues to be at historically low levels and has 
continued to fall in recent years. According to the FBI, between 1993 
and 2022, the violent crime rate across the United States fell by more 
than half, with homicides falling 35 percent, robberies falling 76 
percent, and burglaries falling 78 percent. This trend continues to 
this day. The FBI reports that violent crime decreased 2 percent in 
2022 compared to the previous year.
    However, we must always strive to do better, to ensure that all 
Americans are safe in their homes, their schools, and their 
neighborhoods. We have heard reports of organized retail crime becoming 
more prevalent, which leads us to today's hearing. We all need to 
understand the nature of organized retail crime and the best practices 
for ending it.
    I want to be clear about what we are talking about here. We are not 
talking about ordinary shoplifting committed by individuals working 
alone. We are talking about large, organized groups who engage in 
systematic theft of retail goods and the subsequent resale of stolen 
goods for financial gain.
    Organized retail crime does not just impact large retail companies, 
it also affects mom-and-pop shops and especially retail employees. And, 
beyond the important concerns about safety, these crimes also raise 
costs for American consumers. Every time a store is robbed of products, 
has to hire more security, replace broken windows, or install new 
security systems, some of those costs are going to inevitably be passed 
on to shoppers.
    It is important that we get to the root of the problem of organized 
retail crime, to keep people safe and lower costs for everyone across 
the country. This bipartisan hearing is a chance for us to hear from 
both industry leaders in retail and from Federal law enforcement 
agencies about their efforts to combat organized retail crime.

    Mr. Pfluger. The gentlelady is recognized.
    Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Ranking 
Member Magaziner, for yielding and for holding this important 
hearing.
    I have been deeply involved in this for several Congresses 
as one of the most talked-about issues in my office, from 
business, from law enforcement, and from stakeholders. I 
witnessed this myself as far as from me to you in a Walgreens 
in my district, and we held a roundtable with some 
representatives from law enforcement and business, including 
Home Depot.
    I agree with all that's been said before because we know 
that consumers and employees worry about their own safety. They 
worry about convenience when shopping, and they just worry that 
they're going to get caught up in one of these schemes or 
operations while they're out there during this holiday season.
    In addition, this retail crime that's organized has 
considerable monetary effects on the business and on our 
communities. In Nevada, the Organized Retail Crime Association 
estimates that in 2021 retail product theft cost our State's 
economy about $82 million. No community is immune, you heard, 
from the suburbs to the inner city, from big business to small 
business is particularly troublesome in a real urbanized 
commercial area like my district in downtown Las Vegas. 
Retailers have a strong presence there. They make a large 
contribution to our local economy, and they are targeted.
    The bill that I've introduced, Combatting Organized Retail 
Crime, is bipartisan. There are 47 Republicans, 47 Democrats, 
and every Democrat on this subcommittee is a cosponsor, and I'm 
very proud of that, and I want to thank them for their support.
    I know this hearing will help highlight some of the 
increased trends in high-level organized retail crime and that 
we'll underscore the need for Federal action to allow DHS and 
investigators and prosecutors to have the tools they need to go 
after this organized crime and also the associations, 
organizations, and activities that are tied to it behind the 
scenes that many people don't even realize.
    So thank you again. Thank you for the time, and I look 
forward to hearing our expert witnesses.
    Mr. Magaziner. I yield back. Thank you, Chairman.
    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Ranking Member.
    Other Members of the committee are reminded that opening 
statements may be submitted for the record.
    [The statement of Ranking Member Thompson follows:]
    
             Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson
             
                           December 12, 2023
                           
    Businesses--large and small--across America are increasingly 
concerned about organized retail crime. On the news, we see luxury 
stores being targeted by groups of individuals stealing high-value 
products, but these are not the only targeted businesses. Small 
businesses, which account for 99 percent of businesses across America, 
are also impacted by systematic, large-scale theft or fraud by criminal 
syndicates.
    I have long been an advocate for small businesses. While serving on 
the Committee on Homeland Security, I have consistently tried to 
facilitate dialog between the small business community and the 
Department of Homeland Security and other Federal agencies on how to 
partner together. I have always believed that public-private 
partnerships are critical to success--in many endeavors--and they are 
especially critical to combatting organized retail crime.
    Small business owners and employees are everyday Americans who are 
just trying to serve their communities and make ends meet. Operating a 
small business is hard enough--owners often do not have the bandwidth 
or resources to go up against organized criminal rings looking to steal 
goods. This is where the Federal Government can play a vital role.
    I am heartened by the relationships that have already been forged 
between Government and the retail industry to combat organized retail 
crime. I am pleased that under Operation Boiling Point, Homeland 
Security Investigations (HSI) partners with the National Retail 
Federation (NRF), both of whom are testifying here today.
    And on the matter of Federal and State cooperation, I have always 
been a strong supporter of the Secret Service's National Computer 
Forensics Institute (NCFI). NCFI trains and equips law enforcement 
officers and other Government employees at the State and local level 
with the tools to combat cyber and electric crime, which can include 
retail theft. Last Congress, Committee Democrats led the 
reauthorization of NCFI (H.R. 7174), which was enacted in the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023.
    So, while I know that the three Federal agencies testifying before 
us today already understand the need for collaboration on this issue, I 
am hopeful that today's discussion will foster even stronger 
relationships. From our conversations with industry representatives in 
advance of this hearing, there are ways we can help combat organized 
retail crime.
    For example, we need increased public awareness about what 
organized retail crime is and what it isn't. As the International 
Council of Shopping Centers said in its written testimony, we are not 
talking about single individuals stealing as a result of food 
insecurity, substance abuse, or mental health issues, or for personal 
use. We are talking about methodical criminal enterprises and we need 
to make sure that distinction is made.
    Also, we need more employee education and training. Nothing is more 
important than physical safety. Objects can be replaced. Human lives 
cannot. Retailers should be able to look to law enforcement for 
guidance on how to protect their employees--and their customers--from 
violence resulting from theft incidents.
    I look forward to hearing from our two panels of witnesses today 
about how we meet these needs and ensure the protection of businesses, 
the shopping public, and our communities.

    Mr. Pfluger. I'm pleased to have two distinguished panels 
of witnesses before us today on this very important topic. I 
ask that our first panel rise and please raise their right 
hand.
    Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give 
before the Committee on Homeland Security of the U.S. House of 
Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
but the truth, so help you God?
    Thank you. You may be seated.
    Let the record reflect that the witnesses have answered in 
the affirmative.
    I would now like to formally introduce our first panel:
    Mr. Michael Krol currently serves as a Homeland Security 
Investigations special agent in charge with the New England 
field office in Boston, Massachusetts; Mr. Jason Kane currently 
serves as the special agent in charge of the U.S. Secret 
Service's Nashville District; and, finally, Mr. Jose Perez 
serves as the deputy assistant director of the Transnational 
Organized Crime, Violent Crime, and Operational Support 
Sections of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division.
    Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your 
service to this Nation.
    I'd now like to recognize each of the witnesses. I know you 
have written statements, and we appreciate those. If you could 
summarize that and keep it to 5 minutes.
    Mr. Krol, you are now recognized.

      STATEMENT OF  MICHAEL J. KROL,  SPECIAL AGENT IN 
        CHARGE, HOMELAND SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS,  NEW 
        ENGLAND, U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCE-
        MENT, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

    Mr. Krol. Chairman Pfluger, Ranking Member Magaziner, 
distinguished Members of the subcommittee, thank you for the 
opportunity to appear before you today to discuss Homeland 
Security Investigations' global efforts to combat organized 
retail crime and organized theft groups.
    As the largest investigative agency within the Department 
of Homeland Security, HSI has unique authorities and an 
expansive investigative mandate focused on securing the 
homeland from transnational crime and threats which impact our 
National border and economic security.
    Our 6,800 special agents are stationed in 253 domestic 
field offices and in 93 international offices, while being 
supplemented by nearly 4,000 State, local, Federal, and Tribal 
task force officers, including 14 specialized and vetted host 
country transnational criminal investigative units or TCIUs.
    HSI's operational priorities serve as the foundation of our 
strategic focus, combating financial crime, investigating cyber 
crime, preventing crimes of exploitation and victimization, and 
sharing public safety, upholding fairness in global trade, and 
protecting National security.
    The unlawful activity associated with organized retail 
crime intertwines with many of these aforementioned priorities 
and, therefore, represents an area of our investigative focus.
    In 2022, retail theft was responsible for approximately $72 
billion in losses according to the National Retail Federation. 
In response to this, HSI initiated Operation Boiling Point 2.0 
to effectively communicate the severity of organized theft 
groups involved in retail crime, cargo theft, and other 
systemic thefts.
    Operation Boiling Point 2.0 is a multi-tiered strategy 
focused on, No. 1, integration of efforts using enhanced public 
and private-sector partnerships; No. 2, creating efficiencies 
of scale and data collection in investigative lead 
dissemination; No. 3, using this information to disrupt and 
dismantle ORC and affiliated organizations; and, last, using 
HSI's global reach to engage in a robust public awareness 
campaign to inform and educate consumers and industry on this 
threat among others.
    It is widely recognized that 2lst Century poly-criminal 
networks diversify their criminal portfolios to increase 
profitability and influence. No longer tied to a single 
criminal scheme or enterprise, it is not uncommon for organized 
theft groups to be involved in or affiliated with those 
networks who perpetrate financial fraud, identity theft, human 
smuggling and trafficking, illicit trade, money laundering, 
narcotics and weapons trafficking, among many others.
    One thing remains constant. Organized theft groups, as do 
all criminal networks, must obfuscate the origin of their ill-
gotten gains. The use of traditional and trade-based money-
laundering methods continue, yet digital assets and virtual 
currencies can now be used with relative ease to facilitate the 
immediate movement, concealment, and laundering of illicit 
proceeds.
    Recognizing the complexity of illicit finance, HSI recently 
collaborated with the Association of Certified Anti-Money 
Laundering Specialists to publish a guide for law enforcement 
investigators and financial crime professionals to help combat 
ORC and OTGs.
    Further, HSI's cornerstone outreach interfaces with 
traditional and nontraditional banking in financial 
institutions to continue our long-standing efforts to educate 
our partners on emerging financial threats through anti-money-
laundering training, including typologies of money laundering 
associated with ORC.
    Using existing infrastructure to support our efforts, HSI 
relies on our National Lead Development Center to coordinate 
ORC investigations across the full spectrum of law enforcement 
and private-sector partners. This past year NLDC received 222 
referral requests from State and local law enforcement, in 
addition to private-sector partners. This information led to a 
doubling of HSI investigations from last fiscal year alone.
    As we continue to see cyber-enabled crime, digital assets, 
financial fraud, identity theft, complex global trade 
practices, and other more technical methodologies used in 
organized retail crime, HSI is well-positioned to attack this 
threat head-on.
    Thank you again for your support of HSI and for the 
opportunity to appear before you today. I look forward to your 
questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Krol follows:]
    
                 Prepared Statement of Michael J. Krol
                 
                           December 12, 2023
                           
    Chairman Pfluger, Ranking Member Magaziner, and distinguished 
Members of the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Law Enforcement, and 
Intelligence:

                              introduction
                              
    Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss 
the efforts by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) to combat 
Organized Retail Crime (ORC). My statement focuses on the crucial role 
HSI plays domestically and internationally in identifying, disrupting, 
and dismantling transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) that are 
involved with ORC and related crimes.
    HSI is the principal component of the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) responsible for investigating transnational crime. In 
close collaboration with public and private-sector partners in the 
United States and abroad, HSI special agents diligently work to 
identify and methodically build criminal cases against TCOs, terrorist 
networks, and their facilitators, as well as many other criminal 
elements that threaten the safety and security of our homeland. HSI 
works in conjunction with State and Federal prosecutors to indict and 
arrest violators, execute criminal search warrants, seize currency and 
assets derived from criminal activity, and take other strategic actions 
designed to disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations operating 
throughout the world.
    The HSI Financial Crimes Unit has led HSI's efforts to combat ORC 
and is focused on building partnerships with the retail industry and 
supporting HSI investigations to combat TCOs targeting retail 
businesses and laundering illicit profits. In 2022, HSI initiated 
Operation Boiling Point to underscore and address the severity of 
organized theft groups (OTG) involved in ORC, cargo theft, and other 
systematic thefts. When the Integrity, Notification, and Fairness in 
Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers Act or the INFORM Consumers 
Act came into effect on June 27, 2023, HSI transitioned to Operation 
Boiling Point 2.0, to better communicate and engage with the major e-
commerce platforms, and it is designed to attack ORC from an anti-
money-laundering approach in partnership with the e-commerce platforms 
and the retail sector.

                     orc threats and related crimes

    In 2022, retail theft from both internal and external parties was 
responsible for approximately $72 billion in losses according to the 
National Retail Federation's 2023 most recent Retail Security Survey. 
HSI is targeting OTG's who engage in three types of activities: ORC, 
cargo theft, and other related crimes. HSI defines these terms as:
  <bullet> ORC refers to ``the association of two or more persons 
        engaged in illegally obtaining items of value from retail 
        establishments, through theft and/or fraud, as part of a 
        criminal enterprise.''
  <bullet> Cargo theft is the theft or fraudulent acquisition of goods 
        that are part of an interstate or international shipment and 
        can take place at any point along the supply chain.
  <bullet> Other OTG activity pertains to the theft of valuable items 
        outside the regular supply chain, such as catalytic converters.
    OTGs engage in large-scale theft which relies on criminal networks 
of boosters who steal goods from retailers, cleaners who disguise the 
origins of the stolen merchandise, fencers who resell the products 
through brick-and-mortar fronts and e-commerce websites, and 
professional money launderers who funnel the illicit profits to the 
criminals orchestrating the schemes. In order to realize higher 
profits, many of the stolen items are shipped to foreign markets or 
sold via dark web or other gray market websites that have lower or no 
standards of retail product authenticity verification. Those illicit 
profits need to be laundered to be realized and used by TCOs. The 
laundering of these illicit proceeds involves the exploitation of the 
financial system, bulk cash smuggling, and trade-based money-laundering 
schemes--a system now dominated by Chinese-based Money Laundering 
Organizations (CMLOs). The CMLOs that are laundering the proceeds from 
ORC are the same organizations that are laundering the illicit proceeds 
from the sale of narcotics, to include fentanyl by Mexican-based drug 
cartels.

             hsi's role in combating organized retail crime
             
    HSI conducts investigations targeting organized theft groups based 
on the interstate and international transportation of stolen goods and 
the corresponding movement of illicit proceeds from the sale of these 
stolen goods. While HSI's investigative portfolio is extensive and 
diverse, financial investigations are at the core of every 
investigative program area. TCOs, terrorist organizations, and the 
myriad of criminal networks have grown increasingly more sophisticated 
in their approach to concealing their criminal acts, while also 
morphing operations to the perceived anonymity of the Darknet. 
Traditional money-laundering methods remain; yet, cryptocurrency can 
now be used with relative ease to facilitate any type of illicit 
activity. HSI's financial investigative authorities and unique 
capabilities specifically enable us to identify, dismantle, and disrupt 
the criminal enterprises that threaten our Nation's economy and 
security. One of the most effective methods utilized to identify, 
dismantle, and disrupt organizations engaged in retail crime is to 
target the illicit movement of proceeds gained through their efforts. 
We also target transnational criminal gangs and other TCOs committing 
ORC and other crimes related to illicit trade, travel, and finance.
    HSI is utilizing its National Lead Development Center (NLDC) to 
coordinate ORC investigations with HSI field offices; other Federal 
partners to include the United States Secret Service, the United States 
Postal Service, as well as others; State and local law enforcement; 
private-sector loss prevention/asset protection components; and 
insurers. In fiscal year 2023, the NLDC received 222 requests for 
investigation from State/local law enforcement and the private sector 
on thefts resulting in a combined $51 million in ORC losses.
    HSI's ORC investigations focus on the higher tiers of OTGs. These 
investigations target the often-violent individuals profiting from the 
thefts. HSI investigations have uncovered several TCOs involved in ORC. 
One such example is the South American Theft Groups (SATGs), which 
include organizations based in Colombia, Chile, and other countries. 
These groups recruit members and facilitate travel into the United 
States for individuals who then commit strategic thefts of high-value 
electronic devices. Items are stolen, consolidated, shipped to another 
location in the United States, and ultimately illicitly exported to 
foreign countries. An additional example of OTGs are Romanian-organized 
theft groups (ROTG) that recruit individuals from Eastern Europe to 
travel to the United States to commit various types of crimes, 
including retail theft and access device fraud. A recent HSI 
investigation in Missouri revealed an ROTG, comprised of previously-
deported individuals, that wired illicit proceeds to Romania and other 
international destinations.
    As part of the DOJ's Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces 
(OCDETF) Program, the International Organized Crime, Intelligence and 
Operations Center (IOC-2) leverages its unique capabilities and 
resources from the Special Operations Unit and the OCDETF Fusion Center 
to provide comprehensive intelligence products, case support and 
deconfliction to HSI offices in support of OTG investigations. In 
fiscal year 2023, HSI and IOC-2 held a case coordination meeting 
between HSI field offices and local law enforcement to deconflict 
investigations and share typologies of SATGs operating in multiple 
jurisdictions across the United States.
    HSI's National Targeting Center--Investigations (NTC-I) Unit was 
established in December 2013, in collaboration with U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection (CBP), to enhance our shared border security mission. 
HSI's collaborative presence at the National Targeting Center (NTC) 
supports the entire border security continuum, from CBP interdictions 
and HSI investigations, to the joint exploitation of intelligence. NTC-
I facilitates the identification and disruption of SATGs.
    In fiscal year 2023, HSI created a working group with U.S. Secret 
Service (USSS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Enforcement 
and Removal Operations, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and 
CBP's NTC to prevent suspected SATG and ROTG members from entering the 
United States and to target those that had previously entered. In 
addition, HSI, USSS, and the NTC are targeting imported shipments of 
parts used to assemble ``card skimmers,'' which are commonly used by 
ROTGs to commit access device fraud and steal millions of dollars from 
States' Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs.
    The National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (IPR 
Center) was created by HSI in 2010 and codified into law in the Trade 
Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. The IPR Center brings 
together a multitude of domestic and international partners, including 
the retail industry, in a task force setting at the forefront of the 
U.S. Government's response to combating global intellectual property 
theft and enforcing international trade laws. The IPR Center attacks 
vulnerabilities in the global supply chain to further secure the 
border, facilitate legitimate trade, and dismantle criminal 
organizations engaged in trade crimes. The IPR Center has over a decade 
of experience investigating how TCO's exploit on-line marketplaces to 
peddle counterfeit items and other illicit goods and served as a model 
for HSI's Operation Boiling Point.

                      hsi's strategy to combat orc
                      
    Through Operation Boiling Point 2.0, HSI is targeting OTGs 
utilizing theft, and in some cases fraud, as a means to profit from 
criminal activity.
    HSI continues to establish, foster, and maintain public and 
private-sector partnerships to combat OTGs. HSI recognizes the 
invaluable role of industry partnerships, to include retail, freight 
transportation, banking, and other business sectors, which may be 
targeted by OTGs or utilized by OTGs to facilitate their criminal 
activities. HSI has also developed relationships with several regional 
Organized Retail Crime Associations throughout the United States. To 
highlight the importance of public and private-sector partnerships, HSI 
collaborated with the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering 
Specialists to publish a guide for law enforcement investigators and 
anti-financial crime professionals to help combat ORC and OTGs.
    Over the past 2 decades, HSI has established a strong record of 
working collaboratively with banks. For example, HSI's Operation 
Cornerstone is a comprehensive and proactive outreach initiative that 
ensures financial institutions are informed of the latest money-
laundering techniques.
    In terms of e-commerce and on-line marketplaces, under Operation 
Boiling Point 2.0, HSI will adapt our Cornerstone outreach program to 
meet the needs of e-commerce and on-line marketplaces. This will 
include educating on-line marketplaces on the latest criminal trends 
and providing direct access to HSI investigative support and personnel 
when fraud is suspected. HSI anticipates some high-volume third-party 
sellers of stolen goods will gravitate toward new or existing 
marketplaces that do not comply with the recently-passed INFORM 
Consumers Act. However, through the concerted efforts of law 
enforcement agencies within the United States and around the world, 
there are fewer and fewer dark corners of the internet where cyber 
criminals can operate when denied access to legitimate platforms.
    HSI continues to obtain, develop, and provide intelligence and 
investigative leads to our HSI field offices and State and local law 
enforcement. Through our strategic partnerships, HSI receives and 
disseminates actionable leads to HSI criminal analysts and special 
agents across 253 domestic field offices and 86 international offices 
to identify criminal networks and develop investigations.
    HSI continues to advance criminal investigations to disrupt and 
dismantle OTGs. HSI recognizes the importance of collaboration with 
Federal, State, and local law enforcement and prosecutors, as well as 
regional task forces, to combat the ORC threat. OTGs operating 
domestically and abroad may commit retail theft, cargo theft, and 
related crimes across several jurisdictions, which requires 
investigators to share information and pool resources to effectively 
disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations impacting our communities. 
The HSI domestic footprint is supplemented by approximately 3,700 task 
force officers representing key strategic Federal, State, and local 
partners in the fight to combat TCOs.
    As the final component of this initiative, HSI launched a robust 
public awareness campaign in coordination with our partners. Since its 
launch, HSI has participated in over 50 events and meetings discussing 
Operation Boiling Point 2.0 with over 4,000 attendees and stakeholders 
from 29 States.

                         investigative results
                         
    In fiscal year 2023, HSI initiated 199 OTG cases, which represents 
an increase of over 107 percent from fiscal year 2022. As shown in the 
following table, seizures have increased over 227 percent, arrests have 
increased 159 percent, and indictments have increased 189 percent 
related to ORC investigations in fiscal year 2023, from fiscal year 
2022 levels.

Operation King of the Mountain
    In August 2022, HSI Charlotte worked with CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, 
Publix, and Target retailers to identify an ORC ring operating in North 
Carolina. The retailers provided information about the means and 
methods of the ORC ring and requested HSI's assistance to disrupt and 
dismantle the organization. HSI identified an individual receiving 
stolen property from ``boosters'' and two known warehouse-style storage 
facilities storing the stolen merchandise that was later sold on eBay 
and Amazon.
    HSI Charlotte executed 4 search warrants and have arrested 4 
individuals including the main suspect. The operation resulted in the 
seizure of 28 firearms to include four AR-15 rifles, 6 suppressors, 
more than 20,000 rounds of assorted ammunition, and $167,389.31 in 
stolen merchandise recovered.

Operation At the Card Wash
    In September of this year a multi-year investigation lead by HSI 
Los Angeles concluded after members of a TCO plead guilty to conspiracy 
to commit money laundering and other charges. The investigation 
identified a network of wholesale electronics distributors engaged in 
trade-based money-laundering by sourcing merchandise derived from 
various fraud schemes and exploiting the use of gift cards to launder 
or mask criminally-derived funds. As an example, a phone scam victim is 
coerced, under false pretenses, into purchasing and providing gift 
cards and access codes to scammers over the phone which are ultimately 
transmitted to straw-purchasers or ``runners,'' who utilize the cards 
for transactions to purchase high-value consumer electronics or new 
gift cards at retail stores.
    The investigation led to the Federal indictment of four defendants 
related to a scheme to launder gift cards purchased by scam victims. 
The indictment alleged that the defendants obtained more than 5,000 
gift cards from a group that called itself the ``Magic Lamp,'' and sold 
gift card information via an on-line messenger application. Through the 
purchases and other transactions at multiple retail stores, the 
defendants and their co-conspirators sought to conceal the fact that 
the gift cards had been originally funded with fraudulent proceeds. 
Customs records indicated that between August 2019 and November 2020, a 
business operated by one defendant exported merchandise with a total 
declared value of over $13 million, consisting of iPads, cell phones, 
AirPods, and Apple watches, to recipients in Hong Kong. In September, 
after a 10-day trial, three defendants were found guilty of conspiracy 
to commit money laundering. A January 2024, sentencing hearing has been 
set at which time the defendants will face a statutory maximum sentence 
of 20 years in Federal prison for each money-laundering conspiracy 
count. The fourth defendant pled guilty and is currently serving a 
Federal prison sentence. This case was prosecuted by the United States 
Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.
    These investigations demonstrate the scope of OTG activities that 
victimize our communities and highlight the HSI strategic and vital 
role in investigating ORC, cargo theft, and related crimes to disrupt 
and dismantle OTGs. These cases also illustrate the importance of 
public and private partnerships, and law enforcement coordination 
across jurisdictions.

                               conclusion

    The United States remains a desirable target for TCOs that seek to 
profit from systematic theft and fraud. Through its unique authorities, 
capabilities, and strategic partnerships, HSI seeks to disrupt and 
dismantle OTGs that exploit the United States economy and pose a public 
safety risk to our communities.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today and 
for your continued support of HSI and our enduring efforts to secure 
our borders and protect the American people from the criminal 
organizations targeting our homeland. I look forward to your questions.

    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Mr. Krol.
    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Kane for your opening 
statement.

        STATEMENT OF JASON D. KANE,  SPECIAL AGENT  IN CHARGE, 
          NASHVILLE FIELD OFFICE, U.S. SECRET SERVICE, DEPART-
          MENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

    Mr. Kane. Thank you.
    Chairman Pfluger, Ranking Member Magaziner, and 
distinguished Members of the subcommittee, thank you for 
inviting me to testify before you on the current investigative 
capabilities of the U.S. Secret Service and how they may be of 
help addressing the trend of organized retail crime.
    As one of the Nation's original investigative agencies, the 
Secret Service has been charged with safeguarding the Nation's 
financial systems since 1865. This includes conducting criminal 
investigations to protect the American public, financial 
institutions, and critical infrastructure from criminal 
exploitation.
    Over time these investigations have evolved from 
traditional counterfeit in Civil War to crimes related to 
electronic fund transfers that became popular in the 1980's. 
Today we have extensive authorities to safeguard financial 
payment systems from criminal exploitation even if those 
specific activities are increasingly transnational in nature 
and enabled by cyber space and digital currencies.
    The Secret Service's primary area of focus with respect to 
combatting organized retail crime are in training our State and 
local partners and providing shared resources in the form of 
technical tools. We aid our partners in our specialized ability 
to track and seize illicit funds, often in the form of digital 
assets which were used by transnational criminal organizations 
to conceal and transfer their ill-gotten gains.
    The Secret Service has an exceptional record of success in 
disrupting transnational criminal organizations and will remain 
committed to keeping pace with both technology and innovation 
and the evolving tactics of cyber criminals.
    Based on our efforts, we've prevented $2.6 billion in fraud 
in fiscal year 2022. These losses are victim-based and 
attributable crimes such as business email compromises, 
pandemic-related fraud, romance scams, and stealing personal 
information via dark web marketplaces.
    The aid to Secret Service and our continued law enforcement 
partnerships, last December Congress renewed its commitment to 
the National Computer Forensic Institute by passing legislation 
that allowed for its continued operation through the end of 
fiscal year 2028. The legislation is to strengthen our 
capabilities at the Secret Service and our law enforcement 
partners to combat cyber-enabled crime, including organized 
retail crime. One of the on-going efforts are the Cyber Fraud 
Task Force which is directly funded by Congress to provide a 
forensic working environment to support criminal cases. These 
tasks forces are in 42 offices across the United States. 
Through them we work closely with the U.S. Attorney's Office 
and law enforcement agencies to ensure that our partners have 
the most relevant information on criminal trends and tactics 
used by organized criminal groups.
    Our well-established and -trusted relationships with 
finance institutions stemming from our origins in combating 
counterfeit currency affords us the agility to aid with cases 
involving organized retail crime. We are fully engaged with our 
partners. This partnership is essential to accomplishing our 
mission.
    Organized retail crime is a crime of opportunity, and 
criminals exploit this in both the physical and cyber-enabled 
space. Efforts to stay ahead of transnational criminal 
organizations and their capabilities are paramount to helping 
deter future crimes. While organized retail crime is not a 
traditional area of focus for Federal law enforcement, the 
capabilities of organized groups to commit these crimes is 
evident based on the reported annual losses of over $100 
billion.
    The immediate investigative focus of the Secret Service is 
to disrupt and deter criminal activity and recovering any funds 
stolen from Americans. Longer term we'll work to ensure those 
who have criminally exploited our businesses are arrested and 
successfully prosecuted forthwith.
    Cyber-enabled crimes are often transnational and 
multijurisdictional in nature which is why Federal assistance 
in many times is not only warranted, it's essential.
    Based on the current trends related to organized retail 
crime, I will assent the following five principles should help 
inform Congressional efforts to address organized retail crime.
    One is resourcing. Resourcing is essential to law 
enforcement's ability to effectively detect, investigate, and 
arrest those committing these crimes. These must be constant 
and consistent, not just a reactive measure.
    Prioritizing, identifying, and seizing assets to prevent 
illicit profit and recover victim financial losses. If 
criminals can enjoy their profits, there will be no crime--or 
more crime.
    Continue to strengthen the ability of stakeholders to 
prevent, detect, and investigate crimes by investigating local 
law enforcement through Federal programs such as the Secret 
Service's National Computer Forensic Institute. This bill is a 
collaborative for relationships necessary to address organized 
retail crime and know the cyber neighborhood crimes.
    Partnerships between law enforcement and the private sector 
are essential. We often say build trust before you need it as 
this is vital for an effective response from law enforcement.
    Last, ensure legal authorities that control law enforcement 
activities keep pace with criminal trends.
    I'm honored to represent the dedicated men and women of the 
Secret Service here today. They work tirelessly on behalf of 
the American people and continue to maintain our standing as 
one of the world's premiere law enforcement organizations.
    The Secret Service appreciates your partnership and your 
guidance, and I will now welcome any questions that you have.
    Thank you.

    Chairman Pfluger, Ranking Member Magaziner, and distinguished 
Members of this subcommittee: Thank you for inviting me to testify 
before you on the current investigative capabilities of the U.S. Secret 
Service (Secret Service) and how they may be of help addressing the 
rising trend of organized retail crime (ORC).\1\

    As one of the Nation's original investigative agencies, charged 
with safeguarding the Nation's financial and payment systems, the 
Secret Service has, since 1865, conducted criminal investigations to 
protect the American public, financial institutions, and critical 
infrastructure from criminal exploitation. As early as 1982, the 
Secretary of the Treasury directed the Secret Service to investigate 
crimes related to electronic funds transfers to keep pace with the 
growing role of computers in the U.S. financial system. Today, we have 
extensive authorities to safeguard financial payment systems from 
criminal exploitation, even as those illicit activities are 
increasingly transnational in nature and enabled by cyber space and 
digital currencies.
    I currently serve as the special agent in charge of the Nashville 
Field Office with oversight of middle and eastern Tennessee. In my 
former role as a deputy assistant director, I helped drive our 
investigative focus and priorities supporting our 161 field offices. I 
drafted polices for our offices to deploy, but now I implement those 
polices to deter, disrupt, and ultimately prosecute actors involved in 
transnational criminal organizations (TCOs).
    In executing our law enforcement mission, the Secret Service 
closely partners with Federal, State, local, Tribal, Territorial, and 
international law enforcement agencies. We do this in part through our 
network of Cyber Fraud Task Forces (CFTFs)\2\ which are strategically 
placed in major cities across the United States. In criminal 
investigations involving digital currency, we partner particularly 
closely with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Federal Bureau of 
Investigations (FBI), the Department of Justice, and other Federal 
agencies with related responsibilities as well as State and local law 
enforcement partners.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ Section 105 of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 directed the Secret 
Service to establish a ``a national network of electronic crimes task 
forces, . . . for the purpose of preventing, detecting, and 
investigating various forms of electronic crimes, including potential 
terrorist attacks against critical infrastructure and financial payment 
systems.'' The first Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force (ECTF) 
was established in New York in 1995; today the Secret Service operates 
42 domestic CFTFs, as part of an expanding international network that 
partners Federal, State, and local law enforcement with the private 
sector and academia to effectively investigate cyber crimes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Secret Service's primary areas of focus with respect to 
combating organized retail crime are in training our State and local 
partners, providing shared resources in the form of technical tools, 
and utilizing our specialized abilities to track and seize illicit 
funds, often in the form of cryptocurrencies, which are used by TCOs to 
conceal and transfer their ill-gotten gains. The Secret Service has an 
exceptional record of success in disrupting TCOs, and we remain 
committed to keeping pace with both technology innovation and the 
evolving strategies and tactics of cyber criminals. My testimony today 
will explain our efforts, and the challenges we face, in addressing 
organized retail crime and related criminal activity.

         impact of national computer forensics institute (ncfi)
         
    The Secret Service identified the availability of cyber-related 
training and equipment at the State, local, and Tribal levels as an 
issue in the early 2000's. Established in 2008, through a partnership 
initiative between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the 
Secret Service, and the Alabama District Attorneys Association, the 
NCFI has trained more than 24,000 State, local, Tribal, and Territorial 
(SLTT) law enforcement, prosecutors, and judicial officials. Trainees 
hail from more than 4,700 agencies throughout all 50 States and 5 U.S. 
territories. Since 2017, the NCFI has issued more than $122 million in 
computer equipment to SLTT digital forensics examiners. This equipment 
is sent back to SLTT departments and used to investigate a wide 
spectrum of crime, to include retail crime.
    The impact of the NCFI's training mission on SLTT law enforcement 
partners is evident first-hand through the Forensic Partner Reporting 
program. Graduates of NCFI's forensic examiner courses utilize Secret 
Service-issued equipment to conduct examinations in a wide range of 
criminal investigations across the Nation, and report back on their 
work. Reporting for fiscal year 2023 is at an all-time high, reflecting 
that SLTT partners conducted over 200,000 exams and analyzed more than 
35 petabytes of data, which is the equivalent of 700 million four-
drawer file cabinets full of data. More than half of all exams reported 
involved violent crime investigations, to include homicide, robbery, 
rape, and child exploitation.
    Cases today revolve around the ability to prove guilt in a cyber 
environment. I would submit to you that 25 years ago cases regularly 
hinged on biological DNA evidence as the pillar of a prosecution. 
Today, cases also regularly rely on ``computer DNA'' or ``digital 
dust'' from computer forensics to show the pattern and intent of 
criminal actors and their networks. Without this type of evidence, many 
criminal actors may go free or receive limited sentences as the full 
degree of their culpability is not discovered. Last year, Congress 
renewed its commitment to the NCFI program by passing legislation that 
expanded this program and allowed for its continued operation through 
the end of fiscal year 2028. This legislation has strengthened the 
capabilities of the Secret Service and our law enforcement partners to 
combat modern criminal activity, including organized retail crime.

                 cyber fraud task forces & partnerships
                 
    Our Cyber Fraud Task Forces are connected with U.S. Attorneys' 
Offices and other Federal SLTT counterparts in every jurisdiction to 
ensure that our partners have the most relevant information on criminal 
trends and tactics used by organized criminal groups. Our well-
established and trusted relationships with financial institutions, 
stemming from our origins in combatting the spread of counterfeit 
currency, affords us the agility to aid with cases involving organized 
retail crime. We are fully engaged with our partners, as partnership is 
essential to accomplishing our mission.
    We work daily with partners in the financial sector, such as FinCEN 
and the National Cyber-Forensics Training Alliance (NCFTA), to identify 
trends throughout the country. We issue advisories to financial 
institutions as new information is developed, to include ways to 
prevent and mitigate fraudulent schemes. While the fight remains, a 
tangible example of our CFTF capabilities were shown during the COVID-
19 pandemic, where we seized and returned over $1.65 billion in 
fraudulently-obtained Small Business Administration loans and 
unemployment insurance benefits and arrested more than 670 individuals.
    Last, to ensure we are an effective partner to the private sector, 
we have placed renewed emphasis on public outreach. One item I have 
personally learned in my tenure with this agency is that our private-
sector partners are in this fight with us. We have increased our 
outreach initiatives in the form of podcasts, in-person briefings, and 
our first-ever citizens academy, which was hosted by our Dallas Field 
Office just a few months ago.\3\ Addressing cyber-enabled crime is a 
team sport, and we rely heavily on close collaboration with 
stakeholders, just as we do when we complete our protective mission.

                                strategy
                                
    The Office of Investigations Strategy, fiscal year 2021-2027, 
identifies the following three objectives to safeguard U.S. financial 
systems:
    1. Detect, investigate, and arrest those committing financial 
        crimes.
    2. Identify and seize assets to prevent illicit profit and recover 
        victim financial losses.
    3. Strengthen the ability of stakeholders to prevent financial 
        crimes.
    It is in the second category that I believe may be of particular 
interest to this committee. It is an area the Secret Service has and 
continues to devote extraordinary effort to staff, resource, and train 
our personnel to address. I am pleased to report this fight is one the 
Secret Service takes on daily, and we have numerous examples of how our 
strategies are working. Based on our efforts, we prevented over $2.6 
billion in fraud in fiscal year 2022.\4\ These losses are victim-based 
and attributable to crimes such a Business Email Compromises (BECs), 
romance scams, and stolen personal information via Dark Web 
marketplaces.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ USSS Annual Report, fiscal year 2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Without effective law enforcement intervention, consumers will bear 
the brunt of higher cost for items based on the acts of criminal 
groups. These criminals are not only defrauding retailers but also 
impeding the availability of commerce as retailers are unable to fight 
the problem alone.

                         investigative efforts
                         
    The immediate investigative focus of the Secret Service is to 
disrupt and deter criminal activity and to recover any funds stolen 
from Americans. Longer-term, we work to ensure that those who have 
criminally exploited our businesses are arrested and successfully 
prosecuted. Cyber-enabled crimes are often transnational and multi-
jurisdictional in nature, which is why Federal assistance is many times 
not only warranted, but it is essential.
    While much of our casework does not directly involve retail theft, 
we support efforts to counter ORC through our investigations involving 
the illegal movement of money. Today, much of that money laundering is 
facilitated through digital assets. I think back to a case involving 
Liberty Reserve, which was designed to facilitate illegal transactions 
and launder the proceeds of various crimes.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While we shut down Liberty Reserve in 2013, just last month, the 
Secret Service worked with a cryptocurrency company to freeze $225 
million worth of assets related to a transnational criminal scheme.\6\ 
It is the intention of the Secret Service to seize the funds associated 
with illegal activity in this case and return as much as possible to 
victims. In fiscal year 2022 and 2023, we returned over $570 million to 
victims of crime. Our actions to address illicit financial activity 
will undoubtably deal a financial blow to those engaged in ORC by 
limiting their ability to use the proceeds from selling stolen items.

                        operation urban justice
                        
    In late 2022, the Secret Service entered a prolific investigation 
involving the State of California and the theft of Electronic Benefit 
Transfer (EBT) benefits. The EBT program was being exploited by 
organized crime groups and the direct losses at the time of case 
inception was approximately $90 million. This coordinated effort sought 
to target transnational organized criminals who were skimming EBT cards 
from local retailers and using the stolen numbers to steal funds from 
the intended beneficiaries who rely upon these subsistence benefits. 
The operation itself combined the efforts of over 400 law enforcement 
personnel from USSS, HSI, DOJ, and our California State and local 
partners. The State was also losing around $9 million a month as the 
criminal groups were exploiting the monthly benefits as they were 
loaded onto the true recipient's accounts.
    Operation Urban Justice was conducted on March 1, 2023, and yielded 
15 Federal arrests, over $100K in cash seized, 40 encoded cards, and 
numerous cell phones used for the operation which we have now used to 
identify additional elements of the TCO. This effort required the use 
of artificial intelligence-based technologies and data analytics to 
wade through reams of financial and video data from months of 
exploitation by these TCOs. The Secret Service will continue to go 
after those who will use the Governmental programs designed for the 
intended beneficiaries who rely upon these subsistence benefits and 
hold them accountable. This is a tailored example of how we address 
TCOs daily.

                               challenges

    While the Secret Service does not have a lead role in the effort to 
fight organized retail crime, this crime does have commonality with 
other contemporary crimes in the use of computers, transnational co-
conspirators, and the illicit financial activity. These groups are 
commonly technically savvy and know how to move their funds outside of 
the purview of traditional money-laundering pathways. This is no longer 
the days of Sammy ``The Bull'' Gravano laundering quarters through 
laundromats; this is moving millions of dollars' worth of assets 
transnationally and electronically within seconds.
    One area where Congress could help is by amending 18 U.S.C.  3056 
to authorize the Secret Service to investigate those involved in 
criminal violations of 18 U.S.C.  1960, and related illicit financial 
activity occurring in financial institutions which are regulated under 
the Bank Secrecy Act, but do not meet the definition of ``Federally-
insured financial institution'' under Title 18 of the U.S. Code.\7\ In 
May 2023, DHS sent the proposed amendment to 18 U.S.C.  1960 to 
Congress for consideration. The Secret Service continues to engage 
members of both the House and Senate, to explain the purpose and nature 
of this legislation. In short, our financial systems, and our mission, 
has evolved since 1865, and our authorities must keep pace so we can 
effectively address new forms of illicit activity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ Reference the definition of ``financial institution'' in 31 
U.S.C.  5312, compared to the definition in 18 U.S.C.  20, and the 
phrase ``Federally-insured financial institution'' used in 18 U.S.C.  
3056(b)(3).

                               conclusion
                               
    In conclusion, I am honored to represent the dedicated men and 
women of the Secret Service here today. They work tirelessly on behalf 
of the American people and continue to maintain our standing as one of 
the world's preeminent law enforcement organizations.
    The Secret Service will continue to partner with HSI to hold 
criminals accountable and seize illicit gains to deter further criminal 
activities and compensate victims. At the same time, the Secret Service 
will continue to be on the leading edge of evolving threats targeting 
the financial infrastructure, a post we have held since 1865.
    I truly appreciate the chance to represent the Secret Service and 
discuss some of the ways we can aid in the pursuit of cyber-enabled 
crime, including organized retail crime. The Secret Service appreciates 
your partnership and guidance, and I welcome any questions the 
committee may have.

statements of 5 minutes.

    STATEMENT  OF  JOSE  A. PEREZ,  DEPUTY  ASSISTANT  DIREC-
      TOR, CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION, FBI, U.S. DEPART-
      MENT OF JUSTICE

    Mr. Perez. Good afternoon, Chairman Pfluger, Ranking Member 
Magaziner, and Members of the committee. It's my pleasure to be 
here today to speak to you on organized retail theft, more 
specifically the FBI's Major Theft Program.
    As noted, my name is Jose Perez. I'm the deputy assistant 
director in the Criminal Investigative Division. Under my 
investigative responsibility, I have various programs, 
including the Violent Crime and Gang Program, Crimes Against 
Children, and specifically for this committee transnational 
organized crime, which includes our Major Theft Program.
    The FBI has a long and rich history combatting organized 
crime, and we continue to dedicate resources to combat that 
threat. We use an intelligence-driven approach to identify, 
disrupt, and dismantle the most egregious TOC actors. Criminal 
organizations are diverse in trade and employ a myriad of 
criminal activities, ranging from trafficking in narcotics, 
firearms, and/or persons. It's a fraud and major theft.
    The FBI is aware of the continually evolving trend of 
organized retail threat. We prioritize efforts to combat this 
threat by working with our law enforcement partners to identify 
these organizations, disrupt them, and dismantle them using the 
enterprise theory of investigation and employ sophisticated 
investigative techniques.
    Retail theft consists mostly of several State crimes that 
can quickly evolve into activities used to proliferate 
transnational organized crime when stolen goods are transported 
across State lines or even internationally or when illicit 
goods--illicit proceeds from retail crimes are used to fund 
other transnational criminal activity.
    To better support these investigations, the FBI partners 
with State, local, and Federal law enforcement around the 
country through our various task force initiatives to combat 
both violent crime and organized crime. The FBI leads several 
major task forces around the country that are dedicated toward 
defeating these criminal organizations involved in interstate 
transportation of stolen goods.
    Some of the challenges in investigating organized retail 
theft is that most of these crimes often appear as State 
offenses, things like shoplifting, that immediately are not 
reported to the FBI and may not have clear connections to 
transnational criminal organizations.
    To address this challenge, the FBI continually partners 
with State and local law enforcement to share intelligence on 
crime trends and patterns to create better networks to identify 
criminal actors.
    Just this past April, FBI Boston's Organized Crime Task 
Force arrested 7 members of an organized theft crew. The 
investigation resulted in collaboration by over 70 police 
departments throughout the New England area. Several members of 
the crew were arrested in connection with thefts throughout the 
region, including catalytic converters stolen from over 470 
vehicles, cash from automatic teller machines, and merchandise 
from jewelry stores. The crew was allegedly responsible for an 
estimated $2 million in losses throughout the Massachusetts and 
New Hampshire area between 2022 and 2023. Several of these 
defendants have been convicted, and the FBI continues to 
partner with State and local law enforcement agencies in these 
types of cases.
    In addition to the Major Theft Program, we also dedicate 
resources toward retail theft through things like our authority 
to investigate Hobbs Act violations. In these cases the dollar 
amount is less important than the overall impact to the 
community when the theft is facilitated through violence. These 
crimes might have a lower financial loss associated with them, 
but the larger impact on the community, in addition to the 
impact on interstate and foreign commerce, is significant.
    Additionally, the FBI actively participates in outreach and 
partnerships to the retail industry and private-sector 
partners. We attend various conferences, such as the National 
Retail Federation Conference. We maintain private-sector 
outreach efforts through our office of private sector and 
offices of private engagement and also through FBI headquarters 
and our 56 field offices around the country. These 
relationships and industry events are important to maintain 
active communication, information sharing, and coordination 
between FBI and retail partners.
    While recent smash-and-grab robberies have garnered much 
media attention, the FBI also focuses on investigating and 
disrupting complex theft schemes involving targeted retail 
theft of high-dollar items, such as sophisticated fraud schemes 
and to steal commercial cargo loads.
    We work closely with private sector to develop a strategic 
cargo theft initiative and address the growth in cargo theft 
and supply chain theft. In March 2023, CargoNet, an industry 
association, reported a 600 percent increase in strategic cargo 
theft. Some of these cargo theft schemes include identity theft 
and fraud and cyber-enabled fraud such as business email 
compromise.
    The FBI has also initiated an initiative targeting South 
American theft groups involving groups coming from Chile and 
other South American countries exploiting things like visa 
waiver program and visa entries to commit crimes and return 
back to the countries and share some of the proceeds and sell 
some of the proceeds internationally.
    I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the committee 
today, and I look forward to answering any of your questions.

                           December 12, 2023
                           
    Good morning, Chairman Pfluger and Members of the subcommittee, and 
thank you for inviting me here to talk to you about Organized Retail 
Theft, and more specifically the FBI's Major Theft program.
    My name is Jose Perez. I am a deputy assistant director within the 
FBI Criminal Investigative Division, or CID. In my position I oversee 
various investigative programs for the FBI, including Violent Crime and 
Gangs, Crimes Against Children, and Transnational Organized Crime, or 
TOC, which I will focus on today as that includes our Major Theft 
Program.
    The FBI has a long and rich history combating Organized Crime, and 
we continue to dedicate resources to combat Organized Crime by using an 
intelligence-driven approach to identify, disrupt, and dismantle the 
most egregious TOC actors. Criminal organizations are diverse in trade 
and employ myriad criminal activities ranging from trafficking 
narcotics, firearms, and/or persons to fraud and Major Theft. The FBI 
is aware of the continually-evolving trend of Organized Retail Theft 
and we prioritize efforts to combat it by working with our law 
enforcement partners to identify these organizations, dismantle them 
using an enterprise theory of investigation, and employ sophisticated 
investigative techniques.
    While retail theft consists mostly of State crimes, it can quickly 
evolve into activities used to proliferate transnational organized 
crime, when stolen goods are transported across State lines or even 
internationally, or when illicit proceeds from retail crime are used to 
fund other transnational criminal activity. To better support these 
investigations, the FBI partners with State, local, and Federal 
partners around the country through various task force initiatives to 
combat both violent crime and organized crime. The FBI leads several 
Major Theft task forces around the country that are dedicated toward 
defeating criminal organizations involved in interstate transportation 
of stolen goods.
    One of the challenges with investigating Organized Retail Theft is 
that most of these crimes appear initially as State offenses, such as 
shoplifting, that are not ordinarily reported to the FBI and may not 
have clear connection to a transnational criminal organization. To 
address this challenge, the FBI continually partners with State and 
local law enforcement to share intelligence on crime trends and 
patterns and create better networks to identify the criminal actors.
    Just this past April, FBI Boston's Organized Crime Task Force 
arrested 7 members of an organized theft crew. Over 70 local police 
departments throughout New England contributed to this investigation. 
The members of the organized theft crew were arrested in connection 
with thefts across the region, including catalytic converters stolen 
from over 470 vehicles, cash from automatic teller machines, and 
merchandise from jewelry stores. This crew is allegedly responsible for 
an estimated $2 million in losses from thefts across Massachusetts and 
New Hampshire from 2022 to 2023. The defendants were charged with 
conspiracy to transport stolen property in interstate commerce and 
interstate transportation of stolen property. To date, 5 members of the 
crew have plead guilty.
    In addition to the Major Theft program, the FBI also dedicates 
efforts toward Retail Theft through its authority to investigate Hobbs 
Act violations. In those cases, the dollar amount is less important 
than the overall impact to the community, when theft is facilitated 
through violence. These crimes might have a lower financial loss 
associated with them, but a larger impact on communities and greater 
impact on interstate and foreign commerce.
    Additionally, the FBI actively participates in outreach and 
partnerships with the retail industry and private-sector partners. The 
FBI attends various conferences, such as the National Retail Federation 
(NRF) conference, and maintains private-sector outreach efforts through 
the FBI's Office of Private Sector, Office of Partner Engagement, and 
throughout our 56 FBI Field Offices. These relationships and industry 
events are important to maintain active communication, information 
sharing, and coordination between the FBI and retail partners.
    While recent ``smash-and-grab'' type robberies have garnered much 
of the media attention, the FBI also focuses on investigating and 
disrupting the more complex theft schemes involving targeted retail 
theft of high-dollar items, such as sophisticated fraud schemes to 
steal commercial cargo loads. The FBI is working closely with the 
private sector to develop a Strategic Cargo Theft Initiative and 
address the growth in Cargo Theft and Supply Chain Theft. In March 
2023, Cargonet (an industry association dedicated to the prevention and 
investigation of cargo theft) reported a 600 percent annual increase in 
strategic cargo theft. Strategic cargo theft involves the use of fraud 
and deceptive information to deceive shippers, brokers, and carriers to 
give loads to criminal actors instead of legitimate carriers and can 
involve both identity theft and cyber-enabled fraud such as Business 
Email Compromise.
    Additionally, the FBI has an initiative targeting South American 
Theft Groups, which involves individuals from Chile and other South 
American countries exploiting tourist visas to travel in and out of the 
United States to facilitate theft and transport of stolen goods 
internationally. The FBI has shared substantial intelligence with law 
enforcement partners around the world, and this initiative continues to 
dedicate resources with various active investigations throughout the 
country.
    Thank you for your support in this area and for your continued 
assistance in helping us combat this threat.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today, and I'm happy 
to answer any questions you may have on this topic.

    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Mr. Perez.
    Members will now be recognized by seniority for their 5 
minutes of questioning. An additional round of questioning may 
be called after all Members have been recognized.
    I now recognize myself for 5 minutes.
    I appreciate the service and what you all do and especially 
your partnership with the State and the local levels. I think I 
want to start, you know, just by trends and ask each of you 
quickly, are there areas, geographic areas, cities that seem to 
have higher rates of organized retail crime that are being 
impacted?
    I'll start with you, Mr. Krol, and we'll just go down the 
line.
    Mr. Krol. Thank you, sir, for that question.
    You know, we see the poly-criminal transnational 
organizations now no longer tied to a single criminal scheme or 
enterprise. What we do see is, you know, organized retail crime 
groups involved in certain, you know, methods and 
methodologies. I think they are driven by greed and 
opportunity, not so much location and geographic region.
    Mr. Pfluger. OK. Mr. Kane, Mr. Perez, quickly any areas 
that you see that are being impacted disproportionately?
    Mr. Kane. I would say no areas in particular. I agree with 
the HSI SAC that I think they're geographical and they tend to 
take the exploitation where those opportunities can be 
exploited; i.e., for example, gas pump skimming which was a 
huge thing several years back.
    Mr. Pfluger. Yes.
    Mr. Kane. I-95 seemed to be the corridor. There was no 
direct location.
    Mr. Pfluger. Mr. Perez.
    Mr. Perez. Sir, similar comments. Our offices around the 
country, we have 9 Major Theft Task Forces. These were 
developed by individual field offices. They really vary and 
range from Los Angeles, Memphis, Pittsburgh, to West Texas, 
sir, and El Paso where we've established an Organized Crime 
Task Force as well. This is deferred to by our local field 
offices. I can't speak to one area more than another. We see 
various trends as mentioned in one corridor. I've seen a theft 
of fuel in West Texas, sir, in your area that are significant 
that leads us to establish local partnerships to target some of 
these unique threats.
    Mr. Pfluger. What about felony thresholds? Have you seen 
State by State or jurisdiction by jurisdiction or action from 
DAs that have led to increases? So let's say the raising of a 
felony threshold, has that had an effect on the number of 
organized retail crime events that you see?
    Mr. Perez. Sir, I can't speak to that.
    Mr. Pfluger. OK. Any other on the panel?
    Mr. Kane. No, sir.
    Mr. Krol. No, sir.
    Mr. Pfluger. OK. Let's go to the Secret Service. Mr. Kane, 
when does the Secret Service--what does the Secret Service see 
as the largest threat to maintaining a safe environment for 
financial transactions, whether it be credit cards, gift cards, 
U.S. currency? What does--kind-of talk me through that.
    Mr. Kane. I think, obviously, with the holidays hitting, 
it's high volume, and places like convenience stores and gas 
stations seem to be the best because they can get a lot of 
numbers very quickly.
    The second kind-of on the edge of new things are what they 
call quishing, which is like the scanning of QR codes which are 
not actual QR codes. They actually will take you to a site and 
ask you to apply information, personal information. That's a 
new one.
    Then gift card fraud, which is happening a little bit more 
prevalently where people are taking gift cards, reencoding them 
in the back, activating them very quickly with limitless 
amounts of money, but then when you go and actually buy the 
gift card, you're loading the dollar up. So combating that is a 
little tough. It's a little bit more heavy on the retailers. At 
the local level, the convenience store levels, it's just really 
on the locals. Again, the person using these ATM/sliders, they 
need to make sure that those devices are legitimate as best 
they can. We always say give it a tug. It might come apart. You 
never know.
    Mr. Pfluger. Mr. Krol, we're talking about Operation 
Boiling Point focused on combatting this organized retail crime 
trend. How much organized retail crime investigations has HSI's 
Boston Field Office conducted? Can you find any red tape or 
roadblocks that have stood in the way between effective 
partnerships with the State and local level?
    Mr. Krol. Thank you for that question.
    We do have active investigations on-going now, don't have a 
historical number, but certainly those that are international 
in scope and ones that involve our Federal, State, and local 
partners spread throughout New England.
    What I will say I don't see any red tape. What I see is 
just the necessity to prioritize the myriad of crimes that we 
see as Federal agents. You know, we see kind-of three tiers of 
retail crime. No. 1, you're a single scope who may, you know, 
steal out of necessity; No. 2, your more coordinated groups who 
might not reach in interstate commerce; and then, No. 3, which 
is where I think Federal agents should be, is the more 
sophisticated networks, those that are involved in cyber-
enabled crime and maybe, you know, some more sophisticated 
methodologies. But we do see the gap between No. 1 and No. 2 
with our State, local, and private-sector partners, which serve 
to your point as why we established----
    Mr. Pfluger. Are these events deterring or scaring the 
public? Is it something that's scaring the public and deterring 
businesses from having open stores in different places?
    Mr. Krol. Sir, what I can say is, you know, obviously the 
awareness of the crime has been certainly something that we've 
seen much more of, whether in the media or within law 
enforcement. I think the awareness of the crime is something 
that's going to help us to attack those networks and make sure 
that we have an impact.
    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you. My time has expired.
    I now recognize the Ranking Member for your questions.
    Mr. Magaziner. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you all again for 
your public service and for coming here today.
    I think one of the things that we are challenged with as we 
have this conversation on organized retail crime is 
difficulties with the data. You know, to Chairman Pfluger's 
question about are there certain areas where this is more 
prevalent to questions about is this becoming more prevalent 
over time, which we're hearing from the retailers it is, and we 
believe them, but the data is spotty.
    So I guess I want to just ask each of you are you able to 
get as agencies the data that you need from local law 
enforcement, from retailers to help you anticipate the trends? 
If not, are there things that we can be doing at the policy 
level to help fill in those data gaps so that we can better 
wrap our hands around the situation and how to deal with it?
    So I'll open it up to any of you.
    Mr. Krol. Thank you for that question.
    Certainly to that point is why HSI established Operation 
Boiling Point 2.0, you know, for pillars to establish and 
enhance private-sector partnerships. You know, No. 2, we have 
dissemination but also acquisition of information that's going 
to help us disrupt those organized crime--organized retail 
crime networks. And then, last, make sure that we're, you know, 
enhancing our public awareness campaign.
    I think to that point is understanding the data is 
understanding the threat. For us in law enforcement, I think I 
speak on behalf of Secret Service and FBI when I say the more 
information we have, the better-prepared we are to address not 
only existing threats but emerging threats that maybe we don't 
see to that point. You know, certainly cyber-enabled crime is 
something that we're significantly concerned about and I figure 
network intrusions and new data breaches and that information 
that may be not be public is certainly a concern to law 
enforcement. I think we could be of benefit to our private-
sector partners to help them resolve and mitigate those 
threats.
    Mr. Magaziner. Thank you.
    Mr. Kane. Sir, one of the things, we obviously with the R&C 
fraud facility will train 5,000 people or law enforcement 
agencies this year throughout all your districts. Those would 
now become the barometers for kind-of fraud and kind-of what's 
happening in those sectors. That becomes my data resource 
because my CFTFs are telling me very robustly this is kind-of 
occurring in our district. Here's where we should apply some 
resources.
    One area, you know, we've obviously talked about for us is 
countering the Money Laundering Act of 2023, which is something 
we suggested, which kind-of helps us, obviously, go after 
unlicensed money laundering, because we believe if you can hit 
the pocketbooks of bad actors, then they will, obviously, find 
a new crime to participate in. That's the two things.
    Mr. Perez. Thank you, sir.
    I would echo similar to what my colleagues have said as far 
as collaboration and communication. The FBI nationally, we've 
tried to improve some framework to collect that information 
from law enforcement, through our Criminal Justice Information 
Service, and through our NIBRS program to collect that data 
from law enforcement. But that is only as good as what's being 
put into our databases, if you will. So we try to expand that 
and augment that through our collaborations individually with 
our field offices. The task force concept for us is tried and 
true for all of Federal law enforcement where we sit in a 
colocated environment with our State and local partners. At 
times we'll embed with them in fusion centers or in police 
departments around the country to really be on the front lines 
to receive that data and better leverage that information.
    Additionally, in the outreach piece, as I mentioned, we 
have elements dedicated toward private-sector engagement, our 
National--our Domestic Security Alliance Council, the DSAC 
program, to really have direct contact and outreach with our 
private-sector partners, to include the retail industry, also 
the specific efforts we do out of our Major Theft Program to 
have discussions, attend these conferences, and really be part 
of that discussion to articulate what the--to receive what that 
need is from the retail companies, to better receive that data 
so we can make decisions.
    Mr. Magaziner. Thank you.
    With the time I have left, just one more question. As we 
mentioned earlier, I mean, we're not talking about individual 
shoplifters here. We're talking about, in many cases, 
sophisticated organizations that are stealing these goods at 
scale for resale. They're doing this to make money by selling 
these goods on the black market or on-line, or what have you.
    So can you talk a little bit about what your agencies are 
doing at that point of resale to try to disrupt what these 
organizations are doing? Because I would think that oftentimes 
it's easier to catch them potentially at the resale point than 
it is at the store level.
    Mr. Krol. Thank you, sir, for that question.
    Might I just add that the INFORM Act will certainly help us 
do that to understand those that are involved in e-commerce 
platforms and third-party sellers and resellers. That is 
certainly something that at our innovation lab and cyber crime 
center and cross-border financial crime center we're working 
very closely on.
    Mr. Kane. I mean, obviously, with those in the computer 
forensics part, we live kind-of in the dark web marketplaces 
for a lot of things. Those are great areas to kind-of, what I 
call, make your case, but then we also have to forensically 
prove it. So that's obviously--those two key elements for us 
are kind-of helping put that point on what you just asked.
    Mr. Perez. Similarly, we focus a lot on the dark net, a lot 
of movement of illicit proceeds, narcotics, weapons, and stolen 
goods on the dark net. We'll look at those cases. Sometimes the 
resale portion, depending if it's in mass, we'll look at it and 
try to identify the organization. If it's more individualized, 
we can use that to begin a case and develop that intelligence 
to determine where that merchandise is coming from. We look for 
ways to identify those networks and disrupt them through those 
patterns. The goal there is to, again, identify, work up the 
chain. So sometimes identifying the money movement as well that 
comes in return from some of the sale of goods really helps us 
identify where these networks are.
    Mr. Magaziner. Thank you.
    I'm over time, so I yield back.
    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, 
Mr. Bishop.
    Mr. Bishop. Are lax local prosecutorial practices 
concerning property crime contributing to the organized retail 
crime that you have described?
    Mr. Perez. Sir, again, I can't speak to that. I can tell 
you that we work aggressively within the Federal scope, the 
statutes that we have, whether it's for interstate 
transportation of stolen goods or things like Hobbs Act, those 
are violations that we'll investigate aggressively. At times we 
can leverage State prosecution as well if for some reason we 
can't charge a case Federal, so we'll work aggressively to 
leverage both.
    Mr. Bishop. Are lax border control policies contributing to 
the development of transnational criminal organization 
conducting organized retail crime?
    Mr. Perez. I can't speak to that either, sir.
    Mr. Bishop. Can either of you other gentlemen, can you 
speak to it?
    Mr. Krol. Sir, what I can say is we're certainly laser-
focused on criminal networks and those criminal networks that 
affect our National border and economic security, whether they 
reside internationally or domestically. I think where--you 
know, between our border enforcement security task forces, our 
transnational investigative units overseas, and our 
international presence, we are laser-focused both on, you know, 
your traditional arrest, indictment, conviction, but also your 
nontraditional, which would be, you know, your cyber intrusion, 
mitigation, you know, obviously and other more complex methods 
to investigate transnational crime.
    Mr. Bishop. Mr. Kane.
    Mr. Kane. I mean, sir, we've obviously had several cases to 
your point, actually a joint case with HSI in California 
regarding EBT fraud, and the groups are, you know, Eastern 
European obviously coming in and kind-of subverting the border 
process. We had problems identifying them. So we do see it, but 
I see it on a very limited scale, not to the scale that I would 
say maybe the bureau and HSI sees it.
    Mr. Bishop. Does the--have there been reductions in local 
police forces? I have the impression that at least during the 
pandemic and following the George Floyd killing and the issues 
relating to that that we saw police forces decline, a lot of--a 
sort-of surge in resignations of police forces locally. Is that 
still the case, or has there been a recovery from that?
    Mr. Kane.
    Mr. Kane. I mean, sir, obviously locally I think we--as far 
as resignations, I don't know. I do think there is a challenge 
in recruitment for local law enforcement. There's a recruitment 
challenge at our level to get people on the books, so to speak. 
I can't say it's attributable to those events, though.
    Mr. Bishop. Mr. Perez.
    Mr. Perez. Same, sir. I'm aware nationally of some decline 
in recruitment, and that's always a challenge similarly for us, 
for all the Federal departments in law enforcement. I can't 
speak to as to the why. I know following COVID that obviously 
had an effect nationally. I can't speak to whether there's an 
upswing or not, sir, currently.
    Mr. Bishop. Mr. Krol.
    Mr. Krol. Thank you, sir.
    We recognize the troubles that our State and local partners 
have in recruiting. I think that's one area where Federal law 
enforcement can certainly lend assistance to our partners where 
they need it. I think some of the more nontraditional methods 
where assisting State and local law enforcement partners, 
whether in violent crime, narcotics trafficking, weapons 
trafficking, other areas, certainly in organized theft groups, 
we can provide those resources to them, you know, through our 
Task Force Officer Program. You know, we have 4,000 task force 
offices domestically. We can help to augment their local police 
departments with, you know, possibly resources, datasets, and 
other information that they might not have available to them.
    Mr. Bishop. I'm familiar that in Ashville, North Carolina, 
for example, there's an enormous loss of police force. Cities 
throughout North Carolina--I'm more familiar with that than 
other cities in the country--there has been a tremendous 
impairment of the size of the police force. They're way down 
from their anticipated numbers.
    It strikes me--and I certainly appreciate the fact that you 
guys are sort-of not really in some cases wanting to attribute 
causes of the problem that we face and you're dealing with it 
as law enforcement, and I respect what you have to do. It does 
seem to me that while we can help treat symptoms by doing more 
information sharing and task force and resource provision, if 
we've caused a lot of the problem by not sufficiently backing 
law enforcement--and a lot of policy makers have given 
inadequate support for law enforcement--if we have prosecutors 
who've decided not to prosecute property crimes, if we have a 
border that is uncontrolled and it gives rise to transnational 
criminal organizations-led bands that go across the country and 
do this kind of crime, we're probably not going to solve the 
problem until we address those problems.
    So that is just my observation, but I certainly appreciate 
the efforts that you bring to the case every single day and all 
those men and women that work under you in your agencies.
    Thank you.
    Mr. Pfluger. The gentleman's time has expired.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. 
Correa.
    Mr. Correa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I want to follow up on Mr. Bishop's comments. Data 
information--and if I can ask the three of you--how much of 
this is organized crime versus retail crime that is 
shoplifting? Do you have any guesstimates here?
    Mr. Krol. Sir, thank you.
    The data that we have is certainly something that we need 
to work better on and to understand it with our private and 
State and local partners. I can't speak to exactly the 
difference between, you know, kind-of a more retail crime 
versus----
    Mr. Correa. I ask you that because I want to make sure 
we're not operating in silos and, if we are, that we try to get 
away from that.
    Mr. Perez mentioned the Chilean gangs. That was an issue 
that popped up in my county, in Orange County, California. My 
local DA brought it up to our attention, and we brought it up 
to the Feds' attention. We changed the visa program, visa 
waiver program, and we hope that helps to begin to solve the 
problem.
    But I can't help but think that sometimes we're chasing our 
own tail, and we're always a little bit too late to the party, 
so to speak. So sharing information almost on a real-time basis 
I think is key to figuring out the patterns, the trends, what 
is emerging. I mean, from the Chile situation, we found out it 
was the Romanians are also involved in this and a lot of 
groups.
    But, you know, looking at the retail versus the shoplifting 
versus the organized crime, you've got crypto. You've got a lot 
of interesting things working here. But we clearly want to 
protect our communities from those losses. We clearly want to 
protect the retailers as well. We want to figure out big 
picture as to how to go about coming up with good solutions.
    Like Mr. Bishop said, a lot of our law enforcement numbers 
are down, and that's a big issue. We've got to figure out some 
solutions here.
    But, you know, smash-and-grab, organized crime, retail 
theft, it's hard to figure out which is which. But if you don't 
know which is which, then it's even harder to come up with a 
good solution. I look forward to working with all of you in 
trying to figure this out, get some real data so that based on 
that data folks up here can come up with good public policy 
with the administration and come up with real solutions in real 
time.
    Let me ask you another question, which is we talk about 
cooperation, Federal, State, local. What about international? 
Do you feel like you're getting the type of cooperation that 
you need from international players out there that might be 
part of the solution here?
    Mr. Krol.
    Mr. Krol. Thank you, sir, and appreciate that comment.
    Certainly our investigative presence overseas is the 
largest that DHS has, and working through our host country 
transnational criminal investigative units, very important to 
receiving information. As you know, sir, our authorities as 
special agents in the international footprint differs than that 
in the United States. So we certainly rely on their knowledge, 
their investigators, their prosecutors, and others to make sure 
that we're receiving the appropriate information and we're able 
to act on that.
    Mr. Correa. Mr. Kane.
    Mr. Kane. Sir, I believe the information, international 
connections right now that we have are better than they've been 
in my 22 years.
    Mr. Correa. So they're getting better?
    Mr. Kane. They're getting better. I believe that because 
now information just flows so much easier between our 
countries, and then, too, the informal agreements of, like, 
what we can provide and what they can provide us is back. So 
certain countries, as you know, will never work with us, but 
many along the way have been very good to us and especially 
very good to our investigations, yes, sir.
    Mr. Correa. Mr. Perez.
    Mr. Perez. Sir, overall I'd say relations are good, maybe 
in a better situation as well. I know we position agents 
strategically. We have in our legal attache offices well over, 
I believe, 60 around the world. More specific to this threat, 
and we've talked about the South American theft groups, sir, 
we've pre-positioned--in addition to our legal attaches, we 
supplemented that office in Santiago, Chile, to add additional 
bodies. We have legal attaches in Mexico. We've also 
supplemented that with what we've referred to as our border 
liaison officers. These are FBI agents that sit on this side of 
the border and are cross-designated to operate in Mexico to 
collect information and communicate more directly with our 
counterparts.
    Mr. Correa. I'm glad to hear you say that because it's not 
your problem. It's not their problem. It's our problem. A 
victim, whether it's a family that gets a family member 
kidnapped in Mexico or held for ransom in Mexico usually 
affects a family here in the United States as well. Again, it's 
not your problem. It's our problem.
    In the last 2 seconds I have, I'd say offer to work with 
us--any legislative solutions, any diplomatic solutions. Let us 
know. We're here to help.
    Mr. Perez. Thank you.
    Mr. Correa. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm out of time, and I 
yield.
    Mr. Pfluger. The gentleman yields.
    The Chair now recognize the gentlemen from New York, Mr. 
D'Esposito, for your questioning.
    Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Good afternoon. Thank you all for your service and for 
being here.
    It seems that one of the primary hurdles to successful 
prosecution of organized criminal groups repeatedly targeting 
retail businesses is the difficulty to tie an individual or 
group to multiple incidents across several jurisdictions, such 
as patterns, rather than looking at each incident individually, 
which fails to recognize the toll the group may have and may be 
taking on a particular retailer.
    I want to thank the Chairman for his work in this 
committee. One of the things that we've been focusing on in the 
committee that I chair, the Subcommittee of Emergency 
Management and Technology, is communication and cooperation 
between different agencies.
    I spent a career in the NYPD, and I think that as law 
enforcement professionals, we could probably say that one of 
the greatest tools in our tool belt is communication with other 
agencies.
    So I think what's important for those that are listening 
back home and for those here, what resources are available from 
agencies like yours that could specifically help local and 
State agencies so that we can do a better job?
    Mr. Perez. Sir, again, I go back to highlighting our task 
force initiatives around the country, so developing things like 
our Safe Streets, Organized Crime Task Forces that have unique 
threats, unique responsibilities, establishing our Major Theft 
Task Forces. Then separately the OCDETF program for the 
department, for the FBI, for other elements of the department 
is really our core model for collaboration, communication, 
deconfliction both at the Federal and State level. So we're 
working with our partners in OCDETF to actually develop a 
strategic initiative to help target organized retail theft to 
better allow resources and funding and communication efforts at 
the Federal and State level throughout the country.
    Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you.
    Mr. Kane. Thank you.
    I'll echo IOC-2, which is a center that we--obviously, all 
of the Federal agents here at the table deconflict in, that's a 
great resource for Federal level. State level has some other 
challenges because they don't all talk to each other. However, 
a lot of them participate. NYPD does an accurate database which 
kind-of allows all State agencies to talk, but our Cyber Fraud 
Task Force, you know, similar to these other task forces, 
again, that's how we kind-of inject tools, resources. Again, 
that's funded by you. It goes directly back out to the offices. 
That's how we do it, and it's been highly successful.
    I was telling the gentlemen here today, 80 percent of some 
of the forensic work I do is not even for my agency. It's for 
State and local agencies.
    Mr. Krol. Sir, thank you.
    Having worked in New York City, I know NYPD's finest very 
well, and thank you for your service.
    Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you.
    Mr. Krol. You know, I could certainly speak to our Centers 
of Excellence, Cross-Border Financial Crime, our Cybercrime 
Center, our National Intellectual Property Rights and 
Coordination Center, and many, many others, Innovation Lab. You 
know, certainly they're all great centers that provide great 
resources and information to Federal agencies, and I think what 
we're doing--and we need to do a better job--is making sure 
that we're reaching into our private-sector and State and local 
partners to ensure that they understand the resources available 
to them. I think the National Intellectual Property Rights 
Center that we lead is certainly a great example of the 
private-sector and public partnerships that we need to use to 
enhance our investigations. You know, I think until we have 
those--you know, kind-of that holistic view and whole-of-
Government and private-sector view on crime, it will be tough 
for us to attack this threat.
    Mr. D'Esposito. So, Mr. Krol, to your point, I think that 
very often we see that the resources that you guys provide, 
which are amazing, are very often, I guess, from the top down. 
I guess my question is how can we do a better job making sure 
exactly what you mentioned? These smaller law enforcement 
agencies--I mean, you go back to my district where I represent 
many villages. Some of those villages have their own police 
departments and deal with retail crime every single day. They 
may not be afforded the same opportunities like the big ones, 
like the NYPD and other big law enforcement agencies.
    So not only, I guess, what can we do as Members of Congress 
to make sure that our law enforcement professionals know 
exactly the resources that you provide?
    I guess the secondary part of that question is how can we 
on both sides of the aisle work with you guys to make sure 
that, No. 1, those resources are there and, No. 2, that those 
smaller agencies, even the ones that are tucked in those small 
towns who, unfortunately, are battling these issues right on 
their main streets, how can we make sure that they have the 
information they need to take advantage of the great work that 
you guys are doing?
    Mr. Pfluger. I would ask briefly as the time has expired.
    Mr. D'Esposito. Yes. I'm sorry, Chairman.
    Mr. Krol. I would just say we need to be nontraditional on 
our approach, and that is possibly, you know, inserting our 
special agents and their subject-matter expertise into local 
police departments, much like we have our Task Force Officer 
Program, 4,000 State and local task force officers. It is 
educate the educator, you know, really, train the trainer. Let 
them be the best resource for their local police department to 
come to HSI or Secret Service or FBI or ATF, or wherever it may 
be. You know, certainly we'd do that. In Rhode Island, we do 
it, in Bennington, Vermont, in Rutland, Vermont, and other 
areas. So I think it's a national mall that we all use.
    Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you guys very much. I would love to 
follow up with you guys with a conversation after this.
    Mr. Chairman, I know my time has expired. I yield back.
    Mr. Pfluger. The gentleman's time has expired.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Nevada, Ms. 
Titus.
    Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I mentioned earlier that I had witnessed some of this 
organized crime, and it was in a Walgreens. A person came up 
with a backpack and just started scraping eyelashes into the 
backpack. Now, eyelashes aren't power tools, I'll give you 
that. But look around, there's certainly a market for it. They 
don't sell it directly. They sell it to somebody at a swap meet 
who sells it or they sell the drill to somebody who sells it on 
the internet. So it really is a network.
    I went up to the clerk and I said, Did you see what that 
guy just did? She said, Yes. He comes in here about once a 
week, but the companies have told us not to do anything about 
it because we might get hurt or the customers might get hurt.
    All of us have been in stores where you now see everything 
is locked down, and you have to call the clerk to come over and 
help you retrieve something. You can't just pull it off the 
shelf. So it's dangerous. It's inconvenient, and it's costing 
tax money as well as business profit.
    I hear these questions of what can we do to help you do 
your job better, and I would ask you, Mr. Krol, to talk more 
about Operation Boiling Point. It seems to me it's kind-of like 
fusion centers that we have in communities where all different 
kinds of law enforcement and first responders and the private 
sector--in my district, Las Vegas, nobody has a better eye in 
the sky than gaming does to try and address this.
    In my bill, H.R. 895, it's a provision to house a center to 
combat organized retail crime within HSI. I wonder if you might 
comment on how that would help us to bring information 
together, be a one-stop shop or complement what you're doing.
    Mr. Krol. Thank you very much for your long-standing 
efforts in this space.
    Understanding I can't speak to, you know, legislation that 
is still on-going and hasn't been signed into law, what I can 
say is that we have seen a similar model used many, many times 
before, and that model is not new. Multi-agency command 
centers, multi-agency deconfliction centers that involve the 
private and public sector and law enforcement partners are 
certainly the best case and best model for us to continue. 
Operation Boiling Point 2.0 is really recognition of this 
threat but also trying to take a little bit more proactive 
stance to identify, you know, what partners we need to be in 
contact with, how do we share information with them better, but 
how do we gain information from possibly private sector that we 
don't already have and then use that information more 
effectively to target these retail crime and organized theft 
groups.
    Last, I think, you know, we talk about public awareness, 
but really this is buyer beware. You know, the consumer needs 
to be the best proponent of their money and where they're 
buying products from. They're really the first line of defense 
next to our State and local partners.
    So I would say, you know, certainly anything we can do to 
support the consumer and industry and ensure economic security, 
I think that's an important piece of Operation Boiling Point 
2.0.
    Ms. Titus. I think the inconvenience and perhaps the danger 
of going into a neighborhood where you have a store that's been 
attacked a number of times, driving people to shop on the 
internet more and more, and, that of course, raises other kind 
of problems.
    But we heard that these organized groups use the money for 
drug trade but also for human trafficking.
    Can you talk about that, Mr. Kane? Are you familiar with 
any--or anybody talk about that as a connection to this?
    Mr. Kane. Ma'am, most of the crimes that were under our 
purview usually don't lend itself to human trafficking. That's 
probably more in one of my colleague's----
    Ms. Titus. OK. Either one.
    Mr. Perez. Ma'am, we do have a human trafficking program. I 
can't speak to any connection specifically to organized retail 
theft.
    As I mentioned earlier, criminal organizations for us are 
diverse. So they're always going to look for an opportunity to 
make money, whether that's retail theft, trafficking in 
persons, drugs, guns, whatever allows them the ability to make 
money.
    I haven't seen a direct correlation between the two, but 
really that speaks to the need for what we've been talking 
about collectively which is continued collaboration, 
collection, sharing of intelligence, and collaboration amongst 
all law enforcement partners.
    Ms. Titus. I yield back.
    Mr. Pfluger. The gentlelady yields.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. 
Crane.
    Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it.
    I want to say thank you to the gentlemen on the panel for 
your careers in law enforcement.
    I did notice, though, when Chairman Pfluger asked if any of 
you saw any trends in the explosion of organized retail crime, 
none of you responded with any trends that you guys were 
noticing. That struck me as interesting because I know that you 
guys are all really smart or you wouldn't be here.
    Isn't part of being an effective member of law enforcement 
having the ability to spot trends and pattern recognition?
    Mr. Krol.
    Mr. Krol. Yes, I certainly appreciate your concern and 
recognize your question.
    Of course, we focus on emerging threats and existing 
threats, and truly to respond to those is something that we do 
every day. I think the cyber-enabled crime up front is one 
we're certainly dealing with right now. Network intrusion and 
data breaches and, you know, especially items, identity, 
licenses, financial information sold on the dark web is 
something that concerns most of us. I would say that would 
certainly be a trend that we would look to.
    Mr. Crane. OK. Thank you.
    Do you think having maybe a billionaire like George Soros 
spending $40 million of his own money, supporting leftist 
prosecutors and DAs who are soft on crime might have something 
to do with it? Is that a trend that might have something to do 
with the insanity that we see in American cities right now?
    Mr. Krol. Thanks for your question, sir.
    I'd respectfully withhold comment on that one.
    Mr. Crane. Smart.
    Mr. Kane.
    Mr. Kane. Soros wouldn't have the context to be able to 
provide an intelligible answer that would----
    Mr. Crane. OK. Mr. Perez, do you think that might be a 
trend that has something to do with the lawlessness that we see 
going on in American cities right now?
    Mr. Perez. Sir, I can't comment on that.
    Mr. Crane. OK. How about lowering the felony thresholds, as 
Mr. Pfluger brought up? Do you think that has anything to do 
with it? Same answer?
    I respect the fact that you gentlemen are--got to be 
careful. I get it. But you think that might be a trend that has 
something to do with the out-of-control retail crime that we 
see going on across the United States?
    Mr. Perez. Sir, I can't comment on that. As I mentioned 
earlier, the Federal statutes that allow us to investigate 
these crimes are ample and we investigate them aggressively.
    Mr. Crane. OK. Well, to be honest, though, Mr. Perez, the 
Federal statutes really have nothing to do with whether or not 
you're able to spot some of these trends that everybody in the 
country knows and understands. Everybody knows what's going on. 
It's so obvious.
    Let me give you guys a little research that I just did up 
here right now. This is from Forbes. Target blames organized 
crime for closing 9 stores across the United States. Guess what 
cities they were in? New York, Seattle, Portland, San 
Francisco, Oakland.
    Any trends there? We all know.
    Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Pfluger. Will the gentleman yield?
    Mr. Crane. Yes.
    Mr. Pfluger. Mr. Perez, picking up on this line of 
questioning, does the inclusion of a consequence of a penalty, 
of a prison sentence, of a fine, deter criminal activity?
    Mr. Perez. Sir, that's an opinion. I don't know that I 
could speak to that.
    Mr. Pfluger. You're with the FBI.
    Mr. Perez. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Pfluger. If there's a severe penalty, does that prevent 
crime from happening?
    Mr. Perez. I don't know if it prevents crime from 
happening. I can tell you that at times we'll leverage what 
would be stiffer sentences in the Federal system to garner 
maybe better cases or some type of cooperation----
    Mr. Pfluger. Yes.
    Mr. Perez [continuing]. That leads us to really get--garner 
better intelligence.
    Mr. Pfluger. Mr. Kane, do penalties have an impact on 
deterrence of criminal activity?
    Mr. Kane. I think it has a deterrent on cooperation or 
pursuing further cases, absolutely.
    Mr. Pfluger. OK. I think the point of this is trying to 
pinpoint why organized retail crime is happening. It's 
affecting the safety of our communities. When I read the Day 
One memo from District Attorney Bragg that says he's directing 
his assistant district attorneys not to prosecute several 
crimes including trespassing, resisting arrest, engaging in 
prostitution, and other things, and that armed robbery should 
not be prosecuted as felonies, does that have an impact on 
organized retail crime in New York City?
    Mr. Krol.
    Mr. Krol. Sir, thank you for that question.
    You know, what I would say is I would echo their comments 
is that, you know, certainly greed has a huge factor. I would 
say that the length of potential, you know, jail time certainly 
has an impact on a criminal's mens rea, if you will. But 
outside of that, I can't really speak to the--what a prosecutor 
would prefer to see.
    Mr. Pfluger. OK. The gentleman's time has expired.
    He yields back.
    I'd like to thank the witnesses for your valuable 
testimony. At this point in time, seeing no other Members to 
question, the first panel is dismissed. Thank you for your time 
today.
    I now invite the second panel to take their seats.
    As a administrative note, we know there are votes that are 
coming up. So we're going continue to roll straight into this. 
We'll give you a second to switch out and take your notes. OK.
    I'm pleased to have a second distinguished panel of 
witnesses before us today on a very--this very important topic.
    I ask that our witnesses please rise and raise your right 
hand.
    Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give 
before the Committee on Homeland Security of the U.S. House of 
Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
but the truth, so help you God?
    Thank you. You may be seated.
    Let the record reflect that the witnesses have answered in 
the affirmative.
    I would now like to formally introduce our second panel.

statement of 5 minutes.

      STATEMENT OF DAVID JOHNSTON, VICE PRESIDENT,  ASSET
        PROTECTION AND RETAIL OPERATIONS, NATIONAL RETAIL
        FEDERATION

    Mr. Johnston. Thank you, Chairman Pfluger, Ranking Member 
Magaziner, and distinguished Members of the committee for 
inviting me to testify on behalf of the National Retail 
Federation and the retail industry on the issue of organized 
retail crime.
    We've submitted a longer statement for the record, and my 
testimony will summarize that submission.
    NRF is the world's largest retail trade association, 
representing Main Street retailers and National chain brands. 
As an industry, retail contributes $3.9 trillion to annual GDP 
and supports 1 in 4 U.S. jobs. That's 52 million working 
Americans.
    Before joining the NRF, I spent 36 years as an asset 
protection professional. From apprehending shoplifters from a 
major city department store to holding various roles with a 
national retailer, my previous position was leading the 
corporate security and asset protection teams for a multi-brand 
global restaurant organization. I have witnessed first-hand the 
evolution and progression of theft across the retail industry.
    Shoplifting and organized retail crime is not new. However, 
the landscape of today is unprecedented and unmatched. The 
frequency of theft, the openness and brazenness of the 
criminals, the violence, and the quantities and type of 
merchandise stolen are truthful indicators of criminal activity 
beyond amateur or opportunistic shoplifting for need. These are 
markers toward the proliferation and evolution of organized 
retail crime.
    ORC networks orchestrate, influence, and create demand for 
those committing theft and fraud in our retail environments. 
Shoplifting, cargo theft, burglaries, smash-and-grabs, and 
various frauds are just a means to their end.
    Varying in scope and scale, these networks range from 
loosely-organized, local and regional groups to highly-
sophisticated hierarchies operating at a transnational level.
    These criminal groups thrive on enabling others to commit 
their crimes. They prey on the homeless, the addicted, and even 
the victims of human trafficking. They profit from the 
reselling of stolen goods on-line, rechannelling and 
redistributing goods back into our marketplace and the 
transportation of stolen goods and proceeds beyond our border.
    We believe that these groups use organized retail crime as 
a gateway crime with profits funding more nefarious activities 
including drugs, weapons, and human trafficking. These groups 
must be the focus of our local, State, and Federal efforts.
    The impact of organized retail crime and its underlying 
crimes extends far beyond retailers' profitability. Retailers 
continue to spend billions of dollars to protect their goods, 
their workers, and consumers including measures that have 
impacted the shopping experience.
    Customers have experienced shortened store hours or 
restricted product availability. Small businesses and national 
brands have closed locations, creating community tax revenue 
loss and the inability of its residents to easily obtain goods.
    Despite what some people say, ORC is not a victimless 
crime. Violence continues to escalate as several retailers have 
already recorded upwards of more than a hundred percent 
increase in assaults in violent acts over the past year alone. 
Employee injuries and deaths have occurred as recently as last 
week in the city of Philadelphia.
    Retailers have increased violence prevention training, 
mental health support, and security presence to keep their 
employees safe. The fear of violence in some communities have 
impacted employee retention and hampered labor efforts in an 
already tight labor market.
    Criminals involved with ORC continue to take advantage of 
jurisdictions with higher felony thresholds, lesser penalties 
for theft, and communities lacking law enforcement resources. 
Even when law enforcement engages, coordination and 
investigation across jurisdictions are often a challenge.
    As a far-too-common example, one of our members is 
currently dealing with a group of 70 individuals traveling to 
more than 190 of their locations, committing over 350 incidents 
of shoplifting and fraud. Although some were apprehending, the 
majority remain at large due to investigative challenges with 
various law enforcement and differing prosecutorial 
requirements across multiple States.
    The Combatting Organized Retail Crime Act will support 
retailers against such criminal organizations. The creation of 
a Federal interagency center within Homeland Security 
Investigations will bring together information sharing and 
investigative support to Federal, State, and local and Tribal 
agencies. Changes to the U.S. criminal code provide increased 
enforcement tools to help reduce cross-jurisdictional crimes.
    With Federal coordination, collaboration, support, and 
resources, we can bring the fight to these organized groups 
across our Nation.
    As I close, please consider three key points. First, 
without a doubt, the issue of organized retail crime has a 
serious impact on retail and will continue to worsen without 
appropriate action.
    Second, this is not a retail-only issue to solve. It 
requires all-of-Government, whole-community approach.
    Finally, Congress took an important step in passing the 
Informed Consumers Act last year.
    On behalf of the retail industry, I urge and encourage you 
to take the next step forward with the passage of Combatting 
Organized Retail Crime Act.
    Thank you for your time and consideration.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Johnston follows:]
    
                  Prepared Statement of David Johnston
                  
                           December 12, 2023
                           
    The National Retail Federation (NRF) respectfully submits this 
statement for the record for the December 12 hearing entitled ``From 
Festive Cheer to Retail Fear: Addressing Organized Retail Crime.'' 
Thank you, Chairman Pfluger and Ranking Member Magaziner, for holding 
this hearing to examine the issue of organized retail crime.
    Organized retail crime (ORC) undermines the very fabric of American 
communities. Through NRF surveys, retailers have reported increases in 
incidents of organized retail crime and more concerningly the level of 
violence tied to these crimes, starting before the pandemic and 
continuing through today. Preventing these crimes in order to protect 
the safety of our workers and our customers is retail's No. 1 priority. 
We urge Congress to prioritize legislation that will support and 
enhance the on-going efforts of Federal, State, and local law 
enforcement to blunt the rise in organized retail crime. We applaud 
Representative Titus as an original sponsor and Ranking Member 
Magaziner for his support of the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act 
(H.R. 895).
    NRF passionately advocates for the people, brands, policies, and 
ideas that help retail succeed. From its headquarters in Washington, 
DC, NRF empowers the industry that powers the economy. Retail is the 
Nation's largest private-sector employer, contributing $3.9 trillion to 
annual GDP and supporting 1 in 4 U.S. jobs--52 million working 
Americans. For over a century, NRF has been a voice for every retailer 
and every retail job, educating, inspiring, and communicating the 
powerful impact retail has on local communities and global economies.
    We routinely convene thousands of retail asset protection and loss 
prevention professionals through our Loss Prevention Council, ORC/
Investigators' Network and conferences. This summer, we hosted our 
annual NRF PROTECT conference in Texas, where ORC was a major topic of 
discussion for our retailers and law enforcement partners in 
attendance. We surveyed 232 retail asset protection professionals at 
the conference, and 90 percent indicated that ORC is more of a risk to 
retail businesses now than it was 3 years ago. In addition to guiding 
our data gathering and policy development, these retail professionals 
support one another by sharing best practices. They form Organized 
Retail Crime Associations that build alliances among State and local 
law enforcement and the private sector. Their experiences, feedback, 
surveys, and data inform NRF's testimony here today.
    Despite some recent press articles that look to downplay ORC or 
argue about data, it is abundantly clear from retailers' experience 
with ORC that the criminal activities we witness in stores across the 
Nation and the incidents of violence tied to them are on the rise. We 
continue to believe that ORC is a ``gateway crime'' and investigations 
have shown the profits from these crimes are often linked to far more 
nefarious crimes. Profits derived from retail theft, cargo theft, and 
sophisticated ecommerce fraud are far greater than reported. What we 
have come to understand about ORC is that theft in our stores is merely 
the tip of the iceberg. Unfortunately, many individuals in the 
community see incidents of theft and shoplifting as victimless petty 
crimes, and even some law enforcement and prosecutors dismiss these 
incidents as trivial. ORC is anything but a victimless crime, as we 
continue to see a rise in violence and lost sales tax revenue for the 
communities where these crimes occur. What many of us do not see lies 
further beneath the surface of highly-publicized smash-and-grab 
incidents captured on national and local news.

            background and history of organized retail crime
            
    There are a lot of questions about what exactly organized retail 
crime is. ORC is not the same as shoplifting or limited to the smash-
and-grab activity prevalent today. The term was first identified by 
loss prevention professionals and law enforcement in the 1970's. It is 
more important to understand that retailers are not able to 
specifically identify a criminal activity as ORC at the time of an 
incident. Whether it is shoplifting, burglary, ecommerce fraud, or 
something else, the retailer may be able to identify some elements of 
ORC at the time of the incident that will be further developed based 
upon an investigation.
    NRF defines ORC as theft or fraud activities conducted with the 
intent to convert illegally-obtained merchandise, cargo, cash, or cash 
equivalents into personal financial gain. It also must involve theft or 
fraud of multiple quantities, conducted in concert by two or more 
people. ORC typically involves multiple occurrences and may occur 
across several stores and jurisdictions.
    Organized retail crime frequently involves orchestrated efforts by 
criminal enterprises to steal merchandise from retailers on a large 
scale. These enterprises often employ sophisticated techniques, such as 
organized shoplifting, fraudulent returns, hijacking of cargo 
shipments, and the use of counterfeit or stolen credit cards. The 
stolen goods are then resold through various channels, including on-
line marketplaces, ecommerce and other websites, peer-to-peer 
marketplaces, flea markets, pawn shops, back into the legitimate supply 
chain, and even at legitimate retail establishments.
    Below are recent examples of organized retail criminal group 
activities that I have received from retail loss prevention leaders who 
are members of NRF's LP Council. Because there are on-going 
investigations into these groups, I cannot directly attribute these to 
specific companies and locations, but these examples are illustrative 
of the types of ORC activity that we are seeing today across the 
country.
  <bullet> A group of Eastern European subjects have been seen across 
        the United States boosting large quantities of merchandise, 
        most often beauty products, using skirts specifically designed 
        for theft. These ``boosting skirts'' have bags and pouches sewn 
        into them to hold large quantities of merchandise. They have 
        also been known to steal athletic merchandise and footwear. 
        Over 170 locations have been impacted by a growing total of 
        more than 168 incidents with losses reported above $449,583 to 
        date. Over 70 individuals have been tied to this activity and 
        these groups, with several subjects traveling across State 
        lines to commit their crimes.
  <bullet> A known booster crew of multiple individuals has been under 
        investigation in Utah since 2019. Through multiple 
        surveillances, it was observed that this group was boosting 7 
        days a week with a minimum of approximately $1,000 of 
        merchandise stolen daily. Favoring handbags, the shoplifters 
        would steal other goods from other retailers (11 different 
        retailers).
    Using GPS tracking devices sewn inside a handbag, law enforcement 
        alongside retailers were able to follow stolen product to a 
        fencing location. Further police investigation, including the 
        use of a confidential informant, identified two fencing 
        locations; both had structured CCTV systems and 
        countersurveillance techniques to protect the fencing 
        locations.
    When warrants and searches of the fences commenced, law enforcement 
        were able to arrest 7 individuals, close 2 fencing operations 
        and identify 10 additional retail victims. Estimated impact 
        involving 11 retailers was valued at approximately $1.4 
        million.
  <bullet> For several years we have had a group that travels from the 
        West Coast to the East Coast for a 6-8-week period, stealing 
        ink cartridges up and down the 
        I-95 corridor. Investigations determined that this group 
        operates an on-line ink cartridge store. They fly to Boston 
        every year, renting a vehicle for the purpose of committing 
        these thefts. They travel up and down the East Coast, stopping 
        at several retail stores daily. The stolen product is shipped 
        back to California.
    The group consisted of two females and one male, who have not yet 
        been identified. Several individual complaints were filed 
        across various jurisdictions, however with their movement State 
        to State, coast to coast, it has been challenging to get State 
        or Federal prosecution or collaboration against the event. 
        Approximate known loss via CCTV with 48 incidents was around 
        $80,000. One individual was recorded re-entering Mexico at the 
        border.
  <bullet> A group of males travel between 4 States committing identity 
        theft by opening credit card accounts. These suspects obtain 
        green card information, create a false green card and then 
        utilize the on-line approval process to open false credit 
        cards.
    They then purchase merchandise with the newly-issued credit card, 
        purchasing predominately gold jewelry (65 percent of 
        purchases). If confronted by associates, they may become 
        violent.
  <bullet> To date, our company has lost over $280,000 involving 52 
        transactions. One suspect identified was previously convicted 
        of committing similar credit fraud against another retailer. 
        Law enforcement continues to investigate.
    Shoplifting one or a few items for personal use--often a crime of 
opportunity--is very different from organized retail crime. But there 
is overlap. Retailers identify three different types of shoplifters: 
opportunistic, amateur, and professional. Some individuals may steal to 
support themselves or family members. Other individuals who are 
addicted to drugs often steal merchandise to resell or trade in order 
to feed their habit. Consequently, these same individuals make 
appealing targets for ORC enterprises to recruit as boosters to support 
their criminal enterprises. While these social challenges deserve an 
empathetic solution, we firmly believe legislative policy can be 
tailored to focus on investigations and prosecutions of those leading 
and profiting from organized retail crime, while providing an effective 
deterrent to shoplifting.
    When taken as a percentage of total retail sales in 2022, retail 
shrink accounted for $112.1 billion in losses, up from $93.9 billion in 
2021, according to the 2023 National Retail Security Survey. Retailers 
reported that ORC remains a significant concern due to heightened 
levels of violence. More than two-thirds (67 percent) of respondents 
said they were seeing even more violence and aggression from ORC 
perpetrators compared with a year ago. As retail crime continues to 
evolve in scope and sophistication, so are retailers' prevention 
efforts. Retailers have increased budget, use of third-party security 
personnel, and use of technology and other threat prevention solutions, 
as well as increased employee workplace violence training.
    Everyone sees the videos of brazen thefts at local stores and 
shopping centers, committed by several individuals working in concert. 
But a significant majority of losses from organized retail crime goes 
unnoticed by the public. For example, sophisticated criminals have 
developed techniques to switch UPC bar codes on merchandise, so they 
ring up differently at checkout, commonly called ``ticket switching.'' 
Criminals use stolen or cloned credit cards to obtain merchandise or 
produce fictitious receipts to return products back to retail stores 
for store credit, which may be given in the form of gift cards that can 
then be resold at a discount from the total value of the card (i.e., 
netting the criminal pure profit for what looks like a good deal to the 
unsuspecting consumer).
    In many instances, organized retail crime groups target several 
retail stores in 1 day, moving from State to State, across 
jurisdictional lines, stealing and reselling merchandise. The groups 
will typically have a shopping list and understand the felony threshold 
levels in the jurisdictions where they are committing these crimes. 
These groups steal thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise in each 
instance with the intent to resell it for profit. These profits often 
finance other illicit activities, such as illegal drugs or weapons 
sales, or fund terrorist and human-trafficking networks overseas.\1\ 
The profits from reselling stolen merchandise can also be managed to 
launder and conceal financial gains from other illegal activities. 
Organized retail crime is a gateway to other nefarious criminal 
activities.

    A smash-and-grab theft could just be an opportunistic event by a 
small group of people, or it could be part of a coordinated series of 
thefts. Only through observation and investigation can retailers and 
law enforcement confirm if a specific theft event is a component of 
organized retail crime activities. Without a doubt, organized criminal 
activity involving the frequent theft of retail goods has resulted in 
the formation of a market in our communities where individuals can 
unload and convert stolen merchandise into cash. Over more than a 
decade, many communities have failed to address what was long viewed as 
victimless property crimes, which has now resulted in people feeling 
more comfortable--even entitled--to steal in order to meet their 
personal needs. Societal changes, from the pandemic (face coverings) to 
the way we shop (on-line, mobile ordering and delivery) to how we 
police communities, have created opportunities for enterprising 
criminals. Retailers are doing all they can to protect their 
associates, customers, and assets. We need government at every level to 
take actions that curtail the ability and opportunity for these 
criminal organizations to profit from stolen merchandise, and to send 
the signal that this type of criminal activity will no longer be 
tolerated.
    During an interview with ABC News, Raul Aguilar, deputy assistant 
director for Homeland Security Investigations, stated that organized 
retail crime ``absolutely is a threat.'' Mr. Aguilar also noted, 
``These criminal networks, they may be full-time drug traffickers, but 
they see an opportunity to work with a crew that's already stealing. 
And because it's hundreds of millions of dollars, [the money they make] 
can easily be diverted for other kinds of activities.''\2\

                     orc is not a victimless crime
                     
    Retail theft is not a victimless crime. It impacts jobs, consumers, 
and communities in several ways. Increased violence involving theft has 
caused injury to employees and consumers, the unfortunate death of some 
retail associates, and a fear of working or shopping in high-crime 
locations. This makes it difficult for retailers to retain or find 
labor to support consumers.
    Each item stolen and resold represents lost sales tax revenue to 
support communities and States, where retailers generate the most tax 
revenue for local governments and the second-most for the State. Lost 
tax revenue impacts a community's ability to fund services including 
law enforcement, health care, or parks and roads.
    Retail is a very narrow net-profit-margin industry. Increased 
losses due to theft and additional expenditures to protect goods reduce 
a retailer's ability to maintain a profitable business, as retailers DO 
NOT have insurance for retail theft. Even if such insurance existed, it 
would be unaffordable. The resulting actions may lead to increased 
prices, fewer jobs or opportunities to provide more pay and benefits, 
or a store closure. Closing stores impacts consumers who lose 
convenient access to goods and communities that lose income and 
property taxes.
    As noted, retailers' foremost concern with ORC activity is the 
safety of retail workers and their customers. Individuals and groups 
committing these crimes have used threats and acts of violence, 
including the use of weapons like bear mace, to aid theft. Some have 
set fires in stores to create a distraction. Extremely concerning is 
the depressing fact that several retail workers have been killed during 
recent theft incidents--including trained security personnel as well as 
retail workers serving in customer-facing roles.\3\ Just last week 
there was an incident in Philadelphia where a retail security guard was 
stabbed and killed while protecting the store and its employees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ http://d-ddaily.com/archivesdaily/2022-Q4-Fatalies-Report.htm.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As more acts of blatant and deadly thefts take place in stores, the 
consequences are apparent for retailers and consumers alike. Both store 
associates and customers are being harmed and threatened. Shoppers are 
now seeing everyday items like toothpaste and dish soap behind lock and 
key. Retailers know it is an inconvenience for customers. The anti-
theft security measures can lead to lost sales from customers who must 
wait for an employee to unlock a cabinet so they can access a product. 
As the theft of merchandise continues, the cost of securing those items 
skyrockets. Retailers already operate on very slim margins and can only 
absorb so much cost to remain profitable. Retailers are boosting their 
budgets for loss prevention and technology, with more than half of 
retailers reporting they are increasing budgets toward personnel, 
technology solutions, and equipment to combat ORC. With ORC incidents 
surging across the country, these additional security investments are 
passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices, fewer choices, 
and less convenience.
    Of great concern to consumers is that this type of criminal 
activity can put their health and safety at risk. For example, 
consumers are at risk when stolen consumable products, such as over-
the-counter medications and infant formula, are put up for resale. 
Pilfered products may not be kept under ideal or required storage 
conditions, which threatens product integrity. And these organized 
criminal enterprises will re-package and re-label stolen products to 
falsely extend the product's expiration date or disguise the fact that 
the merchandise has been stolen. There have been numerous cases 
involving the theft of infant formula that was found not to have been 
properly stored.
    Retailers generate millions of good-paying jobs that are the 
foundation for successful careers, but NRF members report that 
incidents of violence and intimidation that accompany shoplifting have 
increased to a point where retail workers are indicating unease with 
reporting for work. There are currently 543,000 job openings in retail 
and a clear shortage of workers.\4\ Stores that experience frequent, 
visible ORC incidents, particularly those that involve threats or 
assault against retail workers, may experience reduced morale and 
higher staff turnover. Younger workers and their parents are citing the 
ORC they see on the news as a primary concern about the relative safety 
of jobs in retail stores or shopping centers. According to extensive 
polling conducted by Lotis Blue Consulting, retail associates' feeling 
that their health and safety are valued is a significant driver of 
decisions (No. 3 out of 30) to stay with their employer. All else being 
equal, employees were 67 percent more likely to stay with their 
employer if they felt their health and safety were valued, which is an 
increase of 10 percent from 57 percent in 2022. The point is the 
dramatic increase in this figure coincides with the wave of crime in 
retail establishments.

    Americans are increasingly concerned with the harm that organized 
retail crime is causing in their communities. In May 2023, NRF released 
the results of a survey \5\ of over 5,000 U.S. consumers focused on the 
issue of retail crime. It found that 55 percent of consumers believe 
retail crimes such as shoplifting and looting of stores have increased 
in their community since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. The survey 
also found that 64 percent of consumers are concerned about gang-led 
shoplifting, and this increases to 75 percent among consumers who live 
in urban communities. Three-quarters (75 percent) have personally 
shopped in stores where products are kept in locked cabinets to prevent 
theft. Finally, more than half (51 percent) say that law enforcement 
and the courts are too lenient on those who steal from stores.

                     quantifying the impact of orc
                     
    Unfortunately, comprehensive crime data on ORC at the national 
level does not exist and many law enforcement agencies do not 
specifically track ORC as a separate category of crime. Statistics for 
certain crimes that overlap with ORC activity, such as shoplifting, 
larceny, theft, robbery, and commercial burglary, have seen increases 
in major urban areas of the country. Congress should consider ways to 
require specificity and detail with respect to multiple categories of 
property crime, including the reporting of organized retail crime, as 
part of the Uniform Crime Reporting system.
    For 30 years, NRF has surveyed retailers on loss prevention, 
organized retail crime, shoplifting, and other security risks annually 
to publish its National Retail Security Survey (NRSS). This survey of 
retail loss prevention and security executives about risks, threats, 
and vulnerability aims to serve as a benchmark for the retail industry 
and to inform the public about the impact of ORC on the industry. In 
April 2023, NRF released a new report, developed in partnership with 
the company K2 Integrity, entitled ``Organized Retail Crime: An 
Assessment of a Persistent and Growing Threat.'' The report provides a 
detailed assessment of U.S.-based ORC enterprises, their tactics and 
techniques for theft and resale together with linkages to other types 
of organized criminal activity.
    The NRSS and K2 Integrity reports found that ORC groups rely on 
advance planning to ensure the success of their theft operations. This 
includes studying store layouts, camera locations, and exit locations. 
It includes knowing the specific store policies for stopping or 
interfering with suspected thieves. Specifically, the K2 Integrity 
report discovered and identified:
  <bullet> ORC groups largely target everyday consumer goods--which 
        offer a favorable balance between ease of theft, monetary 
        value, and ease of resale--based on analysis of 116 ORC groups 
        that found 81 percent of these groups exclusively stole general 
        consumer goods.
  <bullet> Analysis of 132 ORC groups that conducted booster operations 
        between 2014 and 2022 found that 16 percent used at least one 
        violent tactic--defined as smash-and-grab, use of firearms or 
        other weapons, battery, flash mob tactics, or threats of 
        violence against store employees or customers. Fifteen of the 
        21 violent ORC groups analyzed for the study began operations 
        in 2021, which suggests the uptick in the use of violent 
        tactics during theft operations is a recent development.
  <bullet> ORC groups rely on advance planning to help ensure the 
        success of booster operations. ORC groups that target physical 
        stores build intimate knowledge of store layouts, and some ORC 
        groups exploit the largely similar layouts of National chain 
        stores to develop replicable booster operations across multiple 
        store locations. In some cases, ORC groups plan operations that 
        cover a large area and employ booster crews to travel long 
        distances to conduct thefts. The median retail value of 
        merchandise a booster steals prior to arrest is about $5,000.
  <bullet> The median ORC fencing operation handles about $250,000 in 
        stolen merchandise prior to disruption by law enforcement 
        authorities. ORC fencing operations rely on on-line 
        marketplaces as a resale channel. About 45 percent of ORC 
        groups for which fencing information was available used on-line 
        marketplaces for resale operations. The actual proportion is 
        likely higher given that on-line ORC fencing operations are 
        more difficult for authorities to detect compared with physical 
        resale channels. ORC fences that conduct on-line resale 
        operations appear to be shifting their activities away from 
        third-party on-line sellers and toward peer-to-peer venues that 
        rely on direct engagement among buyers and sellers to complete 
        transactions.
  <bullet> ORC groups will be likely to expand the scale of their 
        operations in response to sustained inflation or an economic 
        slowdown that causes an uptick in underemployment and 
        unemployment. Increased economic hardship would present ORC 
        groups with a larger pool of individuals potentially 
        susceptible to recruitment for booster operations, thus 
        providing ORC groups with the labor required to scale 
        operations to serve potential growth.
  <bullet> There are significant deficiencies in the availability of 
        consistent and consolidated data regarding ORC. The fragmentary 
        and disorganized state of data on ORC across national, State, 
        and local authorities, and the lack of standard centralized 
        information on ORC from the retail industry, present 
        difficulties to building a nuanced understanding of ORC's 
        national and regional prevalence, and operational trends. 
        Efforts to standardize and increase data collection on ORC 
        would help build understanding of key information gaps about 
        ORC that existing primary and secondary sources are unable to 
        fill.
    There is a basic pattern to how retail theft gangs are organized. 
First, there are ``boosters'' who are front-line thieves that steal 
directly from retail stores. They are often given a list of specific 
goods and quantities from a ``crew boss'' or ``fence.'' Crew bosses 
recruit and lead a group of boosters and communicate tactics and 
techniques to avoid loss prevention policies at retail stores. Fences 
are the intermediary that receives the stolen merchandise from the 
boosters and crew bosses. They may own or operate a front company, a 
warehouse, an ecommerce website, or establish a presence in an on-line 
marketplace. Fences employ ``cleaners,'' who are responsible for 
cleaning the stolen products. This includes removing anti-theft 
technology, altering expiration dates or repackaging the merchandise so 
it looks new and not stolen.
    In more complex organizations, there may be professional money 
launderers, as well as shell company operators who divert large 
quantities of stolen goods to wholesalers, liquidators, other 
legitimate retail businesses or pawn shops, or back into the retail 
supply chain. The operators who divert stolen goods may ship overseas 
to countries where American products are highly prized. Some of the 
most profitable organized retail crime groups that were stopped by law 
enforcement have shown ties to international criminal networks involved 
in identity theft, fraud, drug trafficking, and human trafficking.\6\

arrest three Houston-area residents, suspected ties to $65 million

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The property crimes Americans witness on the nightly news, or in 
person, are a small portion of larger criminal enterprises with global 
impact. Tactics range from basic shoplifting of large quantities of 
goods, to brazen smash-and-grab events, to sophisticated schemes 
exploiting gaps in security, to ``Mission Impossible''-style burglaries 
in the middle of the night.\7\ The profits derived from ORC are 
supporting a multitude of criminal activities across State and 
international borders. The consequences of these crimes are leading to 
higher prices that consumers pay, along with store closures and loss of 
job opportunities. Worst of all, retail workers are sometimes being 
killed.

                         policy recommendations
                         
    The National Retail Federation strongly supports and urges Congress 
to pass the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act (H.R. 895) and provide 
appropriate resources for implementation. This bipartisan legislation 
will create an interagency Organized Retail Crime Center located within 
Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and include participation by 
other Federal law enforcement agencies. The Center would align counter-
ORC activities by developing national-level ORC intelligence, 
facilitating information sharing across Federal, State, local, and 
Tribal agencies, and supporting multi-agency investigations. It will 
serve as a hub of expertise for training and technical assistance for 
State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies. The bill will also 
make changes to the U.S. criminal code to provide investigators and 
prosecutors increased enforcement tools to blunt organized retail crime 
activity. We believe that H.R. 895 appropriately places emphasis on 
these crimes and differentiates them from shoplifting for personal use, 
so that State and Federal law enforcement can support investigations 
that bring organized criminal activities to prosecution. We also 
believe that the establishment of this new Center can be undertaken 
within the scope of existing appropriations for HSI and other 
participating agencies. We applaud the 90-plus House Members who have 
co-sponsored this legislation.
    Homeland Security Investigations has significant experience in 
assisting law enforcement in bringing cases against some of the biggest 
organized theft groups. They have developed Operation Boiling Point \8\ 
to target domestic and transnational criminal groups profiting from 
ORC, cargo theft, and similar crimes. This experience ensures HSI can 
lead the interagency task force established in H.R. 895 and bring to 
bear greater investigatory and intelligence-gathering assets of the 
Federal Government. State and local police departments throughout the 
United States are under-staffed and sometimes have trouble dedicating 
resources to thefts and burglaries tied to complicated organized theft 
gangs. Federal intelligence sharing and investigation support will make 
a tremendous difference on the front lines of ORC.

    NRF strongly supported the INFORM Consumers Act, which Congress 
passed in 2022 and took effect in July. This legislation addresses the 
frequent resale of stolen merchandise by third-party sellers utilizing 
on-line marketplaces. It requires on-line marketplaces to verify the 
identity of individuals that sell a higher volume of goods. It 
appropriately protects the privacy of legitimate small businesses 
seeking to build their enterprise. This critical new law will begin to 
curb the resale of stolen merchandise and we appreciate Congress 
addressing this critical issue. However, curbing the resale of stolen 
merchandise is just one aspect of organized retail crime, and more must 
be done to protect our people, stores, and communities.

                               conclusion
                               
    Preventing organized retail crime and protecting their employees 
and customers will remain the top priority for all retailers Nation-
wide. Expenditures against retail theft have factored into retail 
budgets throughout the enterprise including construction, store 
operations, merchandising, information technology, loss prevention, and 
staffing and training. This is an enormously important and expensive 
effort for the retail industry. The continuing growth of organized 
retail crime and the damage it causes to communities dictates that 
something needs to be done to control the theft and resale market for 
stolen goods.
    If this criminal activity was solely a retail industry issue, 
retailers would have solved it by now. These crimes affect every single 
one of us. Passing H.R. 895 will further establish and memorialize the 
public-private partnerships necessary for information sharing among 
retailers, law enforcement, and financial institutions at the national 
level. While retailers will continue to invest billions of dollars in 
protecting their people, customers and assets from organized retail 
crime, the problem cannot be solved by fighting these cases one by one 
at the local level. It is difficult for retail investigators and law 
enforcement to bring a case of ORC to a successful prosecution. 
Criminals understand this and are threatening our workers, exploiting 
our businesses and flouting our laws. Today in the United States, 
organized retail crime pays, and it pays well. It is viewed as less 
dangerous for its perpetrators than more illicit crimes. We must change 
this equation and we ask Congress to support and pass H.R. 895, the 
Combating Organized Retail Crime Act, along with appropriate resources.
    The National Retail Federation deeply appreciates the subcommittee 
for examining organized retail crime today. Thank you, Members of the 
subcommittee, for your time today. We stand ready to work together to 
advance the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act, as well as other 
legislative proposals that will support our communities in preventing 
ORC and ultimately protect our people and customers.

       STATEMENT OF SUMMER STEPHAN, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, SAN 
         DIEGO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF 
         THE NATIONAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION

    Ms. Stephan. Thank you, Chairman Pfluger, Ranking Member 
Magaziner, and honorable Members of the subcommittee. My name 
is Summer Stephan. I'm San Diego County district attorney.
    Mr. Pfluger. Can you turn on your microphone? Thank you.
    Ms. Stephan. Should I start over?
    Good afternoon, Chairman Pfluger, Ranking Member Magaziner, 
and honorable Members of the subcommittee.
    My name is Summer Stephan, and I'm the elected district 
attorney of San Diego County and also the president-elect of 
the National District Attorneys Association.
    I've devoted my entire professional life to serving our 
communities and keeping it safe, 33 years. That's longer than 
I've been alive not doing this. This is why this issue is very 
important to me.
    It is not just an economic issue. If you go to the ground 
level and actually talk to the employees in the stores, you 
will sense the fear and the trauma and how much impact this has 
on human beings. There's hardly anyone who doesn't have a 
family member working in the retail industry. To subject an 
industry where they don't sign up for a world of law 
enforcement, where there are daily threats, they sign up for 
what should be a safe industry. Instead, it's turned into the 
Wild West.
    From my ground-level view, I appreciate bringing the voice 
of the victims to this committee and for your attention to this 
really, really important issue.
    You've heard the reports. The reports of the loss of jobs 
and also the reports about the increase in violence are the 
most important and impactful.
    I have made combatting retail theft and organized retail 
theft a priority in my office because of what I've seen, the 
impact it has on my community. I wanted to send a very clear 
message that we have the rule of law, that we will use every 
tool in our possession to bring justice and accountability.
    Because of that, I've formed a specialized team that has 
gone after this issue, organizing along with our State and 
local police officers, in order to identify the perpetrators.
    There are three key challenges. First, that the evolution 
of this criminal industry involves more networks that are more 
organized and therefore are better able to hide their identity, 
so usually masked up. They even have their license plates 
covered up. There's a lot of premeditation that goes into it, 
which means that our investigation efforts have to be more 
sophisticated.
    Second, we have a very inadequate legal framework, meaning 
we have very weak laws that deal with this--with these issues. 
This has helped this kind of crime become less accountable.
    The third key challenge is coordination, that there wasn't 
in the past good coordination between the retail industry, 
between local law enforcement, prosecutors, and the State- and 
Federal-level coordination.
    Here are just some examples in San Diego County to show you 
how prolific this is. By the way, we've prosecuted 76 
defendants for organized retail theft, and we track organized 
retail theft in our system separate from regular theft. 
Seventy-six defendants, only 3 cases that I'll mention are more 
than a million and a quarter. An Ulta store theft of $700,000 
of multiple stores, $435,000 in Victoria's Secret, $230,000 for 
the Sunglass Hut store. How many sunglasses can one person 
need?
    The prosecution was made possible by a new law that passed 
in 2019 that targets specifically organized retail theft and 
allows us to aggregate, something that we're not able to do for 
regular theft.
    By the way, Chairman Pfluger, your State was able, as you 
know recently, to put together a task force similar to what we 
have in San Diego.
    We also work with the California Highway Patrol because 
most of these organized thieves travel from county to county 
and they don't stick to one county, also making their detection 
difficult.
    We supported the INFORM Act, but the INFORM Act is not 
funded. So we encourage that there be funding specifically in 
order to better enforce the INFORM Act.
    Also, we support the coordination center that many Members 
of this committee has asked for us because being able to bring 
together the resources in one coordination center is a proven 
tool that is effective.
    Working with the NDAA, it has been a pleasure to see the 
coordinated efforts come to fruition including a national walk-
through where we walked through a hundred stores with other 
prosecutors' offices to see for ourselves the problems.
    Thank you very much for this opportunity. We stand ready to 
assist and answer any questions.

                  Prepared Statement of Summer Stephan
                  
                       Tuesday, December 12, 2023
                       
    Chairman Pfluger, Ranking Member Magaziner, and Members of the 
subcommittee: My name is Summer Stephan, and I am the elected district 
attorney for San Diego County, CA, and the president-elect of the 
National District Attorneys Association (NDAA).
    I've devoted my entire professional life to protecting my community 
from crime and violence. And I'm here to give you a prosecutor's 
perspective on the vital role we play in addressing the serious 
challenge and destructive impact of retail theft and organized retail 
crime. Organized retail theft poses a significant threat to businesses, 
employees, consumers, communities, and the overall economic stability 
of our Nation.
    From my ground-level view of looking in the eyes of employees in 
the retail industry, many are feeling unsafe and traumatized by these 
crimes. The impact is felt in both large retail and also small 
businesses. I view organized retail theft as an economic crime that 
threatens human beings and lives. This is why I'm honored to testify 
here today to bring you the voice of the victims. Retail theft and 
organized retail crime is not a victimless crime and I'm grateful for 
your deep investment and commitment as exemplified by this hearing.

                               background
                               
    Reports by industry associations show that billions of products 
have been stolen from U.S. retailers and that the losses continue to 
mount year after year. Another insidious impact of this crime is the 
report of jobs lost in the retail industry. From a prosecutor's 
perspective, also compelling are the reports of an increase in violence 
and aggression by the criminals committing these crimes.

                             key challenges
                             
    I have made combating retail theft and organized retail crime a 
priority in my office. I wanted to send a clear message to businesses, 
their employees, customers, and our community that we will follow the 
rule of law and bring accountability and justice. I formed a 
specialized team of prosecutors and investigators to fight organized 
retail theft and work with businesses and law enforcement to build 
stronger cases.
    We quickly identified three key challenges:
    First is the evolution of more sophisticated criminal networks. 
Organized retail theft is no longer just the work of isolated petty 
criminals. Instead, it has evolved into highly sophisticated 
operations, often conducted by well-organized networks and coordinated 
across multiple locations making identification and prosecution much 
more challenging.
    Second is an inadequate legal framework. Existing laws and 
penalties in many States are not sufficient to deter or appropriately 
punish criminals engaged in organized retail theft. Many States, 
including California, have passed laws that increased the dollar amount 
of theft to be charged with a felony to $950 or $1,000 and eliminated 
enhanced consequences for recidivist and habitual offenders. Law 
enforcement and retailers agree that the increase in retail theft-
related incidents has been the direct result of changing laws to 
lighten penalties for shoplifting. The message that these deficient 
laws send is that this is the Wild West with no rules or 
accountability.
    The third key challenge is coordination. In the past, the lack of 
coordination and information sharing among retailers, law enforcement 
agencies, and other stakeholders hindered the ability to combat 
organized retail theft effectively. A continued collaborative and 
multi-faceted approach is necessary to address this issue 
comprehensively.
    Here are some examples from San Diego County on the scope and 
sophistication of the retail theft, helpful legal frameworks, and 
enhanced coordination that we utilized to bring justice and 
accountability, which may offer a path forward for regions impacted 
across the United States.
    In a 1-year period, my office filed criminal cases involving 
organized retail theft against 76 defendants resulting in prison or 
jail terms for the majority of the criminals who have been convicted.
    In February of this year, two men were sentenced to 44 months in 
prison for a series of brazen, organized retail theft crimes where 
multiple Sunglass Hut store locations were targeted resulting in a 
reported loss of more than $230,000. Hundreds of pairs of sunglasses 
were stolen from 9 Sunglass Hut store locations, some of which were 
targeted more than once.
    Another theft ring stole more than $350,000 in Victoria's Secret 
merchandise over a 7-month period.
    We successfully prosecuted another retail theft crew for 42 felony 
counts for breaking into ULTA Beauty, Nordstrom Rack, and other stores.
    Those thieves caused over $700,000 in loss to businesses.
    This prosecution was made possible by a law passed in 2019 that 
allows aggregation on different theft dates and different stores but 
only as to organized retail theft which requires several elements to be 
met but doesn't apply to theft in general.
    It's a tactic that's now being adopted across the Nation.
    Almost all States now have partnerships between law enforcement and 
retailers, indicating a Nation-wide response to this type of crime.
    In fact, recently, Chairman Pfluger's home State of Texas joined 
the growing list of States that have created State-wide task forces to 
investigate and prosecute suspects involved in organized retail crimes.
    At least 34 States now have organized retail crime laws. It's 
important that these laws include increased penalties for those 
involved in these criminal activities and provisions that enable law 
enforcement to better investigate and prosecute offenders.
    My office has met with retailers, business association 
representatives, retail industry employee representatives, law 
enforcement, and others to discuss the scope of the problem in San 
Diego County. We communicated steps law enforcement is taking to stop 
and prosecute these types of crimes and discussed possible future 
prevention strategies.
    Partnering with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to educate their 
members on how to build better relationships with their law enforcement 
and prosecutors has been a positive solution.
    We have partnered with the California Highway Patrol's (CHP) 
Organized Retail Crime Task Force and as a result, several successful 
prosecutions have occurred. This proved valuable because these 
organized syndicates operate across county lines. CHP investigators 
build big cases for us to prosecute by acting as liaison between 
retailers and my office. This effort is also supported by the Organized 
Retail Crime Alliance which includes retailers, law enforcement, and 
prosecutors working together.
    They gather reports and video evidence, conduct surveillance, 
execute search warrants, return stolen product to retailers, and write 
complete investigative reports with spreadsheets of thefts and loss 
amounts so we can prosecute defendants for as many thefts in one case 
as possible.
    There are additional promising enhanced legal frameworks on the 
horizon.
    Congress recently passed the INFORM Act, which requires on-line 
marketplaces, like Amazon and eBay, to collect, verify, and disclose 
certain information from high-volume sellers and provide consumers with 
means to report suspicious activity.
    This is a step in the right direction to stop organized criminals 
from selling stolen goods on on-line marketplaces. It removes the 
anonymity of the seller and makes it easier for law enforcement to find 
these on-line sellers of stolen goods and prosecute them.
    This law directly addresses the interstate aspects of organized 
retail theft--something I know this committee is concerned about.
    But it's key that there is funding for enforcement of the INFORM 
Act so the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Attorney General, Federal, 
and county prosecutors can identify on-line sellers of stolen goods and 
take action to hold them accountable.
    Also, I appreciate Representatives Magaziner, Titus, D'Esposito, 
and Correa for the co-sponsorship of H.R. 895, the Combating Organized 
Retail Crime Act of 2023--which would expand Federal enforcement of 
criminal offenses related to organized retail crime and establish an 
Organized Retail Crime Coordination Center within the Department of 
Homeland Security. We know that an investment in technology consistent 
with this proposed law can be a game changer.
    Recently we used a similar model in San Diego to combat elder scams 
through an Elder Justice Task Force.

    policies and partnerships to change behavior on a national level
    
    There is some positive news to share in our fight to combat retail 
theft and organized retail crime that stands out as a model for 
stronger collaboration.
    In August 2022, the National District Attorneys Association (NDAA) 
and the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA) announced the first-
of-its-kind national partnership to combat retail crime.
    Earlier this Spring, the two organizations also announced the 
launch of its Vibrant Communities Initiative, an innovative pilot 
project to address root drivers of habitual theft, violence, and other 
unlawful activity. This initiative brings together prosecutors, 
retailers, law enforcement, social service organizations, policy 
makers, and the business community to increase information sharing, 
assist in the prosecution of habitual and violent offenders.
    In September, NDAA and RILA convened a National Store Walk Month 
where prosecutors Nation-wide walked retail stores with management 
teams providing both parties with an exchange of insights and 
comprehensive understanding of challenges. Almost 100 walks occurred.
    My specialized Organized Retail Crime team participated in store 
walks at Home Depot, Dick's Sporting Goods, Target, Walmart, Lowes, and 
Ulta Beauty. That particular Ulta store in San Marcos, California, that 
I visited was 1 of 21 area Ulta stores that last year, fell victim to 
smash-and-grab crews. In just 1 month, the thieves stole $127,000 of 
expensive perfumes from those stores. I also toured Sunny Perfumes; a 
small business that has also been targeted by retail thieves. The 
owner, Sunil, shared with me that he's spent thousands of dollars 
repairing smashed windows and adding metal shutters for security and 
has had to move his more expensive perfumes to the back while leaving 
cheaper perfumes more accessible.
    We can't lay the blame at the feet of retailers on this issue, 
expecting them to lock up even more products away from customers and 
take a further business loss. Instead, collaborative approaches are 
leading us to a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges at 
hand and we're cultivating a united, efficient response to combat them.

                      approaches to accountability

    When it comes to prosecuting these cases, we simply need to restore 
the rule of law and have balanced accountability that fits the crime. 
Prosecutors should continue to pursue justice by assessing and 
differentiating a youthful offender that had a lapse of judgment as 
compared to what we see in organized retail theft or habitual theft, 
which involves premeditated criminal behavior and lawlessness.

                          action must be taken

    In addition to common-sense legislation; increased coordination and 
collaboration; and strategic, focused prosecutions, public awareness 
can be effective.
    The Federal Government can consider launching a public awareness 
campaign to educate consumers about the consequences of purchasing 
stolen goods on-line or at swap meets, and the role they can play in 
reducing organized retail theft. A well-informed public can act as an 
additional deterrent to these criminal activities.
    NDAA and RILA recently launched a joint website that is very 
successful in raising awareness by providing additional resources on 
focus areas and public policy, news, blogs, and events.
    I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you about these important 
and complex issues. The office of the district attorney of San Diego 
County and NDAA stand ready to assist as we look for ways to tackle 
organized retail crime and retail theft that threatens the vibrancy of 
our communities.

    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Ms. Stephan.
    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Glenn for your opening 
statement of 5 minutes.

       STATEMENT OF SCOTT GLENN, VICE PRESIDENT, ASSET
                 PROTECTION, THE HOME DEPOT

    Mr. Glenn. Good afternoon.
    Chairman Pfluger, Ranking Member Magaziner, and Members of 
the subcommittee, on behalf of the Home Depot and our 470,000-
plus associates, I thank you for the opportunity to speak to 
you today about retail--organized retail crime and its growing 
impact on the retail community.
    My name is Scott Glenn, and I'm the vice president of asset 
protection at the Home Depot. We operate over 2,000 big-box 
retail stores in the United States, and my job is to ensure the 
protection of our associates, customers, and assets.
    I'm here today to talk about why ORC is an increasing 
problem to our customers and associates and how we can work 
together to stop this threat.
    A critical step that Congress can and should take to help 
stop--to stop this brazen theft is to pass the Combatting 
Organized Retail Crime Act. Many have asked if retailers and 
the media are overhyping the problem. The fact is that 
retailers were faced with many challenges over the past few 
years, and ORC is one that's clearly sustained. Its impact has 
caused the Home Depot and many of our peer retailers to take 
measures that we would not even have considered years ago.
    Today we're locking up valuable product, employing off-duty 
police and security officers, and even putting police cars on 
the front aprons of our stores, along with many other tactics 
that we wouldn't have used in the past.
    Despite these efforts, the problem continues. We've even 
tragically lost a few associates to this issue as was noted in 
the opening statement.
    So in short, the answer's no. Retailers are not 
exaggerating the problem. We know first-hand in our stores the 
impact has grown incrementally. While at some level theft is a 
cost of doing business, the recent rise in ORC and its 
consequences are what bring me here today.
    There's the myth that ORC rings happen only in big cities. 
Unfortunately, criminals don't discriminate when it come to 
targeting stores, and ORC is happening everywhere in urban and 
suburban environments and everywhere in between.
    Generally, the intent of ORC bad actors is to resell and 
monetize produce as quickly as possible. Our law enforcement 
partners often find these crimes linked to other more sinister 
activities such as drug, gun, and even human trafficking.
    I want to be very clear that we're not talking about petty 
shoplifting. We're talking about theft for need--for greed, not 
theft for need and in many cases theft to fund on-going 
criminal enterprises.
    This large-scale, multi-jurisdictional activity that is 
carefully choreographed, sophisticated criminal rings are 
recruiting individuals from vulnerable populations to steal.
    As I stated, my top priority is customer and associate 
safety. Since 2020, we've seen a significant uptick in our 
store and asset protection associates coming into violent 
contact with bad actors. These individuals are becoming 
increasingly aggressive. They are dangerous and often care 
little about any consequence other than getting out of store 
with as much as possible. Our associates have been threatened 
with knives, guns, and other physical attacks.
    I believe there's three primary root causes for this 
increase: First, the availability of drugs, particularly 
opioids and fentanyl, and specifically their availability has 
driven a need for easy and fast cash.
    Second, the rise of third-party marketplaces allows 
criminals to anonymously resell stolen or counterfeit goods. We 
see this happening even on reputable platforms what has made it 
easy to monetize product and sell them at scale. To fight this, 
the Home Depot strongly supported the Informed Consumers Act.
    The last contributor is an increasing lack of resources of 
support for local, State, and Federal law enforcement 
opportunity--assistance. Retailers need help in disrupting 
these criminal activities.
    But let's talk about solutions. The Home Depot is working 
hard to address all three underlying causes. First, we've grown 
our investigative team by over 180 percent since 2016. In 
stores, we're using technology and physical deterrence. These 
include everything from increased security personnel, to secure 
lock-up enclosures, to smart shopping carts, to machine 
learning and data analysis.
    We've also launched a program called Game Plan where we 
invite local law enforcement and politicians to visit our 
stores and see this technology and tactics in action and to 
help educate proactively and build relationships.
    To address on-line concerns, we've added resources and 
implemented technology tools to identify bad actors using the 
cover of on-line marketplaces.
    A Federal task force would allow us to expand upon the 
progress made at local and State levels and give us all a 
greatly-needed Nation-wide partner.
    The Home Depot strongly supports the bipartisan Combatting 
Organized Retail Crime Act introduced in the House by 
Representatives Buck, Titus, Joyce, and Lee and in the Senate 
by Senator Cortez Masto and Grassley and supported by several 
Members of this subcommittee including Representatives 
Magaziner, D'Esposito, Correa, Gonzales, and Goldman.
    As a professional in the field of protecting customers and 
associates, I ask that all Members of Congress work together to 
ensure that the Combatting Organized Retail Crime Act becomes 
the law of the land to help stop these senseless crimes in our 
communities.
    I thank you for the opportunity to tell our stories and 
look forward to answering questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Glenn follows:]
    
                   Prepared Statement of Scott Glenn
                   
                           December 12, 2023
                           
    Chairman Pfluger, Ranking Member Magaziner, and Members of the 
subcommittee, on behalf of The Home Depot and our 470,000 associates, I 
thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today about organized 
retail crime, which I'll refer to as ORC, and its growing impact on the 
retail community.
    My name is Scott Glenn, and I am the vice president of asset 
protection for The Home Depot. We operate over 2,000 stores in the 
United States and my job is to ensure the protection and security of 
our associates, our customers, and our assets.
    I'm here today to talk about why ORC is an increasing threat to 
customers and associates that walk into retail stores every day, and 
how we can work together to stop it.
    A critical step that Congress can take to help us stop this brazen 
theft is to pass the Combatting Organized Retail Crime Act.
    Many have asked if retailers and the media are overhyping the

    The fact is that retailers were faced with many challenges over the

its impact has caused The Home Depot and many of my peers to take

    We've been locking up product, employing off-duty police officers 
and security guards, and putting police cars at the front of our stores 
along with many other tactics. Despite these efforts, the problem 
continues, and we have tragically even lost associates to these 
encounters.
    So in short, the answer is no, retailers are not exaggerating the 
problem of theft. We know first-hand that the impact has grown 
significantly. While at some level, theft is a cost of doing business, 
the recent rise in ORC and its consequences are what bring me here 
today.
    We have seen an alarming rise in the frequency and aggressiveness 
of organized and professional criminal groups stealing from our stores.
    There is a myth that these ORC rings happen only in big cities. 
Unfortunately, criminals and bad actors don't discriminate when it 
comes to targeting stores, and organized retail crime is happening 
everywhere--in urban and suburban areas and everywhere in between.
    Generally, the intent of ORC actors is to resell and monetize the

these crimes linked to other more sinister activities such as drug, 
gun, and even human trafficking.
    I want to be very clear that we are not talking about petty 
shoplifting--not theft for need but theft for greed. And in many cases, 
theft to fund on-going criminal enterprises.
    This is large-scale, multi-jurisdictional activity that is 
carefully choreographed. Sophisticated criminal rings are recruiting 
individuals from vulnerable populations to steal.
    They regularly sell the product through on-line third-party 
platforms quickly and anonymously. At The Home Depot, a significant 
number of all ORC cases involve an on-line marketplace.
    As I stated, my top priority is customer and associate safety. 
Since 2020, we have seen a significant uptick in our store and asset 
protection associates coming into violent contact with criminal actors.
    These individuals are becoming increasingly aggressive. They are 
dangerous and often care little about any consequence other than 
getting out of the store with as much product as possible. Our 
associates have been threatened with knives, guns, and other physical 
attacks.
    We believe there are three primary reasons for this increase.
    First, the availability of drugs, opioids, and fentanyl 
specifically and increased availability has driven a need for easy and 
fast cash.
    Many of those we call ``boosters'' in these operations are simply 
pawns for higher-level fences and criminal organizations to commit 
their crimes.
    Organized retail crime is often connected to other illicit 
activities. According to Homeland Security Investigations, organized 
theft groups also engage in cyber crime, money laundering, drug 
trafficking, terrorism financing, weapons trafficking, and 
transnational organized crime.
    Second, the rise of third-party marketplaces allows criminals to 
anonymously resell stolen or counterfeit goods. We see this happening 
even on reputable on-line platforms, which have made it easy to 
monetize goods and sell them at scale.
    To fight this, The Home Depot strongly supported the INFORM 
Consumers Act, a bipartisan bill led by Representatives Schakowsky, 
Castor, and Bilirakis that went into effect in June of this year.
    The last contributor is an increasing lack of resources and support 
needed by local, State, and Federal law enforcement to assist 
retailers, our associates, customers, and broader communities to 
disrupt criminal networks.
    Many police departments across the country are perpetually and 
significantly understaffed and this results in less support for 
retailers and the broader community.
    We see policies such as increased felony thresholds and lack of 
aggregation as creating an environment where little can be done by 
retailers alone to address the issue.
    But let me talk about solutions.
    The Home Depot is working hard to address all three underlying 
causes. First, we have grown our investigative team over 180 percent 
since 2016 and have increased our overall budgets by tens of millions 
of dollars.
    In our stores, we are using technology and physical deterrents. 
These include everything from increased security personnel to secure 
lock-up enclosures, to smart shopping carts, to machine learning and 
data analysis tools.
    We've also launched a program called ``Game Plan,'' where we invite 
local law enforcement and politicians to visit stores and see our 
technology and tactics in action, in order to educate and build 
relationships proactively.
    To address on-line concerns, we have added resources and 
implemented tools to identify bad actors using the anonymity of on-line 
marketplaces.
    While these marketplaces are a convenient outlet for the second-
hand consumer market, legitimate resellers would not be selling 
branded, new-in-box products at prices better than national retailers.
    The platforms simply need to do more in terms of accountability to 
mitigate illegitimate sales and outright fraud.
    We work in close partnership with local, State, and Federal law 
enforcement to build case files and help dismantle these networks 
through public-private coordination and task forces.
    We have worked closely with more than a dozen State attorneys 
general who have established task forces over the past 2 years to 
better protect their communities and businesses.
    Let me give you an example of this type of partnership. During a 
recent investigation in Little Rock, Arkansas, a booster, the 
individual who steals the product for a ringleader, admitted to 
stealing over $1 million dollars of product from Home Depot and selling 
it on Facebook Marketplace.
    He used this cash to buy and distribute large amounts of fentanyl. 
Our investigators worked with Homeland Security and the Little Rock 
Police Department, and our evidence was used to conduct controlled 
sales to the fence. The suspects were ultimately arrested and charged 
under a Federal indictment.
    A Federal task force would allow us to expand upon the progress 
made at local and State levels, like this case in Arkansas, and give 
all of us a greatly-needed Nation-wide partner.
    The Home Depot supports the bipartisan Combatting Organized Retail 
Crime Act (S. 140/H.R. 895), introduced in the House by Representatives 
Buck, Titus, Joyce, and Lee, and in the Senate by Senators Cortez-Masto 
and Grassley.
    I'm pleased to see that the House bill has over 90 bipartisan 
cosponsors. The bill would create the Organized Retail Crime 
Coordination Center bringing together Federal, State, and local law 
enforcement and private-sector experts to share information and 
collaborate on strategies to keep our stores safe and secure.
    The bill would allow us to expand upon the progress made at the 
local and State levels and address cases that reach certain thresholds 
or cross State lines.
    As a professional in the field of protecting customers and 
associates, I ask that all Members of Congress work together to ensure 
that the Combatting Organized Retail Crime Act urgently becomes the law 
of the land to help stop these senseless crimes in our communities.
    Thank you for the opportunity to tell our story, and I look forward 
to answering your questions.

    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Mr. Glenn.
    The Chair now recognizes Ms. Jagoda for your opening 
statement.

       STATEMENT OF ABBY JAGODA, VICE PRESIDENT, PUBLIC
       POLICY, INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF SHOPPING CENTERS

    Ms. Jagoda. Chairman Pfluger, Ranking Member Magaziner, and 
distinguished Members of the subcommittee, I'm pleased to 
appear before you today with our partnering organizations and 
leaders to discuss the strategies of the International Council 
of Shopping Centers, or ICSC, in combatting organized retail 
crime, or ORC.
    ICSC's nearly 50,000 North American members represent 
marketplace professionals including owner-developers of retail 
centers, as well as retail tenants, investors, economic 
development, and legal professionals. ICSC promotes industry 
advancement for the spaces where people shop, dine, work, play, 
and gather as foundational and vital ingredients of communities 
and economies.
    Today's retail centers are no strangers to change. Many in 
this room might remember with fondness their first job, their 
first date, or providing your wish list to the mall's Santa 
Claus. Where you once might have found department stores or 
food court dining, you might now discover fitness centers, 
breweries, animal shelters, or pickleball courts. But despite 
these changes, traditional retailers remain the overwhelming 
majority of shopping center tenants, and 70 percent of them are 
small businesses.
    Sadly, retail property owners are facing an unprecedented 
number of ORC incidents. ORC involves the illegal acquisition 
of retail merchandise in substantial quantities through both 
theft and fraud as part of an unlawful commercial enterprise. 
As Ranking Member Magaziner noted, it's important to 
distinguish ORC from traditional shoplifting or a single 
individual breaking the law.
    Traditional shoplifting is part of a largely spontaneous 
and self-serving activity, typically executed by individuals 
who need merchandise for personal use they simply cannot 
afford. Those small-scale shoplifters should not avoid 
prosecution. ICSC recognizes that many of these individuals 
need to be treated separately from those who operate as part of 
a larger commercial enterprise focused on making a profit 
through the resale of stolen goods.
    ORC puts a more serious strain on business owners, 
particularly small businesses, in multiple ways including 
shopper and employee safety, reputational risk, and financial 
stability.
    ORC syndicates focus on the theft and resale of high-value 
branded items that are in demand from shoppers from designer 
handbags to name-brand laundry detergent. When these goods are 
resold using an on-line marketplace or other means of sale, 
most consumers are unaware that they're purchasing stolen 
goods.
    While high-profile smash-and-grab robberies and Nation-wide 
cases involving major retailers garner headlines this holiday 
season, the problem is pervasive, impacting shopping centers, 
large and small, in all regions of the country.
    One major enclosed mall owner reports that retail crime 
theft incidents of over a thousand dollars have nearly doubled 
over the past 8 years. Violent crime including aggravated 
assault, battery, and armed robberies have nearly tripled at 
those retail centers. This is just what property owners know.
    Many retail employees have stopped reporting incidents to 
local authorities, including on-site security, because they 
question whether police response will be timely or effective or 
because they fear retaliation from thieves and their handlers. 
This pattern contributes to a lack of prosecution of ORC cases 
and leads to difficulties in allocating public and private 
resources to combat ORC.
    Here's some pragmatic steps that Congress and law 
enforcement can take to address ORC. First, building on the 
success of State and local ORC coordination centers, Congress 
can pass legislation to create a Federal interagency ORC task 
force. As my colleagues noted, there's broad bipartisan support 
for CORCA including many Members of this committee.
    CORCA can make a meaningful impact on ORC by activating 
this Federal coordination center, while also ensuring criminal 
penalties address the reality of how ORC enterprises operate.
    Second, the Federal appropriations process can also provide 
Federal law enforcement and agencies the resources and a 
mandate to investigate and prosecute ORC rings more 
effectively. Appropriators funded similar and successful HSI 
initiatives to combat IP theft with the creation of The 
National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, and 
we understand CORCA authors sought to replicate that success 
and use it as a model for the Federal ORC coordination center.
    This coordination center is a natural next step to build on 
the effectiveness of HSI's Operating Boiling Point 2.0 and the 
accomplishments of the State and local ORC task forces.
    Despite the rise in e-commerce in recent years, brick-and-
mortar stores remain the main sales channel for most goods and 
services purchased in the United States. However, the rise in 
ORC has contributed to the reasons why some retailers have 
chosen to close store locations, and those close closures 
should not be taken lightly. They result in the significant 
loss of jobs, diminished State and local sales tax, loss of 
property tax collected, and food and prescription drug deserts.
    On behalf of ICSC, I thank the subcommittee and my fellow 
witnesses for their interest and attention to this issue.

                   Prepared Statement of Abby Jagoda
                   
                           December 12, 2023
                           
    Chairman Pfluger, Ranking Member Magaziner, and distinguished 
Members of the subcommittee, I am pleased to appear before you today 
with our partnering organizations and leaders to discuss the strategies 
of International Council of Shopping Centers, Inc. (ICSC) and its 
members in combatting organized retail crime, or ORC.
    ICSC's nearly 50,000 members in North America represent marketplace 
professionals, from retail center owner/developers to retailers to 
financiers and investors, the legal community, economic development 
officers and academics. ICSC promotes industry advancement and elevates 
the marketplaces and spaces where people shop, dine, work, play, and 
gather as foundational and vital ingredients of communities and 
economies. Seventy percent of shopping center tenants are small 
businesses.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ ICSC data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Today's retail centers are no strangers to change. Many in this 
room likely remember with fondness their first job, their first date, 
or providing your wish list to the mall's Santa Claus. Where once you 
might have found department stores and food court dining, you might now 
discover fitness centers, breweries, animal shelters, or pickleball 
courts. But despite the changes, traditional retailers remain the 
overwhelming majority of shopping center tenants.
    Sadly, retail property owners are facing an unprecedented number of 
ORC incidents. ORC involves the illegal acquisition of retail 
merchandise in substantial quantities through both theft and fraud as 
part of an unlawful commercial enterprise. It is important to 
distinguish ORC from traditional shoplifting--or a single individual 
breaking the law. Traditional shoplifting is often done in response to 
food insecurity, substance abuse, or other mental health issues. It is 
largely spontaneous and self-serving. Though small-scale shoplifters 
should not avoid prosecution, ICSC recognizes that many of these 
individuals need to be treated separately from those who operate as 
part of a larger criminal enterprise focused on making a profit through 
the resale of stolen goods. ORC puts a more serious strain on business 
owners, particularly small businesses, in multiple ways, including 
customer and employee safety, reputation, and financial stability.
    While high-profile ``smash-n-grab'' robberies and Nation-wide cases 
involving major retailers garner the headlines this holiday season, the 
problem is pervasive, impacting retailers and centers large and small 
in all regions of the country. One major enclosed mall owner reports 
that retail crime theft incidents of over $1,000 have nearly doubled 
over the past 8 years. Violent crime, including aggravated assault, 
battery, and armed robberies have nearly tripled at those retail 
centers. And this is just what property owners know: many retail 
employees have simply stopped reporting incidents to local authorities, 
including on-site security, because they fear retaliation from thieves 
and their handlers. This behavior contributes to lack of prosecutions 
of ORC cases, and leads to difficulties in allocating public and 
private resources to combat ORC. This pattern of strained communication 
speaks to the necessity of formalized coordination among all 
stakeholders.
    Thirteen States have passed legislation to create ORC task forces. 
We know State and local measures can be effective means of combatting 
ORC, but a comprehensive approach including Federal law enforcement 
would be more effective.
    Here are some pragmatic steps Congress and law enforcement can take 
to address ORC. First, building on the success of State and local ORC 
coordination centers, Congress can pass legislation to create a Federal 
interagency ORC taskforce. There is broad bipartisan support for H.R. 
895 the ``Combating Organized Retail Crime Act of 2023'' (CORCA). CORCA 
can make a meaningful impact on ORC by activating a Federal 
coordination center, while also ensuring criminal penalties address the 
reality of how ORC enterprises operate. We thank Ranking Member 
Magaziner, and committee Members Titus, D'Esposito, and Correa for 
their co-sponsorship of this important legislation.
    Second, the Federal appropriations process can also provide Federal 
law enforcement agencies the resources and a mandate to investigate and 
prosecute ORC rings. Appropriators funded a similar and successful HSI 
initiative to combat IP theft with the creation of the National 
Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center. We understand CORCA 
authors sought to replicate that success and use it as a model for the 
Federal ORC Coordination Center.
    Despite the rise in e-commerce in recent years, brick-and-mortar 
stores remain the main sales channel for most goods and services 
purchased in the United States.\2\ However, the rise in ORC has 
contributed to the reasons why some retailers have chosen to close 
store locations. Store closures should not be taken lightly: they 
result in a significant loss of jobs, diminished State and local sales 
tax, loss of property tax collected, and food and prescription drug 
deserts. For instance, one grocery store typically creates $2.4 million 
in annual State and local sales tax and has an average of 133 jobs; a 
general merchandise store yields approximately $5.2 million and has an 
average of 188 jobs.* Store closures impact the entire ecosystem of a 
retail center and the community that it serves.

    On behalf of ICSC I thank the subcommittee and fellow witnesses for 
their interest and attention to this issue.

             Examples of Successful ORC Task Force Activity
             
    California.--Since the inception of California's ORC Task Force in 
2019, there have been more than 1,850 investigations into retail crimes 
in California that have resulted in over 1,250 arrests as of August 
2023.* Led by California Highway Patrol, the key to the ORCTF's success 
is the partnership with retailers, property owners, local law 
enforcement, and district attorneys, to effectively disrupt organized 
retail theft rings and prosecute organized retail crimes. In the first 
5 weeks of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Organized 
Retail Theft Task Force, teams made 89 arrests and $370,000 worth of 
stolen goods was recovered.
    Texas.--Comptroller Glen Hagar chairs an ORC Task Force consisting 
of a combination of representatives from retailers--Amazon, eBay, H-E-
B, and several others--along with several law enforcement and State 
agencies.* The United to Safeguard America from Illegal Trade (USA-IT) 
organization says retail thefts in Texas totaled nearly $4 billion last 
year and cost State and local governments more than $343 million.
    New England.--The New England Organized Retail Crime Alliance 
(NEORCA) is a group of retailers who collaborate with law enforcement 
aimed at reducing property crimes, keeping shoppers safer and lessening 
their chances of becoming victims. An information-sharing platform was 
established to allow NEORCA members to share information on ORC.*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * ICSC data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    New York.--Last month, the chief of police in Syracuse said that 
the city has seen a 55 percent spike in shoplifting since 2021--and 
that's a conservative estimate because it doesn't account for 
unreported incidents. The Retail Council of New York State says that 
store owners lost $4.4 billion in 2022 from theft alone.* New York City 
reports about a 50 percent increase in retail theft complaints across 
the city since 2018.*
    Arizona.--In early October, Phoenix Police announced that from 
September 12 to 15, 248 warrants were cleared, 64 people were arrested 
and 5 guns were seized as part of a multi-agency investigation into 
organized retail crime.
    Washington.--In 2023, Washington State's Attorney General created a 
centralized Organized Retail Crime Unit to coordinate, investigate, and 
prosecute multi-jurisdictional retail crime State-wide. This 
centralized unit has been praised by retail workers union and the 
business community alike, and just last month announced the first 
criminal prosecution by the newly established Organized Retail Crime 
Unit.*
    Illinois.--Attorney General Kwame Raoul has distributed out almost 
$5 million to nearly 2 dozen communities, including Oak Brook, Gurnee, 
Naperville, and Orland Park. The Illinois Organized Retail Crime Task 
Force funded 25 police departments throughout the State. The task force 
pays for everything from overtime to license plate readers and 
surveillance systems that allow police to see what's happening before 
they even arrive.*

   Examples of Investments by Property Owners in Securing Shoppers, 
                         Workers, and Products
                         
    To thwart ORC operations, owners of retail centers have made 
substantial investments in advanced operational analytics, biometric 
data, license plate readers, heat maps, and other sophisticated 
technologies to help stem the tide of ORC without negatively impacting 
the customer experience. The reality is that some retailers have had to 
sacrifice the shopper experience by locking products behind Plexi-glass 
barriers. This technique, while ensuring product security, has had the 
effect of deterring customers from shopping in person.
    Despite these investments, technology can only do so much because 
addressing the retail crime problem will require policy change. These 
investments are also conditioned on the effectiveness of prosecution.
    The Loss Prevention Research Council (LPRC), based at the 
University of Florida, explains the below use of technology:

``Advanced case management and investigations enable collaboration 
within and between organizations because loss prevention practitioners 
can enter suspect information into a common database which can then be 
reviewed by others within the organization, or at other partnering 
organizations. This allows them to build cases (i.e., link multiple 
incidents to the same case). This is desirable because large cases (in 
terms of dollar amount) are more attractive to prosecutors and 
therefore more likely to be prosecuted. These offenders are also the 
ones creating the greatest losses to retailers.
``Other technologies include license plate readers that enable 
retailers to enroll license plates into a system and then receive 
alerts when a vehicle associated with retail crimes enters parking 
lots. The same is true of face-matching systems. These systems are 
being narrowly used for forensic purposes--that is, when an individual 
is found to be committing retail crimes, they are enrolled in face-
matching software. Then a retrospective search is conducted using 
available footage (e.g., past 30 days of retained footage)--this 
enables them to identify and investigate the times the suspect(s) were 
in their stores. Futhermore, this technology enables real-time alerts 
if retailers choose to use this option--once a suspect is identified 
and enrolled, retailers can receive alerts when that individual enters 
a store. Retailers are being very cautious to limit these programs and 
only use them for crime prevention and investigations.
``Another solution is RFID. RFID enables item-level serialization of 
merchandise and other assets. Retailers know what is sold at the POS--
if they know what merchandise leaves the store, they can reconcile 
transactions with merchandise leaving the store and identify likely 
thefts. This is not possible with current EAS systems because they do 
not enable item-level serialization. RFID can enable retailers to 
identify what is leaving a store, how many items, and exactly when 
those items left the store. These systems can be integrated with CCTV 
systems to capture footage of likely suspects. One of the most time-
consuming aspects of retail crime investigations is reviewing video, so 
this can drastically reduce the amount of time required to identify a 
suspect.
``However, once the RFID tag has left the building, it is still able to 
transmit a signal if it is pinged with a reader. Therefore, retail 
investigators and law enforcement can enter suspected fencing locations 
with a handheld RFID reader in a backpack and pick up all of the RFID 
tags associated with theft incidents. In other words, solutions like 
this help to link stolen merchandise at fencing and processing sites 
with the store where the theft occurred. This would also be useful for 
identifying that merchandise that is acquired during a controlled buy 
was stolen; for example, retailers will purchase merchandise on-line in 
hopes of determining whether the seller is selling stolen merchandise--
RFID would streamline this process. For more solutions that I believe 
are promising or that have evidence of effectiveness, see (https://
losspreventionmedia.com/technology-alone-will-not-solve-the-problem/
).''

                   ECONOMIC FALLOUT OF STORE CLOSINGS
                   
    When stores start closing due to rising ORC, the effects are loss 
of jobs, loss of State and local sales tax-generated, loss of property 
tax collected and a blight on the community. One grocery store 
typically creates $2.4 million in annual State and local sales tax and 
has an average of 133 jobs; a general merchandise store yields 
approximately $5.2 million and has an average of 188 jobs, a single 
drugstore generates nearly $1.2 million with an average of 27 jobs and 
a single apparel store, $423,000 with an average of 32 jobs. If store 
closings start increasing, sales tax and job losses quickly multiply, 
and the problems escalate.

    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you.
    The Chair will now recognize Members in order of seniority 
for their questions.
    I at this time recognize myself for questions.
    Ms. Stephan, thank you for your testimony.
    Do weak penalties embolden organized retail crime and 
organized retail criminals?
    Ms. Stephan. Based on my experience and the experience of 
my team, we believe it does. One of the facts that we rely on 
is we didn't even see organized retail crime or the smash-and-
grabs, these brazen type thefts of hundreds of thousands of 
dollars until California passed a law that elevated the level 
for a felony crime to $950. It also----
    Mr. Pfluger. If I may, can I ask: Has that had an impact on 
what happened in Los Angeles, the $300,000 of ransacking that 
happened at a Nordstrom, the thousands of dollars that happened 
at a Nike store in Los Angeles?
    Ms. Stephan. Well, we are the second-largest county in 
California. So I assume that our experience--and fifth-largest 
county in the United States--would have some bearing on other 
counties.
    Mr. Pfluger. Yes.
    Ms. Stephan. I mean, that law, the California law is across 
every county in California. It--the key problem is it didn't 
allow for first time or second time. There's no aggregation. 
You can steal every day of the week just under $950, and it's 
the same penalties.
    Mr. Pfluger. So criminals are coming back every day of the 
week, and they're stealing.
    Ms. Stephan. And it's still a misdemeanor.
    Mr. Pfluger. They're not being prosecuted.
    Ms. Stephan. Well, they're being prosecuted in San Diego--
--
    Mr. Pfluger. OK.
    Ms. Stephan [continuing]. Because we believe but it doesn't 
mean that it can be a deterrent because it's always going to be 
a misdemeanor.
    Mr. Pfluger. Uh-huh.
    Ms. Stephan. They're not going to remain in custody.
    Mr. Pfluger. You know what's interesting? Sorry to cut you 
off. But our previous witnesses on the Government panel 
wouldn't talk about the thresholds. They wouldn't talk about 
deterrents. But what I'm hearing from y'all's testimony is that 
deterrent matters.
    I'll go to Mr. Johnston at this time. Are your member 
companies scared? Are their employees scared? Do--does that 
have an effect on the consumers being scared to go into retail 
stores because of this?
    Mr. Johnston. Yes, thank you for your question, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Yes, this is not a victimless crime. Employees, consumers, 
communities, we are all victims of organized retail crime.
    Our retailers have reported, as I alluded in my oral 
testimony, many of them have seen increases of 100 percent or 
more over last year, which many have also--those were all-time 
highs to begin with last year, injuries, deaths.
    So employees are fearful. No employee should wish to go to 
work in fear for their job. No employee should have to quit or 
leave a job for fear.
    Mr. Pfluger. Well, I agree with that. Just today here in 
northwest District of Columbia, it was reported on Wisconsin 
Avenue that 5 to 6 guys with guns ordered everyone in a Verizon 
store to the floor and robbed that store for, you know, the 
phones and the other technology that was in it.
    Mr. Glenn, I'm so sorry for the losses that Home Depot has 
had. That's just horrific. Are your employees at Home Depot 
scared for their lives when they go to work because of the rise 
in organized retail crime?
    Mr. Glenn. Thank you for the question. I appreciate the 
chance to answer that.
    What I would say is, is that I think we've been at the 
forefront of trying to protect our associates and take the 
appropriate steps to make them feel as if they're entering a 
safe environment. We start at the parking lot. We bring it 
inward. We train other associates. We overtrain our associates 
on deescalation, to be great witnesses, to not engage with bad 
actors.
    So while there is a broader, you know, fear out there in 
the environment, I think that we've done a nice job of making 
our associates feel good.
    Mr. Pfluger. Mr. Johnston, I asked the previous witnesses 
if they see trends. Are there cities in the United States that 
have a higher level of organized retail crime?
    Ms. Stephan testified that in San Diego that they're 
prosecuting but maybe not in Los Angeles County. Do you see 
trends across the United States, cities where it's higher, 
higher levels of incidents?
    Mr. Johnston. We do have an annual survey that goes out to 
our retail members that one of the questions is where do they 
often see the highest levels of organized retail crime, and we 
do provide a top ten list. It is based on their responses. It 
is based on their experiences and their internal data.
    But that is not to say that, along with my fellow panelists 
and the previous panel, organized retail crime groups, they 
prey on wherever and however they can obtain their goods and 
their dollars.
    Mr. Pfluger. But if, as Ms. Stephan was saying, if you have 
a nonaggregated penalty day in and day out, $950, doesn't that 
add to a criminal's mindset that they're going to take 
advantage of that if they know they're going to only be 
prosecuted for a misdemeanor instead of a felony?
    Mr. Johnston. I would agree with that. Our retailers do see 
that aggregation can play a large role in deterrence where, you 
know, an individual act, an organized retail crime is not a 
singular act. It's conducted in multiple acts, multiple 
perpetrators in an organized effort.
    So aggregation can be of great support and assistance in 
this matter.
    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you.
    Ms. Stephan, last question. Alvin Bragg's Day One policy 
that took armed robbery from in some cases from a felony to a 
misdemeanor, does that embolden criminal activity?
    Ms. Stephan. I believe that every prosecutor should follow 
the rule of the law, and the law says that robbery is a felony.
    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you.
    I yield back.
    I now recognize the Ranking Member for his line of 
questioning.
    Mr. Magaziner. Well, thank you all very much again for 
being here.
    I want to dive into some of the recommendations that you 
all have presented to the committee, and let's start with the 
coordination centers which several of you referenced and have 
been piloted in different parts around the, places around the 
country.
    I'll open this up to any of you. Can any of you comment on 
the experience of your organizations with coordination centers? 
What's worked? What's not? What are the best practices that we 
should be mindful of as we look to expand this model across the 
country?
    So I don't know. Mr. Glenn, would you like take a crack at 
it?
    Mr. Glenn. We have had conversation with HSI about 
participating with them on the coordination centers, but to 
this point we have not.
    Mr. Magaziner. OK.
    Ms. Stephan. I believe in coordination centers based on our 
experience in San Diego County. We use it for every pressing 
issue. For example, we use it to track school threats very 
successfully where we're able to know exactly whether a threat 
has been resolved and whether we're able to make that school 
safe.
    We use it in elder fraud where we finally are able to track 
that we had $49 million stolen to elder fraud in San Diego in 1 
year.
    So we look forward to having that staple type of effort in 
order to gather accurate data. The best way to come up with 
solutions is to really know the size of the monster that you're 
dealing with.
    Mr. Magaziner. Then, Mr. Glenn, one of the root causes of 
the rise of organized retail theft that you highlighted is the 
availability of easy platforms for resale, particularly on-
line.
    Again, I'll open this up to any of you. What should we as 
Congress be thinking about when it comes to the resale aspects 
of this? Should there be tougher requirements for these on-line 
platforms to know their customers, to know who is selling these 
goods, particularly, you know, large amounts of bulk goods that 
are highly likely to have been procured through retail theft?
    Mr. Glenn. Yes, thank you for the question.
    You know, in a perfect world, long before it's being 
resold, we would not actually experience the loss.
    I think the Informed Consumers Act was a great first step, 
but we also know that there's some opportunities with 
enforcement. We also know there's opportunities with education, 
and we need to continue to kind-of round out the needs and the 
abilities of using the INFORM Act to kind-of help that 
defencing resale opportunity and actually put some teeth into 
it from a prosecution perspective.
    Mr. Magaziner. Does anyone else have a perspective on that?
    Ms. Stephan. The INFORM Act is a great tool, but it needs 
the people with expertise in order to make the cases.
    In the old days we had the pawn shops. So we put together 
that you need to show ID and other things. So everything went 
on-line, and really this is why COVID shutdowns made more 
shoppers go on-line. So this became extremely profitable.
    But we need the FTC and law enforcement to be able to have 
the technology, the tools to work with those platforms in order 
to bring accountability.
    Mr. Magaziner. Thank you.
    So I think we all agree that this is an issue that's worthy 
of our attention in Congress and that we all want to work 
together to try to help you in combatting organized retail 
theft. That's why I am proud to have signed on as a cosponsor 
to Representative Titus and Representative Buck's Combatting 
Organized Retail Theft Act, and I certainly encourage all of my 
colleagues to take a look at the bill and do the same.
    It deals with the aggregation issue and penalties in the 
U.S. code but also gives Homeland Security and DOJ some 
additional tools on the investigative and data sharing side 
that I think are very important, as well.
    But with the last moment that I have here, people are 
watching. Those of you from industry who are leaders in this 
space have adopted some practices at your level, as well, to 
help protect your employees and your customers.
    So I just want to give any of you one last opportunity if 
there are any best practices that you have put into place that 
you would like to highlight that might be useful for others who 
are watching to see, as well.
    Mr. Glenn. Thank you for the question.
    What I would tell you is that our process and our policy at 
the Home Depot is to make our associates understand the risk, 
first and foremost. It's an education process.
    No. 2, provide them with the tools for deescalation, really 
making sure that they understand how to extricate themselves 
from these types of scenarios.
    No. 3, to be great witnesses. Teaching people to be great 
witnesses to what's happening around them can help us then 
close these cases down because we actually bring all this 
information in together into a kind-of a processing database 
for us, and we use that information to work with law 
enforcement.
    Mr. Magaziner. Thank you all.
    I'll yield back.
    Mr. Pfluger. The gentleman yields.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from New York, Mr. 
D'Esposito.
    Mr. D'Esposito. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you all for being here and for the work that you do.
    Madam District Attorney, I'm paraphrasing, but I believe 
when the Chairman asked a question, your response was that a 
district attorney must do everything in their power to uphold 
the law. If someone, for example, is charged with robbery, it 
should be a felony and thus prosecuted as such.
    Obviously, that question came about because of the rogue DA 
that we have in New York City, specifically in Manhattan, and I 
know Mr. Magaziner had just mentioned that when it comes to 
retail theft, we all are trying to work together.
    I would say that many of us are trying to work together, 
but there's actually a Member of this subcommittee who is a 
very big supporter of that rogue DA. Mr. Goldman is a big 
supporter of Mr. Bragg in Manhattan.
    There is no question that we are trying to work together. 
But when we see cities like New York City, a city that I wore 
the uniform in, I was proud NYPD detective for my entire 
career, those cities are suffering because of policies put in 
place by Democrats. That's without question.
    We have in the State of New York the Governor who was a 
Democrat, the State legislature, both the assembly and the 
Senate, Democrat-controlled, put into place criminal justice 
reform, bail reform. At no point at any time did they have any 
conference with people in law enforcement who were actually on 
the street, making sure that they were living out their oath to 
protect and serve. At no point did they have conversations with 
the men and women who wore the uniform, who were wrestling 
illegal firearms from people's hands. Those conversations never 
happened.
    They did it because they believed that they were going to 
reform our criminal justice system. I will say that as someone, 
again, who has spent a career in law enforcement, there are 
reforms needed. But they aren't reforms that needed to be 
painted with a broad brush.
    So I want to thank you for saying what you said and making 
us all realize that when someone is elected district attorney, 
it doesn't give he or she the ability to rewrite in New York's 
case the penal code and get to pick and choose what crimes they 
prosecute.
    This has led in places like New York and not just the city 
but in places like my district in the southwest corner of Long 
Island where you now walk into places like CVS and when you 
walked in with your family and you grabbed that little basket, 
because you didn't want to do a lot of shopping, you just 
wanted to do a little, so you had the basket, no more baskets.
    Why? Because people were taking those baskets, filling them 
up with whatever it is they wanted, and walking right out the 
door?
    Why? Because of the laws that were put in place by the 
other side of the aisle, there was really no repercussions and 
it literally took the handcuffs out of law enforcement's tool 
belt and put the handcuffs on prosecutors.
    So what I'm asking here today is: What can we do? I mean, 
what is it that Members of Congress, what can we do to work 
with local law enforcement agencies besides changing the 
justice reform? What have you seen that has been successful in 
your area that we can do to curtail some of the disasters that 
we're seeing?
    Ms. Stephan. I think what you're doing here by example, 
coming together around smart legislation, which has bipartisan 
support, is a great step.
    But for me in San Diego, whenever I'm fighting battles, I 
emphasize that public safety, the safety of our children, our 
businesses, our communities, small and large, that is not a 
political issue. That's a human issue. That's a human rights 
issue. Nothing will thrive without safety. You take out our 
police, you take out our law enforcement, you take out our 
prosecutors, or you make them for sale to anybody, then you 
take out the safety.
    With that, there is just no going back. You cannot thrive 
as a neighborhood. So I want--I always elevate the voice of the 
victims. There's nothing more powerful than hearing from the 
people affected and being on the ground, because that is just 
avoids all politics and that's how I handle my region.
    Mr. D'Esposito. You've been a district attorney for how 
long?
    Ms. Stephan. This is my second term.
    Mr. D'Esposito. OK.
    Ms. Stephan. So 5 years.
    Mr. D'Esposito. You've obviously been a prosecutor.
    Ms. Stephan. Thirty-three years.
    Mr. D'Esposito. Thirty-three years.
    I would assume that at no point in prepping for a trial or 
anything like that and I, at least in my career in the NYPD, 
one question that is never asked by those when they're 
responding to a 
9-1-1 call is what political party are you from.
    Ms. Stephan. Exactly. No police report ever shows that.
    Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you.
    I had some questions, but my time has run out for Mr. Glenn 
from Home Depot. If we could chat after that, that'd be great.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you.
    The gentleman's time has expired.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. 
Correa.
    Mr. Correa. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank the 
witnesses for being here today.
    Stephan, I just want to say I did a lot of work with the 
California DAs Association when I was in the State legislature.
    So in the few seconds that I have, few minutes, I want to 
ask you, start out. I got a lot of quick questions for you. 
First of all, you, like your approach, this should not be a 
partisan issue. This is about victims. This is about protecting 
our community.
    So first question to you is: Would we be better off funding 
or defunding the FBI, get rid of the FBI?
    Ms. Stephan. Sir, we need excellent institutions and----
    Mr. Correa. Like the FBI.
    Ms. Stephan [continuing]. And in San Diego, we work with 
the FBI.
    Mr. Correa. Thank you very much.
    Then some people in this House that have advocated for 
that.
    Second of all, I want to ask you specifically. In San 
Diego, you're the district attorney in San Diego. I'm very good 
friends with our Orange County DA, Todd Spitzer. So right now 
you said in California $970 is the threshold. Anything below 
that is a misdemeanor? Anything above that is a felony? Is that 
correct?
    Ms. Stephan. Nine hundred fifty dollars, yes.
    Mr. Correa. Nine hundred fifty dollars.
    Ms. Stephan. Yes. No matter how many times.
    Mr. Correa. So it doesn't aggregate. So you go in every day 
and do $949, $949, $949, it's still a misdemeanor.
    Ms. Stephan. That's right, sir.
    Mr. Correa. Has there been any discussions with our 
legislators in California to change that so maybe there's an 
issue of aggregation there that could be taken into 
consideration?
    Ms. Stephan. There have been discussions, but it has to go 
back into a proposition before the voters.
    Mr. Correa. So this was a proposition passed by the 
California voters.
    Ms. Stephan. Yes.
    Mr. Correa. Not the legislature itself.
    Ms. Stephan. That's right, sir.
    Mr. Correa. OK. This is interesting.
    So let's see what we can do when it comes to that issue, 
moving forward.
    Mr. Glenn, you're president of Home Depot. Yes?
    Mr. Glenn. Vice president.
    Mr. Correa. One of my favorite toy stores. One of my 
favorite toy stores.
    Mr. Glenn. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Correa. I noticed the--you put in self-checkout 
counters now. Has that helped or hurt the situation in anyway?
    Mr. Glenn. You know, thank you for question.
    I don't know that there's been any data that ties self-
checkout to organized retail crime. It is certainly something 
that we are keeping an eye on and looking at the data.
    But we don't see--the type of crime that we're talking 
about are these more broad-based, aggressive rollouts of carts 
full of product. It's coming in and breaking open the locking 
containers and just swiping the shelves and running out the 
door with 10, 12 individuals. That's what we see as more the 
organized retail crime in our stores.
    Mr. Correa. Thank you very much.
    Ms. Jagoda, good to see you, ma'am.
    I wanted to--you have said essentially shopping centers and 
the challenges that we have with a lot of these shopping 
centers, your anchor tenants, so to speak, moving out, closing 
down because of the losses in some cases.
    So the question is: Who are the victims here? Who suffers 
when you have a major shopping center losing tenants?
    Ms. Jagoda. Thank you, Congressman, for that question.
    You know, ICSC represents retail facilities of all shapes 
and sizes in all regions of the country, from large enclosed 
malls to grocery-anchored centers to everything in between.
    You're right. We have seen an unusual amount of store 
closures in geographic areas that have experienced high numbers 
of ORC cases. When stores start closing due to the effects of 
ORC, we see loss of jobs. We see loss of State and local sales 
tax generated and loss of property tax generated. Of course, 
it's a blight on the community.
    A single grocery store typically creates $2.4 million in 
annual State and local sales tax and has an average of 133 
jobs. Really if stores--store closings start increasing as a 
result of ORC, not only will sales and property tax collection 
decrease, schools and first responders will be the ones that 
suffer most.
    So in addition to that shopper experience being diminished, 
you're going to see effects on other public services, as well.
    Mr. Correa. So it's not just, you know, not just a loss 
directly to a retailer but really to the whole community in 
terms of tax revenue, the ability to support local services.
    Like you said, you know, in my district right now I see it 
every day, shopping centers losing major tenants. The whole 
area just does not look well, and a challenge is trying to 
bring in retail to support that community.
    But I want to thank you, thank all of you for being here 
today.
    Ms. Stephan, I'd like to have a sidebar with you later on 
and, Mr. Glenn, with you, as well.
    Thank you.
    Mr. Chair, I'm out of time.
    Mr. Pfluger. The gentleman yields back.
    This will be the last Member to question.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. 
Crane.
    Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I'd like to start by introducing a couple of letters into 
the record, one from CHEP and one from Retail Industry Leaders 
Association.
    Mr. Pfluger. Without objection, so ordered.

Re: Hearing on The Rise in Organized Retail Crime and the Threat to 
Public Safety

    Dear Chair Green, Ranking Member Thompson, Chair Pfluger, Ranking 
Member Magaziner, and Members of the Committee: On behalf of CHEP, a 
Brambles company, I write to thank the committee for holding today's 
hearing on the critical issue of organized retail crime. In addition to 
the many important topics discussed during today's hearing, I would 
also like to draw attention to a specific facet of the problem that 
tends to be overlooked--the theft of wood pallets, reusable containers, 
and other supply chain logistic equipment.
    By way of background, CHEP manages the world's largest pool of 
reusable pallets and containers. In the United States, facilitated by a 
sophisticated network of over 400 operating sites, more than 300 
million CHEP pallets enter the supply chain each year transporting 
consumer goods, fresh produce, beverage, retail, and general 
manufacturing products to American households nationwide. CHEP pallets 
feature a proprietary design intended to last up to 10 years and carry 
more than 2,000 pounds of product per pallet. CHEP's pallets are 
painted in the company's industry known, easily identifiable 
trademarked blue color and marked ``Property of CHEP .'' The durability 
of CHEP's pallets promotes the ``share and reuse'' of these platforms 
among multiple participants across the supply chain. Our business model 
offers customers a more cost-efficient, reliable, and sustainable 
alternative to the use of disposable single-use alternatives or 
managing their own shipping equipment system.
    Pallets, reusable containers, and other supply chain logistic 
equipment are essential components in the Nation's supply chain and 
have been designated as critical infrastructure by the Department of 
Homeland Security. These items serve as an invisible backbone to the 
U.S. economy, playing an invaluable role in moving goods and materials 
from one location to another. Without this necessary equipment, growers 
would be unable to move produce from field to table, raw materials 
would fail to reach the factory, and finished consumer goods would be 
missing from store shelves.
    Unfortunately, over the last several years, driven by rising lumber 
prices and supply chain constraints, our products have been stolen in 
increasing numbers and frequency. Once stolen, items may be broken 
down, sold for scrap, sold into the black market or used to facilitate 
other illicit activities. While pallet theft occurs similar to most 
organized retail crime--where stolen pallets are sold through an 
intermediary or ``fence''--organized retail crime operations have also 
utilized stolen pallets to move stolen goods.
    Regardless of how they are used, stolen pallets have left the 
supply chain, undermining the benefits of its reusability and creating 
an additional cost for manufacturers and consumers. Further, stolen 
pallets removed from CHEP's controlled circular operations model are 
not subject to CHEP's rigorous inspection and rehabilitation protocols, 
which guarantee the integrity of CHEP pallets before they reenter the 
supply chain. Without these regular inspections, stolen pallets that 
are resold present a grave risk to unsuspecting buyers and consumers 
that their structural integrity may be compromised.
    In recent years, CHEP has invested substantial resources, including 
twenty-four full-time investigators and hundreds of truck drivers, in 
an effort to educate consumers and recover stolen pallets using its own 
resources. However, we have increasingly found that many individuals 
willingly continue to steal, purchase, and possess CHEP pallets in 
spite of the very obvious nature of their CHEP ownership. In these 
situations, CHEP, like many other stakeholders in the supply chain and 
retail ecosystem, endeavors to partner with law enforcement to assist 
in recovery and prosecution of wrongdoers. While this partnership has 
produced notable successes in some areas of the country, expanding 
these successes will require a better understanding of the threat 
organized retail crime poses to supply chain infrastructure and 
expanded resources that allow for improved coordination between the 
private sector, and State, local, and Federal law enforcement. This 
hearing provides a welcome forum for discussion on how to expand and 
strengthen these partnerships.
    I commend the committee for its commitment to tackling organized 
retail crime. As this significant threat to public safety and our 
nation's supply chain persists, CHEP stands ready to assist in future 
inquiries and hopes that you may consider incorporating efforts to 
combat the theft of pallets, reusable containers, and other supply 
chain logistic equipment in future hearings and committee activities.
    Thank you again for your leadership on this vital issue.
      Sincerely,
                                               Shawn P. Galey,
                              Vice President & Chief Legal Officer.
                                 ______
                                 
          Letter From the Retail Industry Leaders Association
                                 December 12, 2023.

Re: Committee hearing: From Festive Cheer to Retail Fear: Addressing 
        Organized Retail Crime

    Dear Chairman Pfluger and Ranking Member Magaziner: The Retail 
Industry Leaders Association (RILA) appreciates the Subcommittee's 
interest in organized retail crime (ORC) and the need to shine a bright 
light on the criminals and organizations that continually put retail 
employees, customers, and communities at risk. This is an issue that 
deserves constant attention and needs a multifaceted response at the 
local, State, and Federal level.
    RILA is a trade association of the world's largest, most 
innovative, and recognizable retail companies and brands. We convene 
decisionmakers, advocate for the retail industry, and promote 
operational excellence and innovation. Our aim is to elevate a dynamic 
retail industry by transforming the environment in which retailers 
operate. RILA members include more than two hundred retailers, product 
manufacturers, and service suppliers, who together employ over 42 
million Americans and account for $2.7 trillion in annual sales and 
hundreds of thousands of stores, manufacturing facilities, and 
distribution centers domestically and abroad.
    Organized retail crime has been beguiling retailers for decades and 
has become a highly profitable and sophisticated criminal activity. It 
has moved from sidewalks to pawn shops to online marketplaces over the 
past decade. Unfortunately, organized retail crime has become more 
frequent, violent, and retail employees are suffering significant harm, 
including death, while the communities they serve are also 
deteriorating. ORC is not an urban or rural problem, it is not a 
Republican or Democratic problem, it is not an East or West problem, it 
is affecting every State and cities large and small across the Nation.
    Stepping back, according to Loss Prevention Magazine, ORC involves 
the association of two or more persons engaged in illegally obtaining 
retail merchandise in substantial quantities through both theft and 
fraud as part of an unlawful commercial enterprise. The primary 
objective of these professional crime rings is to steal from local 
retail stores for the purpose of turning retail products into financial 
gain, rather than for personal use. Typically coordinated under well-
planned procedures and rules, organized retail crime can operate on a 
local, regional, national, or international scale.
    RILA, its member companies and other interested parties--law 
enforcement, district attorneys, manufacturers, brands, consumer groups 
and community groups--have worked collaboratively over the last 3 years 
to build and layer a strategy to mitigate ORC that includes targeted 
initiatives, legislation, and partnerships to disrupt these dangerous 
criminal enterprises at every level of government.
    In 2020 RILA established the Buy Safe America Coalition (BSAC), 
which represents a diverse group of responsible retailers, consumer 
groups, manufacturers, intellectual property advocates and law 
enforcement officials who support efforts at all levels of government 
to protect consumers and communities from the sale of counterfeit and 
stolen goods. The mission of BSAC is to protect legitimate businesses, 
employees, consumers, and communities against criminals using third-
party marketplaces to sell dangerous, defective, and stolen goods to 
unsuspecting consumers by passing the Integrity, Notification, and 
Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers Act \1\ (The 
INFORM Consumers Act or INFORM). This legislation had broad bipartisan 
support and in December 2022, Congress passed and the president signed 
INFORM putting in place a law requiring online marketplaces to collect 
and verify information about their sellers, suspend sellers that do not 
comply, disclose key information to consumers shopping online and 
giving new enforcement tools to the Federal Government and State law 
enforcement.

    INFORM became effective in June 2023, empowering the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) and State attorneys general to investigate and 
penalize marketplaces and sellers for failing to follow the strict 
verification and collection mandates in the law. It allows the State 
attorneys general and the FTC to fine a marketplace for non-compliance 
up to $50,120.00 per infraction. It will be important for Congress to 
conduct oversight and for the FTC to enforce this important law, to 
ensure consumers are protected from buying stolen, counterfeit, 
altered, damaged and harmful products.
    INFORM was a great first step by Congress to tackle this serious 
problem. It is our hope that Congress will take further action and pass 
the bipartisan, bicameral Combatting Organized Retail Crime Act 
(CORCA)\2\ that creates a centralized organized retail crime task force 
within Homeland Security Investigations. The task force will increase 
coordination among Federal law enforcement agencies--Department of 
Justice, Secret Service, Postal Service, Drug Enforcement along with 
other law enforcement agencies--to investigate and prosecute these 
criminal ORC enterprises.

    The lack of coordination and collaboration among and between 
Federal law enforcement agencies is hindering the capture and 
prosecution of criminal networks targeting local retailers. These 
syndicates are not only harming legitimate businesses and retail 
employees, they are using their ill-gotten profits to fund other 
nefarious criminal activities. According to Association of Certified 
Anti-Money Laundering Specialist (ACAMS)\3\ report Detecting and 
Reporting the Illicit Financial Flows Tied to Organized Theft Groups 
(OTG) and Organized Retail Crime, ORC ``is a low-risk, high-reward 
business line for transnational criminal organizations' portfolios, 
that presents a significant financial and public safety risk.'' The 
report highlights how the ill-gotten profits from ORC are redirected 
and used to fund human trafficking, terrorism, and drug trafficking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ ACAMS Report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    RILA has not only been focused on finding and enacting solutions at 
the Federal level, we have worked at the State and local level too. 
RILA works with our State retail trade association partners who took 
action against organized retail crime by working with State 
legislators, Governors and attorneys general to pass State INFORM 
Consumers Act laws in 13 States--Alabama, Arkansas, California, 
Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, 
Ohio, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania--and just as important retailers and 
the State associations worked to establish and fund organized retail 
crime task forces which are targeted to prosecute criminal networks. 
Right now, 16 States have set up ORC task forces--Arizona, California, 
Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, 
Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington. More 
are expected to be created in the next year.
    As RILA continues to work with lawmakers, we are also creating 
strong partnerships directly with prosecutors, law enforcement, 
community organizations and social services at the local level to 
effectuate change and counter the cycle of illegal activity that harms 
consumers and honest businesses. RILA has found that cooperation, 
collaboration, and information sharing is key to combatting organized 
retail crime, habitual theft, and other disorder in and around retail 
environments. RILA identified the need to create open lines of 
communication with local district attorneys to facilitate learning, 
address persistent challenges and unite in a shared goal of reducing 
retail crime and restoring vibrancy to communities across the country.
    To that end RILA and the National District Attorneys Association 
(NDAA) formed a first-of-its-kind partnership between retailers and 
prosecutors: Combatting Crime for Safer Communities. The partnership 
serves as a conduit for educating prosecutors on the scope and impact 
of ORC and habitual theft, identifying best practices for retailers to 
support prosecutions, and examining emerging criminal schemes and more.
    The success of the RILA/NDAA spawned the National Store Walk Month 
in September 2023. This initiative invited member retailers to host 
local district attorneys in stores to experience first-hand retailers' 
efforts to prevent, deter, and dismantle ORC and other criminal 
activity, foster understanding, exchange insights and work 
synergistically to reduce retail crime. Over 80 DA offices from 26 
States participated in our first wave of store walks.
    Finally, RILA and NDAA are working on a long-term project to build 
on the connections forged between retail and law enforcement to address 
systemic challenges that drive criminal activity called the Vibrant 
Communities Initiatives (VCI). The RILA/NDAA Vibrant Communities 
Initiative arose out of an urgent need to address rising organized 
retail crime, habitual theft, violence, vagrancy, and blight in and 
around retail stores. Communities across America are plagued with 
underlying social challenges--drug addiction, mental illness, 
homelessness--that exacerbate retail crime.
    Collaboration between all community stakeholders is what retailers 
believe will lead to sustainable change. VCI brings together district 
attorneys, police departments, social services organizations, and other 
community leaders to identify effective approaches to deterring theft, 
reducing recidivism, diverting young offenders while also addressing 
the role of addiction, homelessness and mental health's impact on 
criminal activity. RILA and the NDAA kicked-off VCI in two pilot 
communities--Yolo County (CA) and King County (WA). The goal is to find 
universal solutions and best practices that are transferrable to other 
towns and cities across the country to address both the root causes of 
criminal activity and the solutions for deterrence.
    Addressing the myriad root causes of habitual and violent theft is 
key to curbing the trend over the long-term. A comprehensive approach 
requires prosecution for violent offenders and habitual offenders who 
make a living re-selling stolen products; diversion and second chance 
opportunities for young people who make wrong decisions; and thoughtful 
collaboration when it comes to addressing societal issues such as 
homelessness, addiction, and mental health challenges.
    As millions of Americans have undoubtedly seen on the news, retail 
establishments of all kinds have seen a significant uptick in brazen 
retail crime incidents in communities across the Nation. This 
continuing trend has made retail businesses a target for increasing 
theft, harmed legitimate businesses who are forced to compete against 
unscrupulous sellers, and has greatly increased consumer exposure to 
unsafe and dangerous counterfeit products.
    The retail industry is committed to changing the tide on retail 
theft. All reasonable and legitimate solutions are welcomed. We look 
forward to continuing to work with the Chairman, Ranking Member and the 
Members of the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Law Enforcement, and 
Intelligence along with other interested parties within Congress, the 
administration, Federal law enforcement, State legislatures, police 
departments, State attorneys general, and social services to help deter 
retail crime and its negative impact on every community across the 
country.
     Sincerely,
                                           Michael Hanson Sr.,
 Executive Vice President, Public Affairs, Retail Industry Leaders 
                                                       Association.

    Mr. Crane. Thank you.
    I want to start with Mr. Johnston.
    Earlier, sir, you said that your organization has a top ten 
list. Can you go ahead and let us know what those are?
    Mr. Glenn. Thank you for the question, sir.
    I do not have those off the top of my head. I can provide 
those answers to you at a later date.
    Mr. Crane. Do you happen to know any of them, sir, since 
you're testifying here before Congress as the representative?
    Mr. Johnson. Congressman, in no particular order, Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Memphis, Oakland, Chicago, 
Illinois.
    Mr. Crane. Yes, imagine that. Just like the last panel, 
similar trends that we're looking for, pattern recognition.
    What do those have in common, sir?
    I mean, I get it. You guys got to be careful. But if you 
want Congress to help, we got to be honest about these things. 
These are all Democrat-run cities. These are--all of them have 
policy changes.
    Just like Ms. Stephan was talking about, somebody who's 
done this her whole life, who knows that crime doesn't care 
about your political affiliation, it doesn't care about your 
skin color. It affects everybody.
    How about you, Mr. Glenn? You represent Home Depot. When 
these stores go under and they lock their doors and bar up 
their windows and they leave town, does it affect just 
Republicans or White people, or does it affect everybody?
    Mr. Glenn. No, sir, it affects everyone.
    Mr. Crane. Yes, it's pretty sad, isn't it?
    Mr. Glenn. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Crane. It's pretty sad.
    But like a lot of things in this country, unfortunately 
this is another self-inflicted wound. The worst part about it 
is you sit here in these panels, and you talk to the folks 
before you who are all leaders in the FBI, law enforcement. 
They can't even tell what you the trends are. It's no wonder we 
can't solve these problems because we can't even have serious 
conversations anymore.
    Ms. Stephan, did I say that right, ma'am? You said we 
didn't even see the smash-and-grab type events until the law 
changes. Ma'am, when you see these type of, you know, retail 
crimes increase, do you also see other crimes, other violent 
crimes like murder, robbery, et cetera? Do you see those 
increase, as well?
    Ms. Stephan. You know, San Diego's one of the safest urban 
counties in America. So we work very hard on solving crime, 
murders. We have about a hundred murders a year which is one 
too many for me but extremely low for the fifth-largest county 
in the United States.
    So we see trends, but we work together in task forces to 
shut them down to make sure that our community's safe. We just 
don't leave anyone to chance.
    So as we saw these trends in organized retail crime, we 
brought together the task forces. We worked on solving them 
with retailers coming together, putting the images from their 
videos in one room, coming together to solve this issue 
coordinating.
    This is why I was excited about testifying, hoping that 
other regions will follow the example that we are setting, that 
my team I'm proud of is setting.
    Mr. Crane. Yes. Well, I'm not surprised at all, ma'am, that 
you have, that your city has the track record that it does. I 
actually spent a lot of time in San Diego. I was stationed 
there for about a decade. I did, for the most part depending on 
what neighborhood I was in, did feel relatively safe. So thank 
you, ma'am, for what you do.
    I hope that there are other folks in law enforcement and, 
you know, DA's offices all over the country that are watching 
this and can learn from your example, because one thing I can 
tell you is you don't seem too interested in partisan politics. 
You seem interested in justice, protecting the people that 
elected you, appointed you, want you to protect them.
    I appreciate you for doing that. I can't say that about 
every DA, every prosecutor in the country. I think it's 
despicable. I think it's absolutely despicable.
    Just like I questioned the panel before you that we have 
individuals that are pumping millions and millions and millions 
of dollars into prosecutor races and DA races all over the 
country to try and weaken law enforcement in those areas, 
that's despicable. It's disgusting. Americans all over the 
country of all creeds, ethnicities, races, religions are paying 
for it.
    Thank you.
    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Pfluger. The gentleman yields.
    I'd like to thank all of our witnesses on both panels today 
for the valuable testimony and the Members for their questions.
    The Members of the subcommittee may have some additional 
questions for the witnesses, and we would ask the witnesses to 
respond to these in writing.
    Pursuant to committee rule VII(D), the hearing record will 
be held open for 10 days.
    Without objection, the subcommittee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 4:40 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

             Statement of American Beverage Licensees (ABL)
             
                           December 12, 2023
                           
    ABL is a trade association representing the retail tier of the U.S. 
alcohol industry. Its members include thousands of bars, taverns, and 
package liquor stores that sell beer, wine, and spirits in States 
across the country. As an important cog in the hospitality industry 
economic machine, direct retail beverage alcohol sales in the United 
States create more than 2.03 million well-paying jobs and generate over 
$27.9 billion in Federal taxes and $20.0 billion in State and local 
taxes.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ABL thanks the Chairman, Ranking Member, and subcommittee for 
holding this hearing. Over the past few years, instances of organized 
retail crime (ORC) in retail, and in package liquor stores 
specifically, have raised concern among beverage retailers. ORC is 
defined by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) as ``the association 
of two or more persons engaged in illegally obtaining items of value 
from retail establishments, through theft and/or fraud, as part of a 
criminal enterprise.''\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ https://www.ice.gov/features/op-boiling-point.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The National Retail Federation notes that ``Liquor is one of the 
most stolen items in the food and beverage sector. It is one of the 
most common, ahead of baby formula, cheese, meat and coffee . . . high-
end liquor is among the top 10 targets for shoplifters across all 
retailers.'' NRF adds, ``One of the reasons alcohol is one of the most 
popular items stolen is because it's rarely in high-security areas, 
it's expensive, and easy to conceal. It also commands a high resale 
value . . . alcohol theft costs retailers approximately $46.8 billion 
in shrink every year.''\3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ABL continues to hear from its retail members who are worried that 
ORC offenders are increasingly interested in stealing beverage alcohol. 
One ABL board member has been robbed 3 times at his store in 
Memphis,\4\ and the high-profile robberies of liquor stores in 
Philadelphia \5\ earlier this year have elevated the issue in the 
retail alcohol community. Attorneys whose practices encompass beverage 
alcohol laws note that ``there has been a significant uptick in large-
scale (alcohol) larceny in recent months.''\6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Beverage business owners, many of whom operate small, family-owned 
and operated package liquor stores, are being forced to consider 
``hardening'' their retail stores, which necessarily will make them 
less appealing to customers who often look forward to the trip to the 
package liquor store to discover new products or purchase their 
favorite brands. In addition to standard measures including installing 
bollards, metal shutters and camera systems, other options for 
deterring or preventing theft include fogging systems or hiring 
security guards, though in some jurisdictions, those guards are limited 
in what they can do. The fact that they are hired in some instances to 
protect store employees is a depressing commentary on the current 
situation.
    But even hiring security guards has its drawbacks. As one liquor 
store owner from Texas shared, ``It's a sad state of affairs when you 
have to sit back and weigh the cost of hiring outside security versus 
what dollar amount you are losing to theft to see which one is more 
affordable.'' Another mentioned the psychological impact of hiring 
outside security. ``When we do have an altercation . . . or have to 
hire armed guards, the customers in the community hear about it and 
think it's not a safe place to shop. Therefore, we lose even more.''
    Public safety is at the heart of licensed beverage retailers' 
businesses as they are the gatekeepers of age-restricted products and 
keep them out of the hands of those who are under age. The organized 
retail theft of alcohol undercuts the very systems that States have in 
place to create accountability, chains of custody, and proper public 
and private oversight of beer, wine, and spirits so that they are not 
available to minors.
    There is concern across the alcohol industry--including in the 
supplier and wholesaler tiers--that an unaddressed increase in 
organized retail theft of liquor will lead to the transfer of premium 
brands and products from the retail floor to behind counters, into 
glass cases or under lock-and-key, resulting in a loss of incremental 
sales. Retailers might also feel compelled to purchase, stock, and 
store less inventory of products that are strategically targeted by 
criminal enterprises, which subsequently has negative effects on the 
supply chain.
    ABL supports the Combatting Organized Retail Crime Act of 2023 
(H.R. 895; S. 140)\7\ and urges Congress to pass this important 
legislation that expands Federal enforcement of criminal offenses 
related to organized retail crime. ABL also supports the further 
coordination of and engagement of Federal, State, and local law 
enforcement; prosecutors; and retail merchants through task forces and 
other organization.

    Today's hearing is an important step forward. Beverage retailers 
are open to working with their fellow merchants, legislators, 
regulators, law enforcement, and prosecutors to better address 
organized retail crime.
    The following is a sample of recent media reports of incidents that 
have the criteria of being acts of organized retail crime.
  <bullet> CALIFORNIA: Arrested In South OC Target Thefts, Stolen 
        Liquor Recovered (August 10, 2023).--``Four suspects were 
        arrested in Mission Viejo on suspicion of stealing roughly 
        $2,658 in liquor from Target, the Orange County Sheriff's 
        Department reported . . . Deputies found the suspect's vehicle 
        in the surrounding area with two more people inside of it. 
        After conducting a traffic stop, deputies found an additional 
        50 bottles of alcohol valued at $2,658. Three of the four 
        suspects face burglary charges, and four all suspects face 
        conspiracy, organized retail theft, false identification to a 
        peace officer, possession of narcotic paraphernalia and 
        possession of burglary tools charges.''

        investigation (October 23, 2022).--Four Milford businesses were 
        broken into over a span of 4 hours early Friday morning. It's 
        too early in the investigation to determine whether these 
        incidents are related, according to police. KS Mart on 548 
        Naugatuck Ave. was broken into at around 4:38 a.m., followed by 
        Puff City on 874 Boston Post Rd. around 6 a.m. Just 10 minutes 
        after, Voila Wine and Liquor Store on 975 Bridgeport Ave. was 
        broken into. And Fairway Liquor Mart on 597 Bridgeport Ave. was 
        hit around 6:40 am.
  <bullet> GEORGIA: VIDEO.--Surveillance video shows men pry open 
        liquor store door, remove ATM, steal Don Julio tequila (June

        liquor taken from River North store (October 27, 2022).
  <bullet> MARYLAND: Video showcases latest episode of MoCo ``organized 
        retail crime'' (July 21, 2023).--``Police on Thursday released 
        footage of six thieves conducting a burglary July 1 at a liquor 
        store in the White Oak area of Silver Spring. It was the latest 
        episode in Montgomery County of what's been termed `organized 
        retail crime.' Communiques from Montgomery County Police have 
        referenced at least 21 commercial burglaries this year, a trend 
        identified as `organized retail crime.' Since July 13, police 
        have announced arrests in 11 of the thefts.''
  <bullet> MICHIGAN: Detroit man arraigned for alleged $80,000 
        organized retail theft (September 18, 2023).--``A Detroit man 
        was arraigned on organized retail fraud charges for allegedly 
        stealing $80,000 of merchandise from Sam's Clubs in Michigan . 
        . . In April, Michigan State Police and Sam's Club 
        investigators began observing a group entering Sam's Club 
        locations and conducting `push-out' thefts, whereby people push 
        carts loaded with merchandise out the front door without 
        paying. Tansil allegedly stole bottled liquor, electronic 
        equipment and seafood from Sam's Clubs in Auburn Hills, Grand 
        Blanc, Lansing and Ypsilanti and planned to resell the 
        products.''

  <bullet> NEW YORK: 2 people wanted for taking off with $200,000 worth 
        of high-end liquor from Jericho store (October 27, 2023).--
        ``The owner of a Nassau County liquor store says $200,000 worth 
        of high-end bottles of alcohol was taken from his store in a 
        burglary Sunday night, with the suspects returning a second 
        time Monday morning for more . . . The owner said that 
        surveillance video shows those unknown people burglarize his 
        store around 10:15 p.m. and return overnight for hours to take 
        even more items . . . There have been multiple liquor store 
        robberies on Long Island recently. Nassau police confirm 
        they're investigating two separate incidents from earlier in 
        October. At this time, they cannot confirm if any or all of the 
        incidents are related. Detectives say two men broke into the 
        Wine Society liquor store in Greenvale on Oct. 9 and took off 
        with bottles of alcohol . . . Three people broke into Raeder's 
        Wines and Liquors in Albertson on Oct. 10 and took multiple 
        bottles . . . Suffolk police are also investigating a burglary 
        at a Smithtown liquor store. Officers say $25,000 worth of 
        alcohol was taken from the Wine Guy on Oct. 5.
  <bullet> OREGON: Portland liquor store owners ask State for help 
        curbing rise in robberies, thefts (September 25, 2022).--
        ``Burglaries, when someone breaks into the store after hours, 
        are up more than 500 percent since 2018. As for armed 
        robberies, at least four have been reported this year . . . On 
        top of the more threatening crimes, liquor store owners are 
        seeing people brazenly steal multiple bottles at a time. About 
        2 months ago, Hollywood Beverage found that a group of people 
        stole 18 bottles at once . . . Meanwhile, Miner took his 
        concerns to the State last week and asked for some type of 
        financial relief or help in curbing these crimes. The OLCC 
        responded by joining The Oregon Retailer Crime Association to 
        learn more on how to address retail crime . . . This string of 
        theft isn't happening exclusively in liquor stores--it's 
        impacting small businesses across the city.''
  <bullet> PENNSYLVANIA: Over 50 arrested after mobs ransacked 
        Philadelphia stores. Dozens of liquor outlets are shut down 
        (September 27, 2023).--``Dozens of people faced criminal 
        charges Wednesday after authorities said groups of young 
        people, apparently working together, smashed their way into 
        stores in several areas of Philadelphia, stuffing plastic bags 
        with merchandise and fleeing. Police said they made at least 52 
        arrests. Burglary, theft, and other counts have been filed so 
        far against at least 30 people, three of whom are minors, 
        according to Jane Roh, spokesperson for the Philadelphia 
        district attorney's office.
  <bullet> TENNESSEE:
    <bullet> BUSTER'S ROBBED 1st Time--Thieves steal over $10K in 
            alcohol from Memphis liquor store, police say (August 5, 
            2022).--Thieves busted into Buster's liquor store Friday 
            morning, stealing thousands in alcohol. According to the 
            Memphis Police Department (MPD), officers responded to a 
            burglary at Buster's Liquors & Wines, 191 Highland St., 
            just after 3:30 a.m. Several suspects broke into the 
            business and stole over $10k in alcohol, police said. 
            FOX13's cameras captured smashed out window and broken 
            liquor bottles outside the store. VIDEO
    <bullet> BUSTER'S ROBBED 2nd Time--Nearly 10 suspects rob, 
            vandalize Buster's liquor store (June 7, 2023).--Buster's 
            on Highland was broken into and robbed of several items at 
            around 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday. According to the office 
            manager, about 10 vehicles were involved. A truck backed 
            into the business, and 12 people went in and burglarized 
            the store. An employee told WREG the suspects stole several 
            items. ``They went exactly to the Tequila sections that 
            they wanted,'' an employee said. ``They went to the Jack 
            Daniels. They went to the Crown Royale. They went to the 
            Moet. They knew what they were looking for.'' . . . ``The 
            damage is worse than what happened before because there's 
            some structural damage,'' the employee said. ``The last 
            time it was just mostly glass breakage and maybe one 
            shelf.'' The liquor store was burglarized last August. 
            Suspects reportedly stole over $10,000 of liquor, including 
            Hennessey and Don Julio. A $25,000 award was offered to 
            help find those responsible. Memphis police say the stolen 
            alcohol was advertised on Facebook and sold out of a South 
            Memphis apartment. VIDEO
    <bullet> BUSTER'S ROBBED 3rd Time--Buster's liquor store 
            burglarized for 3rd time within a year, one suspect 
            detained (August 17, 2023).--Buster's Liquors & Wines was 
            burglarized Wednesday night, and one of the suspects was 
            detained. Reports say 5 suspects backed a pick-up truck 
            through the glass window of the business. They brought 
            garbage cans on wheels with them to make it easier to steal 
            items. In all, they caused $20,000 worth of damages and 
            stole $5,000 in merchandise . . . Buster's was targeted in 
            June when 10 suspects backed a truck into the business and 
            stole multiple items. Before that, it was hit in August 
            2022. Over $10,000 worth of merchandise was taken and 
            allegedly sold out of a South Memphis apartment. VIDEO
    <bullet> Tips From Public Attributed to Arrests Linked to More Than 
            50 Liquor Store Raids (September 19, 2022).--``A recent 
            `summertime' string of wine and liquor store robberies took 
            place in Memphis, Tennessee. Over 50 businesses were 
            targeted, Local Memphis reported. Recent arrests have been 
            made thanks to tips submitted to Memphis CrimeStoppers. To 
            date, only a handful of arrests have been made with the 
            tips leading to at least a dozen suspects. Rewards of up to 
            $25,000 have been offered--a combination of fundraising by 
            the Memphis Area Liquor Retailers and `the regular 
            CrimeStoppers felony rewards,' Local Memphis stated.
    <bullet> More indicted in retail theft rings, Mulroy says (December 
            12, 2023).--``Another 12 people have been indicted in 
            connection with organized retail theft rings, Shelby County 
            District Attorney Steve Mulroy said Tuesday. That brings 
            the total number of people indicted in Operation Broken 
            Bottles to 27, he said. The operation is targeting smash-
            and-grab theft operations. Smash-and-grab theft rings have 
            hit retail businesses across the city recently. Some, such 
            as City Gear and Buster's Liquors, have been hit multiple 
            times. It's causing some business to consider closing in 
            Memphis, Mulroy said. ``This situation is intolerable and 
            we won't stand for it,'' he said.''
  <bullet> WASHINGTON, DC: DC liquor store owner says she is leaving 
        due to rising crime (October 25, 2023).--``Angela Allred says 
        shoplifting comes with the territory of owning a business, but 
        after 7 years she says the theft is brazen, violent, and more 
        common. `Now people are just running in the store, grabbing it, 
        and then leaving, and as they are leaving, they're actually 
        laughing at us because they know there is nothing we can do,' 
        Allred told WUSA9. Allred says her shop, Imperial Wine and 
        Spirits located on 12th Street NW, is targeted almost daily. 
        She says the most recent incident was Tuesday in broad daylight 
        when a man stole a $50 bottle of rum right in front of her.''



                          A P P E N D I X  I I

                              ----------                              

       Questions From Chairman August Pfluger for Michael J. Krol
       
    Question 1a. Felony thresholds vary from State to State, ranging 
from $200 in New Jersey to $2,500 in my home State of Texas. To 
illustrate the difference, if a criminal were to steal clothing worth 
$250 in New Jersey, they would be charged with a felony. If that same 
criminal were to steal the same items at the same price in Texas, they 
would be charged with a misdemeanor. Some States have increased their 
felony thresholds over the past decade with dire consequences. For 
example, in 2014, the State of California raised its felony threshold 
from $400 to $950. This has led to a surge in criminal activity, often 
in the form of organized retail crime.
    Yes or no, do you believe raising felony thresholds encourages 
criminals to engage in organized retail crime without fear of the 
consequences?
    Answer. Felony thresholds are a matter of State law, and Homeland 
Security Investigations (HSI) does not collect data regarding the 
impact that changes in State law have on criminal activity. Such 
thresholds may be one of many factors weighed by individuals and 
organizations contemplating criminal activity.
    Question 1b. Yes or no, do you believe that the increase in 
organized retail crime has caused U.S. businesses to close and 
endangers the public?
    Answer. Organized retail theft can endanger the public when 
criminals disregard public safety. Public endangerment occurs in 
instances where criminals dangerously flee a retail establishment with 
stolen goods or utilize stolen vehicles to smash through store windows. 
HSI acknowledges that stores have announced their closures following 
incidents of organized retail theft, but HSI does not assess why 
businesses have closed.
    Question 2a. Combating theft and fraud is a never-ending battle as 
retailers try to stay one step ahead of the thieves that prey on their 
business and increase the costs to all of us.
    From what your agencies are seeing, are organized criminal groups 
leveraging emerging technology such as, the expanding on-line 
marketplaces, cryptocurrency, or artificial intelligence to support 
organized retail theft or the fencing and laundering of the proceeds?
    Answer. Yes, HSI has investigated cases in which organized groups 
are using on-line marketplaces to sell stolen goods. In some instances, 
criminals have also exploited vulnerabilities in corporate point-of-
sale systems to facilitate the return of stolen merchandise for cash. 
HSI also has seen organized groups use stolen merchandise for 
international or trade-based money laundering.
    Question 2b. Are you aware of any emerging technologies like facial 
recognition or artificial intelligence that have been developed or 
deployed by retailers or State, local, Tribal, and Territorial law 
enforcement agencies to combat organized retail crime? If so, please 
elaborate in detail.
    Answer. HSI is collaborating with State and local law enforcement 
partners and private-sector retailers to combat organized retail crime 
(ORC); however, we do not have full visibility on all methods being 
utilized to identify ORC suspects.
    Question 2c. Are organized criminal groups using social media to 
recruit individuals to engage in organized retail theft or by using 
social media platforms' on-line marketplaces to fence stolen goods? If 
so, please elaborate in detail.
    Answer. HSI has identified individuals utilizing social media to 
recruit individuals willing to participate in ORC. HSI also has seen 
instances in which social media is used to lure individuals unwittingly 
into large-scale ORC operations.
    Question 3. One of the primary hurdles to successful prosecution of 
organized criminal groups repeatedly targeting retail businesses is the 
difficulty to tie an individual or group to multiple incidents across 
several jurisdictions rather than looking at each incident 
individually, which fails to recognize the toll a group may be taking 
on a particular retailer.
    How is Federal law enforcement assisting State, local, Tribal, and 
Territorial law enforcement agencies and the retail industry with this 
challenge and is there currently coordination and information sharing 
taking place between your Federal agencies to tie these groups 
together?
    Answer. HSI through its National Lead Development Center (NLDC) is 
engaged in close coordination and communication with Federal, State, 
and local law enforcement agencies and retailers on ORC. The NLDC 
intakes ORC leads and looks for patterns, trends, and commonalities to 
link the ORC investigations over multiple districts to coordinate the 
appropriate prosecution.
    Operation Boiling Point is the HSI response to Organized Threat 
Groups (OTGs) profiting from ORC, cargo theft, catalytic converter 
theft, and other theft-related crimes harming the Nation's economy and 
security. The HSI Financial Crimes Unit (FCU) continues to partner with 
CLEAR (Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail), the Retail Industry 
Leaders Association, the National Retail Federation, the Transported 
Asset Protection Association, the Association of Certified Anti-Money 
Laundering Specialists, and several other law enforcement agencies, 
companies, and organizations involved in this effort. The NLDC also 
coordinates with the FCU and loss prevention and asset protection 
representatives from industry on intelligence analysis, lead 
dissemination, and case support for HSI field offices.
    HSI field offices work closely with law enforcement partners to 
combat OTGs in the communities we serve. Many of these investigations 
begin with information sharing between HSI and local law enforcement 
agencies. HSI also provides financial analysis to identify the 
organizations behind the thefts and trafficking of stolen goods. HSI 
has led coordination meetings involving multiple State and local 
jurisdictions investigating the same ORC subjects/groups to share 
information and evidence.
    HSI provides education and outreach about ORC schemes, trends, and 
applicable laws to Federal, State, and local law enforcement partners, 
as well as private-sector retail partners. HSI Detroit, for example, 
has partnered with members of the retail industry and local law 
enforcement to investigate ORC, and participates in a working group 
comprised of Federal, State, and local law enforcement in southeast 
Michigan to combat overseas theft groups. Intelligence information is 
shared within the working group, as well as through local intelligence 
distributions. After committing these thefts, criminal actors may move 
to other States, eluding State or local prosecution. As a result, HSI 
Kansas City has initiated collaborations with local and State entities, 
including State Attorneys General, to enhance the tracking and 
prosecution of ORC activities.
    In July 2023, retail partners and members of Federal, State, and 
local law enforcement gathered at HSI New Orleans to announce an 
Organized Retail Crime Alliance (ORCA) for the 4-State region of 
Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama (LAMA). HSI New Orleans, 
which oversees HSI operations in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi, 
has been leading the LAMA ORCA to foster multi-jurisdictional 
collaboration to identify, disrupt, deter, and dismantle the criminal 
organizations that seek to exploit the retail industry. The partnership 
promotes increased communication and collaboration between law 
enforcement and the retail sector, including use of a common 
information-sharing platform. Additional information regarding the LAMA 
ORCA is available via: https://www.laretail.org/lama-orca.
    Separately, in 2023, HSI New Orleans established an additional team 
called the Organized Retail Crime Task Force (ORCTF) to assist with the 
information being received from LAMA ORCA. The HSI New Orleans multi-
State ORCTF is comprised of Federal, State, and local law enforcement 
officers, who collaboratively target the most egregious organized theft 
groups. Specifically, the LAMA ORCA enables retailers to nominate 
significant theft groups, referred to as Priority Regional Theft Groups 
(PRTGs), for focused attention. Subsequently, the PRTGs are designated 
by law enforcement because the retailers are the victims possessing 
substantial data and intelligence to illuminate the groups, which in 
turn, informs the decisions of law enforcement and their designation 
for PRTGs.
    Question 4. When we discuss organized retail crime and the 
individuals or groups of individuals who are committing large-scale 
theft, it is often unclear who we're referring to exactly. There are 
reports suggesting these individuals are supported and operating at the 
behest of Mexican cartels, Russian crime syndicates, or other 
transnational criminal organizations. We have also seen reporting 
suggesting some of these criminals participating in organized retail 
crime are tied to terrorist groups.
    Please clarify which Transnational Criminal Organizations, or 
criminal groups represent the foremost threat in this space? Is it 
cartels, sophisticated gangs, or foreign crime syndicates? Or, is it 
more loosely affiliated groups of individuals that get together and 
steal merchandise? Please provide a detailed description and list.
    Answer. HSI, through its on-going investigations of ORC, has seen 
the involvement of various transnational criminal organizations to 
include South American theft groups, Romanian and Russian organized 
crime, Mexican cartels, street gangs, and an array of domestic criminal 
groups. For these criminal organizations, ORC can be an additional 
revenue stream to bolster their criminal enterprises. In addition to 
more sophisticated criminal organizations, HSI has also seen loosely-
affiliated groups of individuals commit organized retail crime.
    HSI respectfully defers more detailed information to the 
appropriate setting, to protect on-going investigations.
    Question 5a. The Committee on Homeland Security received a letter 
from CHEP, a Brambles company, that works with reusable pallets and 
containers. The December 12, 2023 letter, which was entered into the 
record, noted concerns from the supply chain logistics sector about the 
theft by criminal organizations of their equipment, including wood 
pallets, plastic shipping crates, or shipping containers--which are key 
components in our country's supply chain and have been designated 
critical infrastructure by the Department of Homeland Security.
    Yes or no, is this a dilemma that HSI, the FBI, and/or the Secret 
have identified, and committing resources to combat? If so, please 
explain.
    Answer. Yes, HSI is working to combat threats to the supply chain 
logistics sector. ORC organizations need pallets and containers to move 
large quantities of stolen merchandise. HSI has received reports about 
stolen pallets, intermodal containers, intermodal container chassis, 
and empty cargo trailers, which can disrupt operations.
    Question 5b. In an effort to tackle this problem, what additional 
resources or authorities are needed by Federal law enforcement agencies 
and prosecutors, if any?
    Answer. Existing HSI authorities provide the necessary framework to 
combat ORC. Should additional resources be provided, they could be 
directed to expand on-going efforts. Successful investigations and 
prosecutions require resources for investigators, analysts, and 
prosecutors, as well as training and coordination.
    Question 5c. How exactly is Federal law enforcement assisting 
State, local, Tribal, and Territorial law enforcement agencies and the 
private-sector industry with this challenge and is there currently 
coordination and information sharing taking place between your Federal 
agencies and law enforcement partners to probe and prevent such crimes?
    Answer. HSI, through Operation Boiling Point and the NLDC, is 
assisting Federal, State, local, Tribal, and retail partners on suspect 
identification, lead development, financial analysis, and prosecutorial 
coordination. HSI field offices work closely with law enforcement 
partners to combat OTGs in the communities we serve. HSI provides 
investigative assistance, including financial analysis, surveillance, 
and cell phone record exploitation to identify the organizations behind 
the thefts and trafficking of stolen goods. Many HSI field offices 
partner with local task forces to combat ORC.
    For example, HSI Kansas City has been proactive in forging and 
strengthening robust relationships with State and local partners, as 
well as with the State's Attorney General's offices, while continuously 
striving to enhance these vital partnerships. In Florida, the HSI Miami 
El Dorado Taskforce and South Florida Retail Crimes Group are working 
with State and local agencies to investigate and prosecute these 
crimes. Together law enforcement is partnering with retail victims, 
loss prevention investigators, and managers. HSI Miami has full-time 
local taskforce officers assigned to specific groups to combat these 
crimes.
    In July 2023, HSI New Orleans, retail partners and members of 
Federal, State, and local law enforcement formed the LAMA ORCA to 
foster multi-jurisdictional collaboration to identify, disrupt, deter, 
and dismantle the criminal organizations that seek to exploit the 
retail industry and threaten our Nation's financial security. This 
public-private partnership promotes increased communication and 
collaboration between law enforcement and the retail sector partners 
both in person via recurring information-sharing meetings and on-line 
via the use of a common information-sharing platform. HSI New Orleans 
further established a multi-State ORC task force, comprised of Federal, 
State, and local law enforcement officers, to collaboratively target 
the most egregious multi-jurisdictional violators as identified through 
the LAMA ORCA information-sharing process. The HSI ORC task forces 
empower State and local law enforcement to conduct large, complex 
Federal investigations in collaboration with HSI Special Agents and to 
refer such cases for Federal prosecution.
    Question 6. Organized retail crime has become a significant threat 
to public safety across the country. Many Americans have seen the 
dramatic video footage of smash-and-grab attempts at retailers, such as 
Nike, Nordstrom's, or Macy's. In addition, organized retail crime and 
large-scale theft is taking place at smaller businesses in rural areas. 
State, local, Tribal, and Territorial law enforcement entities and our 
Nation's retail industry must have support from Congress and the 
Federal Government to address this growing threat.
    What concrete actions may Congress offer the most help to ensure 
that Federal law enforcement agencies are properly equipped to assist 
State, local, Tribal, and Territorial law enforcement entities?
    Answer. One of the biggest hurdles in ORC investigations is 
identifying the individuals involved in the theft. The most important 
step Congress can take is to fully fund the fiscal year 2025 DHS Budget 
Request, which includes requests for resources across HSI's 
programmatic areas that will enable HSI and its partners to combat ORC. 
HSI also appreciates efforts by Congress to bring awareness of this 
issue, and foster collaboration between ICE and other stakeholders in 
State, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement, as well as the 
business community. HSI is committed to ensuring every law enforcement 
agency--regardless of size, funding, or resources--has HSI's support to 
carry out the work that is essential to securing the supply chains our 
economy relies on and the safety of the American public. HSI stands 
ready to engage with Members of Congress to educate and partner with 
local stakeholders to better counter ORC.
    Question 7. Yes, or no, do you believe that ORC has been 
exaggerated and not a serious challenge? Please explain.
    Answer. HSI is taking the threat of ORC seriously and working with 
State, local, Tribal, and Territorial partners across the country, as 
described above, to combat ORC and ensure the safety of the American 
public.
    Question 8. Yes or no, do you believe that ORC is nonviolent? 
Please explain.
    Answer. ORC crimes have the potential to become violent. Through 
our ORC investigations, HSI has observed incidents wherein ORC 
violators engaged in violent behavior.
    Question 9. In HSI's efforts to combat ORC, has your agency ever 
encountered examples of a connection between groups engaged in ORC and 
human trafficking? If so, can you describe those connections and 
identify any specific groups associated with these crimes?
    Answer. HSI has no information at this time regarding a connection 
between groups engaged in organized retail crime and human trafficking.

        Questions From Chairman August Pfluger for Jason D. Kane
        
    Question 1a. Felony thresholds vary from State to State, ranging 
from $200 in New Jersey to $2,500 in my home State of Texas. To 
illustrate the difference, if a criminal were to steal clothing worth 
$250 in New Jersey, they would be charged with a felony. If that same 
criminal were to steal the same items at the same price in Texas, they 
would be charged with a misdemeanor. Some States have increased their 
felony thresholds over the past decade with dire consequences. For 
example, in 2014, the State of California raised its felony threshold 
from $400 to $950. This has led to a surge in criminal activity, often 
in the form of organized retail crime.
    Yes or no, do you believe raising felony thresholds encourages 
criminals to engage in organized retail crime without fear of the 
consequences?
    Answer. Felony thresholds are a matter of State law, and Homeland 
Security Investigations (HSI) does not collect data regarding the 
impact that changes in State law have on criminal activity. Such 
thresholds may be one of many factors weighed by individuals and 
organizations contemplating criminal activity.
    Question 1b. Yes or no, do you believe that the increase in 
organized retail crime has caused U.S. businesses to close and 
endangers the public?
    Answer. Organized retail theft can endanger the public when 
criminals disregard public safety. Public endangerment occurs in 
instances where criminals dangerously flee a retail establishment with 
stolen goods or utilize stolen vehicles to smash through store windows. 
HSI acknowledges that stores have announced their closures following 
incidents of organized retail theft, but HSI does not assess why 
businesses have closed.
    Question 2a. Combating theft and fraud is a never-ending battle as 
retailers try to stay one step ahead of the thieves that prey on their 
business and increase the costs to all of us.
    From what your agencies are seeing, are organized criminal groups 
leveraging emerging technology such as, the expanding on-line 
marketplaces, cryptocurrency, or artificial intelligence to support 
organized retail theft or the fencing and laundering of the proceeds?
    Answer. Yes, HSI has investigated cases in which organized groups 
are using on-line marketplaces to sell stolen goods. In some instances, 
criminals have also exploited vulnerabilities in corporate point-of-
sale systems to facilitate the return of stolen merchandise for cash. 
HSI also has seen organized groups use stolen merchandise for 
international or trade-based money laundering.
    Question 2b. Are you aware of any emerging technologies like facial 
recognition or artificial intelligence that have been developed or 
deployed by retailers or State, local, Tribal, and Territorial law 
enforcement agencies to combat organized retail crime? If so, please 
elaborate in detail.
    Answer. HSI is collaborating with State and local law enforcement 
partners and private-sector retailers to combat organized retail crime 
(ORC); however, we do not have full visibility on all methods being 
utilized to identify ORC suspects.
    Question 2c. Are organized criminal groups using social media to 
recruit individuals to engage in organized retail theft or by using 
social media platforms' on-line marketplaces to fence stolen goods? If 
so, please elaborate in detail.
    Answer. HSI has identified individuals utilizing social media to 
recruit individuals willing to participate in ORC. HSI also has seen 
instances in which social media is used to lure individuals unwittingly 
into large-scale ORC operations.
    Question 3. One of the primary hurdles to successful prosecution of 
organized criminal groups repeatedly targeting retail businesses is the 
difficulty to tie an individual or group to multiple incidents across 
several jurisdictions rather than looking at each incident 
individually, which fails to recognize the toll a group may be taking 
on a particular retailer.
    How is Federal law enforcement assisting State, local, Tribal, and 
Territorial law enforcement agencies and the retail industry with this 
challenge and is there currently coordination and information sharing 
taking place between your Federal agencies to tie these groups 
together?
    Answer. HSI through its National Lead Development Center (NLDC) is 
engaged in close coordination and communication with Federal, State, 
and local law enforcement agencies and retailers on ORC. The NLDC 
intakes ORC leads and looks for patterns, trends, and commonalities to 
link the ORC investigations over multiple districts to coordinate the 
appropriate prosecution.
    Operation Boiling Point is the HSI response to Organized Threat 
Groups (OTGs) profiting from ORC, cargo theft, catalytic converter 
theft, and other theft-related crimes harming the Nation's economy and 
security. The HSI Financial Crimes Unit (FCU) continues to partner with 
CLEAR (Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail), the Retail Industry 
Leaders Association, the National Retail Federation, the Transported 
Asset Protection Association, the Association of Certified Anti-Money 
Laundering Specialists, and several other law enforcement agencies, 
companies, and organizations involved in this effort. The NLDC also 
coordinates with the FCU and loss prevention and asset protection 
representatives from industry on intelligence analysis, lead 
dissemination, and case support for HSI field offices.

violators engaged in violent behavior.
    Question 9. A recent Better Business Bureau study highlighted the 
growing threat of gift card scams to retailers, citing a 50 percent 
increase in these scams reported over the previous year. In many of 
these cases, criminals, often overseas, persuade Americans to purchase 
gift cards by impersonating service providers, government agencies, or 
sweepstakes officials, amongst others. Once the victim provides the 
gift card information, the fraudster can use the funds on-line or 
purchase additional gift cards to obscure where the funds came from. 
Many retailers are becoming more engaged in helping to protect and 
assist victims of gift card fraud.
    As one example, Walmart recently teamed up with the Secret Service 
to intercept fraudulently-obtained gift card funds and redirect them 
into an escrow account, which once confirmed as fraud, can be used to 
repay victims. Walmart reported earlier this year that the partnership 
led to the return of almost $4 million back to victims.
    Please explain how the Secret Service is able to partner with 
retailers like Walmart to return stolen funds back to victims and if we 
can expect to see more partnerships like this developing across the 
retail industry.

private-sector industry with this challenge and is there currently 
coordination and information sharing taking place between your Federal 
agencies and law enforcement partners to probe and prevent such crimes?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 6. Organized retail crime has become a significant threat 
to public safety across the country. Many Americans have seen the 
dramatic video footage of smash-and-grab attempts at retailers, such as 
Nike, Nordstrom's, or Macy's. In addition, organized retail crime and 
large-scale theft is taking place at smaller businesses in rural areas. 
State, local, Tribal, and Territorial law enforcement entities and our 
Nation's retail industry must have support from Congress and the 
Federal Government to address this growing threat.
    What concrete actions may Congress offer the most help to ensure 
that Federal law enforcement agencies are properly equipped to assist 
State, local, Tribal, and Territorial law enforcement entities?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 7. Yes, or no, do you believe that ORC has been 
exaggerated and not a serious challenge? Please explain.
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 8. Yes or no, do you believe that ORC is nonviolent? 
Please explain.
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 9. In your written testimony, you mentioned that the 
proceeds from ORC could fund other illicit activities. Please elaborate 
on your testimony and provide concrete examples of other crimes 
subsidized by ORC and the perpetrators engaged in them.
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    
       Questions From Chairman August Pfluger for David Johnston
       
    Question 1a. We have heard from several retail industry businesses 
and representative organizations and there does not seem to be a 
universally-accepted definition of organized retail crime.
    Do you consider credit card and gift card fraud as well as skimming 
attacks, credit card payment processing system hacks, and even 
ransomware attacks as a part of organized retail crime that are 
increasing costs for retailers?
    Answer. At present, there is no universally-accepted definition for 
organized retail crime (ORC). The National Retail Federation defines it 
as theft or fraud activities conducted with the intent to convert 
illegally-obtained merchandise, cargo, cash, or cash equivalents into 
personal financial gain. It also must involve theft or fraud of 
multiple quantities, conducted in concert by two or more people. ORC 
typically involves multiple occurrences and may occur across several 
stores and jurisdictions.
    Organized retail crime frequently involves orchestrated efforts by 
criminal enterprises to steal merchandise or monies from retailers on a 
large scale. These enterprises or groups use others to commit crimes 
involving the physical retail location, across the supply chain or 
throughout a retailer's digital or ecommerce environment. These crimes 
may not be known initially to be associated with organized retail crime 
until further investigation occurs. The stolen goods or monies are then 
resold through various channels, including on-line marketplaces, 
ecommerce and other websites, peer-to-peer marketplaces, flea markets, 
pawn shops, back into the legitimate supply chain, and even at 
legitimate retail establishments.
    Organized retail crime (ORC) can consist of any crime against 
retail where the stolen goods or monies are meant to support a criminal 
enterprise or structure that directs or supports the resale of those 
stolen goods or monies back into the retail marketplace for profit 
through their illicit activities.
    ORC-related crimes can be conducted against retail store locations, 
across supply chains, and in the cyber, digital, and ecommerce 
environments of a retail entity. Credit card and gift card fraud along 
with cyber crimes that include skimming and ransomware can be 
considered ORC-related crimes if the victim(s) are retailers or the 
retail customer, the crimes are committed to support a criminal 
enterprise or structured organization, and the goods or monies received 
from those crimes are to support the illicit resale of those goods or 
monies for profit.
    For example, ransomware or credit card skimming can be crimes 
conducted against a retail environment by a cyber criminal or cyber 
crime organization that obtains the personal and credit card 
information of hundreds or thousands of individual customers. That 
information can be obtained by an ORC group or sold via the dark web to 
an ORC group, which uses the data to illicitly purchase large 
quantities of merchandise or gift cards on-line from various retailers. 
The merchandise or gift cards received are then re-sold on-line by the 
criminals back to consumers or sold to distributors that resell it back 
into the marketplace. As the stolen goods and monies make their way 
back into our commerce, the ORC group obtains the proceeds of those 
goods or monies sold or re-distributed.
    This exact example was a scenario occurring to a national brand 
retailer, where a group of criminals used compromised credit card 
accounts, buying product on-line and picking merchandise up in store, 
resulting in financial chargebacks over $430,000, and a loss of 
merchandise. This single group committed crimes across several States, 
including CA, IL, KY, OH, PA, and TX, with an expectation that they may 
be based in Michigan. The investigations are still on-going. One of the 
biggest challenges facing the investigation is the coordination and 
support of various law enforcement agencies across multiple 
jurisdictions.
    Question 1b. How damaging are these types of fraud schemes versus 
the physical theft of product that has garnered so much attention 
lately?
    Answer. On-line frauds and cyber crimes can result in a faster and 
higher rate of loss. Cyber criminals or fraudsters often take advantage 
of technology to accelerate their crimes and have more anonymity in the 
cyber environment.
    To our knowledge there has not been a comparison to determine the 
level of damage or loss retailers experience between the physical theft 
of product versus on-line or digital-related fraud schemes. Individual 
reports have been published, but we are not aware of a collective or 
comparison report.
    Question 1c. Are these frauds also increasing year over year as 
dramatically as the attacks on physical inventory?
    Answer. Due to not having any specific comparison, we cannot 
compare these frauds directly to physical thefts, but anecdotally the 
retail industry does see constant and increasing fraud, as they do 
physical theft and in-store criminal activity.
    The following report links from both the FBI and the FTC provide 
the impact of various internet- and consumer-related frauds. We provide 
these reports as examples of personal or consumer-related complaints of 
stolen information, frauds and schemes, and criminal activities that 
often result in the eventual acquisition of stolen merchandise or 
monies from the retail industry.

    Question 2a. A recent report released by Mayor Adams of New York 
highlights that organized retail criminals exploit New York law by 
stealing less than $1,000 of merchandise, thereby avoiding a felony 
charge. California has a similar statute that categorizes theft of less 
than $950 as a misdemeanor.
    Is this practice of stealing less than $1,000 worth of merchandise 
common, and what other practices and tools do these criminals utilize 
to commit crimes, avoid detection, and evade prosecution?
    Question 2b. Several States have recently passed laws aimed at 
increasing penalties on so-called ``boosters,'' the lower-level 
criminals who repeatedly shoplift, in the hope that this will 
eventually lead to the identification of organized crime kingpins. How 
effective have these measures proven thus far?
    Answer. (See response below--duplicate question.)
    Retail asset protection teams and/or law enforcement investigations 
have shown evidence that retail theft criminals are familiar with laws, 
felony threshold levels, retail security measures, and even law 
enforcement capabilities. This awareness does afford the criminals with 
knowledge to steal below felony thresholds, choose specific retail 
locations, target unprotected merchandise, and even identify what tools 
are needed to steal protected merchandise.
    Felony threshold laws vary from State to State, ranging across the 
Nation from $200 to $2,500. For many States, these thresholds serve as 
limits to what retail thieves will steal at a given time. These 
criminals realize that remaining below these thresholds limits the 
seriousness of the crime and its subsequent consequences. Retailers 
believe laws that include aggregation of incidents or total theft value 
over a period of time help address the practice of individual thefts 
below the felony threshold, and therefore aid in reducing overall 
retail theft.
    Evidence of tools, methods, and practices are seen more regularly 
in today's retail theft environment. Organized and/or professional 
criminals use tools as simple as hammers and crowbars to smash locked 
cabinets or cases, to more sophisticated ``booster skirts'' or ``foiled 
lined theft bags'' to conceal and counter anti-theft measures, to 
medical masks and hooded clothing to conceal physical appearance and 
reduce video surveillance or witness detection. False identifications 
are used in refund schemes, fraudulent purchases, or to make arrest 
history or immigration status difficult.
    Many of these tools, methods, and practices are highlighted on the 
Operation Boiling Point website, provided by DHS Homeland Security 
Investigations, including those used by transnational and highly 
sophisticated international theft groups.
    Question 3. Several States have recently passed laws aimed at 
increasing penalties on so-called ``boosters,'' the lower-level 
criminals who repeatedly shoplift, in the hope that this will 
eventually lead to the identification of organized crime kingpins.
    In your view, how effective have these measures proven thus far?
    Answer. Several States have passed laws specifically focused on 
organized retail criminal networks, aggregation of theft or increasing 
penalties involving retail crimes that involve the use of specific 
tools, tactics, or threats. The focus of these laws is the repeat 
offender or those stealing for the sole purpose of reselling the stolen 
merchandise to another source (person, business, organization) that 
will resell the stolen goods.
    At present, it remains too early to determine the overall 
effectiveness of these laws. Several States have recently passed laws 
and/or established task forces to investigate and prosecute using these 
new laws.
    Without specific data, I can state through retailer conversations, 
news media, and learnings from law enforcement agencies, the number of 
apprehensions and prosecutions of those above the ``booster'' appears 
to be increasing. This may be an early indicator that these types of 
laws are having a positive effect, but only time will tell.
    An ORC investigation is a process, one that often takes months to 
years to detect and identify those leading or the ``kingpins'' of a 
network or group. Often involving interstate or transnational activity, 
investigations may be more challenging, especially to local or State 
law enforcement agencies.
    Question 4. Yes, or no, do you believe that ORC has been 
exaggerated and not a serious challenge? Please explain.
    Answer. No. Organized retail crime is not being exaggerated and 
continues to be a serious and growing challenge to the retail industry; 
our workers, consumers, and communities; and the larger U.S. economy. 
Having more than three decades of experience in retail asset 
protection, investigations, and global security, what I see happening 
today is unprecedented.
    Most retail crimes including shoplifting, burglary, and credit card 
fraud are not new. Even professional shoplifting (a former term for 
organized retail crime) is not new. What is different is the ease of 
criminals to network, organize, and establish the means of reselling 
merchandise or monies stolen from the retail ecosystem. Technology has 
afforded greater opportunities to organize and communicate. On-line 
marketplaces have provided opportunities for organized theft groups to 
resell stolen merchandise to a wider audience. Even consumers seeking 
lower prices for products have increased the demand for stolen 
merchandise, which can be resold at lower prices.
    My professional opinion is that the crimes that occur in our retail 
supply chain, retail stores, and on-line retail environments will 
continue to rise until efforts increase to detect, disrupt, and 
dismantle the organized retail crime networks creating the demand for 
these crimes. ORC networks orchestrate, influence, and create demand 
for those committing theft and fraud in our retail environments. 
Shoplifting, cargo theft, burglaries, smash-and-grabs, and various 
frauds are just a means to their end. Varying in scope and scale, these 
networks range from loosely-organized, local and regional groups to 
highly-sophisticated hierarchies operating at a transnational level.
    These criminal groups thrive on enabling others to commit their 
crimes. They prey on the homeless, the addicted, and even the victims 
of human trafficking. They profit from the reselling of stolen goods 
on-line, re-channeling and re-distributing goods back into our 
marketplace and the transportation of stolen goods and proceeds beyond 
our border. What's most important that many fail to recognize is that 
these groups use ORC as a gateway crime, with profits funding more 
nefarious activities including drugs, weapons, and human trafficking. 
These groups must be the focus of our local, State, and Federal 
efforts.
    Question 5. Yes or no, do you believe that ORC is nonviolent? 
Please explain.
    Answer. No. Violence continues to occur at increased levels with 
those criminal activities involving or associated with organized retail 
crime. ORC is not a victimless crime.
    Retail asset protection professionals inform me repeatedly of the 
increase in threats, assaults, and acts of violence against their 
employees, security officers, and customers. Several reported that the 
number of acts of threat or violence reached upwards of 75 percent year 
over year prior to the holiday season. One retailer reported to me a 
statistic that, across their organization, employees had to disengage 
from 77 percent of shoplifting apprehensions due to the threat of 
violence--up from 64 percent of apprehension incidents the year prior.
    Our 2023 National Retail Security Survey, representing 177 retail 
brands, found that 88 percent of asset protection leadership stated 
shoplifters are more or much more aggressive and violent compared with 
1 year ago; 66 percent stated that those determined to be involved in 
ORC-related shoplifting were more aggressive and violent than the 
previous year.
    Violence in the retail store is of serious concern. Beyond the loss 
of product, retail CEOs, executives and asset protection professionals 
view the safety of retail workers and customers to be a priority. The 
violence is due to those stealing products, knowing that the product 
can be resold through an ORC group or effort. Retailers continue to 
speak of incidents involving the use of weapons like mace, bear spray, 
knives, and guns. Some of these criminals have set fires in stores to 
create a distraction. Extremely concerning is the depressing fact that 
several retail workers have been killed during recent theft incidents--
including trained security personnel as well as retail workers serving 
in customer-facing roles.
    The violence, and threat of violence, in the retail environment 
impacts a retailer's ability to hire and retain labor. The threat of 
violence impacts employee morale, causes undue stress, and impacts 
employee and customer trust in the retail industry. Retailers have 
increased violence prevention training, mental health support, and 
security presence to keep their employees safe.

       Questions From Chairman August Pfluger for Summer Stephan
       
    Question 1a. We have heard from several retail industry businesses 
and representative organizations and there does not seem to be a 
universally-accepted definition of organized retail crime.
    Do you consider credit card and gift card fraud as well as skimming 
attacks, credit card payment processing system hacks, and even 
ransomware attacks as a part of organized retail crime that are 
increasing costs for retailers?
    Answer. The laws governing organized retail crime do not commonly 
include credit card and gift card fraud and other crime schemes. 
However, these types of fraud schemes contribute to the overall harm 
that retailers small and large are inflicted with.
    Question 1b. How damaging are these types of fraud schemes versus 
the physical theft of product that has garnered so much attention 
lately?
    Answer. The variety of fraud schemes have a tremendous negative 
impact on retailers, yet they generally do not produce the same 
physical threat and fear to employees and customers as the ``smash-and-
grabs'' that they experience.
    Question 1c. Are these frauds also increasing year over year as 
dramatically as the attacks on physical inventory?
    Answer. We continue to see cases related to the use of stolen 
credit cards and the use of skimmers in San Diego County. Unlike credit 
card fraud and cyber intrusions, the attacks on physical inventory 
result in a traumatic emotional impact on those retail employees and 
consumers that are present during the thefts/robberies, and they 
produce a ripple effect in the community at large. Many times, these 
witnesses/victims sustain fear and concern for their physical safety 
and well-being that can be on-going. Each type of crime requires 
appropriate laws, investigative strategies, resources, and prosecution, 
along with stakeholder education and prevention to effectively reduce 
it.
    Question 2a. A recent report released by Mayor Adams of New York 
highlights that organized retail criminals exploit New York law by 
stealing less than $1,000 of merchandise, thereby avoiding a felony 
charge. California has a similar statute that categorizes theft of less 
than $950 as a misdemeanor.
    Is this practice of stealing less than $1,000 worth of merchandise 
common, and what other practices and tools do these criminals utilize 
to commit crimes, avoid detection, and evade prosecution?
    Answer. In San Diego County, retail theft under $950 is a common 
crime. In 2014, California increased the felony theft threshold to $950 
and eliminated increased punishment for repeat, habitual stealing of 
under $950. We have received reports over the years where bad actors 
willingly admitted to law enforcement that they know nothing will 
happen to them because the theft is only a misdemeanor. We have seen 
cases where individuals steal from different stores on different days 
allowing them to stay under the $950 threshold each time.
    We have seen numerous methods used to commit these thefts and avoid 
detection:
  <bullet> Criminals use tactics to distract store personnel to hide 
        thefts.
  <bullet> Others have been known to brazenly go to one part of the 
        store--take a bolt cutter for sale in the store (as one 
        example) and use it to cut off a lock on a display case to then 
        steal the contents in the case.
  <bullet> Some use bags lined with aluminum to defeat the exit 
        sensors.
  <bullet> It is common for criminals to simply push carts full of 
        store items out the door with employees looking on with 
        desperation. Employees tell us that they feel trapped between 
        store rules created for their safety that require them to not 
        interfere and their own sense of despair over the wrong they 
        are witnessing and the feeling that the losses reduce their 
        chances of getting better pay for their hard work and 
        contribute to store closures that can cost them their 
        livelihood.
  <bullet> Some enter stores with receipts from an earlier purchased 
        item, grab a new item from inside the store and then take the 
        new item to the return counter to get paid the value of the now 
        stolen (new) item.
  <bullet> Some hide higher-priced items within boxes for lower priced 
        items to secrete the higher priced items out of the store--
        paying only for the lower-priced box item.
  <bullet> Some rush in quickly in numbers and take multiple high-
        priced items to overwhelm any potential security.
  <bullet> Some conceal identity by using stolen cars, rental cars, or 
        cars with covered license plates to hide their identity from 
        license plate readers as they drive away from the crime.
  <bullet> Some use COVID masks or other face coverings which makes 
        identification difficult.
    Question 2b. Several States have recently passed laws aimed at 
increasing penalties on so-called ``boosters,'' the lower-level 
criminals who repeatedly shoplift, in the hope that this will 
eventually lead to the identification of organized crime kingpins. How 
effective have these measures proven thus far?
    Answer. California has not had success passing new effective laws 
to deal with the habitual offenders ``boosters'' that steal under the 
felony threshold amount. Recently, the legislature codified existing 
law that permitted aggregation in very limited situations where 
multiple acts of theft are committed against the same owner pursuant to 
one intention, one general impulse, and one plan. Because this is high 
bar for prosecutors, its application has been very limited and may face 
legal challenges if it doesn't comport with the intent of proposition 
47.
    Our office's specialized organized retail crime team investigates 
the cases using multiple avenues of evidence including cell phone, 
social media, and video evidence to uncover the higher-level organizers 
of these criminal syndicates.
    Question 2c. In your view, how effective have these measures proven 
thus far?
    Answer. In our county, we have used the organized retail theft 
statutes to bring justice and obtain higher sentences to increase 
accountability and deterrence in our region. We need stronger laws for 
the individual habitual offenders that are not as dramatic and 
instantly damaging as the ``smash-and-grabs'' but do have a long-term 
effect. They create a slow bleed and a demoralizing effect on employees 
and managers of large and small businesses along with severe negative 
economic impacts. We continue to evaluate cases individually to assess 
the correct level of accountability, recognizing that certain youthful 
offenders and non-repeat offenders can benefit from treatment to 
address the underlying causes for their conduct, but other habitual or 
organized criminals deserve strict consequences.
    Question 2d. Yes, or no, do you believe that ORC has been 
exaggerated and not a serious challenge? Please explain.
    Answer. The issue of ORC and habitual theft is a serious challenge 
that in our experience is not exaggerated--however there are 
inconsistent figures regarding the amount of losses and the prevalence 
of the criminal activity. Our experience tells us that multiple factors 
contribute to the disparities in the figures because many States 
including California did not even have Organized Retail Theft statutes 
until recently. Different stores track losses more generally to include 
fraud-related losses along with organized retail theft and theft. Law 
enforcement also does not have accurate data because many theft 
instances are not reported by store managers and owners who feel that 
nothing is going to happen especially when crimes against them are 
categorized as misdemeanors no matter how many times they are 
committed. As an example, I talked to one frustrated small business 
owner in my community who said that he places his less expensive 
merchandise (perfume) at the front of his store because he knows people 
are going to steal in this current environment, so he might as well 
offer up his less expensive merchandise. That is a sad commentary. We 
also have stores that leave their cases unlocked at night when the 
store closes so that burglars will take the product but and hopefully 
not break the expensive locked display cases. This is an unacceptable 
state of affairs.
    Question 3. Yes or no, do you believe that ORC is nonviolent? 
Please explain.
    Answer. The law categorizes Organized Retail Crime as nonviolent. 
Having talked to employees, loss prevention personnel, and customers 
who have been victims to ORC, their experience is one of fear and 
trauma which is very similar to experiencing a violent crime under the 
law. I do not view ORC as purely economic crime but rather as crime 
against human beings that puts them at risk of harm and leaves them in 
a state of vulnerability. In fact, many instances of ORC include or 
become a violent crime. Our stores have reported an increase in 
violence during thefts. A number of these crimes result in physical 
altercations or threats of harm. There are examples of loss prevention 
officers or store personnel in San Diego County being assaulted or 
threatened to be assaulted with fists or weapons. Store personnel have 
described the fear they sustained after a few people run into a store 
and openly grab numerous products and run out without touching anyone.
    This type of crime is unsettling and causes emotional trauma to all 
who are present whether it be store personnel or customers. Some 
personnel have stated that they are afraid to go back to work after 
such an event even when physical touching did not occur. There have 
been many recent cases in San Diego County where perpetrators knew that 
they only have to display a weapon (examples--a knife folded up, a 
pellet gun tucked in a waistband), and security will not interfere. 
It's the mere threat of violence that works and has become more and 
more common for our local store loss prevention officers.
    Additionally, in San Diego County, we have had cases where the ORC 
participants flee in vehicles at high speeds with reckless driving, 
sometimes striking other cars or bicyclists; and some have thrown 
products out of their windows during pursuits on the freeway, further 
endangering the public.
    Of course, we can't forget that in California and across the 
Nation, lives of employees have been taken by criminals in the course 
of committing theft.
    Question 4. There are numerous pieces of legislation that have been 
introduced to help combat ORC. In your opinion, what piece of 
legislation, if passed by Congress and signed by the President, would 
have the most instant impact in effectively combating ORC? Why?
    Answer. I am aware of 4 bills currently introduced to help combat 
ORC--S. 139, H.R. 895, S. 140, and H.R. 316.
    While all these bills proposed would positively impact our united 
struggle against ORC, we believe H.R. 895 and S. 140, its Senate bill 
companion, cover a critical need to coordinate efforts in order to 
combat this organized crime more effectively. H.R. 895/S. 140 seeks to 
create an ``Organized Retail Crime Coordination Center''--which, under 
the text of the bill, is intended to coordinate efforts not only with 
Federal agencies but also with State and local agencies and with the 
retail stores. The bill calls for the sharing of information and 
efforts by a team.
    We recommend that these bills be amended to include the addition of 
local prosecutors such as myself to the coordinated task forces. 
District attorneys are your local prosecutors with direct access and 
partnership with local law enforcement and can bring important insight 
and contribution to the task force. Our success in San Diego County is 
based, in large part, on the team network we have developed with local 
law enforcement and prosecutors in our various cities and nearby 
counties along with our relationships with our major retailers. As you 
are aware, these groups target multiple jurisdictions at once and 
through coordinated efforts, here in San Diego, we have been able to 
identify perpetrators and put together large loss cases involving 
multiple thefts. It is our hope the same can be true at the Federal 
level. The coordination center contemplated could benefit 
investigations across the board and hopefully provide the same type of 
teamwork which would result in large successful prosecutions.
    Question 5. There are more than 30 States that have passed ORC 
laws, while other States are considering similar measures. Please 
elaborate on these efforts and how they could help address the rise in 
ORC.
    Answer. In my opinion, the laws that could have the greatest impact 
on ORC would be the following:
  <bullet> A law that would allow all the ORC that occur in various 
        counties in a particular State to be prosecuted in a single 
        jurisdiction by the local prosecutor that has the readiness, 
        passion, and resources to bring a complex case to justice. That 
        would allow the penalties (and accompanying deterrent effect) 
        to be increased. Additionally, such laws would promote judicial 
        efficiency and save money when violators are not punished in 
        multiple counties in sequential order.
  <bullet> A law that would increase consequences commensurate with the 
        crimes and the criminal history of the offender to include 
        creating new and stronger aggregation and great financial 
        taking laws.
  <bullet> A law that would increase consequences whenever an object 
        that threatens safety is used even if it is used on physical 
        objects such as doors, windows, and display cases in the 
        presence of people.
  <bullet> Laws that would curtail the sales of stolen items in the on-
        line marketplace. Strengthening the INFORM act by providing 
        more resources to investigate those cases. If there were less 
        opportunities to re-sell the items, the perpetrators would be 
        less likely to steal. We must remember that there is a 
        relationship between the increase in ORC and repeat theft with 
        the proliferation of unregulated on-line market spaces that 
        were used as anonymous pawn shops. Enforcing the regulations 
        brought about by the INFORM act will be pivotal to reduce this 
        criminal activity.
    Question 6. Do you believe that the rise in organized retail theft 
is exacerbated by certain bail reform measures, such as in Los Angeles 
or New York City? If so, what do you recommend would help combat this 
problem?
    Answer. It is important that persons who pose a threat to the 
community by the demonstrated facts of the current crime including ORC, 
along with their past criminal history and history of failure to appear 
be brought before the Judge and not released before all the factors 
relevant to detention under the law are evaluated giving consideration 
to community safety.

         Questions From Chairman August Pfluger for Scott Glenn
         
    Question 1a. We have heard from several retail industry businesses 
and representative organizations and there does not seem to be a 
universally-accepted definition of organized retail crime.
    Do you consider credit card and gift card fraud as well as skimming 
attacks, credit card payment processing system hacks, and even 
ransomware attacks as a part of organized retail crime that are 
increasing costs for retailers?
    Answer. We agree that different entities have different variations 
of what ORC means. However, we believe that the method of fraud is less 
important than the effect. Credit & gift card fraud as well as many 
other tactical methods can certainly be types of ORC similar to brick-
and-mortar product theft.
    Question 1b. How damaging are these types of fraud schemes versus 
the physical theft of product that has garnered so much attention 
lately?
    Answer. All types including these types create incremental pressure 
to the financials of the business and are a cause for concern. Physical 
theft of product still creates an additional opportunity for associate 
safety concerns, which we will always prioritize.
    Question 1c. Are these frauds also increasing year over year as 
dramatically as the attacks on physical inventory?
    Answer. We have seen an increase in rates of fraud and cyber attack 
attempts.
    Question 2a. A recent report released by Mayor Adams of New York 
highlights that organized retail criminals exploit New York law by 
stealing less than $1,000 of merchandise, thereby avoiding a felony 
charge. California has a similar statute that categorizes theft of less 
than $950 as a misdemeanor.
    Is this practice of stealing less than $1,000 worth of merchandise 
common, and what other practices and tools do these criminals utilize 
to commit crimes, avoid detection, and evade prosecution?
    Answer. Criminals often understand specific theft statutes and 
felony thresholds; they leverage this understanding to limit their 
potential punishment. The Home Depot has been a leader in calling for 
aggregation penalties that help close these ``loopholes''.
    Question 2b. Several States have recently passed laws aimed at 
increasing penalties on so-called ``boosters,'' the lower-level 
criminals who repeatedly shoplift, in the hope that this will 
eventually lead to the identification of organized crime kingpins. How 
effective have these measures proven thus far?
    Answer. Increased penalties are a net positive to reducing and 
preventing the crimes.
    We have found that ``boosters'' faced with stronger penalties, 
particularly via the aforementioned aggregation statutes, are more 
willing to cooperate with on-going investigations.
    Question 3. Several States have recently passed laws aimed at 
increasing penalties on so-called ``boosters,'' the lower-level 
criminals who repeatedly shoplift, in the hope that this will 
eventually lead to the identification of organized crime kingpins.
    In your view, how effective have these measures proven thus far?
    Answer. See answer above.
    Question 4. Yes, or no, do you believe that ORC has been 
exaggerated and not a serious challenge? Please explain.
    Answer. No, ORC has not been exaggerated. Based on our internal 
data we have seen steady increases in this activity and impact.
    Question 5. Yes or no, do you believe that ORC is nonviolent? 
Please explain.
    Answer. No, while not all ORC operations are violent, it is not 
uncommon for violence to be associated.

         Questions From Chairman August Pfluger for Abby Jagoda 

    Question 1a. We have heard from several retail industry businesses 
and representative organizations and there does not seem to be a 
universally-accepted definition of organized retail crime.
    Do you consider credit card and gift card fraud as well as skimming 
attacks, credit card payment processing system hacks, and even 
ransomware attacks as a part of organized retail crime that are 
increasing costs for retailers?
    Answer. ICSC is unable to provide meaningful insight on these 
trends. Our focus has been on the organized theft of physical 
merchandise from sellers located at retail facilities, such as malls 
and shopping centers. ICSC sees fraud involving financial networks and 
targeting the payment infrastructure as a separate category typically 
targeting retailers. H.R. 895, for instance, defines ORC as any crime 
described in Section 2314 or 2315 of Title 18, United States Code 
(receipt and transportation of stolen goods) and conspiracy to 
transport or receive stolen goods.
    Question 1b. How damaging are these types of fraud schemes versus 
the physical theft of product that has garnered so much attention 
lately?
    Answer. ICSC is more familiar with the issues related to physical 
theft and safety than the other type of activity you are inquiring 
about.
    Question 1c. Are these frauds also increasing year over year as 
dramatically as the attacks on physical inventory?
    Answer. As stated, ICSC has limited visibility into the effects of 
fraud schemes that you have described that target retailers.
    A recent report released by Mayor Adams of New York highlights that 
organized retail criminals exploit New York law by stealing less than 
$1,000 of merchandise, thereby avoiding a felony charge. California has 
a similar statute that categorizes theft of less than $950 as a 
misdemeanor.
    Question 2a. Is this practice of stealing less than $1,000 worth of 
merchandise common, and what other practices and tools do these 
criminals utilize to commit crimes, avoid detection, and evade 
prosecution?
    Answer. It is our observation that many individuals taking part in 
organized retail crime activities are aware of and actively monitor 
changes in legal standards, particularly felony thresholds.
    Question 2b. Several States have recently passed laws aimed at 
increasing penalties on so-called ``boosters,'' the lower-level 
criminals who repeatedly shoplift, in the hope that this will 
eventually lead to the identification of organized crime kingpins. How 
effective have these measures proven thus far?
    Answer. Many such laws have been passed in the past 12-18 months, 
and it is too soon to speculate on progress. As well, the collection of 
data has proven challenging as we know many ORC incidents are not 
reported to authorities, including local police or mall management. A 
Federal coordination center--the natural next step to the progress made 
under HSI's Operation Boiling Point--would aid in the collection of 
this data.
    Question 4. Yes, or no, do you believe that ORC has been 
exaggerated and not a serious challenge? Please explain.
    Answer. Yes, ICSC firmly believes that ORC is a significant problem 
in America. As stated, many ORC instances are not reported to law 
enforcement and thus the scope of the problem may be larger than many 
realize. When shoppers and store workers feel unsafe, stores may choose 
to close locations and economic activity may decline. A number of 
retailers have also taken to locking up merchandise or curtailing self-
checkout to stop stealing. Unfortunately, these practices inconvenience 
all shoppers for the sake of safety of consumers and store personnel. 
Retailers are taking these steps out of necessity.
    Question 5. Yes or no, do you believe that ORC is nonviolent? 
Please explain.
    Answer. No, ORC often involves direct violence and explicit threats 
of violence. There have been numerous examples of assaults against 
store employees, some fatal, related to ORC.
