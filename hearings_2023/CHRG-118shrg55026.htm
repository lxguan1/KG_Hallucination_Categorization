                                       U.S. Senate,
                            Committee on Veterans' Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 3:29 p.m., in 
Room SR-418, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Jon Tester, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

    Present: Senators Tester, Brown, Blumenthal, Hirono, 
Hassan, King, Moran, Tillis, and Tuberville.

        OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, CHAIRMAN,
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Chairman Tester. I want to call this hearing to order. Good 
afternoon. Welcome to today's hearing to examine VA's readiness 
to support our Nation in times of crisis. I understand that we 
have four people who have never been in front of a Senate 
Committee today. We're going to work you over anyway. I'm 
sorry. Now, we appreciate what you do, and we appreciate you 
being here, and thank you for taking the time out of your busy 
schedule to join us.
    We have seen an increase in the number of and intensity of 
natural and weather-related events, which have brought much 
hardship and destruction. In Montana, for example, we saw 
unprecedented flooding of the Yellowstone River in June 2022. 
More recently, Senator Hirono's beloved Hawaii was rocked by 
fast moving wildfires in Maui. That's why the VA's authority to 
provide humanitarian assistance or respond to FEMA's 
assignments is critically important.
    Known as VA's Fourth Mission, this role is meant to improve 
the Nation's preparedness for response to war, terrorism, 
emergencies, and natural disasters. During the pandemic, we saw 
VA's ability to help communities nationwide with its vast 
emergency response capabilities. It completed nearly 200 formal 
mission assignments from FEMA, which helped citizens in 47 
States, District of Columbia, American Samoa, and Guam.
    In carrying out these missions, VA deployed more than 6,000 
staff volunteers to help minimize staff shortages nationwide 
and help train others in critical infection control measures 
that admitted nearly 500 non-Veteran patients to VA facilities 
when the community was overrun with COVID patients or 
experiencing staffing shortages.
    This is critically important in my home State of Montana, 
where our VA hospital at Fort Harrison stepped up to serve 
folks in the community. The acute nature of COVID-19 pandemic 
highlighted how fragile the Nation supply chain is. Essential 
medications were in short supply and materials to make PPE 
dwindled. I hope to hear from the VA about its efforts to 
address those challenges ahead of future disasters.
    As the largest integrated healthcare system in the United 
States, VA stands in a unique position to bolster the supply 
chain and address some of these challenges. VA has long relied 
on an all-volunteer workforce to respond in emergency 
situations. I want to know if this is a sustainable staffing 
model, given the increasing frequency of which they're being 
called up.
    These are about a handful of areas VA will need to consider 
as it seeks to make its system more robust to manage caring for 
our Nation's Veterans, and acting as a backstop for our 
Nation's broader healthcare system in times of crisis.
    With that, I'll turn it over to Senator Moran.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JERRY MORAN,
            RANKING MEMBER, U.S. SENATOR FROM KANSAS

    Senator Moran. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I remember when I 
was the Chairman of this Committee. I was never late.
    Chairman Tester. So I was here on time.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Moran. But you were late, I think, then. Late was 
defined by the one who had the gavel, I believe.
    I thank all of our witnesses for joining us today. I 
appreciate the opportunity to be with you and discuss the VA's 
emergency preparedness and response, including the work the VA 
does through its so-called Fourth Mission.
    I didn't really know much about the Fourth Mission until 
the arrival of the pandemic, and then saw the value of the 
preparation that had occurred in advance, and the role that the 
VA and its employees played. It was an integral role during 
that pandemic, and not only in caring for Veterans, which was 
an increased challenge itself, but also helping to support 
State and local hospitals, and healthcare authorities. I saw it 
in the State of Kansas, and I'm grateful.
    I'm grateful for the hard work that the VA leaders and 
frontline staff provided during the pandemic. I'm also grateful 
for the hard work that the VA staff continues to do every day 
in response to natural disasters and emergencies. Today, I want 
to hear how the VA is leveraging the lessons learned from, 
during the pandemic to improve the Department's capacity to 
care for Veterans, avoid VA staff burnout, and provide needed 
support to Federal, State, and local authorities during 
emergency circumstances.
    In recent months, I have heard from a number of Kansans, VA 
healthcare workers specifically, who are worried about their 
ability to efficiently and effectively respond to crisis 
scenarios. That is partly due to the vulnerabilities of the 
VA's healthcare infrastructure, which outdates the private 
sector by decades, and was built to meet a very different model 
of care than the one we have today. I hope the VA witnesses 
will be able to tell me how the VA's emergency preparedness 
efforts are addressing that challenge.
    I would be remiss, at least from my perspective, if I did 
not take this opportunity to talk just a moment about the VA's 
pending rulemaking regarding reimbursement rates for emergency 
medical transportation services. Every day, Veterans in the 
midst of medical emergencies rely on air and ground ambulances 
to get them the care they need as quickly as possible. 
Significantly reducing payment rates for these lifesaving 
services, which the VA is currently on track to do in February, 
will have a devastating impact on Veterans.
    Chairman Tester, Senator Boozman, Senator Murray, and I 
have been leading the charge against this reduction, and I want 
to take this opportunity today to once again call on Secretary 
McDonough to do what I think is the right thing and reverse 
course on this rule before it jeopardizes Veteran lives.
    Mr. Chairman, I thank you and yield back.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Senator Moran for your 
statement.
    Today, we're going to hear from just one panel of 
witnesses, but they're powerful. We have Bobby Small Jr. who's 
the Acting Executive Director of the Office of Emergency 
Management and Resilience at VA. He's accompanied by two VHA 
colleagues, Dr. Michelle Dorsey, the Deputy Assistant Under 
Secretary for Health Operations, and Derrick Jaastad, the 
Executive Director of the Office of Emergency Management. I 
also want to welcome Dr. John Balbus, the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Climate Change and Health Equity at HHS.
    Welcome you-all to the Committee. Mr. Small, you may begin.

STATEMENT OF BOBBY SMALL JR., ACTING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, OFFICE 
OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND RESILIENCE, DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS 
 AFFAIRS; ACCOMPANIED BY MICHELLE DORSEY, MD, DEPUTY ASSISTANT 
    UNDER SECRETARY FOR HEALTH OPERATIONS, VETERANS HEALTH 
ADMINISTRATION; AND DERRICK JAASTAD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, OFFICE 
    OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

    Mr. Small. Good afternoon, Chairman Tester, Ranking Member 
Moran, and Members of the Committee. I'm pleased to be here 
today to discuss the Department of Veterans Affairs emergency 
response to natural climate change-driven disasters, and how VA 
help the communities impacted by disasters.
    VA's Fourth Mission is to improve the Nation preparedness 
to respond to war, terrorism, national emergencies, natural 
disasters by developing plans and taking action to ensure 
continued services to Veterans, as well as support to the 
Nation, State, local emergency management, public health, 
public safety, and homeland security efforts.
    The Fourth Mission is a critical operation capability that 
leverages VA personnel, equipment, and infrastructure to 
support greater resource sharing across Federal departments and 
agencies in accordance with Presidential Policy Directive 8 and 
the National Response Framework.
    Each administration supports the VA Fourth Mission by 
developing and implementing policies, programs, and 
capabilities to ensure access to and delivery of healthcare 
services and benefits while building a culture of preparedness 
and resiliency. VA has emergency managers strategically located 
around the country who work with local VA facilities and 
communities on a daily basis to assist with mitigation, 
preparedness, and response and recovery efforts.
    These emergency managers deploy to State emergency 
operation centers during emergencies to support ongoing 
operations and serve as the eyes and ears of the 
administration. This construct allows the VA to have a 
comprehensive approach to coordinating Fourth Mission 
requirements, from the VA's Integrated Operations Center down 
to a State, local government, or facility.
    Strengthening VA's capabilities to support Fourth Mission 
natural disaster operation requires planning against risk and 
associated impacts that would exceed local, State, territory, 
or tribal resources, including high consequence and plausible 
concurrent disasters like those that unfolded across the Nation 
throughout COVID-19.
    It equally requires a well-trained resource and coordinated 
approach between internal and external stakeholders, and a 
consistent and effective means for exercising our planning, 
continuity, decision support, and communication capabilities in 
a complex emergency environment.
    The Department's annual continuity exercise, Eagle Horizon, 
tests our readiness and capabilities in event of a major 
emergency. It allows us to test our continuity of operations 
procedures, and emergency communications, internally, and with 
our Federal partners.
    VA knows firsthand the effects of climate and natural 
disaster on our missions workforce and the Veteran community we 
serve. For example, last year's, hurricane season saw three 
landfalls along the coast of the U.S. mainland with Hurricane 
Ian, tying for the fifth strongest hurricane wind speed at 
landfall in the U.S. These three storms alone affected 3.2 
million Veterans and 30,000 VA staff providing care and 
benefits to many of them.
    VA's Climate Action Plan outlines VA's response to the 
projected impacts of climate change to the Department with the 
goal of ensuring sustained operations to support uninterrupted 
delivery of benefits and service and VA's Fourth Mission. Given 
the wide distribution of VA facilities throughout the U.S. and 
its territories, VA facilities are impacted by most major 
national disasters. VA will continue to focus on mitigation 
strategies and preparedness activities, as un-remediated 
facilities or more frequently damaged or destroyed due to 
increased storm activities and sea level rise.
    I appreciate this opportunity to share VA's emergency 
response to natural climate change-driven disasters and 
demonstrate how VA helps the community impacted by disasters. 
Our objectives, even in an all-hazards environment, is to give 
our Nation's Veterans the top quality care they have earned and 
deserve, and support our Fourth Mission capabilities when 
called upon to do so.
    I appreciate this Committee's continued support and 
encouragement in identifying and resolving challenges as we 
find new ways to care for Veterans. This concludes my opening 
statement. My colleagues and I are prepared to respond to any 
questions you may have, sir.

    [The prepared statement of Mr. Small appears on page 25 of 
the Appendix.]

    Chairman Tester. We'll have questions. Thank you, Mr. 
Small. Dr. Balbus, you are up next, and know that both of your 
full written comments will be a part of the record.

    STATEMENT OF JOHN M. BALBUS, MD, MPH, DEPUTY ASSISTANT 
 SECRETARY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH EQUITY, DEPARTMENT OF 
                   HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

    Dr. Balbus. Good afternoon, everybody, and Chairman Tester, 
and Ranking Member Moran, Members of the Committee. I'd like to 
thank you for this opportunity to discuss the work of the 
Office of Climate Change and Health Equity to build greater 
climate resilience and sustainability in the country's 
healthcare delivery systems.
    The Secretary of Health and Human Services established our 
office in response to Executive Order 14008, and the Office was 
officially launched August 31, 2021, with the mission to help 
protect the health of people in the United States, especially 
those most vulnerable from the health impacts of climate 
change.
    As a focal point for action to address the climate crisis 
within the entire Department of Health and Human Services, 
we've also taken on ensuring that health systems in the United 
States are resilient to increasingly severe climate-related 
threats, and also reducing their own significant contributions 
to greenhouse gas pollution.
    I'm pleased to appear today together with colleagues from 
the Veterans Health Administration and plan to emphasize the 
following points. First, the health impacts of climate change 
are being felt now throughout the United States, but the 
suffering induced falls most heavily on low income, 
disadvantaged populations, and other vulnerable groups. In 
addition to the health impacts, the health system impacts of 
climate change are also being felt now with attendant health 
impacts from that and economic damages. Climate change 
compounds all the other financial stresses on health systems.
    Fortunately, initial steps that address both health system 
resilience and greenhouse gas pollution reduction, like health 
system microgrids, also reduce energy costs for the systems 
that install them. The Office of Climate Change and Health 
Equity is helping coordinate an all-of-government approach to 
the health aspects of the climate crisis, including helping 
ensure the healthcare safety net of the country is able to take 
full advantage of technical assistance and financial resources 
provided for sustainability and resilience. For example, those 
that are available through the Inflation Reduction Act.
    This past summer brought unprecedented human suffering and 
damage from extreme weather events across the country. From the 
wildfire smoke degrading air quality in New York City, to the 
devastation of Maui, many parts of the country directly 
experienced more frequent and more severe climate change 
impacts than ever before. And these climate-related impacts 
directly impacted the health and well-being of those living in 
the United States.
    But the impacts were not equitably distributed. We know 
certain populations such as children, older adults, those with 
chronic health conditions and living with disabilities, racial 
and ethnic minorities, and people experiencing homelessness are 
more at risk of negative health outcomes from climate-related 
hazards. This is true for both the general population and 
specifically for Veterans.
    For example, a recent publication from the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, Stanford University, the University of Iowa, 
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that 
Black and American Indian, Alaska Native Veterans were more 
likely to be diagnosed with heat-related illnesses, and 
Veterans with coexisting medical conditions also saw a greater 
increase in heat-related illness over time. And importantly, 
that report found that the rate of heat-related illness in 
Veterans had increased between 2002 and 2019.
    After a summer of record breaking temperatures, Maricopa 
County, Arizona recently announced there were 425 heat-related 
deaths in 2023, tying the record from 2022, but with nearly 200 
deaths still under investigation. In 2022, 42 percent of the 
heat-related deaths in Maricopa County were among individuals 
experiencing homelessness, and 67 percent involved substance 
use. And of those deaths involving substance use, over half 
were among individuals experiencing homelessness.
    These sobering statistics from Arizona are relevant to the 
care of Veterans as well. In 2022, over 33,000 Veterans were 
experiencing homelessness on any given night comprising 
approximately 7 percent of all adults experiencing homelessness 
in the U.S. And additionally, more than 20 percent of Veterans 
with post-traumatic stress disorder also have concomitant 
substance use disorder.
    In addition to these health impacts, climate change also 
poses risks of stress and disruption to healthcare delivery. 
Climate-related extreme weather events and disasters can 
disrupt healthcare systems at multiple points, creating a surge 
in demand, resulting in staffing shortages, affecting critical 
supply chains, and damaging infrastructure. And we've seen how 
health system failures have resulted in loss of life after 
Hurricane Ida, Superstorm Sandy, and especially Hurricane Maria 
in Puerto Rico, where roughly 3,000 excess deaths occurred over 
the four months following the storm.
    And we know that climate change will continue to have an 
impact. A 2022 study found approximately one-third of 
metropolitan statistical areas on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts 
have half or more of their hospitals at risk of flooding from 
even relatively weak hurricanes. Sea level rise, increased 
frequency and severity of hurricanes will further increase this 
risk. And unfortunately, there's been very little investment in 
studies like this that highlight future risks, and especially 
studies that analyze the specific tipping points that have 
caused health systems to fail in extreme events. We hope this 
evidence base can be built to make facilities and systems more 
resilient and to save lives.
    Our office aims to have the entire health sector working 
together to meet the challenges of climate change. That means 
becoming more prepared for climate events and also more 
sustainable, decreasing the health sector's 8.5 percent 
contribution to our country's greenhouse gas emissions.
    Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through interventions 
like increased energy efficiency and renewable energy sources 
can reduce operating costs, freeing resources for investment in 
essential patient services, and this has been documented in 
several instances.
    Moreover, emissions reduction and resilience are closely 
related. As an example, the VA makes renewable power part of 
its facility infrastructure and equipment upgrades where 
feasible.
    Chairman Tester. I would ask you to wrap it up.
    Dr. Balbus. Okay. VA hospitals use 38 percent less energy 
per square foot in the national average, and by installing 
onsite renewable power, VA facilities become more resilient to 
grid failures.
    I have much more to talk about. I want to highlight that 
our office is convening the Federal Health Systems, the Indian 
Health Service, the Veterans Health Administration, the Defense 
Health Agency, and the Bureau of Prisons to work on climate 
resilience and sustainability of the systems, and especially as 
required by Executive Order 14057 to reduce the greenhouse gas 
emissions. We've also created----
    Chairman Tester. That's good enough. Senator Moran has 
another hearing he needs to get to, and so we're going to go to 
questions. Thank you. Your entire statement will be part of the 
record.
    Dr. Balbus. It's all in writing, and so I appreciate the 
opportunity.

    [The prepared statement of Dr. Balbus appears on page 36 of 
the Appendix.]

    Chairman Tester. Senator Moran.
    Senator Moran. Thank you for your testimony. I apologize 
for the intrusion by the Chairman, but he's trying to be 
helpful to me. And I'm grateful for that.
    Mr. Small, I'm going to ask my--I think my questions to 
you. There's a whistleblower from the U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection that recently reached out to my staff indicating 
that the VA is paying for healthcare services provided to non-
citizens in detention.
    A VA portal established for community providers to submit 
claims to the VA for healthcare for non-citizens, includes 
documentation that this has been going on since at least 2020. 
ICE reporting to Congress references, ``a service level 
agreement between the VA and DHS for the provision of those 
services.''
    Under what authority is the VA providing claims processing 
services to non-citizens at the border?
    Mr. Small. Yes, Senator. Thank you for that question. I'm 
not aware of these allegations. I will defer to my colleagues 
in Veterans Health Administration to see if they're aware of 
such allegations.
    Chairman Tester. Are either of you aware of the situation 
Senator Moran talked about?
    Mr. Jaastad. I am not aware of enrollment and beneficiaries 
or delivery of healthcare services being provided. I am aware 
of the support that VHA is providing to our Veteran service 
members within Customs and Border Patrol, and specifically 
counseling and making sure that they are able to continue to 
receive the services that they're entitled to.
    Senator Moran. That makes sense, Mr. Jaastad, to me, but I 
would be interested if you could follow up with a response. I'd 
like to make sure we're prioritizing the healthcare for 
Veterans that--we regularly hear about the shortage of 
providers, and I want to make sure that we're focused as our 
priority at the VA is on Veterans.
    And then if there, I'm told is a copy, there is a service 
level agreement that I mentioned, and it would be useful--
that's between the VA and DHS--it would be useful if me and my 
staff could see a copy of that agreement.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
VA Response: VA is currently gathering the requested Service Level
 Agreements (SLAs) with DHS in response to the Committee's request. We
 are working to have copies to the Committee early January.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


    And then Mr. Small, I would think you would defer answering 
this question as well. And I say that with a smile, I'm not 
cringing at that, but you heard me mention the emergency 
transportation issue. It is an important one. It's an important 
one now, it's an important one when we have a significant 
emergency or national disaster in our country.
    In February, the VA's reimbursement rates for air and 
ground ambulance services are going to be significantly reduced 
in accordance with a pending VA rule change. Ambulance 
providers across the country have told me that this will 
substantially reduce the availability of ambulance services for 
Veterans and for other Americans. This is particularly an 
important issue for me as a Kansan in the rural nature of our 
State, and air ambulance service is hugely important in the 
delivery of a patient to a regional hospital.
    I understand that the VA is considering delaying 
implementation of that rule, and I indicated in my testimony 
that the Chairman, Chairman Tester, and Senator Boozman, 
Senator Murray, we've all been calling on the VA to do so. I've 
been asking the VA for the last month for clarity on their path 
forward and yet to receive a response.
    My question is, is the VA intending to delay implementation 
of the rule to reset reimbursement rates for emergency 
transportation services beyond the current February 2024, 
effective date?
    Mr. Small. Yes, Senator, thank you for that question. Yes, 
my colleagues in VHA do manage a patient movement program for 
the Department. So I will defer to my colleague Derrick Jaastad 
for a response.
    Mr. Jaastad. Ranking Member Moran, while I cannot speak to 
the day-to-day transportation, I can speak to what we are doing 
within the realm of Federal patient movement as the Executive 
Director of the Office of Emergency Management.
    The efficient, timely, and consistent ability to move 
survivors of disaster or uniformed service members to 
definitive care is my number one priority. We maintain 48 
Federal Coordinating Centers as well as hundreds upon hundreds 
of NDMS partner facilities. Over the last 18 months, I am very, 
very proud of the number of full-scale exercises that we have 
had the opportunity to conduct, reestablishing relationships 
within healthcare coalitions within our emergency medical 
service providers, as well as with other community partners.
    And so when we speak of the need to move patients, 
especially those impacted by disasters or other events, I am 
very confident in our ability to ensure that those survivors 
are reaching definitive care.
    Happy to take the transportation question on the day-to-day 
back for record.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
VA Response: VA is changing the rates that we pay for special mode
 transportation services--including air ambulance transportation--to
 better align with the rest of the health care industry while continuing
 to provide world-class, affordable care to those we serve. According to
 a report from the Inspector General in 2018, VA had been paying about
 60% more than the industry standard (CMS rates) for ambulance services.
 To address this discrepancy and be good stewards of taxpayer money, VA
 undertook rulemaking to change the rates VA pays for air ambulance
 services. Under the new regulation, VA will pay the lesser of actual
 charge associated with an ambulance service, or the standard CMS rate
 for that service, unless a separate rate has been established based on
 local contracts between air ambulance providers and local VA medical
 centers. VA intends to include terms in these contracts to ensure that
 Veteran care will not be adversely impacted, and that Veterans will not
 receive bills for these services. More information about these changes
 can be found here: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/02/16/
 2023-03013/change-in-rates-va-pays-for-special-modes-of-transportation.
 
These changes were originally slated to become effective on February 16,
 2024, but VA is currently developing a rule that will delay the
 effective date by approximately one year, until February 2025. VA
 expects the rule delaying the effective date to be published prior to
 February 16, 2024.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Senator Moran. Mr. Jaastad, would you, or Mr. Small, or Dr. 
Dorsey, would you visit with my staff at the conclusion of this 
hearing and see if we can find a path forward to get 
information from the VA with your assistance?
    Mr. Small. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Moran. Thank you all very much.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Tester. Senator Hirono.

                     HON. MAZIE K. HIRONO,
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII

    Senator Hirono. I just wanted to submit for the record a 
statement, especially after the Maui fires. So thank you.
    Senator Hirono. In August, Hawaii experienced our worst 
natural disaster since becoming a State in 1959 and the 
deadliest wildfire in our country since 1918 when wildfires 
ripped through communities in West upcountry Maui. And in mere 
moments, an entire town, Lahaina was destroyed and thousands of 
people lost their homes and all their belongings, including 
many Veterans.
    There is some 7,000 people still living in hotels and 
Airbnbs, and providing long-term homes, including, of course, 
for the Veterans in those communities remain a huge priority. 
But thankfully, VA of the Pacific Islands Healthcare System was 
able to operationalize quickly, contacting the most vulnerable 
Veterans by phone or text, and assessing whether there would be 
issues accessing critical services like dialysis or treatments 
like oxygen.
    In the days following the wildfire, leaders at the VA 
central office were communicative about steps that they had 
already taken and planned to take to support Veterans impacted 
by the wildfire. In addition, VA was present at hotels, housing 
those who were displaced, and the Disaster Resource Center to 
let Veterans and family members know what services were 
available to them.
    In this extremely challenging time, VA stepped up to ensure 
our Veterans and others in the community had the essentials 
they needed. Unfortunately, we know that natural disasters, 
like the fires of Maui, are only becoming more commonplace, 
underscoring the importance of VA's own preparedness and its 
Fourth Mission.
    I hope we can use this hearing to capture any lessons 
learned from VA's response to the wildfires, and ensure we're 
equipping local VA facilities and staff with the tools they 
need to respond to other disasters in the future.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing so that 
we can begin to work with our agency partners to bolster 
preparedness and response to extreme weather events that are 
becoming far too commonplace. And I'm glad that we have a 
witness who is very much focused on climate change as being one 
of the reasons that we are seeing so many of these natural 
disasters.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Senator Tuberville.

                     HON. TOMMY TUBERVILLE,
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ALABAMA

    Senator Tuberville. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for 
appearing today. Your first time up, huh? Interesting.
    Dr. Balbus, you're talking about medical centers 
implementing microgrid and solar power systems on top of 
parking lots. Given in my State of Alabama, but I'm going to a 
couple of them next week before Thanksgiving, we have some good 
ones and we have some not so good. How do we use our priorities 
in terms of whether we put something on top of a building for 
solar panels or whatever, how do we make a decision on what's 
more important, the building or the microgrid? I mean, how do 
you do that? Because we've got a lot of bad buildings in the 
country.
    Dr. Balbus. I think that's an excellent question, and it 
really has to be decided on an institution-by-institution 
basis, and an assessment of the risks. Your point as well taken 
that for some facilities, the flooding could be such a risk 
that that's where the first dollar should go.
    All of this is about risk management and ensuring, you 
know, reducing the financial risk to an already stressed health 
system. Loss of revenue from being shut down by a flood or shut 
down by another event is as devastating as a decrease in 
reimbursement. But the fact that there is this financial 
incentive for the renewable energy and microgrids, and that the 
operation costs decline after that, make that a financially 
viable investment. But again, I wouldn't say--it'd have to be 
decided on a case-by-case basis whether you----
    Senator Tuberville. You don't do that then? You don't make 
those decisions.
    Dr. Balbus. I do not make those decisions. No.
    Senator Tuberville. All right. Let's go back to Senator 
Moran's question. Mr. Small, since 2021, 6.5 million people 
have been apprehended at our southern border. It's no secret 
that a lot of our States are beyond capacity. Does the VA 
consider the border surge a national emergency?
    Mr. Small. Senator, thank you for that question. The VA 
considers anything that impacts the Department's ability to 
provide service to our Veterans as something we should be 
concerned about.
    As far as the VA's position on the southern border, sir, 
I'm an emergency manager, sir, so I'm not equipped to answer 
that question, but I can take it back for clarification.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
VA Response: VA does not provide or fund any health care services to
 individuals detained in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
 custody. At no time are any VA health care professionals or VA funds
 used for this purpose. Congress has authorized VA to provide health
 care to non-Veterans under limited circumstances. The vast majority of
 this authorized non-Veteran care is provided to Veteran families--
 including the spouses and children of Veterans with severe
 disabilities, the spouses and children of Veterans who died from
 conditions associated with their military service, and the spouses and
 children of Veterans who died in the line of duty. VA is also
 authorized to provide or cover some health care for Veteran caregivers,
 family members of Veterans who served at Camp Lejeune, and allied
 Veterans in rare cases (at the expense of their home nations). VA also
 occasionally provides authorized care through its ``Fourth Mission,''
 in which VA employees support our nation's preparedness for response to
 war, terrorism, national emergencies, and natural disasters. Our top
 priority at VA is making sure that Veterans have timely access to the
 high-quality, world-class health care they deserve. In fiscal year
 2023, VA provided the most health care appointments to Veterans in VA
 history, and Veteran outpatient trust scores reached 91%.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Senator Tuberville. So what would be the VA's role if we 
considered it a national emergency? I mean, are we taking 
people in? I'm just asking.
    Mr. Small. I think the VA's role would be, Senator, to 
respond to any Fourth Mission requirement we may receive to 
support a national emergency.
    Senator Tuberville. Do you know if we're providing illegals 
with healthcare in VAs?
    Mr. Small. No, Senator, I'm not aware of that.
    Senator Tuberville. How could we find that out?
    Mr. Small. Senator, I would have to take that back to the 
Department and find an answer for you.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
VA Response: VA does not provide or fund any health care services to
 individuals detained in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
 custody. At no time have any VA health care professionals provided
 health care to individuals in ICE custody. Nor are any VA funds used
 for this purpose. The ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC) provides and pays
 for all health care services for individuals detained in its custody.
 
The Financial Services Center (FSC), which is part of VA's Office of
 Management, is a franchise fund organization that offers the
 administrative function of medical claims processing services to VA and
 other government agencies. Since 2002, FSC has had an Interagency
 Agreement with the Department of Homeland Security's IHSC to provide
 these administrative medical claims processing services. Under this
 agreement, IHSC pays fees to FSC for the claims processing services
 rendered and covers all disbursements made to pay for medical claims
 payments to providers. IHSC is solely responsible for the authorization
 of health care services and obtaining the providers to deliver the
 health care.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Senator Tuberville. What about doing abortions on illegals 
in VAs? Do you know of any of that happening?
    Mr. Small. No, Senator, I'm not aware of that happening.
    Senator Tuberville. Would anybody else like, like to chime 
in on this about the southern border? Anybody else?
    Mr. Jaastad. Senator Tuberville, Derrick Jaastad. One of 
the things that we have done and under our Fourth Mission is 
really taking care of our Federal interagency partners. We did 
so with COVID vaccines and administered thousands. We again, as 
I mentioned, are taking care of our colleagues in uniform in 
the Customs and Border Patrol with counseling services through 
readjustment counseling through ensuring that the Veterans that 
are entitled to care are being--that we're able to deliver care 
in those outpost areas.
    And so, whether that's the CBP, hopping in a van and going 
to one of our medical centers, or whether that's RCS and 
traveling out to their outposts. We're ensuring that those that 
are entitled to care are receiving care.
    Senator Tuberville. Well, I'll be going to a couple of them 
next week and close to the southern border. So we'll find out. 
I just hope we're taking care of our Veterans. As Senator 
Tester said, we need to take care of our Veterans. And I can 
understand that we need to give everybody healthcare, but it's 
real important to me we take care of our Veterans. Thank you-
all. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Tester. Senator Hirono.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you. This is for Dr. Balbus--am I 
pronouncing correctly? So in your testimony, you stated that 
the climate-related extreme weather events and disasters can 
disrupt healthcare systems at multiple points, creating a surge 
in healthcare demand, resulting in staffing shortages.
    So can you speak to how these kinds of events could further 
exacerbate our existing staffing shortages, and what are you 
doing to prepare for these kinds of eventualities?
    Dr. Balbus. So I think to just unpack that testimony a 
little bit. Events like heatwaves, like wildfire smoke events, 
or hurricanes, create injured patients, exacerbate underlying 
diseases, and that creates a patient demand. But in terms of 
staffing shortages in the setting of a disaster, that's more in 
the setting of flooding, or wind damage, or things like that in 
a very specific short-term sense.
    But of course as you're pointing out, that acute staffing 
shortage, because people can't get to work and--you know, but I 
take this from things like the analysis of Superstorm Sandy and 
what shut down the health systems. And in many cases, it was 
because the people who work there couldn't get there because of 
the flooding or because of having to care for their families.
    My office is not the office that manages healthcare 
workforce. That's part of HRSA, and so I can't answer, 
personally, how we are trying to address the workforce shortage 
overall. But, importantly, by doing the proper kind of an 
assessment, which is what our office is doing to create the 
guidance and the tools so that a healthcare facility can assess 
its accessibility in the setting of an unprecedented flood 
using forward-looking data, we can start to anticipate that 
kind of a problem and they can do workarounds on a facility-by-
facility basis.
    Senator Hirono. So of the panelists, how does the VA 
prepare? You have a lot of buildings, for example, facilities. 
And to prepare these facilities to withstand these natural 
disaster events, how do you do that in terms of making sure 
that your staff can get there and patients can get to your 
facilities, et cetera?
    Because in Hawaii, we have a number of VA facilities, 
CBOCs, we have the hospitals, et cetera. So can somebody 
respond to me, do you have something in writing that says here 
are all the different things that we're going to need to do to 
mitigate what happens in a disaster so that you can continue to 
provide services to the Veterans?
    Mr. Small. Yes, Senator. VA Office of Acquisition Logistics 
and Construction, is the lead for coordinating with various VA 
administrations and staff offices to evaluate available 
information to determine climate change-related risk affecting 
VA facilities.
    The results are used to develop a climate change risk list 
that is used to evaluate VA design standards and identify gaps, 
and help identify mitigation and preparedness measures the 
Department should take.
    Senator Hirono. And that includes instances where your 
infrastructure and facilities are destroyed during a natural 
disaster. There's a plan B?
    Mr. Small. Yes. The VA climate plan addresses new design 
standards as we bring on new facilities to make sure those new 
facilities are equipped for occurring climate change and sea 
level rises.
    Senator Hirono. So something specific as the wildfires in 
Lahaina. 7,000 people living in hotels. Do you know how many of 
those people are Veterans?
    Mr. Small. I do not, ma'am. I will refer to my colleagues 
in VHA. Maybe they can provide----
    Senator Hirono. They should know, right? The VA Pacific 
Healthcare System should know who the Veterans are or who have 
lost their homes. This is just an example of what can happen 
during a disaster, and how do you keep track of the Veterans, 
and how you provide them continuity of services?
    Mr. Jaastad. Yes. Senator, thank you for the question. 
While absolutely tragic, the loss of life, the loss of 
infrastructure, the loss of property. We were able to identify 
many promising practices coming out of the response, 
specifically of the VA, in Maui. The fact that we were able to 
deliver needed medicines, and medical supplies, prescriptions 
to our Veterans where they were. Our ability to track who was 
picking up prescriptions in order to understand who is still 
alive and receiving the necessary medicines that they require.
    Our ability to do outreach pre-event, or during the event, 
and post-event through our vulnerable patient care program and 
our VEText program is unprecedented. The ability for VA 
providers that we're moving from O'ahu to Maui, bringing 
supplies is a best practice. While there were many lessons 
learned, do we have the names of those that are still in 
hotels, no, but our providers know who they are.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you very much for your commitment and 
your ongoing presence to help us. Recovery will be long and 
take a lot of resources. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Tester. Senator King.

                    HON. ANGUS S. KING, JR.,
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE

    Senator King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I'll bet when you prepare for these hearings, you don't sit 
around saying, how will we handle a compliment? I want to 
deliver a serious compliment. We had a horrendous mass shooting 
in Maine just about a month ago today. And VA Maine stepped up 
immediately. They cleared beds in their hospital facility. They 
set up an incident command center. They made their chaplain 
available on a 24-hour basis. They provided outreach to the 
reserve squadron that this shooter was a member of.
    They did everything that they could have possibly done. 
They postponed a non-emergency surgery in order to be available 
as a backup to the local hospital. So I just want to get that 
on the record. This was a prime example of the Fourth Mission 
carried out in a stunningly effective and important way. And I 
want to thank you, and hope you'll pass my thanks on to the 
folks at Maine because they did a great job.
    Second question, dealing with emergencies, and this was a 
good example, almost all emergencies end up being handled 
primarily by the State and local authorities. FEMA has an 
important role, of course, but often the first responders are 
the State police or the State emergency management people.
    And I guess my question is, Mr. Small, to what extent do 
you have an institutional--develop an institutional Fourth 
Mission relationship with State and local emergency personnel?
    Mr. Small. Yes, Senator. Thank you for that question. VA 
emergency manager are embedded in the communities, but I would 
refer to my colleague here, Jaastad, to provide details how 
they work with the local communities on a daily basis, Senator.
    Senator King. Thank you.
    Mr. Jaastad. Thank you, first and foremost, for the 
compliment. It's very unfortunate that we have become 
proficient in having these services ready. We have a storied 
history in supporting mass shootings. The Pulse nightclub 
shooting. We deployed a number of Mobile Vet Centers as well as 
mobile medical units, and actually had to save at that event. 
In 2017, we also supported the Las Vegas mass shooting with, 
again, readjustment counseling service Mobile Vet Centers, as 
well as mobile medical units.
    The Northeast is unique. It is a tight-knit community. VA 
is a member of that community, whether it's the CBOC in 
Lewiston----
    Senator King. Maine is a big small town with very long 
streets.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Jaastad. But whether it's Lewiston or the Medical 
Center in Togus, there was no daylight between the State, 
between FEMA, between our area emergency managers, and those 
providers on the ground. When we look at how do we maintain 
those relationships with the State and with the communities, we 
do so deliberately and with intentionality----
    Senator King. That's what I'm looking for. There's a pre-
existing structure. It's not ad hoc when an emergency strikes.
    Mr. Jaastad. No, it is not. And when we look at--when 
emergency strikes, that's 25 percent of emergency management is 
response. 50 percent of emergency management is proactive. It's 
preparedness, and it is mitigation. It's developing those 
relationships locally and being that force multiplier to bring 
the full force and weight of multi agencies, many agencies in 
order to minimize the time we spend in response and the time we 
spend in recovery.
    The more we prepare, the more we mitigate, the more 
resources we can bring to bear for our Fourth Mission.
    Senator King. And it's important to me, it seems to me that 
the local and State emergency preparedness folks know of your 
capacity and as part of their toolkit.
    Mr. Jaastad. It absolutely is. And really, when we look at 
the investment that has been made in preparedness and in our 
ability to respond, we maintain a tremendous amount of national 
assets. Whether that's our mobile ICUs, our high water 
vehicles, our deployable resources, mobile medical units, 
Mobile Vet Centers, we have the reach because we are embedded 
in the communities and we've invested in our communities.
    Senator King. And I think you've answered this, but to be 
clear, this is a preexisting, conscious relationship that's 
built up prior to crisis. In other words, are there meetings, 
are there regular communications just to integrate the 
resources that you bring with local and State resources?
    Mr. Jaastad. There absolutely are.
    Senator King. This isn't a case where an emergency occurs 
and you call up and say, can we help? I presume there's already 
a relationship established.
    Mr. Jaastad. Within three minutes of the shooting being 
reported, the medical center director in Togus received a call. 
We're part of the community. We're part of the response.
    Senator King. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It was very impressive the way 
that came together.
    Chairman Tester. Indeed. Mr. Small, senior leaders from VHA 
participated in the daily coordination meetings hosted by FEMA 
during the pandemic. And what they found was there was 
considerable inter-agency fragmentation, at least early on. In 
some instances, the bureaucratic process for getting FEMA 
assignments delayed VA from providing care that was much 
needed.
    Now with the pandemic behind us, can you speak to any 
changes being made to the national framework that will benefit 
VA's ability to help in local communities even faster?
    Mr. Small. Thank you, Senator. VA headquarters maintain 
consistent coordination and participation in governing bodies, 
which allows continuous awareness of potential support at the 
local levels. During emergencies, we provide VA liaison to the 
National Response Coordination Center, and we are members in 
good standing of FEMA-led recovery support function leadership 
group, and emergency support leadership groups.
    This governing body coupled with continuous partnership 
with other Federal departments and agency, as well as the 
National Security Council, provide us an ability to translate 
local needs into improved policies and practices.
    Chairman Tester. So in your testimony, you know, the VA is 
partnering with DoD to conduct a DoD, Military-Civilian 
National Defense Medical System Interoperability Study--it is a 
mouthful. I trust a lot of lessons from the pandemic and other 
formal missions will inform this review. Are you able to 
provide this Committee with an update on the timeline for this 
work's completion?
    Mr. Small. Yes, Senator. My esteemed colleague, Mr. 
Jaastad, will provide the details, sir.
    Mr. Jaastad. Thank you, Chairman Tester, the MCNIS, if I 
can, the Military-Civilian National Disaster Medical System 
Interoperability Study is conducted by DoD through the National 
Disaster Medical System of which VA--there are five pilot 
sites.
    VA maintains two of those pilots, and these are our Federal 
Coordinating Centers, or FCCs. The two VA FCCs are in Denver 
and in Omaha. Year 1 of the pilot study was really the study 
part of it. Years 2 through 5, are implementation, years 5 and 
beyond, are expansion.
    Chairman Tester. So are you done?
    Mr. Jaastad. And just a little bit more.
    Chairman Tester. Keep going.
    Mr. Jaastad. We have partnered with DoD on this, and yes, 
we are looking at lessons learned. As a matter of fact, both 
the current director and the former director have been out to 
Martinsburg, West Virginia to walk through our assets.
    Chairman Tester. So can you talk about year 1? You're 
talking about year 2 through 5? You talked years 5 through 10. 
When was year 1?
    Mr. Jaastad. It predated me. I want to say it was 2020.
    Chairman Tester. 2020. So by 2025, you'll have the first 
assessments all done and ready for us to review?
    Mr. Jaastad. DoD is the primary.
    Chairman Tester. Right? But the assessments DoD is doing 
with you will be done so that we can review them?
    Mr. Jaastad. I cannot speak to DoD, sir.
    Chairman Tester. Neither can I. Well, Okay. We'll, we'll 
keep our eye out for that.
    Dr. Balbus, do you oversee pharmaceuticals within HHS?
    Dr. Balbus. My small office does not oversee 
pharmaceuticals that----
    Chairman Tester. So could you take this for the record?
    Dr. Balbus. Sure.
    Chairman Tester. There are more than a 100 high-use 
pharmaceutical products that are not produced domestically, but 
they're essential for common diseases like diabetes. These 
drugs are susceptible to global supply chain disruptions, and 
those supply chain disruptions occurred during the COVID-19 
pandemic. I believe they constitute a national security risk.
    So can you go back to your people and ask them what is 
being done in this realm to ensure that those supply chain 
challenges and disruptions don't occur in the next pandemic, or 
don't occur in the next natural disaster, or how about just 
don't occur?
    Dr. Balbus. Absolutely. Post-COVID, there is a lot of work 
on supply chain resilience as per the Administration for 
Strategic Preparedness and Response in the Food and Drug 
Administration, and we can come back with a summary of that.
    Chairman Tester. That'd be great.
    That same question for the VA. Not only pharmaceuticals, 
but beyond pharmaceuticals, critical supplies and equipment to 
help keep VA facilities running and serving Veterans. Some of 
it now is manufactured right here in America because of the 
pandemic. Is there anything the VA is doing to ensure that we 
have access to those supplies when we need them?
    Mr. Small. Yes, Senator. VA follows, complies with the Buy 
American Act, Trade Agreements, and Infrastructure Investment 
and Job Acts. Additionally, procurement officers interact with 
industry frequently to educate and inform them that the Federal 
Government, VA, must comply with the BAA, TAA, and we are very 
interested in products that are made in America.
    Chairman Tester. So the last question that I have is that 
you have volunteer teams called DEMPS. They play a critical 
role in the VA's Fourth Mission. Between the COVID-19 pandemic 
and near continuous use for responding to national and weather 
disasters across this country, the all-volunteer force is 
experiencing a high level of burnout.
    So, Mr. Small, can you update the Committee on recent 
efforts to establish a collection of dedicated deployment-ready 
teams?
    Mr. Small. Yes, sir.
    Chairman Tester. Or maybe you have a different view on the 
burnout issue.
    Mr. Small. No, I do not, Senator. But before I hand this 
question over to my esteemed colleague, Derrick Jaastad, I just 
would like to reiterate our commitment to conducting realistic 
national level exercise permitting us to test our strategic 
level-readiness of the Department through engagements of our 
senior leadership on the complexity associated with emergency 
environment.
    Additionally, this continued engagement and exercise of our 
continuity of operations, emergency relocation groups, our 
devolution emergency relocation group provides a mechanism for 
testing and training our communications to the administration 
and the staff officers. But I will defer to----
    Chairman Tester. I've got that. And that's good work. The 
question becomes, Senator King brought up an issue with the 
shooting in Lewiston, Maine, and how you guys were able to 
respond really quick. You were able to do that, I assume, 
because you've had a volunteer force ready to go in that 
region. Is that correct?
    Mr. Small. Yes, Senator. We do. I would defer to Mr. 
Jaastad. He can provide details on the DEMPS program.
    Chairman Tester. So the real question is, is that these 
folks are getting used more, and more, and more. We heard the 
testimony from Dr. Balbus. We see what's happened in the 
country from a disaster standpoint, whether it's man-made or 
nature made. And if you see burnout as a problem, we heard from 
Mr. Small, what else is being done so we make sure we got the 
people on the ground?
    Mr. Jaastad. Chairman Tester, indeed we did stress our 
DEMPS system. But, I think, it's also very important to note 
that our DEMPS volunteers have a warrior spirit and a servant's 
heart. Over the last year, we've added an additional 1,200 
volunteers to those ranks.
    When we look at applying lessons learned from COVID, we 
have to address our ability to respond to multiple events, 
whether it's hotspots, whether it's hurricanes, whether it's 
mass shootings, or wildfires. The CDT program, the Clinical 
Deployment Team program, was funded in January of last year. 
$85 million to hire 360 clinicians, 20 per VISN, 5 doctors, 11 
nurses, 2 social workers, and 2 LPNs.
    As a function of this cohort of FTE, they are eligible, or 
they are scheduled for possible deployment of 30 days twice a 
year. That's under the auspices of OEM. And so every month, I 
will have 60 providers ready to deploy in under 72 hours. This 
is a complementary program to the 12,000 DEMPS volunteers that 
are still active within our rosters.
    Chairman Tester. Okay. You're talking nationwide figures, 
right?
    Mr. Jaastad. Yes.
    Chairman Tester. Yes. So the question becomes in a more 
sparsely populated State like Maine or Montana. It worked in 
Maine. Do you feel that confident throughout the rest of the 
United States as far as availability of volunteer manpower?
    Mr. Jaastad. Volunteer manpower, yes.
    Chairman Tester. Okay. I lied. I got one more question. You 
got a cache program that was established after 9/11 because of 
what transpired on 9/11. We're two decades since 9/11, things 
have changed significantly. Can you speak to what you're doing 
to revisit the contents of those caches to make sure that they 
reflect our environment today?
    Mr. Jaastad. Chairman Tester, the cache program is managed 
by three separate program offices. The Office of Public Health, 
Emergency Pharmacy Services, and the Office of Emergency 
Management.
    Chairman Tester. And how often are you revisiting them, and 
are they being changed to reflect the challenges of today?
    Mr. Jaastad. We meet as co-chairs quarterly to review 
inspections. We are also a standing member on the Public Health 
Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise, hosted by HHS.
    Chairman Tester. And are the contents of those caches being 
changed? Have they changed significantly? Have they changed at 
all since 9/11?
    Mr. Jaastad. Actually, the PHEMCE, or Public Health 
Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise, works in 
conjunction with the CDC to do an annual report in terms of 
what we see as threats, what the SNS or Strategic National 
Stockpile has, and how the all-hazards emergency cache should 
complement that. And so, yes, we do make adjustments within the 
inventory.
    Chairman Tester. Within the inventory to reflect. Okay. 
Good enough. Senator Blumenthal.

                    HON. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL,
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT

    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for 
holding this very important hearing and apologies for being 
detained. I just want to say about this issue, it is so 
important in Connecticut where COVID caused many of our staff, 
the docs, the nurses, maintenance, to be burned out. But also 
what we've seen lately in terms of resiliency challenges, 
climate change and extreme weather causing flooding at our 
facilities--the West Haven facility--emphasizing, again, the 
importance of replacing that facility as is ongoing, new 
parking, new surgical unit around the way.
    But we need the investment in capital. And, I think, with 
all due respect, the President's been great to the VA, but I 
think the investment in capital still falls short of where it 
has to be to meet many of these emergencies that you've been 
discussing today.
    And I guess my question to you is what do you see as the 
priority in terms of the facilities, the structural 
sustainability? Where do you see as the main challenges that 
can be met by investment in the actual structures, the 
infrastructure, the facilities that the VA does?
    Mr. Small. Yes. Thank you, Senator. I will defer to my 
colleague in VHA to speak to the VHA medical facilities.
    Dr. Dorsey. Thank you for that question. I will say that 
the VA has just completed their climate vulnerability 
assessment. That was in 2023, and we're using this as a tool to 
really assess and evaluate the overall vulnerability of our VA 
assets.
    So we've looked at two different components. Our physical 
vulnerability, which is combines actually three different 
climate metrics. So exposure so the probability that a site may 
be susceptible to climate phenomenon, for example, sea level 
rise and flooding, sensitivity of that site to a climate-
related hazard, and then the adaptive capacity to be able to 
adapt to those situations.
    We've also taken a look at the social vulnerability of the 
population in that area. For example, socioeconomic status, 
housing characteristics, race, age, educational level, 
disability status. So we are using the results of this climate 
vulnerability assessment to really help inform deeper dives, 
and look at specific facilities and areas of concern, but also 
to make plans for our future infrastructure investments.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you.
    Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Tester. I want to thank our witnesses for being 
here today. I appreciate the--yes. Senator King, you may have 
the floor.
    Senator King. Mr. Balbus, first a story about your title. 
Deputy Assistant Secretary. I worked in this institution some 
years ago as a staff member, and I once called the Office of 
Management and Budget to seek a witness at a hearing. And the 
fellow said we'll send you, I think it was a deputy assistant 
secretary or a deputy undersecretary.
    And I said, well, I don't really know the titles. Can you 
tell me who this is? And the fellow gave me an answer--if I 
ever write a book about Washington, this will be the title--he 
said, ``He's at the highest level where they still know 
anything.'' That's you, Mr. Balbus.
    [Laughter.]
    Dr. Balbus. I'll take that one.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator King. I've come to realize that I'm now above that. 
The question I have is, in your title, Climate Change and 
Health Equity, do you see trends in terms of climate change 
affecting the frequency and severity of disasters? I mean, I 
realize you're not a climate scientist, but tell me about the 
relationship between climate change and things like the Maui 
wildfires, or flooding in the West, or severe hurricanes.
    Dr. Balbus. Well, absolutely. I mean, there's no doubt that 
we've seen substantial warming, for example, of the oceans, and 
the warmth of the ocean fuels the hurricanes. So we see much 
more rapid strengthening and intensity of the hurricanes that 
are hitting the Gulf Coast as one example. We're seeing more 
extremes of drought, which is partly why Maui experienced its 
devastating wildfire.
    So the trend line is very clear. In NOAA's billion-dollar 
disasters graph, many people have seen this, they keep having 
to actually change the y-axis because the number of billion-
dollar disasters keep setting records year after year in the 
last few years.
    Senator King. Could you get hold a copy of that and supply 
it to the Committee, please?
    Dr. Balbus. Absolutely.
    Senator King. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Tester. There is no doubt from a fiscal 
standpoint, we cannot continue to forward what's been going on 
from a disaster standpoint. We need to figure out common sense 
ways to get arms around this.
    Senator King. One suggestion that Senator Rubio and I are 
working on is funding preventive measures so that we're 
preventing the disaster, which is much more expensive to remedy 
than it is to prevent.
    Chairman Tester. That's 100 percent correct.
    Senator King. Thank you.
    Chairman Tester. I want to thank the witnesses today. I 
appreciate you being here. Now, you're seasoned Veterans. I 
appreciate the robust conversation around this topic. There 
were several questions that were asked for the record. I'd ask 
you to get them back in a timely manner. We will keep the 
record open for a week, and this hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 4:29 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
