   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM 
             OREGON, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON FINANCE

    The Chairman. The Senate Finance Committee will come to 
order.
    We are meeting today to discuss with Secretary Becerra the 
budget for the Department of Health and Human Services. The 
President's budget comes down to a simple proposition: helping 
working families and the middle class get ahead and reducing 
the Federal deficit are not mutually exclusive. So today, we 
are committed to doing both.
    When it comes to health care, that means protecting 
Medicare for the next generation by making sure that the 
wealthy pay their fair share in taxes; strengthening Medicare's 
negotiating power for the cost of prescription medicine; and 
investing in priorities like mental health care, home-based 
care, and the health-care workforce. That is a sharp contrast 
to the Republican approach to the Federal budget.
    Since the beginning of the year, there has basically been a 
demand for secret negotiations on unspecified cuts to Federal 
programs, while holding hostage the full faith and credit of 
the United States Government. Budget Committee Chair Whitehouse 
and I asked the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to run 
the numbers, and it is clear that Republican promises to spare 
certain parts of the budget like Social Security simply do not 
add up. Sparing essential lifelines for seniors in addition to 
Republican priorities means essentially zeroing out everything 
else in the Federal budget.
    I would like to take a moment to address press reports that 
some House members are considering proposals that cut earned 
benefits in Medicare or Social Security for those who are not 
yet at retirement age. I want to be clear. As long as I am 
chair of this committee, I will fight any effort to engage in 
intergenerational warfare. There are plenty of ideas to improve 
the financial health of these programs that do not include 
forfeiting the earned benefits of current workers.
    Now I am going to take a minute to talk about what that 
means in practical terms, starting with Medicaid. Contrary to 
popular belief, Medicaid acts as our country's backstop for 
nursing home care, not Medicare, and since my days as director 
of the Gray Panthers, I have been stunned at how many people 
still believe Medicare leads in the effort to fund nursing home 
care. That is just not accurate. It is Medicaid.
    That means when your parents are in their 80s and 90s and 
require nursing home care, Medicaid is there to help cover the 
costs once they have essentially gone through all the hard-
earned retirement savings and everything they did to try to 
plan for retirement while they were working. If Republicans go 
after Medicaid the way they did in 2017 by cutting Federal 
support to State Medicaid programs and giving States free reign 
to pare back benefits, that guaranteed backstop of nursing home 
care for seniors is ripped away.
    That means a return to times from distant memory before the 
social safety net was created, when older Americans who ran out 
of savings and could not count on a family member were 
essentially consigned to a poor farm. Nobody wants America to 
return to that time. So let us look for ways to work together 
to take on the big challenges of our time, rather than pursuing 
reckless cuts that imperil the country's older people.
    Now, a couple of important priorities in the President's 
budget--first on prescription drugs. The President's budget has 
several bold proposals to build on the Inflation Reduction Act 
that hold pharma accountable for years of high prices while 
lowering costs for seniors. That includes speeding up Medicare 
negotiations and increasing the number of drugs subject to 
negotiation. I strongly support this approach, especially as 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services continue to 
steadily implement the laws that are already on the books.
    For example, last week the Biden administration announced 
that the anti-price-gouging law that was written in this 
committee, in this room on a bipartisan basis in 2019, will 
lower coinsurance payment for 27 drugs in Medicare Part B. Part 
B pays for prescription drugs to treat diseases like cancer and 
rheumatoid arthritis administered in a physician's office. That 
includes Humira and, folks, Humira is Exhibit A for why drug 
pricing reforms were needed in the first place.
    Important steps like these coinsurance reductions, free 
vaccines, and the insulin cost cap in Medicare are just the 
beginning of the big league impact this law will have on 
Americans' health-care costs. I have said from the beginning 
that when the Federal Government leads on flagship health 
reforms in Medicare and in its key programs, we know as sure as 
the night follows the day that the private sector is going to 
follow, and that is exactly what is happening.
    Next, mental health care--very fitting, since my seatmate 
here has been the leader of that cause here in the Senate, 
Senator Stabenow. Last Congress, the committee wrote black 
letter law to move the country towards a reality where all 
Americans can get quality mental health care when and where 
they need it. I especially want to thank my partner here on the 
Finance Committee, Senator Crapo. At the beginning of 2021, we 
said on mental health care we were going to be ready on every 
single bill, every single one, to make sure that we advance the 
cause of mental health needs. And we were able to do that--on 
the gun safety law; with improved mental health care in 
schools; funding for community behavioral health centers led, 
as I mentioned, by Senator Stabenow; coverage for therapists in 
Medicare; and new GME slots for psychiatrists. Senator Crapo 
and I talk often about this, and we intend to continue our 
mental health work in this Congress, again in a bipartisan way.
    Now one final point with respect to mental health care, to 
clear up a little confusion. When it comes to mental health 
parity, the Congress passed a landmark law in 2008 based on the 
proposition that physical and mental health would be treated 
equally. That, unfortunately, does not happen today. Fifteen 
years after the law was written, the insurance companies, the 
big insurance companies, are still finding ways to drag their 
feet on carrying out the parity law with respect to mental 
health.
    So the challenge for the committee is to stop the foot-
dragging that is taking place under current law, colleagues--a 
2008 law--and develop fresh approaches to give Americans what 
they thought they were getting in 2008. The President's budget 
takes important steps in that direction, and I am pleased that 
Senator Bennet also is leading the way to put mental health 
care on a better footing.
    We are also pleased that the President's budget takes a big 
step when it comes to postpartum coverage for new mothers in 
Medicaid. At the end of last year, Congress came together on a 
bipartisan basis to create an option for every State to cover 
postpartum care for new mothers for 12 months. The President's 
budget, to its credit, takes the next step to make that 
coverage available for the country.
    Finally, I want to say I think all of us had a chance over 
the last few days to read a stunning report about cracks in the 
health-care system for disabled folks. It was reported on in 
The Washington Post. We are going to need to develop smarter 
policies that provide long-term care options for families to 
get the care that is best for them. One option is offered by 
our colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, for home and 
community-based services, and we are going to continue to 
promote that.
    So this is all about making some smart investments in 
better health for the people of this country, consistent with 
showing that you can do that while reducing the Federal budget 
deficit.
    After Senator Crapo has a chance to make his opening 
remarks, we will introduce Senator Becerra and we will get 
underway.
    Senator Crapo?

             OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE CRAPO, 
                   A U.S. SENATOR FROM IDAHO

    Senator Crapo. Thank you very much Mr. Chairman, and I 
thank you, Secretary Becerra, for being here today.
    Before we begin, let me let you know. I have to at this 
very time be introducing a judicial nominee for an Idaho 
district judge position. So, when I finish my remarks and I 
step out, I am not walking out on you. I will be back, and 
before I get to my prepared remarks, I do want to respond a 
little bit on the question about the debt ceiling negotiations.
    I want to make it very clear. The Republicans are asking 
for negotiations on the debt ceiling process, to add some 
fiscal restraint into the debt ceiling extension. I ask you, 
Secretary Becerra, to take back to the President my plea that 
he engage with us in negotiations. I want to make it clear. We 
are not talking about trying to reduce benefits in Medicare or 
Social Security for our seniors. What we are talking about is 
reasonable reforms that can help us get to some kind of fiscal 
restraint on our spiraling debt. I would just encourage all of 
my colleagues in the Senate, but particularly the President, to 
engage with us in those kinds of negotiations.
    I want to start my formal remarks on the positive. You have 
testified before and talked to me privately about the fact that 
although we have our differences on a lot of different policy 
areas, we want to find those areas where we can work together, 
and we found some last year. Last year, as Senator Wyden has 
already indicated, we came together on a package of bipartisan 
reforms to produce common-sense solutions, ranging from mental 
health improvements to comprehensive telehealth coverage for 
seniors and working families.
    Moreover, we accomplished all of this by reducing the 
deficits by billions of dollars, and the administration and 
you, Secretary Becerra, worked with us on this, and we have 
made good progress. I look forward to partnering with HHS, as 
well as with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to 
advance further reforms like this in this Congress, to improve 
health-care access, affordability, and choice for all 
Americans.
    That being said, I do have concerns with the budget that 
the President has put forward. Unfortunately, many of the 
proposals in the President's budget run directly counter to 
these types of initiatives that I have discussed. I have 
serious concerns with the focus on partisan policies that risk 
harming health-care access and affordability for both current 
and future patients. We talked about some of this yesterday.
    The budget's central proposal, for instance, would 
dramatically expand the size and scope of the bureaucratic 
government-run drug-pricing program enacted last year in the 
IRA. Prior to that law's passage, my Republican colleagues and 
I warned repeatedly that imposing sweeping price controls would 
prove disastrous for patients, biomedical research and 
development, and domestic manufacturing jobs, and many of our 
fears have already come to pass.
    We pointed to the risk of higher launch prices and 
distorted pricing practices based on projections validated by 
the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. And sure enough, 
The Wall Street Journal reported in January ``the impact in 
2023 may actually be higher drug prices.'' We also expressed 
concerns around lifesaving R&D, as a University of Chicago 
study estimated the IRA would result in 135 fewer new drug 
approvals in the next 2 decades.
    That figure would inevitably skyrocket under the budget's 
proposed expansion. Already, numerous manufacturers have 
signaled plans to table certain projects in light of the 
uncertainty created by the IRA. In recent months, we have also 
seen a rash of drug shortages, which even leading U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration officials have attributed to pricing 
dynamics. Doubling down on the IRA's price controls would 
exacerbate the law's most harmful consequences.
    Americans deserve better and more affordable access to 
prescription drugs, and we can find bipartisan results-oriented 
solutions to advance that goal. Government price mandates, 
however, are a step in the wrong direction. I also have 
profound concerns with the budget's bold claims of averting the 
Medicare hospital insurance trust fund's looming insolvency, 
largely through massive tax hikes and budget gimmicks.
    This unbalanced approach does nothing to address Medicare's 
cost drivers. It would also punish the small business job 
creators and entrepreneurs who drive our economy. 
Unfortunately, the budget takes a similarly shortsighted 
approach to Medicaid, reviving a number of rejected policies 
from past proposals, including hundreds of billions in new 
spending tied to burdensome conditions and efforts to 
circumvent State leaders.
    The Federal Government should focus on supporting States as 
they work to return Medicaid to post-pandemic normalcy, rather 
than imposing new top-down mandates. Instead of turning to a 
one-size-fits-all solution, we should look to proven models for 
Federal programs, such as Medicare Advantage. With sky-high 
patient satisfaction rates, Medicare Advantage shows that 
consumer choice and market forces can produce more benefits and 
better outcomes.
    As we move forward, I encourage your Department, Mr. 
Secretary, to focus on our shared goals, from cost-cutting 
competition to sustainable telehealth access and other similar 
issues, rather than on these partisan priorities.
    I thank you again for being here today, and I thank you, 
Mr. Chairman.
    [The prepared statement of Senator Crapo appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague, and my colleague and I 
are not going to go back and forth about who said what, when. I 
am just going to put into the record, by unanimous consent at 
this point, the House Republican Study Committee proposals * to 
cut Medicaid and Medicare. So specifically, that is what we are 
talking about.

    So, Secretary Becerra, we welcome you, the 25th Secretary 
of the Department of Health and Human Services, the first 
Latino to hold the office in the history of the United States. 
You have dedicated your career to public service, most recently 
serving as the Attorney General of California from 2017 to 
2021. Prior to that post, you served 12 terms in the Congress 
as a member of the House of Representatives.
    While serving in Congress, Secretary Becerra was the first 
Latino member of the Committee on Ways and Means. He served as 
ranking member of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social 
Security and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health.
    Mr. Secretary, we welcome you. I have appreciated the 
chance to work with you often over the years and appreciate 
your commitment to advocating for the people served by the 
Department of Health and Human Services. Go ahead with your 
remarks.

  STATEMENT OF HON. XAVIER BECERRA, SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF 
           HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, WASHINGTON, DC

    Secretary Becerra. Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo, 
and to all the members, thank you for the invitation.
    A lot has happened in the year since I last spoke to you 
about budgets. More than 16 million Americans have secured 
health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. 
That is an all-time high. Altogether, more than 300 million 
Americans now carry insurance to cover their health-care needs, 
a historic high as well.
    The President's new lower-cost prescription drug law has 
capped insulin at $35 per month and made preventative vaccines 
like the flu, COVID, and shingles vaccines available for free 
under Medicare. Moving forward, this new law gives us the right 
to finally negotiate lower prescription drug prices for 
Americans. And to cap it all off, the Biden-Harris 
administration has safely and effectively executed the largest 
adult vaccine program in U.S. history, achieving nearly 700 
million shots in arms during the COVID pandemic without charge.
    The Fiscal Year 2024 budget proposes $144 billion in 
discretionary funding and $1.7 trillion in mandatory funding 
for HHS. It positions us to tackle the urgent challenges we 
face, including a growing behavioral health crisis and future 
public health threats. It also funds operations in mission-
critical infrastructure needed to build a healthier America, 
moving the Nation from an illness care system to a wellness 
care system.
    An illness care system leaves our most vulnerable families 
behind. A wellness care system invests in providing the full 
spectrum of health care to all Americans. Illness care allows 
the price of prescription drugs to skyrocket. Wellness care 
starts by prescribing fruits, vegetables, and exercise; it 
treats food as medicine. Illness care requires you to get a 
referral by your family physician to see a specialist for 
mental health services. Wellness care--well, it lets you get 
mental health care the moment you walk through the door of your 
family physician's office.
    Illness care forces hardworking Americans to deplete their 
life savings to get the long-term care they need. Wellness 
care, it invests early in long-term care, like in-home care, so 
our older American adults and our Americans with disabilities 
can thrive at home and in their communities.
    Our budget invests in wellness care. We invest more than 
$30 billion to prepare us for the next COVID or public health 
crisis, including the billion dollars to replenish our Nation's 
strategic national stockpile.
    On behavioral health, too many of our loved ones are dying 
from suicide or overdose, so we increase access to crisis care. 
We grow the behavioral health workforce, and we beef up 
substance use services. We are also gearing up to handle more 
than 6 million additional contacts from people who are 
experiencing a mental health crisis, through 988, the 3-digit 
suicide prevention lifeline we stood up last year.
    This budget covers 2 million adults left out by Medicaid by 
their home States and extends tax credits that make health care 
more affordable for millions of Americans. It would also ensure 
that expanded postpartum Medicaid coverage for a new mom and 
her baby is here to stay. The President's budget not only 
strengthens Medicare for today's seniors but protects and 
strengthens it for the next generation.
    We also take care of our family members in this budget, 
investing $600 billion in child care and preschool programs, 
and $150 billion to strengthen Medicaid home and community-
based services. This budget funds the Cancer Moonshot and ARPA-
H. It invests in the title X family planning program essential 
to so many of our families, and it delivers on our commitments 
made as part of the National Strategy for Hunger, Nutrition, 
and Health. It opens more community health centers and--
important to me as a former Attorney General--it bolsters our 
health-care fraud and abuse detection and enforcement work.
    And the President's budget honors our responsibilities to 
Indian country, with more than $2 billion in new resources in 
2024. Last year for the first time, you gave the Indian Health 
Service advanced appropriations, providing the same protection 
against budget uncertainty that other health services receive. 
We hope to build on that progress this year.
    This budget reflects the President's and our values and 
commitments. It helps to begin the move from a Nation focused 
on illness care to one about wellness care. And importantly, it 
ensures health and wellness are within the reach for all 
Americans.
    On behalf of the women and men of the Department of Health 
and Human Services, we look forward to working with you, and I 
thank you for having me today.
    [The prepared statement of Secretary Becerra appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. Mr. Secretary, thank you. I will start it off 
with respect to the trust fund. Now, the President and 
Democrats are committed to protecting what we have always 
called Medicare's guarantee. Medicare is not some kind of 
voucher. It is a guarantee of high-quality health care, and 
Americans have earned this benefit with each paycheck.
    So, with this budget, the President is focused on making 
sure billionaires and the very wealthy pay their fair share. It 
would strengthen Medicare's negotiating authority and lower the 
price of more prescription drugs and extend Medicare's solvency 
for 25 years. Now what we are hearing from the other side is 
giving a free pass to billionaires. All these budgets work it 
out so that billionaires basically are left untouched. And now 
we are seeing the full faith and credit of the United States 
being threatened.
    So, what I would like to do is make sure that you have a 
chance to make it clear what the differences are with respect 
to these issues. The President's budget, in my view, does not 
cut Medicare benefits by taking steps like raising the 
eligibility age, reducing access to care, or basically just 
handing everything over to a bunch of big insurance companies. 
Is that factually, correct?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, the President made it very 
clear he will not propose any budget that cuts benefits under 
Medicare for the 67 million people who today count on Medicare, 
and to the millions more who are added every year. He would in 
fact increase benefits at the same time that he is 
strengthening the program for the future generations to come.
    So, it is a proposal that was due because so many 
Presidents have come before President Biden and never offered a 
proposal. I, for 24 years in Congress, never saw Congress try 
to tackle this in a serious way. Finally, we have a President 
who says, ``Here is how we do it, and we can not only 
strengthen Medicare, but we can do it without cutting one 
benefit for any senior in America.''
    The Chairman. All right.
    Let us move on to prescription drugs and the implementation 
of the Inflation Reduction Act. And I think you heard me 
mention right here in this room with Senator Grassley--Senator 
Stabenow was here, Senator Crapo was here. That is where we 
locked in the first-ever set of financial penalties for pricing 
gouging in Medicare. We saw the benefits of this this week, 
with the reduction in coinsurance that is going to be of help 
to millions of people. That was done in 2019 in this room, in a 
bipartisan way. So we want to keep building on that.
    CMS is working on a tight timeline with respect to the drug 
pricing reforms, and there is a lot to do in advance of the 
September 1st announcement of which 10 drugs will be the first 
to go forward on the negotiation process. Last week, as I 
indicated, was an important milestone with the release of the 
proposed Medicare price negotiation guidance. This is in 
addition to the implementation of the penalties for price 
gouging, and you and I have talked about that.
    It is so important that the Inflation Reduction Act 
guidelines are met, and we ensure that the people who are 
participating in this program are ready and that the law 
delivers for seniors and the public. So my first question to 
you--and you and I have talked about this--is, is it possible 
for you today to commit to a timely release of the final 
negotiation guidance which would come about this summer?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, that is our goal. We have never 
done this before. We thank you for the resources to try to do 
it right. We understand that September is a magical date when 
we announce the 10 drugs that would be part of the first 
negotiation. We will continue to work with you. I am committed 
to make sure that each and every member in the Senate and the 
House has the information they need to see where we are going, 
and because you were gracious in giving us the resources to 
staff up, we hope to not only meet the deadlines, but hopefully 
beat them.
    The Chairman. We look forward to working with you, really 
month by month, to meet this September deadline. You and I have 
talked about this before. This was an extraordinary victory for 
the millions of seniors who would stand in those pharmacy lines 
and feel like they were getting mugged by the prices. Pharma, 
you know, protected this ban on negotiation like they were 
protecting the holy grail. Senator Stabenow and so many others 
kept making the case.
    Of course you ought to negotiate. There are more than 50 
million seniors on Medicare. Who in the world does not 
negotiate? So last week's announcements were very good with 
respect to price gouging, with respect to the list for 
negotiation. We are moving ahead to make sure this gets 
implemented. Tell me a little bit about what the American 
people can expect to be told as this goes forward and how it 
impacts them, and I will yield to my colleagues.
    Secretary Becerra. Mr. Chairman, I believe we are going to 
not only be transparent with you and your colleagues, but with 
the American public, about how we are going about selecting 
those drugs, the process in which we are going to engage the 
manufacturers in this. We want them to be able to participate 
as much as possible in a public setting, so people can see how 
they behave in this process of negotiation and let the American 
people see. Sunshine is the best disinfectant, as they say, and 
we have no problem with that.
    The Chairman. Very good; thank you.
    Senator Stabenow will be next.
    Senator Stabenow. Thank you very much, and welcome, Mr. 
Secretary. There are so many different things we can talk about 
that are so important and are making a difference in people's 
lives. And thank you, and thank the President for doing what 
you are doing.
    First, I do want to recognize, I have a lot of friends in 
purple shirts here from the Alzheimer's Association, and we 
want to celebrate, I think over the years now, something like a 
700-percent increase in research, which is so critical, and 
efforts we have done to support caregivers. And the next step 
is making sure that patients have the critical and urgent 
treatments that they need.
    And so, I will be following up with you more on that, but 
this is the moment to really delve into that, and so I 
appreciate that they are all here with us this week.
    Let me start also by saying that Medicare and Social 
Security are great American success stories that lifted a 
generation of seniors and people with disabilities out of 
poverty. We certainly are not going to go backwards; at least 
certainly the majority in the United States Senate is not going 
to go backwards.
    When the chairman talks about the House Republican study 
group budget, which has been lifted up as a major foundation 
for what the House is talking about, it raises the age of 
Medicare to 70, raises the age of Social Security to 70. I 
cannot imagine doing that or privatizing the systems, turning 
them over to Wall Street or private insurance companies. So I 
congratulate you, and I congratulate the President for going in 
a different direction, which is to strengthen Medicare and to 
focus on the costs of prescription drugs and so on as we move 
things in the right direction for people.
    You know I have to talk about mental health. I have to talk 
about Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics. I am so 
excited that this is something that we have done on a 
bipartisan basis. I see Senator Cornyn here. We worked really 
hard together on the Safer Communities Act, and really have the 
most, the strongest investment in mental health and addiction 
services literally in 50 years, and that is not an 
exaggeration. So, thank you for working on that, as well as our 
chairman and ranking member, who have been so pivotal in all of 
it.
    We have had a demonstration project with 10 States fully 
funded--like health care, with clinics, quality clinics, 24-
hour emergency services. We are now working on the next piece. 
You announced SAMHSA has the process for identifying the next 
10 States. We want to get that all the way to 50. But I would 
like you to elaborate a little more on your plans for this 
really transformative system. We are moving from grants; grants 
are good, but it's much better to have this be an integral part 
of our health-care system with ongoing funding and support, 
support for staff through work that this committee did in 
expanding Medicare access for therapists, and so on. And GME 
slots for psychiatrists at the end of the year--really 
important work that we have done.
    But could you expand a little bit on this program and the 
vision around community behavioral health?
    Secretary Becerra. Yes. And I have to begin, Senator, by 
thanking you, Senator Cornyn, and others who really championed 
this. Your fingerprints are all over this expansion of 
Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, and thank God, 
because we know that mental illness does not end at 5 o'clock. 
It goes forward at midnight, 3:00 in the morning. You need to 
have someone you can turn to, and that is where these Certified 
Community Behavioral Health Clinics will be indispensable.
    The fact is that we are going to try to give them a 
permanent stream of funding so they are not open just 9:00 to 
5:00, or they are not open just the first 5 months of the year 
and then they run out of money. This has a consistency, and we 
know that, for folks who are going through a mental health 
crisis, they are looking for some stability. And so this helps 
add that at all hours, all days in the year, and we are going 
to build on this.
    You started with a project, a pilot, and now you see what 
is happening. And it is great that we are also going to be able 
to help those States that start off in those projects to expand 
as well, because what a shame if the States that first took the 
lead and showed its success would be deprived of the chance to 
expand. So, thank you very much to you and your colleagues for 
what you have done.
    Senator Stabenow. Well, I am really thrilled that in the 
President's budget, he makes the Certified Community Behavioral 
Health Clinics permanent, which is so critical. And I have to 
say this was a major bipartisan accomplishment. And while he is 
no longer in the Senate, my partner, Senator Roy Blunt, was 
integral to this. And so, a shout-out to Senator Blunt as well.
    So, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    Next will be Senator Crapo. The next three--it is a very 
hectic day up here, Mr. Secretary, as you know on Wednesdays. 
At this point, the next three in order of appearance would be 
Grassley, Menendez, and Cornyn.
    So next is Senator Crapo.
    Senator Crapo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    And I think I will start out with Alzheimer's. As Senator 
Stabenow mentioned, we have a number of our Alzheimer's friends 
here with us today. The FDA's accelerated approval pathway has 
provided a lifeline for countless Americans, advancing access 
to safe and effective medicines for cancers, rare diseases, 
HIV, and other conditions like Alzheimer's, years before these 
treatments could otherwise come to the market.
    Unfortunately, this administration has taken unprecedented 
steps to erode this pathway, deterring lifesaving innovation 
and delaying access to care. This troubling trend began with 
CMS's coverage restrictions for an entire class of Alzheimer's 
therapies, and it seems set to continue with the recently 
announced Accelerating Clinical Evidence Model, which would 
slash payments for treatments that rely on accelerated 
approval.
    Secretary Becerra, I recently led a letter urging the 
administration to abandon this misguided model, given the 
potential for slower and slimmer pipelines of new medicines for 
seniors, among other serious conditions. I also wrote to you 
last year about the grave implications of the Alzheimer's 
coverage decision. How does your department plan to ensure that 
accelerated approval pathways remain a robust and viable option 
for innovators, and most importantly for patients?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator Crapo, you have touched on 
something very important for me, having my father, my father-
in-law and mother-in-law with dementia in the last years, last 
months of life. Very tough. We were there. My father died in my 
home. We cared for him. Same with my mother-in-law and father-
in-law. My wife and her siblings cared for them. This is tough. 
Dementia--it is all of us, not just the patient, and we want to 
be there.
    We are fortunate that in America we are coming up with new, 
innovative treatments, and we are doing everything we can to 
accelerate them. I give you the evidence of the COVID vaccine. 
No one expected that the COVID vaccine would come out so 
quickly. Whether it is Alzheimer's, COVID, hepatitis C, we are 
moving and we want to be there, and we will look for every 
innovative approach, every pathway possible to make sure that, 
one, we can put a safe and effective drug in front of the 
American people, and then also determine whether it will be 
covered by Medicare.
    Senator Crapo. Well, I understand that commitment. But the 
accelerated model that you have adopted or are looking to adopt 
and pursue is going in exactly the opposite direction. I 
encourage you to revisit this model.
    Let me move on to Medicare Advantage. CMS recently released 
their annual advance notice, which included some significant 
changes to the Medicare Advantage risk model for the upcoming 
bid process. We have heard concerns from providers, patients, 
and plans that these changes will disproportionately impact the 
most vulnerable MA beneficiaries, including those with low 
incomes or chronic conditions. Mr. Secretary, does the 
administration plan to address these concerns in its final MA 
rule?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, thanks for the question. Half 
of all seniors who have Medicare use the Medicare managed care 
model. This is critically important. We are absolutely going to 
make sure that when the final gavel falls on this, it will not 
only move us in the right direction with more efficiency, but 
it also will protect every Medicare beneficiary, seniors, and 
disabled Americans who use the Medicare program.
    Senator Crapo. Well, thank you. And I encourage you to look 
at this carefully, and if you have not already done it, to 
conduct an impact analysis, to determine how the model you are 
currently considering changes to would affect different groups 
of beneficiaries. I think you will find that, once again, these 
proposals are going in the wrong direction.
    Let me move on to one where we can agree. That is on 
telehealth. As the budget request mentions, my colleagues and I 
came together late last year to advance a crucial 2-year 
extension of wide-ranging telehealth flexibilities, including 
for Medicare beneficiaries. Without further action, however, 
these policies will expire at the end of 2024, creating a 
coverage cliff for tens of millions of seniors across the 
country.
    Secretary Becerra, I realize this requires Congress to get 
engaged and involved. But from the administration's 
perspective, how should Medicare telehealth coverage look in 
the longer term, and can you commit to working with Congress to 
develop meaningful solutions that will protect access well 
beyond the end of next year?
    Secretary Becerra. Yes, Senator, this one is crucial. We 
absolutely will work with you, because we do not want those 
statutory flexibilities to expire. We are going to need your 
help. Thank you for the leadership you have demonstrated over 
the past on this one. We, for example, want to make sure that 
everyone has the broadband that will make telehealth work. We 
want to make sure that everyone can use a doctor wherever that 
doctor is located. This requires the States to work with us to 
make sure we can cross State borders.
    We want to make sure that if you are in rural America or 
inner-city America, you do not have to worry that you do not 
have a way to get to the doctor. You will have access through 
telehealth.
    Senator Crapo. Well, thank you. And encourage us as 
strongly as you can to get that legislatively done. I know 
Senator Wyden and I are working very closely together on this, 
and I just want some strong support from the administration.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Crapo. And you are right: 
we are working together on a number of these issues. I just 
want very quickly, before we go to Senator Grassley, to say we 
very much appreciate having Alzheimer's advocates in the house 
today.
    My mother was at Channing House in Palo Alto for years and 
years on end with Alzheimer's, and they were one of the 
country's--and continue to be one of the country's leading 
institutions in terms of dementia care and Alzheimer's. So you 
are hearing from all of us up here that we are committed to 
working with you.
    The other point I wanted to mention involves the medicines, 
the drugs. That is, I am a very strong supporter of accelerated 
approval for these very exciting new drugs for Alzheimer's. My 
colleague and seat mate, Senator Stabenow--I am still trying to 
persuade her to not retire--is leading the cause in terms of 
these new medicines.
    It is just very important to remember what was agreed to 
originally, and that was, when you have accelerated approval so 
we can make sure we are keeping our commitments to these 
patients, it would be followed up by the drug companies 
presenting evidence of the progress with respect to how the 
drugs are working on patients and working with patients.
    That was part of the accelerated pathway in 1992. So I want 
all the folks who are doing this wonderful work advocating for 
patients to know, we are going to support you. We are going to 
look for research, we are going to look for new medicines. The 
accelerated approval is part of it, and the pharmaceutical 
companies have agreed, after the drug is approved, to continue 
to furnish evidence of its progress. That is very important. 
Mr. Secretary, you remember that was what Dr. Califf agreed to 
with me when we were considering his nomination.
    Senator Grassley?
    Senator Grassley. Thank you very much and--two thank yous. 
First of all, you very quickly instituted the over-the-counter 
hearing aid, the hearing aid law that Senator Warren and I 
sponsored. I also want to thank you for enabling the transition 
health plans to continue, because 65,000 Iowans are benefiting 
from that action, and many of these people are farmers and 
small business owners. Letting them continue has been a 
bipartisan priority under Presidents Obama, Trump, and now 
Biden. So I hope HHS allows them to continue in the future 
beyond 2024.
    Now let me go to my first question. Members of this 
committee, including this Senator, are investigating the deadly 
failures of our Nation's organ donation system, the Organ 
Procurement and Transplantation Network. I have been looking 
into this network a long, long period of time. The problems 
have gotten worse. Thousands of patients are dying every year, 
and billions of taxpayer dollars are wasted because of gross 
mismanagement. The system is rife with fraud, waste and abuse, 
corruption, and even criminality. This committee has received 
credible allegations regarding the United Network for Organ 
Sharing, relating to that organization threatening 
whistleblowers, including even patients and caregivers.
    Simply put, this is beyond unacceptable. These efforts 
appear to be part of an attempt to cover up failures and 
prevent competition for its government contract. So, a question 
to you: I hope that you can commit to fully investigating all 
instances of whistleblower retaliation and harassment. Would 
the HHS commit to removing anyone involved in that improper 
conduct from any involvement in the Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network leadership and committees? If you do 
not agree with me, why not?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator Grassley, first, thank you for 
the work that you have done. As you mentioned, this has taken a 
long time, and thank God that you have committed to it. On the 
whistleblower question, we are absolutely committed to working 
with you to make sure that if there is a claim made about a 
particular operation, we dive right into it to find out what is 
going on.
    Let me give you the more important news. Today we are 
announcing at HHS that we are going to put forward a 
modernization initiative, which will do a number of things that 
I think you are going to like. One, we are going to call for 
competition in who becomes the contractor for these organ 
procurements and the transplant services, and so it will no 
longer be just one company the way it has been for what, 40 
years? So that is one big change that will occur.
    Secondly, we are going to require transparency. They have 
got to start sharing their data. They cannot hide, as you just 
said, behind this confidentiality and say, ``We cannot show you 
what is going on because it is confidential.'' We are going to 
require far more data transparency. Again, this follows all the 
work that you have done.
    Then finally, we are going to try to upgrade the IT system 
which, as you can imagine with these contractors never having 
changed--everything gets stale; so does the IT.
    We are going to try to update the IT so we can be efficient 
with those organs that we receive, so we can get them to 
someone, instead of have them ultimately be discarded because 
they did not get used in time. Those are things we are 
announcing today, and in the President's budget, he calls for 
resources so we can implement this. So we are absolutely going 
to call on you for your help to try to move this forward, get 
your input. But again, much of what we are announcing today is 
a result of the work that you have done over the years.
    Senator Grassley. Thank you for your initiative.
    I want to turn to rural health care. I want to thank the 
administration for implementing the new and voluntary Rural 
Emergency Hospital program that I have worked for 3 or 4 years 
to get passed. Another rural hospital program that you may not 
know so much about is called the Rural Community Hospital 
Demonstration. It extends the financial viability of 26 small 
rural hospitals in 11 different States, five in Iowa.
    The program has taken up to 30 hospitals. But CMS is 
currently underutilizing the program. Congress has authorized 
the program for several more years. While there is interest in 
rural hospital participation, CMS has told me that they have no 
interest in filling the four additional slots. I realize that 
you may not know much about this program. Do you think that we 
should be underutilizing cost-effective rural hospital programs 
like the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, I am familiar with the program, 
and we are making a concerted effort in rural America to inject 
some life into some of these facilities, because as you know 
very well, too many of them are closing, and they are not being 
replaced. When they are being replaced, they are first being 
gutted of some of the essential services that they used to 
provide. So we have dedicated services into rural community 
hospitals.
    But we are going to try to do more, and we certainly will 
take your lead on some of these initiatives, because we know 
that those of you who go back home every day and have to deal 
with those providers know exactly what they need and where they 
need to go. So we will look forward to working with you.
    Senator Grassley. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, and thank you, 
Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. While he is in the room, let me thank Senator 
Grassley for working in such a bipartisan way over the years to 
improve the system with respect to organs and organ 
procurement. Yesterday, there was, in my view, a big victory 
for families across the country who have been fighting for more 
effective organ procurement and transportation system. The 
administration indicated they would work with us to have more 
competition in this UNOS contract.
    This committee has felt, on a bipartisan basis, that there 
has not been enough competition for the contract and meeting 
the expectations of Americans waiting for transplants. So I 
want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Senator 
Grassley in particular has been at this for years, and I look 
forward to working closely with him.
    Senator Menendez is next.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, 
before I go to my questions, I just simply want to say, I want 
to echo your comments as someone whose mother had a 10-year-
long goodbye with Alzheimer's. We have a moral, as well as an 
economic imperative to end Alzheimer's in our time, and so I 
hope the budget will reflect that as well.
    Mr. Secretary, for years communities across the country 
have struggled to fill major provider workforce gaps, a growing 
crisis exacerbated by the pandemic. I have long championed 
legislation to address the physician shortage by increasing the 
number of 
Medicare-funded graduate medical education slots, and based on 
my legislation, the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act, 
Congress authorized the creation of 1,000 new Medicare-funded 
GME slots in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021.
    It outlines specific eligibility criteria for distributing 
these slots. However, the kingdom of CMS, in its final rule for 
2022 and again in 2023, included additional criteria not 
specified in the law. This additional location-specific 
prioritization unfairly disadvantages States that have few 
geographic or population HPSAs. As a result, in New Jersey and 
other States, we are completely, completely shut out from 
obtaining these critical residency positions.
    The CAA of 2021 clearly specifies that ``the Secretary 
shall,'' not may, ``shall distribute up to 200 residency 
positions each year and shall distribute not less than 10 
percent of the residency positions to each of four specified 
categories of providers.'' That is the law. That is what 
Congress's intent was. Now, I raised this with CMS last year. 
They failed to address this issue.
    Can I have your commitment to work with me to revise the 
methodology used to distribute future residency positions so 
that we follow Congress's intent and the law, and that States 
are not totally shut out of this program?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, first, thank you very much for 
the work you have done on graduate medical education, and 
absolutely, you have my commitment to work with you on this.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you. Now, I am concerned that the 
proposed advance notice Medicare Advantage rate announcement 
will create further health disparities for the 640,000 Medicare 
Advantage beneficiaries in Puerto Rico. As you know, Puerto 
Rico seniors overwhelmingly depend on the MA program, with an 
MA penetration rate of 94 percent among beneficiaries eligible 
for Medicare Parts A and B.
    The proposed changes could impose the largest year-to-year 
reduction in Federal health funding to Puerto Rico, a change 
that is harmful not only to the most vulnerable beneficiaries, 
but to the island's health-care system and economy, one that we 
have been working towards improving. This is going to set them 
back. Further, the MA program in Puerto Rico supports health 
access and equity by filling gaps in care resulting from the 
island's exclusion from many of the Federal health benefits.
    I am concerned these changes could undermine progress we 
have made to date to address disparities on the island, 
including recent funding gains achieved for the Medicaid 
program, which I fought for. What is the administration's plan 
to ensure any proposed changes are not magnifying disparities 
and reducing services provided to beneficiaries on the island 
who are United States citizens?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, thank you for the question, and 
as we mentioned earlier, when 67 million people count on 
Medicare, about half of them count on it within the managed 
care program of Medicare. We have to make sure we get it right. 
We are in the process of reviewing all the comments that we 
received based on that advance notice, and what the President 
said is, we will guarantee that there will be no cuts to the 
benefits under Medicare in this proposal, that the providers 
will see in most cases an increase--a substantial increase in 
some cases--to the reimbursement monies they are receiving----
    Senator Menendez. Yes, and this is--with all due respect, 
this is in the broader context. But you've got to look at 
Puerto Rico specifically in the disproportionate way it gets 
affected. So I am worried that while we are talking broadly, 
the effect in Puerto Rico for the 3.5 million United States 
citizens is disproportionate. So I am going to follow up with a 
letter regarding Medicare Advantage in Puerto Rico, urging you 
to address anomalies in the rate formula to mitigate funding 
disparities for the island.
    Secretary Becerra. I look forward to that.
    Senator Menendez. Finally, last month The New York Times 
published a disturbing report on the illegal use of migrant 
child labor by several major companies. Some as young as 13-
year-olds are unaccompanied minors who came to the United 
States and were placed with sponsors by the Office of Refugee 
Resettlement. They are often made to work long hours in 
hazardous conditions. What are we doing to make sure that that 
does not happen again?
    Secretary Becerra. And, Senator, like you, I have three 
daughters. Children are children. We should treat every child 
in America the way we would expect to have our children 
treated. It is a serious issue when someone claims that a child 
is being forced to work, especially in dangerous conditions. We 
take very seriously our role at HHS to make sure that while we 
have custody of a child--and remember, we receive custody of 
these unaccompanied migrant kids from the Department of 
Homeland Security.
    When we do, we are obligated to provide them with the care 
that you would expect for a child, while we are in the process 
of trying to find them a suitable setting to live in, because a 
large congregant care setting is not the most ideal for any 
child. And so we go through the process of trying to look for a 
sponsor. We go through a vetting process where we vet all 
potential sponsors. And by the way, almost all--about 90 
percent of those sponsors--end up being a family member, an 
immediate family member.
    And so what we try to do is make sure that when we do 
finally place that child in the hands of a sponsor, that they 
will receive the care that they are supposed to. What we are 
finding is that, oftentimes, a lot of these children are now 
being employed, and I hope that we go aggressively--you, we--
all go aggressively at any employer that would think that it is 
right to allow a 12- or 13-year-old to work in conditions that 
are not even safe for adults.
    That is where we have to go and make sure that we are not 
failing children, and that is why we announced that in a joint 
effort, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health 
and Human Services will work to try to make sure that we can do 
what we can within our jurisdiction to avoid that happening. At 
HHS, that means trying to get sight from DOL if they know of a 
particular individual who is seeking to be a sponsor, who may 
be engaged in the practice of using or employing, or allowing 
kids to be employed, in ways that are detrimental to them.
    We are going to try to do the best we can to make sure we 
have that fight early, so that no sponsor like that would ever 
pass our vetting process.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague, and I want my colleague 
to know I appreciate his leadership, and I especially want to 
help with that last point that you made. This is outrageous, 
that companies are exploiting 12-year-olds. In order to make a 
quick buck, they are taking advantage of these kids. It is 
outrageous, and I look forward to working with you and 
following your lead.
    Senator Cornyn?
    Senator Cornyn. Thank you.
    Mr. Secretary, last year, approximately 108,000 Americans 
died of drug overdoses, including 71,000 roughly from synthetic 
opioids like fentanyl. Do you believe we have a public health 
crisis when it comes to these overdose deaths?
    Secretary Becerra. Absolutely; absolutely.
    Senator Cornyn. And one reason why we have this public 
health crisis--which you and I both recognize as such--is 
because we have lost control of our southern border. We have 
seen millions of people show up, some claiming asylum, some 
being placed--like unaccompanied children--through your offices 
with sponsors in the interior. And of course the asylum system 
now essentially is a free pass into the interior of the United 
States, and due to the backlog in the immigration court system, 
many of these cases will never be reached, assuming people 
actually show up for their immigration court hearing in the 
future, with very little consequences for failing to do so.
    As you know, title 42, which is the public health title 
that was implemented because of COVID, will expire in May. I 
would like for you to tell us what the administration's plan is 
to deal with this public health crisis and this humanitarian 
crisis caused by the lack of any controls at our border?
    Secretary Becerra. And, Senator, I will try to concentrate 
my comments on the work that we are doing at HHS, and I will 
let my colleagues speak to the work that they are doing, for 
example, at the Department of Homeland Security and others, on 
other aspects of this.
    Senator Cornyn. Well, I would like to know what the plan 
is. I assume you have been consulted and collaborate on that 
plan. But so far, we have not seen anything that is credible in 
terms of dealing with this, and as bad as it is now, which has 
never been worse when it comes to the flow of drugs and people 
across our border, it will get worse if title 42 expires and 
there is not an adequate plan put in its place to deal with 
both the flow of drugs and people.
    Secretary Becerra. Yes, and to your point, because we are 
having to work under a very broken immigration system, as you 
mentioned, these are the things that happen. I know that, for 
example, the Department of Homeland Security has tried to move 
the asylum process in a way that lets us get to these cases 
quicker and adjudicate them, so that way we can move through 
that process.
    But in terms of HHS, we continue to try to be prepared, 
because we do not know who will cross that border as a child 
who is unaccompanied and when we will have to be ready to 
secure them from DHS within 72 hours, so they can be in an 
appropriate setting. So what we are doing is preparing for 
whatever the eventual outcome is, to make sure that we respect 
the rights of any child to receive care that is essential, and 
we are going to continue to do that at HHS.
    Senator Cornyn. Well, Mr. Secretary, I will just give you 
one person's opinion. I think the Biden administration has 
completely dropped the ball when it comes to the border, and 
unfortunately, we have seen all of these deaths. I went 
recently to a high school right outside of Austin, where I 
live, and talked to the parents who have lost young people who 
thought they were taking something relatively innocuous, but it 
was laced with fentanyl. And as you know, the cartels use 
industrial-type pill presses to make what looks like a normal 
pharmaceutical product, but in fact it is tainted with 
fentanyl, which, as you know, is extraordinarily powerful, and 
small amounts will kill.
    I want to just say the one thing I would congratulate the 
Biden administration on is their commitment to implement the 
bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Senator Stabenow acknowledged 
one of the most important parts of that bill that Senator 
Tillis and Senator Sinema and Senator Murphy and I were 
involved in, and actually all of our colleagues were involved 
in, in one way or the other.
    But we made the single largest investment in community-
based mental health care in American history, and I think that 
is something we are all going to be very proud of and will 
address a huge unmet need.
    But the last thing I want to say in the few seconds I have 
is just to ask for your help. Senator Menendez talked about the 
workforce shortages. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the 
mental health and physical health delivery systems.
    We tend to focus, like through a soda straw, on 
reimbursement rates, because the Federal Government is trying 
to figure out how can we cut health-care costs, make it more 
affordable. But we have a confluence of problems when it comes 
to recruiting and retaining health-care professionals. We have 
erosion of the standards for providing those professional 
services through scope-of-practice issues.
    I would like to ask if you will be willing to work with 
us--particularly the chairman, the ranking member, who 
obviously will set the agenda--in working on all of these 
issues as part of the same problem, as opposed to dealing just 
with the reimbursement issues in isolation.
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, we will look forward to hearing 
from your staff so we can follow up with you. This is 
absolutely something the President has asked us to follow up 
and work on. The President does dedicate monies to workforce 
expansion and development and also resilience. So we will look 
forward to working with you on this.
    Senator Cornyn. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Cornyn, thank you again for your 
leadership, your ongoing leadership on these mental health 
issues, and I think there are some more opportunities, 
particularly for public-private partnerships. In our part of 
the world Connie and Steve Ballmer have funded behavioral 
health studies at the University of Oregon. I think it is going 
to be a model for the country to get more workers.
    Senator Cornyn. Mr. Chairman, as you know, it was the 
product mainly of this committee, the Finance Committee, that 
made that possible as part of the bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act. So, thank you for your leadership, as well as that of 
Senator Crapo. I think that is a big deal.
    The Chairman. To be continued. You are absolutely right.
    Next will be Senator Cardin.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Becerra, 
welcome. It is good to see you.
    I want to underscore the point of Senator Grassley in 
regards to the organ transplant issues. The reform of the OPTN 
process will save lives. We lose 17 Americans every day 
awaiting an organ transplant. So this is an urgent issue, and I 
just thank you for your response and the actions that you are 
taking.
    I want to turn to the issue of drug shortages. We are the 
wealthiest Nation in the world that spends the most of any 
nation on drugs, and yet we have important drugs that are in 
short supply here. According to the American Society of Health-
System Pharmacists, 160 drugs were added in 2022 to the drug 
shortage list. Forty-eight percent were in sterile injections, 
making a total of 295 active drug shortages here in the United 
States. These are drugs that are critically important to your 
health care. Some are in cancer treatments and other areas. So 
the President's budget deals with extending expiration dates, 
which I think is important.
    Senator Collins and I have introduced legislation on that 
to deal with disclosure. How do you intend to mitigate this 
challenge that we have in this country?
    Secretary Becerra. You know, Senator, I am glad you raised 
this because, whether it was the issue of infant formula or 
whether it was the winter flu, we are seeing that in so many 
cases, the industries that we count on to provide us effective 
medications are not ready for disruptions, for a broadside. 
That is because we have gotten into a system where these 
industries, to save money--and they are entitled to try to save 
money--have gone towards a supply chain methodology that 
essentially says we are going to keep in inventory only the 
stock that we need immediately.
    If all of a sudden you have a major increase in demand, you 
cannot meet it. Or if something happens with a manufacturer 
that has to go down because there is an issue of safety or 
cleanliness, then all of a sudden the supply goes down, and 
they are not ready to meet the need. So what we have done is, 
we have begun to do more surveillance over how these private-
sector industries are handling their supply.
    We do not regulate that supply, but we want to have more 
eyes on it so we can make sure they are preparing for that 
broadside that might come. We are also trying to make sure we 
help to mitigate any supply chain interruption. So, if they get 
some of their material for their product from overseas, some 
country, we want to make sure there is not going to be a 
disruption--whether politically based or supply-based--that 
keeps them from being able to produce. So we will work with 
you, because this is a big issue.
    Senator Cardin. Well, as we saw for the pharmaceutical 
industry, how they manipulated the market for profits for 
insulin, the same thing is happening on less-expensive drugs, 
where they are changing their production capacities in order to 
maximize their profits, which we understand. But since we are 
the largest payer for these services, it seems to me we can 
have a stronger impact on their decision-making.
    Secretary Becerra. We will look forward to working with you 
on that.
    Senator Cardin. As you know, oral health is closely tied to 
physical health. The final Calendar Year 2023 Medicare 
physician fee schedule rule expanded dental services tied to 
medically necessary conditions, which means that these services 
will now be covered for Medicare beneficiaries. That is a step 
in the right direction.
    But as you and I know, we have major gaps in both the 
Medicaid and Medicare programs in regards to coverage for oral 
health and dental services, particularly in the underserved 
communities. They are particularly vulnerable. So what steps do 
you intend to take in order to deal with access to oral health 
care in America, particularly in underserved communities?
    Secretary Becerra. Well, as you said, one of the first 
steps we took is to try to make sure that where we had the 
authority, we expanded access to dental care services to folks 
on Medicaid. And we have made the effort--with your support--to 
try to expand coverage within Medicaid for dental health 
services more directly.
    We count, in many respects, on our community health 
centers, which are able to use some of the funding they get to 
expand services, including in dental health. We are going to 
try to do everything we can within the authorities we have to 
expand access, because we know an infection that is related to 
your dental situation could ultimately impact your overall 
health.
    You know the story of Deamonte Driver, a young man from 
your State of Maryland, who died because, at the end, a 
toothache which his parents did not have the money to have him 
go see a dentist for, became an abscess and it became an 
infection, and before you knew it, Deamonte was dead.
    Senator Cardin. It is one of the best investments we can 
make--oral health. We get great returns.
    Let me just say in concluding that, in hepatitis C, I thank 
you for your efforts there. We need to identify those who have 
hepatitis C. The treatments are there. It saves lives, and it 
saves cost. So I appreciate the initiative in your budget, and 
I would hope Congress would work on budget rules which would 
encourage that type of service to deal with diseases.
    Secretary Becerra. We are backing up your hope.
    The Chairman. Senator Bennet is next.
    Senator Bennet. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Secretary, thank you for coming back, and thank you for 
your service.
    As you know, Congress acted in a bipartisan way to address 
surprise medical bills through the No Surprises Act in 2020. I 
worked with Senators Cassidy and Hassan on that legislation. We 
built a big, broad bipartisan coalition, and we hoped to ensure 
a level playing field between providers and insurers as they 
resolve payment disputes.
    Through the dispute process that we set up, both parties 
were supposed to be able to provide information specified in 
statute--specified in statute--and the arbitration entities 
were required to take this information and weigh it equally. 
But we have heard a lot about how the implementation has been 
challenged, and to be completely plain and simple about it, Mr. 
Secretary, we believe the administration is not implementing 
the legislation as intended. We are seeing lawsuit after 
lawsuit from providers. Insurants are not responding in a 
timely manner, sometimes not at all.
    And even when the payment determinations are won by 
providers, payers still do not pay providers after the 
statutory deadline. It is a big mess, and CMS has frozen and 
unfrozen the process over the last few months, which has led to 
a significant reduction in cash flows, leaving providers on the 
hook for tens of thousands of disputes. While patients are 
still technically protected, these implementation challenges 
harm every single patient because they do not know whether 
providers are actually going to be there to provide the 
services that they need.
    So, we've got to get this back on track, and I just want 
you to know that I am willing to work with you and others to 
get this in the right place. In the budget, HHS requested 
another $500 million to implement this bill, but I do not see 
evidence that it has gone well or right by congressional 
intent. Can you give me your assessment of what has gone wrong 
and how you intend to reduce the backlog and legally implement 
this bill?
    Secretary Becerra. First, thank you, Senator, for your work 
in helping us have this critical law passed. But secondly, I do 
not think you or I knew what was going to come. So let me ask 
for your help. I am going to plead for your help. We are 
receiving more than ten times the number of claims that anyone 
ever expected, and these arbitrators that are supposed to go 
through these claims are swamped.
    Remember, they do not get paid unless they adjudicate the 
claims. What we are finding is that way too many--I don't want 
to say the vast majority--but way, way too many are frivolous, 
because there is no cost to file a claim. So, everyone is just 
filing all sorts of claims, and these arbitrators are trying to 
figure out what cases to handle. That is what is bogging down 
the system. But I will tell you this: we are staying true to 
the law. We are not letting patients get caught in this food 
fight between the provider of the care and the insurance 
company that has to pay for the care.
    We are making sure patients are not getting the bills in 
the mail saying ``you owe this money.'' It is going to be 
between the provider and the insurer, and what we are trying to 
do is have a system that works. So I plead with you and your 
colleagues: help us make sure that we get to the legitimate 
cases, so a provider who is looking for a real payment or an 
insurer who is saying, ``Hey, you are asking for too much,'' we 
could adjudicate that----
    Senator Bennet. Okay. Well, let's--I have another question 
I want to ask, but I think we have--I do not know whose fault 
it is, but we have a system that does not work, I think. So I 
certainly will help, and I volunteer Senator Hassan and Senator 
Cassidy too, to figure out how we can all work together to do 
it. [Laughter.]
    Secretary Becerra. I am writing names down.
    Senator Bennet. Well, you should only write my name down 
three times, but I will try to get the other folks. And I want 
to say again, thanks for your leadership. Just a few months 
ago, as the chairman knows, the CDC put out their latest youth 
mental health report. It confirmed what I have heard across 
Colorado over just the past few years: we have a youth mental 
health epidemic in America, a mental health crisis in America.
    According to the CDC report, 40 percent of high school 
students felt so sad or hopeless last year that they could not 
engage in their regular activities for at least 2 weeks. I was 
saying to my staff the other day that, when I get a call from 
Colorado that somebody the age of my daughter has died, I no 
longer ask if it was a car accident or was it leukemia. The 
question is, was it suicide, or was it fentanyl, or was it a 
gun?
    By the way, when I was the Superintendent of the Denver 
Public Schools, we never asked that question just 15 years ago. 
It is also true for seniors, you know. One in five Medicare 
beneficiaries have mental health conditions and, among Latino 
seniors, that goes up to nearly one in three. I know we have 
done a lot in this committee on mental health, but we have to 
do more, and I am glad the HHS budget calls for parity in 
Medicare Advantage and invests in integrated mental health in 
the primary care.
    This is why I introduced with Senator Wyden, Chairman 
Wyden, the Better Mental Health Care for Americans Act. Our 
bill would require parity for Medicare Advantage plans, Part D, 
and Medicaid, and increase reimbursement across programs for 
integrated care. I am extremely grateful--I am coming to the 
end of my questioning; I know I am out of time. I am extremely 
grateful to your staff for working with us to draft that bill, 
and I just want to ask you if, as we continue to work on it, 
whether you would be willing to work with us on it, because I 
am sure you're detecting the same trends in mental health that 
we are. Maybe with just 5 seconds you could----
    Secretary Becerra. One second: yes.
    Senator Bennet. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Bennet, and thank you for 
your leadership on this. It takes your breath away what some of 
these gaps are. You know, we know in Eugene, OR, for example, 
if a young person has a problem in school, in effect has a 
major breakdown, there is literally no treatment bed for them 
at that time. So you are doing incredibly important work.
    Senator Bennet. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Lankford is next.
    Senator Lankford. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Mr. Secretary, 
good to see you again.
    I had a parent who was in my office today. As you can 
imagine, the parents who come here to DC do a lot of research 
and a lot of background, and when they bring questions, they 
bring very different types of questions. Their particular child 
had a health-care issue, and they were asking about the cost of 
drugs. They went through several different proposals that are 
out there, but then they asked a very specific, pointed, well-
educated question about pharmacy benefit managers.
    They asked what is being done, because that seems to be a 
black hole, and all I am reading and seeing seems to be a lot 
of information on that. Now that's interesting. I said they 
were very perceptive to be able to go through the different 
aspects on that. You talk a lot about drug policy, but there is 
nothing about PBMs in some of the proposals in your budget 
piece.
    Now CMS--we work with them directly on it. I want to talk 
to you about some of that as well. But for the PBMs in 
particular, they are not even mentioned once. What is the plan 
at this point on dealing with drug pricing and the PBMs?
    Secretary Becerra. And, Senator, thank you. And they may 
not be as directly included within the budget, but the 
administration is working on PBMs, because we know more and 
more, there is a growing concern that the middlemen in the 
process of getting drugs from manufacturer to patient are 
skimming off a good deal of the money that is being generated. 
What we want is for consumers to get the drug at the lowest 
price possible.
    I will tell you that most of these issues will likely end 
up in court, as you can expect, but we are going to try to move 
to make sure that if there is a middleman that is going through 
the process of making sure a drug is getting from the 
manufacturer to the patient, that it is done efficiently. So we 
could use your help to make sure----
    Senator Lankford. Well, we would be glad to work with the 
administration. You will find bipartisan support to be able to 
deal with this. Some basic elements of transparency--obviously, 
PBMs are very opaque about where the pricing is, where the 
money actually goes, or even the standards for evaluation. 
Different pharmacies are evaluated different ways, different 
months even, where they don't even know the evaluation of the 
price on it. So getting some standardization--we have made 
those recommendations to your team. We would love to be able to 
work on that, and if we need legislation, be able to fix it. 
Let us continue to work on that.
    If I can continue on that same theme, this issue of tiering 
is becoming more and more important--where the drug will be 
released out. There can be a generic drug that is released out 
later in competition, but according to the PBMs and the 
original manufacturer, it is put on a branded tier, meaning 
that the patient at the pharmacy counter is paying the more 
expensive rate, rather than the generic rate for their 
pharmaceutical, and it also becomes an issue for Medicare as 
well.
    That is not an issue that you brought up on this, but it is 
a really big issue that we need to be able to address: this 
whole issue of tiering, of where a new generic drug comes out, 
whether it is on a branded tier or generic tier. Can you help 
us try to settle this issue to lower prices?
    Secretary Becerra. We will follow up with you, Senator.
    Senator Lankford. Thank you for that.
    Let me talk a little bit about something Senator Menendez 
brought up as well, and it is this issue of the children in ORR 
custody who have come across the border. These are the 
unaccompanied minors. The New York Times published this report 
that was pretty horrific about labor, but this is not new. It 
is something Senator Portman and I and several others have 
worked on for several years, trying to be able to figure out 
how we can actually manage this.
    The Times actually identified that there is a stat that 
there are 85,000 children that HHS lost immediate contact with 
once they were placed in sponsorship. So that is my first 
question: is that number accurate, because once HHS does the 
vetting, places them with sponsors, the next question is, do 
you know where they are, even for those first 30 days? And then 
when you get to Day 31, do you know where they are?
    And if I can push this a little farther, if they do not 
show up for their first hearing, is someone from HHS checking 
on them, because at that point they are lost.
    Secretary Becerra. And, Senator, every week I get briefed 
by my team, sometimes two or three times a week, on this 
situation with the unaccompanied migrant kids and where we 
stand. I have never heard that number of 85,000. I do not know 
where it comes from, so I cannot attest. I would say, it does 
not sound at all to be realistic, and what we do is, we try to 
follow up as best we can with these kids. Congress has given us 
certain authorities. Our authorities essentially end the moment 
we have found a suitable sponsor to place that child with.
    We try to do some follow-up, but neither the child nor the 
sponsors are actually obligated to follow up with us. We make 
every effort to follow up with them as best we can.
    Senator Lankford. But that is the first 30 days; there is 
the 
follow-up that is actually happening there. But if they do not 
show up for the first hearing, there is no follow-up at that 
point; is that correct?
    Secretary Becerra. The follow-up for purposes of the 
immigration proceeding would be, I believe, through the 
Department of Homeland Security.
    Senator Lankford. Okay. Well, at this point, no one's 
following up. There are some assumptions that are made there 
that if an unaccompanied minor has been placed in the home and 
then they do not show up for hearings, no one seems to be 
checking on them to be able to figure out are they still at the 
same address they were dropped off at, what are they doing, and 
why are they not showing up at hearings?
    I also understand that you have called for an audit, a 4-
week audit in February, on that. My understanding is, that 
audit concludes next week. Is that something that we could get 
a copy of--that audit report as well--to be able to see next 
week when it is finished?
    Secretary Becerra. Let me make sure, Senator, when we have 
that audit finished, if we are able to share publicly the 
results of that. I believe we can probably share most of the 
information, because most of the process that we use is public.
    Senator Lankford. Right.
    Secretary Becerra. And what we are trying to do is make 
sure that our checks on vetting are catching anyone who should 
not be considered a suitable sponsor. And so our audit is for 
the purpose of making sure that our background checks are 
fulfilling that mission.
    Senator Lankford. Right. I do not know why there would be a 
good reason you could not share with this committee. And even 
if we were seeing it just locked in with this committee to be 
able to see it and it was not publicly released, I do not know 
of a reason that audit could not be released.
    Secretary Becerra. There are issues of privacy for the 
children and so forth, but we will----
    Senator Lankford. I get that, but there are probably not 
kids' names in the report; but thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Lankford, thank you for bringing up 
the pharmacy benefit managers, what we all know as PBMs. We are 
going to be having a hearing next Thursday in this committee 
specifically on them. It is a result of Senator Crapo and I 
having had a number of conversations about it, and I want to 
let my colleagues have a chance to ask their questions. But 
this conversation will continue, and I hope, colleagues, every 
member can come next Thursday.
    Senator Cassidy?
    Senator Cassidy. Thank you. Mr. Secretary, thank you, sir.
    We had kind of let you--thank you for, you know, the 
dialogue before the meeting. We told you we were concerned 
about, how do we know the people at HHS are working? So let me 
put this picture up. This is a picture taken at 10:40 a.m. last 
Monday at HHS headquarters. It's like empty, and then we could 
have pictures of other parking lots that are similarly empty.
    So you know, wow! The building's empty. If there's no cars, 
the building's empty. So we just appropriated $3 billion--well, 
first, tell me this, please. Can you give a breakdown of how 
many full-time employees are at their desk in one of these 
buildings every day?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, when you take a look at the 
workforce at HHS, we are close to 90,000 throughout the 
country, and working in various parts of the country, some here 
at headquarters. By the way, at headquarters, we have an 
underground parking lot----
    Senator Cassidy. I have limited time, so this may be 
misleading. So tell me what percent of the employees are at 
their desk, full-time employees are at their desk on any given 
day. And I do not mean to be rude. There is just such limited 
time.
    Secretary Becerra. No, and I appreciate that. Our folks are 
working full-time.
    Senator Cassidy. No, but how many are at their desk as 
opposed to being at home or someplace else, the coffee shop or 
whatever?
    Secretary Becerra. What we make sure we care about is that 
they are performing, and they are delivering, and that is why--
--
    Senator Cassidy. Well, that is not really answering my 
question, because I know the best practice now in many 
industries is to bring people back in. So, is it 5 percent, is 
it 10 percent, is it 1 percent? How many folks are actually 
sitting at their desk in a government building when they are 
working full-time every day?
    Secretary Becerra. And we have folks who, as they are 
working full time----
    Senator Cassidy. So that is kind of not an answer. Clearly, 
sir, you do not want to answer that question, and I do not mean 
to be rude, but you do not. But that kind of begs that the 
answer may not be flattering.
    When CMS put out a request for employees, as regards to the 
complex drug negotiation that was in a recent bill, the posting 
offered ``generous telework policy.'' What does ``generous 
telework policy'' mean? If somebody hired into that program, 
how many days a month would they be expected to actually be in 
a government building, as opposed to wherever they wish to be?
    Secretary Becerra. And, Senator, that would depend on the 
worker. Some people have never left their job even during the 
height of the pandemic.
    Senator Cassidy. I am not speaking about leaving their job. 
I am speaking about being at their desk. I am not speaking of 
some, but of a percent, if I may, because anecdotes are not 
data.
    Secretary Becerra. You are limiting the scope of what we 
do. We have investigators who never sit at desks.
    Senator Cassidy. No, but say, take somebody who 
traditionally would have been at their desk before the 
pandemic, please.
    Secretary Becerra. And depending on the work that has to be 
performed, they will be in the office at times; sometimes they 
may be in the field. But what is important----
    Senator Cassidy. Can I ask just for the record--because, 
obviously, it does not seem, Mr. Secretary, you are prepared to 
answer that question--but for the record, can you give us a 
percent of the actual workers who are full-time who would be 
expected to be at their desk, not an inspector in Louisiana, 
but someone else? If you can give us that for the record.
    Secretary Becerra. We can follow up, Senator.
    Senator Cassidy. Can the agency provide us VPN data, or 
some other measure of accountability, that shows that the 
people truly are working from home?
    Secretary Becerra. We can certainly show you that they are 
performing. The fact that 700 million shots have gone into the 
arms of Americans----
    Senator Cassidy. But do you have that VPN data, because 
initially when the pandemic started, we saw VPN data that 
showed a double-digit number of employees were not turning on 
their VPN every day, and so it suggested they were not 
accessing emails, for example. So is that data still being 
collected? If so, can you share those results?
    Secretary Becerra. I could try to get back to you on that.
    Senator Cassidy. Now, if you live in the DC area, you get a 
work differential. So you get a little bit more. Your cost of 
living is more. So if someone who is in this building with an 
empty parking lot, if someone in that building, not knowing 
where they are currently working, are they still getting a 
cost-of-living adjustment as if they are working in Washington, 
DC?
    Secretary Becerra. Yes. First, I have to tell you, Senator, 
that is not the headquarters of the HHS, of the Department of 
HHS.
    Senator Cassidy. It is CMS headquarters.
    Secretary Becerra. Oh, okay, okay. So we can get back to 
you on it. If someone is working--as I said, we have been 
coming in day-in/day-out. We have been performing day-in/day-
out.
    Senator Cassidy. But let us assume that because--I have 
heard from people within the agency that, in reality, people 
are only required to come in 1 day out of a month, and this has 
been something we have heard from CDC along those lines, but I 
have also heard from somebody who is working at CMS. Now, I 
assume that you have a global policy, because you have the same 
union negotiating for all of HHS. So it seems to me as if it is 
going to be the same policy wherever you are.
    So my question is, if you are working from home 
consistently, and originally you were based in DC, are you 
still getting a cost-of-living adjustment, even though we 
frankly do not know what, where--you might be flying in 1 day a 
month, but living in West Virginia.
    Secretary Becerra. Again, Senator, I am not familiar with 
this statistic that you are throwing out that says----
    Senator Cassidy. But is there a cost-of-living adjustment 
for people who are taking advantage of ``generous telework''?
    Secretary Becerra. There is certainly a cost-of-living 
adjustment for folks who work in high-cost areas.
    Senator Cassidy. Even if they are teleworking?
    Secretary Becerra. If they are performing their work, they 
are entitled to receive a cost-of-living adjustment if they 
work in a high-cost living area.
    Senator Cassidy. And when you define ``work in a high-cost 
living area,'' do you mean telework? I mean they could be--
their VPN could show them in DC, but they could be in West 
Virginia. So are they getting paid as if they are living 
physically and showing up every day and parking in that parking 
lot every day in the DC area?
    Secretary Becerra. So, you would have to take a look at the 
particular job description to find out what type of work is 
done and where they are located to be able to make that 
determination.
    Senator Cassidy. I yield.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    Next is Senator Hassan.
    Senator Hassan. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking 
Member Crapo, for having this hearing, and thank you, Mr. 
Secretary, for being here.
    I want to start with a discussion of State opioid response 
grants. I was really pleased that the Department's proposed 
budget includes $2 billion for State opioid response grants. 
These grants, which I have worked since 2017 to secure and 
expand, have really helped my State significantly improve our 
response to the fentanyl crisis.
    Last year, you and I discussed this program's impact in New 
Hampshire. New Hampshire's been really hard hit by the fentanyl 
crisis in particular. We discussed the importance of continuity 
of funding, because it helps States plan and avoid drastic 
cuts. Just before the hearing, we were talking about a program 
in Rochester, NH called Hope on Haven Hill, which focuses on 
treatment, recovery, and transition for pregnant moms and 
parenting moms who have substance use disorder. The continuity 
of funding has been really critical for them to be able to 
develop that program and really help these women turn their 
lives around and get better.
    So, in last December's appropriations bill, Congress acted 
on a bipartisan basis to require HHS to, and this is a quote, 
``prevent unusually large funding changes from year to year in 
these grants.'' I know from our past conversations that you 
understand and share this really important goal. How does HHS 
plan to implement this statutory requirement to prevent year-
to-year funding cliffs in State opioid response grants for 
States like New Hampshire?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, first I have to say ``thank 
you,'' because in many ways these are your babies, these SOR 
grants. You have championed them, and you have made it possible 
for us to actually get money into communities that need to deal 
with opioids. And you are saving lives, so thank you for that.
    The President has followed your lead. He is calling for 
some $2 billion in investment. That should help a lot of these 
agencies that are administering the funds to get services to 
folks who are trying to get off of opioids, a way to know that 
they are going to have a consistent and hopefully permanent 
stream of support, because the last thing you need is to be 
there one day, but not the next.
    The work that you all are doing is helping us not only make 
sure that we institutionalize these programs under the SOR 
grant program, but that we also make sure that it stays 
consistent, so that we do not have one day you have the 
resources to do it, and the next day you have to close down all 
these shops. But we will work with you on that.
    Senator Hassan. Well, I appreciate that. I really just 
wanted to make sure that your staff and mine will continue to 
work on this. It is everything from certainty and 
predictability for patients, as well as being able to recruit 
people into the workforce to do this work, right? So I look 
forward to working with you and your staff on that.
    Secretary Becerra. Thank you.
    Senator Hassan. Now I want to turn to discuss title X 
family planning funding. I want to thank you for including 
robust funding for maternal and reproductive health in the 
Department's budget, including doubling funding for title X 
family planning to $512 million. Along with Senator Warren, I 
am leading a letter to appropriators echoing that request.
    Title X is the only Federal program dedicated to providing 
family planning, and it has historically been a program that 
has been underfunded. But we all know that in light of the 
Supreme Court's decision last year to restrict women's 
reproductive freedom, this is a program that is more essential 
than ever. So can you speak to the importance of Congress 
appropriating this essential title X family planning funding, 
and then I want to ask you one more question, so if you can, be 
a little bit brief.
    Secretary Becerra. Family planning has not received a boost 
in funding in 8 years. It is time. We know how essential it is. 
It is not just funding for one type of care; it is funding for 
family planning services--indispensable. The President's budget 
recognizes it. We look forward to working with you to get that 
across the finish line so we can actually expand services and 
get them to communities that absolutely need them.
    Senator Hassan. Well, and it is absolutely essential to a 
woman's capacity for self-determination and dignity, so I 
appreciate it very, very much.
    I want to turn to one other issue, which is the MAT Act 
implementation. At the end of last year, the Mainstreaming 
Addiction Treatment Act, MAT, which I led with Senator 
Murkowski, was signed into law. This bill eliminates needless 
outdated restrictions on health-care providers that prevented 
them from prescribing buprenorphine, a critical treatment 
option for people struggling with fentanyl and other opioids.
    I know that you, and the administration more broadly, are 
strongly behind this new law, and I really want to thank you 
for your and your colleagues' work to support it. Can you 
please speak to the importance of these changes and what HHS is 
doing now in coordination with other agencies to expand access 
to buprenorphine by ensuring that health-care providers know 
about these changes?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, gosh; where do I start? 
Medication-assisted treatment is critical, because it is one of 
the ways you save a life. If you give buprenorphine to an 
individual before they OD, you have just saved a life. If you 
can try to remove the barriers that kept a physician from 
participating in a program to be able to prescribe a lifesaving 
drug, you saved a life. When we were able to really remove the 
X waiver cap, we were able to make it more likely that a 
physician would want to participate in this program and not 
find themselves subjected to law enforcement oversight as if 
they were encouraging drug use.
    What we did was, we liberated the system to actually treat 
drug addiction and take away the stigma. So we look forward to 
working with you on that.
    Senator Hassan. Well, I look forward to that too, and 
just--I am over time. But one of the critical things here could 
be making sure that we work with law enforcement, as well as 
health-care providers, to stock buprenorphine in pharmacies, 
and make sure that primary care physicians and other primary 
prescribers know that they can prescribe this lifesaving 
medication.
    So, thank you. I look forward to continuing to work with 
you.
    Secretary Becerra. Thank you.
    The Chairman. And thank you for your work, Senator Hassan, 
especially on title X, an enormously important program--and it 
has not come up yet today.
    Senator Johnson, you are next.
    Senator Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary 
Becerra, welcome.
    Do you believe it is important that we understand how the 
coronavirus originated?
    Secretary Becerra. Absolutely.
    Senator Johnson. Is there somebody in your agency, your 
department, who is spearheading the investigation to determine 
that?
    Secretary Becerra. We have done a number of--taken a number 
of initiatives to try to move forward there, including having 
OIG take a closer look.
    Senator Johnson. So you are saying it is the OIG? I mean, 
is there somebody within the Department outside of the 
Inspector General that is spearheading this, somebody in 
charge?
    Secretary Becerra. CDC and NIH are also doing a scrub. We 
are all trying to get as much information--the difficulty is 
that we are not getting a lot of cooperation from some of the 
sources externally that could probably give us----
    Senator Johnson. Well, let us talk about lack of 
cooperation, because I would say the same thing is true in 
terms of cooperation out of the agencies. Do you believe the 
public has a right to know how the agencies are spending their 
money and how they are operating?
    Secretary Becerra. The public does have a right to know, 
yes.
    Senator Johnson. There are two primary methods for that. 
You have FOIA, Freedom of Information Act requests, and then 
you also have congressional oversight. Would you agree that 
FOIA is generally subjected to more redactions than 
congressional oversight would be?
    Secretary Becerra. I would not say that, but we do have to 
be careful what goes into the public domain with respect to 
confidentiality and privacy.
    Senator Johnson. I understand. There are some exceptions 
that are very explicit out there, and a lot of them make sense. 
But I would argue, I think many people do, that congressional 
oversight really is not subject to those same redactions, 
particularly when we have security clearances, and we can take 
a look at classified information that is appropriately redacted 
under FOIA.
    Let me give you a couple of examples. We requested these 
documents. [Holding up pages.] By the way, in June of 2021, 
under a FOIA request--court-ordered--4,000 pages of different 
documents, primarily emails of Anthony Fauci, were produced 
under the FOIA. In September 2021 we--well, that month, we had 
five members of Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs ask 
for those same pages unredacted, and there is a law that says 
you shall turn that over to us.
    In September 2021, we started working with HHS to produce 
those documents in an accommodated process. So we narrowed the 
4,000 pages down to 400 to get those things unredacted. They 
were not handed over to us. What we did--we were allowed to 
read them 50 pages at a time in a reading room and take notes. 
Some productions we did get. For example, we got this document 
dated February 4th, between Anthony Fauci, Jeremy Ferrar of the 
Wellcome Company, and Francis Collins. You see the redactions 
here. This is the same document produced under FOIA without the 
redactions.
    So now we know what was redacted, and this was redacted, by 
the way, under (b)(4), which is trade secrets. One thing that 
was redacted here is Anthony Fauci saying, question mark, 
``serial passage in ACE2 transgenic mice,'' in other words, 
humanized mice. They were talking about--Ferrar is writing to 
Francis Collins. ``Remains a very real possibility of 
accidental lab passage in animals to give glycans.''
    He said that ``Eddie thinks it's a 60-40 lab side.'' Ferrar 
said he thinks it's 50-50. Again, this is February 4th. There 
is nothing to do with trade secrets in that redaction.
    Another example. This is February 2nd. Again, this is with 
their understanding that they funded this dangerous research, 
and now they are into cover-up mode. Here is what we got in our 
production, the heavy redactions. [Holding up document.] This 
is what was released under FOIA. [Holding up document].
    Now this was released under the (b)(5) exception, which is 
privileged information within or between agencies. Again, this 
is with Jeremy Ferrar of the Wellcome Trust. So we have 
redactions with--you know, privileged information did not 
apply, and we still had it redacted. I do not have time to get 
into that. This is completely inappropriate, and by the way we 
are down--you have produced 350 pages to us in the reading 
room. For over a year, we have been asking for the last 50 
pages. This is what the 50 pages looked like, okay? [Entire 
pages are blacked out.]
    Now again, I would argue congressional oversight should not 
be subject to the same redactions that were applied under a 
FOIA request. I am asking you: will you commit today to provide 
for our oversight--now Senator Paul is on this. Again, we had 
five members of Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, 
under a law that says you shall provide this. Will you commit 
to provide us the last 50 pages of communication between 
Anthony Fauci, Francis Collins, Jeremy Ferrar, as it relates to 
the origin of the coronavirus? Will you commit to that?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, I absolutely will commit to 
make sure we follow up with you on your request to get some of 
that information. Again, this is in compliance with the law 
that you received the information. I do not know what 
particular statute with regard to disclosure was applied here, 
but you are absolutely entitled to the information that by law 
a member of the Senate or the House could get to follow up----
    Senator Johnson. Yes. But again, you are not complying with 
the law, because you are redacting things, for example under 
the deliberative process between and within agencies, and it is 
communication outside of the agencies with the Wellcome Trust. 
Again, these redactions are not complying with the law. So 
again, I will appreciate--we will follow up with you. I expect 
to see the unredacted 50 pages very soon.
    Secretary Becerra. We can comply with the law, Senator, but 
we absolutely will make sure we follow up with you.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Johnson.
    Next is Senator Cortez Masto.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. 
Secretary, it is always great to see you. Thank you.
    Before I get to my questions, I do want to quickly touch on 
Medicare Advantage. Seniors in my State rely on Medicare 
Advantage to access affordable, high-quality health care. I 
often hear from Nevadans how vitally important this program is 
to supporting their health and the health of their loved ones. 
That is why I have long been a supporter of Medicare Advantage. 
This year, I am proud to have led the annual bipartisan letter, 
and I believe there were 57 Senators, my colleagues, who signed 
onto the letter urging the administration to preserve and 
strengthen the program. Last week, I spoke with CMS 
Administrator Brooks-LaSure about the proposed updates to the 
program for 2024 and what they mean for Nevadans.
    And I will just reiterate today, Mr. Secretary, that any 
efforts to address overpayments in Medicare Advantage should 
support program integrity and preserve the sustainability of 
the entire Medicare program without disrupting access, without 
increasing cost or jeopardizing the quality of care. So, as you 
move to finalize 2024 policies, I urge you to prioritize the 
program improvements that benefit patients and deliver value to 
seniors and taxpayers. So, I just wanted to start with that.
    Secondly, I too noticed all the purple here in the room. 
Thank you to the Alzheimer's Association, everybody who 
advocates. It is something that I dealt with within my family 
with my grandmother. I appreciate your advocacy over the years. 
Thank you. You always have a supporter with me.
    Secretary Becerra, let me talk about the commercial 
prescription drug inflation rebates.
    Last year, as you well know, we passed historic drug 
pricing policies in the Inflation Reduction Act. This law is 
already working to lower drug costs for our seniors with 
Medicare. Importantly, the Inflation Reduction Act penalizes 
drug companies for raising prices faster than inflation. 
However, as it stands today, these companies are only held 
accountable for hiking drug prices in the Medicare program.
    That is why I am introducing a bill to extend the inflation 
rebate penalty to include drugs used by people with private 
commercial insurance. My bill will ensure that Nevada families, 
as well as our seniors, are no longer squeezed by drug 
companies' outrageous price hikes.
    Secretary Becerra, I am glad to see the goals of my bill 
reflected in the President's budget proposal. How would the 
inflation rebate penalty for the commercial market impact drug 
prices for patients at the pharmacy counter, as well as health-
care payers like employers and unions?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, well first, thank you for that 
effort. We want to help any way we can, because we know what 
happens--take insulin. Insulin was only to apply to those who 
were on Medicare, 67 million Americans on Medicare. Today, the 
three leading manufacturers of insulin have said they are going 
to drop their price of insulin for those who are not on 
Medicare, so those in the private insurance market.
    And so we see what happens when you introduce competition 
into this. The prices come down, because everybody now has to 
compete to get your business. Your bill, I suspect, would do 
the same thing. It would introduce that competition in the 
private insurance sector that would complement what we do in 
Medicare, and the end result is, you drop the price for a whole 
lot of Americans who are not on Medicare.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, I appreciate that. And let 
me just add that my commercial prescription drug inflation 
rebate bill has the potential to generate significant savings 
for the Federal Government. In fact, CBO projected that a 
similar provision would save $34 billion over 10 years. So, I 
thank you.
    Let me jump to something very quickly here as well: mental 
health. I have heard my colleagues here talking about this. As 
you well know, this is such an important issue for me as well, 
and I support my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for 
working to address this. I appreciate the support for the 
crisis services in the budget proposal around mental health in 
the Fiscal Year 2023 funding bill, the significant expansion in 
funding for 988. The new suicide and crisis lifeline has helped 
communities manage increased demand in call volume since the 
line went live last summer.
    I know; I talk to my folks in Nevada all the time about 
this. On this committee, we are very focused on what comes 
next, what happens when someone in crisis dials the line and 
needs somebody to come help or somewhere to go for that 
treatment. I was proud, with the chairman, to pass increased 
funding for 988 and crisis care through mobile units in the 
December omnibus bill, but we have more work to do.
    My question for you is, in your view, what is the biggest 
challenge to improving crisis care coordination when we are 
talking about the mental health support that is needed across 
the country?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, workforce. We need to hire up 
more folks, pay them decent wages so they will stay in the 
field, because right now we know that health care has a 
shortage of workers period, but mental health is even worse. 
So, if we really want to say to somebody ``call 988 and you are 
going to get real help,'' we have to make sure that there 
really will be real help at the end of that call.
    Senator Cortez Masto. I look forward to working with you, 
because I am hearing the same thing. I see it in my State and 
across the country; so, thank you.
    Secretary Becerra. Thank you.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague for her questions, and 
especially the points about MA, Medicare Advantage. We have 
worked very closely on this committee with Chairman Casey, who 
has also put in a lot of effort on this at the Aging Committee.
    Just a quick word. I believe Oregon, Nevada, and Minnesota 
have the highest percentage of senior citizens in MA in the 
country. And having spent a lot of time in these precincts 
since my days working with seniors, I have come to the 
conclusion that, unfortunately, not all Medicare Advantage is 
created equal.
    There has been some very good MA, there has been some not 
so good, and we are going to work very closely with our 
colleague to make sure we get the former and have less of the 
latter, because her points are very well taken. We are going to 
work closely with the administration to make sure that we 
recognize that kind of distinction, and I appreciate her 
comments.
    Next is Senator Tillis.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Becerra, 
thank you for being here.
    Before I make some comments or questions, I also want to 
recognize the Alzheimer's Association. You all were in my 
office, the North Carolina delegation was in my office 
yesterday, and my staff have been meeting with them. I looked 
at my staff and said, ``Are there any priorities that they have 
discussed that we do not support?'' They said the answer is 
``no.'' We support them all, including a ``dear colleague'' 
letter for funding for NIH. So you can count on my support. But 
the reason I did that is because I wanted to talk with them 
about something that should be on your agenda, and it relates 
to research, and it relates to prescription drug pricing, and I 
will get to that in a minute, because I want to use a few 
examples.
    I know that we have had some members talk about the great 
advances, Secretary Becerra, in the Inflation Reduction Act. I 
think, based on patterns that I am seeing in the industry, you 
could call it the Investment Reduction Act. Mr. Chairman, I 
have three documents that, without objection, I would like to 
submit to the record.
    The Chairman. Without objection, so ordered.
    [The documents appear in the appendix beginning on p. 179.]
    Senator Tillis. Two are related to Eli Lilly, one to 
another player in the pharmaceutical space, that have said they 
are making business decisions to drop small molecule research 
and other things because the time that they would need to 
recover the investment they anticipate is not there. So you can 
expect reductions in small molecule research. You can expect 
reductions in an eye drug that they were trying to expand.
    You can see the effects of not getting well-intended policy 
right, and Secretary Becerra, Congressman Becerra, I think the 
work that you did on a bipartisan basis, whether it was the 
21st Century Cures bill, or even more importantly, the heat 
that you took from your side of the aisle to get Trade 
Promotion Authority--tells me you are a person who likes to get 
to a positive end, a productive end.
    The only reason, the primary reason I did not support your 
confirmation--in full disclosure--is the position you have 
taken on march-in rights. And so, I am not going to have enough 
time to get to many questions, but I think it needs to be said 
that I believe we are going about it the wrong way in terms of 
the haircut that needs to be done to get prescription prices 
lower, not at a point in time and not at the expense of other 
research and investment that is necessary.
    I tell everybody in the industry I believe that there is a 
haircut coming, but I have not heard any member talk about who 
needs to be in the barber shop. I think it needs to be pharma; 
I think it needs to be the pharmacy benefit managers. It needs 
to be insurers--I just wrote this down as notes--the medical 
profession, the pharmacies, the FDA, and the legal community. 
If you are really going to fix the fundamental problems with 
drug pricing and look people in the eye and say you are doing 
something not just to claim victory, as it was done with the 
IRA, but something that is sustainable, every single one of 
them needs to be there.
    They are all a part of the value chain, they all need to be 
at the table, and we need to get it right. Because you may be 
able to correct me if I am wrong, but I have not seen a single, 
successful, sustainable solution to this, or at least a part of 
the solution, except when Bayh-Dole passed something not too 
long ago. Now, Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit for the 
record an op-ed that was written by Senators Bayh and Dole in 
2002 that said they never intended for their legislation to 
become weaponized.
    The Chairman. Without objection, so ordered.
    [The op-ed appears in the appendix on p. 179.]
    Senator Tillis. And in spite of the fact that the NIH has 
recently just rejected imposing price controls based on price, 
now we have a work group that is going to consider price as one 
of the ways that we go about getting down on this industry. If 
we do it, we are going to have a longer window for work, the 
very promising work that is being done for Alzheimer's.
    I've got a vested interest in that. I was a part-time 
caregiver to my grandmother. I've got a vested interest in 
broader research. I've got two potentially deadly--one 
incurable and one curable--diseases in my body. One is prostate 
cancer, the other is Wegener's granulomatosis. Both of them are 
being managed. Prostate cancer has a lot of promise, provided 
that it is within that window. Wegener's is a rare disease. It 
is not going to be something that we are going to see a cure 
for, particularly if we do not get this right and incent the 
private sector to invest in things where they may have to walk 
away from it, like an Alzheimer's drug, after a billion dollars 
in investment.
    And so I told the Alzheimer's Association to please study 
up on the attacks on intellectual property protections; take a 
look at what the administration's done with TRIPS waivers and 
other things, really threatening the return on investment that 
these companies have to make; and please make sure that that is 
a part of your pitch when you come to these members of Congress 
and expect them to produce a prescription drug pricing strategy 
that they can look you in the eye and say is going to produce 
year-over-year results.
    Thank you for being here.
    The Chairman. Senator Tillis, thank you for your point with 
respect to the nature of how pharmaceuticals, particularly as 
it relates to the regulatory system, have a breakdown at every 
step of the way. That is what Senator Grassley and I found in 
our mammoth research report. If anybody is having trouble 
sleeping tonight, you can go through the scores and scores of 
footnotes, and it starts with pharma, but it is the PBMs, it's 
the distributors; it is every step of the way.
    Senator Tillis. And, Mr. Chair, it is the FDA too. We 
learned so much from COVID, and we figured out how we could 
accelerate approvals under emergency use authorizations. The 
fact that we would have those snap back post-pandemic after 
they have been proven to work, to me is meaning that we are not 
learning some of the good things that came from that stress.
    The Chairman. Your point is correct.
    Senator Warren and then Senator Blackburn.
    Senator Warren. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I also 
want to say ``welcome'' to the Alzheimer's Association. I wore 
my Alzheimer's purple today. We have a very active group in 
Massachusetts, and I just want to say a special ``thank you'' 
for all of the advocacy you do on behalf of so many people we 
have lost to a terrible disease. So, thank you.
    I want to talk today also about Medicare Advantage. You 
know, every February, the Federal agency that runs the Medicare 
program releases a report outlining how Medicare Advantage or 
MA insurers are going to be paid for the following year. MA is 
a program that allows private insurance plans to offer Medicare 
benefits. Now taxpayers pay these insurance companies a set 
amount per beneficiary, and this amount can go up if the 
beneficiary is sicker.
    The more diagnosis codes that a beneficiary has, the higher 
the payment, and whatever insurers do not spend on care they 
actually get to keep. These companies have built entire 
businesses around making beneficiaries look as sick as possible 
and, unsurprisingly, government watchdogs have discovered 
widespread abuse. This year, CMS made a few updates to ensure 
that the government's payments more accurately reflect what it 
actually costs to pay for the care for beneficiaries in this 
program. And in response, the insurance industry has kicked 
into overdrive, sending an army of lobbyists to claim that the 
changes will hurt Medicare.
    So let us go through this. Let us start with the basics, 
Mr. Secretary. Under your proposal, will total payments to 
insurance plans that run Medicare Advantage go up or down?
    Secretary Becerra. Total payments will go up.
    Senator Warren. So they will go up. CMS is proposing to 
increase payments to MA plans next year. In other words, the 
insurance companies overall are going to get more taxpayer 
dollars, not fewer. But insurance companies want a lot more 
taxpayer dollars, not just a little more, so they are kicking 
and screaming, and they even shelled out millions of dollars 
for a prime time Super Bowl ad opposing the proposal. Now these 
Medicare Advantage companies are also peddling industry-funded 
studies that claim Medicare premiums would go up and benefits 
would be cut if your proposal is finalized. Mr. Secretary, are 
those claims accurate?
    Secretary Becerra. No, they are not. Benefits are not cut.
    Senator Warren. All right. So numerous experts agree with 
HHS's assessment. When Medicare Advantage was created, the 
insurance companies argued that they could provide better care 
than the Federal Government at a lower cost. But for years now, 
MA plans have been using a long list of tricks and games to 
take advantage of loopholes in the government's payment rules, 
to squeeze literally hundreds of billions of extra dollars out 
of the program.
    Researchers at the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 
profit margins for MA plans are double those for other kinds of 
insurance. In other words, because of lax rules, running 
Medicare Advantage plans is a lot, lot more profitable than 
running any other type of insurance plan, and the insurance 
companies do not want the party to end.
    Mr. Secretary, are the private insurance companies that run 
Medicare Advantage actually delivering health care for seniors 
at a lower cost than the traditional Medicare program run by 
the Federal Government?
    Secretary Becerra. The numbers show that it costs more to 
provide care to seniors in Medicare through the managed care 
Medicare Advantage program than through the traditional program 
called fee-for-service.
    Senator Warren. So the cheaper way to do this is actually 
just to run people through the Medicare program. That's not to 
say there are not some programs that work with Medicare 
Advantage, but overall, that is what the data show?
    Secretary Becerra. Yes. We are talking overall. So, if you 
lump everyone who is in the Medicare Advantage program, the 
managed care program within Medicare, and those who are in the 
traditional Medicare program called fee-for-service, the per-
beneficiary cost is higher under managed care or what we call 
Medicare Advantage.
    Senator Warren. Exactly the reverse of what they promised 
they would deliver. They said, ``Hand it over to us, and we 
will do this cheaper.'' You know in fact, according to the 
Medicare Payment Advisory Commission--which is the independent 
congressional agency that studies Medicare--the private 
insurance companies running MA have never delivered health care 
at a lower cost than traditional Medicare in the entire history 
of the program.
    So I just want to say, I urge CMS to finalize this 
proposal. I cannot get an ad on the Super Bowl, but I hope that 
having you at this hearing will have some influence on this. It 
is important to take these steps to strengthen Medicare. I also 
want to say I do not think it is enough. CMS needs to double 
down on its efforts to crack down on industry abuses in the MA 
program. I stand ready to work with you and to help you do 
that, to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries get the care that 
they have rightly earned. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Warren.
    Senator Blackburn?
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. 
Secretary, thank you for being here. I am so grateful we have 
the Alzheimer's volunteers here. We have a great group in 
Tennessee, and so--there are some back there. Love seeing them.
    But you know, Mr. Secretary, the budget that you brought to 
us, it is full of things that get in the way of research. It 
would prevent new drugs and therapies from coming to market. It 
would weaken those IP protections, and it would expand the 
government, and it is something that does cause us some 
concern.
    I want to return to the issue of telework. I know that 
Senator Cassidy discussed this with you. Adding to the list of 
how many HHS employees are working through telework, I would 
like for you to identify the essential and non-essential 
components of that list of those who are teleworking. And also, 
looking at you and your team personally, when you look at 
telework, how many days have you spent in California during 
COVID-19?
    Secretary Becerra. Thank you, Senator, for the question. 
With regard to my status, I know that requests have been made 
for my schedule, and we will try to provide as much information 
as we can.
    Senator Blackburn. Yes. I think it would be great if we 
were able to get the schedule for you, your security detail, 
and the records, expense reports, so that we could see how 
much--the reason this is important is because you are 
overseeing an agency that is the equivalent of a tenth of our 
Nation's GDP, and I think that it is vital that you be on site 
in overseeing that department. So, can you even ballpark how 
long you were in California and how often you were absent?
    Secretary Becerra. I do not get to California very often. 
When I do, it is usually because I am doing work, and I 
travel----
    Senator Blackburn. During the pandemic, because I think it 
is important that during the pandemic that you were there. And 
I want to read this back to you. In 2019, talking about the 
border crisis, you said of President Trump, and I quote, ``And 
to say that is an emergency and then within 24 hours of having 
said it, go off to Florida to your Mar-a-Lago resort, when you 
think there is a national emergency. I think all the evidence, 
including what Donald Trump says and does, proves this is no 
national emergency.'' So, by your own standard, you would 
equate COVID to not being a national emergency if you are 
spending those hours in California and being absent from the 
headquarters. It is time to get people back to work.
    Faith-based organizations. We have 8,000 faith-based 
organizations across the country that are irreplaceable members 
of the Nation's child welfare system. Senator Ossoff and I are 
going to do some bipartisan work at the Judiciary Committee on 
these issues. Tennessee relies heavily on faith-based agencies 
for services like foster care, adoption, different child and 
family services, and the recruitment of those adoptive 
families.
    Now, under your leadership, one of the first actions that 
HHS took was to rescind waivers issued by the previous 
administration, which allowed faith-based groups to place 
children with families in accordance with their sincerely held 
religious beliefs. The President's budget now proposes to 
combat sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination by 
penalizing foster care and adoption providers for operating in 
accordance with the tenets of their faith.
    So, with nearly 400,000 children in the foster care system, 
would you not agree that placing those kids in loving homes is 
a greater priority than advancing an agenda?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, thank you for the question. 
There is no doubt that being able to place any child who is in 
foster care in a loving home should be our top priority, and we 
want to make sure that that is always possible. We want to make 
sure laws are not violated that would prevent that child from 
going to a loving home.
    Senator Blackburn. Then let us do this. Let us have you 
submit how many potential foster and adoptive homes would be 
forced out of the system if the President's budget were put 
into effect on that issue.
    I want to go back--I know Senator Menendez talked to you 
about the Office of Refugee Resettlement, and this department 
is responsible for the care and placement of unaccompanied 
children who come across the U.S. border; correct?
    And are you aware of the recent New York Times article that 
really reported on the large numbers of unaccompanied children 
who are being placed with exploitative sponsors and working 
long hours in dangerous conditions?
    Secretary Becerra. I am aware of the fact that a number of 
children have been reported to be working in ways that are 
violating our law, but I am not aware of the situation you 
mentioned about being placed in exploitative circumstances. So, 
if you could clarify that a bit more for us.
    Senator Blackburn. I will be happy--Mr. Chairman, I would 
love to submit that article for the record.
    The Chairman. Without objection, so ordered.
    [The article appears in the appendix beginning on p. 165.]
    Senator Blackburn. That is wonderful. Thank you for that.
    Now the agency--The Times reported that under the Biden 
presidency, the agency cannot find 85,000 children, and that 
the agency lost contact with a third of the migrant children 
who are coming into the country. So I would like to know what 
you are doing to find the children and what you are doing to 
make certain that these children are not being trafficked?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, first, those statistics that 
you have mentioned--as I said previously in regards to another 
question by one of your colleagues--is those are unfamiliar to 
me. I have no idea where those statistics come from, if they 
are based in reality or not, and we do everything we can to 
make sure any child, before we allow them to be released to a 
sponsor, that that sponsor has been vetted. The vast majority 
of these children end up with a family member, an immediate 
family member, as a placement. So some of those statistics that 
are being thrown out there that do not seem to be based in 
fact, really would go contrary to what actually we have done.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. My time is over, but let me tell 
you, we have to get this thing straightened out. At any time, 
you had 10,500 children under your care; the money works out to 
about $1,400 a day to take care of these children, and you 
cannot find these children. We have to get it straightened out.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague. We are going to go to 
Senator Daines.
    I am just going to put one document into the record. 
Reference was made of how the notion, according to some, of 
making sure Medicare can bargain to hold down the cost of 
medicine would somehow reduce innovation and damage future drug 
creation. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked at 
this issue specifically, and estimated, their words, ``minimal 
impact of new medicines coming to market under Medicare drug 
price negotiation.''
    This was an issue very important to me, because clearly 
what we wanted was more competition without reducing 
innovation. That was the finding of the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office.*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Senator Daines?
    Senator Daines. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Mr. Secretary, 
thanks for being here today.
    There are several concerning proposals in this budget, 
including, yet again, the omission of the Hyde Amendment, to 
allow for 
taxpayer-funded abortions. It is clear the administration has 
no intention of protecting the precious lives of the unborn. In 
fact, since the Dobbs decision was first leaked in May of last 
year, over 80 pregnancy resource centers and pro-life groups 
have been attacked and vandalized, as have hundreds of churches 
that support the pro-life cause, some even in my home State of 
Montana.
    Mr. Secretary, given the continued assaults against 
pregnancy centers and churches, would you publicly condemn this 
violence? If you want to do it right here, I would be happy to 
hear it.
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, I do not believe anyone here 
would condone violence against any American, whatever the sort, 
and certainly I would hope that we could all work together to 
prevent any American from being harmed simply because they are 
either trying to exercise their rights or receive services they 
might need. So I would love to join you in sending a message to 
all Americans: please, respect people's rights, and also make 
sure that we are not abridging people's rights.
    Senator Daines. Would you publicly condemn what has 
happened? Would you condemn this violence?
    Secretary Becerra. I condemn any sort of violence against--
--
    Senator Daines. Thank you, Mr. Secretary; thank you.
    As you are aware, over 30 million seniors and people with 
disabilities in this country enrolled in the Medicare Advantage 
plans--including one quarter of Montana seniors--due to the 
added choice and control they offer beneficiaries. Rural States 
like Montana face unique challenges when it comes to recruiting 
and retaining physicians. Oftentimes, we are a long way away 
from larger communities, and the changes to the CMS HCC model 
in the proposed rate notice will further jeopardize Montanans 
access to care.
    My question is this. What data can you provide that might 
show that the current rate notice will not impede access to 
care in rural and underserved areas?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, thank you for the question, 
because it is very important. The rate notice actually provides 
a greater level of funding than last year, and what we do is, 
we try to make sure that it is funding that goes for a 
particular service, and not to line the pocket of a middle 
person in the process. What I will say to you--especially 
because of the rural communities that you represent--is, we 
need to make sure every dollar that the Medicare program puts 
out for a Medicare recipient gets to service a Medicare 
recipient.
    What we are finding is that too often, programs are gaming 
the system. And for example, as you heard earlier, some of the 
plans are claiming that a Medicare beneficiary is sicker than 
what the person may be as a result of upcoding that person. You 
get more reimbursement, even though you may not provide the 
care that a sick person under those circumstances would need.
    But what I will tell you is that, at the end of the day, 
whatever we have done with this rate notice, it does not cut 
any benefit provided by Medicare, and in fact it actually 
provides more resources to those who provide services under 
Medicare itself.
    Senator Daines. I want to shift gears and talk about 
Medicare taxes. Mr. Secretary, the President's proposed budget 
raises Medicare taxes, because the President claims to care 
about the solvency of the Medicare program, and that the 
wealthy should pay their fair share. However, there is mounting 
speculation--and this is as reported in The Wall Street 
Journal--that according to his own tax returns, the President 
improperly classified the money he made on book deals and 
speaking events, allowing him to dodge over $500,000 in 
Medicare taxes. This is again according to The Wall Street 
Journal.
    How can the President propose tax increases on Americans 
and call for the wealthy to pay their fair share, when he 
potentially owes half a million dollars in taxes to the 
Medicare program?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, let me respond on the Medicare 
program. The President's budget would make sure that, not just 
for today's seniors, that they would get the benefits they 
expected when they paid into the Medicare program for decades, 
but it actually now makes it clear that, moving forward to the 
next generation, they would receive the same level of benefits. 
There would be no cuts, and that's the beauty of the 
President's proposal. He has figured out a way to do that.
    Senator Daines. But the question is, do you not think this 
pledge to protect America's seniors might ring a bit hollow in 
light of the President's own hypocrisy of dodging $500,000 in 
Medicare taxes?
    Secretary Becerra. My suspicion, Senator, is that the 
President would challenge the way you have described his 
circumstance. But what you cannot challenge is the fact that 
his proposal actually increases benefits under Medicare, and it 
moves it forward in strengthening it for the next generation, 
something that no other President that I have seen when I was 
here in Congress for 24 years, had really done. And I have not 
yet seen anyone in Congress really produce a plan like the 
President's that would provide that guarantee for seniors of 
tomorrow, that they will have the protections they expect under 
Medicare.
    Senator Daines. Mr. Secretary, I am out of time. We lost 
our chairman.
    Okay, it looks like Chairman Casey.
    Senator Whitehouse. Chairman Casey is recognized by 
himself.
    Senator Casey. Thank you very much. Senator Whitehouse is 
letting me go ahead of him, so he gets a lot of credit.
    Mr. Secretary, great to be with you, and thank you for your 
testimony and your enduring commitment to public service. The 
members of the Alzheimer's Association are here. We are 
grateful for your presence and the determined advocacy that you 
bring to our offices year after year. We are grateful and will 
continue to work with you.
    Mr. Secretary, I want to talk to you about long-term care 
in the context of two settings. I will mention one, but I 
really want to ask you about the second. The first is in this 
broader context of what can only be described as a caregiving 
crisis when it comes to seniors, people with disabilities, and 
I would include children in that as well.
    We are in that crisis, and one of the paths forward I 
believe--not the only one--but one of the paths forwards is 
greater investment in home and community-based services, so-
called HCBS, for seniors, people with disabilities, and the 
workers who do that heroic work. I have legislation to do that 
that I know you are aware of, the Better Care Better Jobs Act, 
and we have much to do on that.
    But I want to set that aside for a moment and talk to you 
about the other setting, which is the institutional setting: 
long-term care, skilled care in a nursing home--by way of the 
leading example--and in particular the Special Focus Facility 
program that I have worked to oversee for a number of years, to 
make sure that we are investing in oversight that is 
particularly centered on those facilities that have had the 
greatest problems.
    When you look at that number, about 90 percent of nursing 
homes are not on that list. That is the good news. The bad news 
is, the 3 percent that are have real problems in terms of care. 
I was pleased to see that there is a 39-percent increase in 
funding for survey and certification activities of nursing 
homes in the President's budget. I am grateful for that, but I 
also think that more funding is needed to expand the Special 
Focus Facility program. How would additional congressional 
appropriations toward nursing home quality and oversight be 
beneficial to better protect residents in these facilities?
    Secretary Becerra. And, Senator, thank you for focusing so 
much attention on this. While I think most Americans would say 
it's great that the majority of nursing homes do not fall 
within this program, there are some that do, and they are 
Americans who are in these facilities, and we have to make sure 
that we protect them. So the money that the President proposes 
would help us do more oversight.
    It would help us do the surveillance to find out if these 
poor-
performing nursing homes are increasing services and improving 
services, and it would let us take action quickly so we can 
prevent a mishap, an accident, or perhaps death to occur in one 
of these facilities.
    Senator Casey. And I will submit a question for the record 
with regard to the plans to revise the program, the Special 
Focus Facility program.
    My second and final question is about countermeasure injury 
compensation. We know that 700 million COVID vaccines were 
administered in the country, but there are instances where 
there are injuries related to any vaccine. I know they are 
rare, but they do happen.
    I was encouraged to see that the HHS budget requested 
significant increases in funding for administering two 
programs: the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program and 
the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. I have written to 
Administrator Johnson at HRSA earlier this year about the 
Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, and I want to make 
sure that we reiterate the message from that letter: that 
individuals with these COVID-19 vaccine injury claims are 
waiting too long for adjudication.
    So we want to make sure that people are not waiting for 
years for that kind of compensation. What additional resources 
or authorities do you need in order to speed up the process and 
respond to these claimants faster?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, your help in getting that money 
across the finish line will be indispensable, because we do 
need to try to move through those backlogs. One of the things 
that we would do is, if we get additional resources, to try to 
make some process improvements in trying to get those claims 
through. So we would set up, for example, an injury table that 
lets us better target who is being harmed, what the issue is, 
and whether or not they qualify for some compensation.
    But the biggest issue right now is just having the 
wherewithal, the resources to get through the number of cases, 
because all these Americans deserve to be compensated if they 
were injured.
    Senator Casey. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
    Senator Carper. Mr. Secretary, your friends and admirers in 
the First State send their best. Thanks very much for joining 
us today.
    Last year Congress passed, and President Biden signed into 
law, the Inflation Reduction Act, as you know. It was not just 
the most significant climate legislation in this country's 
history, but also included landmark provisions to lower the 
high cost of many prescription drugs. I was happy to join a 
number of my colleagues in authoring those provisions.
    But our work to lower drug prices, as you know, is not 
done. We have a real opportunity to continue tackling the cost 
of prescription drugs through the reforms to the pharmacy 
benefit manager system. There is bipartisan interest on this 
committee--and outside of this committee--to do so.
    My colleague--our colleague and friend Senator Lankford 
brought up, I believe, PBMs earlier while I was in another 
hearing, and I want to follow up on his question. What common-
sense PBM reforms do you think should Congress--and in 
particular this committee, the Finance Committee--consider that 
will lower the cost of prescription drugs for American families 
further, and will you and your team at HHS work with us to move 
those reforms forward during this Congress?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator Carper, thank you for the 
question, and as you know, this is an area where whatever move 
or change we make, we probably will find ourselves facing a 
complaint filed in court. There is money involved in this.
    But what I will tell you is that transparency is so 
critical, to know how these middlemen are operating, so we 
understand where the money is going and how the drugs are 
getting to people who need them from the manufacturers. So I 
would say to you that we are going to try to do the work 
possible to try to increase oversight and transparency of the 
way PBMs operate.
    Senator Carper. Thank you, sir.
    I want to talk a little bit with you about implementation 
of the youth mental health provisions. When I was privileged to 
serve as Governor of Delaware, we put a public-school nurse in 
every public school. We opened up wellness centers in just 
about every high school in our State. Now we are extending 
those, as you may recall, to our middle schools and to our 
elementary schools.
    But throughout the 8 years I was privileged to serve as 
Governor, we focused on making sure that kids get the care that 
they need where they are at, in many cases in schools. Last 
Congress, I was co-chair, along with Senator Cassidy, of the 
Youth Mental Health Working Group, alongside our colleague from 
Louisiana. Several of our priorities were included in the 
bipartisan Safer Communities Act, as you may recall, including 
important provisions to make it easier for schools to provide 
mental health services to students, and to get reimbursed for 
those services under Medicaid, and I think maybe under the CHIP 
program as well.
    I understand that HHS is now in the process of implementing 
those important provisions. I would like to say, ``Find out 
what works and do more of that.'' In that spirit, could you 
just share with us some best practices from States that are 
doing a great job providing mental health services to students 
in school-based settings, so that other States can learn from 
their success?
    Secretary Becerra. And, Senator, you are right. You 
probably can identify a number of these programs that are 
really having success.
    What I will tell you is that we are trying to partner with 
those that have really gone into the schools to provide kids 
with access, early access to preventative behavioral health and 
mental health services. One of the programs we have is Project 
Aware, which really works closely with students to ensure that 
we are reaching them when they are manifesting certain issues 
regarding behavioral mental health.
    The other thing we are really going to try to push--and 
here is where we need the help of the States and Governors--is 
to see if we can get Medicaid into the schools far more deeply 
and quickly, because many of these kids would qualify for 
Medicaid services.
    Why wait until a parent applies and finds out that the 
child is eligible to receive mental health services at a 
doctor's office or a hospital when, as you mentioned, the 
beauty of having a nurse at a school and maybe having a 
behavioral health specialist at a school where you get 
reimbursed through Medicaid funding for having those 
professionals there, helps us get to those children quickly?
    Senator Carper. Yes.
    Last question is: Federally Qualified Community Health 
Centers are up, as you know, for reauthorization at the end of 
this fiscal year. As you noted in your testimony, the 
President's budget includes a pathway to double the program 
size over 5 years, and greatly expands its reach.
    I was pleased to see the President prioritize community 
health centers in his budget, as co-chair of the Senate 
Community Health Center Caucus, with several beloved centers up 
and down my State that provide critical health-care services to 
my constituents. And my question, the last question, Mr. 
Secretary, is, can you share your thoughts on maybe the top 
three areas, the top three areas, where Congress should focus 
when it comes to reauthorizing the Federally Qualified 
Community Health Center program?
    Secretary Becerra. Well, the community health centers 
really delivered. They saved lives. Tens of millions of 
Americans got their COVID shots at community health centers. 
They are the centers that are oftentimes providing dental 
health services to Americans who otherwise don't have dental 
insurance.
    And so, the two or three top priorities: expand them. There 
are parts of rural America that do not have good access to 
community health centers. Let them expand their services. Some 
do not provide OB/GYN services because they are expensive. And 
at the same time, please, please pass the President's budget on 
community health centers, because we expand the scope of 
community health centers and their funding so we can continue 
to have those great successes for so many Americans.
    Senator Carper. Good. Thank you so much.
    Mr. Chairman, I am Tom Carper, and I approve that message.
    The Chairman. Very, very, very good, and we are glad you 
are on the committee; so, thank you.
    Senator Whitehouse?
    Senator Whitehouse. Thanks very much. Thank you, Mr. 
Secretary, for being here.
    As usual, I want to bring up my graph, which we have 
updated to show that from the original CBO Federal health-care 
cost projections, this actually happened [pointing], with a 
spike obviously for COVID here, and that brings us up to today. 
In that backward-looking period in the past, that is an actual 
$2.2-trillion savings in health-care spending below what CBO 
forecast.
    And, if you bring the forecast forward, in the next 10 
years, the budget period, the projected savings are $6.9 
trillion against the extended earlier CBO projections. So that 
tells me that something is going on out there, and I think that 
it has a lot to do with the improvements in the quality of 
care, the move to value-based care, the success of Accountable 
Care Organizations, and perhaps also some of the 
pharmaceuticals that have come our way.
    But I do think that this is worth taking a good, hard look 
at, because, if we can get those kinds of savings out of the 
health-care system without taking away benefits, we should be 
all over that. I know for sure that the ACOs in Rhode Island--
Integra and Coastal Medical--hit it out of the park and 
produced significant savings, wrote big checks back to 
Medicare, and their patients loved it because the patient 
experience got so much better. So, I commend that point to you 
as I always do, and I hope we can make more progress there.
    I also want to go back to something that I have referred to 
you before, which is my efforts to try to get an end-of-life 
care model set up in Rhode Island, using the CMMI pilot. I am 
not asking the rest of the world to come with us, just let us 
try it. We have been working for years.
    This began under CMMI Director Boehler, and then when he 
left, it was Groundhog Day, and we started in with his 
successor. And then the administrations changed; it was 
Groundhog Day again, and now it is Liz Fowler. The thing that 
we have been asking for is a pool of waivers that really relate 
to things people near the end of their lives can use.
    The 3-day rule--it is preposterous to take somebody who is 
within perhaps weeks or months of dying and the family thinks 
they need to be at a nursing home, and you insist on 2 nights 
and 3 days in a hospital on the way there? That is frightening; 
that is expensive; that is, you know, just unjustifiable. So we 
would like to see that waived for people who are in that 
category.
    Curative and palliative ought to be able to proceed in 
parallel, and home health resources ought to be available. If 
you are towards the end of your life but you can still walk out 
into the garden, that should not bar you from getting home 
health services, because going elsewhere to get the services is 
more expensive and cruel to the family. So I really want to try 
to land this and try to get CMMI to say ``yes.''
    The 3-day rule you have already agreed to under COVID. It 
was waived for COVID. The curative/palliative distinction you 
waived for the Medicare Choices rule. The home health services 
you waived for CMMI models. So it is not as if I am asking you 
to do things that are not sensible and eligible and ready to 
go. I just want a package so we can land this program in Rhode 
Island that I have been working on, I think, now for 8 years. 
Would you please help me with that?
    Secretary Becerra. Very persuasive, Senator. Very, very 
persuasive. And absolutely, let me work with you on that, 
because as you said, many of these items are already in place 
or have been used.
    Senator Whitehouse. Yes, yes.
    Secretary Becerra. And I think everyone----
    Senator Whitehouse. And CMMI says ``No, you should do it 
our way.'' No. Just do it our way, right? We are going to be 
the pilot. We will put it all together. We will make it work. 
You can measure and model us. We will work with the ACOs, and 
we will do whatever they want, but I have had enough Groundhog 
Days.
    Secretary Becerra. Yes. Let us follow up, because I think 
CMS would like to get there as well. Again, we are heading in 
that direction, so let us see if we can get there with a good 
model.
    Senator Whitehouse. Thank you.
    And just because I see all the terrific purple shirts in 
the back--my Rhode Island Alzheimer's folks were in yesterday, 
and they were eager to have Medicare approve lecanemab and 
aducanumab for early onset Alzheimer's, and if there is 
anything that you can do to help facilitate that, I think that 
would be particularly helpful and welcome.
    Then, last question, we would like to try to make sure that 

medication-assisted treatment for people who have opioid 
disorders can be accomplished through telehealth. We did that 
through COVID. Can we please find ways to extend that, because 
it seems to have worked very well, at least according to 
everybody in my recovery and treatment community? That last 
part was a question. Should we do more of that? Can we keep 
doing that?
    Secretary Becerra. Yes, and there, Senator, we will work 
with you, because that goes beyond HHS. It goes into other of 
our departments as well. So it is a joint effort to work on 
that, and we can follow up.
    Senator Whitehouse. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse.
    Senator Brown? All the chairmen are here.
    Senator Brown. Mr. Secretary, nice to see you again. And, 
Senator Whitehouse, thank you for your work, especially on 
Alzheimer's. We also appreciate that.
    Secretary Becerra, as you know, the Norfolk Southern 
derailment in East Palestine--I was there again yesterday--has 
left many community members with questions. They want to know 
how the toxic exposure they and their loved ones experienced 
will affect their health.
    It is important in the process of searching for and 
receiving answers about these effects that their concerns are 
taken into account. I know some of your agencies have been 
there since the very beginning, and you are aware of that, of 
course. Thank you. I know that, moving forward, HHS will be 
heavily involved. Yesterday, on one of my trips back to East 
Palestine, I visited the mobile health clinic, set up and 
partially funded by HRSA.
    People are still coming in seeking help for symptoms 
relating to exposure, and of course they fear for the future. 
People are frustrated; they are scared. They feel like time is 
of the essence. They are afraid when the cameras leave that the 
help leaves. Can you assure me that HHS will continue to move 
with urgency in response to this disaster?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, we were there from the 
beginning; we are not leaving. And we have been on the ground, 
and as you said, we have also provided resources, for example 
to that community health clinic.
    Senator Brown. Thank you, and I know that even though the 
President did not go right away, or you did not go right away, 
your people were there and made a real difference. Thank you.
    I want to talk to you about drug pricing briefly. One of 
the victories of the Inflation Reduction Act was capping the 
Medicare copay for insulin at $35 a month. Walk through what 
that means for an average Ohio senior who needs this lifesaving 
drug.
    Secretary Becerra. For the average Ohio senior, it is 
probably about $500 they get to keep in their pocket; $500 just 
like that, because before they were paying $100 for that 
insulin a month, some paying up to $150, $200 a month. But on 
average--so some will save much more, some will save maybe a 
little less. But on average, every senior in Ohio who needs 
insulin, $500 extra in your pocket this year.
    By the way, if we had done this last year, that would have 
been $500 last year you would have kept in your pocket, and the 
year before. There is no reason why a drug that we know costs 
no more than about $10 to manufacture should be costing seniors 
$100, $200.
    Senator Brown. Thank you. That was said so very well. Thank 
you.
    Switching gears for a moment, my last question, Mr. Chair. 
I know there is a vote. Talk about Medicare Advantage, a great 
program that serves millions of beneficiaries well. I am 
concerned some seniors overpay and are not receiving the 
benefits they deserve. Some Medicare Advantage plans 
misrepresent how sick their patients are to CMS, in order to 
take more money from taxpayers.
    MedPAC says without fixing this, taxpayers and seniors will 
be paying billions of dollars more than they should be. MedPAC 
estimates it cost us over $20 billion--$20 billion--in 2023 
alone. Seniors are literally paying for this in the form of 
higher premiums. Fixing this sounds like a great way to save 
money, but I keep hearing that saving this money is bad, that 
it is going to hurt our seniors, put them in danger of having 
their benefits cut. Explain to me why that is just not true.
    Secretary Becerra. Well, Senator, it is not true because 
there is nothing that we are doing in this advance notice that 
would require any insurer to cut Medicare benefits. In fact, 
they remain the same. Those benefits must be provided by law. 
What we do is, we take out that extra charge, and we are going 
to try to get back some of the money that we were overcharged 
as a Medicare program that should have been used to provide 
more services to Medicare recipients.
    So we think it is the right thing to do, to make sure that 
every dollar that someone paid in when they were working and 
saw their deduction from their paycheck, is used to provide 
Medicare once they are retired, not to help line the pockets of 
those who are overbilling. We are going to go after any 
overbilling where we can.
    Senator Brown. Good, and I know you will, and your record 
shows that.
    So, thank you, Mr. Secretary, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague. Before he leaves, I 
just want to say ``thank you'' to Senator Brown, and then we 
will go to Senator Young, because he remembers in 2019, when we 
were in this room, and we were not going to be able to get 
everything we wanted in that bill, we came up with an anti-
price-gouging strategy to protect consumers.
    Just this week, we saw the fruits of that, because the 
administration announced lower co-insurance payments for 27 
drugs in Medicare Part B as a result of the penalties for price 
gouging, and you see it particularly with drugs like Humira, 
which is sort of a poster child for why you ought to have more 
bargaining power. So, in this room, Senator Brown was 
incredibly helpful with that, and I want to thank him.
    Senator Young?
    Senator Young. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good to be with 
you, Mr. Secretary. Welcome to the committee.
    The world is facing an antimicrobial resistance crisis. I 
know you know that super-bugs make us all more vulnerable. They 
undermine treatment of everything from common ear infections to 
cancer treatments and routine surgeries. We are seeing more 
resistance to infection right now than we ever have before, and 
blessedly there has been a lot of public attention that has 
been paid to this.
    The antimicrobial market is failing. They are hard to 
develop, and they are almost impossible to sell for at least 5 
years because of the need to hold new antimicrobials in 
reserve, to prevent resistance to those antimicrobials from 
developing. The administration has stated that drug resistance 
is a crisis, and the budget highlights a program to provide an 
incentive for novel antimicrobials, similar to the PASTEUR Act, 
which is bipartisan legislation that I have introduced with 
Senator Bennet.
    Just days later after the budget was submitted, CMS rolled 
out a list of 27 medicines that the Inflation Reduction Act is 
going to penalize for price increases. Five of them are 
antimicrobials, with prices that are overall well below the 
total expenditures of other classes of drugs, and they are 
generally used for short durations for acute infections. These 
are infused medicines, the kind that you get if there is 
nothing else available to you.
    So, Mr. Secretary, I am going to give you an opportunity to 
tell me how will penalties on these antimicrobial medicines 
help our super-bug crisis?
    Secretary Becerra. First, Senator, you are the only one who 
has asked a question about antimicrobial resistance, and I 
thank you for that, because we do not think about it, but we 
are losing the effectiveness of some of these drugs like 
penicillin, and we count on them. But because they are being 
overused or misused, we are losing the effectiveness of those 
drugs. So, thank you for posing the question.
    Secondly, remember that the only drugs that will fall on 
this list to rebate back some of the money is drugs that were 
raised beyond the rate of inflation, and they can't be new 
drugs. So these are drugs that have been on the market, and 
that manufacturer would have to explain why they had to 
increase that drug beyond the rate of inflation, in some cases 
dramatically beyond the rate of inflation.
    So we are trying to be careful here, and we are going after 
only those drugs where we see the prices being hiked 
dramatically.
    Senator Young. The price increases on these antimicrobials 
are based on relatively low overall cost, compared to many 
other disease treatments. I do not think that patients are 
going to see much benefit from the penalties that are imposed 
by the Inflation Reduction Act, if any at all.
    It seems like a pretty arbitrary penalty to me that could 
impact development of new antimicrobials, and you just 
indicated we really need to develop them.
    Secretary Becerra. And I would love to follow up with you 
any way you would like on that, because you have touched on 
something that is really important. We have to figure out a way 
to have a consistent flow of new drugs that combat bacteria, 
and as you mentioned, it is a tough business. There is not as 
much money in it as you might think, and so definitely, I am 
interested in following up with you any way you would like.
    Senator Young. Well, I am interested in working together on 
this. I know the administration, through their budget proposal, 
has indicated they support something seemingly similar to the 
PASTEUR Act. Maybe you can just share with the committee how 
that proposal, you imagine, might strengthen the antimicrobial 
pipeline.
    Secretary Becerra. Part of what we think may be in the 
solution is, rather than have a manufacturer produce a good 
drug and now try to market it and depend on the market actually 
receiving the drug and buying it, is maybe have more of a 
subscription model, where what you do is, you say to the 
industry, ``Come up with the drug,'' and like these 
subscription services, Netflix and all the rest, everybody pays 
in a little bit.
    This way there is always money in the pot, and these 
manufacturers have an incentive to go forward with their 
production and creation of the drugs, because they know that 
there will be money in the pot. Most of these manufacturers are 
afraid that there will not be a market for their drug.
    Senator Young. Sounds very similar to the PASTEUR Act, and 
all the more reason we should work together on this moving 
forward.
    Mr. Chairman, if I can just add a very quick question about 
organ procurement, something you have been such a leader on.
    The Chairman. I was just going to commend you, because 
yesterday we got some good news, that the administration is 
going to be receptive to recommendations that you and others 
worked with all of us on, to have a more competitive system and 
not just give out the contracts. So I was just getting ready to 
praise you.
    Senator Young. Oh, well, thank you. Thank you for that, and 
I will just pointedly ask the Secretary on topic here.
    The Chairman. Please, please.
    Senator Young. Getting OPO process data has been a real 
challenge. The chairman and I have both requested this data. We 
think it is consistent with our oversight responsibilities in 
ensuring that more organs are available to save more lives and 
extend lives. So will you commit to release OPO process data in 
line with the bipartisan calls from this committee?
    Secretary Becerra. Senator, we are working to change the 
way we handle organ procurement and transplantation. We are 
definitely interested in working with you on this subject, and 
I do not know if you heard, but we just announced that we are 
doing three specific things that are changing the dynamic in 
this space.
    We are going to call for more data transparency from the 
contractors. We are actually going to open up competition for 
the contract, so that the same contractor that has had this for 
years and years does not just expect that they will get the 
contract. Then we are also trying to--and the President's 
budget calls for more resources to--actually modernize our IT, 
because we are not keeping up with technology. We are losing 
time, which could be letting an organ go to waste.
    Senator Young. Those seem like the right priorities. I 
would say that I hope the OPO process data is forthcoming, 
consistent with the data transparency focus.
    Thank you so much.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    Senator Barrasso?
    Senator Barrasso. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, 
welcome back to the committee. Thanks for taking the time to be 
here.
    As you know, as a physician I know the importance of 
protecting Medicare for future generations. And stopping waste 
and fraud and abuse are critical for all of us, and it is a 
bipartisan priority.
    Late last year, I was joined by my colleagues on the 
Comprehensive Care Caucus in sending a letter to CMS. The 
purpose was to point out the proliferation of new for-profit 
hospice providers. I think about the hospices in Wyoming, such 
as Central Wyoming Hospice that I am very involved with in 
Casper. We have some around the State of Wyoming--community 
involvement, people volunteer, go to events, raise money, help, 
and these are amazing centers that provide care and comfort and 
compassion.
    Most troubling is that your own data shows the 
proliferation of these new for-profit hospices. They are 
actually sharing the exact same addresses, and we are trying to 
figure out what exactly is going on here, why this is 
happening. Do you share my concern regarding this pattern of 
this sudden growth of these Medicare-
certified hospices in certain parts of the country?
    Secretary Becerra. Absolutely, and we have actually 
conducted some unannounced site visits at some of these 
hospices that were identified in that article.
    Senator Barrasso. Yes. What are you finding out in terms 
of--are there bad actors out there or are there things we can 
do to curb them, so that we can prevent some of this waste, 
fraud, and abuse?
    Secretary Becerra. We will absolutely share some of that 
information, but no doubt what we are looking for is to find 
out if they are taking advantage of people, if they are 
defrauding the American taxpayer, and if they are abusing the 
privileges that they have by being able to provide these 
services.
    Senator Barrasso. You know, I point out there is a 
bipartisan group on this committee--and in this body--that 
wants to assist you in that and help you and share the 
information that you come up with so we can put an end to this 
sort of thing.
    Secretary Becerra. As someone who cared for his dad, 
giving, offering hospice care as best my family and I could, we 
are absolutely with you on that.
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you.
    The next is, you know rural health remains a top priority 
with me. We met today with the Wyoming Alzheimer's Association. 
There are a number of people here in the audience today 
listening to you testify, wearing the sashes representing 
family members and others with Alzheimer's. So I am encouraged 
that there is a new class of Alzheimer's treatments. It is 
giving families some hope that they may have more quality time 
with their loved ones before the disease takes hold.
    It is not a cure, but there is hope there. And we just need 
to make sure that what is available in certain locations could 
also be made available to our Tribal communities and to our 
rural beneficiaries. You know, the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services, they have a policy for coverage that is with 
evidence development, and they are requiring additional 
clinical trials or registries that could create logistical 
challenges for people in rural areas, as well as the providers 
who are trying to take care of them, because they are not all 
eligible, based on where they are.
    So how does CMS plan to ensure that those with Alzheimer's 
in rural settings and Tribal communities gain access to 
therapies which are currently FDA-approved?
    Secretary Becerra. And, Senator, I think this is where we 
all would agree we have to do more work together. But COVID 
taught us that telehealth flexibilities let us reach people 
more directly, more efficiently. We would love to keep those 
telehealth flexibilities in place. We would like to make sure 
that an actual skilled, specialized provider is available in 
these rural communities, so we are trying to expand the number 
of people who actually go into the profession. But this is 
where we can all team up together to figure out how we better 
serve our communities, especially in rural America.
    Senator Barrasso. And specifically, with FDA-approved 
drugs, unless you are part of this kind of next-generation 
follow-through, it is harder to get those, you cannot actually 
get them in rural communities, Tribal communities, based on 
your location, even though they are FDA-approved.
    Secretary Becerra. Yes. We look forward to working with you 
on that subject.
    Senator Barrasso. Then I wanted to get to rural health 
clinics. There are about 5,200 Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services certified rural health clinics. They provide 
outpatient services all across the country. The Census Bureau 
no longer defines urbanized areas--it was previously defined as 
urban areas of 50,000 or more. They have kind of changed that.
    But the rural health clinic statute requires that the rural 
health clinics must be located in areas that are not in 
urbanized areas, as defined by the Census Bureau. So they do 
not define them anymore, so there is kind of a lack of policy. 
So what we are seeing is that rural health clinic applications 
are currently being either inappropriately rejected, based on 
assumptions of what the new policy is, or blocked by States 
waiting for some clarification from CMS. I know you are aware 
of this. Could you just hold forth on that for a bit?
    Secretary Becerra. Yes. Thanks for pointing that out. CMS 
is in the process of trying to provide some guidance to clarify 
that. But Senator, I will say this. If there is a particular 
facility, clinic that believes it was denied access to funding 
and so forth as a result of what the Census Bureau did, please 
have them contact us.
    Senator Barrasso. We will do that. Thank you, Mr. 
Secretary.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Before he leaves, I just want to thank my 
neighbor. Those are important points with respect to rural 
care, and I am not aware of these for-profit hospice issues the 
way my colleague talked about them. So I would like to know 
more about those as well.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, thank you. Thanks so much, Mr. 
Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my friend.
    All right, let's see. I believe we have a couple of other 
Senators on their way. Senator Cantwell; no?
    Mr. Secretary, you have been very patient. We really 
appreciate that. What we wanted to do when we set out 3 hours 
ago, before your infinite patience, is to show that working 
families and the middle class can get ahead in this hugely 
important area.
    I have always felt, since my days when I was director of 
the Gray Panthers, if you and your loved ones do not have your 
health, everything else goes by the board. It is the most 
important issue--the most important issue. What we have set out 
to do here is to show that we can help working families and 
seniors and the middle class get ahead. And making sure we 
reduce the deficit--those two things are not mutually 
exclusive. We can do both, and we certainly showed that with 
respect to prescription drug cost containment.
    I have one other question for you, and it is as much a 
statement as anything else. We have seen the great bipartisan 
interest in this committee over the last 3 hours for advocacy 
for Alzheimer's patients, and it is just so urgent.
    I just want you to pass on to the Department--we work often 
with CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, and if you will 
just convey that I will be calling her very shortly to talk 
about how--given what we have heard today about Alzheimer's--
she can lead this effort to speed up access for Alzheimer's 
treatments and services. I think that that is----
    [Applause.]
    The Chairman. As a general rule, we are not supposed to 
advocate clapping, and so I probably have a conflict of 
interest here, so go figure. But I think, Mr. Secretary, 
seriously, we have seen how strongly the committee feels. We 
have seen how strongly the country feels. This is urgent, 
urgent business. Please, as I say, let the Administrator, Ms. 
Brooks-LaSure, who is juggling a lot of stuff and juggling it 
very well, know I will be calling her about speeding up access.
    Thank you. We will be working with you often in the days 
ahead, and I thank you for your patience this morning and your 
professionalism.
    And with that, the Committee on Finance is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:48 p.m., the hearing was concluded.]

              Additional Material Submitted for the Record

                              ----------                              


         Prepared Statement of Hon. Xavier Becerra, Secretary, 
                Department of Health and Human Services
    Chair Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of the committee, 
thank you for the opportunity to discuss the President's Fiscal Year 
(FY) 2024 budget for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 
I am pleased to appear before you today, and I look forward to 
continuing to work with you to serve the American people.

    It is my great pleasure to serve as the head of the Department of 
Health and Human Services--a department full of dedicated civil 
servants who work tirelessly to meet our mission of enhancing the 
health and well-being of the American people. We know this goal is also 
shared by all of you, and we are excited about working with you to fund 
key initiatives that will enable us to continue to meet that mission.

    The FY 2024 budget proposes $144 billion dollars in discretionary 
funding and $1.7 trillion dollars in mandatory funding to continue the 
work of the Department and make major investments in several critical 
areas. Our country faces numerous health-care challenges--and HHS is at 
the center of addressing many of these issues--including the need to 
transform behavioral health care; prepare for future public health 
threats; support unaccompanied children and refugees; protect the 
health of all Americans; meet the health needs of Indian Country; 
expand the health-care workforce; expand coverage and access to care, 
including high-quality early childhood education; improve the health 
and well-being of children, families, seniors, and people with 
disabilities; advance science to improve health; end cancer as we know 
it; and promote effective and efficient management and stewardship.
                  transforming behavioral health care
    In response to the current behavioral health crisis, HHS makes 
substantial investments in services to provide more Americans with 
access to the care they need when they need it. The 988 National 
Suicide Prevention Lifeline operates 24/7 to provide access to trained 
counselors to people in crisis. In the FY 2024 budget, the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) will dedicate 
an additional $334 million to the 988 program to meet an expected 
volume of 9 million contacts. Investing in the crisis response 
continuum more broadly is critical to ensuring that the system is 
responsive at any time and in any place. The budget builds on previous 
investments to provide $100 million for mobile crisis response to 
expand partnerships with 988 local crisis centers, community providers, 
911 centers, and first responders to promote health-first responses to 
mental health, suicidal, and substance use crisis events.

    One in 4 adults in the United States had a mental illness and 46 
million Americans had a substance use disorder in the past year.\1\ To 
address these challenges, the budget continues to invest in the 
Nation's mental health infrastructure and to further integrate 
behavioral health care into health care, social services, and early 
childhood systems. The FY 2024 budget proposes to increase the 
Community Mental Health Services Block Grant by $645 million and 
proposes to increase the Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and 
Recovery Services Block Grant by $700 million. The budget converts the 
Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics demonstration to a 
permanent program to further ensure access to comprehensive behavioral 
health care for all who need it.

Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/index.html.

    Additionally, to help build the behavioral health workforce needed 
to provide such care and services, the FY 2024 budget expands Medicare 
coverage of, and payment for, additional behavioral health professional 
services including those furnished by clinical social workers, peer 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
support workers, and certified addiction counselors.

    To develop new approaches to addressing mental health and substance 
use disorders, the FY 2024 budget includes an additional $200 million 
for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to prioritize innovative 
mental health research and treatment, with the agency allocating a 
portion of these resources to launch a new precision psychiatric 
initiative. NIH will also continue to invest over $1.8 billion in 
research on opioid misuse, addiction, and pain disorders, including the 
Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative. HEAL aims to 
develop innovative treatments for opioid addiction and chronic pain and 
associated health disparities. The budget also includes proposals to 
modernize and expand Medicare's mental health benefits and improve 
behavioral health for the private insurance market, with an emphasis on 
improving access, promoting equity, and fostering innovation.
               preparing for future public health threats
    On February 11th, HHS renewed the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency 
(PHE) for what we expect will be the final time. The Nation has made 
tremendous progress: the administration effectively implemented the 
largest adult vaccination program in U.S. history, with nearly 270 
million Americans receiving at least one shot of the COVID-19 vaccine. 
Second, we made available to the American public 1.16 billion COVID 
tests at no cost. And we were able to provide over 23 million 
therapeutic courses of treatment to Americans. According to the 
Commonwealth Fund, 2 years of COVID vaccinations saved over 3 million 
lives, in addition to preventing more than 18.5 million 
hospitalizations.

    The FY 2024 budget prioritizes preparedness for the next health 
crisis. The budget includes $20 billion in mandatory funding, available 
over 5 years, across the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and 
Response (ASPR), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and NIH to support the 
President's plan to transform the Nation's capabilities to prepare for, 
and respond rapidly and effectively to, future pandemics and other 
biological threats. This includes investments in enhancing early 
detection and warning systems, advancing, and securing safe and 
effective supplies and medical countermeasures, and strengthening 
public health systems and core capabilities. For ASPR, the budget 
includes $1 billion in discretionary funding for the Biomedical 
Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to develop 
innovative medical countermeasures, $995 million for the Strategic 
National Stockpile, and $400 million to bolster the medical supply 
chain and create medical countermeasures that address key preparedness 
gaps. The FY 2024 budget includes $10.5 billion in discretionary 
funding for the CDC to protect health, safety, and security at home and 
abroad. Additional strategic investments, including at the FDA and NIH, 
are proposed to bolster our national preparedness posture as we ready 
ourselves for the next public health threat--no matter its origin. 
These funding proposals are paired with a suite of legislative 
proposals that would provide HHS with authorities to enable HHS to 
respond to future threats nimbly and effectively.
             supporting unaccompanied children and refugees
    Children presenting at the border without a parent or guardian, and 
refugees arriving in our Nation, must be cared for in a safe and 
humanitarian manner. At HHS, we will continue to do our part to protect 
the safety and well-being of unaccompanied children by providing them 
appropriate child-centered care while they are in our custody; placing 
them in the custody of parents, relatives, and other appropriate 
sponsors after thorough vetting; and providing post-release services 
including safety and well-being calls. HHS already provides post-
release services to more than 40 percent of children released from our 
care, nearly double the percentage receiving services when the Biden 
administration took office, and is on track to provide services to 
nearly 60 percent of children by the end of this fiscal year, and all 
children within the next 2 years.

    The FY 2024 budget provides $5.5 billion for unaccompanied children 
and $1.7 billion for refugees and other new arrivals eligible for 
benefits. In addition, to address the inherent uncertainties in 
budgeting for these populations, the budget includes a discretionary 
contingency fund, which would provide additional resources if either 
population exceeded certain levels and is estimated to provide $2.8 
billion in FY 2024. The fund expands on the unaccompanied children 
contingency fund that Congress enacted in FY 2023. These services and 
resources are critical to our country, and I would like to thank 
Congress for your continued dedicated support.
                 protecting the health of all americans
    The administration aims to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, 
through proposals such as the ``Birthing-Friendly'' hospital 
designation, which drives improvements in maternal health outcomes. The 
budget includes $1.9 billion for the Health Resources and Services 
Administration (HRSA) Maternal and Child Health programs, an increase 
of $205 million, directing $276 million toward reducing maternal 
mortality and morbidity and $185 million to the Healthy Start program 
to reduce racial disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes. 
The budget also provides $30 million for NIH to continue the 
Implementing a Maternal Health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for 
Everyone (IMPROVE) initiative to support research focused on 
interventions for preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and 
associated risk factors that contribute to health disparities in 
maternal care. The budget further includes $3 million for NIH's 
continued research on the effects of COVID-19 on individuals during 
pregnancy, lactation, and the postpartum period. The budget also 
requires states to provide 12 months of postpartum coverage through 
Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.

    HHS is also committed to protecting and strengthening access to 
reproductive health care. The budget provides $512 million to the title 
X family planning program to address the increased need for family 
planning services for approximately 4.5 million individuals, with 90 
percent having family incomes at or below 250 percent of the Federal 
poverty level. Title X is the only Federal grant program solely 
dedicated to providing individuals with comprehensive family planning 
and related preventive health services in communities across the United 
States.

    In 2022, HHS released the Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan, 
which provides a framework to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public 
health threat in the United States by 2030. The Viral Hepatitis Plan 
focuses on hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C--the three most 
common hepatitis viruses that have the most impact on the health of the 
Nation. The Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan is the first to aim 
for elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat in the 
United States. Building on this work, the FY 2024 budget includes $11.3 
billion for a new HHS-wide proposal to establish a 5-year national 
program to significantly expand screening, testing, treatment, 
prevention, and monitoring for hepatitis C infections. This program 
would increase access to tests and curative medicines and expand public 
health efforts, with a net cost of $5.1 billion over 10 years once 
accounting for health improvements and reduced health-care spending. 
Continuing this work is vital to protecting and improving the lives of 
Americans who are impacted by this serious disease.

    Health Centers provide health-care services to underserved 
populations across the country, including low-income patients, ethnic 
minorities, rural communities, and persons experiencing homelessness. 
The budget proposes a pathway to doubling the program's funding with a 
critical 3-year down payment on this goal. The FY 2024 budget provides 
$7.1 billion for Health Centers, which includes $5.2 billion in 
proposed mandatory resources, an increase of $1.3 billion above FY 2023 
enacted. At this funding level, the Health Center Program will provide 
care for approximately 33.5 million patients.

    The FY 2024 budget also makes critical investments to establish 
Vaccines for Adults program within CDC, as a complement to the 
successful Vaccines for Children program. The Vaccines for Adults 
program will begin expanding access to routine and outbreak response 
vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices for uninsured adults at no cost.
               meeting the health needs of indian country
    HHS is committed to upholding the United States' responsibility to 
Tribal nations by addressing the historic underfunding of the Indian 
Health Service (IHS). Building on the historic passage of advance 
appropriations for the IHS in FY 2023, the FY 2024 budget proposes $8.1 
billion in discretionary funding for the IHS Services and Facilities 
accounts, an increase of $2.2 billion above FY 2023 enacted. This 
funding will expand access to healthcare services for 2.8 million 
American Indians and Alaska Natives, address key operational capacity 
needs, and modernize outdated facilities and information technology 
systems. The budget also includes $1.6 billion in proposed mandatory 
funding in FY 2024 for Contract Support Costs, payments for section 
105(l) Tribal leases, and the Special Diabetes Program for Indians.

    Beginning in FY 2025, the budget proposes all IHS resources as 
mandatory. The budget would automatically grow IHS funding each year to 
account for inflationary factors, population growth, key programmatic 
needs, and existing backlogs in both health-care services and 
infrastructure needs. The mandatory funding approach would ensure that 
the IHS budget grows sufficiently to both address historic 
underinvestment and expand capacity for increased service provision. It 
also includes new funding streams to address key gaps, including the 
lack of dedicated funding for public health infrastructure in Indian 
Country. HHS firmly believes that mandatory funding is the most 
appropriate long-term solution to address chronic underinvestment in 
IHS. The Department will continue consultation with Tribes and working 
in partnership with Congress to see this important goal realized. While 
this work is underway, it is critical that Congress continues to 
provide discretionary advance appropriations to ensure that the 
critical advancements achieved through enactment of advance 
appropriations in the FY 2023 Omnibus are not reversed.
              expanding and retaining the health workforce
    The health workforce plays a vital role in responding to public 
health needs. As the demand for health-care workers increases, HHS 
remains committed to strengthening, expanding, and retaining the 
workforce. The FY 2024 budget provides $2.7 billion for HRSA workforce 
programs, including $947 million in mandatory resources, to expand 
workforce capacity across the country. The discretionary budget 
includes $28 million for a new program to support innovative approaches 
to address health-care workforce shortages and strengthen retention 
efforts. The budget also provides $25 million for a program to support 
the adoption of workplace wellness in health-care facilities including 
hospitals, rural health clinics, community health centers, and medical 
professional associations. The budget includes $106 million within CDC 
to support public health training and fellowship programs to strengthen 
the existing workforce as well as support a pipeline of personnel ready 
and able to address public health threats. In addition to these 
investments, HHS prioritizes the importance of diversifying the health-
care workforce to better serve all communities and build a more 
equitable health-care system.
                 expanding coverage and access to care
    It is ever more crucial to promote the health, safety, and dignity 
of older adults and people with disabilities, particularly as America's 
older population increases. The FY 2024 budget makes essential 
investments to strengthen our Nation's long-term care system and 
invests $150 billion over 10 years to improve Medicaid home and 
community-based services, to ensure that more people who are aging and 
those with disabilities can receive care in their home or community and 
to strengthen the home care workforce. President Biden also issued a 
call to action to improve the quality of America's nursing homes, and 
HHS continues to take action to ensure that older adult nursing home 
residents receive the highest quality care. The FY 2024 budget includes 
multiple provisions to strengthen nursing home oversight, transparency, 
and enforcement, including $566 million for surveying and inspections. 
The provisions protect older adult residents by identifying and 
penalizing nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, 
and/or prescribe unnecessary drugs.

    Since the passage and subsequent expansions of the Affordable Care 
Act, tens of millions of Americans have gained access to quality health 
insurance through the marketplace. To build on this success, the FY 
2024 budget invests in making private insurance even more affordable. 
This includes new proposals to build on historic progress made in 
Congress, including a permanent extension of the enhanced premium tax 
credits in Pub. L. 117-169, commonly known as the Inflation Reduction 
Act. The budget proposes to extend protections from the No Surprises 
Act to ground ambulances. The FY 2024 budget also provides Medicaid-
like coverage to low-income individuals in States that have not 
expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, paired with financial 
incentives to ensure states maintain their existing expansions.
            improving the well-being of children, families, 
                 seniors, and people with disabilities
    Early childhood programs have a return of up to $9 for every $1 
spent due to the positive long-term health, educational, and social 
impacts on vulnerable children. The budget includes $13 billion for 
Head Start, an increase of $1.1 billion, to provide comprehensive early 
learning and development services to roughly 760,156 slots for eligible 
children and pregnant women. Within this total, $440 million is 
included for a cost-of-living adjustment for Head Start workers, and 
$575 million is included to further improve compensation. Collectively, 
these investments ensure that families have access to high-quality 
services by retaining and supporting the workforce. In addition, the 
budget includes a legislative proposal to expand tribal, migrant, and 
seasonal Head Start eligibility.

    The budget likewise invests in child care, critical to both working 
parents, and particularly to mothers and children. For the 
discretionary Child Care and Development Block Grant, the budget 
provides for an investment of $9 billion, an increase of nearly $1 
billion over the FY 2023 enacted funding level. In addition, the budget 
includes a mandatory proposal to invest $400 billion over 10 years in 
high-quality child care, and $200 billion over 10 years in universal 
preschool.

    The $400 billion in mandatory funding over 10 years for high-
quality child care includes funding for States to serve children ages 
zero to five for families earning up to $200,000. It provides higher 
Federal matching funds for child care providers serving low- and 
middle-income families and allows those families to pay the lowest 
copays--with a goal of ensuring that the lowest income families pay 
nothing and that most families pay no more than $10 a day per child, 
meaning that a median-income family with young children saves about 
$400 per month while accessing higher-quality care. The 
administration's proposal enables States to expand access to 
affordable, high-quality child care to more than 16 million children. 
This reflects an expectation that all States will choose to adopt the 
program but, if some States do not, the administration is committed to 
serving low-income children through a Federal alternative.

    The $200 billion in mandatory funding over 10 years for universal 
preschool supports free preschool in the setting of a parent's choice--
from public schools to child care providers to Head Start--to support 
healthy child development and ensure that children enter kindergarten 
ready to succeed. The proposal provides funding through a Federal-State 
partnership to expand high-quality preschool education to all 4-year-
old children, with the flexibility for States to expand preschool to 3-
year-olds once high-quality preschool is fully available to 4-year-old 
children. The proposal also includes funding to provide access to 
preschool to children in underserved communities in States that do not 
choose to participate in the new preschool program, so that families in 
every State have access to high-quality preschool.

    To further protect and enhance child well-being, the budget also 
includes $4.9 billion in mandatory funding over 10 years for prevention 
services and kinship navigator programs, $1.3 billion in mandatory 
funding over 10 years to give States an incentive to place children 
with kin, and $1 billion in mandatory funding over 10 years for support 
for youth who experienced foster care in transitioning to adulthood.

    The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that millions of children, families, 
seniors, and people with disabilities are living with food insecurity. 
The increased need for nutrition programs has not abated, and the FY 
2024 budget supports the administration's National Strategy on Hunger, 
Nutrition, and Health by including $137 million across HHS to reduce 
hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition. Within the $137 million, the 
budget includes $12 million at the Administration for Community Living 
(ACL) for nutrition services for older adults and people with 
disabilities and $72 million to expand CDC's State Physical Activity 
and Nutrition program, which implements evidence-based strategies to 
reduce chronic disease. In addition, the budget proposes to increase 
funding at NIH for nutrition research. The budget also expands Medicare 
coverage for nutrition and obesity counseling, and includes a new pilot 
project on medically tailored meals.

    HHS is committed to ensuring that seniors and people with 
disabilities have the essential resources and services they need. The 
FY 2024 budget also makes key investments in the Elder Justice Adult 
Protective Services program. And, to help more older adults and those 
with disabilities receive care in their home or community. As noted 
above, the budget also includes a $150 billion mandatory investment 
over 10 years in improving and strengthening Medicaid home and 
community-based services and provisions to improve safety and quality 
in our Nation's nursing homes.

    The budget extends the solvency of the Medicare hospital insurance 
trust fund by at least 25 years without cutting benefits. The budget 
builds on efforts in the Inflation Reduction Act to lower prescription 
drug prices. It also invests $8 billion to enhance Medicare benefits, 
such as preventing diabetes, expanding access to behavioral health 
services and community health workers, improving the quality and safety 
of long-term care services, expanding coverage for nutrition and 
obesity counseling, eliminating hepatitis C, and advancing equity. 
Additionally, the budget aligns income and asset determination 
processes for Medicare low-income assistance programs, easing 
administrative burdens for States and removing enrollment barriers for 
individuals.
                  advancing science to improve health
    As President Biden has said, ``cancer does not care if you're a 
Republican or a Democrat,'' which is why the President and First Lady 
reignited the Cancer Moonshot 1 year ago. HHS is committed to leading 
the public sector in pursuit of cutting the cancer death rate by 50 
percent over the next 25 years and supporting families, their 
caregivers and family members, living with and surviving cancer.

    NIH will continue to build on the Cancer Moonshot's momentum by 
supporting projects that will deliver important insights into 
preventing, detecting, and treating cancer. The FY 2024 budget includes 
$716 million in discretionary resources for dedicated Cancer Moonshot 
activities at NIH. In addition to the FY 2024 resources, the budget 
also proposes to reauthorize the 21st Century Cures Act Cancer Moonshot 
through 2026 and provide $2.9 billion in mandatory funding in 2025 and 
2026, $1.45 billion each year. To support the goals of the Cancer 
Moonshot, the FY 2024 budget includes an additional $183 million for a 
total of $839 million to support cancer prevention and control programs 
across CDC, including screening programs, tobacco prevention, Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) prevention and analysis of cancer clusters, and 
laboratory and environmental health activities. An additional 
investment of $20 million for HRSA is also provided, to expand 
partnerships between federally funded health centers and NCI-Designated 
Cancer Centers to facilitate access to lifesaving cancer screenings and 
early detection services for medically underserved populations. The 
budget also includes $108 million within IHS to address specialized 
cancer care needs in tribal communities. The budget also proposes to 
create a new Cancer Care Quality Reporting Program for all Medicare 
providers furnishing cancer care services. This unified program would 
enable the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to assess 
and compare cancer care delivered through multiple provider types, 
drive improvements in the quality of cancer care, and standardize data 
collection to identify and address potential inequities in care.

    The FY 2024 budget includes several investments for FDA to support 
food programs including $20 million for the Emerging Chemicals and 
Toxicology Issues program to streamline regulatory frameworks for food 
products that may pose chronic risks to human health. Funds support 
post-market reassessment of previously approved food chemicals and 
develop approaches to inform and modernize safety assessments using 
science and risk-based approaches. An additional investment of $5 
million is provided for the 21 Forward food supply chain continuity 
system, which enables the agency to develop accurate models for 
situational awareness and forecast the impact of a pandemic, product 
shortages, or other high-risk threats on the food supply chain. Within 
medical product safety, the budget dedicates a total of $59 million to 
continue efforts that strengthen public health supply chains and 
promote the availability of medical devices by proactively monitoring, 
assessing, and communicating risks and vulnerability.

    The budget will prioritize innovative mental health research and 
treatment and the NIH climate change initiative. NIH will continue to 
invest funds to address the opioid crisis, end HIV, and advance other 
research areas, such as improving health disparities and inequities 
research, as well as continuing the agency's progress towards a 
universal influenza vaccine. NIH's budget also continues support for 
the All of Us and Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative 
Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiatives, both started with the 21st 
Century Cures Act.

    The budget also invests in high-impact research advances that drive 
innovation through the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health 
(ARPA-H). As an independent research entity, ARPA-H will be able to 
accelerate health breakthroughs with the potential to transform 
important areas of health and medicine. The budget provides $2.5 
billion for the agency's approach to prevent, detect, and treat cancer 
and other diseases such as diabetes and dementia. ARPA-H will advance 
high-
potential, high-impact biomedical and health research that cannot be 
readily accomplished through and other existing research or commercial 
activity.

    In keeping with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's 
(AHRQ) mission to provide evidence-based research, data, and tools to 
improve health-care quality, the FY 2024 budget includes $564 million 
to support AHRQ's research on quality, health costs, and outcomes to 
make health care safer, more accessible, equitable, and affordable for 
all Americans. Included are additional resources to further Long COVID 
care, primary care, and diagnostic safety research.
      promoting effective and efficient management and stewardship
    As Federal stewards, it is our duty to ensure that taxpayer dollars 
are spent appropriately through the delivery of high-quality services, 
through necessary security, and through strong action to prevent fraud 
and abuse. To protect against information technology threats, the 
budget provides an increase of $88 million above FY 2023 enacted for 
cybersecurity initiatives in the Office of the Chief Information 
Officer (OCIO). Due to the increasing frequency of cyber-attacks that 
impede the delivery of health care and leak private patient health 
information, the ASPR and OCIO budgets have been increased to 
understand, mitigate, and identify Health-care and Public Health (HPH) 
Sector cybersecurity risks, as well as, to prevent, detect, respond, 
and recover from HPH cyber-attacks.

    The budget makes robust investments in the Health Care Fraud and 
Abuse Control funding to provide oversight of CMS health programs, 
strengthen the HHS Office of Inspector General investigations, and 
protect beneficiaries against health-care fraud. Our comprehensive 
program integrity legislative package and allocation adjustment yields 
$19.7 billion in net savings over 10 years. The Office of Civil Rights 
would receive significant additional funding to address a sharp rise in 
its caseload, from 45,000 cases in 2020 to a projected 80,000 in 2024. 
Finally, the budget includes much-needed investment in core 
infrastructure, oversight, and operations, including in the 
Nonrecurring Expenses Fund, General Departmental Management, CMS 
Program Management, and ACL.
                               conclusion
    I want to thank the committee for inviting me to discuss the 
President's FY 2024 budget for HHS. The budget represents the continued 
investment in the health, growth, protection, and vitality of the 
American people. With adequate funding in these critical areas, we can 
support the forward mobility of our country and continue to make stride 
towards a brighter future. Thank you for your dedication and 
partnership in our shared goal to improve the health, safety, and well-
being of our Nation.

                                 ______
                                 
       Questions Submitted for the Record to Hon. Xavier Becerra
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
                      hospital price transparency
    Question. On January 1, 2021, Federal Hospital Price Transparency 
regulations went into effect. Federal hospital price transparency rules 
require each hospital to make public the standard charges for items and 
services they provide. Hospitals are required to make standard charges 
public through a consumer-friendly display consisting of at least 300 
shoppable services and a comprehensive, machine readable file. During 
the second year of hospital price transparency rules, CMS reviewed 600 
randomly selected hospitals, and 70 percent of hospitals met the 
requirements. As of January 2023, CMS sent nearly 500 warning notices 
and 230 requests for corrective action plans. Nearly 300 hospitals 
addressed noncompliance. CMS issued civil monetary penalties against 
only two hospitals for failure to come into compliance. It is critical 
for CMS to ensure compliance with hospital price transparency rules to 
help patients shop for information, to provide researchers information 
to analyze variation in charges, and to help employers negotiate more 
competitive rates.

    Which metrics does CMS use to define compliance with Federal 
hospital price transparency requirements? Does this account for 
differences between CMS's assessment of compliance and studies 
conducted by third parties?

    How does CMS define a shoppable service?

    What are some of the challenges accessing data that are not 
publicly available to determine compliance?

    What is CMS's timing for requiring compliance with a standardized 
hospital price transparency template?

    Will CMS post publicly information about hospitals that are issued 
a written warning notice and have to complete a corrective action plan 
to come into compliance with hospital transparency rules?

    Does CMS have plans to provide a more detailed compliance analysis 
to capture more hospitals? Would this require additional funding from 
Congress?

    Answer. Enforcing the hospital price transparency requirements is a 
high priority for CMS in order to increase competition and bring down 
costs. It is imperative that consumers can access cost information to 
shop for care and save money and for employers to use data to negotiate 
more competitive rates. After significant outreach and technical 
assistance to hospitals, hospitals have made substantial progress since 
January 2021.
Compliance Analyses
    CMS's Hospital Price Transparency compliance analyses focus on 
aspects of the regulation that can be unambiguously determined by 
looking at the data posted by the hospital on its website. CMS's 
analysis aligns closely with many other external assessments. CMS 
evaluates according to the regulatory requirements. For example, the 
fact that there is no specific negotiated charge associated with a 
particular service--e.g., deep brain stimulation, a commonly performed 
surgical treatment for Parkinson's disease--may mean that the hospital 
has not in fact established a negotiated rate for that procedure 
because it just does not offer that type of neurosurgery, or it may 
signal the omission of required information and indicate noncompliance. 
That type of information--whether or not the hospital is actually 
offering the service--is the type of information that is gleaned during 
the comprehensive compliance review in the back and forth between a 
hospital and CMS.

    CMS's compliance assessments thus far were done primarily to 
understand and quantify the general state of hospital compliance, in 
support of our policy and enforcement activities. Beyond the initial 
proactive assessment (done in early January 2021), CMS has been 
systematically working through the high volume of complaints submitted 
by the public through the website. As of January, 2023, CMS has issued 
nearly 500 warning notices and over 230 requests for corrective action 
plans. 300 hospitals have addressed problems and have become compliant 
with the regulations, leading to closure of their cases, including the 
2 hospitals which we have issued civil monetary penalties.
Shoppable Service
    The Hospital Price Transparency regulations define a shoppable 
service as ``a service that can be scheduled by a health-care consumer 
in advance.''\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ 45 CFR part 180--Hospital Price Transparency, https://
www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-E/part-180.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standardized Data
    CMS continues to work to improve the collection and display of 
standardized data, including by holding a listening session to discuss 
ways to display information for consumers, and by encouraging hospitals 
to format and validate their data sets. In an effort to assist 
hospitals in complying with the requirements under the Hospital Price 
Transparency regulations and also providing consistency in how those 
disclosures are viewed by consumers, CMS has made available several 
sample formats using a standardized set of data elements that hospitals 
may use to make public their standard charges. CMS also has finalized a 
requirement that the machine-readable file be accessible to automated 
searches and direct downloads. Further, CMS has clarified that the 
estimate from a price estimator tool, voluntarily used by the hospital 
in lieu of making public a consumer-friendly list of standard charges, 
must be tailored to individuals' circumstances and represent a real-
time individualized out-of-pocket estimate of the amount they would 
have to pay the hospital that takes into account any applicable benefit 
information.
Enforcement
    In CMS's enforcement of the hospital price transparency rules, the 
agency's goal is to increase access to useful, meaningful information 
for consumers and ensure hospitals are following through on their 
obligations to make information available. CMS is working closely with 
hospitals to bring them into compliance, and the agency in the process 
of examining further improvements to the program, including ways that 
CMS enforcement could be used to increase compliance.
                          digital therapeutics
    Question. The President's FY 2024 budget includes a legislative 
proposal to establish Medicare coverage of evidence-based digital 
applications and platforms that facilitate the delivery of mental 
health services, especially for beneficiaries who live in rural or 
health professional shortage areas. As the Senate Committee on Finance 
continues to advance legislation to address barriers to mental health 
care and use innovative tools to address mental health workforce 
shortages, it will be important to gain additional detail on this 
proposal.

    Is it possible for Medicare to establish coverage for these digital 
applications and platforms (hereinafter ``apps'') via existing national 
or local coverage determination processes?

    Would this FY 2024 budget proposal require the creation of a new 
benefit category in Medicare, or could coverage for these digital apps 
and platforms be incorporated into an existing Medicare benefit?

    Does HHS or CMS have any criteria that Congress should consider for 
determining the scope of digital apps and platforms that should be 
covered by Medicare? Would information sharing between the apps and a 
patient's physician or mental health provider be a required aspect of 
the operation of Medicare-covered digital apps and platforms?

    Would Medicare payment for the digital apps and platforms be built 
into an existing Medicare payment system or would a new payment system 
need to be created?

    If Medicare payment for digital apps and platforms were added 
within an existing Medicare payment system, which payment system would 
be used?

    In CMS's view, how have innovations without defined benefit 
categories made their way into the standard reimbursement structure?

    Answer. Thank you for your interest in expanding access to digital 
technologies in Medicare. As you noted, President Biden's Fiscal Year 
2024 budget includes a proposal that would allow for Medicare coverage 
of evidence-based digital applications and platforms that facilitate 
greater access to behavioral health services, especially for 
beneficiaries who live in rural or health professional shortage 
areas.\2\ If you are interested in drafting legislation to address 
Medicare's coverage of digital technologies, CMS would be happy to 
provide technical assistance.

    adoption and foster care analysis and reporting system (afcars)
    Question. The President's budget does not include proposals to 
improve the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System 
(AFCARS) to address longstanding concerns about the over-representation 
and lack of equitable treatment of LGBTQ+ and Native American children 
and youth in the child welfare system. As you know, AFCARS requires 
reporting on key metrics with the goal of understanding trends in child 
welfare and improving outcomes for children and youth.

    Will the Children's Bureau be promulgating a rule to address gaps 
in data collection concerning LGBTQ+ and Native American children and 
youth to capture existing disparities in the child welfare system and 
improve outcomes for children in foster care?

    If so, when can we expect to see a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking?

    Answer. The Fall 2022 Unified Agenda lists an AFCARS NPRM.\3\ HHS 
is committed to the equitable treatment of all youth in the child 
welfare system and to address longstanding disparities particularly for 
LGBTQI+ and Native American youth. We expect that the Unified Agenda 
for the Spring of 2023 will again include an AFCARS NPRM.

  Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden and Hon. Robert P. Casey, Jr.
                  nursing home emergency preparedness
    Question. On February 23 2023, Chairman Wyden, along with Chairman 
Casey of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, issued a report 
(https://www.finance.
senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-casey-examine-long-term-care-
shortfalls-during-texas-winter-blackout) titled, ``Left in the Dark,'' 
which examined the impacts of the 2021 Texas blackout on nursing homes 
and the need for robust emergency preparedness in long-term care 
facilities. This report tells the story of the older adults and people 
with disabilities living in long-term care facilities, including 
skilled nursing facilities or nursing facilities participating in the 
Medicare and/or Medicaid programs, who were affected by the 2021 Texas 
winter storm and subsequent blackout. The report also shines a light on 
other disasters that have affected nursing homes in more than a dozen 
States since 2018, including our home States of Oregon and 
Pennsylvania. Lastly, the report also highlights troubling findings by 
the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, 
which identified serious emergency preparedness shortfalls at nursing 
homes in eight States. This work built on Chairman Wyden's 2018 report 
(https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-
members-news/wyden-finds-nursing-homes-unprepared-for-natural-
disasters), ``Sheltering in Danger,'' that examined the impacts that 
Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had on nursing homes in Texas and Florida, 
respectively.

    The report issued eight new recommendations for Federal, State and 
local governments to improve emergency preparedness in long-term care 
facilities. The findings and recommendations of this report are 
critical as the number of disasters and extreme weather events 
affecting our Nation increases, a trend scientists attribute to climate 
change. We ask that HHS detail how it plans to address and carry out 
each of the recommendations the report directs to it, which are listed 
below for convenience.

        A.  Improve Inclusivity of Disaster Planning, Preparedness and 
        Management in Communities: CMS, the Department of Homeland 
        Security, States and local governments should ensure that older 
        adults, people with disabilities and residents of long-term 
        care facilities are substantially involved in emergency 
        planning, response, mitigation, management, and recovery. 
        Congress should pass the Real Emergency Access for Aging and 
        Disability Inclusion (REAADI) for Disasters Act, which would 
        ensure that people with disabilities and older adults have a 
        voice at every stage of disaster management through 
        representation on emergency preparedness planning councils and 
        boards; require accessible information about planning for 
        disasters; and make sure that shelters and temporary housing 
        are accessible to older adults and people with cognitive, 
        sensory, and physical disabilities. In addition, States and 
        local governments should seek to include older adults and 
        people with disabilities as members of emergency preparedness 
        oversight committees and advisory panels.

        B.  Improve Staffing--Nursing Homes: CMS should promulgate 
        mandatory minimum staffing standards for Skilled Nursing 
        Facilities and Nursing Facilities following completion of its 
        study to determine the level of staffing necessary to ensure 
        safe and high-quality care. Congress should pass provisions in 
        the Nursing Home Improvement and Accountability Act of 2021 
        targeted at improving staffing, such as providing additional 
        Federal resources through Medicaid to increase wages and 
        improve recruitment and retention of staff. Research has 
        repeatedly linked low staffing levels in nursing homes to poor 
        quality care and patient safety violations. Increasing staff 
        levels and reducing staff turnover would better equip nursing 
        homes to respond to emergencies.

        C.  Increase the Transparency of Emergency Plans: CMS should 
        evaluate the feasibility of requiring nursing homes to provide 
        residents and their families with copies of the facility's 
        emergency preparedness plan during intake, and once annually 
        after the facility has completed the federally required update 
        of its emergency plan. CMS should also evaluate the feasibility 
        of posting emergency plans on Care Compare to make them easily 
        accessible for people considering nursing homes for themselves 
        or their loved ones.

        D.  Incorporate Climate Change Risks Into Emergency 
        Preparedness: CMS should evaluate the feasibility of requiring 
        nursing homes to incorporate climate change risks, such as the 
        increasing incidence of extreme weather events, into emergency 
        preparedness planning. If deemed feasible, CMS should issue 
        regulations and guidance that directs nursing homes to consider 
        the effects of climate change into their all-hazards 
        assessment. Such requirements would be in line with findings 
        from the most recent National Climate Assessment, which was 
        mandated by Congress in 1990. The climate assessment notes that 
        ``over decades or longer, emergency preparedness and disaster 
        risk reduction planning can benefit from incorporating climate 
        projections to ensure communities are prepared for changing 
        weather patterns.''

        E.  Incorporate Renewable Energy Into Emergency Preparedness: 
        CMS and States should ensure emergency power requirements for 
        nursing homes offer flexibility for facilities to use clean 
        energy for secondary emergency power sources, particularly as 
        costs of renewable energy and energy storage continue to 
        decline. CMS should work with the Internal Revenue Service and 
        Department of Energy to offer guidance that educates nursing 
        homes about the availability of Federal tax credits, financing 
        and grants that further reduce the costs of installing clean 
        energy resources and improving energy efficiency through 
        provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, and other programs.

        F.  Ensure Equitable Emergency Preparedness: CMS should conduct 
        a study that examines the equity of emergency preparedness in 
        and among nursing homes. Such a study should consider factors 
        such as payer mix of residents, racial and ethnic makeup of 
        residents, the percentage of residents reliant on long-term 
        services and supports, geographic location, climate change 
        risks, and the social vulnerability index of the community 
        where facilities are located. CMS should use the study to 
        evaluate ways in which the agency and State partners can 
        improve emergency preparedness for people of color, people 
        living in poverty, and people with disabilities who live in 
        nursing homes.

    Answer. Protecting the health and safety of nursing home residents 
is highest priority of the OIG. OIG has long identified ensuring 
quality of care in nursing homes as among the Department's top 
management and performance challenges. While many nursing homes provide 
excellent care, decades of OIG oversight and enforcement have revealed 
persistent, entrenched problems in nursing homes ranging from 
preventable harm to residents to failed emergency preparedness to and 
gaps in available consumer information, among others. Currently, OIG 
has a number of audits and evaluations underway to examine emergency 
preparedness in nursing homes. Below are some examples of ongoing work:

        Resident Care During Emergencies (https://oig.hhs.gov/reports-

        summary-0000508.asp).

    CMS appreciates Chairman Wyden's and Chairman Casey's leadership on 
the critical issue of emergency preparedness in nursing homes. The 
investigation by the majority staffs of the U.S. Senate Finance 
Committee and the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, ``Left in the 
Dark: The impact of the 2021 Texas Blackout on Long-Term Care Residents 
and the Need to Improve Emergency Preparedness,'' is an urgent request 
for all long-term care facilities to prepare to protect their residents 
in emergencies no matter the cause of the emergency. As the 
investigation notes, while the timing and type of disasters cannot 
always be predicted, the risks can be anticipated and prepared for 
through robust assessments and plans, frequent training, and 
maintenance of equipment and supplies.

    Improving the inclusivity of disaster planning and preparedness to 
better meet the unique needs of older adults and people with 
disabilities, whether they live in the community or a long-term care 
facility, is an HHS priority. Involving the aging and disability 
communities in all stages of disaster planning, preparedness, response 
and recovery is critical to improving the outcomes for these 
populations when disasters strike.

    Monitoring patient safety and quality of care in nursing homes 
requires coordinated efforts between the Federal Government and the 
States. Through its survey and certification efforts, CMS works in 
partnership with State survey agencies to oversee nursing homes and 
hold them accountable to Medicare and Medicaid Conditions of 
Participation requirements to ensure safety and quality of care. 
Additionally, the ACL Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program advocates for 
older adults and persons with disabilities in long-term care facilities 
to ensure their rights are protected and any concerns related to 
health, safety, and quality of life are addressed. Ombudsmen resolve 
individual complaints, while also advocating for systemic improvements. 
In 2021, ombudsmen representatives worked on 164,299 resident 
complaints.

    Under CMS requirements, long-term care facilities are required to 
develop and maintain an emergency preparedness program that includes an 
emergency plan, policies and procedures, a communication plan, training 
and testing programs, and emergency and standby power systems. Long-
term care facilities must establish policies and procedures that 
determine, among other things, how required heating and cooling of 
their facility will be maintained during an emergency situation if 
there were a loss of the primary power source. CMS took significant 
steps to update its emergency preparedness guidance for long-term care 
facilities in 2019, and in 2021, and will use the investigation's 
findings as we consider additional changes that may be needed to 
protect nursing home residents during emergencies.

    The committees recommend that CMS should issue mandatory minimum 
staffing standards for long-term care facilities. In February 2022, 
President Biden announced a comprehensive set of reforms to improve the 
safety and quality of nursing home care and hold nursing homes 
accountable for the care they provide. CMS has launched a multifaceted 
approach aimed at determining the minimum level and type of staffing 
needed to enable safe and quality care in nursing homes. CMS intends to 
issue its proposal for minimum staffing requirements using the notice-
and-comment rulemaking process--providing further opportunities for all 
interested parties to weigh in.

    The investigation also calls on Congress to increase funding for 
survey and certification activities. Annual survey and certification 
budgetary funding levels have been flat since FY 2015 while survey 
workloads and costs continue to increase due to factors such as a 
growing number of beneficiaries and surveyor wage growth, as well as an 
increase in serious complaints against facilities. CMS strongly 
supports this call for additional survey and certification activities.

    As CMS is continually reviewing our programs for improvement, we 
will consider the investigation's recommendations so that long-term 
care facilities are held accountable for emergency preparation. No 
facility should be caught unprepared for an emergency and residents and 
workers must be adequately protected and cared for.\4\

                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Mike Crapo

            On Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Price-Setting 
                    Program Implementation Guidance

  definition of ``qualifying single-source drug'' for program purposes
    Question. The definition of ``qualifying single-source drug'' 
included in CMS's initial guidance for the implementation of the IRA's 
price-setting program risks dramatically expanding the size and scope 
of new Federal initiative. Finalized under section 30 of the guidance 
document, CMS has adopted a seemingly anomalous approach, departing 
from standard statutory and regulatory definitions of ``drug'' and 
``biologic'' to treat virtually all medications with the same active 
ingredient or moiety and the same manufacturer as a single product, 
regardless of clinically meaningful differences.

    Based on this definition, new indications, formulations, strengths, 
or other differences would prove insufficient to distinguish between 
two medications with a shared active ingredient, even if approved or 
licensed pursuant to a distinct New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics 
License Application (BLA). The price-setting program would capture all 
forms of any medicines with the same active ingredient, with 
eligibility for selection and price-setting determined based on the 
first approval or licensure date for a product that includes the active 
moiety (and with the same manufacturer), even if years or decades of 
high-cost, high-risk, and time-intensive research and development 
programs separated two different drugs or biologics.

    What is the statutory basis for treating drugs or biologics with 
the same active ingredient/moiety but with approvals or licensure 
granted pursuant to separate NDAs or BLAs as the same product for 
eligibility and selection purposes? Where else in statute or in 
regulation does a Federal agency aggregate multiple different 
medications in this way?

    This definition seems likely to discourage research and development 
into new indications, formulations, dosage forms, and strengths for any 
given compound, since even the most clinically meaningful enhancements 
or novel uses would afford manufacturers no avenue out of the price-
setting program. Particularly for active ingredients with earlier 
initial applications, the law's declining statutory price ceilings 
could make any potential financial returns from new indications, 
patient populations, or improvements unfeasible. Has CMS conducted an 
impact analysis of the effect of this definition on R&D into new 
indications, formulations, or other developments with respect to 
existing compounds?

    Will CMS consider providing an opportunity for public comment with 
respect to section 30 of the guidance document, given the far-reaching 
implications of this definition and of other policies included in the 
section?

    Answer. The initial guidance details the requirements and 
parameters of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, including 
requests for public comment on key elements of the program, and 
announces the next steps for how the agency will implement the new 
program for 2026, which is the first year in which the first set of 
negotiated prices will apply. In the initial guidance, CMS describes 
the definition we will use to identify a qualifying single source drug 
for purposes of selection and negotiation for initial price 
applicability year 2026. This approach to identifying a qualifying 
single source drug aligns with the requirement in the law to use data 
aggregated across dosage forms and strengths of the drug, including new 
formulations of the drug.

    As always, CMS broadly welcomes input from the public at all times. 
In the initial guidance for the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation 
Program, CMS is voluntarily soliciting comment on a number of key 
topics related to implementation of the new program. Due to timing 
constraints and the requirement to publish the selected drug list for 
initial price applicability year 2026 by September 1, 2023, CMS is 
issuing guidance on topics related to drug selection as final, without 
a comment solicitation.

    Comments received by April 14, 2023, will be considered for revised 
guidance. CMS anticipates issuing revised guidance for the first year 
of negotiation in Summer 2023. CMS is striving for an effective 
negotiation process with manufacturers that lowers prescription drug 
prices and ensures people with Medicare have access to innovative 
therapies, while meeting the ambitious timeframes specified under the 
law.
                 implications for rare disease patients
    Question. While the IRA excludes orphan drugs indicated for just 
one rare disease or condition from selection for the price-setting 
program, the narrowness of this exemption risks discouraging drug 
developers from undertaking the high-cost and high-risk research and 
development needed to identify new potential uses for products that 
meet this definition, since even a new indication for a second rare 
disease would render an orphan drug ineligible for the law's exemption.

    Will you commit to working with Congress to remedy this exemption 
by ensuring that it applies to orphan drugs with indications for 
multiple different rare diseases, recognizing that the current 
exclusion structure disincentivizes R&D into additional indications?

    The guidance notes that CMS ``is considering whether there are 
additional actions CMS can take in its implementation of the 
Negotiation Program to best support orphan drug development.'' What 
types of actions on this front is the agency considering, and how can 
Congress support these efforts?

    Answer. CMS supports continued drug innovation and believes it is 
vitally important that beneficiaries have access to innovative new 
therapies. We are striving to implement the Negotiation Program in a 
thoughtful way that both improves drug affordability and accessibility 
for people with Medicare and supports innovation.

    The law requires CMS to exclude certain orphan drugs when 
identifying qualifying single source drugs, referred to as the orphan 
drug exclusion. To be considered for the orphan drug exclusion, the 
drug or biological product must (1) be designated as a drug for only 
one rare disease or condition by the FDA and (2) be approved by the FDA 
only for one or more indications within such designated rare disease or 
condition. As noted in the initial guidance, we are still considering 
whether there are additional actions CMS can take in its implementation 
of the Negotiation Program to best support orphan drug development. The 
agency will continue to keep Congress and stakeholders updated as we 
move forward.
                       the price-setting process
    Question. The initial guidance affords affected manufacturers up to 
three in-
person or virtual meetings over the course of the price-setting 
process, which could help to facilitate and clarify the exchange of 
offers and information under the program. By stipulating that the first 
meeting will not occur until after the manufacturer has submitted a 
counteroffer, however, the guidance document constrains early 
opportunities for engagement between the agency and manufacturers. 
Along the same lines, by artificially capping the number of meetings at 
three, the guidance document fails to provide sufficient flexibility 
and adaptability for agency officials and manufacturers.

    Will CMS consider allowing for more than three in-person or virtual 
meetings in the course of the negotiation process, given that 
additional engagement opportunities might inform price offers and 
counteroffers, in addition to clarifying potential misconceptions and 
answering outstanding questions?

    To that end, will CMS consider allowing for in-person or virtual 
meetings earlier in the negotiation process (i.e., prior to the 
counteroffer stage, and ideally prior to the initial offer issuance), 
since such conversations could better inform and clarify considerations 
related to the agency's initial offer determination, as well as the 
manufacturer's counteroffer determination?

    Answer. The law requires the Secretary to negotiate directly with 
manufacturers, in an offer/counteroffer process, in order to arrive at 
a maximum fair price. For initial price applicability year 2026, the 
law requires that by February 1, 2024, CMS must provide the 
manufacturer of a selected drug with a written initial offer and if the 
manufacturer provides a counteroffer to the initial offer, such 
counteroffer must be in writing. As described in the initial guidance 
for 2026, if CMS's written response to the counteroffer rejects the 
manufacturer's written counteroffer, CMS will extend an invitation to 
the manufacturer for a negotiation meeting. After this initial meeting, 
CMS intends to give each party (CMS and the manufacturer) the 
opportunity to request one additional meeting, resulting in a maximum 
of three meetings between CMS and the manufacturer.\5\

    \5\ Pulled from Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program Initial 
Guidance (pp. 55-56), https://www.cms.gov/files/document/medicare-drug-
price-negotiation-program-initial-guidance.pdf.

    CMS believes that the negotiation meeting process described in the 
initial guidance for 2026 allows for a more efficient and effective 
approach than preparing and exchanging additional written offers and 
counteroffers. Negotiation meetings would also allow both parties to 
discuss any new information that may have become available about the 
selected drug or its therapeutic alternatives, consistent with the 
negotiation factors described in the statute, that may affect the 
determination of the maximum fair price. CMS believes that an offer/
counteroffer process that includes in-person or virtual meetings would 
most effectively facilitate the negotiation process to arrive at a 
maximum fair price and is more consistent with current industry 
practices for drug price negotiation. In the initial guidance for 2026, 
CMS solicited comments on this proposed drug price negotiation process, 
and specifically requested comment on the advantages and disadvantages 
of this negotiation process, as well as whether there are alternatives 
that CMS should consider. Comments received by April 14, 2023, will be 
considered for revised guidance. CMS anticipates issuing revised 
guidance for the first year of negotiation in Summer 2023.\6\

    \6\ Pulled from Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program Initial 
Guidance (pp. 55-56), https://www.cms.gov/files/document/medicare-drug-
price-negotiation-program-initial-guidance.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    negotiation versus price-setting
    Question. While the IRA characterizes the new price-setting program 
as ``negotiation,'' manufacturers appear to have no meaningful choice 
except to accept the final offer dictated by the Secretary, regardless 
of how unrealistically low it might be. Rejecting the offer would 
require a drugmaker either to incur an impossibly steep penalty of up 
to 95 percent of all gross sales for a selected drug, or else to pull 
all drugs from Medicare and Medicaid entirely, an unrealistic 
proposition for the vast majority of manufacturers, and one with 
significant access risks for patients. This dynamic minimizes 
manufacturers' leverage, as the law and guidance document offer them no 
apparent recourse for an unfairly and arbitrarily low price-point.

    Does CMS plan to provide manufacturers with access to any dispute 
resolution processes or mechanisms over the course of the price-setting 
process?

    What steps can the manufacturer of a selected drug take if CMS 
presents a final offer with an unfairly and arbitrarily sub-market 
price? What recourse do the law and associated guidance documents 
provide, apart from two practical impossibilities (incurring the 95 
percent penalty or pulling all drugs from major Federal programs)?

    Answer. The initial guidance details the requirements and 
parameters of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, including 
requests for public comment on key elements of the program, for initial 
price applicability year 2026. Among the key elements that CMS is 
soliciting comments on is a dispute resolution process for specific 
issues that are not exempt from administrative and judicial review 
under the law.

    The law requires the Secretary to negotiate directly with 
manufacturers, in an offer/counteroffer process, in order to arrive at 
a maximum fair price and consider specific factors in the negotiation 
process. The government will not set these prices unilaterally. CMS is 
committed to following the bilateral negotiation process specified by 
the law.

    As described in the initial guidance for 2026, in developing the 
initial offer, CMS intends to focus on the clinical benefit that the 
drug provides to people with Medicare as well as whether the drug 
addresses an unmet medical need and its impact on specific populations 
compared to its therapeutic alternatives. To formulate an initial 
offer, CMS intends to: (1) identify therapeutic alternative(s), if any, 
for the selected drug; (2) use the Part D net price for the therapeutic 
alternative(s) that are Part D drugs and/or the Part B average sales 
price for the therapeutic alternatives that are Part B drugs to 
determine a starting point in developing an initial offer; (3) evaluate 
the clinical benefit of the selected drug (including compared to its 
therapeutic alternative(s)), including whether the selected drug meets 
an unmet medical need and the selected drug's impact on specific 
populations; and (4) further adjust the preliminary price by the 
manufacturer-specific factors outlined in the law to determine the 
initial offer price. CMS will not make or accept any offers for the 
maximum fair price that are above the statutorily defined ceiling price 
in the law.

    In cases where the selected drug has no therapeutic alternative, or 
if the price of the therapeutic alternatives identified is above the 
statutory ceiling for the maximum fair price, CMS intends to determine 
the starting price for the initial offer based on the Federal Supply 
Schedule (FFS) or ``Big Four'' price.\7\ If the FSS and Big Four prices 
are above the statutory ceiling, then CMS intends to use the statutory 
ceiling as the starting point for the initial offer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ The Big Four price is the maximum price that any ``Big Four 
Agency'' (the Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA), Department of 
Defense (DoD), the Public Health Service, and the Coast Guard) is 
required to pay. See: https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57007.

    CMS will be considering the negotiation factors outlined in the law 
very seriously. CMS is striving to implement the Negotiation Program in 
a thoughtful way that both improves drug affordability and 
accessibility for people with Medicare and supports innovation.
                 deterring public private partnerships
    Question. The guidance document for the price-setting program 
specifies that the receipt of Federal financial support at any stage of 
drug discovery or development will trigger a downward adjustment in the 
Secretary-mandated price ceiling for a given product. This provision, 
if finalized, could discourage manufacturers from partnering with the 
Federal Government, thus undermining the core framework for innovation 
established under the Bayh-Dole Act.

    Will CMS commit to reconsidering its interpretation of the Federal 
financial support factor, given the risk of deterring the types of 
public-private partnerships that have driven some of our greatest 
medical advances?

    Answer. The Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program is unrelated 
and stands separate and apart from march-in authority. CMS is committed 
to following the bilateral negotiation process specified by the law 
with manufacturers of the drugs selected for negotiation.

    The statute requires that CMS consider certain factors for 
negotiating the maximum fair price, including certain information 
provided to CMS by manufacturers, that is specific to the drug that is 
subject to negotiation. Prior Federal financial support for novel 
therapeutic discovery and development received by the manufacturer for 
the drug is one of the factors identified in the law that CMS is 
required to consider in the negotiation. We are implementing the 
Negotiation Program in accordance with the law. The initial guidance 
describes the consistent process CMS is proposing to use when 
considering all these factors when negotiating a maximum fair price 
with the manufacturer for a selected drug.

    Question. On a related note, will HHS commit to continuing its 
longstanding policy of rejecting Bayh-Dole ``march-in'' petitions that 
rely primarily on pricing dynamics, given that Senators Bayh and Dole 
repeatedly reaffirmed that their law's march-in rights did not 
authorize the imposition of de facto price controls?

    Answer. The Bayh-Dole Act was designed to promote the 
commercialization of research results, maximize the potential for 
federally funded technologies to become products, and serve the broader 
interest of the American public. HHS is committed to implementing the 
law and upholding these aims to support the innovation needed to 
deliver new and effective drugs to patients. To that end, HHS has 
partnered with the Department of Commerce to review the use of march-in 
authority as laid out in the Bayh-Dole Act. Through this partnership, 
we have asked an Interagency Working Group to develop a framework for 
consistent implementation of the march-in provision across the U.S. 
Government that clearly articulates guiding criteria and processes for 
making determinations where different factors, including price, may be 
a consideration in agencies' assessments. HHS will convene a workshop 
in 2023 to further refine the cases for which HHS could consider 
exercising march-in authority. HHS will seek input from a diverse array 
of interested parties--including patient groups, industry, 
universities, small business firms, and nonprofit organizations, as 
well as experts in technology transfer and innovation policy. The goal 
of the workshop will be to assess when the use of march-in rights is 
consistent with the policy and objectives of the Bayh-Dole Act.
                            comment periods
    Question. CMS's decision to offer opportunities for public comment 
with respect to the guidance documents governing key programs under the 
IRA will hopefully help to inform implementation efforts and minimize 
operational concerns. However, given the complexity of the documents 
and policies in question, along with the considerable unanswered 
questions that remain outstanding, the 30-day comment periods provided 
thus far have proven challenging, as policymakers and stakeholders have 
attempted to review, consider, and engage on a wide range of policy 
matters in a short time.

    Will CMS consider providing lengthier comment periods for some 
components of IRA program implementation?

    Answer. The Inflation Reduction Act directs CMS to implement the 
Negotiation Program for 2026, 2027, and 2028 by program instruction or 
other forms of program guidance. CMS must meet deadlines set forth in 
statute. Of critical importance, the law requires that CMS publish the 
selected drug list for initial price applicability year 2026 by 
September 1, 2023. CMS recognizes that public input will help to 
achieve successful implementation, and so CMS is electing to 
voluntarily take comments on certain topics in this initial negotiation 
guidance. In order to release initial guidance, voluntarily take 
comments, and issue revised guidance as soon as practicable, CMS must 
work on an expedited timeline, which necessitates a 30-day comment 
period.

    In order to facilitate the timely implementation of the Negotiation 
Program, CMS is issuing guidance on identification of selected drugs as 
final, without a comment solicitation (with the exception of the Small 
Biotech Exception Information Collection Request (ICR), for which 
comments should be made in response to the ICR).

    In the revised guidance, CMS may make changes to any policies, 
including policies on which CMS has not expressly solicited comment, 
based on the agency's further consideration of the relevant issues.

    CMS is committed to collaborating and engaging with the public in 
the policymaking process. CMS is working closely with patients and 
consumers, Part D plan sponsors and Medicare Advantage organizations, 
drug manufacturers, hospitals and health-care providers, wholesalers, 
pharmacies, and others. CMS is engaging and will continue to engage 
interested parties through national stakeholder calls, quarterly 
strategic meetings, and monthly technical calls with CMS staff. In

              proposed ira price-setting program expansion
    Question. The President's Budget proposes expanding the 
prescription drug price-setting program enacted under the IRA to 
capture more medications each year and to subject drugs to the 
selection and price-setting process sooner after their launch. While 
the proposal provides no details beyond these broad concepts, reporting 
from Bloomberg Law \8\ cited data from the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) indicating that under the proposed expansion, 
drugs and biologics could be subjected to the so-called negotiation 
process as early as 5 years after FDA approval or licensure, and that 
the budget proposal would double the number of medications selected for 
the program each year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/biden-
puts-drug-pricing-at-center-of-medicare-spending-debate.

    This framework, if adopted, would inevitably slash biomedical 
research and development, resulting in fewer new drug discoveries and 
approvals in the coming years. Moreover, the proposed expansion would 
further erode American intellectual property (IP) protections by 
substantially weakening potential economic returns for new drugs, which 
currently tend to benefit from roughly 13 to 14 years of patent 
protection after FDA approval. With just 5 years of insulation from 
government-imposed price controls, which the Secretary can set with no 
floor and no opportunity for judicial or administrative review, drugs 
and biologics alike would lose crucial incentives for the investments 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
that drive their research and development today.

    What is the Biden administration's rationale for subjecting drugs 
and biologics to the price-setting program after just 5 years?

    How does the administration anticipate that the proposed expansion, 
if codified, would affect private investment in biomedical research and 
development (R&D), as well as in the number of drugs and biologics that 
come to market each year?

    Have CMS's Office of the Actuary (OACT) or the Congressional Budget 
Office (CBO) conducted a budgetary analysis of the proposed price-
setting program expansion?

    When does HHS plan to provide more detailed parameters and 
specifications of the proposed program expansion to Congress?

    Answer. The budget proposal builds on the Inflation Reduction Act 
by increasing the number of drugs subject to negotiation and making 
drugs eligible for negotiation sooner after their launch. Expanding the 
Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program accelerates the increased gains 
in access for Medicare beneficiaries to innovative, life-saving 
treatments enacted by the law, with lower costs for people with 
Medicare and the program.\9\

                    the ira's small-molecule penalty
    Question. Under the IRA, small-molecule drugs receive just 9 years 
of protection from Secretary-dictated price controls. Given that 
roughly half of the return on investment for these products tends to 
come between year 9 and year 13 on the market, the price-setting 
program thus imposes a de facto penalty on small-molecule medications.

    Surveys of manufacturers suggest that many drugmakers plan to steer 
R&D investments away from small-molecule products in light of this de 
facto small-
molecule penalty. The consequences of forgone innovation in small-
molecule development could prove particularly dire for mental health 
conditions, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. While even providing for 
parity between small molecules and biologics under the terms of the 
price-setting program by extending the small-molecule exemption period 
from 9 years to 13 would still deter longer-term product enhancements 
and new indications, alignment would at least mitigate the small-
molecule IP erosion imposed by exposing these products to price 
controls roughly 3 to 4 years (on average) before their patent 
protections would otherwise end.

    Is HHS open to working with Congress to mitigate the aforementioned 
small-
molecule penalty by extending the price-setting program exemption 
period for these products to more closely align with the exemption 
period for biologics?

    To what extent is HHS tracking private-sector R&D investments in 
small-
molecule and biologic medication candidates in order to monitor 
potential effects of the IRA's price-setting program?

    Answer. The law requires that at least 7 years, for drugs, or 11 
years, for biologicals, must have elapsed between the selected drug 
publication date and the FDA approval or licensure, as applicable. We 
are implementing the Negotiation Program in accordance with the law.

    CMS has been regularly engaging with members of the public to get 
their feedback so that we are implementing the Negotiation Program in a 
thoughtful way that both improves drug affordability and accessibility 
for people with Medicare and supports innovation. We plan to get public 
input throughout the implementation of the Negotiation Program to make 
sure that we know what is occurring in the market.
         ira drug price-setting program implementation funding
    Question. CMS has not yet issued a response to a February 22nd

    Given the importance of accountability and good governance, will 
CMS provide responses to the questions detailed in the February 22nd 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
letter on a timely basis?

    How does CMS plan to ensure meaningful transparency and engagement 
with Congress on its plans and operational considerations for using the 
funding appropriated for implementation of the price-setting program?

    Answer. CMS is prioritizing transparency and outreach, actively 
encouraging input and insight from interested parties. We believe that 
public feedback is an important part of the implementation process, and 
we welcome it.

    To that end, on January 11, 2023, CMS published a memo detailing 
its approach to implementing the Negotiation Program, including plans 
for public engagement through stakeholder calls, quarterly strategic 
meetings, and monthly technical calls with CMS staff; plans for program 
guidance; a strategy for data collection, including public comment 
periods; and upcoming key dates and an estimated timeline for 
implementation. Release of this initial memo set the stage for multiple 
comment opportunities for members of the public, people with Medicare 
and their families, beneficiary and consumer advocates, pharmaceutical 
manufacturers, health-care providers, and other interested parties.

    On March 15, 2023, CMS issued initial guidance detailing how CMS 
intends to implement the Negotiation Program for 2026. Among other 
items, the initial guidance details how CMS intends to identify 
selected drugs, consider factors in negotiation, conduct the 
negotiation process, and establish requirements for manufacturers of 
selected drugs. Consistent with our commitment to transparency 
throughout implementation of the Negotiation Program, we are seeking 
public comment from all interested parties on certain key elements of 
the guidance through April 14, 2023. After considering the comments, 
CMS anticipates issuing revised guidance for the first year of the 
Negotiation Program in Summer 2023.

    CMS has kept your staff updated on implementation progress, 
including through emails and briefings related to agency actions. We 
received the letter referenced in your question and will provide a 
response. We will also continue to keep your staff updated as we move 
forward.
                   drug shortages and price controls
    Question. Escalating drug shortages pose a major threat to American 
patients. According to a recent report from the Senate Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC), the number of 
active drug shortages reached a recent peak of 295 at the end of last 
year,\11\ just months after the IRA's inflation-based price controls 
for Medicare Part D medications first went into effect. For a range of 
medical conditions, from behavioral health challenges to cancer, these 
shortages can result in life-threatening consequences.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Drug-
Shortages-HSGAC-Majority-Staff-Report-2023-03-22.pdf.

    Experts and government officials from across the political spectrum 
have long recognized the role that pricing dynamics can play in product 
shortages, including with respect to prescription drugs. The current 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner, for instance, recently 
cited weak price incentives as a driver of medication shortages,\12\ in 
keeping with the findings from a 2019 FDA report, which concluded that 
``[d]rug shortages persist because they do not appear to resolve 
according to the `textbook' pattern of market response,'' whereby 
``prices rise after a supply disruption and provide an incentive for 
existing and new suppliers to increase production until there is enough 
supply of a product to meet demand.''\13\ While pricing considerations 
fall outside of the FDA's purview, other HHS sub-agencies have tools 
and authorities that could help to mitigate medicine shortages and thus 
save American lives.

    Unfortunately, the price controls codified under the IRA, including 
both the government price-setting program and the inflation-based price 
growth penalties for Part B and D drugs, risk exacerbating the 
shortages that continue to plague our health-care system. A number of 
studies and reports have linked price control policies to product 
shortages,\14\<SUP>,</SUP> \15\<SUP>,</SUP> \16\<SUP>,</SUP> \17\ as 
noted by Ranking Member Rand Paul during a recent HSGAC hearing.\18\ In 
the context of prescription drug manufacturing, price controls dull 
incentives for market entry and hamper drugmakers' ability to adopt 
conventional and effective market responses to the types of demand 
fluctuations and supply chain disruptions that trigger medication 
shortages.

and-national-security-risks-underlying-causes-and-needed-reforms/.

    The initial guidance documents recently released by CMS regarding 
the Part B and D inflation cap policies suggest that the agency plans 
to deploy an unduly narrow and potentially counterproductive approach 
to the penalty waiver and reduction policies included in the IRA to 
account for shortages and supply chain disruptions. Rather than allow 
for full penalty waivers for medicines in shortage or in the midst of 
significant supply chain disruptions, which would help to address the 
shortage risks posed by the inflation rebate policies, CMS's initial 
guidance materials propose only partial reductions, including one 
option that would increase penalties over time for drugs remaining in 
shortage, thus presumably exacerbating, rather than mitigating, the 
type of strain that often triggers shortages in the first place. In the 
context of shortages, the market needs flexibility to respond and 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
adapt, not onerous penalties and rigid pricing requirements.

    Furthermore, while CMS's guidance documents raise concerns around 
the potential for manufacturers, in the face of full penalty waivers, 
to ``game'' the system by prolonging drug shortages, this worry 
disregards basic economics. Drugmakers confront major financial, 
reputational, and regulatory incentives to minimize and address 
shortages, insofar as they have the tools available to do so. In 
finalizing its guidance documents, CMS should maximize these tools by 
ensuring full penalty waivers for drug shortages and severe supply 
chain disruptions, in keeping with the apparent intent of the relevant 
IRA provisions.

    Will CMS commit, in finalizing its guidance for the Part B and D 
inflation rebate policies, to mitigating drug shortage risks by 
enabling full penalty waivers for medications in shortage and products 
facing severe supply chain disruptions?

    Answer. The law requires CMS to reduce or waive the rebate amount 
for certain rebatable drugs, such as those ``currently'' on the FDA 
drug shortage list, a Part B or Part D rebatable drug that is a 
biosimilar biological product and experiencing a severe supply chain 
disruption, or a Part D rebatable drug that is a generic and 
experiencing a severe supply chain disruption or if the Secretary 
determines it is likely to be described as in shortage in the next 
applicable period without a reduction or waiver.

    CMS has requested comment on specific scenarios CMS should consider 
for purposes of reducing or waiving the rebate in the case of a 
shortage or severe supply chain disruptions, and approaches CMS could 
use to reduce or waive the rebate amount. CMS intends to structure this 
policy such that it does not create incentives for manufacturers to 
intentionally maintain their drug or biological in shortage.

    Question. What other steps do HHS and its sub-agencies plan to take 
to address the rash of drug shortages currently imperiling patients' 
access to care?

    Answer. Ensuring and increasing the availability of safe and 
effective medicines are key priorities for FDA. We recognize that not 
having access to necessary drug products is a serious concern. FDA 
helps prevent and resolve shortages in various ways, such as through 
expediting its reviews of new production lines or material sources to 
increase production, reviewing requests for extensions of product 
expiration dating, helping manufacturers identify root causes of 
shortages, and exercising temporary regulatory flexibility for new 
sources of medically necessary drugs. In addition to working directly 
with manufacturers, FDA is closely collaborating with Federal 
Government partners to respond to surges in demand. As a part of the 
President's Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 budget request, the agency has also 
requested additional authorities to ensure greater insight and 
transparency into the supply chain, including requirements for 
manufacturers to both notify FDA when they will be unable to meet an 
increase in demand and to enhance their reporting to the agency on drug 
manufacturing amounts. We look forward to working with Congress on 
these proposals.
                       drug price-setting program
    Question. Under the IRA's drug price-setting program, the ceiling 
for Secretary-dictated prices will decline over time, rendering 
medications affected by the program less and less profitable as they 
move from one statutory category to the next, regardless of any product 
improvements or new indications (which the law thus discourages), and 
irrespective of patent protections and exclusivities (which the law 
thus weakens). Moreover, given that the IRA includes no floor for the 
prices imposed under the program, manufacturers could feasibly face 
``penny-pricing'' for older drugs, as drugmakers sometimes currently 
confront under the 340B Drug Discount Program.

    Given the declining window for profitability under the price-
setting program, some manufacturers may opt to discontinue certain 
drugs in the face of unsustainably low government price limits. 
Meanwhile, these same sub-market maximum fair price (MFP) ceilings will 
likely deter prospective generic or biosimilar market entrants, given 
the lack of opportunity for a reasonable return on investment. These 
dynamics could easily trigger medication shortages by gutting 
incentives for both the originator drug and potential generic or 
biosimilar competitors to stay on the market.

    In developing initial guidance for the drug price-setting program, 
has CMS considered and/or addressed the risk of triggering or 
exacerbating shortages for selected products?

    What strategies or tools does the agency plan to employ in order to 
address or mitigate the shortage risks posed by the implementation of 
this program?

    How, more broadly, do HHS and CMS anticipate that the drug price-
setting program will impact the prospective generic and biosimilar 
markets for selected products? Have the agencies quantified this 
impact, and if not, do they plan to do so?

    Answer. CMS supports innovation and believe it is vitally important 
that beneficiaries have access to innovative new therapies. The law 
requires the Secretary to negotiate directly with manufacturers, in an 
offer/counteroffer process, in order to arrive at a maximum fair price 
and consider specific factors in the negotiation process. CMS has been 
regularly engaging with members of the public to get their feedback so 
that we are implementing the Negotiation Program in a thoughtful way 
that both improves drug affordability and accessibility for people with 
Medicare and supports innovation. We plan to get public input 
throughout the implementation of the Negotiation Program to make sure 
that we know what is occurring in the market.
 extending the inflation-based price controls to the commercial market
    Question. The budget proposes extending the IRA's inflation-based 
price controls to the commercial market, resulting in a sweeping new 
private-sector mandate, even as the core policies enacted last year 
have triggered higher launch prices and other market distortions.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \19\ https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-reduction-drug-prices-
11673628922.

    Apart from the catastrophic price controls of the 1970s, which 
virtually all experts and policymakers now see as a disastrous unforced 
error,\20\ can you point to a precedent for the type of far-reaching 
price controls that the administration has proposed here?

controls-stagflation-gas-shortages-biden-democrats-reconciliation-bill-
federal-reserve-11628885071.

    Answer. The Inflation Reduction Act requires manufacturers to pay 
rebates to Medicare when drug prices for certain rebatable Medicare 
Part B or Part D drugs rise at a rate that is faster than the rate of 
inflation. The budget includes a proposal to revise the formula to 
calculate these rebates beyond Medicare utilization to include drug 
units used by commercial plans. Doing so would provide additional 
savings while discouraging manufacturers from raising drug prices for 
commercial coverage including employer-sponsored plans, marketplace 
plans, and other individual and group market plans.\21\

                           home oxygen access
Public Health Emergency Waivers
    Question. For many Medicare beneficiaries living with chronic 
conditions like COPD and ALS, the home respiratory therapy 
flexibilities provided by CMS in the context of the public health 
emergency (PHE) have proven pivotal to ensuring access to medically 
necessary care. As patients, providers, and policymakers prepare for 
the impending termination of the PHE, many have raised questions 
regarding the agency's transition plans, particularly for seniors who 
originally qualified for the home oxygen benefit pursuant to the 
agency's temporary policy waivers. If required by CMS to requalify for 
home respiratory therapy once the emergency period concludes, these 
patients, along with their medical providers, could face significant 
hurdles, especially in rural and underserved areas with physician 
shortages.

    In light of these substantial burdens, does CMS plan to grandfather 
initial home oxygen benefit eligibility determinations made during the 
PHE?

    What additional clarity can the agency provide with respect to the 
upcoming transition for beneficiaries who depend on home respiratory 
therapy and originally qualified for this benefit pursuant to PHE-
related waivers and flexibilities?

    Answer. CMS recognizes that it is important for stakeholders to 
understand how CMS anticipates performing medical review after the 
Public Health Emergency (PHE) has ended. During the PHE, flexibilities 
were applied to medical reviews across claim types. For certain DME 
items, this included the non-enforcement of clinical indications for 
coverage. Since clinical indications for coverage were not enforced for 
certain DME items provided during the PHE, once the PHE ends CMS plans 
to primarily focus reviews on claims with dates of service outside of 
the PHE, for which clinical indications of coverage are applicable. CMS 
may still review these DME items, as well as other items or services 
rendered during the PHE, if needed to address aberrant billing 
behaviors or potential fraud. The HHS Office of the Inspector General 
may perform reviews as well. All claims will be reviewed using the 
applicable rules in place at the time for the claim dates of service. 
As the PHE comes to an end, CMS will continue to work with stakeholders 
to ensure beneficiary access.\22\<SUP>,</SUP> \23\

                       documentation requirements
    Question. Many patients who rely on home respiratory therapy have 
also raised concerns regarding the documentation used to demonstrate 
medical necessity for these items and services, particularly in light 
of CMS's elimination of certificate of medical necessity (CMN) 
requirements in the context of the agency's final national coverage 
determination (NCD) for Home Use of Oxygen, as issued in September 
2021. Given the issues presented by exclusive reliance on physicians' 
subjective and un-standardized medical record notes to establish 
medical necessity, some patient advocates have suggested that CMS adopt 
and implement a standardized home oxygen template incorporating 
clinical data elements (CDE) to ensure a streamlined, objective, and 
consistent means of documenting medical necessity.

    Given that CMS has already developed a template along these lines, 
why has the agency opted not to move forward with implementation of a 
standardized CDE template for home oxygen therapy to this point?

    Will the agency consider adopting such a template, to be used in 
lieu of paper records, moving forward?

    Answer. CMS has designed printable clinical templates and suggested 
clinical data elements (CDEs) to assist providers and IT professionals 
with data collection and medical record documentation to support 
coverage of selected items and services. These templates and suggested 
CDEs are intended to help reduce the risk of claim denials and ensure 
that medical record documentation is more complete.\24\ Specifically, 
CMS released a clinical template and suggested CDEs for ordering home 
oxygen therapy. The template is designed to assist a clinician when 
completing an order for home oxygen therapy to meet requirements for 
Medicare eligibility and coverage. The template meets the requirements 
for both the Detailed Written Order and Written Order Prior to 
Delivery, and is available to the clinician and can be kept on file 
with the patient's medical record or can be used to develop an order 
template for use with the system containing the patient's electronic 
medical record. While completing the ``Home Oxygen Therapy Order 
Template'' does not guarantee eligibility and coverage, it does provide 
guidance in support of home oxygen therapy equipment and services 
ordered and billed to Medicare. CMS has also released clinical 
templates and suggested CDEs for documenting the face-to-face encounter 
for Medicare home oxygen therapy eligibility and coverage and for 
documenting information regarding home oxygen therapy laboratory test 
results to meet requirements for Medicare coverage for home oxygen 
therapy. The home oxygen therapy templates and suggested CDEs are 
available at: https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/

                     patient access to medications
    Question. Numerous health-care providers have raised concerns 
regarding the potential implications of a guidance document issued by 
CMS on September 20, 2021, regarding the in-office ancillary services 
exception under the Physician Self-Referral (Stark) Law. Specifically, 
many oncology and urology physician practices report having 
conventionally provided cancer patients with the flexibility, at said 
patients' election, of receiving outpatient prescription drugs (a 
designated health service, under the relevant exception) through mail-
order services facilitated by a physician practice's pharmacy (or 
physician-owned pharmacy). Some practices have also traditionally 
allowed the spouses or caregivers of patients to pick up medically 
necessary drugs on their behalf through these facilities, under the 
relevant Stark Law exception.

    Some of the language included in the September 2021 frequently 
asked questions (FAQ) document appears to reflect a substantive 
departure from the past regulatory treatment of these types of DHS 
arrangements. To that point, numerous pharmacy boards, for instance, 
distinguish ``dispensing,'' as included in the applicable regulatory 
text, from the conduit of delivery (i.e., in these cases, the use of a 
mail carrier to deliver drugs dispensed by a practice's pharmacy or 
physician-owned pharmacy). As practices prepare for the end of the PHE 
and its associated Stark flexibilities, they have expressed concerns 
over the potential use of the guidance document to prohibit the patient 
option of mail delivery of drugs from these facilities, which could 
pose serious access challenges.

    Given the access implications and the apparent shift from 
prevailing regulatory treatment, can CMS clarify whether, under current 
Stark Law interpretation, mail-order drugs would be excluded from the 
in-office ancillary exception?

    If the agency currently regards mail-order drugs as excluded from 
the exception, would CMS consider leveraging additional authorities to 
provide an exception to the Stark Law's relevant location requirement 
in order to avert potential disruptions to patient access to medically 
necessary care?

    In 2001, CMS issued a regulation enabling mobile facilities used 
exclusively by a group practice to count under the relevant Stark Law 
exception. Would the agency consider taking a similar approach here?

    Answer. CMS has not changed its policy when it comes to enforcing 
the Physician Self-Referral Law (PSL) that regulates when referrals may 
be made for certain services. Congress has specified certain exceptions 
to the PSL in statute. One exception specified by Congress is known as 
the in-office ancillary exception. This exception permits physicians to 
supply services and items, such as drugs, to beneficiaries in the 
physician office. However, the statute does not allow physicians to 
mail drugs directly to beneficiary homes without the beneficiary coming 
into the office. During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE), CMS 
issued a waiver of the terms of this exception to make sure 
beneficiaries could receive items at home. That waiver will end on May 
11th.

    CMS does not anticipate or is not aware of any access issues 
related to the end of this waiver, because beneficiaries have always 
had options in obtaining Part D drugs, including being able to get them 
directly via mail order from pharmacies. Part D plans must meet robust 
requirements aimed at ensuring beneficiaries can obtain the Part D 
drugs they need.
                 multi-cancer early detection screening
    Question. As the Biden administration has acknowledged, advances in 
screening technology and uptake will play a key role in efforts to 
combat cancer. Studies suggest that detecting cancer at an early stage 
can lead to survival rates roughly 5 to 10 times greater than for late-
stage detection.

    That said, around 70 percent of cancer deaths in the U.S. occur in 
conditions with no recommended screening options.

    Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) testing technologies have the 
potential to revolutionize the screening landscape, leveraging rigorous 
research and cutting-edge scientific developments to detect as many as 
dozens of different cancer types, often long before symptoms even 
emerge. Once developed, approved, and brought to market, these tests 
could increase the cancer survival rate, expand and enhance treatment 
options, and reduce health-care costs.

    Last Congress saw the reintroduction of Medicare Multi-Cancer Early 
Detection Screening Coverage Act, legislation that would establish a 
Medicare coverage pathway for FDA-approved MCED screening tests. More 
than 315 State, local, and national groups, ranging from patient 
advocacy organizations and labor unions to chambers of commerce and 
frontline health-care providers, endorsed the proposal, which attained 
54 cosponsors in the Senate and 257 in the House, illustrating 
sweepingly broad bipartisan support.

    Will you commit to working with the bill's sponsors in the Senate 
and House to advance this legislation, given its potentially life-
saving effects and its alignment with the President's Cancer 
Moonshot?\26\

    Answer. One year ago, President Biden reignited the Cancer Moonshot 
and set new national goals to cut the death rate from cancer by at

during the pandemic.\28\ The Department looks forward to hearing more 
from you about how we can explore options to increase access to

Moonshot, the Biden-Harris Administration Awards Nearly $11 Million to 
Address Disparities in Cancer Screening and Follow-Up Care, https://

    As a central component of the Cancer Moonshot, in 2024, the 
National Cancer Institute is launching a new research network to study 
cancer screening, including evaluating the effectiveness of new blood 
tests for the detection of one or more cancers to prevent cancer-
related deaths. This effort is in addition to other NCI supported 
research related to MCED tests.
                      medicare telehealth coverage
    Question. Without additional congressional action, the Medicare 
coverage flexibilities for telehealth services that are currently in 
effect will expire at the end of calendar year (CY) 2024, creating an 
access cliff for beneficiaries.

    Does the Biden administration support extending some or all of 
these coverage flexibilities beyond CY 2024?

    Will HHS and its sub-agencies commit to working with Congress on a 
bipartisan and bicameral basis to develop long-term Medicare coverage 
solutions that ensure access to telehealth services?

    Answer. In response to the COVID-19 public health emergency, which 
is set to expire in May 2023, flexibilities for Medicare telehealth 
services were issued through legislative and regulatory authorities to 
increase access to care for patients and providers. The Consolidated 
Appropriations Act of 2023 recently extended many of these 
flexibilities through December 31, 2024. Extended telehealth 
flexibilities include waiving geographic and site of service 
originating site restrictions so that Medicare patients can continue to 
use telehealth services from their home and allowing audio-only 
telehealth services. Additionally, the expanded list of providers 
eligible to deliver telehealth services is also extended so Medicare 
beneficiaries can continue to receive telehealth services furnished by 
physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech language 
pathologists, and audiologists, as well as receive telehealth services 
from Rural Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers 
through December 31, 2024. If you are interested in drafting 
legislation to make these waivers permanent, CMS would be happy to 
provide technical assistance.

    Additionally, recent legislative and regulatory changes made 
several telehealth flexibilities permanent. Federally Qualified Health 
Centers and Rural Health Clinics can furnish certain behavioral and 
mental health services via telecommunications technology. Medicare 
patients can continue to receive these telehealth services in their 
home as geographic restrictions on the originating site are eliminated 
for these telehealth services. Certain behavioral and mental telehealth 
services can be delivered using audio-only communication platforms, and 
rural emergency hospitals can serve as an originating site for 
telehealth services.\29\

                tcet and access to breakthrough devices
    Question. Too often, seniors lack efficient access to medical 
breakthroughs, due in part to outdated Medicare coverage policies. 
Disappointingly, in 2021, the Biden administration rescinded the 
Medicare Coverage of Innovative Technology (MCIT) final rule, which 
would have created an expedited coverage pathway for FDA-
designated breakthrough devices. This decision came in spite of robust 
bipartisan support for the MCIT regulation.\30\<SUP>,</SUP> \31\

    When does the administration plan to issue a formal proposed rule 
for transitional coverage of innovative technologies, and how will it 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
differ from the MCIT regulation that CMS rescinded in 2021?

    Answer. CMS remains committed to expanding access to health-care 
coverage and services, including new, innovative treatments when they 
are safe and appropriate. CMS rescinded the Medicare Coverage of 
Innovative Technology and Definition of ``Reasonable and Necessary'' 
(MCIT/R&N) final rule because of concerns that the provisions in the 
final rule may not have been sufficient to protect Medicare patients. 
By rescinding this rule, CMS will take action to better address those 
safety concerns in the future.

    Improving and modernizing the Medicare coverage process continues 
to be a priority, and we remain committed to providing stakeholders 
with more transparent and predictable coverage pathways. CMS is working 
as quickly as possible to advance multiple coverage process 
improvements that provide an appropriate balance of access to new 
technologies with necessary patient protections. As part of this 
effort, CMS has conducted several listening sessions to learn about 
stakeholders' most pressing challenges and to receive feedback from 
stakeholders about which coverage process improvements would be most 
valuable.

    CMS intends to explore coverage process improvements that will 
enhance access to innovative and beneficial medical devices in a way 
that will better suit the health-care needs of people with Medicare. 
This will also help to establish a process in which the Medicare 
program covers new technologies on the basis of scientifically sound 
clinical evidence, with appropriate health and safety protections in 
place for the Medicare population. HHS looks forward to working with 
you and hearing your feedback as we move forward with these efforts.
               average sales price-related clarifications
    Question. Under the multiple best prices reporting option (MBPRO), 
a manufacturer reports two different ``best prices'' (BPs): a value-
based BP and a non-value-based BP. Patient advocates, providers, and 
other stakeholders have requested clarity as to whether, for Medicare 
Part B payment purposes, the average sales price (ASP) for a product 
leveraging MBPRO should be calculated with respect to the value-based 
or non-value-based BP.

    HHS OIG has cited the lack of clarity on this front as warranting 
attention, with a recent report noting, ``Without clear guidance, 
manufacturers argue that they will need to adopt varying reasonable 
assumptions that could create distortions among reported ASPs.''\32\ 
Enabling manufacturers to report ASP based on the sales and discounts 
considered in determining the non-value-based BP, as opposed to the 
value-based BP, would create more clarity and consistency, mitigating 
disincentives currently preventing some drugmakers from availing 
themselves of MBPRO.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \32\ https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-BL-21-00330.pdf.

    Can a manufacturer who elects MBPRO calculate ASP by reference to 
the sales and discounts considered in the determination of the non-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
value-based BP? If not, why not?

    If a manufacturer may do so, can CMS commit to issuing clarifying 
guidance promptly to address this issue? If not, why not?

    Answer. CMS appreciates the OIG's work on this area and look 
forward to working collaboratively on this and other issues in the 
future. In their report, OIG recommended that CMS actively review 
current guidance related to the areas identified in this report and 
determine whether additional guidance would ensure more accurate and 
consistent ASP calculations. CMS agrees with this recommendation and 
will review the current guidance related to the areas identified in 
OIG's report and determine whether additional guidance would help to 
ensure more accurate and consistent ASP calculations. It should be 
noted that in some cases, additional guidance could be sub-regulatory, 
and in others, it may potentially require notice and comment 
rulemaking.
                        physician payment reform
    Question. In recent years, Congress has come together on a 
bipartisan basis to enact a series of Medicare physician payment 
increases, mitigating some of the challenges confronted by our front-
line providers, particularly as inflation continues to flare. While 
constructive in the short term, this ad-hoc approach creates 
uncertainty and volatility for clinicians across the country, 
especially in rural communities.

    What specific policies would the administration propose to achieve 
a sustainable path forward for physician payment reform, driving value-
based care and restoring predictability?

    Answer. The Biden-Harris administration is committed to protecting 
and strengthening Medicare so that Americans of every generation can 
count on it. Ensuring adequate payment rates for physicians and other 
health-care professionals is essential in maintaining patients' ability 
to access high-quality and affordable health care. CMS is required to 
base payments for services under the physician fee schedule on the 
relative resource costs involved in furnishing a service, and the fee 
schedule is subject to statutory budget-neutrality requirements. CMS 
does not have the legal authority to implement increases in payment 
outside of budget neutrality without additional action taken by 
Congress.
       medicaid state burden and the federal commitment to states
    Question. Last December, Congress acted on a bipartisan basis to 
allow States to begin returning their Medicaid programs to post-
pandemic normalcy. This effort is essential to protecting hardworking 
taxpayers' dollars, but it will demand States' attention and resources, 
as well as HHS's partnership and flexibility.

    Unfortunately, last September, HHS proposed a rule that would only 
complicate States' efforts to rebalance their Medicaid programs and 
budgets. The new enrollment and eligibility requirements would 
exacerbate States' administrative and fiscal burden, and risk making an 
already massive undertaking even more inefficient.

    Can you commit that HHS will not finalize this proposed rule until, 
at a minimum, States have concluded their pandemic-related 
redeterminations process?

    Answer. In September 2022, CMS issued a proposed rule \33\ that 
includes several provisions aimed at simplifying the enrollment process 
and maintaining continuity of coverage for eligible beneficiaries, 
including children and individuals dually enrolled in Medicare and 
Medicaid, many of whom are over 65 and/or have a disability. CMS 
estimates that this proposed rule would remove barriers to enrollment 
and increase the number of eligible individuals who obtain coverage and 
are continuously enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP.\34\ Recognizing that 
most States will require up to 12 months to implement the changes 
proposed in this rule, we sought public comment on making the final 
rule effective 30 days after publication with full compliance required 
12 months later. The comment period for the proposed rule closed on 
November 7, 2022. CMS is taking into consideration comments received 
for final decision making.

                        pediatric mental health
    Question. Pediatric mental health providers continue to struggle in 
their recruitment and retention efforts at a time of immense need. 
Recently, there has been increased use of FDA-cleared digital 
technologies that can deliver evidence-based mental health treatments 
for children. These treatments could be promising and innovative 
solutions for State Medicaid programs, particularly where there are few 
pediatric mental providers in a State or region.

    Does CMS have a plan to provide technical support to States that 
want to adopt coverage and payment for these digital technologies under 
existing Medicaid authorities and payment allowances?

    Question. CMS works closely with States as they examine innovative 
ways to improve their Medicaid programs and address the specific needs 
of their residents, and CMS works closely with its Federal partners, 
like FDA, to ensure access to safe and effective interventions for 
mental health conditions and substance use disorders.

    Additionally, States have a great deal of flexibility with respect 
to covering telehealth services in their Medicaid programs, including 
mental health services provided via telehealth, and States are not 
required to submit a State plan amendment (SPA) to pay for telehealth 
services if payments for services furnished via telehealth are made in 
the same manner as when the service is furnished in a face-to-face 
setting. To establish rates or payment methodologies for telehealth 
services that differ from those applicable for the same services 
furnished in a face-to-face setting, a State would need an approved 
State plan payment methodology and might need to submit a SPA.\35\ We 
look forward to continuing to work with States as they consider these 
and other innovative coverage decisions in their Medicaid programs.

            the medicare hospital insurance (hi) trust fund
    Question. Transferring general tax revenue into Medicare's hospital 
insurance trust fund in order to make the program more solvent would be 
unprecedented. Similar to the Social Security system, the HI portion of 
the Medicare program was designed to be self-supporting. The Medicare 
Part A trust fund has a dedicated revenue stream--the HI payroll tax. 
Beneficiary services are financed through that reserved income source, 
rather than relying on general tax revenues. Congress only allowed 
temporary, and time-limited, general transfers to the HI trust fund 
during the first few years of the Medicare program's implementation. 
General revenue has never been used for the purpose of expanding 
Medicare program benefits or extending HI trust fund solvency.

    The President's budget request appears to rely solely on massive 
tax hikes and budget gimmicks to delay Medicare insolvency. Mr. 
Secretary, are you concerned that transferring general tax revenue into 
the HI trust fund would undermine the self-financing structure of the 
trust fund?

    The Penn Wharton Budget Model, an organization respected by both 
sides of the aisle, estimates that almost 40 percent of the revenue 
attributed to the President's proposal comes from redirecting current-
law revenue into the HI trust fund account. Do you agree that shifting 
tax revenue into the HI trust fund would require tax increases in other 
areas, new taxes, or deficit increases in order to compensate for the 
lost revenue streams?

    Answer. Medicare is a key pillar of our health-care system and we 
are committed to strengthening the program both now and in the future. 
Thanks to our efforts, this year's Medicare Trustees Report estimated 
that the solvency of the Medicare hospital insurance (HI) trust fund 
has been extended by 3 years since last year's report. In addition, 
adoption of the proposals in the President's FY 2024 budget would 
extend Medicare solvency by at least 25 years, without cutting benefits 
or raising costs for people with Medicare. The FY 2024 budget also 
includes a targeted package of Medicare proposals totaling $8 billion 
over 10 years that supports the administration's priorities such as 
investing in mental health, strengthening nursing home oversight, and 
enhancing program benefits. We look forward to continuing to work with 
Congress to further strengthen this vital program that serves over 65 
million Americans.\36\

                     faith-based adoption agencies
    Question. Public-private partnerships between State child welfare 
agencies and faith-based organizations help to fill critical gaps in 
State foster care and adoption programs. In addition to connecting 
children with safe and loving homes, faith-based organizations provide 
support, resources and other services to vulnerable children and their 
families.

    Critical to the work of faith-based organizations is ensuring that 
they can continue to operate, without discrimination, in accordance to 
the tenants of their faith.

    How does your budget ensure that faith-based adoption agencies are 
supported in their work to serve children and families?

    Answer. Faith-based providers are an important part of the Nation's 
foster care systems, and the budget proposes to expand foster care 
prevention and other services that are provided by a range of child 
welfare organizations, including faith-based providers, while ensuring 
that all children and families involved in the child welfare system are 
able to access publicly funded services without facing discrimination. 
The work of the Children's Bureau, including funding programs and 
providing training and technical assistance supports the faith-based 
adoption agencies equally along with the publicly operated agencies. 
Examples of this support is provided by the following:

    The multifaceted national AdoptUSKids Project:

          Featured articles in newsletters and blogs such as: 
        Partnering With Faith Based Communities To Secure Families.
          Faith-Based organizations have access to and use the 
        National Photolisting site to highlight children/youth needing 
        an adoptive family and families available to meet the needs of 
        waiting children.
          Recruitment of and highlighting of families and youth with 
        lived experience from faith-based organizations are key member 
        of the project's Speakers Bureau.
          Media Interviews are conducted to highlight the need for 
        adoptive and foster families with faith-based organizations.
          Faith-based organizations can personalize the public service 
        announcements produced by this project each year for their 
        recruitment campaigns.
          The importance of faith-based communities is highlighted on 
        the AdoptUSKids website and in the national and tailored 
        service work conducted through the project's capacity building 
        efforts to include diligent recruitment efforts with all 
        States, tribes, and territories.
          Recruitment occurs on a continual basis that targets faith-
        based organizations to refer candidates for the Minority 
        Professional Leadership Development program designed to develop 
        leadership within child welfare systems.

    Several national projects funded with Adoption Opportunities funds 
have and continued to make an impact in terms of support for faith-
based agencies across the Nation. Examples include:

          National Training and Development Curriculum: This project 
        developed and continues to infuse within public and private 
        (including faith-based) agencies a state-of-the-art, 
        comprehensive training and development curriculum for foster 
        and adoptive families. This training is made free of charge to 
        all agencies and support the pre-service and ongoing 
        developmental training needs for adoptive families to ensure 
        safe and stable permanencies.
          Quality Improvement Center for Adoption/Guardianship Support 
        and Services: This project developed and tested models of post 
        adoption support that involved many faith-based agencies and 
        continues to support the efforts of post adoption support to 
        these agencies.
          Hospital-based training for adoption support among hospital 
        staff has supported many efforts with faith-based agencies.
          National Training Initiative for Adoption-Competent Mental 
        Health Services has developed web-based training that is made 
        available to all child welfare agencies across the Nation 
        including faith-based agencies.
                        aca premium tax credits
    Question. The President's budget proposes permanently authorizing 
the expanded Obamacare premium tax credits that were most recently 
extended in the Inflation Reduction Act. Earlier this month, the U.S. 
Government Accountability Office released a report finding that CMS 
does not coordinate with States to conduct risk assessments to evaluate 
the likelihood of improper eligibility determinations for the advance 
premium tax credit.

    Do you agree with these findings, and what steps are you taking to 
ensure proper oversight of the expanded and enhanced premium tax 
credits?

    Answer. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
(ACA) established Health Insurance Exchanges through which consumers 
could submit applications and enroll in health coverage. Under the law, 
States have the authority to establish their own exchange, a State-
Based Exchange (SBE), or use the Federally Facilitated Exchange (FFE). 
HHS works with all States to address the specific needs of their 
consumers while also meeting the requirements and responsibilities set 
by statute. Eligible consumers enrolling in a qualified health plan 
through the FFE or SBE may receive financial assistance in the form of 
Advance Payments of the Premium Tax Credit (APTC). HHS is committed to 
protecting taxpayer funds while reducing the burden on consumers, 
employers, and other individuals and entities involved in the FFE and 
SBEs and other insurance affordability programs.

    HHS has applied program integrity best practices to the Exchanges 
based on efforts to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse in its 
other programs. In addition, HHS has experienced program integrity 
staff that work to prevent and address instances of potential fraud. 
HHS has also made progress toward reporting APTC improper payment 
estimates by conducting a risk assessment for the APTC program, as 
required by the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 and Office of 
Management and Budget guidance. HHS also requires SBEs to conduct a 
defined set of oversight activities, and tracks and monitors how SBEs 
establish program integrity standards that comply with Exchange-related 
policy and operational requirements set forth in statute, regulations, 
and guidance.\37\

Assessing Risks in the Improper Payment Estimation Process for Advance 
Premium Tax Credits | U.S. GAO, https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-
105577.

    In November 2022 HHS for the first time included measurements of 
the improper payment rate for the APTC program for the FFE in CMS's and 
HHS's annual 2022 Agency Financial Report. CMS reported the improper 
payment rate for Benefit Year 2020 (January 1st to December 31, 2020). 
CMS found that the FFE properly paid an estimated 99.38 percent of 
total outlays in Benefit Year 2020. The improper payment rate for the 
program was 0.62 percent.\38\ HHS estimated the improper payment rate 
based on a review of a stratified random sample of applications to 
determine if the FFE properly performed the required eligibility 
determinations and paid the appropriate benefits for each sampled 
application. Most improper payments involve situations where a State or 
provider missed an administrative step. The vast majority of improper 
payments are not fraud, and improper payment estimates are not fraud 
rate estimates. The primary causes of improper payments were manual 
errors associated with determining consumer eligibility for payments 
when verification by automated processes was insufficient or not 
possible. An improper payment could arise, for example, if a consumer 
is determined eligible for payments based on submitted documentation 
that did not meet requirements.\39\ HHS continues to develop the 
improper payment measurement program for SBEs and will continue to 
provide updates on the development status of the SBE improper payment 
measurement through its annual Agency Financial Report.

         the broken coverage with evidence development paradigm
    Question. Medicare's coverage with evidence development, or CED, 
paradigm, desperately needs reform, as experts across the political 
spectrum have contended. In addition to creating access barriers for 
countless seniors through rigid trial and study requirements, which can 
also trigger massive costs, with no guarantee of a reasonable return, 
CED protocols rarely come with a realistic or transparent path to full 
coverage, even for the most promising medical devices. Underscoring 
that point, of the 27 CED decisions issued since 2005, only four have 
ultimately been retired, after a staggering average of 8 years.\40\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \40\ https://www.agingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/
Facade-of-Evidence-CED-2-13-2023.pdf.

    Moreover, the application of this pathway to drugs and biologics 
flies in the face of statute, regulation, and longstanding precedent, 
exacerbating uncertainty, especially for the small businesses that 
drive an outsize share of innovative drug development.\41\ 
Unfortunately, rather than defer to FDA's judgment on medications and 
improve the CED paradigm for devices, CMS has doubled down on its 
onerous Alzheimer's coverage decision and considered only narrow, and 
sometimes counterproductive, changes to the CED process more broadly.

    What concrete steps will your department and its sub-agencies take 
to enhance CED and to ensure that seniors can access FDA-approved 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
medicines without needless hurdles and barriers?

    Answer. Medicare's Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) is a 
paradigm whereby Medicare covers items and services on the condition 
that they are furnished in the context of approved clinical studies or 
with the collection of additional clinical data. In making coverage 
decisions involving CED, CMS decides after a formal review of the 
medical literature to cover an item or service only in the context of 
an approved clinical study or when additional clinical data are 
collected to assess the appropriateness of an item or service for use 
with a particular beneficiary. Coverage in the context of ongoing 
clinical research protocols or with additional data collection can 
expedite earlier beneficiary access to innovative technology while 
ensuring that systematic patient safeguards, including assurance that 
the technology is provided to clinically appropriate patients, are in 
place to reduce the risks inherent to new technologies, or to new 
applications of older technologies.\42\

and CMS Staff: Coverage With Evidence Development, https://www.cms.gov/
medicare-coverage-database/view/medicare-coverage-
document.aspx?MCDId=27.

    The FDA performs a vital and an important role. CMS recognizes the 
important and related--but different--roles of the respective agencies. 
The FDA determines whether to approve a new medical product based on a 
careful evaluation of the available data and a determination that the 
medical product is safe and effective for its intended use. CMS 
conducts its own independent review to determine whether an item or 
service is reasonable and necessary for use in the Medicare population 
and should be covered nationally by Medicare.
                 ensuring a robust biosimilar pipeline
    Question. Biosimilars present a pivotal opportunity for cost 
savings, both for patients and for our health-care programs. The FDA 
has approved at least 40 of these products to date, and in the past 7 
years, biosimilars have generated more than $13 billion in savings, 
with prices averaging just 50 percent of their branded competitors.

    In Medicare Part D, however, uptake has proved lower than expected, 
jeopardizing the biosimilar pipeline and driving up out-of-pocket 
spending. A recent report from HHS's Office of the Inspector General 
found that beneficiaries could have realized savings of 12 percent in a 
single year with greater biosimilar uptake. As a case in point, even 
with the first Humira biosimilar competitor on the market, and with at 
least seven more to come before the end of 2023, Part D coverage has 
been uneven and distorted, with some plans and PBMs advantaging the 
branded product--or biosimilars with a higher sticker price.

    What specific steps does the administration plan to take to promote 
uptake and access for biosimilars in Medicare Part D?

    Answer. HHS is committed to encouraging the use of biosimilar 
biological products within the Secretary's scope of authority in order 
to reduce costs to both beneficiaries and the Federal Government. In 
general, however, a provision in the Part D statute prohibits the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services from interfering with the 
private negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and plan 
sponsors, requiring a particular formulary, or instituting a price 
structure for the reimbursement of covered Part D drugs. However, CMS 
has the authority to review Part D plan formularies to ensure that drug 
plans provide access to medically necessary treatments and do not 
discriminate against any particular populations of beneficiaries. CMS 
uses this authority to review plan formularies for appropriate 
inclusion of all drug classes. HHS will continue using its authority 
where possible to seek to promote competition, support increased 
utilization of biosimilar and generic drugs, reduce the Federal 
Government's spending on drugs, and achieve greater equity in drug 
access and affordability for beneficiaries.
               rural hospital stabilization pilot program
    Question. HHS's Budget in Brief contains a single line item 
identifying $20 million for a new Rural Hospital Stabilization Pilot 
Program. The budget describes this proposed pilot program as both 
providing assistance to rural hospitals at risk of closure and 
supporting the expansion of hospital service lines that meet rural 
communities' needs.

    What are the detailed policy specifications for this new pilot 
program, as well as corresponding cost estimates for each component of 
the proposal?

    Answer. As detailed in HHS's Health Resources and Services 
Administration's Congressional Justification for the Fiscal Year 2024 
Budget proposal, the $20 million requested to establish the Rural 
Hospital Stabilization Pilot Program would enable HRSA to help 
approximately 25 rural at-risk hospitals each year to expand their 
services to create new care in the community while expanding revenue 
streams to stabilize operations and meet local needs.

    Specifically, this program would take actions such as:

          Producing market assessments of participating hospitals to 
        assess gaps in services and those clinical areas where 
        expansion would meet local need and generate additional service 
        volume to improve financial operations; and
          Helping rural hospitals identify and move into services 
        areas that are linked to broader public health needs such as 
        behavioral health, maternity care and those services that could 
        help rural hospitals reduce disparities.
                temporary assistance for needy families
    Question. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) 
program allows States to support programs that promote independence and 
economic self-sufficiency for low-income families. Unfortunately, TANF 
has made headlines in recent years due to a lack of accountability and 
rampant misuse of funds in the program.

    The President's budget proposes to include new statutory authority 
to collect more comprehensive TANF data and to develop an improper 
payment rate for the program. While this step is necessary to improve 
program integrity, more must to be done to ensure that TANF continues 
to successfully lift families out of poverty.

    What actions has the Department taken to reduce fraud in the TANF 
program?

    How does the administration plan to engage with Congress to ensure 
that weaknesses can be addressed in the TANF program?

    Answer. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is 
committed to an effective safety net system that ensures funds are 
spent to achieve their intended purpose and welcomes the opportunity to 
work with Congress to strengthen TANF. TANF is intended to serve as a 
critical support to families experiencing economic hardships, providing 
cash assistance, employment and training assistance, and related 
services to ensure families can meet basic needs, get access to 
opportunities in the job market, and remain together.

    ACF takes all allegations of fraud and misuse very seriously, as we 
understand the vital importance of safeguarding taxpayer funds. ACF is 
working on a number of areas to reduce fraud and strengthen TANF 
program integrity. The agency proposed new statutory authority, 
included in the President's FY 2024 budget, that would allow TANF to 
collect information from States needed to calculate and report an 
improper payment estimate, identify root causes of improper payments, 
and develop and monitor corrective actions. In the absence of authority 
to collect additional data, ACF is exploring the use of existing data 
sources to strengthen TANF program monitoring and oversight, and we are 
committed to working with Congress to provide programmatic insight in 
this area. Additionally, ACF is working to ensure that auditors have 
the information they need to assess if States have complied with 
program requirements for areas including allowable costs and sub-
recipient monitoring, and to identify areas where States may need 
additional supports and technical assistance to remediate any 
weaknesses in internal controls.

    The President's budget also notes that the Administration for 
Children and Families (ACF) ``plans to propose a regulation to 
strengthen TANF as a safety net, make changes to allowable uses of TANF 
funds, and reduce administrative burden.''

    The President's budget also notes that the Administration for 
Children and Families (ACF) ``plans to propose a regulation to 
strengthen TANF as a safety net, make changes to allowable uses of TANF 
funds, and reduce administrative burden.''

    Question. What details can you provide about this proposal, and 
what timeline is ACF working towards to propose the regulation?

    Answer. ACF plans to issue a proposed rule to strengthen the TANF 
program as safety net and work preparation program, make changes to 
provide additional definitions to allowable uses of TANF funds and 
reduce administrative burden. The proposed rule will create additional 
accountability for States to realign their TANF programs to support 
those who need it most, and build programs centered around what we know 
works best for families, while maintaining State flexibility and 
remaining bound by the ways Congress intended for the program to 
operate. These changes are intended to strengthen TANF to provide the 
economic and workforce supports to those families and communities with 
the greatest needs. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 
(WIOA), except in States whose Governor opted out, TANF is a required 
partner to WIOA-authorized labor/workforce programs funded by the 
Departments of Labor and Education.

    ACF is currently engaging in listening sessions to ensure a 
proposed rule is intentional, impactful, and carefully crafted. ACF 
looks forward to sharing a more concrete timeline once the listening 
sessions have concluded.
                       kinship navigator programs
    Question. Kinship navigator programs are critical to ensuring that 
kin caregivers and their families are well supported, regardless of 
their involvement in the child welfare system.

    A recent report published by the Government Accountability Office 
(GAO) noted that, as of December 2022, States have not yet accessed 
Federal matching funds for evidence-based kinship navigator programs 
due to various challenges in understanding or meeting the evidence-
based requirements for evaluating program outcomes. The GAO report 
noted that HHS officials recognize that more time and resources may be 
needed to allow for more research on kinship navigator programs to be 
completed.

    What does HHS consider to be an appropriate time frame for States 
to build evidence supporting the effectiveness of kinship navigator 
programs?

    Answer. We agree that kinship navigator programs are critical 
supports for kin caregivers and their families. We are pleased that we 
are making progress in identifying models that are able to be rated as 
promising or supported by the Prevention Services Clearinghouse, making 
them available for use by title IV-E agencies under the title IV-E 
Kinship Navigator program. As of the date of the hearing, seven kinship 
navigator programs have been reviewed by the Prevention Services 
Clearinghouse; one of these has been rated as supported and two of 
these have been rated as promising. Building evidence can be time and 
resource intensive. Evaluations can take multiple years to plan for and 
conduct and then often take additional time to ensure findings are 
disseminated. The timeline for completing evaluations is dependent on a 
variety of factors including but not limited to funding, evaluation 
design and sample, and data collection challenges. The funding provided 
by Congress through annual appropriations under title IV-B, subpart 2 
to support the development, enhancement, or evaluation of kinship 
navigator programs is providing critical resources to assist a number 
of title IV-E agencies to carry out rigorous evaluations. ACF is also 
supporting evidence-building through the Notice of Funding Opportunity 
(NOFO) issued in 2021 for Family Connection Grants: Building the 
Evidence for Kinship Navigator Programs (HHS-2021-ACF-ACYF-CF-1903). 
That NOFO estimated a 3-year grant period for evaluation. Therefore, we 
hope that additional models will be able to be reviewed and rated over 
the next several years.

                                 ______
                                 
               Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell
                          basic health program
    Question. Between 2020 and 2022, 13.5 million additional adults 
enrolled in Medicaid thanks to enhanced Federal matching subsidies and 
other COVID-19 relief provisions. The Continuous Enrollment Provision 
especially increased coverage stability for the most vulnerable 
population and reduced costs for the government by preventing the 
Medicaid ``churn.''

    However, the Continuous Enrollment Provision is set to end after 
this month. The Kaiser Foundation estimates that 5 to 14 million 
Medicaid beneficiaries could lose coverage in the following months. In 
addition, the generous Premium Tax Credit extension provided by the 
Inflation Reduction Act is set to expire after 2025, and it is not 
certain whether it will be extended again.

    We must look for a long-term solution that could both reduce costs 
for beneficiaries and the government, while ensuring that the most 
vulnerable population continues to receive affordable, quality coverage 
after the Public Health Emergency. I believe that the Basic Health 
Program is the answer to these issues.

    The Basic Health Program has produced tremendous results and 
savings for the two States, New York and Minnesota, which have adopted 
it. For example in New York, the BHP generated $1 billion in savings 
for the State in 2019. Compared to benchmark silver plans, the 1 
million New York BHP beneficiaries spent $719 million less in premium 
and out-of-pocket costs. As of 2021, all New York BHP enrollees are 
paying $0 in premiums. The program is so successful that the State is 
pursuing a waiver to increase BHP eligibility from 200 percent of the 
Federal Poverty Level to 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Level.

    At the same time, the BHP provides coverage stability by capturing 
those most susceptible to the Medicaid churn. This ensures that they 
don't have a lapse in coverage or are subject to unnecessary 
administrative procedures.

    In your budget request, you proposed to make the enhanced Premium 
Tax Credit permanent. This is projected to cost $183 billion over 10 
years. Why do you think that this is the best method to lower health 
insurance costs?

    Do you think that the Basic Health Program could be a more cost-
effective alternative to making the expensive Premium Tax Credits 
permanent?

    As States begin to conduct Medicaid eligibility redeterminations 
next month, we will need to ensure that those who no longer qualify for 
Medicaid remain insured. How are you ensuring that those who no longer 
qualify for Medicaid can continue to receive quality, affordable 
coverage?

    Do you believe that the Basic Health Program could be a good way to 
fill the gap and increase coverage stability?

    Last year, the Oregon and Kentucky State legislatures voted to 
establish their own Basic Health Programs. West Virginia could be next. 
This shows that States are exploring different options to reduce costs 
and provide quality health insurance for their residents.

    How can we incentivize more States to adopt the Basic Health 
Program?

    Will you work with me to encourage more States to adopt BHPs?

    Answer. CMS is committed to using all the levers at our disposal to 
expand access to high-quality, affordable care, and the President's FY 
2024 budget includes a number of proposals that would support this 
goal. For example, the budget proposes to permanently expand premium 
tax credit eligibility by eliminating the required contribution for 
individuals and families making 100 percent to 150 percent of the 
poverty level and limiting the maximum income contributions towards 
benchmark plans to 8.5 percent of income. Thanks to these subsidies, 
for Open Enrollment 2023, four out of five people returning to 
HealthCare.gov were able to find a plan for $10 or less after tax 
credits.

    CMS is also taking steps to make sure the country is prepared for 
the end of the public health emergency on May 11th. For 2 years, CMS 
has been working with all States to prepare for the unwinding of this 
``continuous enrollment'' condition in order to ensure that as many 
people as possible maintain health coverage. That includes helping 
eligible individuals stay in Medicaid and CHIP, and helping others 
transition to the Marketplaces, Medicare, or employer-sponsored 
coverage. CMS is assessing States' compliance with Federal Medicaid 
eligibility redetermination requirements and, where necessary, 
developing strategies to address gaps or deficiencies.

    CMS has implemented a multipronged approach to improve coverage 
transitions, including a ramped-up outreach and marketing campaign, and 
a variety of improvements to Federal marketplace policies and systems 
to streamline the consumer experience, including a new Marketplace 
Special Enrollment Period available now on HealthCare.gov for qualified 
individuals and their families who are no longer eligible for Medicaid 
or CHIP coverage.

    This approach also includes enhanced consumer engagement for 
consumers who lost or will soon lose Medicaid or CHIP coverage. 
Navigators and other assistance personnel will maintain a critical 
physical and virtual presence in communities across the U.S. to help 
consumers understand basic concepts and rights related to health 
coverage, provide enrollment assistance, and work with individuals to 
link coverage to care. Specifically, CMS made a historic investment, 
allocating a total of $100 million to Federal marketplace navigator 
grantee organizations for the 2022-2023 budget period, including $12.5 
million in support of additional direct outreach, education, and 
enrollment activities for unwinding.

    Continuing to expand access to coverage is essential, and I agree 
there is a real opportunity with the Basic Health Program. CMS works 
closely with States to identify innovative ways to expand access to 
high-quality care while reducing health-care costs. I look forward to 
continuing to work with Congress, and to hearing from any interested 
States that want to try the program for themselves.
                        title x family planning
    Question. The title X program provides essential reproductive 
services like birth control, STI screenings, and preventative cancer 
screenings. In 2021, it served about 1.7 million people, two-thirds of 
whom were living under the Federal poverty level.

    Investments in family planning are a proven way to keep people 
healthy, improve families' financial security, and save taxpayers 
money. In Washington State, there are over two dozen Planned Parenthood 
centers that rely on sustained title X funding. Without these clinics, 
thousands of people would not receive the health care they need.

    Since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to 
abortion last year, access to contraception is more vital than ever. 
Contraception cannot replace the need for abortion services, but it can 
help prevent women from having to travel hundreds of miles out of State 
for basic health care or an abortion.

    Additionally, smaller and rural medical facilities are suffering 
from post-pandemic financial strain and a lack of medical 
professionals. As a result, some of them, including the Astria 
Toppenish Hospital in my home State, have opted to close their 
maternity wards. This is why programs like title X are more critical 
than ever.

    Title X has been funded levelly for the past 8 straight years. This 
is unacceptable, especially as the program is working to rebuild from 
the Trump administration's devastating domestic gag rule. Washington 
State had to opt out of title X funding entirely due to the severity of 
the domestic gag rule.

    According to an American Journal of Public Health publication, 
title X needs $737 million per year to provide family planning services 
to uninsured, low-income women. The number of funding needs to be even 
higher to account for other populations that rely on title X services.

    Your Fiscal Year 2024 budget includes $512 million for title X. How 
do you account for the difference between $512 million and the $737 
million that researchers say is needed?

    Answer. Title X funding remains critical for providing family 
planning services that are equitable, affordable, client-centered, and 
high-quality. The ability to access trusted, unbiased information is 
even more important following the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health 
Organization decision and the shifting legal landscape which has led to 
confusion, misinformation, and disinformation. While data has not yet 
been collected on the impact of the Supreme Court's ruling, title X 
clinics have anecdotally reported experiencing an increased demand for 
family planning services and, correspondingly, a need for additional 
funding. The FY 2024 budget includes $512 million, a 79-percent 
increase of the 2023 enacted level.

    Question. I welcomed the Biden administration's decision to end the 
title X domestic gag rule in 2021. Data showed that under the domestic 
gag rule, title X went from serving 4 million patients in 2018 to 1.7 
million patients in 2021. Has the program rebounded since the domestic 
gag rule was overturned? How many patients did it serve in 2022?

    Answer. The data is not yet available to assess the change in 
services delivered and requested in 2022, but title X clinics have 
anecdotally reported experiencing an increased demand for services 
while combating the high turnover of key family planning staff. 
Additionally, the title X program is still rebuilding its network of 
clinics following the title X Final Rule and the restoration of funding 
for clinics nationwide in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022. Once the Family 
Planning Annual Report (FPAR) data is available in late summer of 2023, 
HHS will assess the impact of the 2021 Final Rule.
                   home and community-based services
    Question. Home and community-based services are extremely popular 
in Washington State and across the country. I have worked with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to increase support for home and 
community-based care. These services help millions of older adults and 
people with disabilities avoid high-cost institutional care, while 
letting them live in the comforts of a surrounding that they are 
familiar with.

    People with disabilities and older adults simply want the same 
thing we all want--to live independently and age with dignity. 
Furthermore, home and community-based care can cost as little as one-
third of the amount of nursing home care.

    One successful program to support home and community-based services 
is the Money Follows the Person program, which I have championed. This 
program allows older adults and people with disabilities to leave 
institutional care settings to live in their communities.

    In Washington State, the Money Follows the Person program has been 
incredibly successful, saving the State Medicaid program millions of 
dollars. We must support efforts to have sustained funding for this 
program so that States can effectively use these funds to expand the 
program. We also need to do more to support caregivers, who offer 
invaluable support and perform complex work. There are over 850,000 
caregivers in Washington State, and the vast majority are unpaid, 
female, and/or racial minorities.

    While I am pleased that the Money Follows the Person program is 
funded through Fiscal Year 2027 at $450 million per year, I have heard 
that States are having difficulty planning for the program's future as 
they are uncertain whether it will be reauthorized.

    Do you think the current funding level is sufficient for each State 
to operate a successful MFP program?

    Do you recommend that the program receive permanent funding so that 
States can better plan for the program in their budgets?

    Answer. The Money Follows the Person (MFP) demonstration gives 
beneficiaries more options for their care and allows them to choose to 
receive care in the community, rather than institutions. Participating 
States have demonstrated positive outcomes, including helping 
individuals in institutions return to the community, improving 
participant quality of life, and lowering the cost of care.

    The budget proposes to invest $150 billion over 10 years in 
Medicaid home and community-based services, enabling seniors and people 
with disabilities to remain in their homes, to work, and stay active in 
their communities. At the same time, the proposal promotes better 
quality jobs for home-care workers and enhances supports for family 
caregivers, many of whom are too often forced out of the workforce due 
to the demands of caring for a loved one.

    Question. Home and community-based services cannot exist without a 
robust caregiving workforce. Home care workers are often low-income, 
women, underpaid or unpaid, and overworked.

    How would the budget support caregivers?

    Do you have any plans to increase the availability of the 
caregiving workforce while providing adequate compensation for these 
workers?

    Answer. The caregiving workforce that helps older adults and people 
with disabilities live and participate in their communities is 
comprised of the paid, direct-care workforce and unpaid family 
caregivers; Within HHS, the Administration for Community Living (ACL)'s 
budget request for FY 2024 seeks to strengthen both. With respect to 
the paid direct-care workforce, HHS/ACL is currently funding the 
development of a Direct Care Workforce Center (https://acl.gov/news-
and-events/announcements/acl-launches-national-center-strengthen-
direct-care-workforce) through which State, private, and Federal 
entities involved in the recruitment, training and retention of direct-
care workers can access model policies, best practices, training 
materials, technical assistance, and learning collaboratives. Funding 
in FY 2024 will support continued operations of the Center and 
establish demonstration grants to develop partnerships across State 
aging, disability, Medicaid, and labor/workforce agencies and with 
aging, disability, labor and provider stakeholders to implement 
recruiting, retention, and training approaches to strengthen job 
quality in the 
direct-care workforce at State and local levels. The Direct Care 
Workforce Center is designed to catalyze change at a systems level that 
will address the insufficient supply of trained direct-care workers, 
including Direct Support Professionals to assist individuals with 
disabilities to become and stay employed and live in the community, 
promote promising practices at all levels of the service system, and 
improve data collection to enable a full understanding of the workforce 
issue. The anticipated outcomes of this effort, include but are not 
limited to:

          Increasing the availability and visibility of tools and 
        resources to attract, train and retain the direct-care 
        workforce in quality jobs where they earn livable wages and 
        have a voice in their working environment and have access to 
        benefits and opportunities for advancement; and
          Increasing the number of States that develop and sustain 
        collaborations across State systems and workforce agencies to 
        implement strategies that will improve the recruitment, 
        retention, and advancement of high-quality direct-care 
        workforce jobs.

    Family caregivers often rely on direct-care workers to augment 
their efforts to support and assist those for whom they provide care. 
Over 53 million people are family caregivers, with a growing number of 
people having to provide care or provide more care due to the direct-
care workforce crisis. To address the need for greater recognition, 
inclusion and support of family caregivers, in September 2022 ACL, in 
collaboration with the Family Caregiving Advisory Council, delivered to 
Congress and the Nation the first National Strategy to Support Family 
Caregivers (the Strategy) (https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/09/21/
hhs-delivers-first-national-strategy-support-family-caregivers.html).

    The strategy addresses five critical priorities areas associated 
with supporting family caregivers, one of which (Outcome 3.9) addresses 
the need for ``an agile, flexible, and well-trained direct-care 
workforce . . . to partner with and support family caregivers.'' 
Additionally, the Strategy puts forth a series of ideas for action that 
can be taken by multiple sectors to increase the availability and 
viability of the direct-care work force.

    ACL is beginning some initial steps to implement the Strategy, 
including establishing technical assistance (https://www.grants.gov/
web/grants/search-grants.
html?keywords=caregiver) to curate best practices and model policies 
and launching a project to help caregivers access services and 
supports. Funding in FY 2024 will allow ACL to provide training and 
technical assistance to the aging, tribal and kinship family caregiver 
support networks and to establish demonstration grants to enable States 
and local communities to test solutions and strategies identified in 
the Strategy to support family caregivers, including by strengthening 
the paid direct-care workforce and the partnership between that 
workforce and family caregivers.

              Questions Submitted by Hon. Robert Menendez
    Question. Please explain the increased role title X plays following 
the Dobbs decision and why it is such a critical part of supporting 
women's reproductive health?

    Answer. For over 50 years, title X family planning clinics have 
played a significant role in ensuring access to reproductive and 
preventive health-care services for millions of low-income or uninsured 
individuals. Following the Dobbs decision, expanding and maintaining 
access to contraception and family planning services under the title X 
program has become more critical than ever. The shifting legal 
landscape resulting from the Supreme Court's ruling has led to 
confusion, misinformation, and disinformation--which has increased the 
need for evidence-based and high-quality services and information. The 
title X program supports high-
quality, family planning services and preventive care, including breast 
and cervical cancer screening, contraceptive counseling and care, 
sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, and HIV 
screening. While contraception and related title X-funded services 
cannot replace the need for abortion, title X-funded clinics remain a 
critical safety net and important access point for trusted, nonbiased 
health-care services and information for many people in need of care.

    Question. Please explain why title X funding is particularly 
important to promoting health equity and racial and economic justice?

    Answer. Advancing equity for all through the delivery of health-
care services is a priority for the title X family planning program. 
The funding awarded to our vast network of providers and clinics 
directly supports clients from low-income families, clients of color, 
and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and 
adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality. Many of the 
clients served through our network rely on title X providers for their 
usual source of medical care, including a wide range of preventive 
services. Moreover, recipients provide title X clients with access to 
the same quality health care, including full medical information and 
referrals, that higher-income clients and clients with private 
insurance are able to access. And, the ability to access high-quality 
contraception is an important part of helping ensure people can make 
decisions about their own health, lives, and families. Title X funding 
has historically been a critically important resource in promoting 
health equity and racial and economic justice, and it remains a 
critical source of care for those most in need.

    Question. How is the administration ensuring that efforts to 
address mental health challenges support LGBTQ youth and youth of 
color?

    Answer. Within the Department of Health and Human Services, the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) 
advances efforts to reduce disparities in mental and/or substance use 
disorders across populations, including LGBTQI+ youth and youth of 
color.

    The Biden-Harris administration is committed to addressing mental 
health challenges impacting LGBTQI+ youth in several ways--all of which 
are grounded in advancing Executive Order 14075 (Advancing Equality for 
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Individuals). 
SAMHSA is promoting family counseling and support of LGBTQI+ youth by 
including language in relevant notices of funding opportunities, such 
as the School-Based Trauma-Informed Support Services and Mental Health 
Care for Children and Youth program, allowing grantees to provide 
trauma-informed evidence-based counseling and support services for 
LGBTQI+ children, adolescents, and their families/caregivers. In 
addition, SAMHSA began the ``press 3'' LGBTQI+ youth pilot for LGBTQI+ 
youth who contact the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline last fall. 
Currently, 18 percent of texts, 15 percent of chats and 6 percent of 
calls routed within 988 are for the LGBTQI+ youth-specialized services. 
Furthermore, SAMHSA supports the LGBTQI+ Behavioral Health Equity 
Center of Excellence, which provides behavioral health practitioners 
with vital information on supporting this population.

    To address mental health challenges for people of color, SAMHSA 
administers a number of Centers of Excellence. This includes the Asian 
American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Center of Excellence 
(AANHPI-CoE). The AANHPI-CoE is tasked with developing and 
disseminating culturally informed, evidence-based behavioral health 
information and providing technical assistance on training on issues 
related to addressing behavioral health disparities in the Asian 
American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities.

    SAMHSA also funds the Centers of Excellence for Behavioral Health 
Disparities, which establishes three Centers of Excellence to develop 
and disseminate training and technical assistance for health-care 
practitioners on issues related to addressing behavioral health 
disparities. It is expected that the recipients will implement training 
and technical assistance for practitioners to address the disparities 
in behavioral health care in three key populations: African Americans, 
LGBTQ, and the aging population. Additionally, African American 
Behavioral Health Center of Excellence is a new national Center whose 
academic home is the National Center for Primary Care, Morehouse School 
of Medicine. The goal of this Center is to help the field transform 
behavioral health services for African Americans, making them: Safer, 
More effective, More accessible, More inclusive, More welcoming, More 
engaging, and More culturally appropriate and responsive!

    In addition to these Centers of Excellence, SAMHSA aims to increase 
the diversity in the behavioral health workforce through the Minority 
Fellowship Program, which provides stipends to increase the number of 
culturally competent behavioral health professionals who teach, 
administer, conduct services research, and provide direct mental 
illness or substance use disorder treatment services for minority 
populations that are underserved.

    Further, the following SAMHSA grant programs include a focus on 
youth and young adults with co-occurring conditions and have helped 
ameliorate some of the gaps in access to care that youth with mental 
health challenges face: The Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health 
program (IECMH), Children's Mental Health Initiative (CHMI), the Mental 
Health Block Grant, the Family Support Technical Assistance Center, and 
the Statewide Family Network.

    Finally, for youth suffering from mental illness or a co-occurring 
disorder in the juvenile justice system, SAMHSA also operates a grant 
program to establish or expand programs that divert these youth from 
the criminal justice system into treatment when it is safe to do so. 
The Behavioral Health Partnership for Early Diversion of Adults and 
Youth program supports grantees who provide community-based mental 
health and substance use disorder services and other supports prior to 
arrest and booking.

    Question. The 988 suicide and crisis line currently provide live 
crisis center calling services in English and Spanish and uses Language 
Line Solutions to provide translation services in over 250 additional 
languages. But, text and chat services are currently only available in 
English. What are the agency's plans to improve language access to the 
lifeline?

    Answer. The SAMHSA-administered 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline 
plans to add Spanish chat and text services by the end of FY 2023 and 
is focused on supporting the Spanish crisis center workforce with 
trainings and webinars conducted in Spanish. SAMHSA also is working to 
launch video-phone services for individuals who are deaf or hard of 
hearing and might prefer to interact with 988 in that manner.

    The 988 Lifeline currently provides live crisis center calling 
services in English and Spanish. Further, the 988 Lifeline increased 
the number of call centers dedicated to taking Spanish calls in 2022. 
The 988 Spanish subnetwork has seen both an increase in calls along 
with improvement in response rates (45 percent answered volume increase 
over previous year). The Spanish call line improved response rates 
across States and territories from 63 percent in July to 84 percent in 
March 2023.

    The 988 Lifeline also offers crisis services interpreted into over 
240 languages and dialects through the call option to 988, increasing 
accessibility to many people wishing to use the line. Interpreting 
services are available 24/7 and the average time to be connected to an 
interpreter is only 17 seconds. The 988 interpreting service allows 
callers to comfortably connect with crisis counselors in their 
preferred language outside of English. To connect with an interpreter, 
callers can dial 988 and ask for an interpreter in English if they are 
able, or they can simply say the name of the language they need to 
prompt the crisis counselor to get an interpreter on the line. The 988 
interpreting service can also assist crisis counselors in identifying 
the needed language if the crisis counselor is unsure. Interpreters 
receive special training to provide effective interpretation over the 
telephone and follow a code of ethics that includes requirements 
related to confidentiality, accuracy, and impartiality. Interpretation 
is only available through calling 988, it is not yet available for 988 
text and chat services. SAMHSA is monitoring utilization of Language 
Line services to understand the demand for live crisis calling services 
in languages other than English and assess future workforce needs.

              Questions Submitted by Hon. Thomas R. Carper
                            addressing sdoh
    Question. The social drivers of health contribute to more than 80 
percent of an individual's health status and have a particularly 
profound impact on children. Addressing social drivers early in 
childhood could help reduce avoidable health-care costs across the life 
span and improve the health of our future generations.

    In the FY 2023 omnibus bill, report language related to Whole Child 
Health Demonstration models was included, which asked the Centers for 
Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) to provide a report within 180 days 
to congressional committees containing its plan to design a Whole Child 
Health demonstration program. Could you provide a status update on that 
report?

    Answer. HHS agrees that addressing the Social Determinants of 
Health (SDOH, which we are beginning to refer to as Social Drivers of 
Health to acknowledge that SDOH conditions can be mitigated to improve 
outcomes) is very important for the health and well-being of the Nation 
and that addressing SDOH requires engagement and coordination across 
HHS, as well as with other departments within the Federal Government.

    HHS is committed to advancing health equity, expanding coverage, 
and improving health outcomes for the millions of Americans covered by 
our programs, including the children enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP. In 
2021, CMS released a letter to State Health Officials, entitled 
``Opportunities in Medicaid and CHIP to Address Social Determinants of 
Health (SDOH)'', to describe opportunities under Medicaid and CHIP to 
better address SDOH and to support States with designing programs, 
benefits, and services that can more effectively improve population 
health, reduce disability, and lower overall health-care costs in the 
Medicaid and CHIP programs by addressing SDOH.\43\ Further, in 2023, 
CMS began to offer a new Medicaid section 1115 demonstration 
opportunity to support States in addressing health-related social needs 
(HRSN), with the goals of improving coverage, access, and health equity 
across Medicaid beneficiaries. HRSN are an individual's unmet, adverse 
social conditions that contribute to poor health and an individual's 
HRSN are a result of their community's underlying SDOH.\44\

    I look forward to hearing from you and from stakeholders across the 
health-care spectrum as we examine ways to build health equity into new 
and existing efforts.
                         mental health services
    Question. Medicaid and CHIP cover over 40 million children. 
Therefore, Medicaid and CHIP investments in access to needed mental 
health services are critical to addressing the national children's 
mental health emergency.

    What are you proposing in your budget to specifically address 
children's mental health challenges under Medicaid and CHIP?

    Answer. The budget provides historic investments in the behavioral 
health workforce, youth mental health treatment, Certified Community 
Based Behavioral Health Clinics, Community Mental Health Centers, and 
mental health research. The budget strengthens access to crisis 
services by investing in the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline to address 
100 percent of estimated contacts, scaling follow-up crisis services, 
and expanding CDC's suicide prevention program to all States, the 
District of Columbia, and 18 Tribal and territorial jurisdictions. To 
address the mental health crisis among adolescents, the budget expands 
CDC's What Works in Schools program to up to 75 of the largest local 
education agencies. The budget also accelerates mental health research 
for promising new treatments and enhanced precision and implementation 
of existing treatments.

    Within Medicaid and CHIP, the administration has taken a number of 
steps to increase access to children's mental health-care services. On 
August 18, 2022, CMS issued guidance to remind States about Medicaid's 
Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment requirements for 
most Medicaid beneficiaries under age 21, including in the provision of 
behavioral health services.\45\ The guidance also includes examples of 
ways that Medicaid and CHIP funding, alone or in tandem with funding 
from other HHS programs, can be used in the provision of high-quality 
behavioral health services to children and youth. On that same day, CMS 
released additional guidance encouraging States to work with schools to 
deliver on-site health-care services, including behavioral health 
services, to children enrolled in the Medicaid program.\46\

    \46\ https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/downloads/
sbscib081820222.pdf.

    CMS is also working with States to increase access to behavioral 
health-care services within schools. In addition to implementing new 
Medicaid school-based service initiatives made possible by the 
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, CMS updated guidance on Medicaid 
claiming for school-based administrative services and costs; 
established a technical assistance center in collaboration with the 
Department of Education to help States advance Medicaid coverage of 
school-based health services including mental health and substance use 
disorder services; and awarded $50 million in grants to States to help 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
improve Medicaid coverage of school-based services.

    CMS has taken a multifaceted approach to increase access to 
equitable behavioral health services and improve outcomes for people 
covered by Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and private health insurance, 
including efforts through the Connecting Kids to Coverage National 
Campaign. Campaign resources focused on mental health are available on 
InsureKidsNow.gov for organizations to use in their outreach, including 
short digital videos, live reads, social media messages, graphics, 
newsletter templates, and more.

    In addition, CMS has been working with States to ensure CHIP 
programs cover services to prevent, diagnose, and treat a broad range 
of behavioral health symptoms and disorders consistent with SUPPORT Act 
requirements. CMS works closely with States to implement mental health 
and substance use disorder parity requirements in CHIP and Medicaid--
critical to making sure kids with behavioral health conditions have 
access to the care they need.

    Lastly, in January 2022, CMS launched the 5-year implementation 
period of the Integrated Care for Kids Model to improve the quality of 
care for children under 21 years of age covered by Medicaid through 
prevention, early identification, and treatment of behavioral and 
physical health needs.\47\

                                 ______
                                 
             Questions Submitted by Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin
                    medically necessary dental care
    Question. In December 2022, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS) Medicare Physician Fee Schedule final rule clarified 
Medicare coverage of medically necessary dental services. I applaud the 
agency for heeding the call from me and my colleagues by taking this 
much needed action to improve the health and well-being of Medicare 
beneficiaries.

    When CMS issued the rule, it established a very specific definition 
in clarifying covered dental services: ``dental services that are 
inextricably linked to, and substantially related and integral to the 
clinical success of, a certain covered medical service.'' The agency 
also listed specific services covered under this definition, including, 
but not limited to, certain services ``prior to Medicare-covered organ 
transplant, cardiac valve replacement, or valvuloplasty procedures,'' 
and certain services ``performed as a result of and at the same time as 
the surgical removal of a tumor.''

    As CMS implements this policy, the agency identified numerous 
aspects that would require additional guidance. I would appreciate an 
update from the agency on its plans and timeline with respect to 
guidance covering the following issues.

    In the final rule, CMS stated that it may issue guidance to clarify 
that CMS Medicare Administrative Contractors ``may make claim-by-claim 
determinations, as necessary.'' Does CMS plan to issue such guidance 
and, if so, when does the agency anticipate the guidance will be 
available?

    Further, CMS stated that ``integration between the medical and 
dental professional,'' would be necessary for Medicare payment. Does 
CMS plan to issue guidance clarifying requirements with respect to 
medical and dental integration and, if so, when does the agency 
anticipate releasing the guidance?

    CMS also stated that dentists ``would need to be enrolled in 
Medicare and meet all other requirements for billing'' under the 
Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, and indicated it would ``work to 
provide additional guidance to answer enrollment, billing, compliance, 
and other administrative questions for dentists as needed.'' Does CMS 
intend to provide education and guidance to ensure dentists are aware 
of enrollment and other requirements so they can meet the needs of 
their Medicare patients? If so, when would this guidance and 
educational effort begin?

    CMS stated it will ``make updates to appropriate Medicare payment 
data files to ensure that appropriate payments can be made under the 
applicable payment system'' for covered services. Will CMS provide 
guidance to dentists on payment policies and payment mechanisms, which 
would be new for dentists who have are not enrolled in Medicare? If so, 
when would this information be made available?

    CMS acknowledged outstanding questions about multiple issues, 
including: the claims form ``dentists would use to submit claims for 
dental services''; the ``procedure code set and diagnostic codes that 
would be reflected on claims''; whether ``National Coverage 
Determinations (NCDs) will be issued to ensure consistent claim 
payment''; requirements regarding ``frequency limits, documentation 
requirements, and authorization processes''; and ``Medicare enrollment 
processes for dentists.''

    The agency cited ``the need to address and clarify certain 
operational issues,'' and stated it is working to address these issues, 
including efforts to adopt the dental claim form. CMS stated it plans 
to provide further guidance on these issues. Can you provide additional 
details on the process and timeline for issuing this guidance?

    Answer. Medicare payment for dental services is generally precluded 
by statute. However, Medicare has allowed payment for dental services 
in a limited number of circumstances, specifically when that service is 
an integral part of specific treatment of a beneficiary's primary 
medical condition. Some examples include reconstruction of the jaw 
following fracture or injury, tooth extractions done in preparation for 
radiation treatment for cancer involving the jaw, or oral exams 
preceding kidney transplantation.

    CMS's Calendar Year 2023 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule final rule 
clarified and codified certain aspects of the current Medicare payment 
policies for dental services when that service is an integral part of 
specific treatment of a beneficiary's primary medical condition and 
outlined other clinical scenarios under which Medicare payment can be 
made for dental services, such as dental exams and necessary treatments 
prior to, or contemporaneously with, organ transplants, cardiac valve 
replacements, and valvuloplasty procedures. Looking ahead to 2024, CMS 
will begin paying for dental exams and necessary treatments prior to 
the treatment for head and neck cancers starting in 2024.

    Finally, CMS finalized a process to review and consider public 
recommendations for Medicare payment for dental services in other 
clinical scenarios. Dentists, as appropriate, can continue to enroll in 
Medicare according to the current process. Dentists and other qualified 
practitioners who furnish dental services that are eligible for payment 
under Parts A and B (because they are inextricably linked to another 
Medicare-covered medical service) should continue to submit claims 
using current processes, and can consult with their Medicare 
Administrative Contractors (MACs) for specific claims submission 
questions.

    As noted in the CY 2023 Physician Fee Schedule final rule, CMS 
acknowledges the need to address and clarify certain operational 
issues, and is working to address these issues. CMS anticipates 
resolving many of the additional operational issues raised by 
commenters potentially as soon as CY 2024, including efforts to adopt 
the dental claim form and will also make updates to appropriate 
Medicare payment data files to ensure that covered dental services can 
be billed and paid based on the applicable payment system for services 
furnished. CMS continues to work with the MACs and encourages continued 
feedback from interested parties to help identify concerns or questions 
regarding submission and processing of dental claims. CMS also plans to 
provide guidance and engage in further rulemaking, as necessary, as 
operational strategies and plans are refined and implemented and will 
also monitor service utilization to identify any concerns about 
consistency of claims processing and adequacy of access across the 
country.

    CMS appreciates the feedback and engagement from members of 
Congress and stakeholders in the dental community during the CY 2023 
rulemaking process and looks forward to continuing that engagement as 
CMS implements this new policy.
                      nimhd and health disparities
    Question. On President Biden's first day in office, he signed an 
executive order directing a whole government approach to addressing 
racial equity and disparities among underserved communities. The 
President built on that through an additional executive order last 
month. I applaud his focus on this critical issue. Racial and ethnic 
minority populations experience higher rates of illness and death from 
health conditions such as cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, mental health, 
and obesity.

    That is why I have championed legislation throughout my time in 
Congress to highlight health disparities. In particular, I authored the 
provision in the Affordable Care Act that elevation of the National 
Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities to that of an 
Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Now known as the 
National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD 
does critical work to address health disparities. I thank the 
administration for prioritizing these efforts through previous 
increases in their funding.

    Can you comment on how NIMHD is coordinating health disparities 
research across NIH?

    How is the administration working to ensure eliminating health 
disparities is a focus of and funded through all Institutes within NIH 
and across HHS?

    Answer. NIH is committed to conducting and supporting scientific 
research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. 
NIMHD led an agency-wide workgroup culminating in the development and 
publication of the NIH Minority Health and Health Disparities Strategic 
Plan (2021-2025) (referred to in this response as the ``Strategic 
Plan'').\48\ The Strategic Plan, which aligns with the NIH-Wide 
Strategic Plan for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility,\49\ 
represents a commitment by all of NIH to advance knowledge in three 
core areas: (1) science of minority health and health disparities, (2) 
research-sustaining activities, such as training and capacity building, 
and (3) outreach, collaboration, and dissemination. Following the 
Strategic Plan's release, NIMHD is leading NIH Institutes, Centers, and 
Offices (ICOs) to examine progress toward meeting the goals outlined in 
the Strategic Plan. NIMHD has established an NIH-wide working group 
that will be evaluating the progress made on the Strategic Plan, 
identifying gaps to address by 2025, and laying the foundation for the 
Strategic plan for 2026 to 2030. The working group will develop metrics 
and a data collection system to track the alignment of activities 
related to minority health and health disparities with the Strategic 
Plan priorities.

strategic-plan-deia-fy23-27.pdf.

    NIMHD works with NIH ICOs to collectively invest in, integrate, and 
prioritize health disparities as a topic of interest through 
collaborative research initiatives, programs, and other activities. For 
example, the Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL) Against COVID-19 
Disparities and the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics for Underserved 
Populations (RADx-UP) are two initiatives that focus on populations 
disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Co-led by NIMHD and the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the CEAL Initiative actively 
works in communities in 21 States around the United States and its 
territories to build trusting relationships and share science-based 
information. The initiative supports community-engagement activities to 
address questions about COVID-19 vaccination, therapeutics, and 
participation in clinical trials among those disproportionately 
affected by the pandemic. Since its inception, CEAL has recruited over 
950 partners across the United States and Puerto Rico, supported over 
1,500 local events reaching more than half a million participants, 
delivered COVID-19 vaccines to around 200,000 people, and enrolled over 
600 people to participate in COVID-19-related clinical trials. The CEAL 
Network is well-positioned to address other critical health disparities 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
in the coming years.

    The RADx-UP Initiative is an NIH effort that comprises a consortium 
of 137 
community-engaged projects across the United States, its territories, 
as well as Tribal Nations to assess and expand COVID-19 testing to 
communities disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 
November 2022, the RADx-UP initiative and NIMHD published a special 
issue in the American Journal of Public Health highlighting peer-
reviewed research on interventions to promote testing for SARS-CoV-2, 
studies on social, behavioral, and ethical issues of the pandemic in 
underserved populations, and commentaries by NIH leadership on the 
significance of the initiative.\50\ The publication informs and 
prioritizes key strategies and responses for future public health 
responses among communities experiencing health disparities. RADx-UP is 
currently in its final phase of supporting research for improving 
COVID-19 testing interventions to decrease infections, 
hospitalizations, and mortality among populations experiencing health 
disparities.

36194852/.

    In FY 2021, NIMHD launched the Structural Racism and Discrimination 
initiative to understand and address the impacts of structural racism 
and discrimination on minority health and health disparities. The 
initiative funded 38 R01 observational and intervention research 
projects across 14 NIH Institutes. Research findings will provide 
important insights that can help address the underlying causes of 
structural racism, discrimination, and social determinants of health to 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
reduce health disparities.

    The NIH Common Fund launched the Community Partnerships to Advance 
Science for Society (ComPASS) program to support innovative structural 
intervention projects that focus on social determinants of health for 
community-empowered research. The program will enable communities and 
researchers to work collaboratively as equal partners in all phases of 
the research process to enhance the quality of interventions and 
advance health disparities research.

    The ComPASS program intends to improve health outcomes in 
communities affected by health disparities and inform social policies, 
systems, and practices to achieve optimal health for all. NIMHD, the 
National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), the National Institute 
of Mental Health, and the NIH Office of Research on Women's Health, 
serve as co-chairs of the ComPASS working group that directs major 
ComPASS activities and funding actions.

    In efforts to better understand the impact of structural racism and 
discrimination in causing and sustaining health disparities, NIMHD, 
NINR, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Diseases, and the NIH Office of Disease Prevention released a funding 
opportunity for community-engaged intervention research to address 
structural racism to reduce health disparities among individuals living 
with kidney disease.\51\

    In addition to these select research activities and efforts, NIMHD 
remains committed to working with HHS partners to ensure that the 
elimination of health disparities remains a priority within NIH and 
across the HHS.
                               telehealth
    Question. The last 3 years have shown the benefits of telehealth 
services. I have been proud to partner with bipartisan colleagues to 
protect access to telehealth through initiatives, including the CONNECT 
for Health Act and my work with Senator Thune last Congress in the 
Senate Finance Committee on tele-mental health.

    Together, we secured an extension of telehealth flexibilities until 
the end of 2024, allowing your department and Congress to continue to 
ensure the appropriate flexibilities are made permanent.

    I want to thank you for working with us throughout the COVID-19 
pandemic to make telehealth accessible and predictable for those who 
came to rely on it. Still, we have seen disparities in access and 
quality of care.

    How is the administration proactively addressing these disparities 
and ensuring equitable access to high-quality care?

    As HHS winds down the Public Health Emergency (PHE) and we look 
towards permanent telehealth policies, how is HHS ensuring the 
collection of appropriate data to identify and prevent disparities in 
access to telehealth across department programs?

    How is HHS ensuring that Transformed Medical Statistical 
Information System (T-MSIS) data is complete and high quality in order 
to better assess telehealth modalities that have been rapidly deployed 
during the pandemic.

    Answer. In response to the COVID-19 public health emergency, which 
is set to expire in May 2023, flexibilities for Medicare telehealth 
services were issued through legislative and regulatory authorities to 
increase access to care for patients and providers. The Consolidated 
Appropriations Act of 2023 recently extended many of these 
flexibilities through December 31, 2024. Extended telehealth 
flexibilities include waiving geographic and site of service 
originating site restrictions so that Medicare patients can continue to 
use telehealth services from their home and allowing audio-only 
telehealth services. Additionally, the expanded list of providers 
eligible to deliver telehealth services is also extended so Medicare 
beneficiaries can continue to receive telehealth services furnished by 
physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech language 
pathologists, and audiologists, as well as receive telehealth services 
from Rural Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers 
through December 31, 2024. If you are interested in drafting 
legislation to make these waivers permanent, CMS would be happy to 
provide technical assistance.

    Additionally, recent legislative and regulatory changes made 
several telehealth flexibilities permanent. Federally Qualified Health 
Centers and Rural Health Clinics can furnish certain behavioral and 
mental health services via telecommunications technology. Medicare 
patients can continue to receive these telehealth services in their 
home as geographic restrictions on the originating site are eliminated 
for these telehealth services. Certain mental telehealth services can 
be delivered using audio-only communication platforms, and rural 
emergency hospitals can serve as an originating site for telehealth 
services.

    CMS would be happy to provide technical assistance on legislation 
to make these waivers permanent or any other legislation you have to 
expand access to telehealth.

    Data about Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who used 
telehealth services between January 1, 2020 and September 30, 2022, and 
a Medicare telehealth trends report, are available at https://
data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-use-and-payments/medicare-service-
type-reports/medicare-telehealth-trends. The data will be updated 
quarterly.

    For Medicaid and CHIP, telehealth flexibilities are not tied to the 
end of the PHE and have been offered by many State Medicaid programs 
long before the pandemic. Medicaid and CHIP telehealth policies will 
ultimately vary by State. CMS encourages States to continue to cover 
Medicaid and CHIP services when they are delivered via telehealth.

    Furthermore, The Health Resources and Services Administration 
(HRSA) supports the telehealth efforts of the Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) to expand access and improve health outcomes. In 
particular, HRSA's telehealth programs promote and advance telehealth 
services in rural and underserved areas. HHS oversees 
Telehealth.HHS.gov, which is a one-stop resource for patients, 
providers, and States for information about telehealth such as 
telehealth best practices, policy and reimbursement updates, funding 
opportunities, and more.

    In addition, from September 1, 2021 to August 31, 2022, HRSA's 
Telehealth Resource Centers provided responses to over 6,000 technical 
assistance requests to assist providers with implementing telehealth 
and understanding evolving telehealth policy. Further, HRSA's 
Telehealth Network Grant Program for emergency services promotes rural 
tele-emergency services by enhancing telehealth networks to deliver 24-
hour Emergency Department consultation services via telehealth to rural 
providers without emergency care specialists. In the most recent 
reporting cycle, this program served approximately 13,000 patients.

    HRSA's Licensure Portability Grant program is another key resource 
for increasing access to health-care services. It provides support for 
State professional licensing boards to work together to reduce the 
burden on clinicians who provide telehealth services in multiple 
States. Through this program, the Federation of State Medical Boards 
developed the Provider Bridge to make it easier for professionals to 
practice across State lines. Over 145,000 providers registered to use 
the platform.

    The FY 2024 budget request would enable HRSA to continue the HHS 
Telehealth Hub, support the Telehealth Resource Center Program, fund 
Telehealth Network Grant Program awards, and recompete the Licensure 
Portability Grant program, among other efforts to proactively address 
disparities in access and quality of care.

    To identify and prevent disparities in access to telehealth, the 
budget request would help HRSA to track funding, projects, and data for 
telehealth services and provide a systematic way of capturing data from 
programs and activities within HRSA's Office for the Advancement of 
Telehealth that could help inform overall performance of award 
recipients and their outcomes.
                      health systems strengthening
    Question. The President's budget includes significant resources to 
prepare for future pandemics, including bolstering the surveillance, 
laboratory, and public health workforce capacities of the U.S. Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

    The CDC has been clear that a disease threat anywhere in the world 
is a disease threat everywhere in the world. To that end, the CDC has 
routinely exchanged scientific expertise and data with other nations, 
worked alongside other agencies, such as the U.S. Agency for 
International Development and the State Department, to help strengthen 
health systems and workforces abroad.

    How will investments from the FY24 budget allow the Department of 
Health and Human Services to contribute to global health systems 
strengthening as a critical component of pandemic preparedness and 
global health security?

    Answer. As the United States' lead public health agency with 
decades of experience responding to infectious disease threats, CDC 
works 24/7 to protect the health and safety of Americans. CDC works on 
behalf of the American people to save lives around the world, 
partnering with other nations to prevent, prepare for, and respond to 
infectious disease threats.

    CDC is uniquely suited to use its expertise to support partner 
governments in building health programs, address health threats, 
enhance sustainable and country-owned public health systems, and 
improve health outcomes for all. CDC experts work alongside local, 
regional, and global partners across their global health portfolio to 
provide unparalleled expertise in data analytics, disease and vector 
surveillance, diagnostics, laboratory systems, workforce development, 
emergency preparedness, and outbreak response.

    CDC's global health security efforts help detect and contain 
outbreaks quickly, before they spread, cause deaths, and disrupt the 
economy. The most effective and least expensive way to protect 
Americans from diseases and other health threats that begin overseas is 
to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks before they spread to the 
United States.

    In FY 2024, with additional funding requested in the FY 2024 
budget, CDC will continue to:

          Build a strong cadre of international disease detectives 
        through expanded education in surveillance, leadership and 
        management, and emergency response through the Field 
        Epidemiology Training Program (FETP). Helping countries to 
        build up their own robust and self-sufficient public health 
        workforce capable of rapidly handling outbreaks within their 
        region is the foundation for sustainable long-term global 
        health security.
          Work side-by-side with countries and partners to strengthen 
        global public health systems, including developing disease 
        surveillance systems that enable disease detection, tracking 
        and reporting, as well as helping to build more effective 
        public health laboratories, both of which can be leveraged to 
        respond to new and emerging threats globally to contain spread.
          Invest in the public health systems needed for HIV testing, 
        prevention, and control. CDC's HIV-focused investments not only 
        build the foundations for an efficient, sustainable, 
        accountable, and high-impact response to HIV, but also, CDC's 
        unique approach to implementing global HIV programs create 
        platforms that play an essential role in the global response to 
        COVID-19 and many other emerging and re-emerging public health 
        threats.
          Build capacity through collaborations with countries 
        experiencing the highest burden of vaccine-preventable diseases 
        to achieve sustainability of their own immunization programs 
        and surveillance systems.
          Help countries establish public health emergency management 
        programs and Emergency Operation Centers (EOCs) to prepare for, 
        respond to, contain, and recover from public health threats. 
        With additional resources, CDC will scale and adapt its 
        emergency management technical assistance to provide more 
        support across regions and to countries at their national and 
        sub-national levels.
          Enhance workforce training, research and diagnostic 
        development, and innovative approaches to surveillance and 
        early detection for rapid outbreak response across areas such 
        as antimicrobial resistance, food and water-borne diseases, 
        high consequence pathogens (viral hemorrhagic fevers, anthrax, 
        etc.) and vector-borne diseases.
          Ensure the access to vaccines for influenza and meningitis 
        and maintain the primary global resource of respiratory 
        laboratory reagents for outbreaks to support global partners to 
        prevent, detect, and respond to respiratory disease threats.

    Additionally, in alignment with the Global Health Security Agenda 
(GHSA) 2024 vision, CDC will enhance ongoing efforts to strengthen 
global health security, with a focus on strengthening the core public 
health capacities that countries need to prevent, detect, and respond 
to infectious disease threats within their border. Building upon CDC 
country platforms, CDC intends to expand global health security in-
country staffing in 19 intensive support countries to strengthen direct 
collaboration with ministry of health counterparts and provide more 
hands-on technical assistance and oversight of CDC-supported global 
health security programs to accelerate progress.
                     violence intervention programs
    Question. Gun shot injuries cost the health-care system between $1 
billion to $2.8 billion a year. That is without taking into account 
other costs surrounding these injuries, such as expenses related to 
police, jails, lost wages to both victims and perpetrators, and more.

    Under President Biden's leadership, we have taken significant steps 
to reduce violent crime from the American Rescue Plan Act to the 
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.

    In June 2021, the administration announced the White House 
Community Violence Collaborative of cities using American Rescue Plan 
Act (ARPA) funding to strengthen community violence intervention (CVI) 
programs. Baltimore City took part in this, and thanks to funding from 
ARPA, the city is investing over $50 million in the coming years on a 
comprehensive violence prevention strategy. This includes CVI programs, 
victim support services, case management, emergency housing, and 
reentry services.

    Additionally, the administration has placed a focus on hospital-
based violence prevention programs and called on States to expand 
Medicaid to cover these services. I am proud that Maryland General 
Assembly passed legislation last year to do so.

    I was pleased to see the President's continued call for strong 
investments in community violence intervention programs in the 
President's budget.

    Can you comment on the importance of also having a public health 
approach to combat violent crime and the administration's commitment to 
this work?

    Answer. Violence is a widespread public health problem that impacts 
all of us and has a profound impact on lifelong health and well-being. 
The causes of violence are complex and require a comprehensive public 
health approach complementary to a public safety and criminal justice 
approach. CDC's public health approach focuses on early intervention: 
engaging people in prevention strategies before they intersect with the 
justice system, with the goal that they never become a perpetrator or 
victim of violence.

    Like disease, violence is preventable. A public health approach 
uses the same scientific methods to prevent violence that have been 
used to prevent disease: collecting data to understand trends and 
differences across groups, supporting research to develop prevention 
strategies and to understand what works, and taking steps to ensure 
that proven strategies are implemented in communities nationwide.

    Public health draws on a science base that is multi-disciplinary. 
It relies on knowledge from a broad range of disciplines including 
medicine, epidemiology, sociology, psychology, criminology, education, 
and economics. The public health approach also emphasizes input from 
diverse sectors including health, education, social services, justice, 
and the private sector. Collective action on the part of these key 
collaborators is important for addressing problems like violence.

    CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System pools information 
from multiple data sources into a usable, anonymous database describing 
the circumstances of homicides and suicides in all 50 States, 
Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. CDC also currently funds 9 Injury 
Control Research Centers studying how to prevent injuries and violence 
and working with community partners to put those findings into action. 
Additionally, CDC funds 5 Youth Violence Prevention Centers to target 
youths in communities with high rates of violence. CDC has developed 
technical packages specifically for preventing adverse childhood 
experiences, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, sexual 
violence, youth violence, and suicide for use as tools for communities, 
States, territories, and partner groups to plan and implement violence 
prevention efforts.

    CDC has a long history of working with multiple sectors at the 
community level to improve health and well-being. Public health leads 
violence prevention efforts in the context of underlying contributors 
that are beyond the reach of the justice sector, such as substance use, 
community design, and concentrated poverty. As a result, CDC is well 
positioned to partner with health-care workers, as well as health 
organizations such as hospitals, mental and behavioral health systems, 
insurance providers, schools, and others to prevent violence and 
mitigate its consequences.
                              hepatitis c
    Question. As you know, hepatitis C is a liver infection caused by a 
blood-borne virus that can lead to acute or chronic infection and cause 
liver disease and cancer. The number of Americans impacted by hepatitis 
C has more than doubled since 2013, with more than 2.5 million people 
nationwide infected. This includes over 100,000 Marylanders. However, 
over 40 percent of people infected are unaware because they are 
asymptomatic.

    Acute and chronic hepatitis C disproportionately affect American 
Indian and Alaska Natives, Black Americans, people aged 20 to 39 and 55 
to 70, those without insurance, and those with substance use disorders.

    The President's budget proposes bold action to eliminate hepatitis 
C through a new 5-year initiative, the National Hepatitis Elimination 
Program, which would enhance screening, testing, treatment, and 
prevention efforts with a focus on the 
highest-risk populations.

    Can you discuss the importance of eliminating hepatitis C and why 
it is within our reach if we choose to invest in it?
Importance of Eliminating Hepatitis C
    Answer. Recent published data indicates that the rates of acute 
hepatitis C quadruped from 2010 to 2020 among adults aged 20-39 years, 
mirroring increasing rates of overdose deaths fueled by the Nation's 
opioid and methamphetamine crises. Untreated hepatitis C can lead to 
cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer, and a wide range of extra-
hepatic disease processes, such as cryoglobulinemia, depression, and 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma which often occur in the absence of clinical liver 
disease and have extensive direct and indirect costs of their own.

    One study estimated that a 2-year delay in access to the direct-
acting antivirals (DAAs) can lead to increased hepatitis virus-related 
morbidity and mortality by 15 percent \52\ If these patients are left 
untreated, up to 30 percent will develop liver cirrhosis after 20 years 
\53\ and of these, about 4 percent of patients a year will develop 
liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). The cost of treating liver 
complications such as liver failure and transplantation once the 
disease has advanced far exceeds the costs related to the treatment of 
HCV before any of these complications occur.

    To put it in context using a 2014 data,\54\ the proportion of in-
hospital stay involving HCV on average were higher in cost ($13,300 
versus $11,600); longer (5.8 versus 4.7 days) and more likely to result 
in death in the hospital (2.9 versus 2.2 percent of stays) compared to 
the in-hospital stays that did not involve HCV.

    Yet, we have safe and effective oral treatment--DAAs that can cure 
greater than 95 percent of infected people in 8 to 12 weeks. This cure 
is one of the most dramatic scientific achievements of the last few 
decades; however, it is not reaching the population who needs it most. 
Among those diagnosed, only one-third with private insurance and one-
quarter with Medicaid and Medicare received timely treatment (within 
360 days of diagnosis).\55\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why it Is Within Our Reach if We Choose To Invest in it
    The United States is currently not on track to reach elimination 
goals outlined in the Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan 2021-2025 
due to limited investment in hepatitis C. Reasons for the slow progress 
include low screening and diagnosis of hepatitis C, the 
disproportionate impact of hepatitis C on marginalized populations, 
increasing rates of hepatitis C in young adults due to the opioid 
epidemic, gaps in linking patients to care, and insurance restrictions 
to treatment.

    Broad access to curative hepatitis C medications: Early treatment 
with the new DAAs offers savings in medical costs, by offsetting part 
of the initial expense, and improving health status. In a model 
analysis published in a study, it estimated that waiting to initiate 
treatment in advanced stages of HCV will cost billions of dollars in 
medical and treatment expenditure over decades with little reduction in 
prevalence.\56\ The same study also estimated that by front loading 
expenditures, to treat all HCV diagnosis regardless of the extent of 
liver damage will substantially lower prevalence within 10 years. In 
their estimation, over time, cumulative expenditure declines as 
transmission, prevalence, and incidence of disease decreases.

    Innovative testing development: Using the lessons learned from 
COVID-19, this initiative would accelerate approval of point-of-care 
RNA tests that are available outside of the U.S. but not in the U.S., 
by enlisting the Independent Test Assessment Program, an NIH-Food and 
Drug Administration partnership. Currently, in the U.S., the tests must 
be processed at off-site labs, forcing patients to return to obtain the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
results and further delaying their treatment and care.

    Population health and health equity: Investment in hepatitis C 
elimination is also an investment in addressing equity. Hepatitis C 
disproportionately affects populations experiencing other health and 
social inequities, including American Indian and Alaska Native persons, 
non-Hispanic Black persons, individuals without health insurance, 
justice-involved populations, and people who inject(ed) drugs. 
Hepatitis C also disproportionately affects baby boomers many of whom 
are eligible for Medicare. The prevalence of hepatitis C is at least 
five times higher among baby boomers than in any other group of adults, 
and baby boomers account for about 75 percent of hepatitis C cases 
(https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/baby-boomers-and-hepatitis-c-
whats-the-connection-2019050116532). Moreover, the diagnosis and 
treatment of hepatitis C in this group would result in significant 
savings for Medicare as it would identify those with long-duration 
chronic disease, who are at highest risk for the most advanced forms of 
liver disease.

    Lessons learned from tested models: The National Hepatitis C 
Elimination Program was developed by taking lessons learned from 
innovative programs from across the U.S., including from the States of 
Louisiana and Washington, the Cherokee Nation, the Veterans' Health 
Administration (VHA), and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. For example, 
from 2013 to March 2021, the VHA screened >85 percent of its population 
for hepatitis C. Of the 168,000 VHA patients diagnosed with hepatitis 
C, 90 percent have been treated, with a 90 percent cure rate. Model 
pilot programs across the country have provided the evidence base for 
nationwide scale-up of successful strategies. Investment in these 
strategies will prevent needless suffering for patients and their loved 
ones.

    It is estimated that the National Hepatitis C Elimination Program 
will diagnose 92.5 percent and cure 89.6 percent of all people living 
with hepatitis C within 5 years if we act now.

               Questions Submitted by Hon. Sherrod Brown
      funding for children's hospitals graduate medical education
    Question. The Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education 
(CHGME) program is vital for training the next generation of 
pediatricians. The children's hospitals that receive this funding train 
about half of all our Nation's pediatricians and a majority of 
pediatric specialists. Despite the program's success, CHGME has 
consistently received far less Federal funding than provided to 
graduate medical education for adult providers. The President's budget 
for FY 2024 proposes $385 million for CHGME--the same Congress 
appropriated for FY 2023. Our Nation is facing a health-care workforce 
crisis, and we lack the pediatric specialty providers necessary to care 
for our children. I am concerned that the lack of increase in funding 
further jeopardizes the ability for our country to maintain a robust 
pediatric workforce.

    Will you work with me to ensure that we prioritize CHGME moving 
forward to protect children's access to care?

    Answer. Thank you for your support of the Children's Hospitals 
Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) program. We recognize the importance 
of having an adequate number of pediatric providers and ensuring 
children have ongoing access to the specialized care they need across 
provider settings. This important program supports pediatric providers 
and promote access to health care.

    The FY 2024 President's budget proposal for the CHGME program would 
enable HRSA to continue to support resident physician full-time 
equivalent placements training in free-standing children's hospitals. 
We look forward to working with Congress to provide sufficient funding 
to strengthen the pediatric workforce and expand access to care for 
children through the CHGME program.
          access to vaccines for adult medicaid beneficiaries
    Question. When Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, it 
included legislation I sponsored requiring access to all recommended 
vaccines at no cost for low-income adults who are Medicaid 
beneficiaries, regardless of what State they live in. The President's 
FY 2024 budget supports CMS activities to implement this benefit.

    Could you share an update on CMS's implementation of section 11405?

    How is CMS assisting States in getting ready for the October 1, 
2023, effective date for these changes to adult immunization coverage 
in their Medicaid programs?

    Answer. The Inflation Reduction Act addresses longstanding gaps by 
requiring coverage of vaccinations for adults under Medicaid and CHIP. 
Starting October 1, 2023, most adults enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP will 
have coverage of approved adult vaccines recommended by the Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices, and the administration of those 
vaccines without cost sharing. Increasing access to recommended 
vaccines is an effective strategy to improve the health of Medicaid 
adults and, more broadly, the health of communities. CMS is committed 
to working closely with States to ensure they have the tools and 
resources they need to ensure they are able to meet these new 
requirements.

  implementation of the technical reset to advance the instruction of 
nurses (train) act (section 4143 of the consolidated appropriations act 
                         for fiscal year 2023)
    Question. Congress included bipartisan legislation I introduced 
with Senator Capito, the TRAIN Act, as section 4143 of the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act (CAA) for FY 2023, which was signed into law in 
December. This provision ensures eligible hospital-based nursing 
schools and allied health training programs be held harmless for excess 
funds inadvertently disbursed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS) as part of Medicare Advantage Nursing and Allied Health 
Professional Education Payments in past years. Because this legislation 
was not enacted until after most of these overpayments had been clawed 
back, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) must now 
repay these funds to the affected schools.

    A March 16, 2023, CMS Transmittal Notice (Transmittal 11904, Change 
Request 13122), set forth instructions to implement this section, 
including a complicated formula to calculate the payments owed to 
schools. However, it is my understanding that a number of schools that 
have used these instructions to determine what they will get repaid 
have found that they will only be reimbursed between 29 percent and 37 
percent of what was clawed back by CMS. That is not what was intended. 
My office and Senator Capito's office worked closely with CMS on this 
provision. Our intention was to ensure that all schools be held 
harmless--that they have all of the clawed-back funds returned to them.

    How did CMS determine the formula for the repayments required under 
section 4143 of the CAA?

    How does CMS intend to ensure these schools are held harmless for 
the overpayments, as per congressional intent?

    Answer. CMS has recently been made aware of this issue, and I know 
that folks are working to clarify any confusion. CMS is committed to 
implementing this provision of the CAA correctly.
              access to childhood vaccines at pharmacies 
                  through the end of fiscal year 2024
    Question. Every year, thousands of Ohioans turn to trusted 
pharmacists in their communities to receive vaccinations. Vaccines are 
essential in protecting and preserving the health of communities, and 
health equity depends on vaccine access. Ohioans now expect that they 
can access vaccines at their local pharmacies, particularly in minority 
and underserved communities, where the pharmacy may be the easiest, 
most convenient place to receive vaccinations. The Federal PREP Act 
included the authority for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to 
perform all vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for children 
ages 3-18 until October 1, 2024.

    Could you confirm that HHS intends to maintain these authorizations 
until October 1, 2024?

    Answer. If a need is determined, the Secretary is able to amend 
coverage post the duration of a declared Public Health Emergency for 
PREP Act coverage for select groups of providers. At the time of the 
hearing, there are conversations around extending coverage.
           home respiratory therapy medicare coverage after 
                      the public health emergency
    Question. I understand that CMS plans to continue Medicare coverage 
without additional documentation for patients who began home 
respiratory therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic once the public health 
emergency is ended. Will CMS provide guidance to ensure that these 
patients continue to receive these services without interruption?

    My understanding is that CMS contractors rely on physician notes in 
the medical record as the only source for determining medical necessity 
for home respiratory therapy. CMS's data indicates that contractors 
deny the majority of these claims even when the patient qualifies for 
services. Though CMS has developed a standardized template form that 
physicians could use to ensure they are providing the information the 
contractors need to review claims, CMS does not require its contractors 
to adopt this approach. This puts patient access to home respiratory 
therapy at risk. Could you explain why CMS has not implemented a 
requirement to use this standardized template and whether the 
contractors will be required to use this type of documentation when the 
public health emergency ends?

    Answer. CMS recognizes that it is important for stakeholders to 
understand how CMS anticipates performing medical review after the 
Public Health Emergency (PHE) has ended. During the PHE, flexibilities 
were applied to medical reviews across claim types. For certain DME 
items, this included the non-enforcement of clinical indications for 
coverage. Since clinical indications for coverage were not enforced for 
certain DME items provided during the PHE, once the PHE ends CMS plans 
to primarily focus reviews on claims with dates of service outside of 
the PHE, for which clinical indications of coverage are applicable. CMS 
may still review these DME items, as well as other items or services 
rendered during the PHE, if needed to address aberrant billing 
behaviors or potential fraud. The HHS-Office of the Inspector General 
may perform reviews as well. All claims will be reviewed using the 
applicable rules in place at the time for the claim dates of service. 
As the PHE comes to an end, CMS will continue to work with stakeholders 
to ensure beneficiary access.

    CMS has designed printable clinical templates and suggested 
clinical data elements (CDEs) to assist providers and IT professionals 
with data collection and medical record documentation to support 
coverage of selected items and services. These templates and suggested 
CDEs are intended to help reduce the risk of claim denials and ensure 
that medical record documentation is more complete. Specifically, CMS 
released a clinical template and suggested CDEs for ordering home 
oxygen therapy. The template is designed to assist a clinician when 
completing an order for home oxygen therapy to meet requirements for 
Medicare eligibility and coverage. The template meets the requirements 
for both the Detailed Written Order and Written Order Prior to 
Delivery, and is available to the clinician and can be kept on file 
with the patient's medical record or can be used to develop an order 
template for use with the system containing the patient's electronic 
medical record. While completing the Home Oxygen Therapy Order Template 
does not guarantee eligibility and coverage, it does provide guidance 
in support of home oxygen therapy equipment and services ordered and 
billed to Medicare. CMS has also released clinical templates and 
suggested CDEs for documenting the face-to-face encounter for Medicare 
home oxygen therapy eligibility and coverage and for documenting 
information regarding home oxygen therapy laboratory test results to 
meet requirements for Medicare coverage for home oxygen therapy. The 
home oxygen therapy templates and suggested CDEs are available at: 
https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Computer-Data-
and-Systems/Electronic-Clinical-Templates/template-and-CDE-downloads.

    At this time, use of these templates and suggested CDEs is 
voluntary; however, we welcome provider and stakeholder feedback and 
suggestions on how to improve all our templates and CDEs.

                                 ______
                                 
             Questions Submitted by Hon. Michael F. Bennet
                        antimicrobial resistance
    Question. According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), in just the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. 
hospitals experienced a 15-
percent increase in both infections and deaths from drug-resistant 
bacteria. To prepare for the next pandemic or superbug, we need to 
address the broken drug pipeline. My legislation with Senator Young, 
the PASTEUR Act, which we've talked about, would incentivize new 
antimicrobial drug development at a small fraction of the cost that 
antibiotic resistance imposes on American patients and consumers and 
will jumpstart the next generation of drugs that will make that 
possible. I appreciate that HHS includes a $9 billion proposal in 
mandatory funding for a subscription model to incentivize the 
development of novel antibiotics.

    Can you tell me more about the administration's proposal for 
antimicrobial pull incentives included in your budget to tackle this 
problem?

    Can we work together to get it passed this year as part of the 
Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) reauthorization?

    Answer. To mitigate the threat of antimicrobial resistance, the 
U.S. Government is taking a multipronged approach that includes 
surveillance, prevention, stewardship and innovation of new products to 
treat and prevent infections. However, the value of reduced morbidity, 
mortality, and disease duration is not currently captured by many 
antimicrobial products' current market value, and many large 
pharmaceutical companies have stopped investing in new antimicrobial 
products. The majority of products currently in clinical trials are 
being developed by small companies without the infrastructure and 
economies of larger firms--these small companies face difficulty self-
funding commercialization and Phase 4 studies and the development 
pipeline is at significant risk of falling short of current and future 
needs.

    The FY 2024 President's budget mandatory proposal is intended to 
create an incentive for a more robust pipeline of novel antimicrobial 
products while enhancing stewardship. The proposal would allow for 
contracts to be established between sponsors of selected products and 
HHS, valued at between $750 million and $3 billion, paid in annual 
increments for up to 10 years or through the length of protection or 
exclusivity. The proposal would establish an interagency committee to 
identify infections for which new antimicrobial drugs are needed and to 
develop regulations outlining favored characteristics and assigned 
monetary values, an application process for product sponsors, how 
contracts would be established, and how characteristics would be 
weighed. The proposal addresses patient access to these products by 
requiring assurances from sponsors regarding supply chain and supply 
adequacy. Building on the strength ongoing programs like CARB-X, this 
proposal would allow the HHS Secretary to work with private payors and 
global partners to participate in a similar mechanism.

    We have appreciated the opportunities to provide technical 
assistance on previous versions of the PASTEUR Act and would be happy 
to do so in the future. Similarly, we look forward to engaging with you 
on reauthorization of PAHPA.

    Question. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the misuse and 
overprescribing of antibiotics which has increased the spread of 
antimicrobial resistance in the United States and around the world. 
Recent examples of resistance include the eye drop recall and the 
alarming spread of Candida auris--a deadly fungal infection--in 
hospitals. Diagnostic tests are not adequately being utilized prior to 
the prescription of an antibiotic.

    How will HHS help support efforts to decrease empiric antimicrobial 
therapy?

    What kinds of policies might you propose to help address 
stewardship and improve the use of diagnostic tests?

    Answer. Through the 2020-2025 National Action Plan for Combating 
Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CARB), HHS is working with Federal, 
State, and local partners to implement a suite of complementary actions 
to combat antibiotic resistance. The National Action Plan for CARB 
includes two goals particularly relevant to appropriate antibiotic use. 
Goal 2 supports antibiotic stewardship, which guides appropriate 
antibiotic use and thereby reduces the opportunities for resistance to 
develop. Goal 3 supports the development and appropriate use of 
diagnostic tests to provide the right antibiotic at the right time in 
the right dose.

    CDC, AHRQ, and CMS support the development, evaluation, and 
implementation of high-quality antibiotic stewardship programs across a 
variety of health-care settings. CDC's Core Elements of Antibiotic 
Stewardship offer providers and facilities a set of key principles to 
guide efforts to improve antibiotic use and, therefore, advance patient 
safety and improve outcomes; this guidance has been tailored for 
hospitals, outpatient settings, nursing homes, and resource-limited 
settings. The AHRQ Safety Program for Improving Antibiotic Use was 
developed to help clinicians in hospitals, doctors offices, and long-
term care apply the Four Moments of Antibiotic Decision Making and 
concepts derived from the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program 
(CUSP) to improve antibiotic stewardship by selecting the optimal 
antibiotic regimens, routes of administration, and durations. AHRQ and 
partners assessed the Safety Program's impact on patient safety culture 
and antibiotic prescribing practices across a total of 1,304 
participating sites throughout the United States, including 476 units 
from 402 acute care hospitals, 439 long-term care facilities, and 389 
ambulatory care centers. Results indicate that the Safety Program aided 
participating sites to develop and enhance their Antibiotic Stewardship 
activities and to reduce antibiotic prescribing. At the end of each 
intervention, a toolkit was developed that contained materials 
developed for each cohort as well as additional information to allow 
sites that did not participate to recreate the Safety Program at their 
own facilities. CMS works closely with CDC in the development of its 
antibiotic stewardship program requirements as well as the interpretive 
guidelines that support these regulations. Through its published rules 
and guidance, CMS has strongly encouraged health-care facilities to use 
CDC's Core Elements of Antibiotic Stewardship as a basis for 
establishing antibiotic stewardship programs in Medicare-participating 
facilities. In 2022, CMS published updates to interpretive guidance for 
hospital requirements under the Medicare and Medicaid Programs; 
Regulatory Provisions to Promote Program Efficiency, Transparency, and 
Burden Reduction Final Rule, which revised the regulatory requirements 
for hospitals related to infection prevention and control and 
antibiotic stewardship programs.

    CDC, AHRQ, NIH, and FDA are working under the National Action Plan 
for CARB to fund research to better understand the appropriate use of 
diagnostic testing to address bacterial or fungal infections, and to 
use that evidence to promote the appropriate use of new and existing 
diagnostics that determine the presence, severity, or antimicrobial 
susceptibility or resistance of bacterial or fungal infections in human 
clinical care. For example, CDC used data from their Gonococcal Isolate 
Surveillance Project to guide updates to the 2020 gonorrhea treatment 
recommendations published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. 
These data were used in determining recommended treatment regimens and 
for test-of-cure testing recommendations.

    HHS agencies continue to monitor the implementation of these 
activities to understand their impact and develop additional proposals 
to support appropriate antibiotic use, including through improved 
diagnostic testing. For example, the FY 2024 President's budget 
includes a proposal for CDC to advance laboratory science through 
shortening the time to develop diagnostic tests, evaluating and 
implementing new detection technologies, increasing the number of tests 
results available per day, ensuring the quality of test results, 
improving laboratory safety and efficiency, and developing uniform 
quality practice standards for CDC and other public health labs. The FY 
2024 President's budget request for AHRQ includes an investment in 
research grants and contracts to explore how to address different 
diagnostic safety challenges and create the infrastructure for 
continued research to prevent errors and delays in diagnosis.
                           diagnostic testing
    Question. Due to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 
(PAMA), laboratory diagnostics and point-of-care testing reimbursement 
has experienced continued downward reimbursement, reducing common 
diagnostic testing reimbursement by up to 10 percent year over year. 
Without congressional intervention, reimbursement reductions are 
scheduled to continue under PAMA.

    Considering the critical role diagnostic testing has in our health-
care industry and in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, how do you plan 
to address reimbursement rates to maintain long-term access to testing?

    Answer. The Department shares your desire to protect Medicare 
beneficiaries' access to laboratory testing services and provide 
stakeholders with transparency and predictability around reimbursement 
for laboratory tests. Congress enacted PAMA with a phase-in for 
reductions such that for CY 2017 through CY 2019, the reduction cannot 
be more than 10 percent per year, and for CY 2020 through CY 2022, the 
reduction cannot be more than 15 percent per year. Congress 
subsequently modified PAMA in legislation four different times to 
maintain the payment amount for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test 
for CY 2021 through CY 2023 at the payment amount for CY 2020 and to 
limit reductions to 15 percent per year for CY 2024 through CY 2026. If 
Congress wants to make further modifications to the phase-in of 
reductions under PAMA, we would be happy to provide technical 
assistance on legislation you draft.

    Question. When the Public Health Emergency ends on May 11th, many 
private payers have indicated they will no longer cover and reimburse 
COVID-19 tests done at point of care--meaning in pharmacies, urgent 
care centers and physician office labs.

    What is your plan to work with private payers to ensure all 
Americans have access to point of care COVID-19 testing?

    Answer. The requirement for group health plans and health insurance 
issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage to cover 
COVID-19 tests without cost sharing, both for over-the-counter and 
laboratory tests, will end at the end of the Public Health Emergency 
(PHE). However, plans and issuers are encouraged to continue to provide 
this coverage, without imposing cost sharing or medical management 
requirements, after the PHE ends.

    Question. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does 
not have regulatory oversight of laboratory diagnostic tests, leaving 
patients at risk of faulty high-risk tests and increasing the potential 
of inaccurate diagnosis and treatment. I've collaborated for many years 
with the FDA and stakeholders on the Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge 
IVCT Development (VALID) Act, which would create a risk-based 
regulatory framework at the FDA to oversee these tests. I'm glad that 
the FDA plans to move forward in their current authority to draft 
regulations, but I'm also surprised that the FY 2024 HHS Budget did not 
include the VALID Act as a policy priority.

    Under which authorities do you believe that FDA can promulgate 
regulations on diagnostic test oversight?

    Answer. In vitro diagnostic products (IVDs) are devices under the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act). FDA has authority 
to promulgate regulations for IVDs under the agency's general 
rulemaking authorities and statutory authorities relating to devices 
under the FD&C Act.

    Question. Can you provide a timeline of when the public should 
expect proposed regulations or sub-regulatory guidance?

    Answer. At this time, we cannot provide a timeline.

    Question. Do you and the FDA support the VALID Act and can you 
explain why it wasn't included in the budget?

    Answer. Yes. FDA supports legislation to establish a modern 
regulatory framework for diagnostic tests under the Federal Food, Drug 
and Cosmetic Act, such as the VALID Act. The legislative proposals in 
the budget FY 2024 summary are legislative proposals originating from 
FDA, whereas VALID is a legislative proposal originating from Congress. 
Diagnostic test reform remains one of FDA's top legislative priorities 
for reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act. A 
modern oversight framework that is specifically tailored to in vitro 
diagnostics will help us position ourselves for the future--whether it 
is preparing for the next pandemic or realizing the full potential of 
diagnostic innovation. The past few years have highlighted the critical 
need for a modern regulatory framework that strikes the appropriate 
balance to promote innovation while also ensuring patients have access 
to accurate and reliable diagnostics. FDA stands ready to continue 
working with Congress on diagnostic testing reform.
                         unaccompanied children
    Question. For nearly 10 years, Democratic and Republican 
administrations have failed to care for unaccompanied children who come 
to the United States. I've continued to raise concerns, when they have 
been wrongfully detained under Flores or held in closed cells intended 
for medical isolation. As of this week, nearly 8,000 children are under 
HHS care, but there are likely tens of thousands more who are out of 
HHS custody in the United States and face high risk of trauma and 
health conditions. In the past three budgets, HHS has requested the 
same amount, $5.5 billion, but, as far as I can tell, we haven't seen 
improved outcomes and care for these children. In fact, we're now 
hearing reports that employers are exploiting them to work in meat 
packing facilities and other factories, which is shameful.

    What is HHS meaningfully doing to strengthen care for kids in their 
custody?

    Answer. HHS's Administration of Children and Families' (ACF) Office 
of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) is dedicated to ensuring the safety and 
well-being of children in our care from the time they enter our custody 
following a referral from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or 
other Federal entity until they are safely placed with a vetted 
sponsor.

    ORR has made and continues to make significant investments in 
acquiring additional bed capacity to provide a safe environment and 
place children in the least restrictive setting appropriate for their 
needs. Since 2021, ORR has nearly doubled its standard network bed 
capacity, and has achieved this by safely bringing back online beds 
that were previously impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, partnering with 
current providers to provide additional bed capacity through recipient-
initiated supplements, engaging non-governmental organizations and 
governmental jurisdictions to identify ways to expand bed capacity, and 
publishing notices of funding opportunities (NOFOs) for licensed or 
soon-to-be-licensed programs.

    While ORR's custodial responsibilities end when a child is released 
from ORR care, ORR provides post-release services (PRS) for children 
and sponsors who would benefit from ongoing connections to community 
services. ORR also conducts follow-up by phone with both the sponsor 
and child after the child is released from ORR care to help continue 
and facilitate a child's successful transition into their community and 
encourage permanency.

    ORR is also expanding PRS tailored to the unique needs of each 
child. In FY 2022, ORR more than doubled the rate of children provided 
with PRS, serving more than 40 percent of children compared to just 
over 20 percent in FY 2021. ORR has been developing and progressing 
with the implementation of expanded PRS, including a pilot project in 
September 2022. This full rollout is anticipated to start January 1, 
2024, and expanded PRS will consist of three levels of services, which 
may be elevated at any time, ranging from Level 1 (consisting of three 
check-ins) to Level 3 (involving intensive, in-person case management). 
Safety and Well-Being Calls will be categorized under ``Level 1 
Services,'' where three in-person or virtual comprehensive check-ins 
are conducted with the unaccompanied child and sponsor at 7 days, 14 
days, and 30 days following release from ORR care.

    ORR continues to expand access to legal representation to children, 
consistent with the requirements of law. In FY 2021, 13,579 children 
received direct representation in their immigration proceedings through 
ORR's contractor, and in FY 2022, this number increased to 16,299 
children. Over the coming year, ORR plans to reach a historic expansion 
in direct representation by funding an additional 15,000 direct 
representation cases. ORR will achieve this by bringing on new legal 
service providers in high release counties, where there has not 
historically been immigration legal representation. This includes 
intensive training and language support for these new providers, which 
will help build long-term capacity in the field. Simultaneously, ORR is 
working to increase funding and capacity for direct legal 
representation for unaccompanied children, with the goal of ensuring 
that all children in ORR care and discharged children can access legal 
representation by the end of calendar year 2027.

    In addition to expanding legal representation through the current 
and new contracts, ORR developed a legal services recruitment pipeline 
project in order to build capacity in the field and ensure that ORR can 
continue to meet increased demand for legal services year after year. 
ORR estimates that this project will lead the recruitment of over 4,000 
new attorneys entering the immigration field over the next 5 years, 
with more than 100,000 unaccompanied children matched with 
representation under this program.

    Question. How does HHS plan to improve their follow-up procedures 
for kids who are no longer in HHS custody to ensure they aren't being 
exploited?

    Answer. HHS recognizes that unaccompanied children face unique 
challenges that require a whole-of-government response, which is why we 
engage with different entities across the Federal Government and 
nationally in support of efforts to ensure the safety and well-being of 
unaccompanied children. Any child being in a dangerous or exploitative 
situation is cause for concern, and HHS takes action to provide 
services and referrals, including reports to law enforcement and child 
welfare authorities, as appropriate, as well as to examine our 
processes and policies to identify and address any gaps.

    On February 28, 2023, ACF finalized a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) 
between ORR, the Office on Trafficking in Persons, and the National 
Center for Missing and Exploited Children where all parties share 
information on a weekly basis for the purpose of assisting one another 
to locate and assess the safety and well-being of unaccompanied 
children, former unaccompanied children, and foreign national minors 
who are reported missing or who may be subject to trafficking or 
exploitative activity. The MOA helps bridge data-sharing gaps and 
allows ORR to receive information on potential trafficking trends or 
concerns with potential sponsors and document this critical information 
in ORR's official system of record, the Unaccompanied Children Portal, 
to inform ORR's case management considerations. The MOA also advances 
priority actions as outlined in the National Action Plan to Combat 
Human Trafficking, recommendations articulated by the National Advisory 
Committee on the Sex Trafficking of Children and Youth in the United 
States, and recommendations articulated by members of the National 
Human Trafficking Training and Technical Assistance Center's Human 
Trafficking Leadership Academy.

    ORR's interagency efforts to conduct due diligence to prevent and 
respond to the child labor issue is ongoing. The recent MOA between the 
Department of Labor's (DOL) Wage and Hour Division and ACF, formalized 
on March 23, 2023, expands our collaborative work and will help to 
identify communities and employers where children may be at risk of 
child labor exploitation; aid investigations with information that 
could help identify circumstances where children are unlawfully 
employed; and further facilitate coordination to ensure that child 
labor trafficking victims or potential victims have access to critical 
services. HHS and DOL are also distributing new materials and trainings 
to provide information to children and sponsors about child labor laws 
in the United States so that children and sponsors understand the laws 
on labor rights and restrictions.

    In addition to increasing our efforts to better inform children, 
sponsors, and providers about child labor exploitation, ORR continues 
to improve how it prevents and responds to child labor issues, 
including ensuring follow-up calls to children with reported safety 
concerns to the ORR National Call Center (ORRNCC) and sharing 
information with children about where and to whom their concern was 
reported. ORRNCC is a valuable resource that is available 24 hours, 7 
days a week, where children, sponsors, family members, legal service 
providers, Child Advocates, and other members of the community can 
request assistance, report concerns, and be referred to essential 
community services to promote success and community permanence on the 
child's behalf. ORRNCC is required to document and report any safety 
concern, in accordance with mandatory reporting laws, State licensing 
requirements, Federal laws and regulations, and ORR policies and 
procedures to ORR, as well as to the appropriate local law enforcement 
agency, State and local child protective services, or both.

    Lastly, ORR has invested in proactive program quality and program 
management capabilities with child safety and well-being at its core. 
ORR created two new teams that aid its efforts to provide holistic 
support to children while in care and post-release: the Child Services 
Team and the Program Quality Team. The Child Services Team is 
responsible for continuing existing work that ensures children receive 
legal support; child advocacy, as needed; post-release services; and 
language access. This team also leads efforts to build out ORR's 
provision of appropriate education and vocational supports for all 
children in care as well as to engage with internal and external 
stakeholders to advance policies and procedures that prioritize child 
protection and family preservation for unaccompanied children, their 
caregivers, and broader communities. The Program Quality Team was 
established as a means of working continuously and collaboratively to 
use child welfare best practices to achieve and sustain improvement in 
services and outcomes for the children, youth, and families we serve. 
Under this team, ORR works on continuous quality improvement and 
emergent issues, internal monitoring and oversight of the care provider 
network, prevention of child abuse and neglect, and care provider 
engagement and performance management. Expanding the breadth of 
services post-release starts with internal accountability and 
sustainable program models to ensure the Unaccompanied Children Program 
continues to develop the tools it needs to serve the best interests of 
children.
                             child welfare
    Question. Just over 5 years ago, in February 2018, Chair Wyden and 
I successfully led the effort to pass the Family First Prevention 
Services Act (FFPSA). This legislation provided families with greater 
access to mental health services, substance use treatment, and/or 
parenting skills courses so that children, who might normally be placed 
in out-of-home care, could remain with their families at home. Since 
then, many States have taken up the option to shift their child welfare 
systems to better support prevention and reduce the number of kids 
removed form their home. Currently, there are 39 approved State, 
jurisdiction, and Tribal title IV-E prevention program plans to date 
have identified 13 well-supported, 5 supported, and 5 promising 
evidence-based programs (EBPs) and services for reimbursement in the 
delivery of prevention services.

    Can you provide an update on State implementation of the FFSPA and 
highlight the resources available for States that want to amend their 
State child welfare programs?

    Answer. States and Tribes are in various stages of development and 
implementation of title IV-E prevention plans. Currently, 42 
jurisdictions have approved title IV-E prevention program plans. The 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has made various 
technical assistance (TA) documents and toolkits available that can 
support jurisdictions' prevention planning and implementation. For 
example, the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and 
Evaluation has developed a toolkit about title IV-E prevention. 
Similarly, Children's Bureau's Center for States provides TA support. 
We understand that developing a comprehensive prevention plan takes 
time. Additionally, we know that many agencies continue to manage 
unprecedented workforce and leadership challenges and changes. Since 
the passage of FFPSA, the Center for States has provided customized 
support to State and territorial child welfare agencies developing and 
implementing prevention plans. To support these efforts, the Center for 
States provides a continuum of TA to jurisdictions, including the 
following:

          Providing tailored, expert coaching and consultation through 
        direct TA around prevention program plan development and 
        implementation and related efforts;
          Supporting peer groups that allow child welfare 
        professionals to virtually connect with colleagues working in 
        similar practice areas or on common initiatives;
          Developing and disseminating resources, including 
        publications and tools on prevention-focused systems and FFPSA;
          Conducting needs assessments related to prevention service 
        array (identifying candidates, needs, and analyzing service 
        array gaps), including providing support to States in selecting 
        appropriate prevention interventions;
          Refining internal processes related to in-home services and 
        provider relationships, such as effective in-home case planning 
        and service identification in partnership with families, 
        ongoing safety and risk monitoring, collaboration and coalition 
        building among partners, workforce support, training, and 
        coaching;
          Conducting strategic planning related to prevention program 
        plan development (including enhancing key partnerships related 
        to prevention) as well as efforts to come into alignment with 
        the National Model Foster Family Home Licensing Standards; and
          Ensuring children and youth are placed in settings that 
        align with their needs, reducing the use of congregate care, 
        and helping States conduct root cause analyses and strategic 
        planning related to changing the culture and climate of their 
        agencies, including shifts toward a more prevention-based 
        model.

    Question. Are there increased resources that the Administration for 
Children and Families needs to improve or encourage implementation of 
the FFSPA?

    Answer. Our FY 2024 budget proposes to build on the progress noted 
above by including a suite of proposals to enhance the title IV-E 
Prevention Services Program. Our proposals would increase Federal 
reimbursement for the program and, as you note, beginning in FY 2024, 
make permanent a temporary provision enacted through the Family First 
Transition Act requiring States to spend at least 50 percent for 
services that meet the supported and/or well-supported practice 
criteria (rather than applying that spending requirement to programs 
meeting the well-
supported practice criteria only). The proposal also would allow up to 
15 percent of a State's funding to be spent on services that do not 
currently meet the clearinghouse's evidence standards. As a condition 
of this, States would be required to evaluate these services and would 
need to either modify the service (and reevaluate the modified service) 
or cease using title IV-E funding for it if the evaluation shows the 
service to be ineffective. Combined, these proposals would further 
incentivize States to invest and scale up their IV-E prevention 
programs while giving States the flexibility to provide each child and 
family with the most appropriate and tailored services for their needs. 
The proposal also includes $10 million per year to enhance the 
operation of the Clearinghouse and to support timely evaluations and 
technical assistance on evaluations to develop additional evidence-
based programs. Finally, the proposal includes a change in the law to 
allow Tribes participating in the program through a State-Tribe title 
IV-E agreement to use interventions adapted to the culture and context 
of Tribal communities, exempting them from the requirement to use only 
programs rated as well supported, supported, or promising. (Currently, 
this flexibility is available only to Tribes operating the title IV-E 
Prevention Services program directly, rather than through a State-Tribe 
agreement.) The proposal would also specifically allow States to use 
cultural adaptations of interventions that have been rated by the 
clearinghouse as promising, supported, or well-supported.

                                 ______
                                 
            Questions Submitted by Hon. Robert P. Casey, Jr.
    Question. The Health and Human Services FY 2024 Budget in Brief 
includes a proposal to ``revise the special focus facility program'' in 
the section on Survey and Certification. Can you detail how the special 
focus facility program will be revised? Please include a breakdown of 
how the Survey and Certification funding, including the proposed 
increase, will address the special focus facility program.

    Answer. The President's Fiscal Year 2024 budget requests $566 
million for Survey and Certification, an increase of $159 million or 39 
percent above FY 2023 enacted. Twenty million of this request supports 
specific CMS actions outlined in the White House 2022 fact sheet aimed 
at improving safety and quality of care in the Nation's nursing homes. 
This includes addressing the backlog of complaints, revising the 
special focus facility program, and expanding financial penalties for 
poor-performing facilities.

    CMS's Special Focus Facility (SFF) program identifies the poorest-
performing nursing homes in the country for increased scrutiny in an 
effort to immediately improve the care they deliver. The SFF program 
currently requires more frequent compliance surveys for program 
participants, which must pass two consecutive inspections to 
``graduate'' from the program. As noted in the White House Fact Sheet, 
Protecting Seniors by Improving Safety and Quality of Care in the 
Nation's Nursing Homes, the SFF program will be overhauled to more 
quickly improve care for the affected residents, including changes that 
will make its requirements tougher and more impactful. CMS will also 
make changes that allow the program to scrutinize more facilities, by 
moving facilities through the program more quickly. Facilities that 
fail to improve will face increasingly larger enforcement actions, 
including termination from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, when 
appropriate. Additionally, on October 21, 2022, CMS released a SFF 
Program policy memo revising the SFF program to protect and improve the 
quality of care that residents living in these facilities receive. 
These changes aim to address facilities remaining in the SFF program 
for too long and facilities with ``yo-yo'' noncompliance after 
graduating. Additionally, because of the importance of nursing home 
staffing, CMS is informing State Survey Agencies to consider a 
facility's staffing levels data when selecting SFFs from the SFF 
candidate list.

    Question. In February, the United Cerebral Palsy and the American 
Network of Community Options and Resources (ANCOR) published a report 
entitled ``The Case for Inclusion'' that contained a number of alarming 
findings about the home-care workforce. The report documents families 
and individuals in need of these services being turned away by 
providers because they do not have sufficient staff. It also documents 
providers closing complete programs because of lack of staff. What 
efforts is HHS taking to both improve the recruitment and retention of 
workers providing home and community-based services?

    Answer. Within HHS, the Administration for Community Living (ACL)'s 
budget request for FY 2024 seeks to strengthen both. With respect to 
the paid direct-care workforce, HHS/ACL is currently funding the 
development of a Direct Care Workforce Center (https://acl.gov/news-
and-events/announcements/acl-launches-national-center-strengthen-
direct-care-workforce) through which State, private, and Federal 
entities involved in the recruitment, training and retention of direct-
care workers can access model policies, best practices, training 
materials, technical assistance, and learning collaboratives. Funding 
in FY 2024 will support continued operations of the Center and 
establish demonstration grants to develop partnerships across State 
aging, disability, Medicaid, and labor/workforce agencies and with 
aging, disability, labor and provider stakeholders to implement 
recruiting, retention, and training approaches to strengthen the 
direct-care workforce at State and local levels. The Direct Care 
Workforce Center is designed to catalyze change at a systems level that 
will address the insufficient supply of trained direct care workers, 
including Direct Support Professionals to assist individuals with 
disabilities to become and stay employed and live in the community, 
promote promising practices at all levels of the service system, and 
improve data collection to enable a full understanding of the workforce 
issue. The anticipated outcomes of this effort, include but are not 
limited to:

          Increasing the availability and visibility of tools and 
        resources to attract, train and retain the direct care 
        workforce in quality jobs where they earn livable wages and 
        have a voice in their working environment and have access to 
        benefits and opportunities for advancement; and
          Increasing the number of States that develop and sustain 
        collaborations across State systems and workforce agencies to 
        implement strategies that will improve the recruitment, 
        retention, and advancement of high-quality direct-care 
        workforce jobs.

    Question. Late last year, CMS proposed that Medicare cover seat 
elevation systems for people with disabilities. The final approval of 
this policy will mean better physical, emotional, and social 
development for thousands of people who have serious physical 
limitations. CMS has not, however started the process to cover standing 
systems for people with disabilities. Please provide us with an update 
on the process for considering and approving standing system coverage 
by Medicare.

    Answer. In February 2023 CMS published a proposed National Coverage 
Determination (NCD) to expand Medicare coverage for power seat 
elevation equipment for individuals with a Group 3 power wheelchair. 
The public comment period closed on this NCD last month. CMS plans to 
consider standing equipment in a separate future national coverage 
analysis. I'm happy to stay in touch with you as CMS undertakes this 
process.

    Question. I appreciate President Biden's focus on lowering drug 
costs for all Americans. As you know, Pennsylvania is home to a vital 
life sciences industry. It is important that we ensure that research 
and development remain strong, while reducing costs. How are you 
working to maintain the development of new therapeutics?

    Answer. The ecosystem in which FDA operates is rapidly evolving, 
with unprecedented scale and investment in drug (including biologics) 
development, increasing complexity in clinical trial designs, and 
expanding availability of drug development tools. To adapt to these 
rapid changes, the agency continues to modernize and enhance our core 
review processes to assure the safety and effectiveness of treatments 
are meeting the medical needs of the American public most effectively 
and efficiently. FDA is engaging with industry and other regulatory 
counterparts in meetings and workshops to share information about novel 
manufacturing approaches.

    FDA aims to grow the scientific expertise of agency staff and 
foster drug development and approval, particularly in areas of unmet 
medical need (e.g., disease areas that lack approved treatment 
options). Through scientific leadership we hope to:

          Develop strategic approaches to address substantive issues 
        in drug development, particularly in areas of unmet medical 
        need;
          Deepen review staff's scientific expertise and support 
        staff's professional development to continually enhance 
        efficient and effective regulatory decisions, informed by the 
        most current science in drug development; and
          Encourage the most efficient and effective drug development 
        approaches to support safe and effective therapeutic options 
        for patients, increase competition, and expand access.

    Question. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires 
Federal departments and agencies to ensure that information and 
communication technology is accessible for people with disabilities. 
Over the last year, I have used my position as chairman of the Aging 
Committee to examine compliance with this law, and assess the 
accessibility of Federal technology, including Federal websites, for 
people with disabilities, older adults, and veterans. In December 2022, 
I released ``Unlocking the Virtual Front Door,'' an investigation that 
found troubling examples of inaccessible technology across the Federal 
Government, and which issued 12 recommendations to improve 
accessibility. In February 2023, the Department of Justice (DOJ) 
responded to my calls for greater transparency of section 508 
compliance, releasing data that confirmed the findings of my report.

    I am concerned that people with disabilities are being locked out 
of government services and are not given a level playing field in 
Federal workplaces due to inaccessible technology at the Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS). According to data HHS submitted to 
DOJ, 90 percent of the 98,861 Internet webpages that were evaluated are 
compliant with section 508 accessibility requirements, while 71 percent 
of 1,430 intranet webpages that were evaluated are compliant. Moreover, 
25 years after section 508 was signed into law, HHS reported that two 
of its program areas--Compliance Process and Training--are not at the 
General Service Administration's (GSA) highest program maturity level. 
These data are consistent with the findings of my investigation, which 
identified examples of inaccessible technology at HHS and its agencies.

    Given these concerns, please answer the following question: how 
does HHS plan to improve section 508 compliance for its external 
websites, internal websites, and other electronic and information 
technology?

    Answer. HHS has undergone an extensive program maturity exercise 
within the last 3 years. Efforts included piloting new tools, 
processes, and accessibility services to improve acquisition, IT 
development, and web content conformance. The outcomes of these pilot 
projects have resulted in internal partnerships, and new services 
contract vehicle that extend digital accessibility resources throughout 
HHS. Operating Divisions and Staff Divisions can purchase services 
offered throughout the agency include options for accessibility tools, 
testing, remediation, web crawling and calibration, strategic planning, 
governance activities, section 508 program analytics and process 
improvements, virtual assistive technology lab, and assistive 
technology guidance.

    Question. Please explain the deficiencies in HHS's complaints 
process and training that are identified in the DOJ report. How and 
when does HHS plan to meet GSA's highest program maturity level for 
these accessibility programs?

    Answer. The HHS Digital Accessibility Program is in collaboration 
with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which owns the complaint 
process, to develop and publish guidance on submitting complaints and 
helpful steps to ensure conformance of content to avoid future 
complaints. The OCR process for filing a section 508 complaint is 
provided in the HHS Policy for section 508 Compliance and Accessibility 
of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) which is publicly 
posted on our website.

    Question. HHS reported evaluating 98,861 Internet webpages and 
1,430 intranet webpages, respectively. What percentage of HHS's total 
Internet and intranet webpages were evaluated?

    Answer. HHS takes a proactive approach to website conformance that 
validates webpages and content prior to posting online. Then utilizing 
scanning tools, section 508 programs can audit the content and process. 
The scans reported represent about 8 percent of the Internet webpages 
and .3 percent intranet webpages. The HHS Digital Accessibility Program 
is issuing a new services contract that increases the scanning and 
calibration of Internet and intranet pages. Once the new contract is in 
place, the program will begin routinely scanning and calibrating the 
scan results for all Operating Division homepages. In addition, the HHS 
Digital Accessibility Program will continue to provide an enterprise 
solution for Operating Divisions to scan Internet and intranet 
websites.

    Question. Please describe the existing pathways for employees and 
the public to file section 508 complaints with HHS at a departmental 
level, as well as at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Food and Drug 
Administration. Please provide the number of section 508 complaints HHS 
as a whole, and CDC, CMS and FDA on an agency level, have received for 
each of the last 5 fiscal years.

    Answer. Formal complaints must either be routed to the Office for 
Civil Rights (OCR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) office. It 
is up to the party filing the complaint to determine if an OpDiv-level 
or agency-wide entity will receive the submission. Upon request of an 
OCR or EEO entity, the respective section 508 program manager or 
designee will assist in the complaint process. Each OpDiv section 508 
program manager or designee is responsible for aiding in complaints 
pertaining to an OpDiv system, product, content, or service. Assistance 
may include gathering data, performing evaluations or providing 
guidance.

    Prior to a complaint being submitted, the nature of the complaint 
must be determined. The OCR investigates complaints related to civil 
rights, conscience, religious freedom, and health information privacy 
at covered entities under the follow authorities:

          Federal civil rights laws;
          Conscience and religious freedom laws;
          Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
        (HIPAA) Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules; and
          Patient Safety Act and Rules.

    Complaints can be filed on behalf of oneself, someone else, or an 
organization. OCR complaints must be filed using OCR's Complaint Portal 
Assistant. OCR's procedures will be followed and the applicable parties 
will be contacted if the complaint refers to an entity within an OpDiv.

    The EEO office processes complaints of employment discrimination 
based on disability. Federal employees and applicants for Federal 
employment who believe they have been subjected to discrimination must 
contact an EEO counselor within 45 calendar days of the alleged 
discriminatory action. EEO contact information can be located on the 
EEO Programs and Offices website. The complaint will then follow the 
EEO office's procedures until a determination is reached.

    There were four section 508-related complaints processed through 
OCR in the last year.

               Questions Submitted by Hon. Maggie Hassan
    Question. I have previously worked across the aisle to encourage 
the Department to issue a proposed rule on transitional coverage for 
emerging technologies (TCET) that addresses coverage for these 
technologies and balances access with patient protections.

    What is the Department's expected timeline for proposing and 
finalizing a new rule?

    Answer. CMS remains committed to expanding access to health-care 
coverage and services, including new, innovative treatments when they 
are safe and appropriate. CMS rescinded the Medicare Coverage of 
Innovative Technology and Definition of ``Reasonable and Necessary'' 
(MCIT/R&N) final rule because of concerns that the provisions in the 
final rule may not have been sufficient to protect Medicare patients. 
By rescinding this rule, CMS will take action to better address those 
safety concerns in the future.

    Improving and modernizing the Medicare coverage process continues 
to be a priority, and we remain committed to providing stakeholders 
with more transparent and predictable coverage pathways. CMS is working 
as quickly as possible to advance multiple coverage process 
improvements that provide an appropriate balance of access to new 
technologies with necessary patient protections. As part of this 
effort, CMS has conducted several listening sessions to learn about 
stakeholders' most pressing challenges and to receive feedback from 
stakeholders about which coverage process improvements would be most 
valuable.

    CMS intends to explore coverage process improvements that will 
enhance access to innovative and beneficial medical devices in a way 
that will better suit the health-care needs of people with Medicare. 
This will also help to establish a process in which the Medicare 
program covers new technologies on the basis of scientifically sound 
clinical evidence, with appropriate health and safety protections in 
place for the Medicare population. HHS looks forward to working with 
you and hearing your feedback as we move forward with these efforts.

    Question. Vaping among children and adolescents continues to be a 
major public health concern. I am particularly concerned about 
disposable vapes. In 2020, the FDA announced guidance concerning 
flavored vapes, but my understanding is that guidance has only applied 
to flavored vapes that use a refill cartridge, and not to flavored 
disposable vapes. As a result, disposable vapes have become vastly more 
popular, including among children using flavored disposable vapes, as 
shown in the 2022 National Youth Tobacco Survey. And it's clear that 
the companies manufacturing and marketing disposable vapes are using 
flavors, packaging, and tactics designed to appeal to children.

    What is the administration's plan for addressing this public health 
threat to our children? Will the FDA take steps to ensure that 
disposable flavored vapes are treated similarly to flavored vapes that 
use a refill cartridge?

    Answer. Thank you for the opportunity to address this issue. I can 
assure you that addressing youth use of electronic nicotine delivery 
systems (ENDS), including disposable e-cigarettes, is a top priority 
for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

    FDA takes a comprehensive approach to protecting our Nation's youth 
from the dangers of and access to tobacco products, including e-
cigarettes. Enforcement is an important component to FDA's multipronged 
approach to regulating tobacco products that also includes review of 
new products before they come to market, compliance and enforcement 
actions against illegal products, regulatory policy, and public 
education.

    As background, FDA has regulated e-cigarettes as tobacco products 
since August 8, 2016. Pursuant to the Tobacco Control Act, as of this 
date, e-cigarette products generally were required to have FDA 
authorization prior to marketing. For products that were already on the 
market when this requirement took effect, FDA deferred enforcement for 
a period of time. In January 2020, amid alarming levels of youth use of 
e-cigarettes, FDA issued a final guidance for industry outlining the 
agency's enforcement priorities for these products.

    The final guidance included a policy prioritizing enforcement 
against certain unauthorized flavored e-cigarette products that appeal 
to youth.\57\ At that time, cartridge-based products, including JUUL, 
were the most commonly reported product type used among U.S. youth. The 
guidance also noted that FDA intended to prioritize enforcement of any 
ENDS product that is offered for sale after September 9, 2020 and for 
which the manufacturer did not submit a premarket application (or after 
a negative action by FDA on a timely submitted application). 
Importantly, the guidance noted that it did not in any way alter the 
fact that it is illegal to market any new tobacco product without FDA 
authorization and that FDA may adjust its enforcement priorities over 
time in light of the best available data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \57\ This guidance was revised in April 2020 to reflect extensions 
of certain dates due to the COVID pandemic. This revised guidance is 
available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-
guidance-documents/enforcement-priorities-electronic-nicotine-delivery-
system-ends-and-other-deemed-products-market.

    In September 2020, based on data from the 2020 National Youth 
Tobacco Survey showing an alarming uptick in use of flavored disposable 
e-cigarettes by youth, FDA announced that it has taken action to notify 
companies selling such products to remove them from the market. In a 
press release, FDA stated: ``As we have said many times, the FDA will 
take action against any ENDS product--regardless of whether it is 
cartridge-based, disposable, flavored, or otherwise--if it is targeted 
to kids, if its marketing is likely to promote use by minors, or if the 
manufacturer fails to take adequate measures to prevent youth access,'' 
and ``This new data will inform the FDA's enforcement and other 
actions, and flavored disposable ENDS will be an enforcement priority 
for the agency.''\58\

    FDA has refused admission to the U.S. of disposable e-cigarettes 
for violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;\59\ issued 
warning letters to retailers for illegally selling disposable e-
cigarettes to underage purchasers; and issued warning letters to 
manufacturers for illegally marketing unauthorized disposable 
products--including Puff Bar,\60\ which was the most commonly used e-
cigarette brand reported by youth in 2022.

(PMTAs) for all new deemed tobacco products, including disposable e-
cigarettes. FDA issued marketing denial orders for certain disposable 
Hyde products, which was the third most commonly used e-cigarette brand 
among youth in 2022. Most recently, FDA also issued marketing denial 
orders (MDOs) to 10 companies, which collectively manufacture and 
market approximately 6,500 flavored e-liquid and e-cigarette 
products.\61\

    Question. On December 6, 2022, in my role as chair of the 
Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Spending Oversight of the Senate 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I sent a letter 
to HHS Acting Chief Financial Officer Norris Cochran and Chief 
Information Officer Karl Mathias regarding HHS's legacy information 
technology systems. The deadline to respond was February 6, 2023, but 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
my office has not received HHS's response.

    Please report on the status of the response and, if possible, 
attach it as part of your response to these questions for the record.

    Answer. Apologies for the delay. On April 18, 2023 HHS sent a 
response letter to your staff. It is attached here and summarized 
below.

    We appreciate Congress's continuing efforts to modernize and secure 
the information technology (IT) infrastructure across the government. 
HHS shares your goals to update and improve our aging legacy systems.

    HHS mainly uses the HHS Nonrecurring Expenses Fund (NEF) to meet 
the objectives of the Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017 
(MGT Act), rather than an agency specific working capital fund (WCF) 
for IT modernization. HHS uses the NEF for IT acquisition and 
modernization consistent with the MGT Act's objectives. HHS manages 
requests for IT resources through the NEF relying on the CIO and 
Assistant Secretary for Financial Resources (ASFR) as critical partners 
that ensure the uses of these funds support the agency mission. As part 
of an integrated process, the HHS CIO determines which IT projects are 
needed. The CIO review ensures critical projects receive funding before 
others are considered and that unapproved requests do not proceed. 
Next, ASFR determines whether the sponsoring office has alternative 
funding to cover the project and if central funding from the NEF is 
needed for the IT project to succeed. The combined process ensures the 
proper balance of funding sources and IT resources as they support the 
agency mission.

    The NEF authority provided by the Committees on Appropriations 
enables HHS to recycle funds that would otherwise not be available for 
IT investments, by allowing HHS to transfer funds to a central account, 
to remain available until expended for IT and facility investments. The 
HHS IT Strategic Plan FY 2021-2023 represents the Department's ambition 
to deliver its core functions with greater agility, security, and 
effectiveness amidst an evolving public health landscape. The HHS IT 
Strategic Plan may be found at: https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/
files/hhs-it-strategic-plan-final-fy2021-2023.pdf.

    Over the past 2 years, the Indian Health Service (IHS) has devoted 
substantial effort and resources to the program and acquisition 
planning phases of the agency's multi-year health information 
technology modernization initiative. Key elements accomplished or under 
way include:

          Tribal Consultation, Urban Confer, and internal agency 
        analysis of the findings from the 2018-2019 joint HHS/IHS 
        Health IT Modernization Research Project. A final decision memo 
        was issued in April of 2021 committing IHS to full replacement 
        of the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) as the 
        most appropriate, realistic, and sustainable option for IHS 
        health IT modernization.
          To accelerate planning and related activities, IHS engaged 
        the CMS Health Federally Funded Research and Development Center 
        (operated by the MITRE Corporation). MITRE has been working 
        with IHS for more than 2 years on multiple fronts, including:
          <ctr-circle>  Designing a Federal governance structure that 
ensures ongoing consultation and confer with Tribal and urban Indian 
partners as well as engagement of health IT users in building and 
operational management of the new systems.
          <ctr-circle>  Establishing the Federal Executive Steering 
Committee (ESC) and structuring the Program Management Office (PMO) 
responsible for overall day-to-day management of the modernization

              Questions Submitted by Hon. Elizabeth Warren
                          reproductive health
    Question. A Federal lawsuit is currently threatening access to 
mifepristone, one of two drugs used safely and effectively in 
medication abortion. Mifepristone has been FDA approved for over 2 
decades and is used in more than half of abortion procedures 
nationwide.

    Do you agree that FDA is best suited to determine the safety and 
effectiveness of drugs, including mifepristone?

    Answer. Yes. Congress has charged FDA with determining the safety 
and effectiveness of drugs. And I have confidence in the FDA staff, who 
rely on the best available scientific evidence to determine the safety 
and effectiveness of drugs, and I will continue to defend the FDA's 
independent, expert authority to review, approve, and regulate a wide 
range of prescription drugs.

    Question. Based on FDA's analysis, which includes review of 
information from multiple scientific and medical professional 
societies, do you agree that medication abortion is a safe option for 
patients to end an early pregnancy?

    Answer. The FDA approved Mifeprex (mifepristone 200 mg) more than 
20 years ago based on a thorough and comprehensive review of the 
scientific evidence presented and determined that it was safe and 
effective for medical termination of early pregnancy. Since 2016, it 
has been approved for medical termination of pregnancy through 70 days 
gestation. In this area, as in all others FDA regulates, the best 
available science has guided agency decision-making.

    Taking mifepristone off the market would significantly compromise 
access across the country--including in California, Illinois, New York, 
and other States that have secured abortion access.

    Question. What is HHS doing to protect access to medication 
abortion?

    Answer. The Biden-Harris administration is committed to protecting 
access to reproductive health care and has taken several steps to 
advance this work. Just hours after the Supreme Court's decision in 
Dobbs was released, the Department put up the website 
reproductiverights.gov to help ensure that people had a fact-based 
website with information on their rights and where they can get 
coverage for family planning care and birth control. And, based on a 
comprehensive review of the Mifepristone Risk Evaluation and Mitigation 
Strategy (REMS) Program, in January 2023 the FDA approved modifications 
to the REMS so that Mifepristone is no longer required to be dispensed 
in-person. In addition, the FDA eliminated the previous REMS 
requirement that did not allow the drug to be dispensed by retail 
pharmacies; under the REMS, any pharmacy that meets the requirements, 
and is certified, may dispense mifepristone based on a prescription 
from a certified prescriber. Protecting access to safe and effective 
medication abortion is a top priority for me.

    Medicaid's free choice of provider requirement is a critical 
protection that ensures Medicaid beneficiaries can access sexual and 
reproductive health care at the provider of their choice, including 
Planned Parenthood. As you know, we have witnessed a disturbing trend 
in recent years, as hostile Republican Governors and State legislatures 
have taken action to deny Medicaid patients their Federal legal right 
to seek services from the provider of their choice. Several States--
Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana, and South Carolina--
have violated this longstanding requirement. These State violations 
delay and impede timely access to essential services: birth control, 
sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, gender-affirming 
care, annual wellness exams, and other essential care. These violations 
also disproportionately impact people and women of color, who, due to 
racism and other systemic barriers that have contributed to income 
inequality, are more likely to use Medicaid for coverage.

    I recently sent a letter highlighting a number of important steps 
to protect access to reproductive health care, including enforcement of 
this critical Federal protection, as part of the ongoing response to 
the Supreme Court's devastating decision in Dobbs.

    Question. What is HHS's plan to protect everyone's right to access 
services like birth control, STI testing and treatment, and gender-
affirming care at the provider of their choice?

    Answer. The Biden-Harris administration is committed to ensuring 
access to health care and has taken several steps to advance this work. 
Just hours after the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs was released, 
the Department published the website reproductiverights.gov to help 
ensure that people had a fact-based website with information about 
their rights and where they can obtain coverage for family planning 
care and birth control. The Department also worked to help ensure that 
people could continue to access birth control through private insurance 
markets and other Federal programs. Additionally, on July 13, 2022, HHS 
issued guidance to roughly 60,000 U.S. retail pharmacies, reminding 
them of their obligations under Federal civil rights laws. This issue 
is a top priority for me, and one I have tasked the entire Department 
with taking immediate action to address.
                           organ procurement
    Question. Last week HHS announced transformative reforms to break 
up UNOS's fatal monopoly over the United States organ procurement and 
transplantation network (OPTN) through HRSA's Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Modernization Initiative. OPTN failures also resulted 
from severe and undisclosed conflicts among organ donation industry 
stakeholders who served on OPTN boards and committees.

    What specific steps will HHS (including CMS and HRSA) take to 
ensure that, going forward, any stakeholder serving in any board, 
advisory, or other capacity in OPTN or Scientific Registry of 
Transplant Recipients policymaking or oversight fully discloses all 
financial conflicts of interest, including but not limited to financial 
relationships with the OPTN, OPOs, tissue recovery and processing 
companies, organ logistics and transportation companies, or any other 
organization which does business related to organ donation or 
transplantation?

    Answer. The Organ Procurement Transplantation Network (OPTN) 
develops and implements policies approved by the OPTN board of 
directors. On March 22, 2023, HHS announced a multiyear OPTN 
modernization initiative designed to improve effectiveness across the 
organ donation, procurement, and transplantation system. The 
President's budget for Fiscal Year 2024 would more than double HRSA's 
budget for organ-related work, including OPTN contracting and the 
implementation of the modernization initiative, to total $67 million. 
The initiative is intended to strengthen accountability, equity, and 
performance in the organ donation and transplantation system through a 
focus on five key areas with the following goals:

          Technology--ensure that the system is reliable, secure, 
        patient-centered, user-friendly, and reflective of modern 
        technology functionality. There is a continuous focus on 
        improved IT system functionality and security, while ensuring 
        continuity of services, protecting patient safety, and 
        accelerating innovation in line with industry-leading 
        standards.
          Data Transparency and Analytics--ensure data is accessible, 
        user-friendly, and patient-oriented. The modernization process 
        provides easily accessible, high-quality, and timely data to 
        make informed patient, donor, and clinical decisions; measure 
        and evaluate program performance; inform oversight and 
        compliance activities; and support the advancement of 
        scientific research.
          Governance--the OPTN board of directors is high-functioning 
        and has greater independence; represents the diversity of 
        communities; and delivers effective policy development.
          Operations--the OPTN is effective and accountable in its 
        implementation of organ policy, patient safety and compliance 
        monitoring, organ transport, OPTN member support, and education 
        of patients, families, and the public.
          Quality Improvement and Innovation--the OPTN promotes a 
        culture of quality improvement and innovation across the 
        network by leveraging timely data and performance feedback, 
        collaborative learning, and strategic partnerships.

    The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has been 
working to make improvements with these goals in mind. In July 2022, 
the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients convened a consensus 
conference to make recommendations for better metrics to support organ 
donation and transplantation and in March 2023, HRSA released an OPTN 
organ transplantation dashboard to improve transparency of data to the 
public. Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 OPTN contract solicitations are an 
opportunity for further advancements in transparency, such as a 
requirement of the OPTN contractor to improve patient and family 
understanding of waitlist practices.

    As part of the modernization initiative, HRSA will continue to 
strengthen OPTN contract requirements to ensure members of the OPTN 
board of directors are separate from OPTN contractor's board. Further, 
the Fall 2023 OPTN contract solicitation will enable multiple vendors 
to compete for distinct OPTN functions and will require establishment 
of an independent OPTN board of directors free from conflicts of 
interest.

    HRSA requires the OPTN board of directors and the Scientific 
Registry of Transplant Recipients Review Committee members to complete 
training and sign annual attestations to mitigate conflict of interest 
concerns and ensure that financial relationships are disclosed.

    HRSA will continue to focus on meeting the needs of patients and 
families by strengthening and providing equitable access to 
transplantation, improving safety and health outcomes, and empowering 
patients and providers with the data needed to make informed, shared 
decisions.

    To ensure fair and open competition for the OPTN contract, it is 
imperative that HHS not allow UNOS or its surrogates to interfere with 
the business and operations of other potentially interested bidders, 
including through retaliation or harassment against patients, doctors, 
caregivers, or other stakeholders interested in supporting competitive 
bids.

    Question. What specific steps will HHS commit to taking to 
investigate any and all such allegations, and to remove from all OPTN 
activities anyone found to be involved in such retaliation and 
harassment?

    How will HHS/HRSA ensure that taxpayer resources--including those 
that have accumulated at UNOS due to both HRSA appropriations as well 
as OPTN and UNOS fees, which were funded by taxpayers via Medicare as 
well as other parts of government--are not used to fund either UNOS's 
bid for component pieces of the OPTN contract, acquisition of any 
potential competitors, or its extensive marketing and lobbying 
activities?

    Answer. In the upcoming Request for Proposals (RFP), HHS, through 
HRSA, will follow all Federal contract policies to ensure that there is 
equal opportunity for eligible vendors. HRSA also is committed to 
accountability and intends to work closely with the HHS Office of the 
Inspector General and others in response to any allegations that 
warrant such action.
                               child care
    Question. Early education expands learning opportunities for our 
babies and gives parents an opportunity to go to work. But the United 
States has been underinvesting in child care for decades. Of the 37 
richest nations in the world, the U.S. is now number 33 in our spending 
on our little ones.\62\

    Yet, House Republicans are demanding across-the-board funding 
cuts--at least 27 percent to all government programs.\63\ If defense, 
veterans, Social Security, and Medicare are off the table--as some 
Republicans now claim--other programs would need to be cut by 78 
percent.\64\ That includes funding for Head Start and other crucial 
child-care programs.

levels for Head Start would result in a loss of at least 170,000 slots 
for children, and a 22-percent reduction in funding from FY 2023 would 
eliminate over 200,000 slots.\65\ How many slots would be lost if Head 
Start funding were cut by 27 percent? 78 percent?

    Answer. Reducing funding for Head Start by 27 percent would 
eliminate nearly 250,000 slots for children. A 78-percent cut would 
result in a loss of more than 600,000 slots. With a 78-percent cut, OHS 
would expect that many programs--particularly Tribal, rural, and 
smaller programs--would need to close because their programs would no 
longer be viable due to very small size and they would no longer be 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
able to cover fixed operating costs such as rent.

    Question. You have also stated that a return to FY 2022 enacted 
funding levels would result in a loss of at least 105,000 child-care 
slots, down from 1,843,000 in FY 2023.\66\ And a 22-percent reduction 
in funding from FY 2023 would eliminate over 101,000 slots.\67\ How 
many slots would be lost if child-care funding were cut by 27 percent? 
78 percent?

    What would the impacts of these funding cuts mean for parents, 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
families, and children losing access to care?

    Answer. Even with the 30-percent increase Congress appropriated to 
the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) in FY 2023, the 
child-care subsidy system is only funded to serve a small fraction of 
eligible families to be served--historically supporting just one in 
seven of those children who are eligible for child-care assistance. 
Future funding cuts to CCDBG would result in States reducing the number 
of families who receive child-care assistance. Funding cuts will also 
undermine parent choice in care, making it even more difficult for 
parents to find child care that meets their family's needs. Reducing 
child-care assistance will also harm employment and family economic 
stability. In some areas of the country, child-care costs can exceed 
the cost of college tuition.\68\ When families are unable to access 
child-care subsidies, they may have to patch together less expensive 
care that could lead to informal, unregulated care that is less 
reliable, less likely to meet children's developmental needs and to 
families cutting work hours or exiting the workforce entirely. It's 
estimated that U.S. parents collectively lose $30 to $35 billion in 
income due to reducing their work or leaving the workforce entirely 
when they cannot find affordable child care.\69\

    Question. The Child Care Stabilization Grants provided in the 
American Rescue Plan Act (Pub. L. 117-2) provided crucial relief during 
the COVID-19 pandemic to allow child-care centers to remain open. 
However, the expiration of this funding is rapidly approaching, with 
States facing a funding cliff of over $48 billion.\70\ How will the end 
of this relief funding, coupled with proposed cuts to annual child-care 
funding affect the child-care industry? What would the impact be on the 
child-care workforce, which is still down about 60,000 workers compared 
to pre-pandemic?\71\ How many families would lose access to child care? 
What would the impact be on fees and affordability?

    Answer. ARP and other COVID child-care funding has been critical to 
stabilizing the child-care sector, lowering parent costs, and raising 
child-care staff compensation. The end of these funds coupled with 
additional cuts to the CCDF program will harm many children and 
families. Child-care programs need consistent revenue and financial 
support to be able to improve quality or raise chronically low wages 
for the child-care workforce to address high employee turnover and 
staff shortages. Some States have used ARP funds to pay bonuses or 
increase salaries, but providers say they still struggle to find staff, 
and it is uncertain whether these practices will be continued after ARP 
stabilization funds expire. Due to the staffing shortages, there are 
providers currently reporting they are hiring people who they would not 
have even considered for a position prior to the COVID-19 pandemic 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
because of lack of skill, training, or competence.

    Additionally, families will lose access to subsidies just as ARP 
stabilization payments are no longer available to support child-care 
providers directly. A Kentucky child-care provider recently shared what 
this means for her business and the families she serves. Before the 
COVID-19 pandemic, she served two to five children who received a 
child-care subsidy. Currently, 19 children in her program receive a 
subsidy, but only for the remainder of this eligibility year. Once ARP 
stabilization payments to providers expire, the provider expects she 
will need to raise tuition up to 70 percent to remain open and keep 
staff. This means the cost to families will increase just as they are 
losing access to subsidies.
                              drug pricing
    Question. After more than 480 days, the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) responded to the petition sent to you by prostate cancer 
patients Robert Sachs and Clare Love, formally asking HHS to grant 
march-in rights for the patents on the prostate cancer drug 
enzalutamide (marketed as Xtandi). The patients' petition referenced a 
previous request to the Department of Defense (DOD) for it to use 
march-in rights, as well as the nonexclusive, nontransferable, 
irrevocable, paid-up licenses held by the U.S. Government to use the 
enzalutamide patents, to which the DOD never responded.

    The response from the NIH to the petition sent to you completely 
ignored the petitioners' argument that, by definition, meeting 
practical application requirements under the Bayh-Dole Act requires 
that the invention at issue is ``available to the public on reasonable 
terms.'' I object to HHS, through NIH, continuing to ignore this vital 
taxpayer protection.

    While it is my strongly held view that a prescription drug 
corporation charging U.S. patients and taxpayers 3-6 times the prices 
it charges in other wealthy countries for a drug that U.S. taxpayers 
paid to invent through grants from the NIH constitutes sufficient 
grounds for exercising march-in rights, the royalty-free right, 
provided under 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(4), is not subject to practical 
application or other march-in rights prerequisites. Additionally, the 
royalty-free right is not subject to appeal before the United States 
Court of Federal Claims or to being held in abeyance during such an 
appeal.

    Currently, four companies have filed ANDA applications, two of 
which have already received tentative approval from FDA for generic 
versions of enzalutamide. Through HHS exercising its royalty-free 
rights, these manufacturers could readily supply Federal health 
programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, for a fraction of the price 
charged by Astellas, saving taxpayers billions of dollars over the 
remaining patent life of enzalutamide.

    Has your office considered exercising the royalty-free rights held 
by HHS for enzalutamide? If so, what determinations have you made and 
under what rationale? If not, why not?

    Answer. I assure you that HHS and the Biden-Harris administration 
remain steadfastly committed to increasing all Americans' access to 
health care and lowering costs for lifesaving treatments and cures.

    In support of President Biden's Executive Order on Lowering 
Prescription Drug Costs for Americans (https://www.whitehouse.gov/
briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/10/14/executive-order-on-
lowering-prescription-drug-costs-for-americans/), HHS is pursuing a 
whole-of-government approach to build on this administration's 
priorities. As you noted, an important step towards this goal was the 
passage and signing of the Inflation Reduction Act, which will reduce 
prescription drug costs for the more than 63 million individuals with 
Medicare. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
recently issued initial guidance detailing the requirements and 
procedures for implementing the new Medicare Drug Price Negotiation 
Program for the first set of negotiations. The first set of 
negotiations will occur during 2023 and 2024 and result in prices 
effective in 2026. The guidance details how Medicare intends to use its 
new authority to effectively negotiate with drug companies for lower 
prices on selected high-expenditure drugs, and illustrates the Biden-
Harris administration's commitment to lowering high prescription drug 
costs and improving access to innovative therapies. CMS anticipates 
issuing revised guidance for the first year of negotiation in Summer 
2023.

    We know more must be done as too many Americans, particularly the 
uninsured, find these therapies to be out of reach. March-in authority 
is indeed a powerful tool designed to ensure that the benefits of the 
American taxpayer's investment in research and development are 
reasonably accessible to the public. HHS, the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH), and other agencies have been petitioned on several 
occasions to initiate march-in proceedings, but to date have not 
invoked this authority. Most recently, NIH declined to initiate a 
march-in proceeding, at the petition of a third party, for the prostate 
cancer drug Xtandi. In the case of Xtandi, NIH thoroughly reviewed the 
petition in a manner consistent with the policy and objectives of the 
Bayh-Dole Act, including an assessment of the relevant intellectual 
property and applicability of the four statutory criteria. NIH's 
analyses found Xtandi to be widely available to the public on the 
market. In addition, given the remaining patent life and the lengthy 
administrative process involved for a march-in proceeding, NIH did not 
believe that use of the march-in authority would be an effective means 
of lowering the price of the drug. For these reasons, NIH determined 
that initiation of a march-in proceeding was not warranted in this case 
and HHS concurs with NIH's decision. This decision is consistent with 
NIH's determination in 2016 in which Knowledge Ecology International 
and the Union for Affordable Cancer Treatment requested that NIH and 
the Department of Defense initiate march-in proceedings based on the 
price of Xtandi, but each declined.

    We recognize, however, that there is a need to evaluate how pricing 
may be a contributing factor when weighing the use of the march-in 
authority and have committed to working with the Department of Commerce 
to review the use of march-in authority as laid out in the Bayh-Dole 
Act. Through this partnership, we have asked an Interagency Working 
Group to develop a framework for consistent implementation of the 
march-in provision across the U.S. Government that clearly articulates 
guiding criteria and processes for making determinations where 
different factors, including price, may be a consideration in agencies' 
assessments. HHS will convene a workshop in 2023 to further refine the 
cases for which HHS could consider exercising march-in authority. HHS 
will seek input from a diverse array of stakeholders--including patient 
groups, industry, universities, small business firms, and nonprofit 
organizations, as well as experts in technology transfer and innovation 
policy. The goal of the workshop will be to assess when the use of 
march-in rights is consistent with the policy and objectives of the 
Bayh-Dole Act.
                       unique device identifiers
    Question. Although medical device failures are rare, when they do 
occur, they can create serious health problems and significant 
financial costs. A 2017 investigation by the Office of Inspector 
General at the Department of Health and Human Services found that 
recalls or premature failures of just seven faulty cardiac devices 
resulted in $1.5 billion in Medicare payments and $140 million in out-
of-pocket costs to beneficiaries. Furthermore, the Inspector General 
was not able to examine the total cost of all device failures because 
of the lack of information about specific devices in claims data. 
Instead, OIG examiners were forced to engage in a ``complex and labor-
intensive audit'' to assess the impact of the seven faulty devices. As 
a result, the OIG recommended that CMS add unique device identifiers 
(UDIs) to Medicare claims. Including device identifiers on claims 
transactions would greatly improve the health system's ability to 
identify risks and reach patients who may be affected by device 
failures.

    The process of adding UDIs to Medicare claims is a complex one, but 
ultimately will require CMS to agree to act on the recommendations of 
X12, an entity that establishes accredited standards for claims 
transactions. In June, X12 formally recommended that the device 
identifier portion of a medical device's UDI be included on the 
electronic claims transaction. Now, the National Committee on Vital and 
Health Statistics, an HHS advisory body, must assess the recommendation 
and make an official recommendation to HHS for adoption.

    Will you commit to implementing X12's recommendation and adding 
UDIs to Medicare claims in a timely manner?

    Answer. While the benefits of UDI adoption in health care are well 
known, as you noted, for any portion of the UDI to be included in 
Medicare claims, the American National Standard Institute's Accredited 
Standards Committee (X12) must first submit formal recommendations on 
the proposed health-care claims transaction standards to the National 
Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS). NCVHS must then, 
after assessing the recommendations, officially recommend to the 
Department that it should adopt the standards. Finally, the 
Department's adoption of new standards would still have to be completed 
through notice and comment rulemaking. The X12 committee has made 
recommendations to include collection of the DI for high-risk 
implantable devices, between willing trading partners, in the next 
version of the claim transactions standards. The Department will have 
the opportunity to address this issue after we receive the NCVHS 
recommendations for the next version of the standard transactions.

               Questions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley
    Question. Value-based health-care efforts are important to bending 
the cost curve of our Nation's health-care spending. In 2019, CBO 
stated ``the available evidence indicates that ACOs have had little or 
no net effect on Medicare spending.'' Since then, CBO has communicated 
they monitor ``official evaluations of ACOs from the Center for 
Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) as well as academic research 
about the performance of ACOs. Since the agency's statement in March 
2019 and December 2020 QFRs, CBO's review of the evidence continues to 
indicate that ACOs have had little or no net effect on Medicare 
spending.'' What is the Office of the Actuary at CMS's independent 
actuarially sound estimate for combined Medicare and Medicaid 
unrealized savings to the Federal Government from ACOs since the ACA 
was implemented? Does the administration assume any of the actuarially 
sound estimate into its mandatory health spending outlays?

    Answer. The Medicare Shared Savings Program, through its work with 
Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) saved Medicare $1.66 billion in 
2021 compared to spending targets. This marks the 5th consecutive year 
the program has generated overall savings and high-quality performance 
results. Over the past decade, the Shared Savings Program has grown to 
one of the largest value-based purchasing programs in the country. 
Other ACO models in the Innovation Center have also been found to 
produce Medicare savings. In particular, the Pioneer ACO Model, which 
operated from 2012 through 2016, was evaluated to have saved $384 
million over the first 2 performance years ($254 million in net 
savings) and was certified for expansion by the Chief Actuary of CMS in 
2015 because expansion was expected to reduce net Medicare spending. In 
that certification, the Chief Actuary noted that ``[b]oth the Pioneer 
and MSSP ACOs have been shown to produce savings relative to fee-for-
service Medicare.'' In addition, the ACO Investment Model, which 
operated from 2015 through 2018, was evaluated to have saved $526.4 
million in Medicare spending across 3 performance years ($381.5 million 
in net savings). Elements of both models were subsequently incorporated 
into the Shared Savings Program through rulemaking. Based on these 
successes and opportunities to continually improve value for people 
with Medicare and the health-care system, CMS has set a goal that 100 
percent of people with traditional Medicare will be part of an 
accountable care relationship by 2030.

Savings Program is publicly available at https://www.cms.gov/medicare/

    Question. The President's budget seeks to permanently extend 
enhanced premium tax credits for high-income earners beyond 2025. The 
budget proposal indicates permanently extending enhanced premium tax 
credits costs $183 billion over 10 years. CBO has estimated making the 
subsidies permanent would result in a 2.3 million decrease in 
enrollment in employment-based coverage. What actions is the 
administration taking to expand other high-quality, consumer-protected 
affordable health-care options, including employer-based coverage 
options, that do not cost the taxpayers anywhere near $183 billion over 
10 years?

    Answer. Ensuring that all Americans have access to quality, 
affordable health care is one of the Biden-Harris administration's top 
priorities, and HHS has numerous efforts underway to help achieve this 
goal. The enhanced premium tax credits contributed to a record-setting 
16.3 million people enrolling in marketplace coverage in 2023. The 
President's budget also lowers costs for families with private health 
coverage by capping insulin costs at $35 for a monthly prescription and 
extending Medicare drug inflation rebates to commercial plans. In 
December 2022, CMS released the 2024 Notice of Benefit and Payment 
Parameters Proposed Rule, which would increase access to health-care 
services, simplify choice and improve the plan selection process, and 
make it easier for consumers to enroll in coverage. As required by law, 
CMS sought public comment on the proposed rule and will take this 
feedback into account when finalizing the Notice of Benefit and Payment 
Parameters. CMS received a large number of comments in response to the 
proposed rule and appreciates the commenters' thoughts and input 
regarding standards for issuers and marketplaces, as well as 
requirements for agents, brokers, web-brokers, and assisters that help 
consumers with enrollment through marketplaces that use the Federal 
platform.

    Question. In February, CMS finalized the Medicare Advantage Risk 
Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) rule with the goal ``to improve 
program integrity and payment accuracy.'' I've written to CMS in 2015 
and 2017 asking what they are doing to implement safeguards to reduce 
risk score fraud, waste, and abuse. In the final rule, CMS plans to 
only attempt to collect $41.1 million in non-extrapolated improper 
payments from 2011 to 2017, instead of approximately $2 billion in 
extrapolated improper payments over the same time period. In explaining 
this decision, CMS cited ``certain operational considerations.''

    Please provide a detailed list of those ``certain operational 
considerations'' and their associated costs to the Federal Government 
to perform.

    In 2015, CMS noted to me that it recovered $1.5 billion from 2006 
to 2013 in ``report and pay'' recoveries from Medicare Advantage 
organizations. The proposed RADV rule stated it would collect $4.5 
billion over 10 years. Your agency's final rule goes into great detail 
about the repeated delay of RADV audits. Your agency estimates in its 
final rule that it will collect $4.7 billion in overpayments over a 10-
year period. Given the agency's track record on RADV overpayment 
auditing and the delay of this final rule, what assurances can the 
agency provide that it will meet the estimates for collections in the 
next 10 years?

    CMS has previously stated to me that its RADV audit process for 
each calendar year was at various stages of review and completion. 
Please provide a status update and expected timeline for Medicare 
Advantage overpayment audits by calendar year from 2011 through 2022.

    Answer. On February 1st, CMS published a final rule that finalized 
the policies for the Medicare Advantage (MA) Risk Adjustment Data 
Validation (RADV) program, which is CMS's primary audit and oversight 
tool of MA program payments. In addition to the CMS RADV audits, the 
HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) also undertakes audits of 
MAOs, similar to RADV audits, as part of its oversight functions. CMS 
can collect the improper payments identified during those HHS-OIG 
audits, including the extrapolated amounts calculated by the HHS-OIG.

    The policies in the RADV final rule will help protect the Medicare 
Advantage program by addressing instances where Medicare paid Medicare 
Advantage Organizations (MAOs) more than they otherwise should have 
received because the medical diagnoses submitted for risk adjustment 
payment were not supported in the beneficiary's medical record. 
Specifically, this final rule codifies in regulation that, as part of 
the RADV audit methodology, CMS will extrapolate RADV audit findings 
beginning with payment year (PY) 2018. As a result, CMS will only 
collect the non-extrapolated overpayments identified in the CMS RADV 
audits and HHS-OIG audits between PY 2011 and PY 2017, and will begin 
the collection of extrapolated overpayment findings for any CMS and 
HHS-OIG audits conducted in PY 2018 and any subsequent payment year.

    We believe this is an appropriate policy because it recognizes our 
fiduciary duty to protect taxpayer dollars from overpayments and 
preserves our ability to collect on potentially significant amounts of 
overpayments made to plans beginning in PY 2018 using an extrapolation 
methodology. This final rule will also allow CMS to focus on conducting 
future RADV audits as soon as practicable after an MAO payment year 
concludes, which was the topic of significant public comment to the 
proposed rule. Lastly, we have determined that it is in the best 
interest of all parties to ensure that the contract-level RADV appeals 
process, which is also referenced in regulation, is able to 
successfully process all RADV appeals. By not using an extrapolation 
methodology prior to PY 2018, we expect to better control the total 
number of active appeals that are submitted in the first few years 
following finalization of this rule, which will alleviate burden on 
MAOs and CMS.

    When this rule is finalized, we will begin issuing the enrollee-
level audit findings from the CMS RADV audits that have been completed 
(that is, CMS RADV audits for PY 2011-2013, followed eventually by PY 
2014 and PY 2015 audits), as well as recovering enrollee-level improper 
payments identified in HHS-OIG completed RADV audits. The plans for 
future audit years will be communicated to the MAOs through our 
standard channels.

    Question. HHS recently posted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that 
would allow States to maintain different standards to license non-
relative foster parents and kinship care providers, with the goal of 
reducing barriers for relatives to provide care to children who are in 
need of foster care. Will ACF issue guidance to States on how decisions 
related to non-safety related standards for kinship providers could 
also be applied to non-relative foster parents to reduce barriers to 
licensing?

    Answer. While title IV-E of the act specifically allows title IV-E 
agencies to waive non-safety licensing standards for relative foster 
family homes (see section 471(a)(10)(D) of the act), there is no 
similar waiver for non-related foster family homes. Therefore, ACF 
cannot provide guidance on how to waive those standards for non-related 
foster family homes. Subject to the requirements for title IV-E 
eligibility, State licensing standards for foster homes, whether 
related or non-related homes, are generally a State issue. ACF is happy 
to work with States that are interested in exploring potential changes 
to their State licensing standards to reduce barriers to licensing, but 
ACF does not generally oversee State licensing standards.

    Question. HHS recently posted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that 
would allow States to maintain different standards to license non-
relative foster parents and kinship care providers, with the goal of 
reducing barriers for relatives to provide care to children who are in 
need of foster care. The definition of kinship provider can include 
non-relatives who have an existing connection to a child. For the 
purpose of this rulemaking, how will ACF instruct States to consider 
licensing for relatives compared to non-relative, ``fictive kin?''

    Answer. As stated in the February 2023 NPRM, title IV-E agencies 
have discretion to define ``relative'' and ``kin'' when determining to 
whom they will apply the relative licensing and approval standards. ACF 
is currently reviewing and analyzing public comments on the Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking. The Department has not yet determined how the 
final rule will respond to the committee's question.

    Question. The Fiscal Year 2024 budget request includes a request to 
make permanent a temporary provision allowing 50 percent of States' 
spending on prevention services under the Family First Prevention 
Services Act to be spent on programs that are rated as well-supported 
or supported, rather than only well-supported programs. This temporary 
provision was enacted in 2019 when the Prevention Services 
Clearinghouse was newly created and there was an extremely limited 
number of well-supported programs. In your view, how many well-
supported programs would need to be listed on the Prevention Services 
Clearinghouse to return to the original requirement of the Family First 
Prevention Services Act? Is HHS concerned that supported programs may 
not be as effective in accomplishing the goals of preventing foster 
care placement and ensuring child safety and well-being compared to 
well-supported programs?

    Answer. The title IV-E Prevention Services Program, created by the 
Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA), provides a watershed 
opportunity to create more equitable and positive outcomes for 
children, youth, and families before they face the tumult and 
devastating consequences of maltreatment and separation. Working with 
State and Tribal partners, we are seeking to expand participation in 
the program and to ensure that agencies are able to offer effective 
services to meet the needs of all communities and families and we are 
making progress:

          To date, the Prevention Services Clearinghouse has reviewed 
        141 programs and services; 17 of these have been rated as well-
        supported, 18 of these have been rated as supported, and 36 of 
        these have been rated as promising.
          The 42 approved State, jurisdiction, and Tribal title IV-E 
        prevention program plans to date have identified 13 well-
        supported, 5 supported, and 5 promising evidence-based programs 
        (EBPs) and services for reimbursement in the delivery of 
        prevention services.

    It is difficult to determine how many well-supported programs are 
necessary to address and serve the breadth of issues that children and 
families present when coming into contact with State child welfare 
systems. We know from State child welfare agencies that families are 
bringing high level, complex service needs that often require a more 
tailored approach to effectively serving each family. Programs and 
services that carry a promising or supported rating are required to 
undergo ongoing evaluation in an effort to increase their level of 
evidence to support a well-supported rating. At this time, we believe 
it is in the best interest of children and families to provide as wide 
a range of evidence-based/informed services as possible and to 
capitalize on all available levers for building evidence.

    Question. HHS and the Department of Agriculture have now twice 
failed to follow the recommendations of a 2017 report from the National 
Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), requested by 
Congress to evaluate the Dietary Guidelines for Americans development 
process--which explicitly recommended releasing ``any known conflicts--
for a reasonable period of time prior to appointment.'' It is troubling 
that this recommendation was not implemented in the last two advisory 
committee selection processes, not to mention the failure to implement 
several other NASEM recommended reforms designed to bolster 
transparency.

    Will you commit to making any known conflicts of interest reviewed 
during the selection process public?

    In the past, the departments cited privacy concerns for potential 
nominees to justify their decision not to publicly disclose any known 
conflicts. If the departments continue to refuse to make public this 
information, do the departments plan to develop an alternative method 
for disclosing committee members' conflicts of interest following 
appointment?

    Answer. HHS and USDA have developed procedures to ensure that the

    Question. As I stated in my opening comments at the hearing, I 
thank you for enabling transitional health plans to continue. 
Approximately 65,000 Iowans are benefiting from this action with many 
being farmers and small business owners. Letting transitional health 
plans continue has been a bipartisan priority under Presidents Obama, 
Trump, and now Biden. The March 23, 2022, bulletin from CMS permitted 
the nonenforcement policy for CY 2023 and it states the nonenforcement 
``will remain in effect until CMS announces that all such coverage must 
come into compliance with the specified requirements.'' While the 
nonenforcement creates regulatory certainty in CY 2023, it actually 
creates uncertainty in CY 2024 and subsequent years. Your answer on 
this topic to my FY 2023 Health and Human Services budget question for 
the record stated, ``On March 23, 2022, CMS issued a bulletin that 
extends the policy under which CMS will not take enforcement action 
against certain non-grandfathered health insurance coverage in the 
individual and small group market that is out of compliance with 
certain specified market reforms. The extended nonenforcement policy 
applies for policy years beginning after October 1, 2022, and will 
remain in effect until CMS announces that all such coverage must come 
into compliance with the specified requirements.'' Given you didn't 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
answer my questions in 2022, I will restate my questions below.

    What standard will CMS apply in taking regulatory action to permit 
transitional health plans to be sold in CY 2024 and subsequent years?

    What policymaking process will CMS have in taking regulatory action 
to permit transitional health plans to be sold in CY 2024 and into the 
future?

    Answer. On March 23, 2022, CMS issued a bulletin that extends the 
policy under which CMS will not take enforcement action against certain 
non-grandfathered health insurance coverage in the individual and small 
group market that is out of compliance with certain specified market 
reforms. The extended nonenforcement policy applies for policy years 
beginning after October 1, 2022, and will remain in effect until CMS 
announces that all such coverage must come into compliance with the 
specified requirements.

    Question. As of March 11, 2023, according to the Rural Health 
Redesign Center that is serving as the Rural Emergency Hospital 
Technical Assistance Center, more than 50 hospitals and other 
organizations have expressed interest in becoming a Rural Emergency 
Hospital (REH), a new voluntary Medicare designation that provides a 
lifeline to ensure access to rural health-care services. How many 
applications has HHS/CMS received from hospitals expressing intent on 
becoming an REH? How many applications have been approved by HHS/CMS?

    Answer. Rural Emergency Hospitals (REHs) are a new provider type 
established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 to address the 
growing concern over closures of rural hospitals. The REH designation 
provides an opportunity for Critical Access Hospitals and certain rural 
hospitals to avert potential closure and continue to provide essential 
services for the communities they serve. Conversion to an REH allows 
for the provision of emergency services, observation care, and 
additional medical and health outpatient services, if elected by the 
REH, that do not exceed an annual per patient average of 24 hours. This 
new provider type, effective January 1, 2023 will promote equity in 
health care for those living in rural communities by facilitating 
access to needed services. Eligible providers can submit their 
applications to convert to an REH to their Medicare Administrative 
Contractor, at which point they will be screened for eligibility and to 
ensure compliance with all Medicare enrollment requirements. CMS will 
be posting the number hospitals that have successfully transitioned to 
REHs on a publicly available CMS website.

    Question. Thank you for implementing my Over-the-Counter Hearing 
Aid Act with Senator Warren. This was a longstanding priority of mine. 
The Biden administration has stated they plan to end the COVID-19 
public health emergency (PHE) on May 11, 2023. While most telehealth 
provisions under Medicare will remain in effect through the end of CY 
2024, Iowa audiologists have communicated to me that telehealth CPT 
codes they use will no longer be reimbursable under Medicare after May 
11th. What is CMS planning to do to address potential access issues to 
telehealth services after May 11th?

    Answer. During the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) CMS 
utilized its regulatory flexibilities to expand access to telehealth 
services for Medicare beneficiaries. In order to maintain access to 
audiology services during the PHE, CMS temporarily allowed for Medicare 
coverage of certain audiology services when provided via telehealth. In 
the CY 2021 PFS final rule, CMS created a third category of criteria 
for adding services to the Medicare Telehealth Services List on a 
temporary basis following the end of the PHE: Category 3. This new 
category describes services that were added to the Medicare Telehealth 
Services List during the PHE for which there is likely to be clinical 
benefit when furnished via telehealth, but there is not yet sufficient 
evidence available to consider the services for permanent addition 
under the Category 1 or Category 2 criteria. Services added on a 
temporary, Category 3 basis will ultimately need to meet the criteria 
under Category 1 or 2 in order to be permanently added to the Medicare 
Telehealth Services List.

    As part of its CY 2023 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule final rule, 
CMS finalized alignment of availability of services on the telehealth 
list with the extension time frame enacted in the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2022 (CAA, 2022), which was for 151 days after the 
end of the PHE. In addition, in response to comments, CMS finalized the 
addition of several audiology CPT codes (CPT codes 92550, 92552, 92553, 
92555, 92556, 92557, 92563, 92565, 92567, 92568, 92570, 92587, 92588, 
92601, 92625, 92626, and 92627) to the Medicare Telehealth Services 
List on a Category 3 basis. The services CMS temporarily included on 
the Medicare Telehealth Services List on a Category 3 basis will 
continue to be included through the end of CY 2023.

    The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 further extended the 
telehealth flexibilities enacted in the CAA, 2022 through December 31, 
2024. Given the recent legislative changes, CMS has updated and 
simplified the Medicare Telehealth Services List to clarify that the 
services will be available through the end of CY 2023, which is 
available at https://www.cms.gov/medicare/medicare-general-information/
telehealth/telehealth-codes. CMS anticipates addressing updates to the 
Medicare Telehealth Services List for CY 2024 and beyond through our 
established processes as part of the CY 2024 Physician Fee Schedule 
rulemaking process. CMS will continue to assess the benefits of the use 
of telehealth for various services and is happy to provide technical 
assistance on any legislation you draft on this issue.

                Questions Submitted by Hon. John Cornyn
                              biosimilars
    Question. How is CMS working to ensure that there is adequate 
biosimilar uptake in Part D? As a lower cost alternative to pricier 
biologics, it is imperative that the agency put in place policies to 
ensure that seniors will have the options for biosimilars as part of 
their Medicare Part D benefit. With the expected number of new 
biosimilars expected to come out later this year, decisions about how 
the agency will create access is crucial.

    Is CMS working to ensure that seniors will have access to 
biosimilars on their Part D plan formularies, including those that are 
approved midyear?

    Answer. HHS is committed to encouraging the use of biosimilar 
biological products within the Secretary's scope of authority in order 
to reduce costs to both beneficiaries and the Federal Government. In 
general, however, a provision in the Part D statute prohibits the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services from interfering with the 
private negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and plan 
sponsors, requiring a particular formulary, or instituting a price 
structure for the reimbursement of covered Part D drugs. However, CMS 
has the authority to review Part D plan formularies to ensure that drug 
plans provide access to medically necessary treatments and do not 
discriminate against any particular types of beneficiaries. CMS uses 
this authority to review plan formularies for appropriate inclusion of 
all drug classes. HHS will continue using its authority where possible 
to seek to promote competition, support increased utilization of 
biosimilar and generic drugs, reduce the Federal Government's spending 
on drugs, and achieve greater equity in drug access and affordability 
for beneficiaries.
                         medicaid cms bulletin
    Question. CMS recently issued a bulletin on February 17th, ``Health 
Care-Related Taxes and Hold Harmless Arrangements Involving the 
Redistribution of Medicaid Payments.'' The bulletin seemed to indicate 
that it views these arrangements as not permissible.

    Does this bulletin represent a change that CMS is looking to 
implement?

    What steps is CMS looking to implement next? Is the agency 
considering rulemaking?

    How as the agency consulted States, and State Medicaid directors as 
part of this effort?

    Has CMS worked with stakeholders, such as safety net providers and 
children's hospitals?

    Answer. In February 2023, CMS issued an informational bulletin 
reiterating Federal requirements concerning health care-related taxes 
and hold harmless arrangements involving the redistribution of Medicaid 
payments. This guidance, which does not establish new policy, was 
issued as a reminder in response to questions received from several 
States about complying with this provision of law. CMS recognizes that 
health care-related taxes often finance critical programs that pay for 
care provided to Medicaid beneficiaries and shore up the health care 
safety net, and it will continue to approve permissible health care-
related taxes that meet Federal requirements and remains committed to 
working with States.
                             epsdt benefit
    Question. Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and 
Treatment (EPSDT) benefit is intended to guarantee that children have 
access to all medically necessary, age-appropriate services, including 
mental health services. Through the EPSDT benefit, children enrolled in 
Medicaid should have access to a range of mental health services across 
the continuum of care. Yet, while it sets an important standard, 
significant gaps in access persist for some mental health services, 
particularly for intermediate levels of care such as day programs and 
intensive outpatient treatment.

    As part of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, there was language 
to have HHS review EPSDT implementation and provide updated guidance to 
States. Can you give us an update on where your review stands and how 
you are identifying gaps to ensure equitable access to critical mental 
health services for children?

    Answer. The Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment 
(EPSDT) benefit provides comprehensive and preventive health-care 
services for most children under age 21 who are enrolled in Medicaid. 
EPSDT is key to ensuring that children and adolescents receive 
appropriate preventive, dental, mental health, developmental, and 
specialty services. States are required to provide comprehensive 
services and furnish all Medicaid coverable, medically necessary 
services needed to correct and ameliorate health conditions, based on 
certain Federal guidelines. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act 
directs HHS to review State implementation of EPSDT requirements; 
identify gaps and deficiencies with respect to State compliance with 
EPSDT requirements; provide technical assistance to States to address 
such gaps and deficiencies; and issue guidance to States on the 
Medicaid coverage requirements for such services, including best 
practices for ensuring children have access to comprehensive health-
care services, including children without a mental health or substance 
use disorder diagnosis. The statute requires HHS to conduct this review 
by June 2024.

                                 ______
                                 
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. John Thune
              indian health service provider credentialing
    Question. In January, Cesar Bartell, who worked as an optometrist 
at an Indian Health Service facility in Sisseton, SD was found to have 
a history of criminal charges for child molestation. As you know, this 
is not the first time a provider employed by IHS has been found to have 
a history of sexual abuse. I have raised concerns about a lack of 
oversight and transparency at the IHS for many years. My legislation 
with Senator Barrasso, the Restoring Accountability in the Indian 
Health Service Act, would modernize the IHS credentialing system and 
increase transparency. I understand IHS previously implemented a 
credentialing and privileging system for new applicants and re-
applicants at IHS, but clearly there are still issues with identifying 
issues with existing providers.

    What is HHS doing to ensure the IHS has complete information 
regarding a provider's history? Are there barriers if an investigation 
occurs outside the State or locality in which the provider is currently 
practicing?

    Answer. The Indian Health Service (IHS) Director, as one of her 
first actions as IHS Director, was to require all IHS-operated 
hospitals and health clinics to clearly post information on the Hotline 
for Reporting Child or Sexual Abuse, and to continue to conduct a 
review of all provider credentialing information. For example, IHS 
holds annual mandatory training, along with mandatory reporting on all 
incidents of inappropriate sexual conduct. Additionally, a 
credentialing review of providers is completed in regard to any red 
flags of inappropriate behavior or conduct, and intermittent audits and 
reports will be completed.

    We take prevention of patient abuse extremely seriously and are 
doing all we can to rebuild that trust. We have a strong patient safety 
program that is rolling out across the agency, have established 
mandatory reporting for all IHS staff with emphasis from agency 
leadership, and have tightened scrutiny of all credentialing of medical 
providers. The funding requested for the Office of Quality will support 
critical activities to improve the quality of patient care and support 
patient safety. The IHS requests $1.2 million for training, technical 
assistance, and support at the facility level on patient safety issues. 
Second, the IHS requests about $500,000 to identify patient safety and 
administrative risks before incidents occur, and to mitigate those 
risks across the agency.

    IHS is currently using the MD-Staff application \75\ for 
credentialing of all licensed providers (LPs) working in Federal 
facilities. MD staff complete automated primary source verification of 
multiple elements, including all (active and inactive) State licenses, 
DEA registration, OIG sanctions, and National Practitioner Data Bank 
(NPDB) queries. Furthermore, credential verification is automatic and 
occurs continuously once a provider is hired. For example, should a new 
adverse report be submitted to the NPDB on an IHS provider, the system 
would notify the medical staff professional within 24 hours, prompting 
review. Finally, LPs are privileged at hire, after their first year 
(provisional privileges), and every 2 years thereafter, which requires 
a complete review of their credentials.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \75\ The MD-Staff application is a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) 
software solution to automate and standardize the data collection, 
storage, access, and approval (decision-making) credentialing process 
for Indian Health Service. Credentialing consists of the validation of 
licenser, training, education, proficiency, and currency of 
professional health-care skills. The purpose also includes verifying 
and auditing reporting systems on compliance with State, Federal, and 
other applicable regulations.

    An implicit barrier in this process are the existing database 
limitations, wherein reporting bodies or States may or may not report/
participate and may, thus, preclude IHS from obtaining complete 
information regarding a provider's history. Accordingly, IHS is limited 
by what information is reported or provided to IHS by third parties 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
such as State license boards or the NPDB.

    Question. Will you commit to working with me and my staff on the 
Restoring Accountability in the Indian Health Service Act, in order to 
solve this persistent problem?

    Answer. The Department, as well as the Indian Health Service, is 
committed to working with you and your staff on this legislation.
                               telehealth
    Question. Congress extended many of the flexibilities for Medicare 
telehealth services that were enacted during the pandemic through the 
end of 2024. We have learned a lot about telehealth during the 
pandemic, and we should use these lessons and data to inform long-term 
policy solutions to benefit patients and providers. That is why I'm 
concerned that your budget does not include any long-term legislative 
telehealth proposals in Medicare.

    I originally authored legislation with my colleagues, the CONNECT 
Act, prior to the pandemic, in an effort to support permanent access to 
telehealth services. I am working to use the insights we've gained from 
the pandemic to ensure the CONNECT Act now reflects the best long-term 
policies for patients and providers in the future.

    Are there specific telehealth policies that your administration 
wants to work with Congress on to ensure progress isn't lost when the 
flexibilities expire at the end of 2024? Will you commit to working 
with me and my colleagues on the CONNECT Act to ensure patients have 
permanent access to telehealth?

    Answer. In response to the COVID-19 public health emergency, which 
is set to expire in May 2023, flexibilities for Medicare telehealth 
services were issued through legislative and regulatory authorities to 
increase access to care for patients and providers. The Consolidated 
Appropriations Act of 2023 recently extended many of these 
flexibilities through December 31, 2024. Extended telehealth 
flexibilities include waiving geographic and site of service 
originating site restrictions so that Medicare patients can continue to 
use telehealth services from their home and allowing audio-only 
telehealth services. Additionally, the expanded list of providers 
eligible to deliver telehealth services is also extended so Medicare 
beneficiaries can continue to receive telehealth services furnished by 
physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech language 
pathologists, and audiologists, as well as receive telehealth services 
from Rural Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers 
through December 31, 2024. If you are interested in drafting 
legislation to make these waivers permanent, CMS would be happy to 
provide technical assistance.

    Additionally, recent legislative and regulatory changes made 
several telehealth flexibilities permanent. Federally Qualified Health 
Centers and Rural Health Clinics can furnish certain behavioral and 
mental health services via telecommunications technology. Medicare 
patients can continue to receive these telehealth services in their 
home as geographic restrictions on the originating site are eliminated 
for these telehealth services. Certain behavioral and mental telehealth 
services can be delivered using audio-only communication platforms, and 
rural emergency hospitals can serve as an originating site for 
telehealth services.

    CMS would be happy to provide technical assistance on legislation 
to make these waivers permanent or any other legislation you have to 
expand access to telehealth.

    With respect to HRSA, certain telehealth flexibilities have shown 
to be beneficial to health-care providers and underserved patients, 
such as relieving patients of originating site requirements and 
allowing Federally Qualified Health Centers/Rural Health Clinics to 
serve as distant site providers so patients can access telehealth 
services at home. Access to quality audio-only telehealth services has 
been of assistance to individuals from underserved communities with 
limited data plans or other constraints that makes video more 
challenging or costly.
       modernizing the exchange of electronic health information
    Question. In the 21st Century Cures final rule, ONC stated that it 
intended the rule to be consistent with the privacy right for patients 
already contained in HIPAA. However, I've heard from providers that 
there continue to be cases where providers are not able to share EHR 
data within their own system as is allowed under HIPAA. If the rule 
works as intended, access to electronic health information should occur 
while protecting privacy and supporting efficient health-care 
operations for providers and patients. The FY 2024 budget states that 
the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information 
Technology (ONC) will continue to carry out the 21st Century Cures 
Final Rule by providing oversight on information blocking practices.

    Are you concerned that electronic health record (EHR) vendors may 
still be limiting the exchange of data, even in scenarios where 
information sharing is permitted under HIPAA?

    How will you ensure there is appropriate oversight of ONC to ensure 
data is being shared as intended in the final rule?

    Answer. Preventing inappropriate interference with access, 
exchange, or use of patients' electronic health information that is 
permitted by the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and consistent with 
the patient's privacy preferences is an HHS priority. When the 
information is needed to support safe, coordinated care, any limits EHR 
vendors may be imposing for anti-competitive purposes would be a 
serious concern that HHS will address where it is identified. Survey 
data and information blocking claims received by HHS suggest hospitals 
and potentially other health-care providers are not yet reporting 
possible information blocking as often as they might be experiencing 
it. HHS continues to promote to health-care providers the opportunity 
to report information blocking they experience as well as avoiding 
engaging in it themselves.

    The HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG), in close ongoing 
coordination with other parts of HHS, including ONC and the Office for 
Civil Rights (OCR), has the lead on information blocking enforcement. 
The 21st Century Cures Act gave the HHS Inspector General authority to 
investigate any claim that a health IT developer, health-care provider, 
health information network, or health information exchange engaged in 
information blocking.\76\ In the coming weeks, HHS expects to publish 
our Office of the Inspector General (OIG) final rule establishing 
procedures necessary to use the 21st Century Cures Act authority to 
investigate information blocking claims and take enforcement action 
against certain entities. Statutory authority to determine civil money 
penalties specific to information blocking by health IT developers 
(such as EHR vendors), health information exchanges, and health 
information networks references violations identified through an OIG 
investigation.\77\ OIG and ONC actively coordinate and will continue to 
do so to ensure that, in addition to any civil money penalty action 
taken by HHS through OIG, ONC also takes appropriate action under the 
ONC Health IT Certification Program with respect to any Program-
participating EHR vendors (or other Program-participating developers) 
determined by OIG to have committed information blocking.

           modernization of the ihs electronic health record
    Question. Thank you for including more specific information in the 
budget on the plans to update the Indian Health Service's electronic 
health record system. As you know, I've continued to ask about the 
progress and schedule just about every year, as I don't want to lose 
sight of this important issue. The administration is proposing to make 
all funding in IHS mandatory starting in 2025, which is a major change 
in how IHS is funded. That said, the information included in the budget 
seems to be in the context of a major change in how IHS is funded.

    How will the Department continue the efforts on IT modernization if 
the larger IHS proposal is not adopted?

    Answer. The Indian Health Service (IHS) will continue to move 
forward with modernization. The IHS released the Request for Proposals 
for the enterprise electronic health record (EHR) system on August 4, 
2022, and anticipates selecting a product in Fall 2023. The Health IT 
Modernization project is significantly ramping up, and the IHS needs 
major funding increases to build the system, remediate sites, and 
deploy the new system. The President's budget fully funds the current 
$6.2-billion EHR modernization estimate starting in FY 2024, and 
continues with additional resources in the out years.

    The IHS is currently in the one-time capital investment phase of 
the modernization project. Once costs for ongoing operations and 
maintenance are understood, the IHS will begin discussing how those 
recurring costs should be allocated among sites. The current estimate 
for the modernization project includes the funding necessary to support 
all Federal, Tribal, and urban sites. The IHS continues to provide a 
quarterly Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer on the health IT 
modernization project and has provided a consultation letter to the 
chair and ranking member of the House and Senate Appropriations 
Committees in accordance with the bill language included in the IHS 
appropriation.

    If the IHS budget proposal is not adopted, it could substantially 
slow progress to provide effective digital capabilities, force the IHS 
to continue development in the Resource and Patient Management System 
(RPMS), and risk creating confusion and fragmentation among Federal, 
Tribal, and urban partners. RPMS is unsustainable, as demonstrated by 
both internal (OIG) and external (GAO) assessments. If the IHS is 
unable to proceed with meaningful modernization, the agency risks 
catastrophic failures in health-care delivery, quality outcomes, and 
third party revenue collections that are critical to the IHS and its 
tribal and urban partners in achieving our collective mission.
                       durable medical equipment
    Question. As you know, there are no competitively bid areas in 
South Dakota for the Competitive Bidding Program for Durable Medical 
Equipment (DMEPOS) in Medicare. However, CMS uses the bidding rates as 
the basis for payment amounts in the non-bidding areas. In the past, 
Congress and CMS have addressed low payment rates for Medicare DMEPOS 
items in non-Competitively Bid Areas (CBAs) by using a blended rate. In 
the 2020 CARES Act, Congress provided a 50/50 blended rate for rural 
areas and a 75/25 blended rate for non-rural, non-CBAs. CMS has made 
the 50/50 blended rates permanent, while 75/25 rates (extended by 
Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023) are slated to 
end at the end of this year.

    Does the administration plan to take any administrative action to 
address the rate for non-rural, non CBAs?

    What are the administration's plans for the next round of the 
Medicare Durable Medical Equipment Competitive Bidding Program?

    Answer. As you note, the CARES Act increased the payment rates to a 
75/25 blend for durable medical equipment (DME) and enteral nutrients, 
supplies, and equipment furnished in areas other than rural and non-
contiguous non-CBAs through the duration of the COVID-19 Public Health 
Emergency (PHE) period. In the May 2020 COVID-19 Interim Final Rule 
with Comment Period (IFC), CMS stated its belief that the purpose of 
this provision of the CARES Act was to aid suppliers in furnishing 
items under very challenging situations during the PHE. Furthermore, 
CMS has long maintained that the fully adjusted rates in nonrural non-
CBAs are sufficient. CMS will continue to monitor payments in all non-
CBAs, as well as health outcomes, assignment rates, and other 
information.

                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Tim Scott
    Question. South Carolina's seniors and disabled rely on Medicare 
Advantage to provide them with high-quality and affordable care and 
especially value the additional benefits and lower co-pays which 
reduces their out-of-pocket costs.

    Have you conducted an analysis on how this proposal would directly 
impact providers and beneficiaries in each State and territory--
including rural versus urban areas?

    Have you conducted an analysis on how this proposal will directly 
impact medically vulnerable patient populations like dual-eligibles, 
those with chronic conditions (including diabetes), and depression?

    Have you conducted an analysis on how this proposal will directly 
impact diverse beneficiaries?

    Have you analyzed how this proposal will impact the national 
health-care workforce and physician shortage in each State and 
territory--including rural versus urban areas?

    If so, can you share these analyses with the committee?

    Answer. The proposed 2024 Advance Notice published on February 1, 
2023 includes a series of routine technical updates, improvements, and 
recalibrations that would result in an increase to MA payments for 
plans in 2024. MA payments are expected to increase by 1.03 percent 
from 2023 to 2024, as proposed. This is about a $4-billion increase in 
MA payments for next year. The proposals in the Advance Notice improve 
payment accuracy to ensure MA plan payments better reflect the expected 
costs of care, with higher payments going to plans serving people with 
greater health-care needs. This helps ensure that people in MA can 
continue to access the care they need.

    Additionally, there are protective features built into the MA risk 
adjustment system to ensure that plans caring for dually eligible 
individuals are paid adequately, and nothing in this proposal changes 
those features. We will continue to pay much more for someone who is 
dually eligible than someone who is not, even when they have the same 
diagnoses. These higher payments decrease incentives for plans to favor 
healthier enrollees or discriminate against sicker patients.

    To the extent beneficiaries who are low-income or who are living in 
rural or underserved areas have greater health-care needs, the proposed 
model would better compensate plans for that care. Furthermore, Federal 
law protects most dually eligible individuals from any cost sharing for 
Medicare services, so specific plans changes in cost sharing cannot be 
passed onto those dually eligible beneficiaries.

    Under the proposed model updates, Medicare, and thus MA plans, will 
continue to pay for the services beneficiaries need to treat chronic 
conditions such as diabetes. As part of updating the risk adjustment 
model, certain diabetes codes were removed because they are not 
reliable predictors of cost. Over 300 diabetes codes remain in the risk 
adjustment model. The proposed model would provide extra payments for 
patients with diabetes who have complications associated with diabetes, 
like chronic kidney disease, heart disease, and diabetic retinopathy. 
In addition, there are other payment factors, such as a condition count 
bump, that increases payment when beneficiaries have more 
comorbidities. Thus, the 2024 Advance Notice proposals for this aspect 
of the MA risk model would provide a more targeted and accurate payment 
increase for a diabetic patient because it adjusts MA payments 
according to the patient's full health profile, rather than using only 
a diabetes diagnosis as a proxy for increased health-care costs. This 
approach would help ensure that higher payments are directed to 
diabetic patients with the greatest health-care costs.

    Medicare, and thus MA plans, would also continue to pay for the 
services beneficiaries need to treat depression. The proposed model 
does not impact coverage of Medicare services or requirements for MA 
plans to deliver covered services. Under the 2024 Advance Notice, MA 
payments would more accurately reflect the costs of care associated 
with this condition. While some depression codes were removed from the 
model because they did not predict cost well or were duplicative or 
were related to diagnoses in remissions, more than 350 depression codes 
remain in the risk adjustment model.

    Question. My colleague on this committee, Senator Cortez Masto, and 
I co-led a letter to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 
Administrator Brooks-LaSure expressing bipartisan support for the 
Medicare Advantage program and the high-quality, affordable care it 
provides to over 27 million seniors and people with disabilities. In 
the CHRONIC Care Act, Congress allowed Medicare Advantage plans to 
cover telehealth more fully. Consistent with that approach, CMS has 
allowed telehealth encounters to count toward risk adjustment programs 
so that telehealth can be offered as a benefit without penalty.

    Can you assure this committee that CMS will maintain this policy so 
as not to jeopardize access to care via telehealth for seniors and 
people with disabilities?

    Answer. In January 2021 CMS issued an updated health plan 
management system memo on the applicability of diagnoses from 
telehealth services for the purposes of risk adjustment. Under the 
memo, Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations and other organizations 
that submit diagnoses for risk adjusted payment are able to submit 
diagnoses for risk adjustment that are from telehealth visits when 
those visits meet all criteria for risk adjustment eligibility, which 
include being from an allowable inpatient, outpatient, or professional 
service, and from a face-to-face encounter. Diagnoses resulting from 
telehealth services continue to meet the risk adjustment face-to-face 
requirement when the services are provided using interactive audio 
telecommunication simultaneously with video telecommunication to permit 
real-time interactive communication with the beneficiary. This policy 
remains in effect.

    Question. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 
stated in January 2023: ``CMS will seek feedback and insights from a 
broad range of interested parties throughout implementation of the IRA, 
including implementation of the Negotiation Program. CMS is committed 
to collaborating with and engaging the public in the policymaking 
process. CMS will work closely with patients and consumers, Part D plan 
sponsors and Medicare Advantage organizations, drug manufacturers, 
hospitals and health-care providers, wholesalers, pharmacies, and 
others.''

    However, in the Part D Negotiation guidance released March 16, 
2023, the agency said it will NOT take comments on proposals for 
selecting the specific drugs to be negotiated, including particulars 
around the basis for selecting the drugs and the extent to which drug 
manufacturers may appeal CMS's decisions. These seem like pretty 
important factors that could significantly affect a company's 
operations and the patients they serve.

    Given the IRA legislation has NOT afforded affected stakeholders no 
judicial or administrative review in many areas, why would the agency 
suppress the voice of impacted stakeholders, when they specifically 
pledged they would seek feedback?

    Answer. CMS recognizes that public input will help to achieve 
successful implementation and broadly welcomes input from the public at 
all times. In the initial guidance for the Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program, CMS decided on key topics to seek comment where 
CMS would like specific input from the public to operationalize the new 
program. Due to timing constraints and the requirement to publish the 
selected drug list for initial price applicability year 2026 by 
September 1, 2023, CMS is issuing guidance on topics related to drug 
selection as final, without a comment solicitation.

    CMS has sought and will continue to seek feedback and insights from 
a broad range of interested parties throughout the implementation of 
the Inflation Reduction Act, including but not limited to comment on 
initial guidance. CMS is committed to collaborating and engaging with 
the public in the policymaking process. CMS is working closely with 
patients and consumers, Part D plan sponsors and Medicare Advantage 
organizations, drug manufacturers, hospitals and health-care providers, 
wholesalers, pharmacies, and others. CMS is engaging and will continue 
to engage interested parties through national stakeholder calls, 
quarterly strategic meetings, and monthly technical calls with CMS 
staff. In addition, members of the public are welcome to share feedback 
and input in writing by email at: IRARebateandNegotiation@cms.hhs.gov.

    Question. Since the bipartisan Orphan Drug Act was enacted 40 years 
ago, rare disease and cancer patients have benefited from the 
development of over 600 new treatments. This is a tremendous 
achievement, though there's more work to be done. Too many patients 
living with rare diseases and cancers still have no treatments 
available to them. Unfortunately, the Inflation Reduction Act threatens 
the continued success of the Orphan Drug Act. Specifically, it does not 
protect therapies that treat two or more orphan diseases from 
government price setting. As a result, we already know of two companies 
that have cited the IRA as a reason not to continue rare disease drug 
development.

    Will you commit to doing what you can via guidance and rulemaking 
to ensure that the pipeline of life-altering therapies continues for 
patients living with rare diseases (like Sickle Cell, Parkinson's, ALS, 
et cetera) and cancers?

    Answer. FDA remains strongly committed to doing what we can via 
guidance for industry and stakeholder engagement activities to maintain 
and promote the robustness of the development pipeline for safe and 
effective drugs and biological products to treat patients with rare 
diseases, including rare cancers. FDA has published more than 18 
guidance documents since 2018 on topics that are highly relevant to 
drug and biological product development for rare diseases, including 
rare cancers. Some recent examples include:

          2023 Draft Guidance for Industry: Clinical Trial 
        Considerations to Support Accelerated Approval of Oncology 
        Therapeutics.\78\

    \78\ https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-
guidance-documents/clinical-trial-considerations-support-accelerated-
approval-oncology-therapeutics. This draft guidance, when finalized, 
will represent FDA's current thinking on this topic.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
          2023 Draft Guidance for Industry: Considerations for the 
        Design and Conduct of Externally Controlled Trials for Drug and 
        Biological Products.

        Neurodegenerative Diseases.
          2022 Draft Guidance for Industry: Tissue Agnostic Drug 
        Development in Oncology.

    Of note, with regard to promoting the development of treatments for 
more than one rare disease at a time, both FDA and NIH, along with 
several other entities, are working collaboratively to expedite 
development of gene therapies for rare diseases that are caused by a 
single genetic mutation and for which there is no commercial interest 
in developing therapies due to each disease's rarity. This effort, the 
Bespoke Gene Therapy Consortium, focuses on developing common gene 
therapy platforms and standards that can be used in the manufacture of 
several different gene therapies, each for a different rare disease, 
and thus would increase efficiency overall.

    Further, NIH and NCATS remain committed to supporting research to 
find treatments and cures for rare diseases and conditions without a 
treatment, and to increase the speed of therapeutic and diagnostic 
development. At NIH, NCATS's Division of Rare Diseases Research 
Innovation provides leadership, coordination and collaboration on rare 
disease research programs across the NIH. Research on specific rare 
diseases is supported by many NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices 
(ICOs) as falls within their respective missions.

    NCATS supports rare disease research projects with applicability to 
many diseases at a time, and works with other HHS operating divisions 
to ensure appropriate resources and expertise are being applied. One 
such program involving cross agency collaboration and targeting rare 
diseases is the Bespoke Gene Therapy Consortium (BGTC), a partnership 
with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Foundation for the 
National Institutes of Health (FNIH), NCATS and 10 other NIH Institutes 
and Centers (ICs), and several pharmaceutical companies and nonprofit 
organizations, that will streamline gene therapy development and 
products for rare disorders of no commercial interest. For BGTC 
clinical trials, scientists will develop strategies for streamlining 
the regulatory processes for FDA approval of safe and effective gene 
therapies, and they will develop standardized approaches to preclinical 
testing. BGTC has narrowed the potential diseases to be studied to 14, 
and proposals for clinical trials are being reviewed, with the 5-6 
chosen trials to be announced in May 2023.

    Another collaborative research initiative is the NIH Common Fund's 
Somatic Cell Genome Editing (SCGE) program, led by NCATS and the 
National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). Phase 
1 of the program aims to develop high-quality tools for performing safe 
and effective genome editing in humans and then make these tools widely 
available to the research community to reduce the time and cost of 
developing new therapies. Based on the success of Phase 1, the Common 
Fund approved a second phase of the program, which will be focused more 
on accelerating somatic genome editing clinical trials. Applications 
have been reviewed, and funded projects will be announced shortly. FDA 
collaborated with the SCGE program throughout Phase 1, and given the 
greater focus on clinical trials in Phase 2, the NIH and FDA plan to 
establish a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to efficiently translate 
the results from Phase 2 projects into the clinic.

    Question. Diabetes is a major health crisis in our country, with 
continuing significant increases particularly in the rate of type 2 
diabetes, which can be prevented. In South Carolina, over 500,000 
adults have been diagnosed with diabetes, another 120,000 people have 
diabetes but are unaware, and 1.4 million have prediabetes. In total, 
that's over half the population of my State. Evidence shows that 
Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPP) delivered by all modalities of care 
are effective, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
recognized DPPs served hundreds of thousands of privately insured 
Americans in 2022 alone. In contrast, the Medicare Diabetes Prevention 
Program (MDPP), which severely restricts the number of suppliers, has 
served only 4,848 beneficiaries since 2018 according to a recent 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services evaluation report.

    With the potential of MDPP now recognized in the administration's 
budget, what is HHS doing to expand access to these important services 
through the online and distance learning modalities that have already 
been validated by the evidence base, by CDC and by the commercial 
market?

    Answer. CDC continues to implement, scale, sustain, and evaluate 
the National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) and projects 
that support its implementation. The National DPP relies on results-
based partnerships with State health departments, private 
organizations, insurers, and community-based organizations to deliver 
and pay for the National DPP.

    The National DPP has allowed virtual delivery since 2015. At the 
start of the pandemic, CDC helped lifestyle change program providers 
shift from in-person to virtual delivery. Since then, CDC has helped 
providers maintain and expand their capabilities to deliver the program 
virtually. For instance, CDC developed a Guide for Using Telehealth 
Technologies (https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pdfs/programs/
E_Telehealth_translation_product_508.pdf) to provide users with 
information to help inform their decisions regarding implementation of 
different telehealth technologies and to provide specific 
implementation considerations for each technology.

    CDC remains focused on increasing access to the National DPP 
lifestyle change program and funds national organizations to expand the 
program in medically underserved areas and communities at high risk for 
diabetes, including Medicare beneficiaries. For example, CDC has worked 
with the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors and other 
partners to implement a Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP) 
Enrollment Project. This project supports MDPP suppliers in promoting 
the program to Medicare beneficiaries; increasing health-care provider 
referrals to the program; and obtaining and using billing software to 
process and submit claims to CMS, which supports program 
sustainability.

    CDC has also collaborated with National Association of Chronic 
Disease Directors, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the 
American Medical Association to develop MDPP resources in its coverage 
toolkit (Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP) Implementation 
Resources--National DPP Coverage Toolkit, https://coveragetoolkit.org/
medicare/mdpp-implementation-resources/). Examples of these resources 
include a recorded webinar, frequently asked questions, and a fact 
sheet for MDPP suppliers to navigate changes to their programs during 
the public health emergency, such as flexibilities for virtual 
sessions.

    Additionally, as detailed by the White House National Strategy of 
Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, the administration set a goal of ending 
hunger and increasing healthy eating and physical activity by 2030 so 
fewer Americans experience diet-
related diseases--while reducing related health disparities. 
Integrating nutrition and health can optimize Americans' well-being and 
reduce health-care costs. Currently, only a limited number of Medicare 
beneficiaries are seeking nutrition and obesity counseling services. 
The President's FY 2024 budget includes a proposal to expand access to 
additional beneficiaries with nutrition or obesity-related chronic 
diseases and make additional providers eligible to furnish services.

    Medicare covers an array of services that aim to address obesity. 
For example, obesity screenings, intensive behavioral therapy for 
obesity for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability, 
bariatric surgical procedures, and diabetes screenings and 
participation in a diabetes prevention program are covered under 
Medicare in certain cases. Under current law, the Medicare statute 
excludes ``agents when used for anorexia, weight loss, or weight gain'' 
from the definition of a Part D drug in section 1860D-2(e) of the 
Social Security Act. Despite this statutory exclusion, Part D sponsors 
wishing to provide coverage of prescription weight loss agents may do 
so as a supplemental benefit to enhanced alternative Part D plans, as 
they can with other prescription drugs that are excluded from the 
definition of a Part D drug.

    Question. During the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provided flexibility 
to allow the virtual supervision of drug infusions by nurse 
practitioners through real-time audio/video technology. Providers have 
been expediently utilizing this flexibility throughout the PHE, when 
appropriate, which has increased access to care, maintained patient 
safety, and enabled patients to follow their treatment plans more 
easily without interruptions due to staffing shortages or canceled 
appointments. This flexibility is especially important and can be 
beneficial as the country continues to face widespread health-care 
workforce shortages and access issues for rural patients. In the 
Calendar Year 2023 Physician Fee Schedule (PFS), CMS declined to extend 
this flexibility beyond the PHE, though they said they would consider 
comments received from the proposed rule for potential future PFS 
rulemaking.

    Has CMS done any further evaluation of this vital flexibility, and 
do you plan on extending or making it permanent?

    Answer. During the public health emergency (PHE) for COVID-19, CMS 
temporarily modified the regulatory definition of direct supervision, 
which requires the supervising physician or practitioner to be 
``immediately available'' to furnish assistance and direction during 
the service, to include ``virtual presence'' of the supervising 
clinician through the use of real-time audio and video technology. 
Under our currently finalized policies, CMS will continue to permit 
direct supervision through a virtual presence through the end of the 
year in which the PHE ends (through December 31, 2023). We continue to 
gather information on this topic, and we appreciate the information 
provided by commenters in the CY 2023 Physician Fee Schedule Rule. We 
believe allowing additional time to collect information and evidence 
for direct supervision through virtual presence will help us to better 
understand the potential circumstances in which this flexibility could 
be appropriate permanently, outside of the PHE for COVID-19.

    Question. Medicare physician payments, which were dramatically 
altered following the passage of the Medicare Access and CHIP 
Reauthorization Act (MACRA) in 2015, and its impact on patient access 
to care remains a major issue for my constituents. In fact, adjusted 
for inflation in practice costs, Medicare physician pay actually 
declined 26 percent from 2001 to 2023, or by 1.8 percent per year on 
average. Congress has been forced to provide annual payment patches to 
prevent, in part, budget neutrality driven cuts to the Medicare 
Physician Fee Schedule. It is clear that the Medicare physician payment 
system is broken.

    What is HHS doing administratively to make the Medicare payment 
system run more smoothly? Does HHS to have the necessary authority to 
make improvements to the MACRA program?

    Answer. Ensuring adequate payment rates for physicians and other 
health-care professionals is essential in maintaining access to high-
quality and affordable health care. HHS appreciates Congress' 
leadership in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 to provide 
temporary, 1-year increases in payment amounts for all services under 
the physician fee schedule by 2.5 percent in 2023 and 1.25 percent in 
2024. HHS also appreciates Congress's work to extend incentive payments 
for clinicians who are qualifying participants in advanced alternative 
payment models through 2025. CMS does not have the legal authority to 
implement increases in payment outside of budget neutrality without 
additional action taken by Congress. Annual Medicare physician payment 
updates have been set in statute since 2015. CMS does not have the 
authority to use a different update. If Congress wants to change the 
law, we would be happy to provide technical assistance on legislation 
you draft.

    Question. The fall 2022 Department of Health and Humans Services 
Unified Agenda regulatory calendar currently lists April 2023 as the 
target date for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to 
release the Medicare Transitional Coverage for Emerging Technologies 
(TCET) proposed rule (CMS-3421, https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/
eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202210&RIN=0938-AU86), which would provide 
transitional Medicare coverage for new medical technologies.

    Can you assure this committee that CMS will issue the TCET proposed 
rule by April 2023, particularly given that this rule was initially 
scheduled for release in 2022, and originally discussed over 2 years 
ago when the Medicare Coverage of Innovative Technology rule was 
repealed? Assuming that CMS publishes the TCET proposed rule in April 
2023, when does the agency expect to release and implement the final 
rule?

    Answer. CMS remains committed to expanding access to health-care 
coverage and services, including new, innovative treatments when they 
are safe and appropriate. CMS rescinded the Medicare Coverage of 
Innovative Technology and Definition of ``Reasonable and Necessary'' 
(MCIT/R&N) final rule because of concerns that the provisions in the 
final rule may not have been sufficient to protect Medicare patients. 
By rescinding this rule, CMS will take action to better address those 
safety concerns in the future.

    Improving and modernizing the Medicare coverage process continues 
to be a priority, and we remain committed to providing stakeholders 
with more transparent and predictable coverage pathways. CMS is working 
as quickly as possible to advance multiple coverage process 
improvements that provide an appropriate balance of access to new 
technologies with necessary patient protections. As part of this 
effort, CMS has conducted several listening sessions to learn about 
stakeholders' most pressing challenges and to receive feedback from 
stakeholders about which coverage process improvements would be most 
valuable.

    CMS intends to explore coverage process improvements that will 
enhance access to innovative and beneficial medical devices in a way 
that will better suit the health-care needs of people with Medicare. 
This will also help to establish a process in which the Medicare 
program covers new technologies on the basis of scientifically sound 
clinical evidence, with appropriate health and safety protections in 
place for the Medicare population. HHS looks forward to working with 
you and hearing your feedback as we move forward with these efforts.

    Question. Unfortunately, South Carolina ranks towards the bottom of 
U.S. States when it comes to maternal mortality rates. A March 2022 
legislative brief from the South Carolina Maternal Mortality Review 
Committee showed that in 2021, South Carolina completed the review of 
pregnancy-related deaths occurring in 2018 which resulted in the first 
report of the South Carolina Pregnancy-Related Mortality Ratio (PRMR)--
35.3 pregnancy-related deaths per 100,000 live births in 2018. This 
number is well above the national average. This is clearly an issue 
impacting my constituents.

    The birthing-friendly hospital designation was implemented to show 
the public what hospitals were meeting the guidelines set out, but what 
are the administration's next steps beyond publishing that list?

    Answer. Medicaid is the largest single payer of pregnancy-related 
services and covers over 42 percent of births nationally. The 
Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) also covers pregnant 
adolescents and, in some States, low-income pregnant individuals with 
income over the Medicaid income limit. Together, Medicaid and CHIP play 
a critical role in ensuring access to care for pregnant and postpartum 
individuals, improving the quality of maternal health care, and 
addressing disparities in health outcomes and pregnant and postpartum 
care. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 gave States a new option to 
provide 12 months of continuous postpartum coverage to pregnant 
individuals enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP beginning April 1, 2022, for 
a period of 5 years.\79\ The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, 
made permanent this State option. To date, more than 30 States and the 
District of Columbia have elected to extend postpartum coverage, 
including South Carolina.\80\

    Additionally, in July 2022, CMS released its Maternity Care Action 
Plan (https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cms-maternity-care-action-
plan.pdf) to support the implementation of the Biden-Harris 
administration's Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis 
(https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/

across CMS to improve health outcomes and reduce inequities for people 
during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. CMS's 
implementation of the action plan will support the Biden-Harris 
administration's broad vision and call to action to improve maternal 
health.\81\ CMS is always happy to receive feedback from stakeholders 
on additional ways the agency can advance equity and reduce disparities 
in maternity care.

    Question. Due to the complexity of the pharmacy practice, many 
pharmacy students undertake a residency in a hospital. According to 
Federal regulation, pharmacy residency programs operated by hospitals 
that are affiliated with or owned by a health system or academic 
medical center are required to be directly controlled by those 
hospitals (42 CFR Sec. 413.85). These hospitals receive pass-through 
payments from Medicare. However, due to a lack of clarity and Medicare 
Administrative Contractors' (MACs) inconsistent interpretation of what 
is needed to meet the ``direct control'' requirement, hospitals and 
affiliated health systems need greater clarity from the Department of 
Health and Humans Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Services (CMS) to ensure compliance.

    Can hospitals share or contract for administrative functions the 
health systems, without violating 42 CFR Sec. 413.85(f)(1)(i)-(v)? What 
documentation would assist CMS in confirming that the hospital retains 
control of the residency program?

    Answer. Under Medicare regulations, Pharmacy Residency Programs 
must meet certain requirements in order to claim pass-through payments 
from Medicare. These regulations (42 CFR Sec. 413.85) require providers 
to meet a number of requirements with respect to training costs, 
curriculum, instruction, and program administration. Specifically, with 
respect to program administration, the regulations state that the 
operator must ``control the administration of the program, including 
collection of tuition (where applicable), control the maintenance of 
payroll records of teaching staff or students, or both (where 
applicable), and be responsible for day-to-day program operation. (A 
provider may contract with another entity to perform some 
administrative functions, but the provider must maintain control over 
all aspects of the contracted functions.)''

    Question. Many osteopathic medical students choose to actively 
pursue careers in primary care, strengthening the backbone of our 
Nation's health-care system. Fifty-seven percent of osteopaths practice 
in primary care (including family medicine, internal medicine, and 
pediatrics). Osteopathic medical education also has a proven history of 
establishing educational programs for medical students and residents 
that target the health-care needs of rural and underserved populations. 
Sixty percent of colleges of osteopathic medicine are located in health 
professional shortage areas, 64 percent require their students to go on 
clinical rotations in rural and underserved areas, and 88 percent have 
a stated public commitment to rural health. Further, 41 percent of 
graduating 2020-2021 osteopathic medical students plan to practice in a 
medically underserved or health shortage area; of those, 49 percent 
plan to practice in a rural community.

    What role will osteopaths and the osteopathic medical education 
community serve in the HHS Initiative to Strengthen Primary Health 
Care?

    Answer. Thank you for your question regarding the HHS Initiative to 
Strengthen Primary Health Care and the role of osteopathic physicians 
and the osteopathic medical education community. The HHS Initiative to 
Strengthen Primary Health Care was launched in September 2021 to 
strengthen the Federal foundation for the provision of whole person 
primary care for all, to improve: access to health care, the health and 
well-being of people, families and communities, and health equity. 
Primary care is the foundation and entry way of our health-care system 
and strong primary care has been documented to improve health, 
longevity, and health equity.

    A first deliverable of the HHS Initiative to Strengthen Primary 
Health Care is an HHS Action Plan to Strengthen Primary Care. This has 
been collaboratively developed by 14 HHS Operating and Staff Divisions 
and coordinated by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health. 
The action plan, which outlines actions HHS will take in FY 2023 and 
2024, under current funding and statutory authority, is in the final 
stages of HHS clearance and will be released later this year. The HHS 
Action Plan focuses on increasing investment in primary care and 
advancing effective payment models, strengthening the workforce, 
improving equitable access to primary care, advancing digital health to 
support primary care, and advancing primary care research and its 
translation into practice.

    Primary care clinicians are physicians, nurse practitioners, 
physician assistants, and clinical nurse specialists who practice 
primary care. They often practice in a team that may include nurses, 
medical assistants, case managers, community health workers, and other 
staff members. With integration of other clinical services and primary 
care, such as behavioral health, oral health and clinical pharmacy, the 
team expands its multiple disciplines. For physicians, the major 
specialties of primary care are family medicine, general internal 
medicine, general pediatrics, and geriatrics.

    Osteopathic physicians are important members of the primary care 
physician workforce and, as you note, are particularly important for 
the primary care workforce in medically underserved and rural areas. In 
addition, the osteopathic medicine approach, which focuses on health 
and well-being and holistic, person-centered care, is completely 
aligned with the aims and vision of the HHS Action Plan to Strengthen 
Primary Care. Osteopathic medical education is also very much 
community-based, which the HHS Initiative aims to foster. Thus, 
osteopathic physicians and osteopathic medical education are integral 
to the HHS Initiative to Strengthen Primary Health Care and the HHS 
Action Plan to Strengthen Primary Care.

    In the process of developing the HHS primary care action plan, the 
American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) 
responded to the HHS Initiative to Strengthen Primary Health Care 
Request for Information and the OASH Primary Health Care team held a 
listening session with AACOM to discuss osteopathic medical and 
graduate medical education.

                                 ______
                                 
               Questions Submitted by Hon. James Lankford
                         unaccompanied children
    Question. In Fiscal Year 2022, the Department of Homeland Security 
referred 128,904 unaccompanied children to the Office of Refugee 
Resettlement. That is more than triple the number of unaccompanied 
children that arrived to the United States in fiscal year 2017. In 
response to this dramatic increase in vulnerable children coming to the 
border, The New York Times reports that the Department of Health and 
Human Services has prioritized speed over safety when placing 
unaccompanied children with sponsors.

    Moreover, myself and six other Senators sent a letter to you last 
year that has gone unanswered expressing our concern with ORR's 
dependence on Field Guidance #21 which instructs staff to place 
pregnant unaccompanied children in ORR facilities based on the State's 
abortion laws in which the facility is located. A child's referral to 
ORR is an opportunity to treat them with care while searching for 
appropriate, vetted sponsors, not an opportunity to encourage the 
taking of unborn life. Every life is worthy of protection, born or 
unborn. In light of these concerns, please answer the following 
questions.

    How many abortions has HHS ORR facilitated for unaccompanied minors 
in its custody? Please include a breakdown of chemical abortions and 
surgical abortions and whether such abortion took place at an ORR 
facility.

    Answer. ORR has strict confidentiality policies related to sharing 
health-care information of the children it serves, including regarding 
their reproductive health. ORR policy requires, to the greatest extent 
possible, placement of pregnant unaccompanied children requesting an 
abortion in ORR programs that are State licensed to care for pregnant 
children and in an appropriate location to support the child's health-
care needs. This includes access to an appropriate medical provider who 
is able to legally perform the requested abortion. The particulars of 
the abortion procedure are the purview of medical providers, not ORR.

    Question. How much Federal funding has HHS spent on facilitating 
abortions for minors including, staff time, transportation and 
accommodation costs? Please provide a breakdown of the costs by type.

    Answer. ORR complies with Federal law, including Federal 
appropriation restrictions regarding payment for abortions as passed by 
Congress.

    Question. Please provide a list of all States and localities where 
HHS ORR has transported pregnant unaccompanied minors in order to 
facilitate their access to abortion.

    Answer. ORR does not capture this information in a reportable 
format. As a matter of policy, travel to access comprehensive medical 
services is permissible and routine for unaccompanied children in ORR 
care and custody (see ORR Unaccompanied Children (UC) Program Policy 
Guide Sections 3.4, 3.4.3 and 3.4.4, https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/
policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-3).

    Question. What steps is HHS taking to coordinate with law 
enforcement to identify and remove children from unsafe sponsorships? 
How many children has HHS removed from such unsafe sponsorships since 
January 2021? Please share with the committee a breakdown of the number 
and reasons for such termination?

    Answer. ORR's custodial authority over unaccompanied children ends 
when a child is released from ORR care. ORR does not have the authority 
to remove a child from a household once released--that authority 
resides with each State's child protective services.

    ORR conducts a minimum of three safety and well-being calls to 
children and sponsors after ORR releases a child from its care. ORR 
cannot require children and sponsors to participate in safety and well-
being calls, and they may choose not to answer a call for a variety of 
reasons. Also, upon their release, ORR provides children with 
information on the ORR National Call Center (ORRNCC), a 24-hour, 7 days 
a week, resource. Care providers, post-release services (PRS) 
providers, and ORRNCC staff are required to document and report any 
safety concern, in accordance with mandatory reporting laws, State 
licensing requirements, Federal laws and regulations, and ORR policies 
and procedures to ORR, as well as to the appropriate local law 
enforcement agency, State and local child protective services, or both. 
Over the last 2 months, ORR has implemented a requirement for the 
ORRNCC to provide children who call the helpline and express safety 
concerns with information regarding the authorities to which their 
safety concerns will be reported. It also connects children directly 
with the appropriate authority when possible and place an additional 
follow-up call to the child to confirm if any further actions are 
needed. If a placement is found to no longer be safe for a child, ORR 
and its grant recipients and contractors alert the necessary law 
enforcement entities and child protective services, which have the 
legal authority to take appropriate action--an authority that does not 
rest with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

    Question. What is the extent of Interagency Coordination with HHS 
Office of Refugee Resettlement, DHS, and DOL on ensuring the welfare of 
unaccompanied children at the border?

    Answer. Under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Trafficking 
Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2008, ORR is legally 
required to provide for the care and custody of all unaccompanied 
children from the moment they enter ORR's custody following a referral 
from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or other Federal 
entity until they are appropriately and safely released to a vetted 
sponsor. For additional information about ORR's vetting policies, see 
ORR UC Program Policy Guide section 2, https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/
policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-2.

    ORR and DHS coordinate the transfer of unaccompanied children from 
DHS custody to ORR custody. At the time of referral, DHS shares all 
pertinent information related to the unaccompanied child to facilitate 
the child's placement into ORR's custody. This information includes 
basic biographical data on the child; situational factors such as 
health, pregnancy, travel companions; human trafficking indicators; and 
any known criminal records or behavioral issues. DHS enters all 
information via the Unaccompanied Children Portal--ORR's system of 
records. ORR uses this information to make a placement designation 
within 24 hours and notifies both the referring agency and the care 
provider by email when a suitable placement becomes available, which by 
statute must occur within 72 hours of DHS's determination of the 
child's unaccompanied child status. DHS's Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) is responsible for the physical transfer of 
unaccompanied children to ORR-funded care provider facilities. The ICE 
transportation contractor coordinates directly with U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection (CBP) and ORR for operational arrangements and 
estimate time of arrival notices.

    Coordination between HHS and the U.S. Department of Labor are 
ongoing. On March 23, 2023, the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour 
Division (DOL/WHD) and HHS's Administration for Children and Families 
signed an agreement to formalize a partnership between the agencies and 
outline procedures the agencies will follow as they work together to 
deepen information-sharing, coordination, training, and education. The 
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) seeks to maximize DOL/WHD's enforcement 
of the child labor protections within the Fair Labor Standards Act and 
to enhance HHS/ACF's ability to protect children from exploitation and 
to connect individuals to needed benefits and services. The MOA 
includes unprecedented steps for greater collaboration between the two 
agencies to prevent and address illegal child labor.

    Question. On February 27th, HHS announced a 4-week audit of their 
vetting process for sponsors for unaccompanied children. Will you 
commit to providing the committee a copy of the written report 
describing the outcome of your audit and provide an interagency 
briefing for the committee following the HHS audit of sponsor vetting 
processes?

    Answer. ORR looks forward to providing more information on the 
outcome of the audit soon, which will inform ongoing process 
improvements to ORR's UC program. Further information regarding the 
audit is anticipated soon.
                           health in america
    Question. In your opening statement, you mentioned that HHS is 
working on policies that would help our health system not be an 
``illness care'' system, but a ``wellness care'' system instead.

    What efforts has HHS taken to address health problems in America 
through healthy eating and lifestyle changes instead of solely focusing 
on increased funds to public health programs?

    Answer. By far, the greatest burden of disease in the United States 
is attributable to diseases related to poor nutrition and low rates of 
physical activity. At the most foundational level, HHS leads the 
development of evidence-based nutrition and physical activity 
guidelines, which are the basis for numerous initiatives designed to 
advance health and prevent disease in America. These foundational 
documents have been iteratively produced for decades. A description of 
the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Physical Activity 
Guidelines for Americans can be found below, along with examples of 
initiatives that HHS has created to implement these guidelines, to help 
improve healthy eating and physical activity among diverse populations.

    HHS also works with Federal partners to develop national objectives 
related to healthy eating and physical activity through its 
longstanding Healthy People (https://health.gov/healthypeople) 
initiative, as congressionally mandated. By focusing action across 
public health and related sectors of government and civil society 
toward achieving these key Healthy People objectives, we can improve 
health and well-being.

    Through the COVID-19 pandemic, HHS has coordinated a whole of 
government initiative--Equitable Long-Term Recovery and Resilience 
(https://health.gov/our-work/national-health-initiatives/equitable-
long-term-recovery-and-resilience)--to develop and implement a Federal 
plan that has the potential to orient most extant Federal resources to 
favorable outcomes in individual and community resilience, as defined 
in the framework of Vital Conditions for Well-being. This broader 
initiative is designed to affect longitudinal change at a systems level 
such that the conditions for healthy living and thriving are enhanced 
equitably across communities.
Improving Healthy Eating Through Evidence-Based Guidance: Dietary 
        Guidelines for Americans
    The U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and 
Agriculture (USDA) work together to update and release the statutorily 
mandated Dietary Guidelines for Americans (Dietary Guidelines, https://
www.dietaryguidelines.gov/) every 5 years. The Dietary Guidelines 
provides advice on what to eat and drink to meet nutrient needs, 
promote health, and prevent disease. Each edition of the Dietary 
Guidelines reflects the current body of nutrition science and is 
developed and written for a professional audience, including 
policymakers, health-care providers, nutrition educators, and Federal 
nutrition program operators.

    On January 19, 2023, the HHS and USDA announced the appointment of 
20 nationally recognized nutrition and public health experts to serve 
on the 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. The Committee is 
tasked with reviewing the current body of nutrition science on specific 
topics and questions and developing a scientific report that includes 
its independent, science-based advice for HHS and USDA to consider. The 
Committee's review, along with public comments on its scientific report 
and agency input, will help inform HHS and USDA as they develop the 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2025-2030.

    Examples of HHS efforts to implement the Dietary Guidelines:

        1.  Toolkit for Health Professionals: Health professionals play 
        a key role in encouraging healthy food and beverage choices. To 
        assist health professionals in implementing the evidence-based 
        nutrition guidance found in the Dietary Guidelines for 
        Americans, 2020-2025, the HHS Office of Disease Prevention and 
        Health Promotion developed a suite of materials (https://
        health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/dietary-
        guidelines/current-dietary-guidelines/toolkit-professionals) to 
        help health professionals start a conversation and share key 
        messages with patients, clients, and peers.

        2.  Updated definition of the ``healthy'' claim: On September 
        28, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration issued a proposed 
        rule to update the definition of the nutrient content claim 
        ``healthy'' to align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 
        2020-2025 and the updated Nutrition Facts label. The 
        ``healthy'' claim can act as a quick signal on food package 
        labels to help empower consumers, including those with lower 
        nutrition knowledge, with information to identify foods that 
        will help them build healthy eating patterns.

    Diet-related chronic diseases in the United States are the leading 
causes of death and disability. Healthy eating patterns, which include 
fruits, vegetables, lower-fat dairy, and whole grains, are associated 
with improved health, such as reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, 
type 2 diabetes, certain types of cancers, and being overweight or 
obese. Providing informative and accessible food labeling empowers 
consumers and may help foster a healthier food supply for all if some 
manufacturers include more fruits, vegetables, dairy, and whole grains 
and limit saturated fat, sodium, and added sugars in their products to 
qualify to use the updated claim.
Improving Physical Activity Through Evidence-Based Guidance: Physical 
        Activity Guidelines for Americans
    The Physical Activity Guidelines (https://health.gov/our-work/
nutrition-physical-activity/physical-activity-guidelines/current-
guidelines) is an essential resource for health professionals and 
policymakers. It includes recommendations for Americans ages 3 years 
and over--including people at increased risk of chronic disease--and 
provides evidence-based advice on how physical activity can help 
promote health and reduce the risk of chronic disease. The Guidelines 
serves as the primary, authoritative voice of the Federal Government 
for evidence-based guidance on physical activity, fitness, and health 
for Americans.

    HHS released the first edition of the Guidelines (https://
health.gov/our-work/physical-activity/previous-guidelines/2008-
physical-activity-guidelines) in 2008, followed in 2013 by the Physical 
Activity Guidelines for Americans Midcourse Report: Strategies to 
Increase Physical Activity Among Youth (https://health.gov/our-work/
physical-activity/previous-guidelines/2013-midcourse-report). The 
current version--the second edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines 
for Americans--was released in 2018. A midcourse report for this 
iteration will be released in June 2023, focused on strategies to 
increase physical activity among older adults.

    Examples of HHS efforts to implement the physical activity 
guidelines for Americans:

        1.  Move Your Way Campaign: The HHS Office of Disease 
        Prevention and Health Promotion developed the Move Your Way 
        (https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/move-
        your-way-community-resources) campaign to promote 
        recommendations from the second edition of the Physical 
        Activity Guidelines for Americans. Rather than a one-size-fits-
        all approach, Move Your Way emphasizes personalized, practical 
        strategies that people can use to fit more activity into their 
        busy lives, while clearly communicating the amount and types of 
        physical activity Americans need to stay healthy. The campaign 
        includes a partner toolkit with materials in English and 
        Spanish to promote the benefits of physical activity among a 
        wide variety of audiences.

        2.  National Youth Sports Strategy (NYSS): According to the 
        Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, youth ages 6 to 17 
        years need at least 60 minutes a day of moderate-to-vigorous 
        physical activity. Playing sports is one way youth can get the 
        physical activity they need. Sports also provide opportunities 
        for youth to experience the connection between effort and 
        success, and may enhance their academic, economic, social, and 
        health prospects.

    In 2019, ODPHP launched the National Youth Sports Strategy (NYSS, 
https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/national-youth-
sports-strategy/about-national-youth-sports-strategy) with the goal of 
uniting the U.S. youth sports culture around a shared vision: that one 
day, all youth will have the opportunity, motivation, and access to 
play sports. The Strategy is based on research and best practices from 
the scientific community and successful youth sports programs across 
the United States. It offers actionable ideas for parents, coaches, 
organizations, communities, and policymakers to support youth sports 
participation for all.

    Following the release of the NYSS, the Office of Disease Prevention 
and Health Promotion (ODPHP) created the NYSS Champions program as a 
way to recognize organizations that promote youth sports in their 
communities and help achieve the NYSS vision: that one day, all youth 
will have the opportunity, motivation, and access to play sports.

        3.  Active People, Healthy Nation<SUP>SM</SUP>: Active People, 
        Healthy Nation (https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/
        activepeoplehealthynation/about-active-people-healthy-
        nation.html) is a national initiative led by CDC to help 27 
        million Americans become more physically active by 2027. To 
        achieve this goal, CDC has created tools for action (https://
        www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/activepeoplehealthynation/
        everyone-can-be-involved/index.html) so that communities can 
        implement evidence-based strategies to increase opportunity for 
        greater physical activity across a variety of sectors and 
        settings.

    The NIH Office of Nutrition Research (ONR) is leading a cross-
government initiative on Food is Medicine research, which would 
integrate nutrition science and health care. Through this initiative, 
supported by funding requested in the FY 2024 President's budget, 
healthy eating and lifestyle changes to reduce the burden of diet-
related chronic diseases, including diabetes and obesity, which are 
some of the most deadly and costly in this country, will be emphasized. 
ONR has developed a comprehensive Food is Medicine Networks or Centers 
of Excellence program that aims to support clinical nutrition research 
on the effectiveness of increasing attention to healthy diets and 
lifestyles within the medical enterprise. It aims to expand clinical 
nutrition science and lifestyle medicine training in medical school 
curricula and across health professions. Working in partnership with 
other Federal agencies, these NIH Networks or Centers of Excellence 
will aim to develop the evidence-base and identify the most effective 
approaches to healthy eating and lifestyle medicine to both prevent and 
treat diet-related chronic diseases.
              ``inflation reduction act'' impact on cancer
    Question. The administration, including the President himself 
during his State of the Union speech, has been touting the Cancer 
Moonshot initiative and the goal to ``cut cancer death rates in half in 
the next 25 years.'' Oklahoma has a state-of-the-art NCI-designated 
cancer research and treatment facility.

    However, I am wondering how the administration is taking into 
account its own actions in actually keeping itself from reaching its 
own goals? As I am sure you have seen, several drug manufacturers have 
noted that they will likely be forced to remove drugs, nearly all of 
them mentioning cancer drugs specifically, from production because of 
the impacts of the IRA drug price setting policies. So at the same 
time, the administration is claiming they are going to cure cancer, the 
companies that actually do the R&D on possible cancer cures, are saying 
that they are having to pull back because of a policy that same 
administration supported.

    How many more tax-payer dollars will have to be spent to make up 
for the cancer treatments that the private industry was already working 
on?

    Answer. FDA is not involved in drug pricing, nor does it control 
the business decisions made by pharmaceutical companies. We will 
continue to work with the pharmaceutical industry to expedite the 
development of cancer products through our expedited programs and 
Oncology Center of Excellence regulatory review pilots.

    Question. How much faster could cancer treatments that were already 
in the pipeline get to patients if their manufacturers were 
incentivized to produce them instead of if they are disincentivized as 
they are now?

    Answer. FDA is committed to working with all drug stakeholders 
including the pharmaceutical industry to modernize evidence generation 
throughout all phases of development and use FDA expedited programs to 
speed access and approval of products to diagnose and treat patients 
with cancer.
                              alzheimer's
    Question. One in three seniors die from Alzheimer's or a related 
form of dementia. Bipartisan groups of members in Congress have written 
to the administration about concerns over the CMS National Coverage 
Determination (NCD) policy and its impact on access to Alzheimer's 
therapeutics and diagnostics. This new class of Alzheimer's treatments 
gives families hope that they will have more quality time with their 
loved ones before the disease takes hold. Since then, CMS has declined 
to open the NCD to increase access for patients and families in need.

    Why is your agency treating patients with Alzheimer's differently 
than others with life-threatening conditions?

    What gives CMS more authority than the FDA to decide if a drug is 
safe and effective?

    Answer. Alzheimer's disease is a devastating illness that affects 
millions of Americans and their families. CMS is committed to helping 
people get timely access to treatments and improving care for people 
with Alzheimer's disease and their families. CMS has a responsibility 
to ensure that people with Medicare have appropriate access to 
therapies that are reasonable and necessary for use in the Medicare 
population.

    The FDA performs a vital and an important role. CMS recognizes the 
important and related--but different--roles of the respective agencies. 
The FDA determines whether to approve a new medical product based on a 
careful evaluation of the available data and a determination that the 
medical product is safe and effective for its intended use. CMS 
conducts its own independent review to determine whether an item or 
service is reasonable and necessary for use in the Medicare population 
and should be covered nationally by Medicare.
                             nursing homes
    Question. Recently, CMS has suggested placing some additional 
requirements on nursing homes with the stated goal of increasing 
patient safety, including the implementation of Federal staffing ratio 
requirements. Most States have their own staff ratios to account for 
their individual populations and what needs and workforce looks like in 
their State. While we have the same goal of helping nursing homes keep 
patients safe, Federal standardized staff requirements will not help 
quality of care. In fact, it may actually decrease it by causing some 
facilities to close their doors. SNFs in rural Oklahoma are already 
caring for a large variety of patients, both with long term and short 
term needs--sometimes because they are one of the only Medicaid 
providers in the area. By placing Federal requirements on a system that 
is not one-size-fits-all, you are actually hurting the most vulnerable 
patients in the system.

    What type of real stakeholder engagement has CMS engaged in to 
create proposals like the Federal staffing requirement, besides opening 
a comment period in the Federal Register?

    Were nursing home workers and patients in rural America taken into 
consideration when crafting this policy? What did outreach to this 
population specifically look like?

    Why did the administration choose to not extend its COVID Public 
Health Emergency policy which allowed nursing homes to train Temporary 
Nurse Aides (TNAs) and allow for extra time for those TNAs to acquire 
full training certification?

    Answer. Understaffing continues to be a concern despite existing 
requirements. For that reason, CMS believes it essential to patient 
safety that it conduct new rulemaking to propose more specific, 
detailed, and quantitative minimum staffing requirements.

    CMS initially published a Request for Information (RFI) soliciting 
public comments on minimum nursing home staffing requirements in April 
2022, within the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Skilled Nursing Facility 
Prospective Payment System Proposed Rule. CMS received over 3,000 
comments from a variety of interested parties including advocacy 
groups; long-term care ombudsmen; industry associations (providers); 
labor unions and organizations; nursing home staff and administrators; 
industry experts and other researchers; family members; and caretakers 
of nursing home residents. The vast majority of comments received from 
members of the public who identified themselves as family members or 
caretakers of residents living in nursing homes voiced concerns related 
to residents not receiving adequate care because of chronic 
understaffing in facilities. Multiple commenters stated that residents 
can go entire shifts without receiving toileting assistance, leading to 
falls or increased presence of pressure ulcers. One commenter, whose 
parents live in a nursing home, noted that they visit their parents on 
a daily basis to ensure the provision of quality care and reported that 
staff in the facility have stated that they are overworked and 
understaffed.

    The feedback received has and will be used to inform the research 
study design for the mixed methods study that CMS is conducting with 
qualitative and quantitative elements to help to inform the minimum 
staffing proposed requirements. CMS seeks to consider all feedback from 
the RFI responses, listening sessions, and mixed methods study in 
crafting proposals for minimum direct care staffing requirements in 
nursing homes. We expect to propose such requirements to advance the 
public's interest in safe, quality care for residents in a 2023 
rulemaking. CMS intends to seek workable, implementable solutions that 
ensure safe, quality care for residents. CMS appreciates the interest 
shown by so many stakeholders to date and looks forward to robust 
response from stakeholders when the proposed rule is issued.
                             inflation caps
    Question. Your budget calls for the expansion of several Inflation 
Reduction Act policies from Medicare to the private market, one of 
which is inflation caps on drug prices. I have been arguing for several 
years at this point about the negative repercussions from placing 
inflationary caps on drug prices--namely how they will almost surely 
incentivize companies to launch their drugs at much higher prices than 
they otherwise would have. Even CBO agrees--they said, ``the inflation-
rebate and negotiation provisions would increase the launch prices for 
drugs that are not yet on the market relative to what such prices would 
be otherwise.''

    Why does HHS continue to move forward with the expansion of 
policies that are proven to increase drug prices when the stated goal 
is to decrease prices?

    Answer. The Inflation Reduction Act requires manufacturers to pay 
rebates to Medicare when drug prices for certain rebatable Medicare 
Part B or Part D drugs rise at a rate that is faster than the rate of 
inflation. The budget includes a proposal to revise the formula to 
calculate these rebates beyond Medicare utilization to include drug 
units used by commercial plans. Doing so would provide additional 
savings while discouraging manufacturers from raising drug prices for 
commercial coverage including employer-sponsored plans, marketplace 
plans, and other individual and group market plans.

    CMS cannot predict behavioral changes by drug manufacturers in 
response to implementation of the inflation rebates for Part B and D 
drugs. Our understanding is that manufacturers typically set their 
drugs' launch prices to be competitive with other therapeutic and non-
therapeutic competitors.
                ``not scorable'' sections in the budget
    Question. In going through the HHS budget in brief, I noticed 
several instances that policy proposals are followed by ``[Not 
Scorable].'' Would you be able to explain to me what that means to you? 
Most of the time a section that ends in ``not scorable'' is filled with 
promises of increased access to certain health services, meaning that 
it is likely that additional resources are to be spent. I feel certain 
that each of your proposed policies will surely increase Federal 
spending in one way or another, meaning that they would ``score.''

    Are the proposed and ``not scorable'' policies simply not detailed 
enough to be able to receive full cost information or is HHS assuming 
that these policies will not cost the Federal Government additional 
funds? What measures are used to make such assumptions?

    Answer. All proposals in the FY 2024 President's budget reflect the 
official legislative agenda of the Biden administration. For the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Office of the 
Actuary provides official estimates for legislative proposals affecting 
Medicare, Medicaid, and other CMS programs. A proposal may not be 
scorable due to multiple factors, in limited circumstances. For 
example, the evidence supporting the policy may indicate a range of 
potential effects on spending, both direct and indirect, that make it 
difficult to provide a pinpoint estimate. In other instances, the 
proposal leaves certain implementation details for future development 
to account for stakeholder and other valuable input on how it would be 
carried out, which also affects the ability to provide a pinpoint 
estimate at the time of Budget publication.

    The proposals in the FY 2024 President's budget each improve these 
vital programs. The administration stands ready to work with Congress 
on refinements and additional details that will support enactment.
           ruling in fda v. alliance for hippocratic medicine
    Question. As you know, last week, the U.S. District Court for the 
Northern District of Texas held a hearing in the case FDA v. Alliance 
for Hippocratic Medicine, which challenges the FDA's approval and 
deregulation of a chemical abortion drug, mifepristone. Although a 
decision has not been issued in that case yet, there have been some 
calls for the FDA to ignore an injunction or a decision that would 
restrict access to mifeprex while the litigation continues, should that 
occur, and continue to distribute chemical abortion drugs regardless of 
the Federal court's decision.

    If a decision is issued in that case and that decision restricts 
the distribution of chemical abortion drugs in any way, will you ensure 
HHS's compliance with the decision of the Federal district court?

    Answer. The FDA has determined that mifepristone is safe and 
effective for medical termination of early pregnancy and we continue to 
believe that patients should have access to FDA-approved medications 
that FDA has determined to be safe and effective for their intended 
uses. We stand by FDA's approval of mifepristone and will continue to 
do everything we can to prevail in the courts. That said, HHS will 
comply with all court orders.
                      federal funding for abortion
    Question. I'm concerned by the priority HHS seems to be placing on 
the taking of unborn human life, as opposed to providing actual health 
care to save lives. Once again, the President's FY 2024 budget proposes 
to eliminate the longstanding Hyde Amendment. Since it first became law 
in 1976, the Hyde Amendment has saved over 2.4 million lives. The law 
has been renewed every year since 1976 on a bipartisan basis, and 
nearly 60 percent of Americans agree that taxpayer dollars should not 
be used to fund abortion.

    Assuming that Congress continues to maintain the Hyde Amendment, 
like it has done for the last 47 years, will you commit to ensuring 
that zero Federal dollars are used for elective abortion?

    Answer. As HHS Secretary, my role is to implement the law. The 
Department will follow all applicable laws as they relate to abortion 
and any other issue.
                            title x funding
    Question. In addition to Hyde, funding for the title X family 
planning program, which under current regulation continues to fund 
abortion-providers like Planned Parenthood, increased to by $225 
million--from $286 million to $512 million.

    Will you ensure that any amount appropriated by Congress to title X 
is not used for abortion, consistent with Federal law prohibiting title 
X dollars from being used for abortion? Considering title X dollars are 
awarded to abortion providers, how will you ensure compliance with the 
law?

    Answer. The Department will follow all applicable laws as they 
relate to abortion and any other issue. Title X recipients are required 
to ensure that non-title X abortion activities are separate and 
distinct from title X project activities. Where recipients conduct 
abortion activities, the recipient must ensure that the title X-
supported project is separate and distinguishable from those other 
activities. OPA monitors title X recipient compliance by conducting 
ongoing monitoring calls and recipient correspondence, reviewing 
recipient progress reports and continuation applications.
                         conscience protections
    Question. We have had a number of conversations on protecting 
conscience rights of individuals. Since 2004, Congress has continued to 
include language on annual funding bills that prohibits funding to 
entities that discriminate against institutions or individuals that do 
not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions. 
Although you once referred to enforcement of this law as ``illegal,'' 
the President's budget includes the rider. Notably, the Proposed Rule 
recently issued by HHS significantly walks back much of the clarity and 
standards for implementation and enforcement of both the Weldon 
Amendment and other conscience protection laws enacted by Congress that 
the 2019 rule provided.

    How much involvement did you have with issuing the rule? What steps 
were taken to ensure the rule was issued manner free of conflicts of 
interest?

    Answer. HHS met with many faith-based leaders and stakeholders to 
help inform work on this rule. In 2019, HHS issued a regulation that 
provided broad definitions, created new compliance regulations, and 
created a new enforcement mechanism for a number of statutes related to 
the conscience rights of certain federally funded health-care entities 
and providers. This regulation was held unlawful by three Federal 
district courts. In light of these court decisions, and consistent with 
the administration's commitment to safeguard the rights of Federal 
conscience and religious nondiscrimination while also protecting access 
to reproductive health care, HHS issued a proposed rule to partially 
rescind the provisions of this rule that were deemed illegal in Federal 
court, while reinforcing other processes previously in place for the 
handling of conscience and religious freedom complaints. The proposed 
rule issued in 2022 notably maintains provisions from the 2019 rule 
issued by the Trump administration that provided clarity and standards 
for enforcement of the Weldon Amendment, among the conscience statutes 
the Department enforces.

    Question. Recently, HHS Office for Civil Rights issued a 
reorganization that appears to dissolve the Conscience and Religious 
Freedom Division, among other divisions, and enfold that work into 
separate, broader divisions.

    What impact do you expect this reorganization will have on 
investigating and enforcing conscience protection laws?

    Answer. HHS expects this reorganization to have a positive impact 
on our enforcement of conscience protection laws. In fact, the former 
Deputy Director of the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division, Luis 
Perez, is now the Deputy Director of the newly formed Enforcement 
Division. In this role, he will be able to help OCR strategically carry 
out enforcement activities and prioritize its needs, which importantly 
includes enforcing Federal conscience protections. Further, the 2022 
conscience proposed rule that OCR published proposed maintaining all of 
the conscience statutes that were previously delegated to OCR for 
enforcement.

    Question. What impact do you expect this reorganization will have 
on investigating and enforcing other civil rights laws, including 
protections for individuals with disabilities?

    Answer. HHS expects the reorganization to have a positive impact on 
our enforcement of disability laws and other civil rights laws. The 
former Deputy Director of the Conscience and Religious Freedom 
Division, Luis Perez, is now the Deputy Director of the newly formed 
Enforcement Division. He is a trained lawyer and litigator and will 
help improve OCR's enforcement work, bring forward high impact matters 
that help people, and help OCR enforce regulations including the HIPAA 
Security Rule, which is an issue of national security.

    Question. There has been much media coverage about the State of 
California threatening to cut out health-care entities from partnership 
with the State because they are not providing abortions either in 
California or in other States, based on the laws in those areas or 
Federal law, such as prohibitions on mailing chemical abortion drugs.

    Has HHS OCR initiated an investigation into whether such 
discrimination would violate the Weldon amendment?

    Answer. OCR generally does not confirm or deny pending 
investigations to protect the integrity of the investigation and work.
                         new york times report
    Question. During the hearing, you testified that you were unaware 
of the reporting that HHS could not locate at least 85,000 
unaccompanied minors through their safety and well-being calls. This 
number was reported in The New York Times, and the Departments of Labor 
and Health and Human Services--within 2 days of this number being 
reported--announced that they would be taking additional labor 
enforcement efforts to ensure that unaccompanied minors are labor 
trafficked.

    Your Department took action in response to The New York Times 
report, and you provided a statement in a joint DOL and HHS press 
release on the matter.

    Since February 23, 2023, were you briefed on The New York Times 
report (Hannah Dreier, ``Alone and Exploited, Migrant Children Work 
Brutal Jobs Across the U.S.'', New York Times, February 25, 2023, 
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/25/us/unaccompanied-migrant-child-
workers-exploitation.html)? Please answer ``yes'' or ``no.''

    If yes, did you receive any briefing regarding this matter in your 
prep materials for this hearing? Please answer ``yes'' or ``no.''

    Did you receive any briefings on the labor trafficking initiative 
the Biden administration announced on February 27, 2023, either prior 
to or subsequent to the rollout? Please answer ``yes'' or ``no.''

    Did you receive any information on this labor trafficking 
initiative in your prep materials for this hearing? Please answer 
''yes'' or ``no.''

    If you did receive information regarding The New York Times report 
or the labor trafficking initiative, please explain to the committee 
why you testified that you were unaware that HHS could not locate the 
reported 85,000 unaccompanied minors.

    Answer. The February 23, 2023, New York Times article that you 
reference demonstrated the terrible ways that employers are exploiting 
the economic situation that many children and families in the United 
States find themselves in, including children who have previously been 
in ORR care. HHS takes the issue of child labor very seriously. To that 
end, we are committed to taking additional action to educate children 
and our providers about child labor exploitation, ensure sponsors 
understand the hazards of child labor, and collaborate with the 
Department of Labor to do everything we can to reduce the likelihood 
that children will end up in a situation where they are exploited. Our 
principal responsibility is to care for unaccompanied children while 
they are in our custody, and then make sure we can place the child to a 
safe, vetted sponsor. HHS looks forward to partnering with Congress to 
advance the shared mission of protecting children and continue to 
strengthen the quality and depth of services we offer.

    The Department does not believe it is accurate to say that 85,000 
children are lost. ORR's custodial authority ends when a child is 
released from ORR care. Per ORR policy, care providers must make at 
least three safety and well-being calls to speak with the child and the 
sponsor individually. Children and sponsors are not required to answer 
these calls, and some do not. It is important to note that many sponsor 
families may not answer a call from an unknown phone number or may 
choose not to answer a call for a variety of reasons. Despite the 
voluntary nature of the child's and sponsor's participation in safety 
and well-being calls, in FY 2022, ORR care providers made contact with 
either the child, the sponsor, or both in more than 81 percent of 
households.
                        memorandum of agreement
    Question. In 2018, HHS and DHS entered into a memorandum of 
agreement to, in part, require ICE to share with HHS information 
contained in ICE databases on the criminal and immigration histories of 
potential sponsors and all adult members in sponsor households. The 
intent of this MOA was to allow for HHS use additional information to 
make more complete suitability determinations prior to placing a child 
with an adult sponsor.

    The Biden administration terminated this agreement and waived 
background check requirements for household members living with 
prospective sponsors. At the time, the Biden administration argued that 
the old MOA ``undermined the interests of a child'' and that the new 
MOA ``promotes the safe and timely transfer of children.''

    In light of the recent New York Times story (Hannah Dreier, ``Alone 
and Exploited, Migrant Children Work Brutal Jobs Across the U.S.'', New 
York Times, February 25, 2023, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/25/us/
unaccompanied-migrant-child-workers-exploitation.html), will you be 
updating your guidance regarding the vetting of sponsors? Please answer 
``yes'' or ``no.''

    If no, why not?

    Answer. In June 2018, ORR, ICE, and CBP entered into an MOA that 
set forth the expectations of the parties as they pertained to sharing 
information about unaccompanied children at the time of referral from 
ICE or CBP to ORR, while in the care and custody of ORR, including 
during the vetting of potential sponsors, and upon release from ORR 
care and custody. Section V of the 2018 MOA specified that ORR would 
transmit sponsor fingerprints to ICE as part of its sponsor assessment 
process. DHS would then perform criminal and immigration status checks 
for all sponsor categories and provide the results to ORR prior to a 
child's release from care. Prior to the 2018 MOA, ORR already 
transmitted sponsor and other required subjects' fingerprints to the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for adjudication in accordance 
with its policies and procedures. This made the ICE biometric 
background checks duplicative of ORR's FBI checks.

    In late 2018, ORR reviewed the effects of the ICE biometric 
background checks required under the MOA. The review assessed whether 
they yielded any new information that enabled ORR to identify child 
welfare risks that it would not have found under its standard policies, 
including the FBI fingerprint background checks that were already 
formerly part of ORR's vetting process for sponsors who were not 
previously the child's primary caregiver. ORR also examined whether a 
correlation existed between the ICE biometric background checks and a 
child's length of stay in ORR care. ORR determined that none of the 
information gleaned from duplicative ICE biometric background checks 
yielded automatic sponsor disqualification or additional child safety 
and welfare concerns, and in fact, had a negative influence on sponsors 
coming forward to take custody of a child. Moreover, the sheer number 
of sponsors and their household members requiring ICE biometric checks 
resulted in lengthier time in care for children in ORR custody while 
background check requests surged, creating long wait times to schedule 
fingerprint appointments, and for those checks to be adjudicated. For 
instance, median length of care for unaccompanied children discharged 
to Category 1 sponsors increased from 20 days to 73 days between 
January 5, 2018, and July 7, 2018. Based on its child welfare 
expertise, ORR assessed that the ICE fingerprint checks were not in the 
best interests of unaccompanied children in care.

    In light of these findings, between December 2018 and June 2019, 
ORR issued four operational directives that updated its background 
checks processes to be consistent with pre-MOA policies. FBI 
fingerprint background checks would only be required for all sponsor 
categories and adult household members in cases where there were risks 
to the child, the child was especially vulnerable, and the case was 
being referred for a home study. Without such instances, Category 1 
sponsors and Category 2A sponsors no longer required biometric-based 
background checks. Lastly, close adult relative sponsors in Category 2 
were broken into sub-classes of Category 2A and 2B, which affected 
background check requirements for each. FBI fingerprint background 
checks were and still are required for all Category 2B sponsors.

    In March 2021, ORR formally rescinded the 2018 MOA. ORR, ICE, and 
CBP signed a replacement MOA on consultation and information-sharing 
policies. Its terms were the same as the 2018 version apart from the 
removal of section V as it related to ORR sharing information with ICE. 
ORR and DHS ensured that the information sharing provisions were 
relevant to the safe and timely placement and transfer of children to 
ORR care and ORR's discharge process.

    ORR is dedicated to ensuring the safety and well-being of children 
in its care from the moment they enter its custody, to when they are 
safely placed with a vetted sponsor. ORR also understands the 
importance of providing children and their sponsors with the PRS tools 
and resources necessary to promote their safety. ORR provides PRS to 
facilitate a continuum of care to unaccompanied children who would 
benefit from ongoing assistance and to help them transition into their 
new communities. PRS include timely referrals and connection to 
community resources, as well as intensive services in cases where 
support is needed to address a child's specific needs. These referral 
and case management services are offered by a network of ORR-funded 
non-profit providers across the United States. ORR has doubled the rate 
of the total number of cases of PRS worked on in FY 2021 to more than 
40 percent in FY 2022--all while receiving an unprecedented number of 
referrals beginning in Calendar Year 2021. ORR continues to build PRS 
capacity and is on track to provide nearly 50 percent of children 
released from ORR care with PRS in CY 2023. These services are 
fundamental in helping children and their sponsors establish resiliency 
and access resources in their communities.

    In order to fulfill its mission, ORR continuously evaluates its 
unification policies and procedures to ensure that ORR is pursuing the 
best interest of each child. Additionally, ORR conducted an audit of 
the UC Program's current sponsor vetting requirements for potential 
sponsors who have previously sponsored unaccompanied children to make 
quality improvements where deemed appropriate without unnecessarily 
keeping children in government-funded, congregate care settings. ORR 
looks forwards to sharing the findings of the audit with the committee.

    Question. Do you believe that a child, who has encountered 
significant trauma during his or her journey to the border, should be 
placed with unvetted sponsors? Please answer ``yes'' or ``no.''

    Answer. No. Every child discharged from ORR care is vetted in 
compliance with statute and in adherence to ORR's policies and 
procedures. The safety and well-being of an unaccompanied child is the 
primary factor in ORR release decisions. ORR's legal responsibility to 
provide for the care and custody of unaccompanied children includes 
robust sponsor vetting. Safe and timely release of unaccompanied 
children to vetted sponsors is a multilayered process that involves the 
identification of a sponsor, which is typically a parent or other 
family member. The sponsor must then complete a robust screening 
process that includes a sponsor application, interviews, sponsor 
suitability assessments and reviews of supporting documentation, 
background checks, and in some cases as required by ORR UC Program 
Policy Guide section 2.4 (https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/
unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-2#2.4), home 
studies prior to release and PRS.

    Question. Does the Department believe that it should vet every 
adult individual who lives in a sponsor's household? Why or why not?

    Answer. Pursuant to the TVPRA, ORR conducts background checks on 
every sponsor to determine whether the proposed release is safe and the 
sponsor can provide for the child's physical and mental well-being. The 
process includes a public records background check of criminal history 
and sex offender registry databases. Under current policy, if a public 
records check reveals possible disqualifying factors under ORR UC 
Program Policy Guide section 2.7.4 (https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/
resource/children-entering-the-united-states-unaccompanied-section-
2#2.7.4)--such as a documented risk to the safety of the unaccompanied 
child, the child is especially vulnerable, or the case is being 
referred for a home study--parents and legal guardians (also known as 
Category 1 sponsors) and non-parent immediate family relatives (or 
Category 2A sponsors) are fingerprinted, and the information is 
submitted to the FBI prior to the child's release from ORR custody. All 
other potential sponsors, like extended family members (Category 2B 
sponsors) or unrelated sponsors and distant relatives (Category 3), are 
fingerprinted and their information is submitted to the FBI for a 
criminal history background check prior to a child's release from ORR 
care. See ORR UC Program Policy Guide section 2.2.1 (https://
www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-
policy-guide-section-2#2.2.1).

    In addition to verifying a sponsor's identity through background 
checks, ORR conducts a thorough assessment of potential sponsors' 
suitability in accordance with its statutory responsibilities. ORR's 
policies with respect to the release process are described in its 
online UC Program Policy Guide section 2 (https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/
policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-2) 
and in Field Guidance 10 (https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/
documents/orr/FG-
10%20Expedited%20Release%20for%20Eligible%20Category%201%20Cases%202021
%2003%2022.pdf) and 11 (https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/
documents/orr/FG-
11%20Temporary%20Waiver%20of%20Background%20Check%20Require
ments%202021%2003%2031.pdf). Requirements include proof of the sponsor-
child relationship, as well as the sponsor's ability to provide 
protection from abuse, abandonment, neglect, and other harm. ORR and 
care provider staff also evaluate a child's risk and resiliency factors 
and their unique needs such as medical conditions or past experiences 
in home country to determine a release decision based on child welfare 
principles. These sponsor suitability assessments give ORR, through its 
Federal Field Specialists, case managers, and field staff, the 
individual decision-making and operational flexibility necessary to 
make case-by-case determinations of what is in the child's best 
interest and whether certain potential sponsors that are not Category 
2B and 3 sponsors and adult household members needed to be 
fingerprinted. Fingerprint background checks are still required for all 
Category 2B and 3 sponsors.

    In some cases, ORR also requires adult household members to undergo 
a background check search of State child abuse and neglect (CA/N) 
registries maintained by individual States. ORR routinely relies on its 
State partner agencies to facilitate and adjudicate CA/N checks. States 
independently own and operate their respective CA/N registry databases 
and provide relevant information upon request to the agencies that ask 
for them. As a result, timely CA/N check adjudication varies widely, 
and ORR care providers' ability to vet every adult household member 
with an additional check can depend on whether a particular State 
partner can promptly facilitate the CA/N check without compromising 
timely unification of children with their sponsors.

    The Flores Settlement Agreement requires that children be released 
from ORR care without unnecessary delay and to make prompt and 
continuous efforts toward unification and the release of the child. 
Once a sponsor is thoroughly vetted, due process protections entitle a 
suitable sponsor to take custody of the unaccompanied child without 
undue delay or procedural hurdles in line with child welfare best 
practices. However, safety remains at the forefront of ORR's policies 
and procedures, so without sacrificing safe and effective sponsor 
vetting procedures, Case Managers also obtain information on adult 
household members for purposes of such things as alternate caregiver 
plans to ensure that the child is cared for if the sponsor ever becomes 
unavailable. Case Managers are also trained to identify any safety 
risks or vulnerability flags that would necessitate additional 
background checks on adult household members, but that does not mean, 
as a threshold matter, that children are unsafe should a sponsor live 
with adult household members. Children experience better educational, 
social, developmental, and health outcomes when they are surrounded by 
familiar support systems that can often include extended family and 
other individuals living within the same household, and have access to 
comprehensive community resources, as opposed to being in more 
restrictive, unfamiliar congregate care settings where they are more 
likely to feel lonely, isolated, and confused about their 
circumstances.

                Questions Submitted by Hon. Steve Daines
      drug price negotiation program and small molecule innovation
    Question. The recent, partisan Inflation Reduction Act created the 
Medicare Drug Negotiation Program, granting the HHS Secretary the 
ability to negotiate drug prices in Medicare-covered drugs. The 
negotiation process allows for small molecule drugs that are approved 
as NDAs to become eligible for negotiation at 7 years after they 
receive FDA approval, whereas biologics become eligible at 11 years.

    This arrangement is questionable in light of the fact that small 
molecule medicines accounted for a majority of new, life-saving 
medicines and cures approved by the FDA in recent years. This drug 
negotiation program would appear to stunt and disadvantage the 
development of small molecule medicines which, notably, much of the 
research and development for new oncology medicines is on small 
molecules.

    Is the administration concerned that the negotiation program as 
currently designed will disadvantage or deter small molecule 
advancements?

    Given the promise shown for small molecules in the oncology space, 
is the administration concerned that the negotiation program could 
severely undermine the administration's own Cancer Moonshot initiative?

    Small molecule drugs are more often dispensed at the pharmacy 
counter, or sent to patients through mail orders, whereas biologics are 
often physician-administered. Has HHS considered the impact of the drug 
price negotiation program favoring biologics over small molecules in 
light of the ongoing provider shortages across the country, especially 
in more rural States like Montana?

    How does the Department expect this will impact patient access to 
medicines?

    What analysis has the Department done to assess this dynamic?

    Many small molecule medicines have the potential to address more 
than one disease or treat broader patient populations, perhaps in 
earlier lines of therapy, than solely the initial diseases and 
populations approved at launch. Do you think CMS has the authority to 
begin the ``negotiation'' eligibility clock upon the receipt of an 
indication for a subsequent indication, after having received an orphan 
drug negotiation exception for previous indication? Why or why not?

    Answer. CMS supports continued drug innovation and believes it is 
vitally important that beneficiaries have access to innovative new 
therapies. The statute provides that drugs that have been approved by 
the FDA for at least 7 years, or biologicals that have been licensed by 
the FDA for at least 11 years, are eligible for negotiation. Any drugs 
or biologicals selected for negotiation will have been on the market 
for quite some time.

    The law requires CMS to exclude certain orphan drugs approved or 
licensed when identifying qualifying single source drugs, referred to 
as the orphan drug exclusion. To be considered for the orphan drug 
exclusion, the drug or biological product must: (1) be designated as a 
drug for only one rare disease or condition by the FDA; and (2) be 
approved by the FDA only for one or more indications within such 
designated rare disease or condition. As noted in the initial guidance, 
we are considering whether there are additional actions CMS can take in 
its implementation of the Negotiation Program to best support orphan 
drug development.

    CMS has been regularly engaging with members of the public to get 
their feedback so that we are implementing the Negotiation Program in a 
thoughtful way that both improves drug affordability and accessibility 
for people with Medicare and supports innovation. We plan to get public 
input throughout the implementation of the Negotiation Program to make 
sure that we know what is occurring in the market.

                                 ______
                                 
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young
            medicare coverage for innovative medical devices
    Question. The Fall 2022 HHS Unified Agenda regulatory calendar 
currently lists April 2023 as the target date for CMS to release the 
Transitional Coverage for Emerging Technologies (TCET) proposed rule, 
which would provide transitional Medicare coverage for new medical 
technologies.

    Can you assure us that CMS will issue the TCET proposed rule by 
April 2023, particularly given that this rule was initially scheduled 
for release in 2022, and originally discussed over 2 years ago when the 
Medicare Coverage for Innovative Technology (MCIT) rule was repealed?

    CMS indicated in the Medicare Coverage for Innovative Technology 
(MCIT) repeal rule that ``breakthrough'' designation from the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) alone would not necessarily result in a 
technology having eligibility to undergo the TCET process.

    Please describe the technologies CMS is considering could be 
potentially eligible for coverage under the TCET.

    How complex would eligible devices need to be? Would follow-on 
devices potentially be eligible for Medicare coverage under the TCET?

    Answer. CMS remains committed to expanding access to health-care 
coverage and services, including new, innovative treatments when they 
are safe and appropriate. CMS rescinded the Medicare Coverage of 
Innovative Technology and Definition of ``Reasonable and Necessary'' 
(MCIT/R&N) Final Rule because of concerns that the provisions in the 
Final Rule may not have been sufficient to protect Medicare patients. 
By rescinding this rule, CMS will take action to better address those 
safety concerns in the future.

    Improving and modernizing the Medicare coverage process continues 
to be a priority, and we remain committed to providing stakeholders 
with more transparent and predictable coverage pathways. CMS is working 
as quickly as possible to advance multiple coverage process 
improvements that provide an appropriate balance of access to new 
technologies with necessary patient protections. As part of this 
effort, CMS has conducted several listening sessions to learn about 
stakeholders' most pressing challenges and to receive feedback from 
stakeholders about which coverage process improvements would be most 
valuable.

    CMS intends to explore coverage process improvements that will 
enhance access to innovative and beneficial medical devices in a way 
that will better suit the health-care needs of people with Medicare. 
This will also help to establish a process in which the Medicare 
program covers new technologies on the basis of scientifically sound 
clinical evidence, with appropriate health and safety protections in 
place for the Medicare population. HHS looks forward to working with 
you and hearing your feedback as we move forward with these efforts.
                           medicare advantage
    Question. CMS is considering policy to eliminate over 2,200 codes, 
many of which are used to diagnose and treat chronic diseases commonly 
experienced by low-
income seniors and people with disabilities, including depression, 
vascular conditions, and heart disease. The American Medical 
Association (AMA) and over 2 dozen patient disease groups have raised 
concerns about the elimination of these codes and asked for a delay in 
the implementation of this new model under further stakeholder 
engagement is conducted.

    Have you conducted an analysis on how this proposal would directly 
impact providers and beneficiaries in each State and territory? Have 
you analyzed how this proposal will impact the national health-care 
workforce and physician shortage in each State and territory? Can you 
share this analysis?

    Will the administration provide assurances that the proposed policy 
changes will not lead to increased beneficiary costs or disruption for 
Medicare Advantage seniors in 2024?

    Answer. In February, CMS proposed routine technical updates to 
improve the accuracy of MA payments in the 2024 Advance Notice. The 
proposed adjustments in some codes help to ensure that the risk 
adjustment of MA payments better reflects a beneficiary's costs of 
care, which means MA plans serving beneficiaries with greater health-
care needs would receive appropriately higher payments. The proposed 
model updates do not impact coverage of Medicare services or 
requirements for MA plans to deliver covered services; rather, these 
proposed changes improve the accuracy of payments made to MA plans for 
covering care for enrollees.

    As required by law, CMS sought public comment on the CY 2024 
Advance Notice and will take this feedback into account when finalizing 
the Rate Announcement. CMS received a large number of comments in 
response to the CY 2024 Advance Notice and appreciates the commenters 
thoughts and input regarding payments under the MA program.
                     social determinants of health
    Question. The Social Determinants Accelerator Act would establish a 
Federal interagency council to better leverage existing programs and 
address the barriers to coordination between health and social services 
programs. The bill would also help States and localities to develop 
innovative strategies to address social determinants in their 
communities.

    Have you considered establishing some sort of commission or 
interagency council, like in the Social Determinants Accelerator Act, 
to address potential SDOH barriers?

    Answer. HHS agrees with the committee that addressing social 
determinants of health is critical for improving health and well-being. 
HHS is continuing our work with an intra-agency workgroup of multiple 
HHS agencies and is also engaging in a White House-led Interagency 
Policy Committee, which involves participation of multiple Federal 
agencies to develop whole-of-government approaches to addressing social 
determinants of health. A particular focus of the IPC's efforts has 
been identifying opportunities to support the development and 
sustainability of infrastructure needed to improve coordination of 
health and social care services at the local level.
                                medicaid
    Question. Last month, CMS released an Informational Bulletin 
titled, ``Health-Care-Related Taxes and Hold Harmless Arrangements 
Involving the Redistribution of Medicaid Payments'' which clarified 
CMS's position on the use of health-care-
related taxes as a permissible source of Medicaid funding.

    Can you discuss what prompted CMS to release this bulletin at this 
time?

    Does this bulletin reflect existing policy or is it a shift in 
policy?

    Can you confirm that the policies reflected in the bulletin will be 
directed and applied to all States?

    Answer. Recently, CMS has been approached by several States with 
questions regarding the statutory and regulatory requirements 
applicable to health-care-related taxes, including in connection with 
proposals to implement or renew Medicaid managed care State directed 
payments (SDPs). Many of these questions have focused on whether 
health-care-related tax arrangements involving the redistribution of 
Medicaid payments among providers subject to the tax would comply with 
the statutory and regulatory prohibition on hold harmless arrangements, 
as specified in section 1903(w)(1)(A)(iii) and (w)(4) of the Social 
Security Act (the Act) and implementing regulations.

    In response to these questions, in February 2023, CMS issued an 
informational bulletin reiterating Federal requirements concerning 
health-care-related taxes and hold harmless arrangements involving the 
redistribution of Medicaid payments. This guidance, which does not 
establish new policy, was issued as a reminder in response to questions 
received from several States about complying with this provision of 
law. CMS recognizes that health-care-related taxes often finance 
critical programs that pay for care provided to Medicaid beneficiaries 
and shore up the health care safety net, and it will continue to 
approve permissible health-care-related taxes that meet Federal 
requirements and remains committed to working with States.

                                 ______
                                 
                Questions Submitted by Hon. Thom Tillis
    Question. The President's budget requests an additional $100 
million for the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Tobacco 
Products to be paid for by extending user fees to manufacturers of 
electronic cigarettes. This is in addition to the over $700 million the 
FDA already receives from tobacco industry user fees on an annual 
basis. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009, 
legislation which you supported during your tenure in Congress, gave 
FDA the authority to regulate the tobacco industry. The act also 
intended such user fees facilitate regulatory pathways that evaluate 
alternative nicotine containing products and only those products 
determined to be less harmful than continued cigarette smoking could be 
sold in the marketplace.

    However, since the law was enacted, FDA has only authorized 23 
products or components of those products. Those authorizations were 
granted well after the 180-day statutory deadline and there are still 
literally hundreds of thousands of product applications pending at the 
agency.

    What assurances can you provide that these additional user fees 
will improve CTP's regulatory review process? Unlike the other Centers 
at the FDA that must achieve certain performance measures in order to 
receive industry user fees, CTP does not have such requirements. Should 
FDA take steps to align CTP with the other Centers, or should Congress 
act to help ensure CTP is operating more effectively?

    Answer. Since its inception, FDA has taken many actions to reduce 
tobacco-
related disease and death, including taking steps to prevent and reduce 
youth use of tobacco products, proposing tobacco product standards, 
reviewing applications before new tobacco products can be legally 
marketed, pursuing compliance and enforcement actions to hold companies 
accountable, and educating the public about the risks of tobacco 
products.

    Last summer, to strengthen FDA's tobacco program, FDA Commissioner 
Califf commissioned an external evaluation to be conducted by a panel 
facilitated by the Reagan-Udall Foundation (RUF). The panel was asked 
to assess the tobacco program's regulatory processes and agency 
operations relating to regulations and guidance, application review, 
compliance and enforcement, and communication with the public and other 
stakeholders. The evaluation was completed in December 2022, and the 
panel's report gave FDA helpful recommendations to build on CTP's 
existing foundation and continue to grow and mature the program. The 
RUF report included a specific recommendation for FDA to pursue 
securing user fees from each sector regulated by the Center, including, 
for example, Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems. FDA is committed to 
addressing all the recommendations outlined in the report, including 
developing and implementing a comprehensive 5-year strategic plan, 
which builds upon the foundation of CTP's previous strategic 
priorities. FDA is committed to being transparent about our key 
activities, which will ensure external stakeholders have a clear view 
of our plans.

    Your question raises concerns with the premarket application 
process and timeliness in reviewing applications. CTP has made 
important progress in reviewing Premarket Tobacco Applications (PMTA) 
for tobacco products. To date, FDA has received PMTAs for nearly 26 
million products, the vast majority of which are for e-cigarette 
products, and successfully completed review of 99 percent of them. This 
includes the applications for nearly 6.7 million products that were 
received by the September 9, 2020, court-ordered submission deadline 
(FDA has also completed review of 99 percent of those applications as 
well). FDA continues to review the remaining one percent of 
applications submitted by the September 9, 2020, deadline and is 
committed to completing this as quickly as possible while making sure 
final decisions are legally defensible and grounded in science.

    FDA acknowledges that there are opportunities to enhance the PMTA 
review process and has started developing a more efficient framework 
for high-quality tobacco product application reviews, which will, for 
example, improve review times. CTP's goals are to work internally and 
through engagement with external stakeholders to: better communicate 
scientific issues and review processes to support efficiency, 
effectiveness, and transparency; hire additional staff to enhance 
program management and implementation, including for application 
review; and increase internal communication to improve scientific 
engagement and deliberation. These efforts include activities such as 
resuming posting of scientific policy memos and reviewer guides, when 
appropriate, and communication through public events, such as workshops 
and listening sessions.

    FDA is committed to transparency and accountability and regularly 
reports to the public and Congress on premarket review progress.

    This important work cannot be done without sufficient resources. 
Currently, section 919 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) 
Act (21 U.S.C. 387s) authorizes FDA to assess user fees on tobacco 
products that fall within the following six product classes: cigars, 
pipe tobacco, cigarettes, snuff, chewing tobacco, and roll-your-own 
tobacco. Section 919 also authorizes the total amount of user fees FDA 
must assess and collect each year. For the first 10 years of the FDA 
tobacco program, the total amount of user fee collection increased each 
year; however, beginning in Fiscal Year 2019, the authorized amount of 
$712 million is fixed for each subsequent fiscal year and is not 
indexed to inflation. Further, section 919 of the FD&C Act does not 
provide FDA the authority to assess and collect user fees for ENDS, 
which includes e-cigarettes, and certain other deemed products. Thus, 
FDA has had to spend a significant portion of the $712 million in user 
fees it collects annually from the existing six product classes to 
properly regulate deemed products, especially ENDS.

    FDA's request to extend user fees to ENDS and deemed products would 
ensure a more equitable distribution of user fees across industry. In 
addition, the request for an additional $100 million in user fees, 
indexed to inflation, is in line with ensuring comprehensive regulation 
of the changing tobacco product marketplace. The additional $100 
million will enable FDA to expand much-needed activities in the 
critical areas of compliance and enforcement, product review, 
scientific research, regulation and guidance development, and public 
education.

    Question. Recently, the National Center for Advancing Translational 
Sciences (NCATS) and the Food and Drug Administration have publicly 
acknowledged an urgency to speed solutions for rare disease patients by 
developing treatments for more than one rare disease at a time. 
However, the limited nature of the Inflation Reduction Act's orphan 
drug exemption would discourage future research programs of existing 
rare disease therapies into additional orphan indications due to the 
risk of losing the exemption.

    Please detail how HHS plans to take a ``whole agency approach'' to 
ensure future research and development for patients with rare diseases 
and conditions without a treatment.

    Answer. FDA remains strongly committed to doing what we can via 
guidance for industry and stakeholder engagement activities to maintain 
and promote the robustness of the development pipeline for safe and 
effective drugs and biological products to treat patients with rare 
diseases, including rare cancers. FDA has published more than 18 
guidance documents since 2018 on topics that are highly relevant to 
drug and biological product development for rare diseases, including 
rare cancers. Some recent examples include:

    Of note, with regard to FDA and NIH ``developing treatments for 
more than one disease at a time,'' both agencies, along with several 
other entities, are working collaboratively to expedite development of 
gene therapies for rare diseases that are caused by a single genetic 
mutation and for which there is no commercial interest in developing 
therapies due to each disease's rarity. This effort, the Bespoke Gene 
Therapy Consortium, focuses on developing common gene therapy platforms 
and standards that can be used in the manufacture of several different 
gene therapies, each for a different rare disease, and thus would 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
increase efficiency overall.

    Further, NIH, and NCATS remain committed to supporting research to 
find treatments and cures for rare diseases and conditions without a 
treatment, and to increase the speed of therapeutic and diagnostic 
development. At NIH, NCATS's Division of Rare Diseases Research 
Innovation provides leadership, coordination and collaboration on rare 
disease research programs across the NIH. Research on specific rare 
diseases is supported by many NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices 
(ICOs) as falls within their respective missions.

    NCATS supports rare disease research projects with applicability to 
many diseases at a time, and works with other HHS operating divisions 
to ensure appropriate resources and expertise are being applied. One 
such program involving cross agency collaboration and targeting rare 
diseases is the Bespoke Gene Therapy Consortium (BGTC), a partnership 
with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Foundation for the 
National Institutes of Health (FNIH), NCATS and 10 other NIH Institutes 
and Centers (ICs), and several pharmaceutical companies and nonprofit 
organizations, that will streamline gene therapy development and 
products for rare disorders of no commercial interest. For BGTC 
clinical trials, scientists will develop strategies for streamlining 
the regulatory processes for FDA approval of safe and effective gene 
therapies, and they will develop standardized approaches to preclinical 
testing. BGTC has narrowed the potential diseases to be studied to 14, 
and proposals for clinical trials are being reviewed, with the 5-6 
chosen trials to be announced in May 2023.

    Another collaborative research initiative is the NIH Common Fund's 
Somatic Cell Genome Editing (SCGE) program, led by NCATS and the 
National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). Phase 
1 of the program aims to develop high-quality tools for performing safe 
and effective genome editing in humans and then make these tools widely 
available to the research community to reduce the time and cost of 
developing new therapies. Based on the success of Phase 1, the Common 
Fund approved a second phase of the program, which will be focused more 
on accelerating somatic genome editing clinical trials. Applications 
have been reviewed, and funded projects will be announced shortly. FDA 
collaborated with the SCGE program throughout Phase 1, and given the 
greater focus on clinical trials in Phase 2, the NIH and FDA plan to 
establish a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to efficiently translate 
the results from Phase 2 projects into the clinic.

    Question. The Inflation Reduction Act exempts an orphan drug 
indicated for a single rare disease/condition from Medicare price 
negotiation.

    Please clarify when the Medicare negotiation eligibility clock 
begins for a drug that loses the orphan drug exemption due to approval 
for an additional indication.

    Answer. CMS supports continued drug innovation and believes it is 
vitally important that beneficiaries have access to innovative new 
therapies. We are striving to implement the Negotiation Program in a 
thoughtful way that both improves drug affordability and accessibility 
for people with Medicare and supports innovation.

    The law requires CMS to exclude certain orphan drugs approved or 
licensed when identifying qualifying single source drugs, referred to 
as the orphan drug exclusion. To be considered for the orphan drug 
exclusion, the drug or biological product must (1) be designated as a 
drug for only one rare disease or condition by the FDA, and (2) be 
approved by the FDA only for one or more indications within such 
designated rare disease or condition. As noted in the initial guidance 
for the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program for initial price 
applicability year 2026, CMS is still considering whether there are 
additional actions CMS can take in its implementation of the 
Negotiation Program to best support orphan drug development. The agency 
will continue to keep Congress and relevant stakeholders updated as we 
move forward.

    Question. Value-based care is a bipartisan issue and a model many 
of us on this committee support as one way to meet our obligations to 
seniors but also to bring down costs. The administration has set a goal 
of having as many Medicare beneficiaries as possible in value-based 
care by 2030.

    I'm concerned about the potential chilling effect of the Medicare 
Advantage Advance Notice on risk adjustment for providers that take on 
full risk--as MA is the primary place that can happen--particularly in 
underserved areas in NC.

    How do you see the risk adjustment changes affecting value-based 
provider access for Medicare beneficiaries in underserved areas, 
particularly for duals? There are several provider organizations, 
including ones that operate in my State, saying the proposed changes 
will reduce resources for dually eligible Medicare beneficiaries.

    Answer. The proposals in the Advance Notice improve payment 
accuracy to ensure MA plan payments better reflect the expected costs 
of care, with higher payments going to plans serving people with 
greater health-care needs. This helps ensure that people in MA can 
continue to access the care they need.

    Additionally, there are protective features built into the MA risk 
adjustment system to ensure that plans caring for dually eligible 
individuals are paid adequately, and nothing in this proposal changes 
those features. We will continue to pay much more for someone who is 
dually eligible than someone who is not, even when they have the same 
diagnoses. These higher payments decrease incentives for plans to favor 
healthier enrollees or discriminate against sicker patients.

    To the extent beneficiaries who are low-income or who are living in 
rural or underserved areas have greater health-care needs, the proposed 
model would better compensate plans for that care. Furthermore, Federal 
law protects most dually eligible individuals from any cost sharing for 
Medicare services, so specific plans changes in cost sharing cannot be 
passed onto those dually eligible beneficiaries.

    CMS anticipates stable premiums and benefits for beneficiaries in 
2024, as seen previously in years with comparable updates. For example, 
in 2015, MA plans experienced a payment increase of 0.4 percent 
compared to 2014. Following those payment updates, the MA market 
remained strong and continued to grow. Historical experience shows 
plans compete in this highly competitive market to keep premiums down 
and maintain supplemental benefit levels, with beneficiary choice 
remaining strong.

    Question. As you are aware, the President's budget proposes further 
expanding the price-setting program to 5 years after approval for all 
drugs. This is concerning as some studies show that a full 50 percent 
of investments in all drugs are recouped in years 9 through 13.

    Can the administration provide data that shows R&D investments in 
complex drugs (like those aimed at treating diseases like cancer and 
Alzheimer's) can be recouped in just 5 years?

    What is the Department's estimate of the number of fewer new drugs 
as a result of the expansion of the negotiation program?

    Answer. The President's budget proposal builds on the Inflation 
Reduction Act by increasing the number of drugs subject to negotiation 
and making drugs eligible for negotiation sooner after their launch. 
Expanding the Drug Price Negotiation Program accelerates the increased 
gains in access for Medicare beneficiaries to innovative, life-saving 
treatments enacted by the law, with lower costs for people with 
Medicare and the program.

    Question. My State is home to some of the strongest universities in 
the Nation, and the research and development they undertake every day 
creates scores of new jobs, bolstering our economy and advancing our 
global leadership in biomedicine, along with numerous other fields. The 
expansion of the negotiation program included in the President's budget 
could demolish or downsize many of the public-
private partnerships that enable these institutions to innovate.

    How would your administration's proposal impact biomedical research 
and development--in numerical terms--and what would the downstream 
effects be for public-private partnerships and research hubs like the 
ones North Carolina?

    Answer. On March 15, 2023, CMS issued initial guidance detailing 
the requirements and parameters of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation 
Program, including requests for public comment on key elements, and 
announced the next steps for how the agency will implement the new 
program for 2026. In the initial guidance, CMS laid out an approach to 
negotiation that will focus on key questions, including but not limited 
to the selected drug's clinical benefit, the extent to which it 
fulfills an unmet medical need, and its impact on people who rely on 
Medicare. The statute requires that CMS consider certain manufacturer-
specific data, including research and development costs and recoupment 
of those costs, and available evidence about alternative treatments, as 
the basis for determining offers and counteroffers for a selected drug 
under the Negotiation Program. We are going to be considering the 
negotiation factors outlined in the law very seriously. We are striving 
to implement the Negotiation Program in a thoughtful way that both 
improves drug affordability and accessibility for people with Medicare 
and supports innovation.

    Question. The administration has allocated additional funding to 
expand access to telehealth, especially in rural and underserved areas. 
Further, through the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 
2023, Congress extended pandemic expanded telehealth access to the end 
of 2024.

    What changes in law are required to continue providing flexibility 
to enable expanded access beyond 2024 in rural and underserved areas?

    Answer. In response to the COVID-19 public health emergency, which 
is set to expire in May 2023, flexibilities for Medicare telehealth 
services were issued through legislative and regulatory authorities to 
increase access to care for patients and providers. The Consolidated 
Appropriations Act of 2023 recently extended many of these 
flexibilities through December 31, 2024. Extended telehealth 
flexibilities include waiving geographic and site of service 
originating site restrictions so that Medicare patients can continue to 
use telehealth services from their home and allowing audio-only 
telehealth services. Additionally, the expanded list of providers 
eligible to deliver telehealth services is also extended so Medicare 
beneficiaries can continue to receive telehealth services furnished by 
physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech language 
pathologists, and audiologists, as well as receive telehealth services 
from Rural Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers 
through December 31, 2024. If you are interested in drafting 
legislation to make these waivers permanent, CMS would be happy to 
provide technical assistance.

    Additionally, recent legislative and regulatory changes made 
several telehealth flexibilities permanent. Federally Qualified Health 
Centers and Rural Health Clinics can furnish certain mental health 
services via telecommunications technology. Medicare patients can 
continue to receive these telehealth services in their home as 
geographic restrictions on the originating site are eliminated for 
these telehealth services. Certain mental health telehealth services 
can be delivered using audio-only communication platforms, and rural 
emergency hospitals can serve as an originating site for telehealth 
services.

    For Medicaid and CHIP, telehealth flexibilities are not tied to the 
end of the PHE and have been offered by many State Medicaid programs 
long before the pandemic. Medicaid and CHIP telehealth policies will 
ultimately vary by State. CMS encourages States to continue to cover 
Medicaid and CHIP services when they are delivered via telehealth.

                                 ______
                                 
              Questions Submitted by Hon. Marsha Blackburn
    Question. We have a profound responsibility, through our Federal 
health-care programs, to address the needs of Americans with 
disabilities, as well as seniors and those living with debilitating 
conditions--including rare diseases.

    Unfortunately, several bureaucratic and controversial measures--
such as using so-called quality-adjusted life years, or QALYs--
undermine that broadly bipartisan mission. As explained by the National 
Council on Disability, ``QALYs place a lower value on treatments which 
extend the lives of people with chronic illnesses and disabilities.'' 
Patient advocates across the board have echoed these concerns for 
years, especially given the access gaps and barriers created by the use 
of these discriminatory metrics in other countries, particularly in 
Europe.

    For that reason, I recently joined a group of my colleagues in 
urging your department--and the administration more broadly--to 
eliminate the use of QALYs and other similar measures, both directly 
and indirectly, across our Federal health-care programs.

    Given the long history of bipartisan opposition to QALYs, can you 
commit to working with me and my colleagues, as well as your 
counterparts in other departments, to prevent the application of these 
types of metrics across all Federal programs?

    Answer. It has been a longstanding policy that Medicare does not 
use QALYs, in accordance with the law. We are happy to provide 
technical assistance on any legislation you draft.

    Question. The price controls imposed under the Inflation Reduction 
Act (IRA) have the potential to damage biomedical research and 
development, erode access to future treatments, and hand a competitive 
edge to our other global rivals. The law's impact on innovation in 
small-molecule drugs, which hold promise for addressing diseases like 
Alzheimer's and cancer, will prove particularly devastating. In fact, 
the majority of manufacturers have already reported plans to shift R&D 
away from these types of products due in part to the shorter exemption 
period for these drugs under the IRA's government price-setting 
program. I strongly support efforts to extend this exemption period 
from 9 years to 13, ensuring parity between small molecules and 
biologics.

    To that end, last month, I joined Senator Menendez in introducing 
the Maintaining Investments in New Innovation Act, which would provide 
this type of extension for gene-targeting therapies. I hope we can find 
bipartisan support for an even broader proposal to capture the full 
range of life-saving small-molecule drugs. If Congress fails to act on 
this front, patients--and especially seniors--will inevitably suffer.

    Can you commit to working with Congress to mitigate the harmful 
effects of the IRA's government price-setting program?

    Answer. We are striving to implement the Negotiation Program in a 
thoughtful way that both improves drug affordability and accessibility 
for people with Medicare and supports innovation. We are happy to 
provide technical assistance on your legislation.

    Question. The ``maximum fair price'' (MFP) risks spillover beyond 
Medicare (``commercial spillover'') in two ways: (1) diversion, when 
Medicare and 340B status may not be established and when the 
organization dispenses/administers to a patient contrary to law; and 
(2) reimbursement challenges, when commercial payers may seek to adjust 
to MFP-based reimbursement for non-MFP-eligible individuals, thus 
compromising patient access to therapies. MFP is also explicitly 
included in Best Price reporting, which could lead to price erosion in 
non-Medicare markets.

    Given that the IRA is intended to apply solely to Medicare and its 
beneficiaries, how will the administration assure that its mandated 
prices will not ``spill over'' and manipulate commercial and other non-
Medicare markets?

    As the administration works to implement the IRA's government 
price-setting program, will CMS commit to providing multiple notice and 
comment rulemaking periods, with reasonable time constraints, and 
assurance that CMS will respond to public comments to allow patient 
groups, manufacturers, and other stakeholders to have the ability to 
provide meaningful input?

    Answer. The Inflation Reduction Act requires manufacturers to 
provide access to the prices negotiated (i.e., maximum far prices) for 
the selected drugs when Medicare beneficiaries receive these drugs. 
There is no requirement for manufacturers to provide access to the 
maximum fair prices (MFPs) when commercially insured individuals 
receive these negotiated drugs.

    On March 15, 2023, CMS issued initial guidance detailing the 
requirements and parameters of the Negotiation Program, including 
requests for public comment on key elements, and announced the next 
steps for how the agency will implement the new program for 2026. As 
described in the initial guidance, CMS intends to require the 
manufacturers ensure that entities that dispense drugs to those MFP-
eligible individuals, including pharmacies, mail order services, and 
other dispensers, have access to the MFP for the selected drug, in 
accordance with the law. CMS intends to define ``providing access to 
the MFP'' as ensuring that the amount paid by the dispensing entity for 
the selected drug is no greater than the MFP. As part of the initial 
guidance, CMS is seeking comment on how such a process would operate 
most effectively, including suggestions on ways that CMS could provide 
technical assistance to entities to ensure they are able to provide the 
MFP to MFP-eligible individuals and ways to ensure that MFP-eligible 
individuals whose cost-sharing was not consistent with MFP are made 
whole.

    The Inflation Reduction Act requires that CMS implement the 
Negotiation Program for 2026, 2027, and 2028 by program instruction or 
other forms of program guidance. CMS recognizes that public input is 
essential for successful implementation. CMS has sought and will 
continue to seek feedback and insights from a wide range of interested 
parties throughout the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, 
including but not limited to comment on this initial guidance. Public 
feedback will contribute to the success of the Negotiation Program, and 
the initial guidance is one tool, among many, CMS will use to ensure 
interested parties' voices are heard on implementation of the new drug 
law. More information on how to submit comments can be found in the 
initial guidance. Comments received by April 14, 2023, will be 
considered for revised guidance. CMS anticipates issuing revised 
guidance for the first year of negotiation in Summer 2023. 
Additionally, this guidance is only for implementing drug price 
negotiation for initial price applicability year 2026. CMS is 
continuing to take feedback for future years of the program.

    Question. For decades, robust competition from generic drugs has 
cut costs for American patients from all walks of life. Generics 
currently account for 90 percent of all prescriptions filled in the 
U.S. and our generic drug prices are lower than virtually any other 
developed nation. Biosimilars have the potential to drive similarly 
strong cost savings among higher-cost medications. The FDA has approved 
at least 40 biosimilars, driving down prices for patients at the 
pharmacy counter and the doctor's office.

    However, I am concerned that the IRA's government price-setting 
program will reverse this trend and destroy the growing biosimilar 
market, resulting in higher health-care spending for consumers and 
taxpayers. During consideration of the IRA, I filed an amendment to 
shore up the biologic delay provision under the price-
setting program, given that the current language seems entirely 
unworkable for biosimilar development timelines. This is not a partisan 
proposal but rather a technical improvement that I hope to introduce as 
standalone legislation in partnership with my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle.

    Can you commit to working with me and with Congress more broadly to 
fix the IRA's special rule for delaying price-setting for biologics 
subject to impending competition, given the importance of promoting 
biosimilars?

    Answer. CMS acknowledges and prioritizes the importance of 
promoting biosimilars. We are implementing the Drug Price Negotiation 
Program under the Inflation Reduction Act, including the special rule 
to delay the selection and negotiation of certain biological products 
when there is a high likelihood that a biosimilar biological product 
(for which such biological product will be the reference product) will 
be licensed and marketed within 2 years in accordance with the law. We 
are happy to provide technical assistance on your legislation.

    Question. Patent protections are enshrined in our Constitution and 
have provided the driving incentive for most life-saving medical 
breakthroughs. The IRA's government price-setting program risks eroding 
intellectual property protections for American inventors, small 
businesses, and entrepreneurs. I have serious concerns with efforts to 
weaponize Federal programs and laws to undermine IP.

    Attempts to repurpose and distort the Bayh-Dole Act framework to 
seize American patents and impose sweeping price controls would destroy 
the partnerships responsible for many of our most groundbreaking 
treatments and cures. Senators Bayh and Dole both asserted as much for 
years, making clear that the so-called ``march-in'' provisions under 
their landmark law were never intended to enable Federal price-fixing.

    Can you commit to adhering to the law--and the express intent of 
its bipartisan drafters--and reject efforts to misuse march-in rights 
to dictate price controls for medications?

    Answer. The Bayh-Dole Act was designed to promote the 
commercialization of research results, maximize the potential for 
federally-funded technologies to become products, and serve the broader 
interest of the American public. HHS is committed to implementing the 
law and upholding these aims to support the innovation needed to 
deliver new and effective drugs to patients. To that end, HHS has 
partnered with the Department of Commerce to review the use of march-in 
authority as laid out in the Bayh-Dole Act. Through this partnership, 
we have asked an Interagency Working Group to develop a framework for 
consistent implementation of the march-in provision across the U.S. 
Government that clearly articulates guiding criteria and processes for 
making determinations where different factors, including price, may be 
a consideration in agencies' assessments. HHS will convene a workshop 
in 2023 to further refine the cases for which HHS could consider 
exercising march-in authority. HHS will seek input from a diverse array 
of interested parties--including patient groups, industry, 
universities, small business firms, and nonprofit organizations, as 
well as experts in technology transfer and innovation policy. The goal 
of the workshop will be to assess when the use of march-in rights is 
consistent with the policy and objectives of the Bayh-Dole Act.

    Question. Many therapies initially approved for a single indication 
go on to secure multiple indications, which is common among oncology 
drugs. The IRA arbitrarily applies the government price-setting mandate 
on a drug after the applicable exclusivity period regardless of follow-
on indications. I am concerned that this disincentivizes manufacturers 
from performing additional clinical trials and pursuing other 
indications.

    How will CMS ensure that innovation is unaffected, and 
manufacturers can continue post-approval development to realize the 
full breadth of a drug's potential benefit?

    Answer. CMS supports continued drug innovation and believes it is 
vitally important that beneficiaries have access to innovative new 
therapies. We are striving to implement the Negotiation Program in a 
thoughtful way that both improves drug affordability and accessibility 
for people with Medicare and supports innovation.

    The law requires CMS to exclude certain orphan drugs approved or 
licensed when identifying qualifying single source drugs, referred to 
as the orphan drug exclusion. To be considered for the orphan drug 
exclusion, the drug or biological product must (1) be designated as a 
drug for only one rare disease or condition by the FDA, and (2) be 
approved by the FDA only for one or more indications within such 
designated rare disease or condition. As noted in the initial guidance, 
we are still considering whether there are additional actions CMS can 
take in its implementation of the Negotiation Program to best support 
orphan drug development.

    Question. In enacting the No Surprises Act, Congress included the 
Qualifying Payment Amount (QPA) as only one of the several factors to 
be considered in the IDR process. The Federal Courts have twice 
admonished HHS about the bias toward the QPA. Yet, the administration 
has not taken basic corrective action against this tilting of the 
playing field in favor of insurers.

    Do you now agree to clarify through guidance that the rates used to 
calculate the QPA must be the median of the contracted rates ``paid'' 
by the plan in January 2019?

    Because regulation gives primacy in the dispute resolution process 
to these QPAs, insurance companies have uniformly refused to negotiate 
with providers during the 30-day negotiation period established in the 
law.

    In your opinion, which party is better prepared to weather long 
periods of cashflow delay, doctors or insurers?

    While audits will not solve the manipulation of median prices, they 
are critical to ensuring a full and fair arbitration process.

    Why has HHS not yet moved forward with implementing section 102 of 
the No Surprises Act, which requires establishing an auditing process 
for health insurers effective October 1, 2021?

    Answer. CMS is committed to implementing the No Surprises Act (NSA) 
consistent with the law. Certified Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR) 
entities are required to consider the qualifying payment amount (QPA) 
and certain additional factors when selecting between the offer 
submitted by a plan or issuer and the offer submitted by a facility, 
provider, or provider of air ambulance services when determining the 
total out-of-network payment rate for items and services subject to the 
Federal IDR process. The QPA for a given item or service generally is 
the median contracted rate on January 31, 2019 for the same or similar 
item or service, increased for inflation.

    The standards governing a certified IDR entity's consideration of 
information when making payment determinations for disputes involving 
items or services furnished on or after October 25, 2022 are provided 
in the August 2022 final rules, as revised by the opinion and order of 
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in Texas 
Medical Association, et al. v. United States Department of Health and 
Human Services et al., Case, No. 6:22-cv-372 (February 6, 2023). As of 
March 17, 2023, the Departments have completed the necessary updates to 
the Federal IDR portal and Federal IDR process guidance documents to 
reflect these revised payment determination standards.

    Additionally, consistent with section 102 of the No Surprises Act, 
the Departments outlined the QPA auditing requirements in Requirements 
Related to Surprise Billing, part 1 (July 13, 2021) and CMS is 
conducting QPA audits on behalf of all departments to ensure that plans 
and issuers are complying with requirements related to the calculation 
and disclosure of the QPA. The NSA requires the departments to submit a 
report to Congress for each year in which audits were conducted. The 
departments are actively conducting QPA audits as required under the 
statute and intend to produce the reports to Congress required in the 
law.

    Question. Over half of the Medicare care beneficiaries in Tennessee 
rely on Medicare Advantage plans--around half a million Tennesseans. 
Many of these beneficiaries are low-income and in rural parts of the 
State where the extra benefits, like health programs and additional 
support for those with disabilities, are especially important. This 
administration seems dead set on pushing policies that harm the 
Medicare Advantage program, like the recently proposed cuts to the 
program, which will decrease benefits for some of Tennessee's most 
vulnerable, like those in special needs plans.

    Is the Department concerned that its recent payment determinations 
will affect care for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, which account 
for more than half of all Medicare enrollees nationwide?

    Answer. As required by law, CMS adjusts payments to health plans 
offering MA to reflect the expected health-care costs of enrollees 
based on health status and demographic characteristics through a 
process known as ``risk adjustment.'' This ensures CMS pays more for 
enrollees with greater health-care needs and reduces incentives for 
plans to favor healthier beneficiaries. CMS routinely makes updates to 
the MA risk adjustment model to reflect more recent utilization and 
cost patterns and to ensure MA payments accurately reflect the costs of 
care for MA enrollees. In February, CMS proposed routine technical 
updates to improve the accuracy of MA payments in the 2024 Advance 
Notice. CMS received public feedback on these proposals, and will take 
this feedback into account when finalizing the 2024 Rate Announcement.

    Question. The President's budget proposes to increase funding for 
the title X family planning program from $286 million to $512 million. 
The title X program has been called a slush fund for abortion 
providers, like Planned Parenthood, who are expected to receive tens of 
millions annually from this program now that your rule, allowing 
grantees to be collocated with abortion clinics, has taken effect.

    A January 2023 Marist poll found that 60 percent of Americans 
oppose using tax dollars to fund abortions. Why do you continue to 
subsidize the abortion industry despite most Americans opposing using 
their tax dollars for this purpose?

    How much Federal funding have abortion groups like Planned 
Parenthood received from HHS since you became the Secretary?

    Answer. As HHS Secretary, my role is to implement the law. The 
Department will follow all applicable laws as they relate to abortion 
and any other issue.

    Question. Millions of Americans are living with limb loss and limb 
difference. Despite the robust size of this population, policymakers 
know very little about how the health care delivery system serves 
individuals as they navigate the unique challenges they confront. To 
address this shortcoming, with Senator Duckworth and Representatives 
Guthrie and Butterfield, I introduced the Triple-A Study Act in the 
last Congress, asking GAO to study how Medicare and Medicaid are 
meeting the needs of the limb loss and limb difference community. GAO 
has begun its work, and we expect the study to be completed later this 
year.

    As we learn more from GAO regarding gaps in care and opportunities 
for improvement, can we count on you to work with us to ensure that the 
limb loss and limb difference community has access to the high-quality 
care they expect and deserve from the Medicare and Medicaid programs?

    Answer. CMS looks forward to reviewing this study from the working 
with the GAO on this review and we would be happy to work with you on 
this issue, including providing technical assistance on any legislation 
you draft.

    Question. I've written to CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure 
about the need to provide coverage of important technologies for people 
with serious disabilities like ALS, MS, and spinal cord injuries. I 
appreciate your team proposing that Medicare cover seat elevation 
systems for people with disabilities, but I encourage you to finalize 
this important coverage decision.

    Will you commit to issuing a similar coverage proposal for standing 
systems that help people with disabilities perform activities of daily 
living and avoid costly complications?

    Answer. In February 2023 CMS published a proposed National Coverage 
Determination (NCD) to expand Medicare coverage for power seat 
elevation equipment for individuals with a Group 3 power wheelchair. 
The public comment period closed on this NCD last month. CMS plans to 
consider standing equipment in a separate future national coverage 
analysis. I'm happy to stay in touch with you as CMS undertakes this 
process.

    Question. In your first 2 years as Secretary leading the department 
responsible for overseeing the Federal response to the COVID-19 
pandemic that has claimed the lives of over 1 million Americans, have 
you ever spent an extended period working from California?

    What percentage of your time have you spent in California in your 2 
years as Secretary?

    Can the Department commit to proactively sharing documents released 
through FOIA related to the Secretary's calendars and travel that are 
``frequently requested'' (described in subsection (a)(2) of Sec. 552 as 
records having been requested three or more times) with my office?

    Answer. HHS is incredibly proud of the work that HHS has 
accomplished during this administration. This is a 24/7 job and I treat 
it as such, whether I am in an office building, on domestic or 
international official travel, or teleworking. As always, our north 
star will continue to be delivering on our mission which means building 
on the innovations and technology that we have put to work to ensure we 
are enhancing the health and well-being of all Americans.

    HHS is committed to transparency and to working in good faith to 
address members' requests for information.

    Question. Digital health technologies, including clinical decision 
support software, software as a medical device, patient remote 
monitoring, and AI-enabled services, have already improved patient 
outcomes and provider efficiency.

    What is CMS's strategy to address this emerging field of medicine 
and adequately incorporate digital health technologies into the 
Medicare payment systems across all settings?

    Answer. Thank you for your interest in expanding access to digital 
technologies in Medicare. President Biden's Fiscal Year 2024 budget 
includes a proposal that would allow for Medicare coverage of evidence-
based digital applications and platforms that facilitate greater access 
to behavioral health services, especially for beneficiaries who live in 
rural or health professional shortage areas. If you are interested in 
drafting legislation to address Medicare's coverage of digital 
technologies, CMS would be happy to provide technical assistance.

    Question. Section 218(b) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act 
of 2014 directed the HHS Secretary to establish AUC program by January 
1, 2017 with a relevant clinical decision support mechanism (CDSM) to 
assess the appropriateness of imaging services based on a patient's 
needs. Congress intended for the AUC program to ensure the best 
possible high-value imaging to patients, while avoiding unnecessary or 
duplicative procedures. It has been over 8 years since PAMA was 
enacted. After several delays, CMS indicated this past July that full 
implementation of the AUC program was delayed until further notice.

    What are the specific reasons for the persistent delays in 
implementation? Is CMS considering a new implementation timeline? If 
so, what is the new timeline?

    CMS has indicated that significant concerns related to improperly 
denying claims that may not be subject to the AUC consultation 
requirement (e.g., imaging performed in critical access hospitals) 
still exist and preclude full implementation.

    Is this concern expressed by CMS still valid? Does CMS envision a 
solution to this concern?

    Would CMS be open to working with Congress and other stakeholders 
to identify AUC implementation difficulties, and then amend PAMA to 
alleviate those concerns and successfully implement this program?

    Answer. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) directed CMS 
to establish a program to promote the use of appropriate use criteria 
(AUC) for advanced diagnostic imaging services. CMS has taken steps to 
implement this program over several years, and codified the AUC program 
in our regulations. In Calendar Year 2020, CMS began conducting an 
educational and operations testing period for the claims-based 
reporting of AUC consultation information. This operations and testing 
period has been extended until further notice.

    Further, to incentivize the use of qualified clinical decision 
support mechanisms (CDSMs) to consult AUC, CMS established in the CY 
2018 Updates to the Quality Payment Program; and Quality Payment 
Program: Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances Policy for the 
Transition Year final rule and interim final rule, a high-weighted 
improvement activity under the Merit-based Incentive Payment System 
(MIPS). This activity can be selected under MIPS by ordering 
professionals who consult specified AUC using a qualified CDSM. The 
activity was implemented with the performance period that began January 
1, 2018.

    CMS is continuing to evaluate the AUC program, as well as other 
quality and value-based care initiatives that may help with appropriate 
utilization of advanced diagnostic imaging services. In previous 
rulemaking, CMS has raised operational and administrative issues with 
the AUC program and solicited additional information from stakeholders 
on mechanisms to ensure that only appropriate claims are subject to AUC 
claims processing edits. The identification of claims that are or are 
not subject to the Medicare AUC Program must be precise to avoid 
inadvertently denying claims that should be paid. CMS would be happy to 
work with Congress and provide technical assistance on any potential 
amendments related to this program.

 Alone and Exploited, Migrant Children Work Brutal Jobs Across the U.S.

                            By Hannah Dreier

Arriving in record numbers, they're ending up in dangerous jobs that 
violate child labor laws--including in factories that make products for 
well-known brands like Cheetos and Fruit of the Loom.

Cristian works a construction job instead of going to school. He is 14.

Carolina packages Cheerios at night in a factory. She is 15.

Wander starts looking for day-labor jobs before sunrise. He is 13.
                                 ______
                                 
It was almost midnight in Grand Rapids, MI, but inside the factory 
everything was bright. A conveyor belt carried bags of Cheerios past a 
cluster of young workers. One was 15-year-old Carolina Yoc, who came to 
the United States on her own last year to live with a relative she had 
never met.

About every 10 seconds, she stuffed a sealed plastic bag of cereal into 
a passing yellow carton. It could be dangerous work, with fast-moving 
pulleys and gears that had torn off fingers and ripped open a woman's 
scalp.

The factory was full of underage workers like Carolina, who had crossed 
the southern border by themselves and were now spending late hours bent 
over hazardous machinery, in violation of child labor laws. At nearby 
plants, other children were tending giant ovens to make Chewy and 
Nature Valley granola bars and packing bags of Lucky Charms and 
Cheetos--all of them working for the processing giant Hearthside Food 
Solutions, which would ship these products around the country.

``Sometimes I get tired and feel sick,'' Carolina said after a shift in 
November. Her stomach often hurt, and she was unsure if that was 
because of the lack of sleep, the stress from the incessant roar of the 
machines, or the worries she had for herself and her family in 
Guatemala. ``But I'm getting used to it.''

These workers are part of a new economy of exploitation: migrant 
children, who have been coming into the United States without their 
parents in record numbers, are ending up in some of the most punishing 
jobs in the country, a New York Times investigation found. This shadow 
work force extends across industries in every state, flouting child 
labor laws that have been in place for nearly a century. Twelve-year-
old roofers in Florida and Tennessee. Underage slaughterhouse workers 
in Delaware, Mississippi and North Carolina. Children sawing planks of 
wood on overnight shifts in South Dakota.

Largely from Central America, the children are driven by economic 
desperation that was worsened by the pandemic. This labor force has 
been slowly growing for almost a decade, but it has exploded since 
2021, while the systems meant to protect children have broken down.

The Times spoke with more than 100 migrant child workers in 20 states 
who described jobs that were grinding them into exhaustion, and fears 
that they had become trapped in circumstances they never could have 
imagined. The Times examination also drew on court and inspection 
records and interviews with hundreds of lawyers, social workers, 
educators and law enforcement officials.

In town after town, children scrub dishes late at night. They run 
milking machines in Vermont and deliver meals in New York City. They 
harvest coffee and build lava rock walls around vacation homes in 
Hawaii. Girls as young as 13 wash hotel sheets in Virginia.

Oscar Lopez, a ninth grader, works overnight at a sawmill in South 
Dakota. On this day, he skipped school to sleep after a 14-hour shift. 
                  Kirsten Luce for The New York Times.

In many parts of the country, middle and high school teachers in 
English-language learner programs say it is now common for nearly all 
their students to rush off to long shifts after their classes end.

 ``They should not be working 12-hour days, but it's happening here,'' 
said Valeria Lindsay, a language arts teacher at Homestead Middle 
School near Miami. For the past 3 years, she said, almost every eighth 
grader in her English learner program of about 100 students was also 
carrying an adult workload.

Migrant child labor benefits both under-the-table operations and global 
corporations, The Times found. In Los Angeles, children stitch ``Made 
in America'' tags into J. Crew shirts. They bake dinner rolls sold at 
Walmart and Target, process milk used in Ben & Jerry's ice cream and 
help debone chicken sold at Whole Foods. As recently as the fall, 
middle-schoolers made Fruit of the Loom socks in Alabama. In Michigan, 
children make auto parts used by Ford and General Motors.

The number of unaccompanied minors entering the United States climbed 
to a high of 130,000 last year--three times what it was 5 years 
earlier--and this summer is expected to bring another wave.

These are not children who have stolen into the country undetected. The 
federal government knows they are in the United States, and the 
Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for ensuring 
sponsors will support them and protect them from trafficking or 
exploitation.

But as more and more children have arrived, the Biden White House has 
ramped up demands on staffers to move the children quickly out of 
shelters and release them to adults. Caseworkers say they rush through 
vetting sponsors.

While H.H.S. checks on all minors by calling them a month after they 
begin living with their sponsors, data obtained by The Times showed 
that over the last 2 years, the agency could not reach more than 85,000 
children. Overall, the agency lost immediate contact with a third of 
migrant children.

An H.H.S. spokeswoman said the agency wanted to release children 
swiftly, for the sake of their well-being, but had not compromised 
safety. ``There are numerous places along the process to continually 
ensure that a placement is in the best interest of the child,'' said 
the spokeswoman, Kamara Jones.

Far from home, many of these children are under intense pressure to 
earn money. They send cash back to their families while often being in 
debt to their sponsors for smuggling fees, rent and living expenses.

``It's getting to be a business for some of these sponsors,'' said 
Annette Passalacqua, who left her job as a caseworker in Central 
Florida last year. Ms. Passalacqua said she saw so many children put to 
work, and found law enforcement officials so unwilling to investigate 
these cases, that she largely stopped reporting them. Instead, she 
settled for explaining to the children that they were entitled to lunch 
breaks and overtime.

Sponsors are required to send migrant children to school, and some 
students juggle classes and heavy workloads. Other children arrive to 
find that they have been misled by their sponsors and will not be 
enrolled in school.

The federal government hires child welfare agencies to track some 
minors who are deemed to be at high risk. But caseworkers at those 
agencies said that H.H.S. regularly ignored obvious signs of labor 
exploitation, a characterization the agency disputed.

In interviews with more than 60 caseworkers, most independently 
estimated that about two-thirds of all unaccompanied migrant children 
ended up working full time.

A representative for Hearthside said the company relied on a staffing 
agency to supply some workers for its plants in Grand Rapids, but 
conceded that it had not required the agency to verify ages through a 
national system that checks Social Security numbers. Unaccompanied 
migrant children often obtain false identification to secure work.

``We are immediately implementing additional controls to reinforce all 
agencies' strict compliance with our long standing requirement that all 
workers must be 18 or over,'' the company said in a statement.

At Union High School in Grand Rapids, Carolina's ninth-grade social 
studies teacher, Rick Angstman, has seen the toll that long shifts take 
on his students. One, who was working nights at a commercial laundry, 
began passing out in class from fatigue and was hospitalized twice, he 
said. Unable to stop working, she dropped out of school.

``She disappeared into oblivion,'' Mr. Angstman said. ``It's the new 
child labor. You're taking children from another country and putting 
them in almost indentured servitude.''

On the Night Shift

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]


When Carolina left Guatemala, she had no real understanding of what 
she was heading toward, just a sense that she could not stay in her 
village any longer. There was not much electricity or water, and after 
the pandemic began, not much food.

The only people who seemed to be getting by were the families living 
off remittances from relatives in the United States. Carolina lived 
lone with her grandmother, whose health began failing. When neighbors 
started talking about heading north, she decided to join. She was 14.

``I just kept walking,'' she said.

Carolina reached the U.S. border exhausted, weighing 84 pounds. Agents 
sent her to an H.H.S. shelter in Arizona, where a caseworker contacted 
her aunt, Marcelina Ramirez. Ms. Ramirez was at first reluctant: She 
had already sponsored two other relatives and had three children of her 
own. They were living on $600 a week, and she didn't know Carolina.

When Carolina arrived in Grand Rapids last year, Ms. Ramirez told her 
she would go to school every morning and suggested that she pick up 
evening shifts at Hearthside. She knew Carolina needed to send money 
back to her grandmother. She also believed it was good for young people 
to work. Child labor is the norm in rural Guatemala, and she herself 
had started working around the second grade.

One of the nation's largest contract manufacturers, Hearthside makes 
and packages food for companies like Frito-Lay, General Mills and 
Quaker Oats. ``It would be hard to find a cookie or cracker aisle in 
any leading grocer that does not contain multiple products from 
Hearthside production facilities,'' a Grand Rapids-area plant manager 
told a trade magazine in 2019.

General Mills, whose brands include Cheerios, Lucky Charms and Nature 
Valley, said it recognized ``the seriousness of this situation'' and 
was reviewing The Times's findings. PepsiCo, which owns Frito-Lay and 
Quaker Oats, declined to comment.

Three people who until last year worked at one of the biggest 
employment agencies in Grand Rapids, Forge Industrial Staffing, said 
Hearthside supervisors were sometimes made aware that they were getting 
young-looking workers whose identities had been flagged as false.

``Hearthside didn't care,'' said Nubia Malacara, a former Forge 
employee who said she had also worked at Hearthside as a minor.

In a statement, Hearthside said, ``We do care deeply about this issue 
and are concerned about the mischaracterization of Hearthside.'' A 
spokesman for Forge said it complied with state and federal laws and 
``would never knowingly employ individuals under 18.''

Kevin Tomas said he sought work through Forge after he arrived in Grand 
Rapids at age 13 with his 7-year-old brother. At first, he was sent to 
a local manufacturer that made auto parts for Ford and General Motors. 
But his shift ended at 6:30 in the morning, so he could not stay awake 
in school, and he struggled to lift the heavy boxes.

``It's not that we want to be working these jobs. It's that we have to 
help our families,'' Kevin said.

By the time he was 15, Kevin had found a job at Hearthside, stacking 
50-pound cases of cereal on the same shift as Carolina.

``So Many Red Flags''

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]


The growth of migrant child labor in the United States over the 
past several years is a result of a chain of willful ignorance. 
Companies ignore the young faces in their back rooms and on their 
factory floors. Schools often decline to report apparent labor 
violations, believing it will hurt children more than help. And H.H.S. 
behaves as if the migrant children who melt unseen into the country are 
doing just fine.

``As the government, we've turned a blind eye to their trafficking,'' 
said Doug Gilmer, the head of the Birmingham, Ala., office of Homeland 
Security Investigations, a federal agency that often becomes involved 
with immigration cases.

Mr. Gilmer teared up as he recalled finding 13-year-olds working in 
meat plants; 12-year-olds working at suppliers for Hyundai and Kia, as 
documented last year by a Reuters investigation; and children who 
should have been in middle school working at commercial bakeries.

``We're encountering it here because we're looking for it here,'' Mr. 
Gilmer said. ``It's happening everywhere.''

Children have crossed the southern border on their own for decades, and 
since 2008, the United States has allowed non-Mexican minors to live 
with sponsors while they go through immigration proceedings, which can 
take several years. The policy, codified in anti-trafficking 
legislation, is intended to prevent harm to children who would 
otherwise be turned away and left alone in a Mexican border town.

When Kelsey Keswani first worked as an H.H.S. contractor in Arizona to 
connect unaccompanied migrant children with sponsors in 2010, the 
adults were almost always the children's parents, who had paid 
smugglers to bring them up from Central America, she said.

But around 2014, the number of arriving children began to climb, and 
their circumstances were different. In recent years, ``the kids almost 
all have a debt to pay off, and they're super stressed about it,'' Ms. 
Keswani said.

She began to see more failures in the vetting process. ``There were so 
many cases where sponsors had sponsored multiple kids, and it wasn't 
getting caught. So many red flags with debt. So many reports of 
trafficking.''

Now, just a third of migrant children are going to their parents. A 
majority are sent to other relatives, acquaintances or even strangers, 
a Times analysis of federal data showed. Nearly half are coming from 
Guatemala, where poverty is fueling a wave of migration. Parents know 
that they would be turned away at the border or quickly deported, so 
they send their children in hopes that remittances will come back.

In the last 2 years alone, more than 250,000 children have entered the 
United States by themselves.

The shifting dynamics in Central America helped create a political 
crisis early in Mr. Biden's presidency, when children started crossing 
the border faster than H.H.S. could process them. With no room left in 
shelters, the children stayed in jail-like facilities run by Customs 
and Border Protection and, later, in tent cities. The images of 
children sleeping on gym mats under foil blankets attracted intense 
media attention.

The Biden administration pledged to move children through the shelter 
system more quickly. ``We don't want to continue to see a child 
languish in our care if there is a responsible sponsor,'' Xavier 
Becerra, secretary of health and human services, told Congress in 2021.

    His agency began paring back protections that had been in place 
for years, including some background checks and reviews of children's 
files, according to memos reviewed by The Times and interviews with 
more than a dozen current and former employees.

``Twenty percent of kids have to be released every week or you get 
dinged,'' said Ms. Keswani, who stopped working with H.H.S. last month.

Concerns piled up in summer 2021 at the Office of Refugee Resettlement, 
the H.H.S. division responsible for unaccompanied migrant children. In 
a memo that July, 11 managers said they were worried that labor 
trafficking was increasing and complained to their bosses that the 
office had become ``one that rewards individuals for making quick 
releases, and not one that rewards individuals for preventing unsafe 
releases.''

Staff members said in interviews that Mr. Becerra continued to push for 
faster results, often asking why they could not discharge children with 
machine-like efficiency.

``If Henry Ford had seen this in his plants, he would have never become 
famous and rich. This is not the way you do an assembly line,'' Mr. 
Becerra said at a staff meeting last summer, according to a recording 
obtained by The Times.

The H.H.S. spokeswoman, Ms. Jones, said that Mr. Becerra had urged his 
staff to ``step it up.'' ``Like any good leader, he wouldn't hesitate 
to do it again--especially when it comes to the well-being and safety 
of children,'' she said.

During a call last March, Mr. Becerra told Cindy Huang, the O.R.R. 
director, that if she could not increase the number of discharges, he 
would find someone who could, according to five people familiar with 
the call. She resigned a month later.

He recently made a similar threat to her successor during a meeting 
with senior leadership, according to several people who were present.

``It Was All Lies''

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]


While many migrant children are sent to the United States by their 
parents, others are persuaded to come by adults who plan to profit from 
their labor.

Nery Cutzal was 13 when he met his sponsor over Facebook Messenger. 
Once Nery arrived in Florida, he discovered that he owed more than 
$4,000 and had to find his own place to live. His sponsor sent him 
threatening text messages and kept a running list of new debts: $140 
for filling out H.H.S. paperwork; $240 for clothes from Walmart; $45 
for a taco dinner.

``Don't mess with me,'' the sponsor wrote. ``You don't mean anything to 
me.''

Nery began working until 3 a.m. most nights at a trendy Mexican 
restaurant near Palm Beach to make the payments. ``He said I would be 
able to go to school and he would take care of me, but it was all 
lies,'' Nery said.

His father, Leonel Cutzal, said the family had become destitute after a 
series of bad harvests and had no choice but to send their oldest son 
north from Guatemala.

``Even when he shares $50, it's a huge help,'' Mr. Cutzal said. 
``Otherwise, there are times we don't eat.'' Mr. Cutzal had not 
understood how much Nery would be made to work, he said. ``I think he 
passed through some hard moments being up there so young.''

Nery eventually contacted law enforcement, and his sponsor was found 
guilty last year of smuggling a child into the United States for 
financial gain. That outcome is rare: In the past decade, federal 
prosecutors have brought only about 30 cases involving forced labor of 
unaccompanied minors, according to a Times review of court databases.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]


Unlike the foster care system, in which all children get case 
management, H.H.S. provides this service to about a third of children 
who pass through its care, and usually for just 4 months. Tens of 
thousands of other children are sent to their sponsors with little but 
the phone number for a national hotline. From there, they are often on 
their own: there is no formal follow-up from any federal or local 
agencies to ensure that sponsors are not putting children to work 
illegally.

In Pennsylvania, one case worker told The Times he went to check on a 
child released to a man who had applied to sponsor 20 other minors. The 
boy had vanished. In Texas, another case worker said she had 
encountered a man who had been targeting poor families in Guatemala, 
promising to help them get rich if they sent their children across the 
border. He had sponsored 13 children.

``If you've been in this field for any amount of time, you know that 
there's what the sponsors agree to, and what they're actually doing,'' 
said Bernal Cruz Munoz, a caseworker supervisor in Oregon.

Calling the hotline is not a sure way to get support, either. Juanito 
Ferrer called for help after he was brought to Manassas, VA, at age 15 
by an acquaintance who forced him to paint houses during the day and 
guard an apartment complex at night. His sponsor took his paychecks and 
watched him on security cameras as he slept on the basement floor.

Juanito said that when he called the hotline in 2019, the person on the 
other end just took a report. ``I thought they'd send the police or 
someone to check, but they never did that,'' he said. ``I thought they 
would come and inspect the house, at least.'' He eventually escaped.

Asked about the hotline, H.H.S. said operators passed reports onto law 
enforcement and other local agencies because the agency did not have 
the authority to remove children from homes.

The Times analyzed government data to identify places with high 
concentrations of children who had been released to people outside 
their immediate families--a sign that they might have been expected to 
work. In northwest Grand Rapids, for instance, 93 percent of children 
have been released to adults who are not their parents.

H.H.S. does not track these clusters, but the trends are so pronounced 
that officials sometimes notice hot spots anyway.

Scott Lloyd, who led the resettlement office in the Trump 
administration, said he realized in 2018 that the number of 
unaccompanied Guatemalan boys being released to sponsors in South 
Florida seemed to be growing.

 ``I always wondered what was happening there,'' he said.

But his attention was diverted by the chaos around the Trump 
administration's child separation policy, and he never looked into it. 
The trend he saw has only accelerated: For example, in the past 3 
years, more than 200 children have been released to distant relatives 
or unrelated adults around Immokalee, FL., an agricultural hub with a 
long history of labor exploitation.

In a statement, H.H.S. said it had updated its case management system 
to better flag instances when multiple children were being released to 
the same person or address.

Many sponsors see themselves as benevolent, doing a friend or neighbor 
a favor by agreeing to help a child get out of a government shelter, 
even if they do not intend to offer any support. Children often 
understand that they will have to work, but do not grasp the 
unrelenting grind that awaits them.

``I didn't get how expensive everything was,'' said 13-year-old Jose 
Vasquez, who works 12-hour shifts, 6 days a week, at a commercial egg 
farm in Michigan and lives with his teenage sister. ``I'd like to go to 
school, but then how would I pay rent?''

Occupational Hazards

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]


One fall morning at Union High School in Grand Rapids, Carolina 
listened to Mr. Angstman lecture on the journalist Jacob Riis and the 
Progressive Era movement that helped create federal child labor laws. 
He explained that the changes were meant to keep young people out of 
jobs that could harm their health or safety, and showed the class a 
photo of a small boy making cigars.

``Riis reported that members of this family worked 17 hours a day, 7 
days a week,'' he told the students. ``The cramped space reeked of 
toxic fumes.'' Students seemed unmoved. Some struggled to stay awake.

Teachers at the school estimated that 200 of their immigrant students 
were working full time while trying to keep up with their classes. The 
greatest share of Mr. Angstman's students worked at one of the four 
Hearthside plants in the city.

The company, which has 39 factories in the United States, has been 
cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for 34 
violations since 2019, including for unsafe conveyor belts at the plant 
where Carolina found her job. At least 11 workers suffered amputations 
in that time. In 2015, a machine caught the hairnet of an Ohio worker 
and ripped off part of her scalp.

The history of accidents ``shows a corporate culture that lacks urgency 
to keep workers safe,'' an OSHA official wrote after the most recent 
violation for an amputation.

Underage workers in Grand Rapids said that spicy dust from immense 
batches of Flamin' Hot Cheetos made their lungs sting, and that moving 
heavy pallets of cereal all night made their backs ache. They worried 
about their hands getting caught in conveyor belts, which federal law 
classifies as so hazardous that no child Carolina's age is permitted to 
work with them.

Hearthside said in a statement that it was committed to complying with 
laws governing worker protections. ``We strongly dispute the safety 
allegations made and are proud of our safety-first culture,'' the 
statement read.

Federal law bars minors from a long list of dangerous jobs, including 
roofing, meat processing and commercial baking. Except on farms, 
children younger than 16 are not supposed to work for more than 3 hours 
or after 7 p.m. on school days.

But these jobs--which are grueling and poorly paid, and thus 
chronically short-staffed--are exactly where many migrant children are 
ending up. Adolescents are twice as likely as adults to be seriously 
injured at work, yet recently arrived preteens and teenagers are 
running industrial dough mixers, driving massive earthmovers and 
burning their hands on hot tar as they lay down roofing shingles, The 
Times found.

Unaccompanied minors have had their legs torn off in factories and 
their spines shattered on construction sites, but most of these 
injuries go uncounted. The Labor Department tracks the deaths of 
foreign-born child workers but no longer makes them public. Reviewing 
state and federal safety records and public reports, The Times found a 
dozen cases of young migrant workers killed since 2017, the last year 
the Labor Department reported any.

The deaths include a 14-year-old food delivery worker who was hit by a 
car while on his bike at a Brooklyn intersection; a 16-year-old who was 
crushed under a 35-ton tractor-scraper outside Atlanta; and a 15-year-
old who fell 50 feet from a roof in Alabama where he was laying down 
shingles.

In 2021, Karla Campbell, a Nashville labor lawyer, helped a woman 
figure out how to transport the body of her 14-year-old grandson, who 
had been killed on a landscaping job, back to his village in Guatemala. 
It was the second child labor death she had handled that year.

``I've been working on these cases for 15 years, and the addition of 
children is new,'' Ms. Campbell said.

In dairy production, the injury rate is twice the national average 
across all industries. Paco Calvo arrived in Middlebury, VT when he was 
14 and has been working 12-hour days on dairy farms in the 4 years 
since. He said he crushed his hand in an industrial milking machine in 
the first months of doing this work.

``Pretty much everyone gets hurt when they first start,'' he said.

Targeting the Middlemen

Charlene Irizarry, the human resources manager at Farm Fresh Foods, an 
Alabama meat plant that struggles to retain staff, recently realized 
she was interviewing a 12-year-old for a job slicing chicken breasts 
into nuggets in a section of the factory kept at 40 degrees.

Ms. Irizarry regularly sees job applicants who use heavy makeup or 
medical masks to try to hide their youth, she said.``Sometimes their 
legs don't touch the floor.''

Other times, an adult will apply for a job in the morning, and then a 
child using the same name will show up for orientation that afternoon. 
She and her staff have begun separating other young applicants from the 
adults who bring them in, so they will admit their real ages.

Ms. Irizarry said the plant had already been fined for one child labor 
violation, and she was trying to avoid another. But she wondered what 
the children might face if she turned them away.

``I worry about why they're so desperate for these jobs,'' she said.

In interviews with underage migrant workers, The Times found child 
labor in the American supply chains of many major brands and retailers. 
Several, including Ford, General Motors, J. Crew and Walmart, as well 
as their suppliers, said they took the allegations seriously and would 
investigate. Target and Whole Foods did not respond to requests for 
comment. Fruit of the Loom said it had ended its contract with the 
supplier.

One company, Ben & Jerry's, said it worked with labor groups to ensure 
a minimum set of working conditions at its dairy suppliers. Cheryl 
Pinto, the company's head of values-led sourcing, said that if migrant 
children needed to work full time, it was preferable for them to have 
jobs at a well-monitored workplace.

The Labor Department is supposed to find and punish child labor 
violations, but inspectors in a dozen states said their understaffed 
offices could barely respond to complaints, much less open original 
investigations. When the department has responded to tips on migrant 
children, it has focused on the outside contractors and staffing 
agencies that usually employ them, not the corporations where they 
perform the work.

In Worthington, MN, it had long been an open secret that migrant 
children released by H.H.S. were cleaning a slaughterhouse run by JBS, 
the world's largest meat processor. The town has received more 
unaccompanied migrant children per capita than almost anywhere in the 
country.

Outside the JBS pork plant last fall, The Times spoke with baby-faced 
workers who chased and teased one another as they came off their shifts 
in the morning. Many had scratched their assumed names off company 
badges to hide evidence that they were working under false identities. 
Some said they had suffered chemical burns from the corrosive cleaners 
they used.

Not long afterward, labor inspectors responding to a tip found 22 
Spanish-speaking children working for the company hired to clean the 
JBS plant in Worthington, and dozens more in the same job at meat-
processing plants around the United States.

But the Labor Department can generally only issue fines. The cleaning 
company paid a $1.5 million penalty, while JBS said it had been unaware 
that children were scouring the Worthington factory each night. JBS 
fired the cleaning contractor.

Many of the children who were working there have found new jobs at 
other plants, The Times found.

``I still have to pay back my debt, so I still have to work,'' said 
Mauricio Ramirez, 17, who has found a meat processing job in the next 
town over.

``Not What I Imagined''

It has been a little more than a year since Carolina left Guatemala, 
and she has started to make some friends. She and another girl who 
works at Hearthside have necklaces that fit together, each strung with 
half a heart. When she has time, she posts selfies online decorated 
with smiley faces and flowers.

Mostly, though, she keeps to herself. Her teachers do not know many 
details about her journey to the border. When the topic came up at 
school recently, Carolina began sobbing and would not say why.

After a week of 17-hour days, she sat at home one night with her aunt 
and considered her life in the United States. The long nights. The 
stress about money. ``I didn't have expectations about what life would 
be like here,'' she said, ``but it's not what I imagined.''

She was holding a debit card given to her by a staffing agency, which 
paid her Hearthside salary this way so she did not have to cash checks. 
Carolina turned it over and over in her palm as her aunt looked on.

``I know you get sad,'' Ms. Ramirez said.

Carolina looked down. She wanted to continue going to school to learn 
English, but she woke up most mornings with a clenched stomach and kept 
staying home sick. Some of her ninth grade classmates had already 
dropped out. The 16-year-old boy she sat next to in math class, 
Cristian Lopez, had left school to work overtime at Hearthside.

Cristian lived a few minutes away, in a bare two-room apartment he 
shared with his uncle and 12-year-old sister, Jennifer.

His sister did not go to school either, and they had spent the day 
bickering in their room. Now night had fallen and they were eating 
Froot Loops for dinner. The heat was off, so they wore winter jackets. 
In an interview from Guatemala, their mother, Isabel Lopez, cried as 
she explained that she had tried to join her children in the United 
States last year but was turned back at the border.

Cristian had given his uncle some of the money he earned making Chewy 
bars, but his uncle believed it was not enough. He had said he would 
like Jennifer to start working at the factory as well, and offered to 
take her to apply himself.

Cristian said he had recently called the H.H.S. hotline. He hoped the 
government would send someone to check on him and his sister, but he 
had not heard back. He did not think he would call again.

                                 ______
                                 
                Prepared Statement of Hon. Mike Crapo, 
                       a U.S. Senator From Idaho
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Secretary Becerra, for 
being here today.

    I do want to respond to the question of the debt ceiling 
negotiations. I want to make it very clear, the Republicans are asking 
for negotiations on the debt ceiling process, to add some fiscal 
restraint into the debt ceiling extension. I ask you, Secretary 
Becerra, to take back to the President my plea that he engage with us 
in negotiations.

    I want to make it clear, we are not talking about trying to reduce 
benefits in Medicare or Social Security for our seniors. What we are 
talking about is reasonable reforms that can help us get to some kind 
of fiscal restraint on our spiraling debt. I encourage all of my 
colleagues in the Senate, but particularly the President, to engage 
with those kinds of negotiations.

    I want to start my formal remarks on the positive. You have 
testified before and talked to me privately about the fact that 
although we have our differences on a lot of different policy areas, we 
want to find those areas where we can work together, and we found some 
last year.

    Late last year, we came together on a package of bipartisan reforms 
to produce common-sense solutions, ranging from mental health 
improvements to comprehensive telehealth coverage for seniors and 
working families. Moreover, we accomplished all of this while reducing 
the deficit by billions of dollars.

    Fortunately, the administration supports these policies, and I look 
forward to partnering with the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS), as well as with my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, to advance additional reforms that improve health-care access, 
affordability, and choice for all Americans. That being said, I do have 
concerns with the budget the President has put forward.

    Unfortunately, many of the proposals in the President's budget run 
directly counter to these types of initiatives. I have serious concerns 
with the focus on partisan policies that risk harming health-care 
access and affordability, for both current and future patients. The 
budget's central proposal, for instance, would dramatically expand the 
size and scope of the bureaucratic, government-run drug price-setting 
program enacted under last year's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

    Prior to that law's passage, my Republican colleagues and I warned 
repeatedly that imposing sweeping price controls would prove disastrous 
for patients, biomedical research and development, and domestic 
manufacturing jobs. Many of our fears have already come to pass.

    We pointed to the risk of higher launch prices and distorted 
pricing practices, based on projections validated by the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office. And sure enough, The Wall Street Journal 
reported in January, and I quote, ``The impact in 2023 may actually be 
higher drug prices.'' We also expressed concerns around lifesaving R&D, 
as a University of Chicago study estimated the IRA would result in 135 
fewer new drug approvals in the next 2 decades. That figure would 
inevitably skyrocket under the budget's proposed expansion. Already, 
numerous manufacturers have signaled plans to table certain projects in 
light of the uncertainty created by the IRA.

    In recent months, we have also seen a rash of drug shortages, which 
even leading U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials have 
attributed to pricing dynamics. Doubling down on the IRA's price 
controls would exacerbate the law's most harmful consequences. 
Americans deserve better and more affordable access to prescription 
drugs, and we can find bipartisan, results-oriented solutions this year 
to advance that goal. Government price mandates, however, are a step in 
the wrong direction.

    I also have profound concerns with the budget's bold claims of 
averting the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund's looming 
insolvency, largely through massive tax hikes and budget gimmicks. This 
unbalanced approach does nothing to address Medicare's cost drivers. It 
would also punish the small business job creators and entrepreneurs who 
drive our economy.

    Unfortunately, the budget takes a similarly shortsighted approach 
to Medicaid, reviving a number of rejected policies from past 
proposals, including hundreds of billions in new spending, tied to 
burdensome conditions and efforts to circumvent State leaders.

    The Federal Government should focus on supporting States as they 
work to return Medicaid to post-pandemic normalcy, rather than imposing 
new top-down mandates. Instead of turning to one-size-fits-all 
solutions, we should look to proven models for Federal programs, such 
as Medicare Advantage. With sky-high patient satisfaction rates, 
Medicare Advantage shows that consumer choice and market forces can 
produce more benefits and better outcomes.

    As we move forward, I encourage your Department, Mr. Secretary, to 
focus on our many shared goals, from cost-cutting competition to 
sustainable telehealth access, rather than on partisan priorities.

    Thank you again for being here today, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                                 ______

              Our Law Helps Patients Get New Drugs Sooner

                      By Birch Bayh and Bob Dole *
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * The writers are, respectively, a former Democratic senator from 
Indiana and a former Republican Senator from Kansas.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As co-authors of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, we must comment on the 
March 27 op-ed article by Peter Arno and Michael Davis about this law.

Government alone has never developed the new advances in medicines and 
technology that become commercial products. For that, our country 
relies on the private sector. The purpose of our act was to spur the 
interaction between public and private research so that patients would 
receive the benefits of innovative science sooner.

For every $1 spent in government research on a project, at least $10 of 
industry development will be needed to bring a product to market. 
Moreover, the rare 
government-funded inventions that become products are typically five to 
seven years away from being commercial products when private industry 
gets involved. This is because almost all universities and government 
labs are conducting early-stage research.

Bayh-Dole did not intend that government set prices on resulting 
products. The law makes no reference to a reasonable price that should 
be dictated by the government. This omission was intentional; the 
primary purpose of the act was to entice the private sector to seek 
public-private research collaboration rather than focusing on its own 
proprietary research.

The article also mischaracterized the rights retained by the government 
under Bayh-Dole. The ability of the government to revoke a license 
granted under the act is not contingent on the pricing of a resulting 
product or tied to the profitability of a company that has 
commercialized a product that results in part from government-funded 
research. The law instructs the government to revoke such licenses only 
when the private industry collaborator has not successfully 
commercialized the invention as a product.

The law we passed is about encouraging a partnership that spurs 
advances to help Americans. We are proud to say it's working.

 Updated: Eli Lilly Blames Biden's IRA for Cancer Drug Discontinuation 
                 as the New Pharma Playbook Takes Shape

            By Max Gelman,<SUP><dagger></SUP> Senior Editor
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \<dagger>\ https://endpts.com/author/max-gelman/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eli Lilly laid blame Tuesday afternoon on President Joe Biden's 
Inflation Reduction Act as the reason it scrapped a $40-million cancer 
drug.

As part of its third quarter update earlier Tuesday morning, the Big 
Pharma revealed it had removed a Phase I drug licensed from Fosun 
Pharma, a BCL2 inhibitor that had been undergoing studies for a variety 
of blood cancers. Though the reasoning had been initially unclear, an 
Eli Lilly spokesperson told Endpoints News in an email that ``in light 
of the Inflation Reduction Act, this program no longer met our 
threshold for continued investment.''

Asked to explain how the IRA impacted this specific drug, the 
spokesperson highlighted the law's impact on small molecule R&D.

``The IRA changes many dynamics for small molecules in oncology and 
when we integrated those changes with this program and its competitive 
landscape, the program's future investment no longer met our 
threshold,'' the spokesperson told Endpoints in a follow-up email.

The Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law over the 
summer, contains provisions allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for 
certain high-cost drugs. Starting in 2026, the HHS Secretary will 
select drugs from a list of the highest-selling Medicare Part D and, 
later on, Part B medicines for which the agency will be allowed to set 
a ``maximum fair price.''

For small molecules, the government can begin negotiating prices after 
the drugs have been on the market for at least 9 years. The drugs would 
also have to be among the top therapies Medicare pays for. Critics of 
the law have said beginning negotiations at the nine-year mark will 
hamper innovation, because pharma companies obtain 13 years of market 
exclusivity--a threshold which remains in place with the IRA.

Lilly's decision comes a few days after Alnylam noted the IRA in a 
press release, tying it to the legislation to a decision ending Phase 
III plans for vutrisiran in the rare Stargardt disease. In this 
instance, Alnylam emphasized the orphan drug exemption for the IRA's 
drug price caps, in which therapies are exempt from Medicare 
negotiations if approved for only one designation.

Earlier this year, the FDA approved vutrisiran, branded as Amvuttra, to 
treat hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis. Alnylam 
lists the price at $463,500 per patient per year, and the drug pulled 
in about $25 million in its first quarter on the market.

The Lilly drug, dubbed LOXO-338, was far from any regulatory decision. 
Researchers were testing it as a monotherapy in Phase I studies and it 
would have progressed to a combination cohort had safety and efficacy 
been confirmed, according to the federal government's clinical trials 
database.

Lilly expected to enroll more than 300 patients, as of the trial's most 
recent update on October 12.th Started in August 2021, the study was 
supposed to observe patients' response rates over the course of two 
years and report data in 2024. But with Lilly dropping the program, 
it's not clear what will happen to patients who have already taken the 
experimental drug.

Lilly licensed LOXO-338 from Fosun Pharma in October 2020, nabbing the 
rights to the drug everywhere but China for $40 million. On top of 
that, Fosun had been eligible for up to $400 million in milestones and 
mid-to-high single-digit royalty payments on any approvals.

Additionally, Lilly abandoned another pipeline program Tuesday, a 
PACAP38-
targeting antibody known as LY3451838. According to previous SEC 
filings, researchers had been testing the drug in a Phase II study for 
chronic pain since November 2020. But in August, Lilly updated the 
indication to migraines.

Per the trial database, the Phase II trial was completed this past 
September. A press release from Lilly Neuroscience said the study ``did

With earnings season in full swing, Lilly isn't the only Big Pharma 
company to cull programs from its pipeline. Last month, Roche chopped a 
Phase II eye disease candidate after a biotech tossed a similar drug 
the day before, and Novartis indefinitely postponed plans to submit an 
FDA pitch for its PD-1 drug. GSK made a broad retreat from NY-ESO as a 
cancer target when it pulled out of two cell therapy 2.0 alliances, 
while AbbVie discarded an autoimmune drug, the product of a 10-year 
discovery partnership.

    Alnylam Halts Work on Eye Drug, Citing New U.S. Law Over Pricing

      Drugmaker had planned to expand drug's use for eye disease
      New drug-price negotiation law cited as disincentive

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc.\2\ said it's stopping work on a treatment 
for a rare eye disease because of a new U.S. drug-pricing law with the 
potential to limit how much it could charge for the medication in the 
future.

Alnylam will not begin a planned late-stage trial of its drug Amvuttra 
for Stargardt disease, which causes blindness, while it examines the 
Inflation Reduction Act, the company said Thursday in its third-quarter 
earnings statement.\3\ The shares fell 2.7% as of 10:47 a.m. in New 
York.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/RKEUO0MEWG7T.

Under the act, the U.S. Government will be able to negotiate prices for 
a small subset of drugs in the Medicare program for seniors. The law 
targets drugs that Medicare spends the most money on and have been on 
the market for years, and drug companies like Alnylam have argued that 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
it discourages investment in new medicines.

Amvuttra is already approved to treat a rare disease called 
transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, and Alnylam was exploring Stargardt 
disease as a second indication. The company charges $463,500 per 
patient a year for the drug and in the third quarter, its first full 
quarter on the market, the company reported $25 million in revenue from 
it.

Alnylam isn't moving forward with adding the second indication because 
the act exempts drugs with one rare-disease use from price 
negotiations. The list of drugs subject to negotiations is limited to 
the 50 Medicare spends the most money on by 2029, and it's not clear 
whether Amvuttra would fall into that category.

Alnylam is ``still digesting the legislation,'' said Yvonne 
Greenstreet, chief executive officer of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-
based company, said Thursday on a call discussing the earnings results. 
Management has considerable concerns about the legislation, she said.

Greenstreet said Alnylam remains interested in Stargardt disease, which 
is estimated \4\ to affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. and 
causes progressive vision loss. She said the company is still trying to 
figure out the best path forward.

                 Prepared Statement of Hon. Ron Wyden, 
                       a U.S. Senator From Oregon
    The Finance Committee meets this morning with Secretary Becerra to 
discuss the year ahead for the Department of Health and Human Services. 
The President's budget comes down to a simple proposition: helping 
working families and the middle class get ahead and reducing the 
deficit are not mutually exclusive.

    When it comes to health care, that means protecting Medicare for 
the next generation by asking the wealthy to pay their fair share in 
taxes; strengthening Medicare's negotiating power for the cost of 
prescription drugs; and investing in priorities like mental health 
care, home-based care, and the health-care workforce.

    That's a sharp contrast to the Republican approach to the Federal 
budget since the beginning of this year, which amounts to demanding 
secret negotiations on unspecified cuts to Federal programs while 
holding hostage the full faith and credit of the United States 
Government.

    Budget Committee Chair Whitehouse and I asked the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office to run the numbers, and it's clear that 
Republican promises to spare certain parts of the budget like Social 
Security and Medicare just don't add up. Sparing essential lifelines 
for seniors in addition to Republican priorities like extending the 
Trump tax law means essentially zeroing out everything else in the 
Federal budget.

    I want to take a moment to address reports that some members are 
considering proposals that cut earned benefits in Medicare or Social 
Security for those who are not yet at retirement age. Let me be very 
clear: as long as I'm chairman of the Finance Committee, I will fight 
any effort to engage in intergenerational warfare. There are plenty of 
ideas to improve the financial health of these programs that do not 
include forfeiting the earned benefits of current workers.

    Now I'm going to take a minute to talk about what cuts like these 
mean in practical terms, starting with Medicaid. Contrary to popular 
belief, Medicaid acts as the Nation's backstop for nursing home care, 
not Medicare. That means when your parents are in their 80s or 90s and 
require nursing home care, Medicaid is there to help cover the cost 
once they've spent down their hard-earned savings over the course of 
their retirement.

    If Republicans go after Medicaid the way they did in 2017, by 
cutting Federal support to State Medicaid programs and giving States 
free reign to pare back benefits, that guaranteed backstop of nursing 
home care in old age is ripped away. That means a return to times from 
distant memory before the social safety net was created, when older 
Americans who ran out of savings and couldn't count on a family member 
for help were consigned to poor farms or almshouses.

    Colleagues, none of us wants America to return to that time. So 
let's look for ways to work together to take on the big health 
challenges of the day, rather than pursuing reckless cuts that imperil 
American seniors.

    I want to briefly tick through some important priorities in the 
President's HHS budget.

    First, on prescription drugs, the President's budget has several 
bold proposals to build on the Inflation Reduction Act that will hold 
big pharma accountable for years of high prices, while lowering costs 
for seniors. That includes speeding up Medicare negotiation and 
increasing the number of drugs subject to negotiation each year. I 
support this approach, especially as the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) continues to steadily implement the laws that 
are already on the books.

    Just last week, the Biden administration announced that the anti-
price-gouging law written in this committee on a bipartisan basis in 
2019 will lower coinsurance payments for 27 drugs in Medicare Part B. 
Part B pays for prescription drugs to treat diseases like cancer and 
rheumatoid arthritis administered in the doctor's office. That includes 
Humira, which is Exhibit A for why drug pricing reforms were needed in 
the first place. Important steps like these--coinsurance reductions, 
free vaccines, and the insulin cost cap in Medicare--are just the 
beginning of the big league impact this law will have on Americans' 
health costs.

    Next, mental health care. Last Congress, this committee wrote black 
letter law to move the country towards a reality where all Americans 
can get quality mental health care when and where they need it, and I 
thank Senator Crapo for making sure it was a bipartisan effort 
throughout. I'm proud that this committee included a number of 
important policies in bipartisan bills, like improved mental health 
care in schools, funding for community behavioral health centers--a 
longstanding priority for Senator Stabenow--coverage for therapists in 
Medicare, and new GME slots for psychiatrists. Despite that important 
work last year, every member of this committee knows there is more to 
be done. I intend to work with Ranking Member Crapo to enact the 
remaining policies that members of this committee put so much sweat 
equity into.

    When it comes to mental health parity, Congress passed a landmark 
law in 2008 based on the proposition that mental health and physical 
health should be treated equally. That's not happening today. Fifteen 
years after the law was written, insurance companies are still finding 
ways to drag their feet. So the challenge for this committee is to stop 
the foot-dragging under current law, and develop fresh approaches to 
give Americans what they thought they were getting in 2008. The 
President's budget takes important steps in that direction, and I'm 
proud to be working with Senator Bennet to put mental health care on a 
better footing.

    I'm also pleased to see the President's budget take a big step when 
it comes to postpartum coverage for new mothers in Medicaid. At the end 
of last year, Congress came together on a bipartisan basis to create an 
option for every State to cover postpartum care for new mothers for 12 
months. The President's budget takes the next step to make that 
coverage available across the entire country. That's critically 
important at the time when maternal mortality is rising, particularly 
for Black women.

    Before I wrap up, I want to talk about one more critically 
important priority--long-term care. Right now, millions of seniors and 
Americans with disabilities are falling through the cracks, as recently 
reported in The Washington Post. It's high time to develop smart 
policies that provide several long-term care options to families to get 
the care that's best for their loved ones. One option is home and 
community-based care, which the President's budget proposes to expand 
in Medicaid. For too many of our fellow Americans who count on Medicaid 
for long-term care, it's not possible to receive that type of care with 
the current laws on the books. Senator Casey has been a champion of 
this effort on the Finance Committee, and I'm proud to call myself his 
partner. It's long past time to expand this coverage under Medicaid.

    I'm pleased to see so many smart investments in this budget in 
high-priority policies that will improve health care for Americans with 
coverage under Medicare, Medicaid, and ACA marketplaces.

    Thank you for joining the committee this morning, Secretary 
Becerra. There's a lot to discuss today, so I look forward to speaking 
with you in the Q&A.

                    Statement of Michael G. Bindner

Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo, thank you for the opportunity 
to submit these comments for the record on the HHS FY 2024 budget 
request.

I have put out previous comments on orphan drugs, examining lessons 
learned from the pandemic that need to be noted, mental health 
hospitalization, getting to single-payer and establishing a Medicare 
Part E for Senior Medicaid and other long term care in the attachments.

These comments will restate my upcoming testimony to the Labor, HHS and 
Education Appropriations Subcommittee and the House Budget Committee. I 
have not pulled any punches.

From LHHSE:

Developing the Public Option needs to be funded in this budget. 
Particularly, it should explore the impacts on coverage and cost of 
automatically enrolling individuals who are denied coverage under pre-
existing condition rules. Such rules must be revoked as the price of 
passing the bill. Such a trade-off is necessary for enactment of such a 
proposal on a bipartisan basis. Healthcare reform should only be done 
in this way. Among our other proposals is to fund healthcare spending 
through an employer paid subtraction value added tax. This would allow 
for the repeal of the ACA-SM surtax on higher-income individuals 
enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act.

From the Budget Committee Comments (PB proposals are in boldface):

 Extend ACA premium support permanently, extend low cost care in states 
                    that have not expanded Medicaid

ACA subsidies are too low and are funded by taxing the wrong people 
(investors). Families in the Silver Plan still have problems meeting 
copays and paying premiums. The funding is also unfortunate. Rather 
than expanding Medicaid, replace it for the non-elderly with the Public 
Option proposed in 2009. The public option should also be extended to 
individuals who are denied coverage under pre-existing condition rules. 
Such rules must be revoked as the price of passing the bill. Such a 
trade-off is necessary for enactment of such a proposal on a bipartisan 
basis.

 Extends Medicare Solvency: Strengthen Medicare by increasing NIIT 
                    (ACA-SM) and limiting pass through income reforms

As above, taxes to support Medicare should be broad based, funded 
either by an employer paid subtraction VAT or a border adjustable goods 
and services tax (credit invoice VAT). This would allow for the repeal 
of the ACA-SM surtax on higher income individuals enacted as part of 
the Affordable Care Act. Tax increases on higher-income individuals 
should be dedicated toward fully funding net interest, eventually 
reducing the national debt, funding veterans' health care and overseas 
military and ocean deployments.

State governments were under financial pressure as a result of the 
pandemic, especially in the area of healthcare costs, most especially 
for seniors in nursing homes who are ``dual eligibles.'' The heart of 
President Reagan's Federalism Proposal was the transfer of state 
Medicaid expenses to the federal government, largely to fund baby 
boomers who would become dual eligible with time. Time is now up, or 
will be shortly.

Welfare has been reformed, allowing state and federal governments to 
save money--which was part of the New Federalism bargain that was not 
accepted at the time. We will address this part shortly, but the irony 
is that federal money was reduced without the second part of the trade-
off. Finish the process and create Medicare Part E for low income 
disabled and retirees.

The way to fully fund healthcare is through an employer-paid 
subtraction value-added tax.

 From Tax Reform Attachment: Subtraction Value-Added Taxes

Subtraction Value-Added Tax (S-VAT). Corporate income taxes and 
collection of business and farm income taxes will be replaced by this 
tax, which is an employer paid Net Business Receipts Tax. S-VAT is a 
vehicle for tax benefits, including:

      Health insurance or direct care, including veterans' health care 
for non-
battlefield injuries and long-term care.
      Employer paid educational costs in lieu of taxes are provided as 
either 
employee-directed contributions to the public or private unionized 
school of their choice or direct tuition payments for employee children 
or for workers (including ESL and remedial skills). Wages will be paid 
to students to meet opportunity costs.
      Most importantly, a refundable child tax credit at median income 
levels (with inflation adjustments) distributed with pay.

Subsistence-level benefits force the poor into servile labor. Wages and 
benefits must be high enough to provide justice and human dignity. This 
allows the ending of state administered subsidy programs and 
discourages abortions, and as such enactment must be scored as a must 
pass in voting rankings by pro-life organizations (and feminist 
organizations as well). To assure child subsidies are distributed, S-
VAT will not be border adjustable.

As above, S-VAT surtaxes are collected on all income distributed over 
$75,000, with a beginning rate of 6.25%. replace income tax levies 
collected on the first surtaxes in the same range. Some will use 
corporations to avoid these taxes, but that corporation would then pay 
all invoice and subtraction VAT payments (which would distribute tax 
benefits). Distributions from such corporations will be considered 
salary, not dividends.

The President has punted on reforming Social Security. This is a 
mistake--although Chairman Smith and the Majority will not like this 
proposal--probably because it would work and take the topic off of the 
table.

Individual payroll taxes. A floor of $20,000 would be instituted for 
paying these taxes, with a ceiling of $75,000. This lower ceiling 
reduces the amount of benefits received in retirement for higher-income 
individuals. The logic of the $20,000 floor reflects full time work at 
a $10 per hour minimum wage offered by the Republican caucus in 
response to proposals for a $15 wage. Any increase to the minimum wage 
must fully cover tipped workers. The White House/Senate Majority/House 
Minority needs to take the deal. Doing so in relation to a floor on 
contributions makes adopting the minimum wage germane in the Senate for 
purposes of Reconciliation. The rate would be set at 6.25%.

Employer payroll taxes. Unless taxes are diverted to a personal 
retirement account holding voting and preferred stock in the employer, 
the employer levy would be replaced by a goods and receipts tax of 
6.25%. Every worker who meets a minimum hour threshold would be 
credited for having paid into the system, regardless of wage level. All 
employees would be credited on an equal dollar basis, rather than as a 
match to their individual payroll tax. The tax rate would be adjusted 
to assure adequacy of benefits for all program beneficiaries.

Thank you for the opportunity to address the committee. We are, of 
course, available for direct testimony or to answer questions by 
members and staff.

Attachment One--HHS Budget FY 2023

Orphan Drugs

Part of ARPA-H is the funding for research on orphan drugs and the 
lingering problem of their cost once research leads to product 
development. In comments to Senate Finance on March 16, 2022, we 
repeated our proposal in this area for NIH to retain ownership in any 
such drug and contract out its further development and manufacture. 
Keeping ownership in public hands ends the need for drug companies to 
charge extreme prices or increase prices for its existing formulary to 
fund development.

Pharma would still make reasonable profit, but the government would eat 
the risk and sometimes reap the rewards. NIH/FDA might even break even 
in the long term, especially if large volume drugs which were developed 
with government grants must pay back a share of basic research costs 
and the attached profits, as well as regulatory cost.

Pandemic Lessons

On the pandemic, we urge that there be a public examination of lessons 
learned--particularly mistakes. The largest mistake was to not identify 
COVID-19 as being spread like a cold.

Subsequent variants identified sneezing and a runny nose as early signs 
of the virus. This was true in the first round, but to save face, it 
was not mentioned and is still not admitted. Job one of preparing for 
the next coronavirus pandemic is to list cold or supposed allergy 
symptoms as the signal to self-quarantine (if not be quarantined).

Donald Trump did not kill a million people. Trying to downplay original 
symptoms did--which led to a loss of credibility among some 
populations. This social aspect must also be explored--especially if 
these populations are to comply with later instructions.

Mental Health Hospitalization

The President's proposals to expand behavioral health are most welcome, 
although only a start. Replacing mental health facilities--as well as 
policies which allow longer-term mandatory stays are what is needed--
including conditions whereby readmission to a more controlled 
environment is automatic in the event of relapse or medication non-
compliance.

Such a change in the rules of the game will demand 50-state 
cooperation, as local laws are impacted. The Department of Justice and 
state and local police agency participation is also required. Reform 
cannot only be for those with insurance--it must be for everyone. 
Parity is not enough--and is impossible without not only more beds--but 
more dedicated hospitals.

Attachment Two--HHS Budget FY 2022

Single Payer

We address the funding of the Affordable Care Act, the need for an 
immediate COLA for retirees, funding the Social Security 
Administration's non-fund costs and the idea of cost savings for Social 
Security.

So far, the Administration has not yet addressed changes to the 
Affordable Care Act, at least not publicly. We suggest that the 
Committee ask the Secretary about any such plans.

At minimum, the individual and employer mandates, with associated 
penalties, that were repealed must be restored. The President 
campaigned on restoring and perfecting the Act, adding a public option. 
We agree, although the public option need not be self-supporting. It 
must be subsidized through a broad-based consumption tax. Such a tax 
burdens both capital and wage income.

The current funding stream seems to have been designed to draw 
opposition from wealthier taxpayers. It is an open secret that the 
Minority does not oppose most of the Affordable Care Act (which was 
designed by their own Heritage Foundation as an alternative to Mrs. 
Clinton's proposals). Broaden the tax base to fund the program and the 
nonsense on repeal will end.

The current funding stream from student loan initiation and interest, 
which was included in the baseline, should also be ended. Graduates 
(and non-graduates) with student loan debt cannot afford both their 
loan payments and insurance payments under the Affordable Care Act. 
When they apply for lower loan payments, which are always granted, they 
face either a balloon interest payment or capitalized interest, which 
makes their funding situation worse. No one should have to retire with 
student load debt, yet quite a few soon will (or already have).

Forgive capitalized interest and apply any overpayments to principal. 
There should not be a one-size-fits-all subsidy. Also, when payments 
are deferred, return to the practice of deferring interest (or allow 
debts to be discharged, at least partially, in bankruptcy).

To deal with these issues, whatever is budgeted for analytical support 
in the Department should likely be doubled.

The following analysis comes from the Single Payer attachment that has 
previously been provided. Because of the President's preference for 
establishing the public option, we will repeat those analyses here. 
Aside from a broader base of funding, other compromises are necessary 
to enact a public option.

To set up a public option end protection for pre-existing conditions 
and mandates, the public option would then cover all families who are 
rejected for either pre-
existing conditions or the inability to pay. In essence, this is an 
expansion of Medicaid to everyone with a pre-existing condition. As 
such, it would be funded through increased taxation, which will be 
addressed below. A variation is the expansion of the Uniformed Public 
Health Service to treat such individuals and their families.

The public option is inherently unstable over the long term. The profit 
motive will ultimately make the exclusion pool grow until private 
insurance would no longer be justified, leading-again to Single Payer 
if the race to cut customers leads to no one left in private insurance 
who is actually sick. This eventually becomes Medicare for All, but 
with easier passage and sudden adoption as private health plans are 
either banned or become bankrupt. Single-payer would then be what 
occurs when insurance companies are bailed out in bankruptcy, the 
public option covers everyone and insurance companies are limited to 
administering the government program on a state by state basis.

The financing of the Affordable Care Act should be broadened. It should 
neither be funded by the wealthy or by loan-sharking student loan 
debtors. Instead, it should be funded by an employer-paid consumption 
tax, with partial offsets to tax payments for employer provided 
insurance and taxes actually collected funding a Public Option (which 
should also replace Medicaid for non-retirees). Medicaid for retirees 
and Medicare should be funded by a border adjustable goods and services 
tax, which should be broad based.

Why the difference? The goal is to not need a public option as 
employers do the right thing and cover every worker or potential 
worker. Using an employer-based tax is an incentive to maximize 
employee coverage. Medicare, however, is an obligation on society as a 
whole.

Medicare Part E

State governments are under financial pressure as a result of the 
pandemic, especially in the area of healthcare costs, most especially 
for seniors in nursing homes who are ``dual-eligibles.'' The heart of 
President Reagan's New Federalism proposal was the transfer of state 
Medicaid expenses to the federal government, largely to fund baby 
boomers who would become dual eligible with time. Time is now up, or 
will be shortly.

Welfare has been reformed, allowing state and federal governments to 
save money--which was part of the New Federalism bargain that was not 
accepted at the time. We will address this part shortly, but the irony 
is that federal money was reduced without the second part of the trade-
off.

Finish the process and create Medicare Part E for low-income disabled 
and retirees. This will put investigation of nursing home conditions 
into the federal sector. States have done a poor job in enforcement of 
health and safety standards. It is time to make this a national 
responsibility.

One way to increase benefits generally is to increase the minimum wage, 
the higher the better, and rebase current benefits to consider such an 
increase to be wage inflation. Such a change will fund itself, because 
wages funding benefits will be increased across the board.

Re: Full Committee Hearing: ``The President's Fiscal Year 2024 Health 
and Human Services Budget''

Dear Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo:

On behalf of patients with chronic conditions, the Chronic Care Policy 
Alliance urges the Finance Committee to utilize hearings on the 2024 
Health and Human Services Budget as an opportunity to ensure 
accountability and oversight as that department implements the health 
policies included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). 
Additionally, we recommend that legislators prevent further changes to 
the new Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, including those 
proposed by the Biden Administration in the budget for fiscal year 
2024, until the IRA has been fully implemented and the impact of these 
policy changes are known and understood.

The health policies in the IRA took great strides to lower patient 
costs and included many beneficial policies that will provide immediate 
relief to patients including out-of-pocket caps, capping the costs of 
insulin, and eliminating cost sharing for vaccines. However, the long-
term impact of other provisions of the law, including the Medicare Drug 
Price Negotiation Program, remains unknown and could impede the 
development of new treatments and limit patients' ability to access new 
therapies in years to come.

We were joined by 36 organizations in sending the below letter to 
Congress and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 
further explaining these concerns and urging that CMS ensure patient 
advocates have ample opportunity to weigh-in throughout and after IRA 
implementation to limit any negative impact on patients.

Further, given the uncertainty around the Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program and other provisions of the IRA, we would urge that 
Congress reject any proposals to accelerate the scope of the 
negotiation program. The Biden Administration's proposed budget 
included proposal to substantially increase the number of drugs on 
which CMS can negotiate starting in 2026, and making drugs subject to 
negotiation much sooner. According to press reports, this proposal 
could double the number of drugs negotiated each year and make drugs 
subject to negotiation after only 5 years after FDA approval instead of 
the current 9-13 year time frame.

This expansion of an untested policy could lead to disastrous results 
for patients by significantly limiting access to current and future 
therapies. The impact could also significantly hinder research for 
patients with complex or rare diseases that require intricate treatment 
regimes.

We appreciate the Finance Committee's ongoing work and oversight to 
ensure that patients are protected as these new policies are 
implemented and look forward to staying in close touch throughout the 
implementation process.

Sincerely,

Liz Helms
Founder/Director

36 organizations urging Congress and the Administration to ensure that 
patient advocates have a seat at the table throughout the 
implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act's health policies. CCPA

unintended consequences by asking for patient input in the planning

Dear Congress:

As patient representatives, we advocate on behalf of patient interests 
and interpret how certain policies will positively or negatively affect 
them. Patients know firsthand the benefits of a strong health care 
system that provides access to new and groundbreaking treatments. In 
recent years, we have seen great strides in the treatment of ALS, 
cancer and Alzheimer's disease that have increased life span, slowed 
the ravage of disease and improved the quality of lives.

Last year, Congress passed significant policies within the Inflation 
Reduction Act (IRA) focused specifically on patient costs. We were 
especially pleased by the improvements to Medicare Part D that included 
adding an out-of-pocket cap, establishing a $35 limit on monthly 
insulin costs, and eliminating cost sharing for vaccines. These 
policies will provide immediate relief to patients. Thank you.

However, other policies around prescription drug prices faced 
significant debate during the legislative process. Policymakers must 
keep in mind the unknown long-term impacts on the development of new 
treatments--especially those for complex and rare diseases--and 
patients' ability to access those new therapies.

Now it is time for the real work as the Administration begins the 
lengthy process of implementing IRA's policies. We urge Congress to 
continue oversight throughout the implementation process and insist 
that patient voices are heard.

The Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program contained in the law seeks 
to establish negotiated rates, or the Maximum Fair Price (MFP), for 
medications. While focused on reducing drug costs, the unintended 
negative consequences for drug coverage, formulary priority, access and 
further research and development could harm patients. For example, as 
new prices are determined, payors may favor products on their 
formularies that have a negotiated price. This could ultimately make 
other medications more difficult to access as payors encourage use of 
these negotiated price medications and discourage others. Payors 
already utilize cost saving measures that negatively impact patients 
such as restrictive formularies, step therapy and strict prior 
authorizations. Patients need access to the correct treatments, or they 
will suffer. The addition of products with artificially lowered prices 
is likely to create yet another restrictive process for patients.

We urge Congress to ensure that regulators at CMS create specific 
opportunities for patient advocates to participate in the regulatory 
process.

Our specific recommendations include:

      Host regional roundtables to solicit feedback from patients. We 
strongly recommend that CMS create a structure similar to that used to 
implement the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and utilize the CMS regional 
staff to hold patient-centered roundtable discussions throughout the 
country to ensure that patients have the opportunity to share their 
experiences and insights directly with CMS, regardless of their 
physical location. Providing regional opportunities is particularly 
important in the patient community where resources may make 
participation at the federal level more of a challenge than in their 
state and local communities.
      Release draft guidance, solicit written comments. We are pleased 
that CMS has announced that it will issue draft guidance that seeks 
public input on key provisions of the MFP program. We hope that the 
draft guidance includes and seeks feedback on the process, including 
the methodology CMS uses to determine the MFP. Soliciting written 
comments from the public is critical.
      Develop patient-centered criteria. CMS should also develop, with 
significant input from patients, patient-centered criteria that must be 
adhered to as CMS implements the drug pricing provisions. This will 
ensure patient perspectives are heard and patient needs are 
prioritized. The ACA required that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid 
Innovation develop similar criteria.
      Meaningfully engage patients in determining the MFP for each 
drug. Patient advocates can offer both substantial and critical 
perspectives as CMS considers what a price should be for a specific 
drug. CMS should create a process through which it will consistently 
and meaningfully engage with patients determining each drug's price, 
and ensure they have a say in the outcome.
      Study the impact of the drug pricing provisions on patients. CMS 
should study the impact that negotiation has on patients prior to 
negotiation, focusing on issues related to access to current and future 
therapies. For example, CMS should study the impact of the drug pricing 
provisions on Medicare Part D coverage, including formulary placement 
and utilization management.

Founding Director, CCPA at lizh@chroniccarealliance.org. Thank you for 
your time and attention to these critical issues.

U.S. Senate
Committee on Finance
Hon. Ron Wyden
Chairman
Hon. Mike Crapo
Ranking Member
219 Dirksen Senate Office Building
Washington, DC 20510

Dear Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo:

On behalf of the Digital Therapeutics Alliance (DTA), we want to take 
this opportunity to thank you and the members of the Senate Committee 
on Finance for convening a committee hearing on Wednesday, March 22, 
2023 on ``The President's Fiscal Year 2024 Health and Human Services 
Budget.'' During the hearing the committee focused on various aspects 
of President Biden's HHS budget.

We write to the committee today to voice our support for key aspects of 
the President FY 2024 budget,\1\ specifically a legislative proposal to 
establish Medicare coverage of evidence-based digital applications and 
platforms that facilitate the delivery of behavioral health services, 
especially for beneficiaries who live in rural or health professional 
shortage areas.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2024-budget-in-
brief.pdf.

Digital therapeutics (DTx), a relatively new category of medicine 
that--as HHS requests, ``enables Medicare coverage of evidence-based 
digital applications and platforms that facilitate the delivery of 
mental health services''--deliver therapeutic interventions directly to 
patients using scientifically developed, clinically evaluated software 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
to treat, manage, and prevent diseases and disorders.

We therefore respectfully ask the Department of Health and Human 
Services to respond to Chairman Wyden's previously submitted questions 
for the record on whether CMS can currently reimburse for DTx products 
under existing national or local coverage determination processes, 
potential or existing criteria for DTx product reimbursement, and 
necessary steps to create a new benefit category.

DTx products are subject to rigorous patient-centered core principles 
and are used independently, alongside medications, or in tandem with 
clinician-delivered therapy. They differ from pure lifestyle, wellness, 
adherence, diagnostic, and telehealth products, and are distinct from 
the over 350,000 digital health apps available online.

Digital therapeutics' benefits, however, are currently available in the 
United States only to patients covered by certain private payors and 
select Medicaid plans, and are not available to patients (and their 
clinicians) who receive insurance coverage through Medicare. Without a 
dedicated Medicare benefit category for digital therapeutics, as 
proposed through the Access to Prescription Digital Therapeutics Act 
(S. 723 and H.R. 1458), this healthcare inequity will continue to grow, 
while also limiting the scalability of DTx access to patients covered 
by other commercial and state coverage plans.

We again thank the committee for holding this important hearing and for 
considering the important issues raised during the hearing and by the 
Digital Therapeutics industry. Should you have any further questions or 
issues you would like to discuss, we would be delighted to discuss them 
further with you.

Sincerely,

The President's Fiscal Year 2024 Health and Human Services Budget
Wednesday, March 22, 2023

UNOS supports Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) 
plan to introduce additional reforms into the nation's organ donation 
and transplantation system. We also stand united with HRSA in our 
shared goal to get as many donor organs as possible to patients in need 
while increasing accountability, transparency and oversight.

We welcome a competitive and open bidding process for the next Organ 
Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) contract to advance our 
efforts to save as many lives as possible, as equitably as possible. We 
believe we have the experience and expertise required to best serve the 
nation's patients and to help implement HRSA's proposed initiatives.

Numerous components of HRSA's plan also align with our new action 
agenda, which is a list of specific proposals we outlined earlier this 
year aimed at driving improvement across the system.

We are committed to working with HRSA, U.S. Department of Heath and 
Human Services (HHS), Congress and others who care about this system so 
deeply to assist in carrying out these reforms and to do our part to 
improve how we serve America's organ donors, transplant patients and 
their families.

Dr. Maureen McBride
Interim UNOS CEO
