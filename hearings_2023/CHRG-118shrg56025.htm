                      WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 13, 2023

                              United States Senate,
                                Committee on the Judiciary,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:02 a.m., in 
Room 226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Richard J. 
Durbin, Chair of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Durbin [presiding], Whitehouse, 
Klobuchar, Hirono, Booker, Padilla, Ossoff, Welch, Butler, 
Graham, Grassley, Lee, Cruz, Hawley, Cotton, Kennedy, Tillis, 
and Blackburn.
    Also present: Senators Cardin, Van Hollen, Menendez, Wyden, 
Merkley, and Young.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN,
           A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

    Chair Durbin. The meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee 
will come to order. Today's the 14th nominations hearing of 
this year.
    Including nominations hearings, we've held 35 Full 
Committee hearings, 22 markups. I want to thank the Ranking 
Member, Senator Graham, for his partnership, as well as all the 
Members of the Committee. We've been busy this year. It's one 
of the busiest Committees in the Senate.
    The work continues today. We'll hear from five judicial 
nominees: Nicole Berner, nominated to the Court of Appeals for 
the Fourth Circuit; Adeel Mangi, nominated to the Court of 
Appeals for the Third Circuit; Judge Amy Baggio, nominated to 
the District of Oregon; Judge Crystal Brisco, nominated to the 
Northern District of Indiana; and Judge Gretchen Lund, also 
nominated to the Northern District of Indiana. Congratulations 
to our nominees, and their families.
    I'd like to begin by noting that the circuit court nominees 
on today's first panel would be, quote, ``Firsts on the 
Bench'': Ms. Berner would be the first LGBTQ American to serve 
on the Fourth Circuit, Mr. Mangi would be the first Muslim 
American to serve as judge on a Federal appellate court.
    It is important to recognize these historic milestones, as 
well as the accomplishments and professional experience of all 
the nominees. I expect their exemplary qualifications will be 
the focus of today's hearing.
    Second, each of today's nominees has received blue slips 
from both of their home State Senators. This includes Judges 
Brisco and Lund, who've received blue slips from Senator Young 
and Senator Braun of Indiana. I thank them and the White House 
for working together in good faith to fill these and many other 
vacancies in their State.
    We've seen similar progress in other States. In fact, this 
is the third nominations hearing in a row with at least one 
nominee with a blue slip from a Republican home State Senator. 
I look forward to seeing more of the same in the new year.
    We have several colleagues joining us to introduce 
nominees, but I'll first turn to Ranking Member Graham for 
opening remarks.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LINDSEY O. GRAHAM,
        A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Last night, or 
yesterday, I guess, over 10,000 people showed up at the border. 
And we talk a lot about Ukraine, the President did, and, you 
know, I'm very supportive of funding Ukraine.
    I know we're supposed to be talking about judges here 
today, but the bottom line, to my Democratic colleagues: What's 
enough? At what point do you realize this is a clear and 
present danger to the safety of the United States?
    Last week, the FBI director told this Committee, wherever 
he looks, he sees blinking lights. The threat levels across the 
board, the highest he's ever seen since he's been associated 
with the FBI. That there's a rogue gallery of terrorist groups 
urging an attack on America to pay us back for helping Israel--
that October the 7th, the attack on Israel, barbaric in nature. 
We have to stand with Israel, I get that, but they're trying to 
punish us for standing with Israel.
    So, we've talked a lot about--the President did yesterday, 
never mentioned the border. And, you know, I had sat there with 
President Zelensky talking about the need for Ukraine. I got 
it. If you listen to that interview, it was like there's 
nothing wrong with our border in the eyes of the President. He 
makes glancing remarks about, yes, we need to do more. I'm 
willing to compromise. There's no sense of urgency here. I 
understand why Ukraine needs help sooner rather than later to 
make sure that Putin understands the war is not going to end. 
It's going to continue.
    So, to my Democratic colleagues, you don't have a sense of 
urgency, but we do. Many of us want to help Ukraine, but we 
believe that America's exposed another 9/11 unlike any time 
since 9/11 itself. And we're sitting around doing almost 
nothing about it. So, I'm hoping that things will change, 
because if they don't change, we're taking a great risk to the 
American people at a time when we should be securing our own 
border as well as helping others.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Graham, I would concur with your 
conclusion that the current situation at the border is 
unsustainable. We are now dealing with 10,000 to 11,000 people 
per day. The administration, one spokesman told me, we have the 
capacity for 5,000, at the most. So, you can see the system is 
breaking down by the sheer numbers that are presenting 
themselves.
    In terms of the President's commitment, he stated publicly 
he wanted to be engaged in this negotiation, and I believe 
yesterday a member of his Cabinet sat down with the 
negotiators. I'm not in that room, so I can't say specifically 
who was there. But I will tell you that the effort includes 
Democrats at all levels, and I hope that we can reach a 
reasonable conclusion with the time remaining in this year.
    I will just add, too, that the meeting with President 
Zelensky yesterday was a reminder--the courage and 
determination of the Ukrainian people is virtually endless. 
They will fight to the death, and he made it clear that they 
would. I just hope the United States will keep its word to the 
Ukrainian people to stand by them with this terrible invasion 
that Putin has initiated.
    We now have several colleagues who've joined us to 
introduce today's nominees, and I'll now ask for your 
introductions. First, from Senator Cardin, who is here to 
introduce Ms. Berner.

               STATEMENT OF HON. BENJAMIN CARDIN,
           A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MARYLAND

    Senator Cardin. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman 
Durbin, Ranking Member Graham, thank you for scheduling this 
confirmation hearing.
    Today, I'm pleased to introduce to the Committee Nicole 
Berner of Maryland, who has been nominated by President Biden 
to sit on the U.S. Circuit Court for the Court of Appeals for 
the Fourth Circuit. Ms. Berner has been nominated by President 
Biden to fill the vacancy created by Judge Diana Motz, who took 
senior status in September 2022.
    I was pleased to recommend Nicole Berner's nomination to 
the White House, along with Senator Van Hollen. Ms. Berner 
serves as general counsel to the Service Employees 
International Union, SEIU, where she has practiced as in-house 
counsel since 2006, before becoming general counsel in 2017.
    Previously, she served as staff attorney for Planned 
Parenthood Federation of America, worked as a litigation 
associate at Jenner & Block in Washington, DC, and worked as a 
visiting attorney at Yigal Arnon & Company in Jerusalem, 
Israel, from 1999 to 2000.
    She served as a law clerk for Judge Thelton Henderson of 
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of 
California, and as a law clerk for Judge Betty Fletcher of the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
    She received her J.D., Order of the Coif, from the 
University of California, Berkeley School of Law, and her MPP 
from the Goldman School of Public Policy. She also received her 
B.A., Phi Betta Kappa, from the University of California at 
Berkeley.
    Nicole Berner has been fighting for civil rights and worker 
rights throughout her career, and I'm excited to have her bring 
this experience and deep knowledge of the law to the Federal 
bench. As general counsel of the two-million-member strong 
Service Employees International Union, Ms. Berner oversees the 
work of about 2 dozen lawyers in the legal department, as well 
as engaging and overseeing with about 200 outside attorneys.
    She brings an outstanding track record of fighting for 
working families, including many low-wage service and care 
workers. In this role, she has excelled in a broad range of 
legal skills, including litigation, negotiations, arbitration, 
and advocacy before regulatory bodies, and providing legal 
advice on policy issues and legislation at the State and 
Federal levels. She's filed numerous amicus curiae briefs at 
the Supreme Court, as well as the circuit and district court 
levels.
    She estimates that she has been actively involved in 
hundreds of cases in Federal and State court. She also 
regularly provides advice to her clients on a diverse range of 
legal areas, including criminal law, voting rights, Federal 
preemption, antitrust, bankruptcy, immigration, First 
Amendment, and Affordable Care Act. She has a great breadth of 
experience.
    When looking at Ms. Berner's legal career, a couple of 
things stand out to me, and I'd like to share that with the 
Committee.
    First, she's motivated by desire to ensure full and fair 
access to the courts for all Americans, regardless of their 
social status or financial resources. Indeed, the judicial oath 
that judges take require them to swear to do equal rights to 
the poor and to the rich. She has consistently advocated for 
the interest of historically underrepresented communities.
    Second, as a skilled appellate lawyer, she has organized 
legal strategies to bring her clients' voices to the courts and 
tell their story. She seeks to show how their lives will be 
affected by the outcome of a case. During the COVID-19 
pandemic, for example, she represented frontline workers who 
literally put their lives and health at risk to do their jobs 
and keep our economy running when many Americans were told to 
stay home until a vaccine was developed. Her SEIU clients 
include workers in the fast-growing occupations of public 
service, healthcare, home care, childcare, janitorial, and 
building security.
    Third, she will bring a unique and diverse perspective to 
the appellate court. We know that the Fourth Circuit is a 
particularly diverse circuit that includes the States of 
Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, and South 
Carolina. A more diverse bench will better reflect the 
populations they serve. Nicole brings to the bench both her 
vast experience as an appellate lawyer and her own personal 
advocacy as a Jewish woman on so many civil rights issues.
    Ms. Berner would be the first openly LGBTQ judge in the 
history of the Fourth Circuit, and would break the glass 
ceiling. She also has personal experience when it comes to 
discrimination due to sexual orientation. Ms. Berner 
successfully won a long running case involving her own family 
at the Israeli Supreme Court in a landmark ruling that required 
the government to recognize two mothers as the parent of one 
child.
    In conclusion, I would note that Ms. Berner is a longtime 
resident of Montgomery County, Maryland. She has been an active 
member of her synagogue and community, and lives in Takoma 
Park, Maryland. I appreciate the opportunity to introduce Ms. 
Berner. I was pleased to hear she intends, if confirmed, to 
have her judicial chambers in the Baltimore Federal Courthouse. 
This will allow her to be more fully integrated into the 
diverse and vibrant Maryland legal community.
    Let me close by saying I know the public service is not 
just for the nominee, but for her family. Many of her family 
members are here with us today, and she brings friends from as 
far away as Israel. We welcome them to the room, and thank you 
very much for this attention.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Cardin. Senator Van 
Hollen.

           STATEMENT OF HON. CHRISTOPHER VAN HOLLEN,
           A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MARYLAND

    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member 
Graham, Members of the Judiciary Committee. I'm honored to be 
here with my friend and colleague, Senator Cardin, to introduce 
President Biden's nominee for the Maryland seat on the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Ms. Nicole Berner.
    I'd also like to welcome members of her family: her wife, 
Debra, and their sons, Mattan, Naveh, Segev, and Ari, as well 
as Naveh's fiance, who could not join us in person because we 
couldn't get a sign language interpreter. But to Solimar, I 
would like to [begins to use sign language while speaking] 
welcome you here today. She is watching proudly on C-SPAN. Let 
me just say to the extended family from Israel, we are thrilled 
to have you here today, as well.
    Look, to provide Americans with a fair, just, and equal 
treatment under the law, our judicial system and judges must be 
wholly dedicated to these principles, and for too long, our 
justice system has not represented all of America's voices.
    President Biden has nominated a judge in Nicole Berner who 
understands that the protections and rights of the Constitution 
extend to all people, all Americans. And I'm confident that if 
confirmed, Ms. Berner will serve admirably and faithfully on 
the bench.
    Throughout her career, she has provided outstanding legal 
representation to advance the rights of working families and 
historically underrepresented communities, demonstrating her 
commitment to delivering equal justice for all. Senator Cardin 
has covered many of the highlights in her legal practice. I do 
want to expand on a particular case that he referenced, which 
was Ms. Berner's own case where she had to defend her own 
family.
    At the time, she and her family were living in Israel, and 
Israel did not recognize the non-birth parent in a same-sex 
marriage as a legal parent. Through a multi-year battle, she 
fought for, and eventually won, the right to be recognized for 
what her eldest son, Mattan, already knew to be the truth: She 
was wholly and unequivocally his mom.
    That ruling is considered one of the most important LGBTQ 
rights decisions in Israeli history, expanding the rights of 
families like hers in perpetuity, and representing yet another 
example of Ms. Berner's dedication to supporting all families.
    But it was also an experience that taught Ms. Berner, 
quote, ``How humbling and terrifying it is to be a litigant 
defending the most important thing she has,'' unquote. I know 
that she will bring that experience with her every day to the 
court, understanding that everybody who's coming before the 
Fourth Circuit, if confirmed, believes that their case is the 
most important case in the world.
    Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, I would just like 
to bring to your attention a letter of recommendation signed by 
rabbis from all over the country. The concluding paragraph 
reads as follows: ``Our tradition teaches that the `crown of a 
good name' exceeds all of life's achievements. We believe that 
this appellation is meant to apply to a person of integrity, a 
person who consistently and courageously acts on what they 
believe, a person for whom there is no dissonance between 
outward appearance and action and inner constitution, a person 
of sterling character who is consistently able to discern what 
is right. Nicole is such a person.''
    Members of the Committee, I join Senator Cardin in urging 
her rapid confirmation.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen. Senator 
Menendez.

               STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ,
          A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

    Senator Menendez. Thank you, Chairman Durbin, Ranking 
Member Graham, distinguished Members of the Committee. Today, I 
have the pleasure of joining Senator Booker in introducing an 
exceptionally well-qualified nominee to serve on the United 
States Third Circuit Court of Appeals, Mr. Adeel Mangi of New 
Jersey. I could not be more proud of joining Senator Booker in 
recommending Adeel to President Biden for this important 
vacancy.
    He embodies the highest values of the legal profession. His 
stellar career and lived experiences give me a great confidence 
that he would be a brilliant, fair-minded, and empathetic judge 
on the Third Circuit. And if confirmed, Adeel would make 
history as the first-ever Muslim to serve on our Federal 
appellate courts, a long overdue milestone in our efforts to 
diversify our Federal judiciary. For all these reasons and much 
more, which I'll get to in a moment, Adeel is, without 
question, the right person for the job.
    I want to take a moment to recognize his family members in 
attendance today. He's accompanied by his wife, Sara, his sons, 
Azmir and Zaaran, and his brother, Abeel, who I am sure Adeel 
would say that without their help and support, he would not be 
here today. So, we welcome them, as well.
    Adeel was born and raised in Karachi, a teeming, port city 
of over 20 million people on the southern court of Pakistan. He 
spent the first 18 years of his life in Karachi, where his 
parents instilled in him the value of education and the 
importance of standing out and speaking up.
    Adeel recalls first wanting to become a lawyer after being 
mesmerized by the legendary American legal show, ``Matlock,'' 
which was airing in Karachi. See, we have far-reaching 
influence in the world--and when he was in grade school.
    He attended the storied Karachi Grammar School, where he 
rose to become a champion debater, foretelling a bright future 
as a world-class litigator.
    He then ventured to the United Kingdom, earning his law 
degree from the University of Oxford, and qualifying to become 
a British barrister at law in 1999. Inspired to further his 
legal studies, he decided to immigrate, again, to the United 
States to earn his LL.M. from Harvard Law School in 2000.
    Adeel's global upbringing and education have given him a 
unique perspective on the law and society, and in his own 
telling, has deepened his admiration for the American justice 
system and the rule of law.
    Following his legal education at Harvard, he settled in 
Jersey City, New Jersey, joined the prestigious New York City 
law firm, Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler. He hasn't looked back 
since. Starting as an associate in 2000, he rapidly climbed the 
ranks of Patterson, demonstrating his prowess as a civil 
appellate litigator, becoming a partner in the firm in 2010.
    For the last 23 years at Patterson, Adeel has specialized 
in high stakes, complex commercial litigation across a wide 
range of industries. He has successfully argued cases before a 
number of Federal appeals and trial courts, as well as numerous 
State courts.
    His impressive track record winning cases for clients has 
earned him countless accolades as a premier commercial and 
appellate litigator, exactly the kind of legal experience we 
need on the Third Circuit, which routinely handles some of the 
country's most complex commercial cases.
    For all of these reasons, the Bar Association rated him 
unanimously ``well qualified.'' Throughout his time at 
Patterson, Adeel has never lost sight of the importance of 
giving back--and giving back he has, significantly. He's 
devoted over 4,000 hours to pro bono matters, taking on high-
profile cases, representing vulnerable, often voiceless clients 
against powerful institution and interests.
    His tireless pro bono work has led him to file 8 amicus 
briefs before the United States Supreme Court, more than 13 
briefs before Federal circuit courts across the country, again, 
underscoring his readiness to serve as an appellate judge.
    One case in particular is emblematic of Adeel's dogged 
pursuit of justice for the most marginalized. He represented 
the family of a mentally ill African-American inmate in a New 
York State correctional facility who was killed by prison 
guards. In 2020, after a 2-week trial, he secured a $5 million 
settlement from the jury for the inmate's death, the largest 
settlement in New York State history involving the death of a 
State prison inmate, and a mandate that cameras and microphones 
be installed throughout the correctional facility.
    What I've outlined, in terms of his background alone, would 
be enough to merit his confirmation to the Third Circuit, but 
I'll close on this note. This is one of the most historic 
nominations I have ever had the privilege of participating in 
my 18 years in the Senate. If confirmed, Adeel would become the 
first-ever Muslim to serve on our Federal circuit courts.
    There are just two Muslims currently serving as Article III 
Federal judges. If he is confirmed, I'm proud to know that two 
out of the three Muslim judges on the Federal bench would be 
from New Jersey, both himself and New Jersey District Court 
Judge Zahid Quraishi.
    This is a milestone we should have reached many years ago. 
With nearly three-and-a-half million Muslims in the United 
States, and just over 320,000 Muslims in New Jersey alone, our 
Muslim communities have waited far too long for better 
representation in our democracy. His confirmation would help 
ensure that our most hallowed institutions better reflect the 
rich and diverse tapestry of America.
    In conclusion, I couldn't think of a better nominee for 
this incredibly important seat on the Third Circuit Court of 
Appeals. I am confident you will see here, in the course of 
this hearing, that he is a lawyer's lawyer: brilliant, 
dignified, open-minded, and empathetic. It's exactly why I'm 
sure he will excel as a judge's judge, if confirmed to the 
Third Circuit. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Menendez. Before recognizing 
Senator Booker, I should have mentioned earlier, my colleagues 
have busy schedules as well, and you're certainly welcome to 
stay as long as you wish. But if you would like to step out, 
that would not reflect on your interest to the nominees. 
Senator Booker.
    Senator Booker. Senator, I'd love to defer to the Oregon 
Senators and the Indiana Senator. They may have to go. I'm 
going to be here for the duration, so I'll go after Senator 
Young, if that's okay.
    Chair Durbin. Next is Senator Wyden.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN,
            A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OREGON

    Senator Wyden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the ever-
collegial Senator Booker, as well. And I'm going to be very 
brief because we have a terrific nominee. Senator Merkley and I 
feel very strongly about Amy Baggio, who's been nominated for 
the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon.
    She comes with a background, colleagues, as both a jurist 
and a litigator, and I particularly want to mention her career 
on the bench. She has presided over hundreds of civil and 
criminal matters and handled something in the vicinity of 42 
trials, half of which were jury trials, throughout her career, 
Mr. Chairman and colleagues. And this is a testament to the 
judge's fairness. She has never been asked, colleagues, by any 
party--either the prosecutor or the defense--for a different 
judge. And I think, suffice it to say, that is a testament to 
her approach with respect to fairness and balance.
    Also, in addition to fairness, she's demonstrated an 
ability to make thoughtful decisions that protect our 
communities and protect our values. For example, in one case, 
she sentenced a man to 34 years in prison for disturbing 
crimes, including first degree sexual abuse. This sentence was 
significantly longer than that that was requested by defense 
counsel. Despite an appeal from the defense on multiple issues, 
her decision in that case was ultimately affirmed. This is 
just, in my view, one example of her dedication to the law, to 
fairness, and ensuring that community values are represented in 
her decisions.
    She has a couple of other attributes that I would just say, 
colleagues, are, I think, particularly important. First, I have 
appreciated her long service as a mentor to newer lawyers. 
We're always looking for lawyers to give back. I remember, when 
I ran the Legal Aid Program for senior citizens--I've talked to 
many of you about that over the years--and we were always 
looking for individuals who'd be mentors. Amy Baggio has been 
exactly that, and has been a leader at the Oregon State Bar in 
the Oregon Judicial Department in that regard.
    Also, she spent a number of years volunteering at 
elementary schools, providing support to help individual 
students with reading. Again, this, to me, shows her deep 
background in caring about our community.
    Finally, her ratings, and it's no surprise here are 
unanimous, ``well qualified,'' from the American Bar 
Association, and obviously, her judicial temperament, her 
savvy, her evenhandedness, compassion, and dedication to the 
law is what gave her that rating.
    She was advanced in a special committee that Senator 
Merkley and I have had for a number of years. We've always 
tried to work in a bipartisan way. The chairman, I remember, 
Senator Hatfield, and I started it. Senator Merkley and I 
continue it, and it is that committee that has advanced Judge 
Baggio.
    I urge my colleagues to support her nomination. And in the 
interest of time, and because my thoughtful partner in the 
Oregon delegation will have some important things to say, let 
me yield at that point.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Wyden. Senator Merkley.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF MERKLEY,
            A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OREGON

    Senator Merkley. Thank you, Chair Durbin, Ranking Member 
Graham, Members of the Committee. It's an honor to come and 
assist Senator Wyden in introducing you to Judge Baggio. She's 
unquestionably qualified to serve on the Federal bench. I know 
she'll do an exceptional job because her experience is 
extensive and deep.
    Since 2019, she's been a judge on the Multnomah County 
Circuit Court in Portland, Oregon. Prior to that, she had her 
own law firm, and prior to that, she was in the Office of the 
Federal Public Defender for the District of Oregon, as well as 
the Portland office of the Metropolitan Public Defender.
    When she first went to law school, she anticipated going 
into environmental law. Then a clerkship at the Federal Public 
Defender's Office convinced her of the need to bring her skills 
to represent the indigent and the underserved. There is no 
justice in the justice system if defendants do not have 
competent representation. She engaged not only her clients, but 
their families to achieve results that allowed them to address 
the underlying issues that led them to the criminal justice 
system.
    Since taking the bench in 2019, she's made important 
rulings like protecting basic healthcare rights of incarcerated 
people during COVID-19 pandemic. She's shown her passion for 
protecting the innocent and her impartiality in preserving the 
rule of law. That kind of human understanding is what is 
happening in her courtroom.
    So, along with being a brilliant jurist, it's why she's so 
effective, and it's why she's so respected. And you can't help 
but notice that the same words keep coming up when people 
describe her: kind, conscientious, committed, compassionate, 
qualified, respectful, and respected.
    But I'll add one more word, that is, she's an Oregonian. 
She may have been born in Pennsylvania. She may have gone to 
high school in Alabama. She may have attended college in North 
Carolina. But she came to Oregon to attend Lewis & Clark Law 
School, and made our State her home, and her own. She's a proud 
Oregonian, and Oregonians are proud of her.
    She is so well qualified that I am particularly delighted 
to be here today, on behalf of our State, to support her 
nomination. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Merkley. Senator Young.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. TODD YOUNG,
            A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF INDIANA

    Senator Young. Thank you, Chair Durbin, Ranking Member 
Graham, and Members of the Committee. I have the honor today of 
introducing two fine Hoosier judges who have been nominated to 
serve on the District Court for the Northern District of 
Indiana.
    I don't wish to show favoritism, so I'll go in alphabetical 
order.
    The first, the Honorable Cristal Brisco. She currently 
serves as a judge on the St. Joseph County Superior Court. She 
was appointed to that position by Republican Governor Eric 
Holcomb in 2021.
    She's a lifelong Hoosier, growing up in Gary, attending 
undergrad at Valparaiso, and Law School at Notre Dame. She, her 
husband, and two daughters have remained in the South Bend 
area.
    Judge Gretchen Lund has served as superior court judge in 
Elkhart County since 2015, and has also served as judge in 
Goshen City Court, and a deputy prosecutor in Elkhart County.
    She's also a lifelong Hoosier, having attended Butler 
University and Valparaiso University. She lives in Goshen with 
her husband and daughters.
    I've recommended many fellow Hoosiers to this Committee 
over the years, but until today, I hadn't had the pleasure of 
recommending judges from our State superior courts. The judges 
in our State courts are working incredibly hard every day to 
administer justice in our local communities. I'm struck 
oftentimes by their caseloads, and I suspect, as with our 
Federal court system, they could use some more judges. But they 
plow through it, and do their work diligently and quite 
professionally. So, I'm grateful for each and every one of 
those State court judges.
    But before you today are two of our very best. Judge Lund 
and Judge Brisco have impressed their colleagues and those who 
have come before their courts. If confirmed, they'll be missed 
locally, but I trust they'll bring the same sense of 
professionalism to the Federal bench. Thank you, Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Young. Senator Booker.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CORY A. BOOKER,
          A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

    Senator Booker. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I am 
really excited right now, and for all of my colleagues, like 
Senator Graham, who love New Jersey almost as much as they love 
their own States, this is a very great moment that I have. It's 
just an honor, an immense honor to introduce Adeel Mangi as a 
nominee to serve as a circuit court judge on the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Third Circuit.
    Now, I confess that this introduction may be a little bit 
strained because I am very jealous of this man. Not only did he 
marry such an extraordinary woman that somehow outdoes him in 
stature, prowess, grace, and intelligence, but he also makes me 
jealous because he has two extraordinary boys who are sitting 
there with him right now, and truly, they will outshadow the 
parents in the future.
    But I'm also jealous because he, too, in the 90s, studied 
at the University of Oxford. As one of my friends, knowing the 
both of us, said, I was a bright flashlight at Oxford, but 
Adeel, Adeel was a star.
    And I am grateful that this man, who learned about the 
United States of America and our legal system, fell in love 
with it in Pakistan, made a determination to be a part of it, 
here in the United States of America.
    After studying at the University of Oxford, he made a 
mistake and went to a safety school called Harvard.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. He also served--studied, receiving a full 
academic scholarship available only to the best students in the 
UK. Upon graduation, Mr. Mangi joined the prestigious law 
firm--New York City law firm Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler, 
where he is now a partner.
    In the 20 years in private practice, he has become 
extraordinarily notable, not just for his incredible successes 
as a private lawyer--he's tried multiple cases to verdict, 
judgment, or final decision, served as a party or an amicus 
brief counsel in more than 30 appeals before Federal courts, 
and has counsel on numerous amicus briefs submitted to the 
United States Supreme Court.
    But what he has become known of as, in which many people 
reached out, is because he has become that star for justice, 
and when it comes to religious freedom and religious liberty. 
It's not often that I have people from such diverse 
communities, from Catholic leaders to Sikh leaders, who will 
testify to the important role that he has played, amidst his 
private career, in advancing the cause in our country of 
religious liberty and religious freedom. He has worked on so 
many issues that has made him, in New Jersey, one of our 
preeminent lawyers.
    Indeed, Benchmark Litigation said nationally, he is one of 
the America's Top 100 trial lawyers in the United States, 
making note of his extraordinary work when it comes to 
protecting religious liberty. His accomplishments also extend 
to vindicating the rights of many people who faced the most 
oppressive challenges.
    I am proud that this American is going to the Federal bench 
because I would be terrified if he ran for office against me in 
the 2026 elections.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. So, this is a very self-interested cause of 
mine, is to get him on the Federal bench and out of my life.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. And so, the historic nature, as Senator 
Menendez mentioned, of this nomination, cannot be understated. 
This is a person that is extraordinary in his dedication to 
American ideals and American values, standing up for those who 
often don't have the opportunity to stand up for themselves.
    I am proud that this Jersey boy, straight out of Jersey 
City, a city known for extraordinary immigrants making 
extraordinary contributions to our country, will continue in 
that tradition, and hopefully, get away from the Article I 
branch of Government----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker [continuing]. And be safely secured in the 
Article III. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Booker. And now I'd like 
to ask the two circuit court nominees to approach the witness 
table for questions from Members.
    [Pause.]
    Chair Durbin. If you'll please raise your right hand.
    [Witnesses are sworn in.]
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, very much. Let the record reflect 
both of the nominees answered in the affirmative, which makes 
my job easier. And I think we're going to start with Ms. 
Berner. You each have 5 minutes to speak, and then after that, 
we'll allow my colleagues to have the same option.

   STATEMENT OF NICOLE G. BERNER, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS UNITED 
          STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

    Ms. Berner. Good morning. I want to begin by thanking you, 
Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Graham, and all of the Members 
of this Committee, for holding this hearing. I'm aware you have 
many demands on your time, and I appreciate your making this 
hearing a priority.
    I also want to thank my home State Senators, Senators 
Cardin and Van Hollen, for their support throughout this 
process, and, in particular, for their kind and generous 
introductions today.
    Finally, I want to thank President Biden for the tremendous 
honor of this nomination. This nomination has been the greatest 
honor of my professional life, and for that, I am extremely 
grateful.
    I am fortunate to be joined today by dear family, 
colleagues, and friends, some of whom have traveled a 
tremendous distance to be here.
    I want to begin by introducing my immediate family. Sitting 
behind me are my wife, Debra, who believes in me and supports 
me in everything I do. My three sons, Mattan, Naveh, and Segev, 
and my stepson, Ari. My soon-to-be daughter-in-law, Solimar, is 
home, caring for my new beloved grandson, Ori Mateo.
    Being a mother has been, without a doubt, the most 
important, rewarding, meaningful, and challenging aspect of my 
life. I have always worked hard to model for my children the 
values that were instilled in me by my own parents, and by my 
faith: values of hard work, commitment to education and 
community, to social service, and to the Jewish value of 
``tikkun olam,'' repairing the world.
    My mother, who I lost last year, was born into the Great 
Depression, the first in her family to be born in this 
incredible country, to parents whose families had come to the 
United States from Eastern Europe in search of a better life. 
She grew up watching the horrors of World War II unfold across 
the ocean.
    She believed in our Nation's values of equality and justice 
for all. She and my father, who worked in public service, 
raised me and my siblings with an abiding belief that it was 
each of our responsibility to work to ensure that all people, 
regardless of their background or station in life, were treated 
fairly, justly, and with dignity.
    My sister and my two brothers, who are watching this 
hearing remotely, each in their own way, embody these values. I 
miss my mom every day, and I know she would've been so proud to 
have been here with me.
    Because they knew how much it would've meant to my mother 
to have been here with me, dear members of my extended family, 
Yaffa, Michal, Shani Federman, all traveled here from Israel to 
be with me today. They left their own children and 
grandchildren in the midst of a horrific war to come support 
me. I could not be more grateful to them for making this 
journey.
    Along with these members of my family, I'm also joined in 
the room, and remotely, by many other family members, 
colleagues and friends, mentors and mentees, from throughout my 
life. I appreciate your support and your belief in me.
    Thank you, Senators, for the opportunity to introduce 
myself, and my family, and I welcome the Committee's questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Ms. Berner. I'm going to ask the 
next nominee to please pronounce his last name because I think 
I mispronounced it, and I won't do that again.
    Mr. Mangi. Chair Durbin, it's Mangi. Adeel Mangi.
    Chair Durbin. Mangi?
    Mr. Mangi. Yes, sir.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you very much. Mr. Mangi, the floor is 
yours.
    Mr. Mangi. Thank you.

 STATEMENT OF ADEEL ABDULLAH MANGI, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS UNITED 
           STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

    Mr. Mangi. Chair Durbin, Ranking Member Graham, and 
distinguished Members of the Committee, it's been an honor to 
hear the introductions of my fellow nominees. I regret I cannot 
claim to being a lifelong Hoosier, but I appreciate the 
opportunity to tell you a little bit about myself.
    In 1995, late one night, I set out from my home in Karachi. 
I was headed for the airport bound for England to study law. I 
didn't know what the future held for me. I was 18 years old, 
but I could never have imagined that the path I was setting out 
upon would one day lead me here.
    I came to America in 1999 as a 22-year-old on a 
scholarship. And after completing my studies over the next 23 
years, I had the privilege of litigating across 24 States in 
courts, both trial and appellate, State and Federal. I did that 
first on a student visa work authorization, and then 
ultimately, many years later, with immense pride, as an 
American citizen.
    It is an extraordinary honor to now be considered for this 
opportunity to serve my country. And I am so grateful to 
President Biden for this nomination, and to Senators Booker and 
Menendez, for their very kind introductions and their support.
    May I introduce my family? Here with me is my wife, Sara 
Zaidi, over my left shoulder. Sara is a child therapist. She 
helps children every day, including survivors, with her almost 
magical powers of healing. My life has been filled with many 
changes, but one constant, since I was 16 years old, is that 
everything has revolved around Sara. Also here are our two 
boys, Azmir, who is 13, and Zaaran, who is 12. I hope you like 
the knots on their ties. I tied them myself this morning.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Mangi. They are my closest advisors. They are also 
proud members of the North Jersey Youth Cricket Academy, and 
they'll be available after the hearing, if any of you would 
like tips on your cricket game.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Mangi. Also here with me is my brother, Abeel. I'm told 
rhyming names were a thing in the 70s. He's a cardiothoracic 
surgeon in Connecticut. I'm very grateful for his support and 
guidance throughout my life. And while they cannot be here 
today, may I also recognize the support of my sister, Naveen, 
who runs a charity devoted to the uplift of the rural poor in 
Pakistan, and my parents, Abdullah Mangi, my father, and Anwar 
Mangi, my mother, who has now passed away.
    My parents showered us with love growing up, and instilled 
in us a dedication to the pursuit of education, and that is 
what ultimately has delivered me here today. I'd also like to 
thank my many colleagues and dear friends at my law firm, 
Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler, who took a chance on an LL.M. 
student from Pakistan a very long time ago. With me here today 
is Bill Cavanaugh, who is one of my mentors from Patterson 
Belknap, from whom I've learned much about being a lawyer, 
being a father, and being a human being.
    And finally, also here with me today are two of my very 
dear and old friends, Mohammad Ali Syed and Christopher 
Winters, and I'm very grateful for their support, as well. 
Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you very much, Mr. Mangi. As I read the 
backgrounds of both of the nominees, I was struck by 
similarities and contrasts. Similarities in terms of your legal 
careers, and what you've set out to do, sometimes facing great 
controversy in the process. And contrasts, in terms of where 
you came from, and how you happen to be sitting at that table 
next to one another at this moment in history.
    It reminded me of two famous Americans whose lives were 
separated by 200 years of history. The first, John Adams, who 
in 1770, stepped up and risked his life, and his legal career, 
and his political career for that matter, to defend British 
soldiers after the deadly riot in Boston.
    And then I thought, as well as, of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a 
known advocate, came before this Senate asking to be appointed 
to the Supreme Court. At the end of the day, she never backed 
down on any of her beliefs, and made it clear what her values 
would be if she was on the Court, and was clear enough to this 
Committee that the final vote was 96-to-3.
    I wish you the same good luck----
    [Laughter.]
    Chair Durbin [continuing]. But just to make the point that 
this Committee saw a person who was convinced of her own 
values, and didn't shrink from that conviction, and still 
believed she could be a good and fair jurist, which she proved 
to be.
    So, let's start at the beginning. Ms. Berner, you've been a 
passionate advocate and an effective advocate for many 
controversial issues. Will you carry that with you to the bench 
when you're faced with different laws and different facts that 
may draw a different conclusion?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, good morning, and thank you for that 
question and the opportunity to respond. I have, during the 
course of my career, zealously advocated on behalf of millions 
of working men and women, and I've been proud of that work. I 
understand that the role of a judge is a very different role 
than the role of an advocate.
    I began my legal career as a law clerk to two esteemed 
jurists, and I served both on the Federal court of appeals and 
on the Federal district court. And I saw firsthand the 
importance of approaching every case with an open mind, of 
studying the record and the case deeply and thoroughly, of 
understanding the relevant and binding precedent, and to fairly 
applying the precedent to the law without regard to prior 
representation, or personal opinions, on any issue. And that 
would be my commitment, were I so fortunate as to be confirmed.
    Chair Durbin. Mr. Mangi, you've represented some 
controversial clients in the past. And the obvious question is, 
are you sharing their views on things, or do you feel some 
obligation as an attorney that there be representation in 
court?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I believe it's critical, and the 
foundation of our legal system, that attorneys must effectively 
advocate for their clients, regardless of whether they agree 
with them or not.
    Chair Durbin. And faced with a challenging situation of 
conscience on the court when it comes down to different laws 
and different facts, what is your disposition?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, my approach is always to study with an 
open mind and dispassionately, the law and the facts, and do my 
very best to come to a fair and just adjudication.
    Chair Durbin. And if it's a struggle with your conscience 
as to your own personal views, what's going to decide the case?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I believe it is fundamentally important 
that litigants in the Federal justice system be able to receive 
consistent adjudication from judges, regardless of that judge's 
personal beliefs or background. So, I set aside my personal 
views, my background, my beliefs. I am looking to apply the law 
in a fair and even-handed way, consistent with my colleagues on 
the bench, if I'm so lucky to be confirmed.
    Chair Durbin. In your legal career, have you appeared 
before a judge or worked with a judge that became kind of your 
North Star in terms of what you would aspire to be as a judge?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, there are many judges for whom I have 
great admiration. One of them in the District of New Jersey, I 
won't name, but I will say what I've been so impressed by, 
throughout, by many appearances, is that this judge always 
appears on the bench with immaculate preparation, of thorough 
knowledge of the law and the facts on the cases before them, 
conducts themselves with absolute dignity and respect for all 
of the parties in front of them, and then writes opinions that 
are intellectually honest, direct, confront all the issues in 
the case, easy or hard, such that whether you win or lose, you 
feel you have been fairly heard and fairly adjudicated.
    Chair Durbin. Ms. Berner, same question.
    Ms. Berner. Thank you, Senator. I have been fortunate to 
be--come before and work for tremendous jurists throughout my 
life. I have been thinking a great deal over the last week, as 
I know many of us have, of the first woman Justice on our 
Supreme Court.
    I remember so well her confirmation. I was a high school 
student. And when Sandra Day O'Connor was appointed, I saw that 
and I thought, as a woman, I can do anything.
    And she forged her own path, she broke glass ceilings, she 
maintained dignity, and treated all fairly. And I know we are 
all thinking of her today, and I would like to bring her name 
into this room, as well.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Ms. Berner. Senator Graham.
    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and 
congratulations to both of you. Ms. Berner, is that right? Got 
your name right there?
    Ms. Berner. Yes, sir.
    Senator Graham. I understand you're a general counsel for 
SEIU, one of the largest unions in the country. I understand 
representing interests that I have made disagreement with, is 
not disqualifying by any means, and advocating positions I may 
disagree with falls in that category, as far as I'm concerned. 
In terms of things you have advocated for, have you advocated 
for collective bargaining rights for prisoners?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I have not.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Have you advocated that 40 percent of 
all large corporate boards be designated for worker 
representatives?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, personally, I have not come across 
that issue.
    Senator Graham. So, the positions that I'm talking about, 
you're not aware of?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, the Service Employees International 
Union represents two million working Americans in every State 
in the country. The union takes positions on a broad range of 
issues. I've served as counsel to the union and represented the 
union.
    Senator Graham. Are you familiar with a working group at 
Harvard called, Clean Slate for Worker Power: Building a Just 
Economy and Democracy?
    Ms. Berner. Yes, I am, Senator.
    Senator Graham. Were you part of that group?
    Ms. Berner. I was invited to participate in several 
meetings of that group, yes.
    Senator Graham. Are you familiar with the product that they 
created?
    Ms. Berner. I am, Senator.
    Senator Graham. Are you familiar that they advocated labor 
rights for prisoners?
    Ms. Berner. I know that that report is quite voluminous 
and----
    Senator Graham. Well, I mean, it's a simple question. 
That's one of the--do you understand they recommended 40 
percent of the corporate board seats be controlled about 
workers?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I participated in several meetings of 
that group. I did not----
    Senator Graham. That doesn't jump out at you? Okay. Have 
you ever said something to the effect that--excuse me, ``At its 
core, the right-to-work movement is deeply racist''?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I believe that in a number of speeches 
that I gave in my capacity as general counsel of SEIU, I spoke 
about----
    Senator Graham. Well, I mean, did you say that?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I believe I spoke about the historic--
--
    Senator Graham. Oh, that's not--I'm asking, did you say, 
``At its core, the right-to-work movement is deeply racist''? 
Because my State is a right-to-work State, an you're going to 
be on the Fourth Circuit.
    Ms. Berner. I spoke about the historic roots----
    Senator Graham. Can you tell me----
    Ms. Berner [continuing]. Of the right-to-work----
    Senator Graham [continuing]. Yes or no, that you said this? 
I mean, you either said it or you didn't.
    Ms. Berner. The speech that you were referencing was a 
speech----
    Senator Graham. Never mind, never mind.
    Mr. Mangi, are you familiar with the Center for Security, 
Race and Rights at Rutgers Law School?
    Mr. Mangi. I am, Senator.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Were you on that board?
    Mr. Mangi. I was on an advisory board----
    Senator Graham. From 19--yes, advisory board from 2019 to 
2023?
    Mr. Mangi. Yes, sir.
    Senator Graham. Are you familiar with a symposium on the 
``20 Years Since 9/11, Whose Narrative? The Exceptionalism of 
9/11,''--it's a panel talking about 9/11, 20 years later?
    Mr. Mangi. I'm not familiar with that, Senator. No.
    Senator Graham. Okay. You don't know anything about it?
    Mr. Mangi. No, Senator. I was on an advisory board, which 
met once a year, and its goal was to talk about what areas of 
academic focus would be useful for the----
    Senator Graham. So, you're not aware that the board that 
you're advising was one of the co-sponsors, ``Whose Narrative? 
20 Years Later,'' that had panelists, including someone who was 
convicted for providing support to Islamic Jihad?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I've never heard of that event and I 
don't know anything about it. This was not a board of 
directors. This was an advisory board.
    Senator Graham. No, I'm just trying to figure out the board 
you're advising [holds up a document]. They had three people. 
One was convicted conspiring to support Islamic Jihad terrorist 
group. The other supports a group that featured the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and Leila Khaled was the 
speaker. The other panelist, Mr. Bazian, was the co-founder of 
Students for Justice in Palestine, who has publicly called for 
an intifada in the United States. You don't know anything about 
this?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I don't know any of those people. I 
don't know anything about that event.
    Senator Graham. Does it seem like this is representative of 
the positions of the institute we're talking about? Are you 
shocked to find out they would do this? Now I want to introduce 
into the record the panelists----
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, this would----
    Senator Graham. I don't want to belabor it.
    Mr. Mangi. Sure.
    Senator Graham. Would you condemn this symposium and the 
people that were on it?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I have----
    Senator Graham. Because a Jewish member of the New Jersey 
delegation--what's his name? Josh Gottheimer was very upset, 
and he said it was--and the Anti-Defamation League condemned 
the whole symposium. Would you condemn it?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I don't know any of these people or 
that event. I certainly and unequivocally----
    Senator Graham. Okay.
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. Would condemn any terrorism or any 
people associated with it.
    Senator Graham. Thank you. I'd like to introduce this in 
the record. Thank you very much.
    Chair Durbin. Without objection.
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Chair Durbin. Senator Whitehouse.
    Senator Whitehouse. Thank you very much. Welcome to both of 
you. I'm delighted to see you here. Ms. Berner, you are a 
member of the American Law Institute, as I understand it?
    Ms. Berner. Yes, I am, Senator.
    Senator Whitehouse. Could you explain how one gets on that? 
Could I sign up?
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Berner. My understanding is that the members of the 
American Law Institute are recommended anonymously by current 
members of the institute, and they are----
    Senator Whitehouse. On the basis of what?
    Ms. Berner. On the basis of their respect in the community, 
of their legal prowess, of their practice of law.
    Senator Whitehouse. It's considered a professional 
accolade?
    Ms. Berner. That is my understanding, yes.
    Senator Whitehouse. How many people have enjoyed being so 
recognized, or currently part of the American Law Institute?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, sitting here today, I don't recall the 
exact number. I do believe the number is capped, however.
    Senator Whitehouse. There's a terrific person in Rhode 
Island who followed me as United States attorney and did a 
pretty fabulous job, and is extremely, extremely bright and 
able. And she's the only person I'm aware of, in Rhode Island, 
who's a member of the American Law Institute. So, you're in 
pretty heady company there, and I congratulate you on that. I 
think it's a very significant recognition by your colleagues of 
your ability and capability as a lawyer at the very highest 
levels of legal practice. So, congratulations.
    Ms. Berner. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Whitehouse. Mr. Mangi, you are at Patterson 
Belknap, which is quite a big, powerful, and competent law 
firm. Are you not?
    Mr. Mangi. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Whitehouse. And you have done considerable pro bono 
work for that firm?
    Mr. Mangi. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Whitehouse. Does the firm let anybody go running 
off and do pro bono work, or do they have a process for making 
sure that the pro bono work that comes out of the firm is high 
quality?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, Patterson Belknap has a storied history 
of pro bono work. And work is organized through a pro bono 
committee such that all work has the approval of the firm 
before any pro bono projects are taken on.
    Senator Whitehouse. So, the firm takes a pretty significant 
degree of pride in its pro bono work?
    Mr. Mangi. Absolutely, Senator. Patterson, in some years, 
has been ranked number 1 in the country for pro bono 
commitment. We're very proud of that.
    Senator Whitehouse. And can anyone in the firm jump up and 
do a pro bono case, or do they need to go and get the approval 
of the members of the firm who've been assigned to police the 
quality of the pro bono work?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, cases are all approved through a pro 
bono committee, but the firm has had 100 percent participation 
for many, many years.
    Senator Whitehouse. And how many times have you been 
selected to serve as pro bono counsel by the firm?
    Mr. Mangi. I don't have a count, Senator. I've done many, 
many pro bono cases. I've done pro bono work every year since I 
started at the firm in 2000.
    Senator Whitehouse. I would like to ask both of you the 
same question. You are headed for appellate courts. We have a 
Supreme Court, just to put the pin on the issue, that has taken 
up fact finding as an activity.
    In my view, fact finding belongs at the district court 
level, and very often when facts are found and an appellate 
court believes that they have been found erroneously, that, in 
fact, clear error has been committed, the solution to that 
problem is to refer it back to the district court for further 
proceedings. What is your view of the role of an appellate 
court in original fact finding?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, thank you for the question. The role 
of Federal appellate judges is a limited one. The role of the 
judge is to review the record that has been created in the 
lower court to carefully research the law and to apply the 
facts to the law in----
    Senator Whitehouse. Sua sponte fact finding is, or is not, 
a part of that responsibility?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, it is my belief that that would not be 
appropriate for a court of appeals judge to find facts. The 
role of the judge is to review the facts as they have been 
developed by the lower court, and to review any findings of 
fact under very deferential, clear error standard.
    Senator Whitehouse. Mr. Mangi, 4 seconds.
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, having tried many cases, the factual 
mosaic in the trial court is incredibly rich. And it is only in 
the trial court that you can set forth that level of detail.
    Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Chairman. Wish you both 
well.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Lee.
    Senator Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks, to both of 
you, for being here.
    Ms. Berner, I'd like to start with you, if that's okay. In 
March of 2020, would've been just before the COVID pandemic 
changed all sorts of things that year, you spoke at Rutgers, at 
an event on economic justice. As part of your speech, you 
criticized the Republicans on this Committee, comparing us to 
union busters.
    Now, you stated as follows, and I quote, ``Despite the fact 
that multiple women credibly accused Kavanaugh of having 
sexually assaulted them, Senate Republicans allowed only one 
woman to come forward to testify. They ignored or belittled the 
other accusers. The fact that Dr. Ford was the only--was only 
one person, allowed Republicans to pretend the situation was 
`he said, she said,' and these techniques were taken directly 
from the playbook of anti-union employers during union 
organizing campaigns.''
    Now, I assume that you would've thought it would be more 
fair to the parties to have a panel of any person inclined to 
throw accusations at then-judge, now Justice Kavanaugh. Is that 
correct? Is that what you were saying?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, good morning. Thank you for your 
question. When I made that speech, I was speaking at Rutgers 
University in my capacity as general counsel of the Service 
Employees International Union----
    Senator Lee. Right. But it was you speaking. Right?
    Ms. Berner. Yes, sir.
    Senator Lee. Yes. So, is--in response to my question, is 
that what you're saying? It would've been more fair to just put 
anybody up there willing to throw accusations at him?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I believe it falls to the Members of 
this Committee to decide and determine how judicial 
confirmation hearings take place. What I can tell you is that I 
believe Justice Kavanaugh, as every other Justice of the 
Supreme Court, was legitimately confirmed. And were I to be so 
fortunate as to be confirmed, I would follow his opinions and 
the opinions of every Justice.
    Senator Lee. Okay. I do take issue with your suggestion 
that we ignored or belittled anyone. I sit on this Committee. I 
sat on this Committee then. We went to great lengths to make 
sure that we heard accusations. Now, would you consider a 
person's involvement in a system of covered-up sexual 
harassment something that should be disclosed in a nominations 
hearing?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, the system for disclosure is quite 
lengthy. I know my colleague and I participated in lengthy 
reviews of our records and background investigations, and I 
trust the Members of this Committee to determine the 
appropriate process for review of nominees.
    Senator Lee. Now, your actions dealing with an SEIU sexual 
harassment scandal were outlined in an expose published by the 
Payday Report, a pro-labor website in 2019. Whether or not you 
believe numerous women who accused the SEIU executives of 
sexual harassment, do you think it would've been important for 
you to disclose to this Committee your involvement in that 
scandal?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I was general counsel. I was counsel 
to the Service Employees International Union at the time of the 
events that you are referencing. And as a lawyer for my client, 
I zealously advocated for my client in those matters, as in 
every other matter.
    Senator Lee. Sure. Now, one of the women who was alleging 
to have been the victim of misconduct--misconduct, sexual 
misconduct by some--several of the men in leadership roles, in 
roles of significant authority within SEIU, including her SEIU-
UHW division director, who wrote a letter to which you 
responded.
    Now, in that letter, she begged you to come to a sworn 
deposition where she would be testifying. She would be 
providing sworn testimony about the alleged assaults against 
her by SEIU directors and executives, so that you could reach 
your own conclusion as to whether there were problems within 
the union.
    Now, you responded, declining to attend or even investigate 
the matter, writing as follows, quote, ``Because each local 
SEIU employs its own staff and sets its own personnel policies 
and protocols, the international union does not have a direct 
role in investigating allegations or concerns that may arise in 
local unions regarding personnel matters.'' You also encouraged 
her to continue engaging with local staff, primarily what that 
meant was continuing to engage with the person she was 
accusing, with the guy she had accused of victimizing her.
    So, why didn't you disclose your involvement in this issue, 
including, and especially, that part. I mean, that--that's not 
a realistic option, is it? To tell the victim, go talk to the 
person who's messing with you, who's harassing you, who's 
breaking the law? You didn't disclose that to the Committee. 
Did you?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I faithfully complied with all of the 
requests asked of me and required of me of disclosures. In my 
25 years of practice of law, I have handled hundreds of 
matters, and I have done so zealously, as has been my 
professional obligation as an advocate.
    And I understand that, sitting before you today, I am 
seeking a position as a neutral, and I would take the 
transition to that new position seriously and faithfully. And 
any position that I had taken in the past on behalf of a client 
would not influence any decision that I would make, were I so 
fortunate as to be confirmed.
    Senator Lee. Dave Regan, who's still the president of that 
union, is still a vice president--he was one of the men most 
often accused. And he was allowed to use the union members' 
dues to defend himself. Do you think that was an appropriate 
use of the members' dues?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I am not counsel to the local union 
that you are referring to, and I'm not familiar with the facts 
that you referenced.
    Senator Lee. I see my time's expired. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Lee. Senator Booker.
    Senator Booker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Before I get into matters of the law, Mr. Mangi, you 
clearly had a more distinguished academic career at Oxford than 
I did. But I was a starting member of the Oxford national 
championship basketball team. Do you have any rivalry in my 
athletic prowess?
    Mr. Mangi. I do, Senator Booker.
    Senator Booker. You do?
    Mr. Mangi. I played cricket and field hockey which, let me 
say, is not only for women. It is also a men's game, in many 
parts of the world. And I got the Roger Bannister Scholarship 
for Academics and Sports.
    Senator Booker. Sir, I'm excited to support your 
nomination, but I just want to say for the record, I don't like 
you.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. You represent--you have sat on advisory 
boards, and boards of lots of organizations. I just want to 
know, do you support all the views of organizations you've sat 
on the board of?
    Mr. Mangi. Certainly not.
    Senator Booker. And yet, why, why would you continue to 
stay on a board if that organization doesn't fit fully within 
your beliefs?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I think it's critically important to 
have open discussion about difficult issues, and where my views 
differ from people, and they often do, to express my views in 
the hopes that I can convince people, and draw them to my side 
of a debate or a position.
    Senator Booker. I've supported the ACLU in the past, and 
I've battled with the ACLU when I was a mayor. Does it make any 
sense whatsoever, on organizations that fight for rights and 
freedoms, if you are supportive of those organizations, or even 
financially supportive of those organizations, is it--should we 
conclude that that every piece of litigation that they have 
brought up is, could be associated with your beliefs?
    Mr. Mangi. Certainly not.
    Senator Booker. And your clients, your pro bono clients, I 
know for example, one that I've read quite a bit about, that 
Pastor Ramsay-Nobles has written extensively about you being a 
person of integrity, an extraordinary lawyer: ``His team's 
spent 5 years''--your team, she's saying, ``has spent 5 years 
investigating her brother's--his death.'' You won a big 
settlement for him, I think the biggest in the State's history 
in New York. Is that correct?
    Mr. Mangi. For his family, Senator. That's correct.
    Senator Booker. For his family, because he was killed----
    Mr. Mangi. Yes, sir.
    Senator Booker [continuing]. While in prison. Do you know 
he was in prison for some pretty heinous crimes?
    Mr. Mangi. I do.
    Senator Booker. And yet, you represented him in his 
wrongful death?
    Mr. Mangi. I did.
    Senator Booker. Can I make any assumption about what your 
views are on the heinous, awful crimes that he committed?
    Mr. Mangi. Certainly not. That case, Senator, our 
allegations were that the individual in question was restrained 
after a fight, handcuffed behind his back, surrounded by 
officers, and then walked off a mental health ward. And he had 
very serious mental health issues. He suffered from paranoid 
schizophrenia.
    And after being fully restrained, handcuffed, and walked 
off on his own power, he arrived at the end of that walk dead, 
or close to dead. And the evidence--forensic evidence suggested 
that he had been choked and beaten, resulting in his death.
    So, the principle that we were looking to litigate in that 
case is that no one, regardless of their background, deserves 
that, and their crime is irrelevant to that equation.
    Senator Booker. I just found it curious when, years ago, 
when I was starting to look into your record, that humbled me 
considerably. That you just have made a lot of effort to 
represent people, the causes of various faiths, from denials of 
mosques, Catholic charities, Sikh Americans, many different 
faiths, many different denominations, almost as if you were 
making this a specialty within your work. Why is such cross-
religious work so important to you?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I'm a person of faith. But one of the 
things that--and remember, I wasn't born American. I chose to 
become American, and I chose to make my life here and raise my 
family here. And one of the things I was so struck by is the 
tapestry, and the mosaic of America, and all these people with 
all these different religious backgrounds can come together and 
live in harmony toward common goals.
    And so, I thought it's important that people of faith have 
a voice on many of the critical issues that are before the 
Supreme Court and the appellate courts. And I thought there's 
something beautiful about so many faiths being able to come 
together. Sometimes in some cases, more than 150 different 
religious groups coming together to present a common position 
to the Supreme Court of the United States.
    Senator Booker. Thank you very much. And I'll just say in 
final conclusion, I made certain that my mother did not watch 
this hearing because she would've asked me, why didn't I 
achieve more in my academic career? So--thank you very much, 
Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. It's a question on the mind of many of your 
colleagues, too.
    [Laughter.]
    Chair Durbin. Senator Cotton.
    Senator Cotton. Ms. Berner, I want to pick up where Senator 
Graham left off. He read you a quote of yours, where you say, 
``At its core, the right-to-work movement is deeply racist.'' 
He asked you several times a simple yes-or-no statement, ``Is 
that what you said?'' And you refused to answer. So, I'd like 
to ask you again, did you say that ``the right-to-work movement 
is deeply racist''?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, good morning. Thank you for allowing 
me to answer the question. In the speech I was giving, I was 
speaking about a historic----
    Senator Cotton. Okay, so this is what you did with Senator 
Graham. It is a simple yes-or-no question. I'm not asking you 
about the context of it. I'm not asking where you did it. I'm 
not asking what you were wearing that day. I'm saying, did you 
say that the right-to-work movement is deeply racist? Yes or 
no?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, the speech I was giving, was it about 
a historic----
    Senator Cotton. Look, you're not coming off very well. 
You've been overcoached on this question. You knew that it was 
going to be raised. It is a simple yes-or-no question. By 
refusing to answer, I guess you're telling everyone up here 
that you're--the answer is yes, you just don't want to admit 
that. You don't want it to be on tape in this hearing.
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I believe that individuals, who today 
support the right-to-work laws, are not racist.
    Senator Cotton. So, did you say the right-to-work movement 
is deeply racist?
    Ms. Berner. I was speaking about the history--the original 
history of that movement.
    Senator Cotton. Yes or no? Did you say the right-to-work 
movement is deeply racist?
    Ms. Berner. Historically, the roots of the----
    Senator Cotton. Yes or no. Did you say that line?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I don't have my--the line of my speech 
in front of me. There were many lines in that speech.
    Senator Cotton. Okay. Are people in Wisconsin deeply 
racist? They have--they're a right-to-work State.
    Ms. Berner. Senator, as I mentioned----
    Senator Cotton. Many Wisconsinites failed in the Civil War 
to free slaves. Are the people of Wisconsin deeply racist?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I do not believe that it can be said 
of the people of a State that they are racist. No.
    Senator Cotton. Is the right-to-work law in Wisconsin 
deeply racist?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I'm not aware of the history of the 
specific laws in that State.
    Senator Cotton. Okay. Mr. Mangi, same question--or, I want 
to return, I should say, to Senator Graham. He asked you about 
your affiliation as a member of the advisory board for the 
Center of Security, Race and Rights at Rutgers Law School. It 
didn't pin down when you left that position.
    Mr. Mangi. Senator----
    Senator Cotton. Said 2023, or he said, and you agreed. When 
exactly did you leave that position?
    Mr. Mangi. I believe I communicated it to the director in 
about June, perhaps May.
    Senator Cotton. Okay. Why did you, after so many years of 
being affiliated with them, why did you leave in May or June?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I had views on certain academic areas 
that I thought the center should focus on. And my notion was 
that the center should be producing high-quality academic 
research regarding anti-Muslim bigotry that could then be used 
in civil rights litigation.
    Senator Cotton. Okay.
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. The Center--please.
    Senator Cotton [continuing]. Got it. Thank you.
    Senator Graham also pointed out some of the troubling 
events that the center has hosted, in fact, hosting, that 
someone convicted of support for terrorism, just 3 days after 
Hamas' brutal atrocity against Jews in Israel, they hosted a 
talk at Rutgers about practicing resistance in Palestine. It 
opened by saying, quote, ``It's impossible to give this talk 
without centering and reminding us how settler colonialism, and 
in this case, particular Zionist settler colonialism, is a 
structure that is the provocation,'' end quote.
    Now, I agree with Senator Booker's points. You can't have 
attributed to you every single event or statement or conference 
at where you sat as member of an advisory board, or have in the 
past. So, I just want to give you a chance to respond directly 
to that statement. Do you believe that Zionist settler 
colonialism was a provocation that justified Hamas' atrocity 
against Jews in Israel?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, thank you for an opportunity to address 
that. Let me be very direct and unequivocal on this issue 
because it's a vitally important issue. The events of October 
7th were horrific. A horror. The attacks on civilians were 
abominable and against everything that I stand for. So----
    Senator Cotton. Okay.
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. I have--I have no patience for any 
attempts to justify or defend----
    Senator Cotton. Thank you.
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. Those attacks on civilians.
    Senator Cotton. Do you believe that Jews are colonial 
settlers in Israel?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I have the utmost respect for Jewish 
Americans who I have worked with deeply, who have----
    Senator Cotton. I wasn't asking about----
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. Lifted me up----
    Senator Cotton [continuing]. Jewish Americans. I asked 
about Jews living in Israel. Do you believe they're colonial 
settlers, Jews in Israel?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, the conflict in Israel is--raises 
issues of policy. I'm not from----
    Senator Cotton. Mr. Mangi, this is--this is getting back to 
what I was saying with Ms. Berner. This is a simple yes-or-no 
question. Are Jews in Israel colonial settlers?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I don't feel qualified to opine on that 
because----
    Senator Cotton. Okay.
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. It's not a region whose history 
I've studied----
    Senator Cotton. Okay.
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. Or where I'm from.
    Senator Cotton. Ms. Berner, one final question, kind of 
related. You signed an amicus brief in the Masterpiece Cakeshop 
case, also known as, the ``Bake the cake, bigot'' case, in 
which a man in Colorado, who had a bake shop, didn't want to 
bake a cake for a gay marriage. The Supreme Court ruled in his 
favor.
    Let me ask you, if pro-Hamas radicals went into a cake 
shop, say, a Jewish bakery, and said, ``we want a cake, on it 
that says, `Palestine will be free from the river to the 
sea','' and it had a dagger drawn through the Star of David, 
would that Jewish baker be compelled to bake that cake, under 
your view of the law?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, the Supreme Court ruled in the 
Masterpiece Cakeshop case that the baker's right to freedom of 
religion was--gave that baker the right to deny----
    Senator Cotton. To be exact, they ruled that the Colorado 
Commission had not applied the law neutrally. They later ruled 
in the 303 Creative case that a website designer had that 
right.
    But I'm asking you specifically about a cake baker, same 
thing, in which you said, he did not have that right. Would a 
Jewish baker be compelled to make a cake that says, ``Palestine 
will be free from the river to the sea,'' with a dagger through 
the Star of David?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, the Supreme Court, in the Bostock 
case, did not rule along the lines of--in the Masterpiece case, 
did not rule along the lines that was advocated by my client. 
The brief that you are referencing was a brief that I submitted 
on behalf of my client.
    And, were I be so fortunate to be confirmed, I would, of 
course, apply that Supreme Court precedent, like every other 
Supreme Court precedent or Fourth Circuit precedent, that was 
relevant to the facts that came before me.
    Senator Cotton. Well, I guess, if you're confirmed, we'll 
have to see if pro-Hamas radicals want such a cake baked.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Klobuchar.
    Senator Klobuchar. I actually think Senator Butler was here 
before me, so----
    Chair Durbin. Is that right?
    Senator Klobuchar. Yes, I'm just being nice. Is that 
correct?
    Chair Durbin. I'm sorry.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay.
    Chair Durbin. I'm sorry.
    Senator Butler. When the newest Senator----
    Chair Durbin. Your niceness is rewarded, Senator Butler.
    Senator Butler. You know. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
    Good morning, and congratulations to both of you.
    Ms. Berner, you've been asked twice about a speech that you 
gave, and I think it worth allowing you to actually respond to 
the question.
    Ms. Berner. Thank you, Senator Butler, for the opportunity 
to respond. In the speech that I gave at Rutgers University, I 
was speaking about the historic underpinnings of the original 
right-to-work laws in the early part--in the 1940s, which were 
begun in Southern States. And the initial proponents of those 
laws proposed them, and argued, too, that white workers should 
not be compelled to be in the same organization as Black 
workers. And that was what I was speaking about at Rutgers, at 
that speech.
    Senator Butler. Thank you for providing that context and 
complete answer. There was also a question that was directed to 
you relative to actions in a case at a local union. Can you 
describe the role of local union legal staff in comparison to 
the role that you had as general counsel for the national SEIU?
    Ms. Berner. Thank you. The Service Employees International 
Union represents 2 million workers across every State in this 
country, and Puerto Rico, and Canada as well. And each member 
of the union is a member of a locally chartered affiliate 
union. Each local union has its own counsel, and its own 
constitution, and governing body.
    I am general counsel of the international union, and in 
that capacity, I do not provide--I am not responsible for, nor 
do I advocate on behalf of, local unions, except when I'm 
called upon to do so in specific instances. The specific 
instances that were referenced were not instances that I was 
personally counsel to. To the contrary, I was counsel to the 
international union at that time.
    Senator Butler. Thank you so much.
    Mr. Mangi, it is astonishing to me that, in addition to 
your athletic prowess----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Butler [continuing]. That you have been able to 
dedicate so many hours to your pro bono work. I'd be curious, 
beyond your sports competitions with my colleague, if you could 
share with me and the Committee, if there's any cases that may 
stand out for you in those pro bono hours.
    It is more than a sacrifice of time. You are then choosing 
to not spend time with your lovely children and wife. And so, 
I'd love to hear, and for the Committee to hear, just to get a 
sense of the dedication that you have given to your community.
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, the only sacrifice involved was from my 
partners who enabled me to spend so much time that I could have 
been billing on these matters.
    But I'd like to tell you about the Islamic Society of 
Basking Ridge in New Jersey. You know, this was a small group 
of local Muslims who had been in town for a very long time. And 
they're in a town that's filled with houses of worship, but 
they had no place to pray of their own. They had to carry 
prayer rugs to a community center, set up every week, break 
down, and do that for many years.
    And when they wanted to set up their own mosque, they were 
met with an explosion of hatred and bigotry, and they were put 
through 4 years and 39 hearings before a local planning board, 
with every kind of picayune and Kafkaesque objection--to the 
height of a fence, or the depth of a tree line--that you can 
imagine.
    And the same people who were cross-examining them about 
those issues in the planning board were outside of the planning 
board talking about their true reasons for opposing, all of 
which had to do with Islam and Muslims.
    So, it was a great honor to represent that group, and it 
was the courage of the people that are part of that. Mohammad 
Ali Chaudry was the president of that group, and they said, 
``Look, this is America. We're going to stand up for our rights 
in the courts, and we're going to win.'' And they did. And it 
was a display of what courage in the legal system can get for 
you.
    Senator Butler. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Senator Booker. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to invoke Rule XIX. 
The junior Senator from California does not know that she 
cannot insult the honor of her colleagues directly. And to 
presume that my athletic prowess was not equal to Mr. Mangi's 
is a direct assault on my honor.
    [Laughter.]
    Chair Durbin. Thank you for defending yourself--again.
    [Laughter.]
    Chair Durbin. Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Kennedy. Ms. Berner, you didn't tell Senator Graham 
the truth. Did you?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I took an oath to tell the truth, and 
I have done so faithfully.
    Senator Kennedy. Now, on February 22nd, 2018, you spoke to 
the American Constitution Society, and this is what you said: 
``The right-to-work movement is deeply racist.'' You said that. 
Didn't you?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I do not have that speech in front of 
me. I have spoken on a number of occasions----
    Senator Kennedy. You turned your----
    Ms. Berner [continuing]. About the history----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Notes over to us. You didn't 
read them before you turned them over?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I've spoken on a number of occasions 
about the history. I was not speaking about----
    Senator Kennedy. Are you're saying that you didn't say 
that?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I've spoken on a number of occasions--
--
    Senator Kennedy. Ma'am----
    Ms. Berner [continuing]. About the history.
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Are you saying that you 
didn't say that?
    Ms. Berner. If--I have turned over all of my notes from my 
speeches.
    Senator Kennedy. I don't think you're telling the truth, 
Ms. Berner. Let me--let me ask you another question. Do you 
remember Mary--or rather, Mindy Sturge?
    Ms. Berner. No, sir----
    Senator Kennedy. I'm----
    Ms. Berner [continuing]. I do not remember.
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. I'm embarrassed you don't 
remember her. She was one of your union members. She alleged 
that she was the victim of sexual discrimination at one of 
her--of one of your local unions.
    This is what she said. She alleged that one of the 
executives there asked her, quote, ``if she enjoyed rough sex 
and bondage.'' She said that the chapter president, Mr. Dave 
Regan, asked her, quote, ``Does the carpet match the drapes? '' 
And, quote, ``What would you do for some jewelry? '' She 
alleged that Mr. Regan told another staffer, quote, ``that the 
only way she is getting a job is if she sucks my'' member of 
the male anatomy.
    Another employee said, in an affidavit, that Mr. Reagan, 
quote, ``went around asking women if he could sniff their 
panties,'' closed quote, at an October 2017 work party. She 
said another executive, quote, ``grabbed my upper thigh while I 
was driving.'' And she wrote you and asked you to investigate, 
and you said, no. Didn't you?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I have dedicated my career to 
representing women and families. That has been my work.
    Senator Kennedy. You said, no. Didn't you?
    Ms. Berner. Senator----
    Senator Kennedy. You told her that--that, let her own 
chapter represent--or, investigate its own misconduct. Didn't 
you?
    [Gavel is tapped.]
    Chair Durbin. Senator, I'm going to give you additional 
time, but I want the witness to be able to fully answer the 
question.
    Ms. Berner. Senator, the letter that you are quoting from, 
I wrote in my capacity as counsel to my client. It was the 
position of my client, and I was an--acting as an advocate.
    Senator Kennedy. You refused to investigate, though. Didn't 
you?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I believe that I have faithfully 
adhered to my obligations as an attorney for my client----
    Senator Kennedy. I don't think Ms. Sturge would agree with 
you. In fact, Mr. Regan, the chapter president, is still the 
president. Isn't he?
    Ms. Berner. I believe----
    Senator Kennedy. You don't even know?
    Ms. Berner. I--Dave Regan is the president of one of our 
local unions----
    Senator Kennedy. Wow.
    Ms. Berner [continuing]. Of one of SEIU's local unions, 
yes.
    Senator Kennedy. Wow.
    Mr. Mangi, I just want to be sure I understand your 
testimony, sir. And congratulations, by the way.
    Mr. Mangi. Thank you.
    Senator Kennedy. From 2019 to 2023, you were a board member 
of the Center for Security, Race and Rights at Rutgers Law 
School. Is that right?
    Mr. Mangi. I was a member of an advisory board, Senator.
    Senator Kennedy. Right. Most boards advise. Don't they?
    Mr. Mangi. Well, Senator, boards of directors govern an 
institution. Advisory boards do not have a governance role. 
They merely provide counsel.
    Senator Kennedy. Do you know of any boards that don't offer 
advice?
    Mr. Mangi. Well, they're different in their legal function.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. You all held an event on the 20th 
anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack on America. You held 
an event on the 20th anniversary attack--9/11 attack on 
America.
    And you invited as speakers--your first speaker was Dr. 
Sami Al-Arian. He was convicted of conspiring to provide 
material support--convicted in a court--to the Palestinian 
Islamic Jihad, and the Islamic Jihad participated in the 
October 7th massacre and mass rape.
    Your second speaker was Dr. Rabab Abdulhadi, who has 
organized panels for the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine--one terrorist, Leila Khaled. Ms. Khaled hijacked 
planes. You invited her as a speaker--or, her mentor as a 
speaker.
    The third speaker you invited, Mr. Hatem Bazian, was the 
co-founder of Students for Justice in Palestine, and has 
publicly called for an intifada in the United States. Is this 
the way you celebrate 9/11? Have I said anything that was 
inaccurate?
    Mr. Mangi. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Kennedy. Tell me.
    [Gavel is tapped.]
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, my involvement with the Center at 
Rutgers Law School, which is a preeminent law school in the 
State of New Jersey----
    Senator Kennedy. I can tell.
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. Is on an advisory board that, when 
my role was limited to providing advice on academic areas of 
research, primarily through a meeting held once a year.
    With regard to the event that you are describing, I've 
never heard of that event prior to today. It was never 
presented to the advisory board that I was part of. I know 
nothing about it. I know nothing about the speakers. I've never 
heard of any of those people. So----
    Senator Kennedy. How could you sit on an organization that 
would invite these terrorists--convicted terrorists, counselor?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, it is an advisory----
    Senator Kennedy. You didn't resign.
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I never heard of that event until 
today. It is an advisory board where my role----
    Senator Kennedy. So, you just had an epiphany today?
    Chair Durbin. Senator, your time has expired.
    Mr. Mangi. May I respond.
    Chair Durbin. Would you like to complete your answer?
    Mr. Mangi. Yes. I have never heard of this event prior 
today. It had nothing to do with my role on an advisory board.
    Senator Kennedy. But you're on the board.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Klobuchar.
    Mr. Mangi. Advisory Board.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just keep 
thinking about all of us having gone to schools, or served on 
committees, or doing things that are not--when we're not the 
decision-makers about things. And if we were all held 
responsible for that, I don't think any of us would be up here.
    So, I want to start with you, Mr. Mangi. Could you talk 
about your years of experience? Your trailblazing nomination we 
know about. Can you talk a little bit--I see your proud family 
behind you--of your family's history, and how that has 
influenced your view of the rule of law?
    Mr. Mangi. Thank you, Senator. Senator, I grew up in 
Pakistan, and that is a country the people of whom I love 
dearly. It's part of my heritage, it's part of my history. But 
a big part of my experience growing up was seeing that, in that 
country, if your rights are violated, there is often no 
recourse, there is no remedy, and the legal system will not 
come to your aid. Indeed, the legal system will often be the 
one that's suppressing you in the first place, particularly if 
you are a woman or a minority.
    And that experience impressed upon me, so deeply, the value 
of being in a country and in a place where if your rights have 
been trampled upon--like in the case of the Islamic Society of 
Basking Ridge, I mentioned earlier--you can go to the courts 
and you can get recourse. And for me, that is what the 
conception of justice is all about.
    And let me add, Senator, responding to your predicate. I 
have a history of 23 years now in this country as a lawyer 
working on various causes that are important to me, and I'm 
ready to----
    Senator Klobuchar. You mean, in the private sector. 
Correct? For many years----
    Mr. Mangi. Yes, Senator. And I'm happy to answer for any 
decision I have made, any statement I have made, but it has to 
be something that I've done.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay, very good. Thank you. And we do 
appreciate--we had, I'm sure you've heard, the mosque in 
Minnesota that got bombed. FBI actually investigated from the 
guy that did it. So, appreciate your work on that front, as 
does our Muslim community
    Ms. Berner, one thing we haven't talked much about is your 
work on domestic violence. And the Committee received a letter 
of support for your nomination from the National Task Force to 
End Sexual and Domestic Violence, which praised your background 
and experience with issues of domestic violence and sexual 
assault.
    A former prosecutor, we worked on a lot of these cases, had 
a domestic violence service center in my office that was very 
well known nationally. Can you talk more about your work to 
protect victims of domestic violence and sexual assault?
    Ms. Berner. Good morning, Senator, and thank you for your 
question. Before I went to law school, I was the director of a 
national organization in Israel to fight domestic violence and 
sexual assault of women. And it was in that capacity that I 
first came to meet attorneys. I had had no lawyers in my 
family, and I had not previously known any attorneys. And I saw 
the power that the law can bring to protect those who are not 
always able to protect themselves, to advocate on behalf of 
women, and families, and children. And it was--I was inspired 
by that work to apply to law school and to become a lawyer.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Very good. And I know the 
Committee received a letter of support for your nomination from 
the International Brotherhood of Police Officers. They praised 
your work on behalf of law enforcement as well as your 
excellent legal talent, deep listening skills, and 
collaborative and fair approach. Can you talk about the work 
that you've done in law enforcement outside of domestic 
violence?
    Ms. Berner. Yes, Senator. I have been proud to represent 
tens of thousands of police officers and correctional officers 
from around the United States. I have deep respect for their 
role in our society, their courage, and their commitment to 
protect communities.
    And it has been my honor to protect those members of SEIU, 
and to work closely with union members from every industry in 
our country. And I am humbled by the support from different 
unions that have come to support my nomination, including 
police unions, and firefighters, and other unions that have 
come to support my nomination. It has been truly humbling.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Blackburn.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and 
congratulations to each of you on your nominations.
    Ms. Berner, I do want to come to you. There's been much 
discussion about your work as general counsel at the SEIU.
    And I am the top Republican on the Human Rights and the Law 
Subcommittee. We put a lot of work into looking at the human 
trafficking, the sex trafficking, sexual assault issue. And 
Senator Gillibrand and I, just recently in the last year, 
passed a piece of legislation, the Speak Out Act, which would 
disallow pre-dispute nondisclosure agreements in these cases of 
sexual assault.
    So, I know that Senator Lee and Senator Kennedy have asked 
you about this issue, and I'm going to come back to you on it 
because it is extremely concerning to me. And when we look at 
the courts, when we look at the Federal Government, when we 
look at corporations--and we discussed this issue yesterday in 
a hearing on corporate conduct--the fact that this is 
continuing is of concern to us.
    And your actions--what we see as being your actions--in the 
case with Ms. Sturge, with Mr. Regan, is incredibly disturbing 
because it appears that the union knew about these allegations 
and the union failed to take action, and then they continued to 
support the men that had carried out these allegations.
    And when you look at the conduct of Mr. Regan and the fact 
that he is still there, and the fact that he was known--this 
wasn't something that was hearsay, he was known for going to 
conferences, for getting drunk at the conference, and 
inappropriately dancing with female employees. So, this was 
known behavior and conduct. And what it appears is, this is 
just the tip of the iceberg with what took place at the SEIU. 
And one of his, Mr. Regan's, top lieutenants, Stan Lyles, was 
also accused of misconduct.
    So, you can see our concern. It looks like this conduct was 
standard operating procedure and that it was accepted and 
expected, and you did nothing about it. And that is the 
impression that is being given to us. And your hesitancy to 
answer these questions, and come forward with an answer, really 
does cause us concern.
    Now, in responding to Mr. Lyles' accuser, Mindy Sturge, you 
said that the matter was best left to be investigated by the 
local SEIU, the same union whose president Ms. Sturge was suing 
for sexual misconduct. So, this is inconceivable. What was your 
expectation about this woman getting a fair outcome from having 
the abuser actually handle the investigation? Did you expect 
him to say, ``I was wrong'' ? Did you expect him to handle it 
fairly? Because the answer would be, of course, the guy's not 
going to be fair because the woman is accusing him. And this is 
exactly why we moved forward with cleaning this process up.
    So, the appearance, to us, is that you were a party to 
this--allowing this bad conduct. And it causes me pain to think 
that at a time when we are trying to get to the bottom of 
what's happening with this sexual assault, with these sex 
trafficking rings, that you, as a judge, would sit on a Federal 
bench, and a woman who is coming before you to have justice 
would not be given a fair shot at that justice.
    So, do you regret this? Do you think these people should be 
removed? What is your position and how would you like to 
clarify the record? Because right now, this--allowing this 
misconduct, pushing it to the abuser to handle a case of the 
accuser, this is something that is unacceptable.
    Ms. Berner. Senator, I have dedicated my career to 
representing women and families, and I take every allegation of 
sexual assault and sexual misconduct seriously, whether levied 
at my client or whether it is an allegation----
    Senator Blackburn. This is a stark remark. And Mr. 
Chairman, I know I'm over time----
    [Gavel is tapped.]
    Senator Blackburn [continuing]. But we have----
    Chair Durbin. Senator----
    Senator Blackburn [continuing]. Got to get----
    Chair Durbin. Senator----
    Senator Blackburn [continuing]. To the bottom.
    Chair Durbin. Senator----
    Senator Blackburn. Yes.
    Chair Durbin. I'm going to give her the right to complete 
her answer.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you. That's wonderful. Thank you.
    Ms. Berner. Senator, what I can tell you is that I take all 
allegations of sexual assault seriously, that I have faithfully 
carried out my role as an advocate. And that, if I were so 
fortunate as to be confirmed, any position that I had taken on 
behalf of a client would not be coming to any--would not have 
any relevance to any decision that I made as a judge. My 
positions taken as an advocate were, I was advocating on behalf 
of my client.
    And if I were to be confirmed, I would be in the role of a 
neutral where I would faithfully apply the relevant precedent 
to the facts in the case before me. And I would do as I have 
done throughout my career.
    Senator Blackburn. You had a chance----
    Chair Durbin. Senator Hirono.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As I sit here 
listening to all of these questions, I'm glad that my 
colleagues care about nominees who come before us who may not 
provide the kind of support for people who are making 
allegations of sexual harassment.
    As far as I'm concerned, we did not do that adequately 
during the Kavanaugh hearings, but we obviously have a 
difference of opinion as to who should have been called as 
witnesses before this Committee.
    So, to begin, I ask all nominees the following two initial 
questions because we need to ascertain that all of the nominees 
would never engage in this kind of conduct. So, my initial 
questions, and I know you're familiar with the fact that I ask 
these two questions.
    So, I ask both of you, starting with Ms. Berger: Since you 
became a legal adult, have you ever made unwanted requests for 
sexual favors, or committed any verbal or physical harassment, 
or assault of a sexual nature?
    Ms. Berner. No, Senator.
    Mr. Mangi. No, Senator.
    Senator Hirono. Have you ever faced discipline, or entered 
into a settlement, relating to this kind of conduct?
    Ms. Berner. No, Senator.
    Mr. Mangi. No, Senator.
    Senator Hirono. Listening to both of you, it is very clear 
in my mind that you represented your various clients very 
zealously, and we've had, believe me, many nominees of a former 
President who I very much questioned where they were coming 
from, whether they would be able to set aside their 
ideological--very clear ideological perspectives in making 
decisions based on a fair assessment, an objective assessment 
of the case before them.
    And listening to both of you, I believe that both of you 
would be able to do that. I'm very impressed with your 
backgrounds--and by the way, Ms. Berner, I appreciate the fact 
that your family has come all the way from Israel to support 
you. Family is obviously really important to you. And you 
mentioned a concept, tikkun olam. It's a Jewish phrase. Would 
you like to just expand a little bit how you seek to live up to 
this phrase?
    Ms. Berner. Thank you, Senator. Tikkun olam is a Hebrew 
phrase that means repairing the world. And in my work as a 
lawyer, I have represented individuals who have not always had 
a voice in our society.
    Senator Hirono. Mm-hmm.
    Ms. Berner. And in that capacity, I believe that I have 
fulfilled the Jewish mandate to repair the world.
    If I were so fortunate as to be confirmed as a judge, I 
would step into a different role, to take part in a system of 
justice that is truly a model. And I would be committed deeply 
to treating each litigant fairly, and to approach every case 
with an open mind, and to faithfully apply the law. And that, 
too, would be a form of tikkun olam.
    Senator Hirono. Mr. Mangi. Mangi?
    Mr. Mangi. Mangi, Senator.
    Senator Hirono. Mangi, sorry. Thank you. You are not 
Jewish, but I believe that you also aspire to make the world a 
better place. And I was referring to the fact that you have 
spent some 4,000 hours representing clients in pro bono cases. 
And I don't know how much you charge by the hour, but you 
probably charge more than $200 an hour. And so, when I did the 
math, that's almost $1 million dollars' worth of pro bono work 
for people who were--who faced religious discrimination, 
employment discrimination, and you also took asylum cases.
    Can you tell this Committee why this pro bono work is so 
important to you? And thank you very much for explaining that 
pro bono work means a lot to your law firm, and that they don't 
just let anybody take on this kind of work, but they have--they 
have faith in you to do the work. Can you explain why this work 
is so important to you?
    Mr. Mangi. Certainly, Senator. Senator, in a large New York 
law firm, as a partner at that law firm, you have command of 
tremendous resources: incredibly talented, energetic, young 
associates, resources to pay for things like expert witnesses, 
and so on.
    So, if you have an opportunity to bring those resources to 
bear on the side of just causes, then there can be no better 
way to participate in the civic life of our country. And while 
our justice system is a great and wonderful thing, a paucity of 
resources can still impact what sort of justice you can access. 
So being able to bring those resources to bear on critical 
issues is deeply satisfying to me, and indeed to everyone at my 
law firm, which is why it's an embedded part of our culture.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, very much. And I'm also really 
grateful that you believe in religious diversity. And, as the 
only Buddhist ever to be elected to the United States Senate, 
thank you for your advocacy on behalf of religious diversity.
    Mr. Mangi. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Hirono. Senator Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Mangi, last week, the American people were horrified to 
watch the testimony of the presidents of Harvard, MIT, and 
Penn, where all three of them failed to speak clearly, 
denouncing anti-Semitism. All three of them had difficulty--in 
fact, refused to say that calls for genocide of the Jewish 
people constitute harassment, at their policies. One of those 
three presidents has since resigned. I think the other two are 
likely to resign, and should resign.
    I will say, when I look at your record, I am troubled by a 
number of things, but I'm perhaps most troubled by the fact 
that you served as an advisory board member for the Center for 
Security, Race and Rights at Rutgers Law School from 2019 to 
2023. And sadly, I think that center embraces the same 
extremism and myopia that we saw on display from the presidents 
of Harvard, MIT, and Penn.
    While you were a board member, on May 29th, 2021, Professor 
Sahar Aziz, who's the director of the center on which you 
served as an advisory board member, signed a letter which was 
posted on the center's website, which read, quote, ``A cease-
fire does not end the colonial conditions of the structural 
violence and inequality that Palestinians live under.''
    It goes on to say, quote, ``The Palestinian rights to 
freedom, security in their homes, to return self-determination, 
and to be free of violent occupation are well established under 
international law. The language of both-sidedness, of 
timeliness, or religious conflict with moments of escalation 
erases the military, economic, media, and diplomatic power that 
Israel as an occupying force has over Palestine.''
    Do you agree with those sentiments?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator Cruz, let me say first, with regard to 
the genocide issue that you raised, any calls for genocide of 
any people are absolutely horrific. Horrific. And there could 
be nothing that is more contrary and antithetical to everything 
that I stand for.
    Senator Cruz. Good.
    Mr. Mangi. Now, with regard to the center, as I mentioned 
earlier, I served on an advisory board. Its function was to 
meet approximately once a year, and to focus on what areas of 
academic research at Rutgers Law School might be productive to 
engage in. For example----
    Senator Cruz. So, you signed up to be on an advisory board, 
and you just didn't know what they were doing. You just didn't 
treat the responsibility very seriously?
    Mr. Mangi. The responsibility, Senator, was to advise on 
areas of academic research, not on day-to-day----
    Senator Cruz. So, I want to return--you're a practicing 
lawyer. I want to return to the question I asked.
    Mr. Mangi. Yes.
    Senator Cruz. Which is, do you agree with the sentiments 
that I just read you from the director of the center on whose 
advisory board you served?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I have no knowledge of that speech or 
statements that you----
    Senator Cruz. Do you believe----
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. Are referencing.
    Senator Cruz [continuing]. That Israel is an occupying 
force in Palestine?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, the history of that region is very 
complex, and I don't claim to be an expert in it.
    Senator Cruz. All right. Let me ask you this. Same letter 
posted by the same director, quote, ``We are in awe of the 
Palestinian struggle to resist violent occupation, removal, 
erasure, and the expansion of Israeli settler colonialism.'' Do 
you agree with that sentiment?
    Mr. Mangi. I'd give you--I'll give you the same answer, 
Senator, which is----
    Senator Cruz. You don't know?
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. Which is, that is a very complex 
history in the region----
    Senator Cruz. Complex--that means context?
    Mr. Mangi. No, it means it is a history that is a domain of 
policymakers.
    Senator Cruz. So, no. No, it is not. Israel is not a 
violent occupier engaged in settler colonialism. That is a 
political statement, and you are unwilling to disagree with it, 
which suggests there's a reason you were on that board. There 
was a reason. It's actually quite remarkable that you're not 
even willing to disclaim the statement, ``We're in awe of the 
Palestinian struggle to resist,'' in light of October 7th.
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I stated this earlier, but let me 
repeat it, because I think it's critically important.
    Senator Cruz. Do you condemn the atrocities of the Hamas 
terrorists?
    Mr. Mangi. Yes. That's what I was about to address, 
Senator. The events----
    Senator Cruz. Is there any----
    Chair Durbin. Let him finish----
    Senator Cruz [continuing]. Any justification----
    Chair Durbin [continuing]. Let him finish the answering the 
question.
    Senator Cruz [continuing]. Is there any justification for 
those atrocities?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I'll repeat myself. The events of 
October 7th were a horror, involving the deaths of innocent 
civilians. That is contrary----
    Senator Cruz. I'm going to ask the question again. Is there 
any justification for those atrocities?
    Mr. Mangi. That was going to be my next sentence, Senator, 
which is, I have no patience, none, for any attempts to justify 
or defend those events----
    Senator Cruz. Well, let me--let me ask you this: What do 
you think about the fact that the center, on whose board you 
served, hosted----
    [Poster is displayed.]
    Senator Cruz [continuing]. On the 20th anniversary of 
September 11th, an event with a convicted terrorist who pleaded 
guilty? Dr. Sami Al-Arian was convicted of conspiracy to 
contribute services or benefits to a terrorist organization, 
and Dr. Hatem Bazian explicitly called for an intifada against 
the United States. Do you agree with those sentiments?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I'd like to say two things on that 
point.
    Number one, on 9/11, I was in New York. I saw what 
happened. It was my city that was attacked.
    Number two, I've never heard of this event prior to today. 
It was never brought to the advisory board, which met once a 
year to talk about academic issues----
    Senator Cruz. Are you willing to denounce the center on 
whose board you served, inviting a convicted terrorist, a 
supporter of Palestinian Islamic----
    [Gavel is tapped.]
    Senator Cruz [continuing]. Jihad--by the way, Palestinian 
Islamic Jihad participated in the October 7th atrocities. Are 
you willing to condemn their inviting a supporter of their--to 
attack America, and to support the reasons for the September 
11th attacks?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I don't think anyone can feel more 
strongly about what happened on 9/11 than someone who was 
there, who saw with their own eyes smoke billowing from the 
Towers----
    Senator Cruz. But you won't condemn this?
    Mr. Mangi. I will----
    Chair Durbin. Senator, let him complete his answer. Would 
you? Your time is----
    Senator Cruz. He's filibustering and not answering 
questions.
    Chair Durbin. He's not filibustering----
    Senator Cruz. So, I'm going to ask him----
    Chair Durbin. Senator----
    Senator Cruz [continuing]. To answer the question I asked--
--
    Chair Durbin [continuing]. Senator----
    Senator Cruz [continuing]. Instead of giving a speech on a 
different topic.----
    Chair Durbin [continuing]. Senator----
    Senator Cruz [continuing]. And Mr. Chairman, you do this 
all the time.
    Chair Durbin. I do?
    Senator Cruz. When a question is going badly for a Democrat 
witness, you jump in and try to save the witness. He knows how 
to answer a question. When I ask a question, he gives a speech 
on a different topic because he doesn't want to answer it. My 
question is simple----
    [Gavel is tapped three times.]
    Senator Cruz [continuing]. Do you condemn this event that 
was celebrating Palestinian Islamic Jihad, yes or no?
    Chair Durbin. You should not bully the witnesses, nor try 
to bully Members of the Committee. Complete----
    Senator Cruz. Asking a question is not bullying.
    Chair Durbin [continuing]. Complete your answer, please.
    Mr. Mangi. Thank you, Chair Durbin. I'll answer your 
question very directly, Senator Cruz. I will condemn without 
equivocation, any terrorism, any terrorist, or any act of 
terrorism, or any defense of any act of terrorism [points to 
poster on display]. I don't know----
    Senator Cruz. And this event?
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. I don't know this event [points to 
poster on display]. I don't know anything about this event, or 
who these people are--I've never heard of any of them. If 
someone on there is a terrorist, I'd condemn them.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Welch.
    Senator Welch. I want to ask some--give you some 
opportunity to follow up with some of the questions. The 
underlying concern that some of my colleagues have is a valid 
concern. If a person who's going to serve as the judge is 
advocating terrorism, or supports terrorism, or sexual 
misconduct, then that would be a disqualifier.
    But on the other hand, if a person has worked in a lot, in 
an organization for a significant period of time, they're not 
involved in every single personnel issue. Or if a person has a 
Muslim background and served as an advisory board, it doesn't 
necessarily mean they subscribe or even are aware of the views 
of everybody who shows up.
    And I'll say, I served as a public defender, and I 
represented some really bad people who did some really bad 
things. And, in some of my political life, people attacked me 
for my defending people that the court assigned me to 
represent--ascribing to me an advocacy of the conduct, as 
opposed to an advocacy of the right that our Constitution 
provides people for a fair defense.
    And I'm getting a sense that's happening, to some extent, 
to each of you.
    So, Mr. Mangi, I'll just ask you first. That was an 
eloquent statement about how your experience in Pakistan and 
how you saw that there was not an ability to have rights 
respected because there wasn't the institutions of the rule of 
law there. I find that quite inspiring. But just flat out, is 
there any--is there any hesitation on your part to condemn 
genocide?
    Mr. Mangi. No.
    Senator Welch. And is there any--any hesitation on your 
part to condemn any person who commits terrorist activities and 
violence toward innocent people?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, no hesitation whatsoever. And let me 
add, that if anyone has aspirations to attack minority 
communities or indeed to attack the Jewish community here in 
America, they'd have to go through me first.
    Senator Welch. Right. And so, you condemn what Hamas did to 
innocent Israelis on October 7th, and you condemn what 
terrorists did to New York on 9/11?
    Mr. Mangi. Of course.
    Senator Welch. Okay, thank you. And Ms. Berner, you are 
being--you served 17 years at SEIU?
    Ms. Berner. I came to SEIU as an attorney in 2006, and I 
have served as its general counsel since 2017.
    Senator Welch. All right. And then you've been asked some 
questions by my colleague, Ms. Blackburn, about apparently, a 
personnel incident. Do you want to just elaborate on what it is 
you knew or didn't know about that?
    Ms. Berner. Senator, the personnel incident that I was 
asked about did not occur at SEIU.
    Senator Welch. Yes.
    Ms. Berner. The incident occurred at one of SEIU's local 
affiliates, which are separately incorporated, separately 
managed, and separately governed. What I will say is that my 
involvement in any matter, on behalf of my client, would be the 
topic of, of course, attorney-client privilege. I have served 
as a zealous advocate for my client, and in my 25 years of 
practicing law, I have represented corporations and unions. 
I've represented individuals, as both defendants and 
plaintiffs, and in every case, I have fulfilled my obligation 
as a lawyer to be a zealous advocate. And I understand that the 
role of a judge is very different.
    Senator Welch. Right. And has there ever been a time on a 
personnel matter where you were responsible for the supervision 
of an employee where an allegation of sexual misconduct was 
brought to your attention that you disregarded?
    Ms. Berner. No, Senator.
    Senator Welch. Okay, thank you. I yield back.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Welch. Senator Hawley.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations to 
the nominees. Thanks for being here.
    Mr. Mangi, if I could just start with you. I just want to 
make sure I understood your answers to my colleagues, and 
setting--including Senator Cruz.
    Let me just read you something. I just want to know if you 
agree with this or not. This should be simple. Here's a 
statement: ``The demand to center Israel's right to self-
defense''--that's in scare quotes, ``self-defense''--``erases 
the colonial context and delegitimizes the Palestinian right to 
resistance. We are in awe of the Palestinian struggle to resist 
violent occupation, removal, erasure, and the expansion of the 
Israeli settler colonialism.''
    Do you agree with that, yes or no? I realize you didn't 
write it, and you may not know who the author is, may never 
have heard of these people before. I just want to know, does 
this represent your view, yes or no?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, any attempt to justify what happened on 
October 7th, I have absolutely no----
    Senator Hawley. Well, that's not the context here. This is 
talking about any discussion of Israel's right to self-defense 
erases the colonial context. It's calling Israel a colonial 
state. So, could we just answer my question? Do you agree with 
this, yes or no?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I don't claim to be an expert on the 
Middle East. I don't have the historic or regional expertise--
--
    Senator Hawley. It sounds like a maybe. That's a maybe? 
Maybe you agree?
    Mr. Mangi. No.
    Senator Hawley. Can we get a yes or a no?
    Mr. Mangi. I'd say this is a policy question, or a 
question----
    Senator Hawley. Well, no----
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. For a foreign expert.
    Senator Hawley [continuing]. Wait, wait, what's--I don't--
that's what I don't understand. By the way, this was written by 
the director of the center you'd sat on the board of--that you 
advised. This was the director. Not some random professor, the 
director, who published it in an open letter. So, when you say 
it's a policy, what's the policy about calling Israel a 
violent, settler colonial estate? Why is that a policy 
question?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, that is not a statement that I had any 
involvement with.
    Senator Hawley. Okay, good. So, would you--would you 
condemn it then? You'd say this does not represent your views?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I have no basis as a judicial nominee 
to cast views on the Middle East, or----
    Senator Hawley. Ah----
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. What does----
    Senator Hawley [continuing]. You're not----
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. Or does not----
    Senator Hawley [continuing]. See, this is what----
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. Happen there.
    Senator Hawley. You're not answering my question. I'm 
asking you whether this individual, who said that Israel was a 
violent, settler colonial state--I'm just trying to get you to 
say, do you agree with that or not? And you--I've asked you now 
four different times, four different ways. You're not answering 
me. Why is that? Why can't you just say, ``No, I don't agree 
with this.'' Let's try again.
    Mr. Mangi. Yes.
    Senator Hawley. Do you agree with this statement, yes or 
no?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, in order to agree, or disagree, with 
any statement, I need to have a sufficient factual background--
--
    Senator Hawley. Okay----
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. To assess it.
    Senator Hawley [continuing]. So, you--in other words, you 
can't say whether or not Israel's a violent, colonial state. 
You think that that's a difficult----
    [Voice off microphone.] Oh, God.
    Senator Hawley [continuing]. Question?
    Mr. Mangi. That is not an issue with which I have any 
expertise. I----
    Senator Hawley. Is the Holocaust also a difficult question? 
Does that need context?
    Mr. Mangi. No.
    Senator Hawley. Is that a policy question?
    Mr. Mangi. I am quite happy to address the Holocaust, 
Senator----
    Senator Hawley. Why aren't you happy to address this then? 
Why aren't you--why is it that an individual on the center, 
that you directed, who calls Israel a violent, colonial 
estate--those are racist comments--why can't you condemn that? 
I don't understand it. You--you won't answer my questions. You 
won't answer Senator Cruz's questions. You wouldn't answer 
Senator Kennedy's questions. I don't understand why this is 
complicated.
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I am Pakistani. I didn't grow up in the 
Middle East----
    Senator Hawley. I didn't----
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. I don't have----
    Senator Hawley [continuing]. Either. I didn't either, but 
that doesn't mean that I can't say that somebody who says that 
a Jewish state is a violent, colonialist enterprise is wrong. 
This isn't a policy question. It's a moral question. This is a 
moral issue.
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I am not in a position to make any 
policy pronouncements about actions in the Middle East.
    Senator Hawley. Does Israel have a right to exist?
    Mr. Mangi. Yes.
    Senator Hawley. Should--should American Jews be safe in 
their homes and on their campuses?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, there is no one----
    Senator Hawley. Just yes or no. Please, spare me the 
lectures. Yes or no?
    Mr. Mangi. Of course----
    Senator Hawley [continuing]. Did you advise against this 
[holds up a document] letter? You sat on the advisory board. 
Did you advise against it?
    Mr. Mangi. I never even heard of that letter.
    Senator Hawley. You--how is that possible? What did you do 
on this board for all these years? This was years before you 
left it.
    Mr. Mangi. It's an advisory board that met once a year to 
talk about academic research.
    Senator Hawley. Did you not--do you not think it's relevant 
to the setting in the academy that Jewish students might feel 
unsafe when they have a tenured professor, who's the director 
of a center, saying that Israel is a violent, colonial state? 
Do you think that might not have an effect on the educational 
environment?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I abhor, abhor----
    Senator Hawley. But you didn't care to look into it?
    Mr. Mangi. May I respond?
    Senator Hawley. But--you've respond--I've heard your 
answers and they're all--they're all, move over here, look over 
here. You're not answering any of my questions, and I can't 
figure out why. I can't figure out why you won't just say that 
this was wrong. So, you didn't advise against it. You didn't 
condemn it. You didn't look into the center's activities. Do 
you--do you regret that? Do you regret not, at the time, taking 
a moral stand against these, frankly, racist condemnations of 
Jewish Americans, Jewish people in the state of Israel. Do you 
think it was wrong for you to be silent?
    Mr. Mangi. Senator, I didn't know anything about it.
    Senator Hawley. Why didn't you? Didn't you have a moral 
obligation to know about a center that you sat on the board of, 
for years, whose director was calling Jewish people 
colonialist, violent settlers? Do you not have a moral 
obligation to know and say something?
    Mr. Mangi. That is not the function of an academic advisory 
board, but I abhor----
    Senator Hawley. But it is the----
    Mr. Mangi [continuing]. Any anti-Semitist----
    Senator Hawley [continuing]. Function of a responsible 
jurist, and a responsible citizen. And I would just suggest to 
you that you failed it, and your inability to just say, this 
was wrong, this shouldn't have been said. This--this [holds up 
a document and shakes it] kind of language and rhetoric is what 
has led directly to Jewish-American students now being called 
out on campuses, in classrooms, told to stand up and go and 
stand in a corner, because they need to feel what it's like to 
be colonized. I'm sure you've seen the reports of this 
happening across the country. This is happening now.
    Chair Durbin. Senator, your time's expired. Mr. Mangi, 
would you like to complete your answer?
    Mr. Mangi. Thank you, Chair Durbin. Any acts of anti-
Semitism, or any bigotry, including anti-Muslim bigotry, on 
college campuses is abhorrent. My children will be going to 
university soon. I want them to feel safe, and I want the 
children of my Jewish friends and colleagues to feel safe, 
too----
    Senator Hawley. Well, you think you'll take a greater 
interest when your children are on campus, maybe, than you did 
for the last 3 years?
    Chair Durbin. Senator, your time has expired.
    I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter 
received December 8th, 2023, addressed to me, Senator Graham, 
and all Committee Members. It reads in part, ``On behalf of the 
210,000 advocates of the National Council of Jewish Women, I'm 
writing in support of the nomination of Adeel Mangi to the 
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.''
    It goes on to say, ``The National Council of Jewish Women 
believes the judiciary is best served by qualified judges who 
are fair-minded and independent, reflect the diversity of our 
Nation. Adeel Mangi is just such a nominee. We strongly urge 
you to move expeditiously to approve this nomination, and 
support subsequent confirmation by the full Senate.''
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Chair Durbin. I am sorry that you have been subjected to 
the suggestion that you are somehow any anti-Semitic or 
insensitive. This letter indicates those people who looked at 
your record feel just the opposite. Senator Padilla.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    You know, I've been on this Committee nearly 3 years now. 
Well, first of all, let me thank and welcome the nominees 
before us today for your willingness to serve. I mentioned I've 
been on this Committee now for almost 3 years, and have been 
part of numerous, numerous hearings like this. I know we're not 
voting to confirm today and to advance to the full Senate, but 
I have learned this much about the Senate Judiciary Committee 
and these nomination hearings: You two don't just [snaps 
fingers] get here like that.
    There's certainly a, either an interest in serving 
expressed on your part and/or a process by which professionals, 
who advise Members of the Senate on who would be a good member 
of the Federal judiciary, conducts some initial outreach, some 
initial background, some initial vetting, both of professional 
experience and personal experience. And if you meet that 
threshold, then a name is put forward to a Member of the United 
States Senate to consider, where there's additional background 
and vetting, that's done professionally and personally.
    Same for the set of names being submitted to the White 
House for consideration, and certainly for not just district 
court judges, but for circuit court judges. The White House 
does its share of background, and vetting, and research on 
individuals, both professionally and personally.
    So, the fact that you two are before us for consideration 
says a lot about the two of you, in contrast to some of the 
questions and treatment that you've been subject to during the 
course of this hearing.
    Mr. Chairman, I applaud the letters that you have entered 
into the record, and I'm inspired to submit a couple of 
additional ones.
    One from the New Jersey State Bar Association, addressed to 
both the Chair and the Ranking Member of this Committee, in 
support of the nomination of Adeel Mangi.
    And I'll just read a sentence, or two, here: ``Time and 
time again, he has demonstrated a commitment to improving the 
law, and the community, through legal efforts that have 
supported foundational rights for those in our State. He also 
brings to the position the knowledge of a seasoned practitioner 
and, once confirmed, he will unquestionably be an asset to the 
U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals, all those served by that 
court, in particular the people of our State.'' I ask that this 
letter be subject--be entered into the record, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Without objection.
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Senator Padilla. A second letter, this one in support of 
Ms. Berner's nomination: ``We share a special bond with 
Nicole,'' quote, ``all of us had the honor of clerking for 
Judge Betty Fletcher on the Ninth Circuit, and we are diverse 
in our viewpoints and backgrounds, and our careers span the 
breadth of the legal profession.''
    Going on in the letter: ``We have no doubt that Nicole,'' 
Ms. Berner, ``will bring her exceptional talents to bear as a 
Fourth Circuit judge. Certainly, she will bring her brilliant 
mind and tremendous work ethic, but also her commitment to 
ensuring that ordinary people receive the same fair hearing and 
equal treatment as anyone else arguing before her.'' Signed by 
a few dozen former clerks of that particular court. I ask that 
we submit this one into the record, as well.
    Chair Durbin. Without objection.
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Senator Padilla. And finally, a statement from the 
Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights who, an entity 
that this Committee turns to for affirmation of who may be a 
good nominee or not, particularly on civil rights issues, also, 
in support of Ms. Berner for the Fourth Circuit.
    I don't have any questions, folks. I just wanted to kind of 
level set the conversation here in this hearing with the 
professional opinion of folks that you respect, that we 
respect, is much more meaningful and relevant for consideration 
in this decision. And thank you, both, and your families, for 
supporting you in this opportunity to serve. Thank you, Mr. 
Chair.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Ms. Berner and Mr. Mangi, for 
being here today. And there may be some written questions sent 
your way, which we hope you will respond to in a timely 
fashion.
    Thank you, again, and to your friends and family, for 
joining in this effort. You are free to go, and then we'll 
reset for our second panel. Thank you.
    Mr. Mangi. Thank you.
    [Pause.]
    Chair Durbin. Are the nominees at the table? Yes, they are. 
If you could please stand and raise your right hand.
    [Witnesses are sworn in.]
    Chair Durbin. The record reflects they all answered in the 
affirmative, and so we start with Judge Baggio. You have 5 
minutes to introduce yourself.

  STATEMENT OF HON. AMY M. BAGGIO, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS UNITED 
        STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF OREGON

    Judge Baggio. Thank you, Chair. Words cannot describe the 
utter awe that I feel at being here today. I thank President 
Biden for nominating me. I thank Senators Wyden and Merkley for 
supporting my nomination, and for their kind remarks at the 
beginning of today's hearing. I thank our local judicial 
selection committee who put in hard work to evaluate a number 
of outstanding candidates, and put forth their assessment to 
our Senators. I thank my ABA evaluator, who it was truly a 
pleasure to get to know during this process. And last, I thank 
Chair Durbin, Ranking Member Graham, and all of the honorable 
Members of this Committee for holding this hearing today.
    To my friends and colleagues who have supported me during 
this process, your encouragement will not be forgotten. To my 
brother and sister judges back in Multnomah County, I'm 
grateful for your friendship and your willingness to cover 
extra matters in order to allow me to be here today. It is an 
honor to serve alongside you.
    I'm equally grateful to my judicial assistant and to my 
clerk for the quality that they bring to work each and every 
day. To my brother, my uncle, my aunts, my in-laws, nieces, and 
nephews watching from afar, thank you for your support and well 
wishes.
    And last, I would like to acknowledge my family who've 
traveled to be here with me today. My mom, my sister, my 
husband, and my children. They asked me not to gush about them 
here this morning. And at this time, I will display judicial 
restraint by respecting their wishes. With that, Senators, I 
welcome your questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, very much. Judge Brisco.

STATEMENT OF HON. CRISTAL C. BRISCO, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS UNITED 
   STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA

    Judge Brisco. Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Graham, and 
Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to be 
here today.
    Thank you, President Biden, for nominating me to serve on 
the United States District Court for the Northern District of 
Indiana. This nomination is the highest honor of my career, and 
I am grateful for your trust and confidence placed in me. My 
home State Senators, Senator Young and Senator Braun, and their 
staffs, thank you for your support throughout the nomination 
process. And to Senator Young, I am deeply humbled and grateful 
for your very kind introductory remarks.
    Also, I am especially thankful to have the opportunity to 
introduce my beloved family, who is here with me today. My 
husband, Brian, he has supported me in every personal and 
professional goal since our teenage years. He will forever be 
my high school sweetheart. He is my best friend. Brian, thank 
you for your unconditional love and support.
    Our wonderful daughters, Brianna, and Alexa, I thank God 
daily for your choosing me to be their mom. They bring me so 
much joy. Girls, soak this moment in. Let today be a reminder 
that the sky is the limit. Work hard, do good, trust God, and 
always listen to your mother.
    [Laughter.]
    My brother, Marcus Clark, traveled from Collierville, 
Tennessee. He is my biggest cheerleader. No matter my age or 
title, I will always be his baby sister, and I wouldn't have it 
any other way. My parents, Alvin and Gail Clark, are here from 
Olive Branch, Mississippi. They provided a foundation grounded 
in faith, love of country and family, and commitment to 
service.
    My parents made countless sacrifices to provide me with an 
excellent education. Their hard work and unwavering optimism 
inspire me daily. Without them, I could not have accomplished 
all that I have. Mom and dad, I am so proud to be your 
daughter. Thank you for everything.
    And finally, I'd like to thank the many people praying for 
and encouraging me every step of the way: my family and friends 
watching from home, the Holy Trinity Parish and School 
community, Andrean High School, Valparaiso University, 
University of Notre Dame, and my Indiana State Court family. 
Senators, I look forward to your questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, all, very much. Judge Lund, you 
have significant judicial experience in Indiana--oh, I'm sorry. 
You get to speak first. I jumped ahead.
    Judge Lund. I was all prepared.
    [Laughter.]
    Chair Durbin. You convinced me.

STATEMENT OF HON. GRETCHEN S. LUND, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS UNITED 
   STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA

    Judge Lund. Thank you, Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member 
Graham, and all of the Members of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee for holding this hearing today. Thank you, President 
Biden, for the profound honor of my nomination to the United 
States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana. 
Thank you, Senator Young and Senator Braun, for your support of 
my nomination. And thank you Senator Young, for your kind 
remarks earlier today.
    I come before this Committee as the proud daughter of an 
Indiana farm family. I am joined by my parents, David and Diane 
Hess, and my brother, Jim Hess. They are all proud Indiana 
farmers. My parents taught my brother and I the importance of a 
hard day's work, putting your faith in that which you cannot 
see, and approaching life with a servant's heart to your 
community. Mom and dad, I am proud to be an Indiana farm kid 
today.
    I am also joined by my husband, Jeff, and our girls, Elsa 
and Ingrid. Jeff has been my teammate, best friend, and biggest 
supporter for over 20 years. Elsa and Ingrid are both 
incredibly smart and amazingly talented. Girls, as your mom, I 
look forward to the day when I can sit behind you and support 
you in your life's work. As for now, I want to thank Jeff and 
the girls for just supporting mom, not just today, but always.
    I want to thank my court family, watching from courthouses 
all across the State of Indiana. Thank you to my court staff in 
Elkhart Superior Court 4, to my Elkhart County judicial 
colleagues, and to my judicial colleagues and friends all 
across Indiana. It is an honor to serve as a judge in the great 
State of Indiana for the past 15 years.
    And finally, I want to publicly thank two judges that have 
had a profound impact on my judicial career: Judge Bill 
Lawrence of the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of Indiana, whom I clerked for, and Judge Terry 
Shewmaker of the Elkhart Circuit Court, who served as my mentor 
early in my judicial career. Both of these judges showed me how 
a judge can have a firm grasp on the law and administer justice 
in a way that makes all litigants and lawyers feel heard and 
respected. I want to thank each of them for showing me how to 
be a good judge.
    Again, I want to thank the Committee for this hearing, and 
I look forward to your questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you very much, Judge Lund. And now the 
question I couldn't wait to ask. You have significant 
experience. You've talked about it in your opening, but you've 
also talked about experiences in the community inspired by your 
efforts to start Elkhart County's first drug court. We need to 
learn a lot more about addiction, and how to treat those who 
are the victims of it. How has your time on the bench and your 
work with the drug court prepared you to deal with this issue 
moving forward?
    Judge Lund. Thank you, Chairman Durbin. As I said, I'm 
honored to have served as a judge in the State of Indiana for 
15 years. I have had, in that capacity, the opportunity to 
oversee cases anywhere from commercial litigation, to a felony 
or misdemeanor case, a domestic relations. So, I have a wide 
variety of legal experience, and have been exposed to many 
areas of the law.
    I thank you for referencing my drug court. That has been a 
new area, in which the Elkhart County community has embraced, 
where we allow for persons who are suffering from substance use 
disorder, that are nonviolent, that are on a track that they 
truly do not wish to be on, to give them an opportunity to be 
held accountable for their criminal actions, but receive 
treatment, supervision, rehabilitation, and mentoring.
    It is our hope that through this, we can restore lives and 
families, and ultimately increase public safety by breaking the 
cycle of addiction. So, thank you for that question.
    Chair Durbin. How's it working?
    Judge Lund. I know I'm a bit biased, but I think it works 
just great. And I say that because I'm excited about the folks 
that have been able to successfully complete the program, and 
to have them come back, with their families, to events and 
opportunities to mentor our participants currently going 
through the program. I've also encountered those, however, that 
were not successful in the program.
    But what is inspiring to me is for them also to return to 
court at times, to let us know that the tools that we provided 
were not for nothing, and that they did learn something through 
the experience. And I think that we all would benefit if we can 
reduce the stigma of substance use disorder in our communities.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Judge Brisco, as I look at your 
background here, starting as a magistrate judge, then being 
appointed by the Governor to serve as a judge on the Superior 
Court, then more recently, the Supreme Court appointed you to 
concurrent service on the Indiana Commercial Court, and you've 
issued approximately 1,818 written decisions. I think you're 
ready. And you certainly have a background to prove it. So, how 
has your experience as a State and local judge really prepared 
you for this Federal opportunity?
    Judge Brisco. Thank you for the question, Senator. My 5 
years as a judicial officer in the State courts of Indiana have 
very well prepared me by teaching me the importance of 
fostering an environment in the courtroom where everyone is 
treated with civility and respect.
    I view my role as keeping the temperature down so that I am 
able to fully listen to the arguments of counsel. Keeping an 
open mind. I roll up my sleeves to put in the work of research 
and study of the law, so that I can issue well-reasoned 
decisions that use clear and accessible language, so that the 
litigants who appear before me, and the public alike, 
understand the reasoning behind, and are able to receive fair 
and impartial justice.
    It's been an honor to serve in the Indiana State Court 
judicial family, and, if I am so confirmed to be an Article III 
judge, I would conduct myself in that same thoughtful, and 
open, and well-reasoned manner. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Judge Baggio, because of your 
background as a public defender, there will be some on the 
Committee, I can just predict, are going to question whether or 
not you have the mindset of a defender instead of being able to 
take care of a case from either a prosecutor's point of view or 
a defense point of view, depending on the law and the facts. 
Would you like to state your position on that?
    Judge Baggio. Yes, thank you for the question, Chair. I 
would say that my last 4\1/2\ years serving on the State court 
bench is the best evidence of the kind of judge that I would 
be, should I be confirmed as a Federal judge.
    And my background as a Federal public defender, those 18 
years during which I represented hundreds of clients, they--
that experience allowed me to develop a real keen sense of the 
importance of clear communication, of empathy for all people 
involved in the system--victims, lawyers, clients--as well as 
the ability to compartmentalize my own personal feelings.
    Because, as a court-appointed counsel, I did not condone 
the acts of my clients, but it was my obligation to set my 
personal feelings aside and fulfill the promise of the Sixth 
Amendment. That ability to compartmentalize my own personal 
feelings is a skill that served me well in my role as a judge 
today. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Judge. Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge, Judge, 
Judge----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Congratulations. Let me start 
with Judge Baggio. Am I saying that right?
    Judge Baggio. Yes, sir, thank you.
    Senator Kennedy. Judge, tell me about Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act, 1964.
    Judge Baggio. Title VI, I believe, Senator, is the 
provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibits the 
discrimination based on religious preferences, I believe--oh, 
I'm sorry. May I strike that? I'm sorry, Senator, I was 
thinking of Title VII. Apologies.
    As you're well aware, I'm sure from my record, Senator, in 
my 18 years of--as a Federal litigator, as well as my 4\1/2\ 
years on the State court bench, I didn't have the opportunity 
to litigate issues related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. 
So, apologies for the misstatement. And, were I to be so 
fortunate to be confirmed, Senator, I would make sure, with no 
uncertainty, that I would be fully fluent in that issue, were 
it to be presented to me on the bench.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Judge Bisco?
    Judge Brisco. It's Brisco.
    Senator Kennedy. Brisco, I apologize.
    Judge Brisco. No problem.
    Senator Kennedy. Tell me about Title VI of the Civil Rights 
Act, 1964.
    Judge Brisco. Senator, in my 17 years as a member of the 
bar and 5 years on the bench, I have not had the occasion to 
address Title VI in my career. However, if I am so fortunate to 
be confirmed as an Article III judge, I would certainly 
research and study to be prepared to address that issue, sir.
    Senator Kennedy. Judge Lund.
    Judge Lund. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. I cannot add 
anything that my panelists have not otherwise add. I can also 
assure you though, in the 15 years that I've had the privilege 
to serve as a judge, that particular provision has not been put 
before me. But if it were to, I would faithfully review it and 
appropriately apply all Supreme Court, United States, and 
Seventh Circuit Court precedent that's put before me.
    Senator Kennedy. Well, Title VI is kind of timely, isn't 
it? I mean, I'm sure you all read the newspapers. Right? Okay. 
Judge Baggio, where does the ``standing requirement'' come 
from?
    Judge Baggio. Senator Kennedy, the standing requirement 
stems from the cases and controversies provision of Article 
III.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Thank you for that. Judge Brisco--I 
got it right this time. Tell me about the ``law of the case 
doctrine.''
    Judge Brisco. The law of the case doctrine is when a case 
has been adjudicated, then there cannot be any other collateral 
claims stemming from the issues that were already litigated.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Thank you for that. Tell me about--
Judge Lund, tell me about ``Federal preemption.''
    Judge Lund. Thank you, Senator, for that question. In just 
using the words in and of themselves, I would assume that, that 
the phrase speaks for itself. That Federal law would preempt 
anything else that would come before it. But again, if I were 
posed with that particular legal phrase, I would do all that I 
could to faithfully review what specifically it is about, and 
faithfully apply that definition to whatever the situation was 
that was posed in front of me.
    Senator Kennedy. Well, where does Federal preemption come 
from?
    Judge Lund. Well, Federal preemption comes from the 
Supremacy Clause, that Federal laws and the Constitution are 
supreme, and State courts are required to uphold them.
    Senator Kennedy. And how do you know if there's Federal 
preemption?
    Judge Lund. Again, I would look toward Article VI of the 
Constitution, which again, is the provision in which----
    Senator Kennedy. You won't--you won't find it there. How do 
you know when Federal preemption happens? You're going to see 
it a lot as a Federal judge.
    Judge Lund. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Again, I would be 
looking toward Supreme Court precedent, Seventh Circuit Court 
of Appeals precedent, to review any of those particular issues 
that would come before the court and would faithfully apply 
them.
    Senator Kennedy. You don't know the rule for determining 
Federal preemption?
    Judge Lund. I could not accurately articulate that today. 
Thank you.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you very much, to the nominees. There 
may be written questions coming your way, and if they do, 
please respond in a timely fashion, if you can. Appreciate it 
very much.
    And thank you, to your friends and family, for being here, 
and supporting you. This meeting of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee stands adjourned.
